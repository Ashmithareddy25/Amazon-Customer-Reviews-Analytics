B008N1LL42|5.0|This was an exciting movie! Originally bought this movie for my son but I enjoyed it myself just as much!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It's in black and white, which is cool. It is dark and seedy, and makes you feel uncomfortable, which is perfect. In the end though, it seemed to try too hard to be intellectual and artsy, but it came off as being merely kitschy.
B001N3ELTO|4.0|Hard to watch, but good film making at its best. Not your hollywood movie with a standard ending.  Had to consult Wiki after watching the movie.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Jiro's sushi makes all others look like vending machine sushi. There's a reason that even though you get what he gives you and it costs at least $300 USD, you need to make a reservation a month in advance.<br /><br />It is also a wonderful look into the backroom of a sushi bar and into the business side of the industry.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|If you buy the pay version, you can download the offline dictionaries, which is good when the WiFi goes down. But with the WiFi you do get more information.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|Well, I would rather be run over by a truck head frist than watch this crap again. Why all the award nods?????I dont understand.. With The Impossible so good it is really unbelievable. Best actress i dont think so.... Oh if only i could vote ...Anyway dont waste your money. But a copy of the The Immposible instead.The only good thing that came out of this production was seeing Larence fall on her way to get her award.bad bad bad..............
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought it for my son, but I have used it more than him. I have got to 75, but not the end yet. A great challenge.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Its a wonderful movie. Get ready to cry it has a sad side. But boy the acting was good. Naomi Watts is outstanding, as is Evan McGregor. they should have both won the Awards.Naomi Watts was up for her part in this wonderful film(didnt win). But i also give a BIG  5 Stars To Tom Holland who plays Lucas the oldest son. He is on his way to great parts in movies. He is that good. And he had enough of McGregor looks to make him his son. It just all worked together so well. WELL WORTH THE MONEY&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; I just cant say enough about this movie full of fear and full of hope/ I just wish all family's could love one another like in this movie.God Bless everyone who was in this film. Please give us more films like this. iam so tried of super hero movies. These people are heros !Based on a true story. I saw the PBS show about them . It was good also.....I little tip. I consider this a family movie. Although there are a few scenes of nudity. But nothing as bad as the so called other super hearo movies i have seen lately/FIVE big stars all the way...................
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This was such a good series and it gives you a feel for the way gladiators would have lived and trained in their day. Great acting and the fighting wasn’t too over the top.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who knows what a great friend and companion a dog can be.<br />Don't miss it.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|I can’t stop watching it. This is my second time around and it’s great. If you haven’t watched it before don’t read the little booklet that comes with it. It gives away way too much information.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I have put off seeing this movie for a couple of years. It didn't do well in the theaters - and now I know why: it doesn't show our history in the most glowing of lights. Compare and contrast this with the defense by John Adams of the British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre. THAT was a proud moment - this (the hanging of Mary Surrat) was shameful. And I guess we just don't like to see our country's warts
193700788X|1.0|It is truly heartbreaking to give this book such a low rating because I have long been such an avid fan of Harris' world-building and unique characters.<br /><br />But Charlaine Harris managed to beat out David Chase (Sopranos) and Anne Bishop (Black Jewel Series) for delivering the most cowardly and frustrating series finale I have ever experienced! Chase, at least, excused his cowardice behind let the Tony fans decide if he was \\"whacked\\" or not.<br /><br />**Fair Warning this review forward contains SPOILERS**<br /><br />Harris, for her part, could not summon the courage to finally address Bill's assault of Sookie nor pen Bill meeting his true death as she originally intended several books ago.<br /><br />I respect an author's right to stick by their original vision for a series ending.<br /><br />However, Harris cannot continue to maintain this was her exact original planned ending for the characters after admitting she changed Bill's fate to accommodate Trueblood. Nor after admitting she added more books than originally planned. Harris' ending would have been \\"fitting\\" about 6 or 7 books ago. Now it felt out-dated and contrived versus a fitting and natural progression. Simply put, Sookie and Eric had outgrown the ending she had planned for them so long ago.<br /><br />I was also left saddened and bitter the author herself holds such a lowly opinion of these two characters.<br /><br />My one wish for Sookie's ending was to finally accept her telepathy as a special gift versus a curse. I wanted her to look in the mirror and see herself as Eric did, a powerful, courageous, gifted woman versus Jason, Bill and Sam's view of her as this cursed victim. Even in the last pages, Sam is seeking reassurance she cannot \\"hear\\" his thoughts as he has always been discomfited by versus embracing of her gift. I found it particularly frustrating Harris contradicted prior books and rewrote Sookie suddenly unable to hear some of his thoughts.<br /><br />Worst of all she leaves Sookie victimized once again. She is denied any real choice and she \\"settles\\" for what love and support she could get from safe Sam who hasn't shown an ounce of real growth since book one. Sadly, our plucky, compassionate and empowered heroine was transformed in this final book into bigoted, unlikeable and security chasing Tara. I was appalled at their similar tone and endings.<br /><br />As for Eric, the book regresses Eric back to circa DAD. My Sookie Stackhouse had a profound impact on this ruthless, charismatic, Viking vampire, yet Harris cannot be bothered to give her male lead any emotional goodbyes with Sookie, Pam or anyone. He is left emasculated and victimized. Any and all prior acts of kindness or love are dismissed by the author's sneering commentary.<br /><br />Finally, Pam was right about Eric sending a message to his queen and master. But, Pam never did understand Eric sought really hard to hide the depth of his Sookie love from fellow vampires. He sold himself for another 100 years to ensure Sookie forever from vampire harm. I wish Sookie had spent more than a few seconds reflecting on that sacrifice and realized there was the bold statement of love and value she long sought from him, and from anyone in her life really. Sadly instead, she spends more time thanking the humans who shunned her for years and hiding away from her true self.<br /><br />Goodbye, Sookie. I don't belong in your narrow-minded, boring world anymore.<br /><br />EDIT UPDATE: In re-reading, I was really struck that CH been ripping of old romance novel cliches with this arrange marriage fiasco - think about it:<br /><br />A social climbing, autocratic father doesn't like that his young rakish son is in love with the local pretty barmaid. Without his son's knowledge, the father arranges a brilliant match with a rich, beautiful, TITLED woman. The rake son balks at having his hands forced. The father and his allies bring down the hammer, marry her OR else you'll be ruined. You will be stripped of all titles and that vulnerable little barmaid of yours will suffer, too.<br /><br />The scared barmaid refuses the rake's request to fight for their love. She feels they are from different social worlds and their love cannot survive those differences.<br /><br />The son reluctantly agrees to the marriage on the absolute condition his pretty barmaid is forever left alone by his new queen and father's allies.  The rakish son finds great pleasure in the marriage bed and some new challenges and years later winds up feeling he made the right choice. The pretty barmaid marries the nice boy next door who has always had a crush on her. They settle down in their sleepy little village and live a perfectly uneventful little life together. The pretty barmaid feels she made the right choice in sticking with her own kind.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />(Gag)<br /><br />CH simply believes because Freyda is a woman, it's not remotely considered more sexual abuse for Eric to be forced/coerced to service her. She's spinning this MARRIAGE gives Eric many perks so he'll be well-paid and thus, well-content. THAT message paints Eric like a prostitute which sadly he is. He sold himself to protect the pretty little barmaid who wants her own kind.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|this item did not come. please make this right. i can;t understand what you all did but no good at all.
0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One is a great introductory and profound sci-fi novel. Do not be fooled by the casual prose that this is merely a gaming novel. It satisfies those who are amateurs or fans of 80s pop culture and channels everyone's inner geeks. The protagonist, Wade Watts, is immersed in OASIS, a virtual reality world where he escapes. One of the most relatable and redeeming qualities about him is his imperfection. He's overweight, socially awkward, and neglected by his family. The reader immediately sympathizes with him. Cline quite clearly paints the dichotomy between OASIS and reality by having \\"Parzival\\" regarded as a celebrity, and Watts as a nonentity. This dichotomy is established to emphasize the book's overall message: you cannot escape from reality. The OASIS cannot be used as a permanent reality for players, for Halliday created the game. Halliday tried to take something infinite--the world--and condensed it into a program. That is OASIS's ultimate flaw. Therefore, Watts realizes that he must return to reality in order to find true happiness. Although this theme has been revisited numerous times, Cline does so in a unique and dystopian way. Watts blocks out all sunlight and has everything delivered to his door in order to extract the best possible experience in the OASIS.<br /><br />This fictional work is seemingly optimistic and superficial. Watts plays, wins the contest, and gets the girl. However, by uncovering layer after layer, one discovers the true profound meaning behind the book. The OASIS is not perfect, and neither is the world. Cline makes us realize selfishness in not only Watts, but in ourselves as well, and how we are always dissatisfied with our lives. Watts learns throughout the course of his journey that he must accept reality and what it has to offer, even though it is flawed.<br /><br />Cline should be highly commended for his imagination, for he created a seminal book. The allusions are carefully picked, but symbolism does not prevail inthis book in comparison to allusions. The dystopian world is painted in a harsh, blunt manner. Although Cline should have been more eloquent in describing the dystopian world, it's important to note that Watts is narrating the novel, and using anything but colloquialism would seem out of place. Despite a lack of eloquence, this novel is a hard book to put down. Although we already know that he wins the search for Halliday's egg, the journey is more satisfying than the destination. The reader enthusiastically turns the page, eager to find out the next challenge that faces Watts. The book takes you on a fictional journey, making you escape from the real world, just like Watts did. However, like all books, it must come to an end, and you must return to reality.

B005MLOKXA|5.0|My wife and I can't wait until after dinner ( sometimes, during dinner --- we use trays and eat in the living room! )<br />to view one, two or on a rare occasion, even three episodes! It's THAT good.<br />Suspense, drama, the wonderful courtroom scenes and of course, how EVERYBODY's got their own agendas.<br />Yeah, this show can certainly make one very cynical.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|very hard to get into - a little weird the way it is written, but I liked the book..,  Sad ending.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Refreshingly clean and well done series with many varied and interesting characters and story lines. Can't wait to see more!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Good read, this book definitely holds your interest.  Shows life from a different perspective.  I would highly recommend.<br />Enjoy folks.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this app for my little sister so she would leave me alone. But I realize that I like it too it is an awesome app I totally request you to buy it. GET IT NOW . I'm now more into it then my little sister.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I saw this for a lot more $ at the local 'sports store'.  This is great for working out in the water and for practicing stroke and form.
B002S45V32|4.0|Not my favorite of the John Hughes movies, but still a good watch.  I enjoy Jon Cryer in this as well.
0061537969|5.0|My brother recommended this book to my (we both love dogs!).  When I found it on Amazon I immediately purchased it and read it in a couple of nights.  What a great story!  Really makes you think!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved the book, love the movie.  Can't wait for sequels.  All the atmosphere of &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I love the pinball games and this one is by far the best one out there. Actually all three are terrific. Would love to see more by Zen offered.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The animation, location and fabulous acting made this a great movie.  Started a bit slow so wondered what it was going to be like but soon caught us up in its spell and we really enjoyed it.  Did not realize how long it was until it was over so allow yourself the allotted time to watch it.
B006RXSM9A|5.0|It's a movie that shows a nice repitoire of dance and song  by C Z-J. we love it a lot
B006S8QY8K|4.0|The Japanese version was better in my opinion. More nuanced. But this was a nice easy, fun to watch movie.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it's fun game. me and my two kids like to play them and take our turn<br />. wish it doesn't  get stuck so often though..
B001CDZZI6|3.0|Good book but it is definitely a hook to get you to pay way more for the information you really want (i.e., a full evaluation)
B0050SYS5A|5.0|We were having trouble in our small room with the system picking up our small 5 year old son. The zoom solved that problem. It's super easy to take off when the adults are going to play.
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|Amazing book...simply said. I would recommend this book for any business person or for anyone wanting to get ahead in life.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This device is absolutely amazing. No wires, no charging cable, no hassles. You literally just get the dongle. Just plug it in the iPod and you're on. Since this takes up the battery from the iPod, you don't have to worry about charging it. It pairs up quickly with my Jabra BT3030. The transmission signal is also good. The dongle is very small so doesn't add any bulk to the iPod. Absolutely love it.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Great book...simply said. I would recommend this book for any business person or for anyone wanting to get ahead in life.
B00BGR8030|3.0|It is about an hour too long, and kind of an awkward movie, but it has some good qualities.  The end is, well, just watch the first 30 minutes, and the last 45 to an hour and that is really all you need.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is sometimes hard to believe how well written this series is, because the acting is so good.  Their timing in both dramatic and comic relief scenes is superb and certainly complements the writing.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Tom Cruise does a nice job in Jack Reacher.  The movie has a good pace and it is not obvious.  Very entertaining and one you will want to see again.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Liked the movie. It was fun. Special effects were really good. My favorite part was the one where a bullet hit Superman's eyes and it fell off.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Probably the most realistic portrayal of an alien invasion. Seriously. Please join me in watching and following Falling Skies. Although, I'm not sure about the requirements of this rating system.
B0015DWLD0|3.0|On the plus side it was not very similar to anything else I've read, but I was anxious for something to happen much of the way through the book.  I have a rare perspective in that I have visited Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai (on business)  - a rare privilege for most westerners. The book lent insights to the culture that are a bit unfathomable for westerners.  Key takeaways for me: 1) the corruption, 2) the garbage in the streets & really (by western standards) odd work hours, 3) the realities & effects of the caste system. (Not necessarily in that order.)  I'd swear, if it weren't for the corruption & &#34;the chicken coop&#34; effect India could lead the world.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Average...Not extremely exciting.  Just another bingo games.  Sure it is fun for others.  Keep it going.  Everyone should enjoy!  Thanks!
B005YVTHT0|2.0|I have not been able to program it properly with sims raceway. The graphics, the steering, all seem, so not real.  Probably, it's just me, but I have given up on it for now, until I at least find someone to try and resolve my problem. So really, I can't give you a real assumption because what I have tried has not worked. It feels  and looks good, and I am anxious to be able to put it to a real test. I like the racing games, not that accomplished though. I have a longitech driving force gt, that has been good for me, which I purchased from you all.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|The movie was very good.  Amazon HD rental  for HD is a premium price.  While I like the convenience I don't use the service very often since IU can rent the blue ray for $1.61
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This one was good, had me confused some. I don't like Corinne she, and I don't like how Gideon keeps messing with her head. Now I can't wait for the third book, so I know what happens.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie was very good.  Amazon HD rental  for HD is a premium price.  While I like the convenience I don't use the service very often since IU can rent the blue ray for $1.61
193700788X|5.0|I am blown away by the vitriolic nature of some of these reviews.  It sounds like some fans liked certain characters, and if those characters don't act the way they expect and want them to, they are gonna stomp their feet and hold their breathe til Ms. Harris changes the books to suit them.  Hey, I was disappointed in the show when it started.  I thought just about everyone was miscast, but guess what; I got used to them.  And the storylines are different, so what?  It's still entertaining.  I loved this book.  The ending was exactly what I hoped.  And I wish that we could revisit Sookie in a few years to see how her happiness, like her garden, is blooming.  I'll always be a fan, and recommend these books to anyone who cares to listen to me.  I also would like to see a new book series with the \\"devil\\" as the main character.  What could she do with THAT?
B004BDC9F6|5.0|It's the Anthology for Bryan Adams, what more is there to say?  If you're a fan you'll love it, if not...then buy something else.  Rock on!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|why must I actually write something out.  This rating system is super duper, really, really, completely dumb and very lame.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|So far I've maybe only heard a couple songs that don't jump out at me with total awesomeness.  Most of the music on this album is really, really good.  Of course you've got to be a Bon Jovi fan to enjoy it.  They've changed a bit over the years, not doing the &#34;glam rock&#34; type of thing, but staying true to just being a great band that seems to really enjoy writing music and playing together.  I just hope they keep it up for years to come  because they're music always seems so fresh and new, even when you think there's nothing else they could come up with to surprise you.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|Still a wonderful, wonderful family film! Even my 2 year old grand daughter loved it, and she seldom watches TV at all.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I'm not sure because, I couldn't get the video to play long enough to watch more than 5 minutes of the movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|JJ Abrams.... I'm always in. The only reason I'm divided is because I know this series is going to end ! Dang !!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|As hard as it was to read about his early life, so much so that I almost didn't finish this book, I'm so glad I read through. It is a book that will make you laugh out loud (the part of his first meeting with Lydia) and cry and ache for all of them left in the orphanage. Thank you for such a brilliant protraile of each and every character in this book. This will always stay with me.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Wonderfully executed. Peer inside the mind of a genius. Take the front seat on his disturbing journey for an answer.
B004UPALT6|1.0|unable to hear it, real bad graphics, you can tell it is from the early 80's lol, dont waste your time.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Im only on Chapter 7, but so far the authors have maintained everything we loved from Robert Jordan.  Im very pleased.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Wow. Great movie! It was better than I expected. Well casted!  Great effects!  Still wouldn't recommend for young people, but a well done movie. Not excited about kids killing kids but when you get head out of that and \\"this is just a movie\\" it was a story on survival.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|Expected the battery to last longer. It is stupid to require a number of words to explain your rating ok?
B00785P2QC|3.0|place an option to purchase this game to play in the mode like the first game was. this game would be more fun to play then waiting for more energy to generate so I can play more.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This will make all your pictures look good. Just turn the flash up so it lights up the room and all your pictures will look SOOO much better. It's expensive, yes. But it's worth it.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|it's the Beatles -- enough said??<br /><br />Again, they want 14 more words for my review...just listen to this music -- it's all the words you need!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Bradley Cooper shines in his performance. Jennifer Lawrence will continue to get Oscar's with great performances as she did in Silver Linings. You know from the start their romance will grow but the baggage will have to be dealt with first. Movie works great for watching on your home TV screen.
B001GXF2YY|3.0|Not as good as his other books. It didn't hold my interest. It was a little hard to follow. I went on line to find the Angel Flight  so I could see what he was talking about.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I download this and was very excited about it, but it had a pop-up that made it very clear to read the terms and conditions before using. Had a lot of stipulations, and requirements to using the app, wasn't a fan so I deleted it.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book two times. It is a amazing story. The book came on time and ...I just love it. I would recommend this to everyone that enjoys reading. However, the ending gets a little cheesy, but the beggining and middle is the sweetest part of it all. :)
B0053TMP24|5.0|I became addicted to this series almost 4 years ago, I have not been able to read them as consistently as I would like, but when I do read the books I can't put them down. Such a fun world to become a part of! :)
1616550414|5.0|The look. The Feel. The Art. This book is beyond what you could ask for if your a Zelda fan. Everything you could ever want to know or read, even the 'big' Zelda timeline. If you have love for this series, you must own this book.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This movie was surprisingly good. Action packed all the way thru. The plot and script were mostly believable and some great twists during the movie. Recommended.
B00992CF6W|2.0|clunky, hard to move about. Cannot place blocks without dropping a whole mess of them because of the too touchy UI. Just not a game for a touch screen device.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use it every day at work. Easier that an I-pod. If I knew it was this simple I would started using it much earlier.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I still believe this is Daniel Day-Lewis' best work, even after seeing him in Lincoln.  If you want a sense of the French and Indian War from a personal perspective, this may be the action packed film for which you've been searching.
B000063V8U|5.0|I have been extremely pleased with everything about this order.  It was shipped swiftly and arrived in good time.  The quality of the product was wonderful.  The process of selecting, ordering, and checking out was very good.  Keep up the good work, everyone!  Thank you for asking for this review!
B005LAIII0|4.0|I loved it!  Great cinematography!  My husband didn't care for it but I thought it was just beautiful! Definetly worth having in your DVD library.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|The suits in the main menu are cool. But i wish i could control the fight speed. But overall its something to do to make the time pass.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love the television series, but I love the books as much.  I would recommend this book for a very interesting read.
B007WQYH4K|5.0|An excellent soundtrack to one of the greatest Westerns of all time. A complete masterpiece. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone WON this one!!
030758836X|3.0|Very slow reading, still trying to get through it. A friend recommended it. Still waiting for the book to get &#34;better&#34;.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This film gave me a deeper compassion for what the mentally ill-at-ease and their families go through in seeking silver linings in otherwise desperate situations. This movie has great depth, and contains all the components that make for a great film. I highly recommend it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Victoria has been in foster care all of her life. This has led her to be guarded and she had difficulty forming relationships with others.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|good mindless read for those who like steamy romance novels<br />is a fast read<br />would recommend this book to those who like steamy romance novels
1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua's book was so honest, you at times believed you were in the journey with her family. You get to follow the quest of a mother in search of making her children the best they can be, now the way she goes about doing this, is debateable. But for anyone who gets the book, please make sure you finish the book, before passing judgement.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|great condition. My son watches this at least once a day. This is a classic movie. I wish there were more E.T. items available for young kids
B001TAJGO6|5.0|The perfection of the script is the chronological manner in which director gives us the movie. The casting was perfect and everyone fits perfectly in the role they play.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I am a huge Hitchcock fan and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Cary Grant is perfect in this role.  He can be funny and then very serious.  He also becomes a hero in the last half of the movie after falling in love with the star, Eva Marie Saint.  I recommend this to any Hitchcock or Cary Grant fan.
B0095GSKDE|5.0|It was so beautiful the way Malcolm Gladwell Analyzed great events and minds and made it so simple for anyone to understand. It's so spread out, the examples he used to explain the secret of success. I truly recommend this book
B000EGEVZK|1.0|I order this DVD two times. The description said region One, but I received copies which where for region 2,3,4,and 5. I gave up and order a used one from E-bay. The actual DVD is very interesting and you see the progression of the Ramones.
1476733953|4.0|It was such a well written book and very descriptive. You practically get invested in the world the author pulls you in.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I read all three books of the series one right after the other and loved all three but I have become a fan of Brandon Sanderson's writing after the &#34;Way of Kings&#34;.  I just can't put his books down.  I listen to them, and read them.
B000L212HC|4.0|It was so great, the movie kept you guessing. I was blown away by the movie. I am a little pissed that it didn't do as well in the boxoffice
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I loved the entire series and this book adds so much between book 1 and 3.  A couple of slow spots but I just could not put it down so I listened to it and read it every chance I could.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Great action movie with a terrific soundtrack .  Robert Downey Jr. is a good actor for the part of Iron Man
B0062IQNG4|5.0|I was looking for one song on this album, after I sampled the rest, I loved them, so I bought it! ;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I live Pinterest. I think it's so useful but be Careful because it is addictive and you may be consumed for hours. Lol

B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Not exactly like the book, but still pretty great.  The actors where perfect for this movie.  I would have like the movie to have been closer to the book.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This a very good book. I like it a lot. And i recommend the book to anyone who likes romance and drama. Two thumbs up!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Young love, family secrets, and a story that intertwined in an amazing way! This is a must read, a book that's hard to put down.

0525950079|4.0|Great book, extremely long.  Stands on its own or read the first installment by Mr. Follett, which continues in this book.
B002BGLP2I|5.0|If you love Mark Knopfler, you will love this album.  MK formed this band for this one album and every song is awesome.
B005M48R86|3.0|It seems to mirror actual events that are unfolding before us everyday.  It's from the child's perspective, so it adds a new point of view on this situation.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|It work just right for me. I will tell all my friends about my charger.  You have to get one.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|this game forces you to wait for the simpilest things ever! this game is like a temple run with shooting but once you die you have to wait for &quot;the suit to repair&quot; then to upgrade takes time while you have to pay a lot to this game also has no way to get out of a couple screens and all you who are thinking of downloading this game beware it takes tons of memory up makes temple run look like it's on steroids and it take all the time in the world! DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT WANT TO LOSE TIME MEMORY!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Its like temple run 2 and 1but you are in the air or fly.<br /><br />But the game is awesome because its like the movie.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips is very talented. He has a great voice and the choices for this CR are great.  I love this CD.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I feel like a lost an hour of my life watching the first part, luckily I managed to fall asleep for the rest.
B00021HBGS|5.0|These have been entertainment in the tub for my 2, 4, & 6 year old kiddos. Easy to store. We love them.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Oscars all around! Every performance was spot on, my only gripe being how dark the movie was, but that was appropriate for the time period.
B0085W09ME|4.0|It is easy to use for searching the best flight options available to a person  according to date and destination.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|what a neat way to keep up with the world we live in!!  I am writhing this not you.........do you want it?
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|Way too much nudity. Turned off before it finished. This is why you should read reviews before viewing. Would not  recommend.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is very fun game. App updates keep it interesting. In Tokyo subway now, enjoying the new sights of the city.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Cute game with lots of fun sim building options. But like a lot of other sim games, it's set up so that unless you're amazingly clever about it, you have to keep spending real money in order to play without having to wait for your depleted resources to build up again. Also, if you're not into posting tons of annoying messages on your social networking page, it's a lot harder to play. I know how that's how they make their money. But personally, I'd rather pay for a game and not have to deal with those annoyances.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Preview made this movie seem like it was going to be a comedy.  It wasn't.  There were a few laughs, but over all it was pretty much a bummer.  Wife and I turned it off halfway through.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I am really pleased with this product.  I primarily use these while gaming, and I am so pleased with the sound quality.  I highly recommend these headphones.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I finished the book, but even tho, these days I have NO trust in my government, this was beyond the pale! Why didn't they just shoot them to begin with and get it over with!
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Fast shipping and great condition. I can watch this series as long as they continue to make them. But I think this is the best filmed when you've seen the entire series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After hearing friends, radio personalities, and critics rave about this series for 3 years, I finally decided to try it with my Amazon Prime account.  As a person who spends little time watching television, I found myself totally addicted and absorbed.  In two marathon days (one weekend!) I watched all of Seasons 1 and 2.  I couldn't hold out to wait for the no-cost version of Season 3; I had to purchase it.  Now my 24 year old daughter is addicted; my 38 year old son is also addicted.  The way the seasons so truly present their eras, you are totally engulfed in a world of another time.  Unusual twists of plot and characters will keep you riveted.
B001HN697M|4.0|Now I know how the war started and am able to complete u collection. At least until the next edition comes out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard about this show from friends and got hooked.  I watched season 1 and 2 already. When will Season 3 be available?
B00AEFZ8OY|4.0|Fast shipping , great condition. Awesome movie but not for the children. Reminds me of the show I used to watch as a kid.
B000X418UE|5.0|Great movie, awesome in Bluray. Watch the extra features to see Micheal Bay with long hair! Packaging was good and the disc was scratch free.
B004742Y68|5.0|A real classic featuring memorable scenes, haunting music, creepy clowns, crazy corpses and all the great little details newer pictures seem to leave out.  While some may wonder at the questionable parenting and refusal to manually change channels in order to avoid a remote control war, this movie is still so much fun to watch.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|hd not bad pics<br />do then me to say bad words it is only a good movie that has a lot of action
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play Solitaire at night when I go to bed. It helps me to wind down so I get to sleep quicker now. I had problems going to sleep because my mind wonders and keeps me awake. Playing Solitaire on the Kindle keeps that from happening and allows me to relax so I can sleep.
B001BKAEHW|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out and ended up wearing out the CD from overplay.  So I downloaded the MP3s to my Cloud.  Listen to it all the time!!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I couldn't hear any difference in the sound when I don't have it on vs when I do have it on
B005EI86JU|5.0|This is an excellently written guide to getting the most from your Nikon D7000. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to learn the ins and outs of their DSLR.
1592407889|2.0|Sachi Parker no doubt had a crummy childhood and has a lot of baggage.  I was hoping the book had a \\"yeah my childhood was crummy, but overcame it\\" positive outcome.  Well I don't think it did.  There is probably a grain of truth in the stories she told, but there are quite a few that seem a little far fetched. For instance, the Cechz or Russian couple that took care of her and let her live with them when she was abandoned in Europe did not speak a word of English and she couldn't speak their language miraculously took care of her and knew exactly what she needed them to do to get home.  Everything seemed to happened to her.  I'm sure if someone threw a rock into a large crowd, it would have hit just her, and her parents wouldn't care to boot.  Her mother seems to have quite the imagination (space aliens coming to visit her and calling her \\"the enlightened one\\") and Sachi seems to have inherited that.<br />I also thought the graphic, TMI tidbits about her sex experiences that she threw in were gross and irrelevant.<br />A better message for the book would have been, I had bad parents, had bad experiences in my life, but I'm an adult in my 50's now and am taking responsibility for my own life and not dwelling on the past.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As always Jack Reacher never disappoints.. Like all Reacher novels the discriptive aspect seems to drag on but worth the time once the action starts.. This book doesn't have quite the bite most stories have but when your hooked in it's hard to put down..<br />And once Jack Reacher starts his revengeful rampage as in all his stories, you can't help to become engulfed along side him in his hunt to bring pain upon those mis-guided individuals who always seem to mess with the wrong man....Can't Wait for the next Jack Reacher adventure...
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I've always enjoyed watching Tina Fey but like her even more after reading this. There was nothing in her book that was earth-shattering or that I was shocked to read but I love the way she thinks. I enjoyed reading more about her life growing up and about how she came to be on Saturday Night Live. I have a lot of respect for how she dealt with her Sarah Palin impersonation; she really seemed concerned that she didn't want to make fun of Ms. Palin (which is hard not to do!). This book won't change your life but you will enjoy it while you're reading it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy Pinterest. I have learned so much from other members pins it is incredible! My recipe collection has quadrupled, I have rediscovered a long lost love of diy crafts, I have even learned to sew on Pinterest. I couldn't possibly put in a small comment how it has opened my world now that I am retired and no longer interact with a group of diverse people. But I get that and more from Pinterest. There are many apps on the web that come and go in my computer, but Pinterest will not be one of them.
B002VT6C0K|3.0|The author's use of language makes the book an easy read.  The situations and their resolutions seem possible, although rather noir.  In all but the last story the characters seem to be meandering through life, responding more or less randomly to random events.  The outcomes left me wondering why I should be particularly interested in them.  I found most of the stories eminently forgettable, despite the author's writing skill.<br /><br />The last story was different, in that it presented historical characters who were deeply interested in things of some import, and worked hard to make progress toward goals that they thought significant.  This probably reflects the source of the story in the stories of historical mathematicians.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I'm doing anything and everything while playing this. I love it soooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!I play it all the time!!!#
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I use this every day.  I am reading the bible through.  I can keep up with where I am, but sometimes navigation is a little awkward.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A swashbuckling tale as fresh and fun to read as when I first encountered it as a youngster nearly 50 years ago.  The wording is excellent and paints clear and vivid pictures of a time now centuries past but with lessons for today.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This season has been a roller coaster ride of shockingly picturesque scenes and enough creepy images to frighten Stephen King. I dare you to look away. Even though I am creeped out, I come back week after week to watch more. Hugh Dancy is marvelous as Will Graham and I think casting Lawrence Fishburne as Jack Crawford is inspired. Mads Mikkeleson is fantastic as Hannibal Lecter, just great casting all around.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I absolutely dreaded the times I had to put the book down to deal with life. I love how this book told a different story of the characters lives with new problems,characters, and settings. It's a must read!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughters but watch it too! They never get tired of it and more scratched DVD's.
B00908DDZM|5.0|really nice CD enjoying it. you must get this, if you liked thrift shop . the other tracks are cool too
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I've read many negative reviews of &#34;Donald Fagan's latest masterpiece and am truly puzzled. Than again, I can remember reading bad reviews about &#34;Asia and Gaucho&#34;, which are now considered classics. If you're looking for something with hooks and catches you immediately, perhaps you should be listening to the studio produced garbage which is considered music. However if you want some fine music from a master, get this CD. Fagan is in wonderful form and the CD gets better with each listen. Sure it's complex, the arrangements are complex, the compositions are complex and the words are complex, but if you put in the time and give it a chance, you won't be sorry. Some say that Fagen found his niche and repeats the same musical forms, I disagree. &#34;Sunken Condos&#34; is the continuation and evolution of an extremely talented composer and musician. I won't go through all the songs, but each one is a gem. As someone mentioned in another review, like a fine wine, it gets better with each listen and this is so true. Especially touching is Donalds inscription in the credits: &#34;DF loves LT&#34;. Donald, I hope you have another 10 albums in you, starting with &#34;Can't Buy a Thrill&#34; you and Walter have given me a lifetime of musical joy. Thank you so much!<br /><br />Gene Martin<br />California
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Aside from the phenomenal digital graphics, the story appeals to all ages.  The characters find their way into the hearts of children and adults alike.  This is great family entertainment.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|There's a reason this won Best Picture!  It was an amazing yet disturbing movie.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes historical events from the war in the middle east.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great story as usual. I'm sad it's the last one! Can't wait for the follow-up! Charlaine really writes a great character, especially Sookie!
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Matthew McConaughey's transformation from a hustling attorney on the streets to one who actually cared may be far from reality but purely entertaining.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This movie was well done.  My wife winced at the gore in some of the scenes, but it was cleverly done and well acted.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had been told that this show is awesome by my friends and family. I hadn't started to watch during the season, so I decided watch the episodes through amazon. Once I started I couldn't stop! Watched all three seasons in 1 week!
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I thought it was a really good insight into the war. Great acting and story.
B001LM1456|4.0|I'm a new fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and after watching The Avengers, I wanted to fill in some of the backstories that I didn't already know. The Incredible Hulk was the last one that I watched, and it was my least favorite, but that's mostly because I liked the other ones so much better. I thought Edward Norton did a good job portraying the complexity of Bruce Banner, and the action scenes were really great. It just felt like there was something missing... There wasn't as much humor in this movie, which is a huge factor in the Iron Man and Thor movies (for me), so that might be part of it, but the love story also felt a bit flat. The entire origin story is condensed to the opening credits, so for people who haven't been exposed to the Hulk in any other way (me), there's no sense of why these two people love each other. Overall, it was still an enjoyable movie, and it definitely gave me a better appreciation for the Hulk in The Avengers film. Of the two portrayals, I prefer both Mark Ruffalo and the better Hulk CGI in The Avengers, but I'm very glad to have watched this movie.
0446530573|5.0|Haven't tried any of the recipes but wife is a cookbook collector and Soprano fan so it was a big hit as a gift.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Better than Stallone's version in every way, should have been this way to begin with. Go see it now !
061891868X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I loved it.  Lee Smolin is one of the most eminent theoretical physicists alive today, he contributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics, elementary particle physics and theoretical biology.  This book is interesting, insightful and intelligent.  I highly recommend it.
B006GLM5EQ|3.0|I Love the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so had to check out the True Blood series.  Because I do like the books so well, I gave this show 3 stars, but am disappointed in how they made Sookie look like a ditz, and how sappy they made the vampires look. But it is amusing even though they change the characters around.  I will probably watch more - even if it is just to laugh and bitch about how different it is from the books.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Big Doors fan. I had this lp as a teenager and lost it in one of many moves. I am now very happy to have it back. Thanks
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|One reviewer dubbed this \\"a subtle masterpiece\\" and I think that's a fairly accurate description of this fine album. It didn't knock me out the first few times I listened to it, but it grew on me and at some point those subtle hooks and layers of guitar --- and even horns and strings this time around --- and vocal harmonies all merged to hit me and I thought; this really is a very good CD! I still wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's a very satisfying album that should appeal to most Yo La Tengo fans. The music sounds a little familiar at times, and yet refreshingly different at other points. Because the songs are so consistently good --- perhaps without any obvious \\"oh wow\\" moments --- you might be lulled into thinking that this is sub-par album. But that's far from the case. Yo La Tengo serves up another winner.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have Temple Run 1 & II and I really enjoy playing them. This one has different things to watch for.
0226039331|5.0|My husband needed this for his graduate course in Greek and has found it extremely helpful and was just as needed to complete his research and course support needed.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Big Bond fan, and Dainel does a great job. This movie has everything you would want in a Bond film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is an amazing game. Way better then the original. I have them both. I try to unlock everything. I love these apps! But not as much as my blue 3ds xl.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|In general, I do not watch movies or TV (not even the News) without Closed Captions (CC).  I did not watch the entirety, had only begun to watch, this presentation of Pi.  Not to be taking anything away from Pi.  My ratings start at &#34;It's Okay&#34; and go up from there.  It's very rare to come across a film with no redeeming qualities.  I anticipate that, in my book, Pi will rate higher than &#34;It's OK.&#34;  I'm planning on watching the CC option version of this film via a different streaming source.  I am a newcomer to Amazon streaming and thus far have not come across CC format option versions in the Amazon library.  I am hopeful this not a universal Amazon feature.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It is tied  with LOTR. what a great series. LOTR and GOT are best books I've ever read. You will enjoy it.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Daniel Craig is not my favorite 007..... Really. It is an ok movie. If you are looking to really enjoy Bond, Go elsewhere. If you want to see a pretty ok action film, Watch Skyfall.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book that I couldn't put down until I finished. A lot of twists and turns. Can't wait to read another from her.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love this game.  It's simple but fun. The only drawback is that it cost money if you want to get very far.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First reading of author G. Flynn and was very pleasantly surprised.  Became very sympathetic at the beginning of the book to the first person narrator; then, a total reversal.  Very will done.  Will continue to read this author.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty good. It keeps me entertained  for a while!!! VERY ADDICTING!!!!!  This app is great to have because it kills time. The only bad thing is that there are too many ads.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Fourth season was awesome- a little dark compared to the others.  Can't wait for season five.  Best show ever!  worth every penny
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great show......I can't wait for the next season to start.<br />Everyone should watch it..<br />Well done
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the Angry Birds Star Wars!  I did not really care for AB Space but this is one I really enjoy playing.  I am not an expert on the Graphics, if I can see it and it appeals to me then it is great.  Just know I have had as much fun with this addition as I did with Angry Birds and AB Rio and Seasons.<br />Don't know how helpful this review will be to others, I am a 66 year old lady and can only tell you how I personally related to it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Continuing the story of Hunger games, our heroine is targeted by the President as fomenting the revolution. In an attempt to get rid of her and her partner he conspires to have the next Hunger Game consist of all previous winners. This further enrages the districts who's heros and heroines that survived the games are idolized. Even people in the Capitol are upset and confused by this move. But the game goes forward. The handlers who turn out to be revolutionaries make choices that tie our heros to the revolution even further, flaunting the connection in the face of the President. Sometimes in this story the author seems a bit uncertain of where to go and resorts to some &#34;moodiness&#34; and faux drama which don't help the story. Could use some tune up but still a very good story building on the first.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I can't stop watching this movie. You will want to watch it more than twice, It's really affordable, so if you are a fan of QT then this is a must have for your collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The world has turned upside down. The government requires each district to send a child &#34;tribute&#34; to compete to the death in the Hunger Games for their entertainment. The story begins on Tribute day when the children are chosen. One teenage girl's courage and compassion ignite citizen's outrage and spark a revolution.  The Capitol is full of decadent, indulged people who decorate their bodies with dyes, implants, glitter and glitz while the citizens in the districts work in unregulated industries and dangerous labors. Food and medical care is scarce outside the Capitol.<br /><br />This is a good story and a commentary on Haves vs Have Nots. The rich and powerful vs workers. The indulged vs the deprived. Considering the state of things in the world today it may not be far off the mark.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I was absolutely terrified and I loved it! My sister was not going to watch it due to the title.  After you see the movie, it is titled perfectly!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|When we started watching the series we thought it was from PBS, imagine our surprise when in the first episode we saw full frontal nudity and sexual intercourse.  I mention this because if you have children in your homes you may wish to watch the series after they are in bed.<br />The series is supported by a group of performers who are excellent,  They almost make you believe that you are watching history as it occurs.  The sets are realistic and are true to the period of history the show is set in.  If you like &#34;Downtown Abby&#34; give this a try.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Very cute movie about a very detirmend woman. Love these type of movies for my daughter to watch. Now I have to watch it with her.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Nothing short of what you would expect from a movie based on a Nicholas Sparks novel!!  Very good movie Julianne and Josh both did great in there roles although the story-line was some what predictable for a romantic thriller it is well worth seeing!  I will purchase the movie for my collection as well!
B000O77QD8|5.0|This is a great memorial film for remembering the bravery and sacrifices that were made to preserve our freedom and way of life.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Not as good as the book (Cruise is not 6'5&#34; 250 lbs)  Acting was good, as was the dialog.  Kept me involved start to finish.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|In an era when our nation is continuously in some kind of conflict it is fascinating to go back to an era where a soldier is depicted as wrestling with decisions and ethics of fighting and killing.  I know this happens all the time, but Hollywood rarely shows the dissonance that is created by the choices faced by soldiers.  This film gave us a glimpse into that mental struggle.  Classic film which I would recommend for anyone toying with a vocation into the military.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There is little character development, the sex while informative is repetitive, and thus gets boring. The only value I got from the novel was to know what many of my friends are taking about.
B000002GB2|5.0|Styx's early stuff is awesome and this cd is one of their best efforts. Not a bad song on the album and not as commercial as the tommy Shaw inspired Styx material (which I also like, well up until Cornerstone etc). This album has some great grooves on it and some pretty interesting lyrical content. I dig it, check it out!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game every day.  This is the only game I have played longer then a month.fun, entertaining, challenging missions
B000068FXR|5.0|This is probably one of my favourite Supertramp releases. It's great tunes that are well though out both in terms of arrangements and lyrical content. Great musicianship all around and lots of nice grooves and melody. Timeless in many ways and always a great listen!
B0067Q04AM|5.0|If want to hear Jazz through the eyes of young America, this is a must have!  You will not be disappointed.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Have loved this book since the first time I read it (before it was famous) and have reread it many times.  Each time I enjoy it as much as the first.  There's not many books that can give you that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is everything it claims to be and more. The puzzles are challenging and fun! I find it hard to put down.
B008LCRAC0|5.0|They did some interesting things with the show in this final season. Funny and enjoyable as always. Seinfeld is a favorite.
B007VTUYWW|5.0|If you love action and adventure than this is the movie for you.  Strong female lead role is a bonus!  Moments that are amusing and suspenseful, even touching at times.  Purely enjoyable entertainment.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Watched this movie more than any in my youth.  Good movie, good package, enjoy!  You should all know this movie by heart.
193700788X|1.0|I loved this series up until book eight. After book eight it felt like the author didn't care anymore about the story. Dead Ever After was so hard to get through for me. After reading this book I actually felt let down by the author. Did the author forget what she wrote in prior books? I don't need a perfect fairytale ending,but I need an ending that doesn't suck! I wish I could wipe this ending out of my mind,it was a crappy book period! Did the author forget how to write a hot love scene? I know a lot of people who read this book before me and told me how horrible it was. I didn't believe it could be that bad, but I was wrong! SAVE YOUR MONEY! I want to pretend this book didn't happen! It's a shame that this book series which a lot of people loved ended so poorly! I know the author has been getting a lot of threats over this book which is totally uncalled for,but at the same time I understand there pain!
B00004Y6OA|4.0|This album brought back youthful memories of a great band.  Really enjoyed sharing this great music with my children too!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a very cute movie to watch with my boys, ages 7 and 10. My husband and I enjoyed it too. No scary parts thankfully and the only part that I rolled my eyes on is the potty-mouth name calling that occurs. But, that's mild in comparison to the fun of the movie. I would recommend it.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Great cast - fun story.  The quality and delivery were awesome - I've already watched it many times. Blu Ray was a great price.
B008220DGE|5.0|The Master isn't for everyone -- that much is obvious. That's not to say it's esoteric and needs to be \\"got\\"; though, I can tell there is some misunderstanding surrounding the film.<br /><br />In essence, The Master is a love story, a life story, a philosophy [akin to The Cause]. Freddy and Dodd share a brotherly bond that is quite beautiful. In the end, their lives cannot really co-exist in union: Freddy cannot be persuaded by The Cause, ultimately -- his own master is booze and loose women; and Dodd's master is clearly opposed to Freddy's ways. Freddy is freer than some; and, yet, just as bound. He's akin to Diogenes: a citizen of the world, free to roam where he wishes -- usually causing unrest. Even with such freedom, he will always succumb to his vices -- the final moments reflect this.<br /><br />Whatever the case may be, Freddy is a beautiful character in all of his flaws -- child-like, even. And Dodd has the open arms of a welcoming father seeing his son return. However, the movie isn't just an exploration of both of those characters. It's, also, reflective of the time of Freddy's return from the war: the country was searching for its place -- new-age mysticism was rising, promising to answer questions in this nuclear era.<br /><br />The film requires more than one view to fully breathe in the material. Quite worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh my to have to wait for the next season to come out, I was glued and loved the acting
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I can only imagine the great and wonderful reviews that are in the Amazon system for this movie, so I won't add too much. I will say that I just recently watched this when I had some family come over and we all loved it. For me, I generally pick up on the filmography and angles of a film. The team did a wonderful job cutting to and from original footage that was taken during this crisis. There are scenes in which there are a screen full of people and it is not easy to have everything work as planned to truly give off the feeling of suspense and being nervous for those in danger.<br /><br />The movie really paints a beautiful picture of an otherwise sad and gloomy event. Any movie that captures an event and shoots from ways which make you feel like you are a fly on the wall is chilling, to say the least. If you have not seen this yet, I strongly suggest it. After viewing, I had no doubt as to why it won best picture of the year, as it 100% is deserving of such an award.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|A clear, fair and fascinating History lesson on a time often obscured by later events. The arcane and often devious workings of  powerful people in in and out of government is chilling. A lesson for today. And Tomorrow.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I loved it! Would highly recommend this show.  It was very interesting and we couldn't wait to see the next one.E
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I find this program to be interesting, action filled and all the twists and turns in the script make for an intersting hour to my night!
1476734941|5.0|Great book great Diet!!  If you saw the PBS documentary, the book covers everthing that was on it, plus actual diet guidelines.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|The only thing I would change would be to have varying levels of success based on creativity like the DS version. Other than that, it's just as adorable and the levels become fairly challenging deeper into the game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I did not know Victor Hugo could be so interesting!!!  Written so  long ago, yet as compelling today!
B00632HWOG|3.0|A lot of junk mail/spam is getting through.  Just when you think it may have stopped it will start again and with a vengeance.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Much like Temple Run but far more fun. I love building new armies to use. I highly recommend this great game.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This film completely exceeded my expectations! It was awesome...!!! I thought it was going to be the original film, it was the stage show...WAY BETTER!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I love the development on the main character and insights into the North Korean culture and masses. A great read!
B00BRR66SA|3.0|I really, really wanted to love this CD but at the end of the day it is okay.  I love the singles but the rest just seemed a little confusing.  It is a different more of throwback sound if you are into that, you may like it better.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|A good scary movie that consistently maintained my attention. A good continuation of the story. Would recommend for Halloween or a scary movie night
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like this app.  When I have something important that I need to get up for I set my phone's alarm and use this one too! I like the different sounds it offers. Very easy to program.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I wish I had read it before seeing the show. I am looking forward to finishing the series. I have never been a big fan of huge Fantasy series but this is well crafted and very straight forward.
B0019LZV4E|5.0|I loved excellent characters , I like the music and I saw a lot funny things, My Daugther liked too she's was happy !!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This is cool and all but perhaps I really do not need more ways to Google. I find that I use the regular google home page more that the app. It may be just waisting space on my app.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|Behringer! How do they keep doing it? They just keep coming out with excellent products that work and sound like the big dollar equipment but for a fraction of the cost! I have many Behringer products and ALL of them rival their expensive competitors. I just ordered my 5th Behringer XM 8500 Mic. I use them for internet radio show. As others have said they need a windscreen but they sound fantastic. I have a Sure SM58 as well... anyone want to buy it? lol!
B006YC74E8|5.0|I have used it allot and it is very straight forward and easy to use. I would recommended for simply editing photos on my device.<br /><br />Thanks,
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I found this game to be both challenging and entertaining.  It had been along time since I've played Chess. Thankfully there are different levels so I could start slow.  I enjoy the strategic part of this game and the cost (FREE).
B00932A4XE|4.0|I wasn't sure how they could make a movie based on this book, but it was very cute. It was a cute chick flick.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|just a great movie and still would be without all the cursing. Will Smith is one of my favorite actors great movie
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|A great movie remake. I loved the original and the second installment film. I couldn't wait when I heard they were going to make a new one. I took my son to see the movie and was really excited about seeing the new Fright Night. So I had to have it in my DVD collections once it was available. Great movie. Thanks Amazon for great products and prices.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|this movie was just great I love true story movies and this one was wonderful, Everyone should see it. Great
B005LAII3A|5.0|A great movie remake. I loved the original Total Recall with Arnold. I couldn't wait when I heard they were going to make a new one. Although I did not get the chance to see the remake at the show,  I had to have it in my DVD collections once it was available. Great movie. Thanks Amazon for great products and prices.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is so good and keeps you wondering what will happen next this actor was wonderful and kept my attention completely Great Movie
B004SBS8LA|5.0|With every new Angry Birds I get it is a new challenge to get those three stars.  I lose track of time when I play this game it is very addicting.  Have several versions on my Kindle.  The kids and I have wars over who can get the highest scores the whole family gets involved.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|Entertaining and funny.  Barbara Streisand can be comical and serious without effort.  Love Jeff Bridges playing the nerd.  Very nice to look at.
B007OWG3LM|4.0|Valtari is a stunningly beautiful album. More akin to () than anything since with a greater focus on mood than their recent work. That's not to say that Valtari doesn't contain songs with whopping great hooks on (coz it does - see 'Varud') but the whole second half of the album is their most relaxed and ambient side I've heard yet. Pretty potent stuff and definitely worth repeat listens; which is when the full power of this record becomes apparent.<br /><br />I don't think this is their best album, it lacks the scope of their previous albums (Med Sud excluded) but I do think this represents a perfection of their 'Pure Beauty' side. Looking forward to hearing their 'Dirty' side again on Kveikur!<br /><br />This album especially reminded me of a UK band called Takeda, google 'Takeda Regret' I guarantee if you enjoyed this you'll enjoy Takeda.
B001JU4S44|4.0|This was an entertaining movie; full of action, intrigue, and romance.  This word number requirement is for the birds! Bye
0345803485|5.0|Great story with different plot twists. Can't wait to read the next in the series. Interesting story concept but only for adults.
B005K17RU0|4.0|WE ARE USING THIS PRODUCT AND IS VERY MUCH HELPFUL TO OUR ENTIRE FAMILY.  WE ALL CHECK WHETHER ON THIS ACCUWEATHER  BEFORE WE LEAVE OUR HOUSE IN THE MORNING.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|My bf lost this movie years ago, and I surprised him buy buying it for him. We both really enjoy the story.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I LIKED THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH. IT IS VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND USE IT.  WE DOWNLOADED FEW SONGS AND THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great SciFi fun!  The nerd in me has embraced this show.  Great character development, enough intrigue to keep you wondering and guessing...
B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning of this book is so promising and compelling. I wish the author had been able to sustain that for the entire length of the novel. It's one of those books that you start of so excited about and at a certain point, you start to suspect the plot twist, and then there is the letdown in the execution. A for effort. Maybe next time the author can work the story out better all the way to the end.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got this on my kindle for and it was amazing. It's is a little bit to like temple run but it is still good and it is great to play when you need to waste time.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List well deserved the accolades and Oscars it received.  It is a bit Hollywood in its romanticizing of Oskar Schindler but I checked out the facts, and it is a true account of this man's humanity in a bedlam of hatred and maleficence.  Do NOT allow anyone under 18 to watch this movie no matter how mature they are.  It is stark.  It is a triumph,  It is a heartbreak.  Read about Gideon Hausner's account of his connection to the little girl in the red coat.  He was the prosecutor in the Eichman trial in Israel.  My second cousin, Yaakov Wiernik who was at Treblinka, was one of the key witnesses at the trial.  I read his and many other transcripts and came upon comments from Attorney Gideon Hausner and how this affected him when he heard about the account of the little girl in the red coat who was not a fictionalized character in Schindler's List.  She existed.  Hausner had a little girl who was the age of the one in the Schindler account which was told by one of the witnesses at the Eichman trial.  He had just bought his daughter a red coat when the trial was at that point.  He had to stop and compose himself because it touched him so deeply.  Watch for the only colored character in the entire video when you see this film.  Watch for her to reappear later on.  This film will shock and sadden you no matter how much you know about the Holocaust.  If you know nothing or next to nothing, get ready with a lot of tissues.
1476734941|3.0|The book, for the price, could have had more recipts in it for the two days you have to fast....over all it is a good buy
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I watched a few episodes and I enjoyed the story line. Definitely worth the watching. Not your typical court drama sitcom.
193700788X|5.0|I felt that this last installment was good for the series. From the very first book we see how Sookie struggles with her reputation in the town, struggled to fit in her definition of normal, and how little respect she demanded. As time progressed in the series, she grew harder and stronger. By the end, she saw her former friend for what she was and finally realized that YES people in her town care for her justice and well-being. While I'll always be curious as to how things ended up in the lives of all the other characters, big and small, I feel that Harris is justified in leaving that open-ended.<br /><br />I have always loved the relationship between Sookie and Eric, with all their quips and plotting. I feel they had real chemistry together and I would have loved if somehow they made it out together, but I feel Harris did the right thing in letting him go. The more he loved her the more trouble she was going to get into, and the cycle would never end.  She had to settle down sometime, and the final words between them felt so right. I'm glad the cluviel dor, or any other supernatural means, were not used as a deus ex machina for Eric's situation.<br /><br />Sookie's ending with Sam didn't feel tacked on or rushed at all. Harris has always included Sam's admiration and lust for her in the past books, so it was no surprise at all. I feel it's important that Sookie's favorite things were the things she fought for in the end; the sun, control of her life, and peace. The prevailing theme for Sookie was having liberty and control over her own life, while trying hard to be a good person.<br /><br />All in all, I believe Harris receives less credit than she deserves. Few, if any, of her characters are static. She also tackled issues like rape, torture, socioeconomic issues, and racial discrimination, so subtly that I'm sure a lot of readers glossed over it. She's gracefully tackled realistic and confrontational scenes few writers would even think to venture into.  She really put her characters through the long and dusty path of life, and made them grow in a way I could love them. Sookie grew, and the town grew and changed with her. This will be one of the best book series I have ever read. Thank you, Charlaine Harris.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|Tried the PC version quite a bit and would like to buy the paid PC version for $30 to $50, but not at $700!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Lots of challange. Makes u think great for problem solving<br />Very addictive. Sometimes cant put down. Need new levels faster
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|the editing was great movie moves along real nice - characters are all enjoyable - and of course i've always been a fan of helen
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I am interested in games that aren't just your run-of-the-mill, everyday, roll-the-dice-move-your-pawn games.  This one is a lot of fun.  The game is never the same twice and you can have fun playing multiple times in a row.  The quality is good too.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Thrilling, Fun, Extremely tense filled and wonderful! The acting is great and the story always riveting. A must watch! Great!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was wonderful how a young girl was willing to do all she could to save her family and friends from destruction from the evil and save the good in a magical tale that is timely as today's indifference to the worlds troubles.
193700788X|1.0|Spoiler Alert.<br /><br />I don't think I am alone in saying that the last couple of books in the series were left wanting in plot, true character development and were abundant in only two things: 1. complete contradictions on what we knew to be true of certain character personalities (really, we are supposed to believe that Alcide would show up naked in Sookie's bed? That Amelia would plant that and both think it was rational? Come on.) 2. filler. Loads, and loads of filler. And frankly, this book was no different.<br /><br />How can that be? How can the final novel in a series be filler? Well, when a series should have ended several books ago that's easy. And when your author spends 300 pages on the most boring, trivial aspects of a character's life that were entirely freaking new (An, the garden blooming, etc. NONE of this MATTERED at ALL)before getting to the juicy stuff, like who the hell they were looking for, Eric's motivations and oh, you know... Sam/Sookie sex... it was just such a major disappointment. The description of the sexual encounter? Wanting at best. With Eric, Bill, and Quinn we were told of every little muscle and thrust. With Sam, the guy that's been there the whole time, nothing. Just some comments that weren't Sam-like and 'wow' from Sookie. I've heard my grandmother tell steamier stories than that.<br /><br />What made me feel all the more cheated though was that Harris spent all that time on trivial crap that she left no room, none, for any real development of the relationship between Sam and Sookie. Really? She wants to take all the time in the world yet she jumped straight into bed with him. Mixed messages. She couldn't even let us have a full date... no. She had to just have Claude in there somehow.<br /><br />Essentially, Harris wanted to create a situation where he readers would be forced to purchase her follow up companion novel to get any idea of what actually happened to the characters, and it shows. What she could have accomplishedin this novel, maybe even the two before it, was stretched out so far that I can honestly say it has soured me from the whole series, a series I have loved. And that just plain pisses me off.<br /><br />If you can help it, don't buy the book. Worth borrowing a friend's copy or from the library, just to see some sort of empty completion but really, don't line this greedy author's and publisher's pockets anymore than the rest of us already made the mistake of doing. I have been with this series from the beginning, before TrueBlood and I gotta say, I used to hate how Allan Ball perverted the series, now I think he's done more justice than Charlene, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Awfully sad and disappointing, I won't buy another thing from Charlene Harris ever again, that's for sure.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The Movie was wonderful to see and followed the story line in a wonderful manner. I hope all who see this will enjoy it as well.
B00A4YB5I8|5.0|I already liked the original album. The remixes to the already great classics just kick it up a notch. Great work out music too.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The story telling was interesting of how the powers of darkness can seek to destroy all in its path and the steps it took to save various Kingdoms involved and save some from disaster.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game! You can earn diamonds and play for free. Started playing on facebook glad I could get it for my kindle.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Started off very simple but quickly got interesting. Keep up the good work. Can't wait to complete all levels! Go Om Mom, go!
B0097K21YW|3.0|This game is good for wasting time. It starts out simply enough with the Godzilla type creature shooting fireballs at cities. It slowly gets more difficult. It reminds me of stupid zombies. You have to richochett the fireballs (much like bullets in stupid zombies) and uses the law of physics. Not bad but gets aggravating and repetitive.
193700788X|1.0|Two thumbs way down. She did a real dis-service to herself as an author by letting this book come out as it is. I am not saying she made good or bad choices in how she resolved the story lines. I assume she wrote what she was moved to write. My problem is continuity errors that are so glaring and jarring that you suspect a ghost writer, or wonder if you missed a book, where some of these re-writes might have been mentioned or explained. CH's writing has always impressed me with her ability to mix dialogue and action, in such a way that you are smiling along at the humor and fearful at the danger. DEA misses that goal again and again. Scenes are rushed, character development and changes happen in a sentence and the reader is left scratching their head, going \\"Where did that come from?\\". I have read all the AuroraT, HarperC and SVM books and in my opinion this is the weakest book of them all. Sorry to see Sookie go and really sorry she went out like this.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Since purchasing the kindle, my husband has conquered every game,and  will play it until the battery runs out. I started challenging him and was beating him at. First, but now I can't touch him. We've been married for 37 years, I'm so grateful that this game was created, it gives me a break . This is a great way to help a Angry 64 year old retired man with something to do,and not realize,he looks just like those angry little birds.  LOL
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't own an android, so I did not order any apps for an android, even if it was free!  Please take any android ads or orders off my account!  Thank you.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good dictionary with good definitions and a lot of words. I like how you can just click the app instead of opening up an actual dictionary. I wish you can type a letter and then it takes you to that page. JimDooDoo
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Usually I will pause and do some things around the house, but this movie kept me watching the whole movie at one time.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|SARAH'S KEY will capture your attention and is difficult to put down.  Not a &#34;summer&#34; read but a riveting story about the French involvement and cooperation with the Nazis during WW11, and reveals a little-known incident about which I had never heard...actually Googled it to find if it was fact or fiction and found to my dismay that it was true.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|It is good so far, but it runs the risk of becoming predictable if it isn't careful.<br /><br />Some historical errors which id surprising for the History Channel.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It's better than book 4.  At least the characters I cared about from the first 3 books were again the main focus.  That being said, the story still moves very slowly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you stink at Temple run play this game than try Temple run after maybe 25 games I swear that it will help!!!!
B0020M99LC|5.0|I loved this movie! It is my new current favorite movie and I have to watch it with my friends? It was thrilling and jaw dropping! I love it!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Jaime Foxx nailed it. This movie was super good. All the actors played their roles well.<br />I saw it as soon as I could rent it.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|there is a lot to like about Vikings, grungy character styling, hot viking men, and gorgeous landscape scenery. The plot and writing of the show is fantastic.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|this movie is action packed, Bale is the dark knight.<br />After watching this I had to watch Bale's previous batman movies.
B005D0TETA|3.0|I have been a Yes fan since the 70's and Yes was the first concert I went to at age 14, is was awesome.  I have a desire to collect their live DVD's as live is Yes at their best.  However, I am somewhat disappointed in this DVD production.  I personally dont care for some of the animation that \\"splits\\" the members at times while watching.  I thought with the title 'Symphonic Live\\" that there would be a professional orchestra playing along with Yes.  It appears that most of this symphony is a high school band that certainly does not display the maturity of a professional symphony.  Overall all I was disappointed.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|this movie was a good movie. The actors worked well together, it was along movie but still interesting.<br />I would recommend this movie.
193700788X|4.0|I am really glad that I read this.  Charlaine Harris let us into her magic world for all these years.  It was a satisfying read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, but hate that the initial black actor guy got killed off. this is the only show that I buy per episode as soon as it is available. Can't wait for season 4.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Love this musical... showed it to my high school students.  Shipped very quickly and easy... Very good condition too!  Although it is a little bit of an older movie, it is still really good for students and they seem to enjoy it.
B004OC07F8|4.0|The book itself is not the answer to all the questions you might have. The thing it did for me was approaching the reinvention of business models and looking at the industry your in differently. This book in addition with Business model canvas (Osterwalder) and the lean startup (Eric Ries) gave tremendous insights.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|I'm sure you have, so you'll find plenty of things he talks on the famous TED talks. It has a deep search on human endeavor as part of our well-being.
B001OBJJSS|5.0|Forgot what some of the women and children went through during the horors of war. Civilazation hasn't improved over the years,in fact it is propably worse.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Can't do without the Weather Channel, especially when I am driving.Have to be prepared. I also like to know what type of weather my friends have elsewhere.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching this show after hearing friends talk about it week after week.  I caved and I LOVE IT!  Awesome show.  Love the history included.  The show draws you in without the cussing, graphic violence, and explicit sex scenes.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The only problem is once I am through with it, there are no more games...But I still have some games to play.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|luv it can't put it down gets my mind thinking, i would suggest this for anyone once you start you can't stop!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I'M SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION. THIS WAS TRUELY A WONDERFUL WATCH!! NICE TO SEE A MOVIE SHOW THE OTHERSIDE OF PARENTING, GIVING A LOOK INTO WHAT FATHERHOOD CAN BE ABOUT. THIS MOVIE WILL TUG ON YOUR EMOTIONS AND TOUCH YOUR HEART IN A VERY GOOD WAY. THE ACTING CAST WAS STELLAR IN THEIR PERFORMANCES AND DEFINATELY WON'T DISAPOINT. THE MOVIE HAS DRAMA, COMEDY, AND THRILLER MOMENTS THROUGHOUT...BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, A MESSAGE OF TRUTH TO BE LEFT ON YOUR MIND WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS..ANYTIME! SEE FOR YOURSELF...AND BELIEVE WITH ME!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this app is amazing I love it you can do missions and it connects to Facebook my five year old daughter loves it and there are so many challenges and opportunities to unlock characters
B0068LYEHA|5.0|It was entertaining, not preachy but a fabulous reminder that women  need to press forward in our quest for equality. Absolutely not a man bashing book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, I had caught part of it on T.V. But had missed some episodes, Now thanks to Amazon.com they have caught me up. If you haven't seen these series, I want to suggest that you look at them. Wonderful, makes you wish you could have lived during those times.Of course I would have been one of the maids or kitchen workers. There was as much drama in the basement of that castle as there was on the first floor. You will fall in love with all the people.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved this movie.  Fast paced, Ben Affleck was great (and a wonderful leading man!) would recommend for a great watch.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is awesome and makes your brain think really fast!  i think it was an awesome wicked cool idea to make this game this way!
B0035HKWM6|3.0|got this movie for my 6 year old nephew after he kept saying he wanted to see the mask.  He loved it and found it funny.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Historic fiction at its best.  Ken Follett comes up with the most amazing and interesting characters.  A fun read with twists from start to finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can you make this game just a little less addictive please. I can play this game hours on end. I like how you have it going to different cities. That's fun.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I am at level 25 and still cannot get my fish...game states a new fish for each rare plant not already grown... not true!!! I absolutely love this game, i have it on my phone as well as my kindle fire, but I am growing weary of planting rare seeds only to get the same plants. I finally grew a rare plant I didn't already have and no new fish. I am embarrassed to say how much money I have spent... so you can imagine my aggravation. I await somebody's reply. the graphics are phenomenal as is the storyline. however the fish take too long to produce just 1 pearl. as I said I love this game.....so PLEASE look into this matter......John.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I have the entire twilight saga now.  I play it over and over and over. Really enjoyed the series.  If I had to be a critic about anything, it would be that Stewart (Bella) has poor enunciation...she slurs her words and it took me to listen closely over and over to catch what she was saying in too many instances in each of the DVD's.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|loveee it. works amazing and its easy. I can take a picture on my phone of a picture on my camera lop an make it look crisp and clean. its awesome.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Skimmed most of the book, but could not finish.<br />I'm not mad that CH did what she did (it's her brain baby after all), I'm angry that she built a relationship for 12+ books only to botch it and say FU to us all, \\"Let's have some Seal loving instead\\" *shudders*<br />I read books with HEA because I can trust the author not to tear my heart into pieces, this shows that I can never ever trust CH again.<br /><br />\\"Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book, as part of a promotional tour, in return for an honest review.\\"
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I had seen this movie before but Love Matthew Mcconaughey. He is, like the movie Awesome!  Well written thriller with great character development.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really enjoy playing this, but it's frustrating when you don't have enough credits to play the new rooms you unlock. At least there 5 free games a day with the tournament....
B009IA9OLE|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this game but it turned out to be a lot of fun.  It's a combination RPG/Strategy game.  There are different &#34;builds&#34; that allow you to replay a couple of times with a different experience.<br /><br />My recommendation to the developer is that only 2 out of the 3 build trees are viable to win the game.  If they made a sequel, I hope that they add more build trees so that players can experiment more.<br /><br />Played fine on Kindle Fire 1st gen.
B009KUANWG|5.0|SKYFALL, IT'S SKYFALL<br /><br />there now you know the hook of the song. look you probably already know the melody, it won an Oscar, IT'S ADELE, stop kidding yourself and just buy it
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I had played this before on the PC and it was just as fun on the Kindle Fire.<br />The game is a strategy game that lies somewhere in-between Build-A-Lot and My Kingdom for the Princess.<br />The levels are challenging, and getting a gold star on some of them are challenging indeed, which allows for a lot of replayability.<br /><br />I hope that they release Royal Envoy 2 on the kindle fire soon!
B00BUCXVPI|2.0|Loved the book and the movie I thought was well done. Very much like the book. Loved having Robert DuVall play the gun range owner. However, they couldn't have made a worse choice when they cast Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher. Tom is a great actor, but was simply not believable in this role. What was Lee Child thinking?
B00913DPW2|1.0|I bought this game due to the good reviews from other players.  Not sure why it's gotten any good reviews.<br />The game is totally unintuitive.  You cant' figure out what to do, where to go, etc.  Not recommended.  Don't waste your money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was surprised. my friend wanted me to get it so I did. I thought it was going to be one of those care games you get bored with after 30min. but no. good graphics to
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is certainly the quintessential account of Near Death Experiences.<br />It's another proof of God's amazing creation for this world and the next.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This was a great book. A third generation of world changers. This was a well written story but I really want to see what happens next.
B0028K3192|5.0|MY MOM ADORES MAXWELL!!! SHE PLAYED THIS CD SOOOOO MUCH THAT IT STOPPED WORKING LOL! & SO I PURCHASED HER ANOTHER ONE!<br /><br />THANKS AMAZON!
B0079TQHDO|5.0|This book wasn't long enough. I wanted more. I enjoyed the story so much that I wanted it to keep going. Emma's character is way beyond her time and very exciting.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Inspirational, well written, empowering, and thought provoking. I've recommended this book to all of my friends and coworkers. Thanks Sheryl!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book kept my interest the whole read! I loved Will's (Robie)character even though he was a killer I wanted him to live through this ordeal so I could read about him and his life again. I just bought the book &#34;The Hit&#34; which has Will in it, yea! Sorry I am not much of a writer but I do love to read and would highly recommend this book to someone who loves an action packed adventure!!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Being a native of south Louisiana, and seeing so many inaccuracies associated with &#34;hollywood&#34; trying to portray the culture and the terrible way they butcher the dialect of the cajun and creole people of the areas.  I was pleased to see that this movie actually was very well directed in continuity in this aspect.  Additionally, I thought the story line was very good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use<br />Helpful notifications<br />Smooth running app, so far no troubles with it.  I'd recommend this app for anyone
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Let's see, a crime show involving a murder mystery writer and a detective who looks like she just stepped off the fashion runway...must be silly trash. Not! The show continues to entertain. Nathan Fillion is still trying to inherit the mantle of quirkiest actor from William Shatner. That said, his performance continues to hold up and is very entertaining. What can I say about Stana Katic? She is drop dead gorgeous...and she can actually act. Molly C. Quinn is good as the daughter, Susan Sullivan chews the scenery as the mother, both Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever are excellent as detectives. Great show!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This book was recommended by a friend who loved it.  I wish I could say the same.  It was tedious.  Too much wordy repetition, too slow, too many passages the were irrelevant to the story.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Not since the Sopranos has a show about criminals been so engaging and made its criminal characters so sympathetic. The show is full of surprises and plot twists. I am totally addicted.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great, no disappointment ending for this series. I will look for others from Brandon Sanderson. Robert Jordan, I believe, would be proud.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|great book an easy read good perspective from the soldiers point of view with out giving away any sensitive information I would recommend
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Fyi for motion sickness folks: may make you dizzy due to hand held type camera work.<br />Lots of good emotion and good acting. Very real in some ways
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a good film and Jamie Fox did a very good job in his role as Django. I hate that they killed off his partner, the doctor.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Who would not like two of the great musicians of our time in seemingly different genres  getting together such listening pleasure
B00992CF6W|3.0|its so fun you can build,kill zombies, and even play with friends the only thing I bated about it was when I set my world on survival like a day or so later it would change to creative all by itself its very annoying especially when u did a lot on that world.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this show and the second season was even better! I wasn't sure how good this one would be after a crazy plot twist in the first season but I was completely wrong!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|For a light hearted comedy that any married couple should enjoy, its worth watching. Pretty long for a comedy... but still worth a watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|David Zahn<br /><br />I recently purchased this game for my 5 year old grandson to play on his Nabi2 tablet. Needless to say he absolutely  loves it and is constantly playing it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The app is nice and a lot of fun, but gems do not always appear after you view or download an advertised app.

B00CBRH4YU|4.0|To The Wonder (2012): A romantic drama art film centered on a man's affair (Ben Affleck) with a girl from his hometown past (Rachel McAdams) as his relationship with a French woman falls apart (Olga Kurylenko). As a Terrence Malick film (The Tree of Life, The Thin Red Line), To The Wonder is an unconventional story of passion, betrayal, regret, and the fleeting emotions encompassing the complexity of monogamous love. Told through layers of natural landscape shots of Paris and the American Midwest, as well as with narrative consciousness in place of dialogue, Malick intentionally gives his story a contemplative sense of pacing as he allows his unique vision of imagery and sound to give his themes and characters an expanse of interpretation beyond the reach of a script. To many audiences, To The Wonder may be deemed too slow or lacking in dramatic development but is nonetheless a film that reaches to give new meaning not only to the joy and tragedy of commitment but to the renewal of hope in place of despair. Javier Bardem also gives insightful perspective as a disillusioned priest struggling to find God when surrounded by misfortune and grief in his own community.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Got this dvd to add to my collection of dvds. Haven't watched it yet but it is on my list of movies to watch when the tv shows I like are off the air for the summer

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! Easy to use and so addicting! I could browse for hours! It is the perfect app to show you anything you want to do... From recipes to what-to plant in your garden to repel deer! Most pins have a link to give you a tutorial on how to make the project...which is awesome especially for the person who really needs it!
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|This movie is about locating a fish.  They ultimately do locate the fish.  The intermediate journey (to locate said fish) is pretty entertaining.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love this band, love the music. Nate has a distinct voice that is wonderful. get this album as soon as you can
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is a film which did not do as well as it should of when it was released in theaters.<br />It is a much better movie than given credit for by most of the critics.  Slammed as a<br />pop culture, cliff notes' version of the actual story, it is far more than that and actually<br />does much more justice to the Airmen's legacy than you would think.  It is well-acted,<br />well-produced and, in the final analysis, will be long-remembered as an entertaining<br />film that giave audiences a solid understanding of the Tuskegee Airmen and their<br />rightful place in history.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best stories about life and humanity I've ever read.<br /><br />As Americans, we only really know our side of WWII--As the book repeated reminds us, not all Germans by any stretch were Party members.  It's beyond imagination what the average German citizen and soldiers not of the party endured to remain alive.<br /><br />Very hard to put down once you start.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|This is a fantastic Suede album. It really DOES sound as if it fits between Dog Man Star and Coming Up. And, like some reviewers (even &#34;professional&#34; ones) have stated, it has slightly sub-par mastering, but even with that, the album is still very good. (When I say 'sub-par mastering' I am referring to the well known volume level/clipping/loudness wars epidemic! ...BTW... when are people gonna figure out that cranking up the gain or whatever unprofessional thing most studios do these days RUINS the recording, NOT make it sound better! The iPod generation has ALOT TO LEARN about sound quality! And it doesn't take too much effort to accomplish. Are they teaching this in sound engineering school for deaf and dim witted people or what??? It goes to show that not everybody that likes music is MUSICALLY INCLINED, and SHOULD NOT go into music as a career! They should be required to take a legit music appreciation course and a prerequisite of having musical talent and taste before someone gets behind ANY mixing board!!!) ---RANT RANT RANT... and so on...<br /><br />Anyway... what the f was I saying? (it just gets me so so mad)... what I was getting at is the mastering leaves much to be desired, but thanks to the band, it doesn't detract from the fact that the music is still very good. Just the fact that Brett Anderson's voice sounds so stunning, as if he just picked up from Dog man Star and is seemingly nearly 20 years younger is astonishing! I mean, a singer's voice IS his instrument, and it ages like anything else, and his voice, you must understand, sounds like it did nearly 20 years ago! Better than the last couple albums even! (Which were also some time ago.)<br /><br /> Just take David Bowie, for an example... I love Bowie, and am also happy that he just released another album. BUT, his voice hasn't sounded like Ziggy since... well, maybe Aladdin Sane. Even Scary Monsters, with all of his range, it has been a long time since we heard THAT Bowie, hasn't it? I just wanted people to realize what a feat this really is. To release an album that really no one thought would ever happen, and then for it to have such great Suede-esque flavor to have it stand up to their past glory days, it is almost unprecedented. Could you imagine if Bowie had the capacity (or balls) to pull off something like an album that resembled his Ziggy-balls-out glory days, and it worked? WOW, hey? Well that is what this Suede reunion album is. And it is just that... a reunion album (the best they could do without Butler, no offense to Richard, he's fantastic, but I am such a big fan of the first 2 albums) and it sounds better than 99 percent of any other &#34;reunion&#34; album released. (And that goes for the new &#34;Black Sabbath&#34; album ---of who I am a HUGE fan of the original lineup--- and without Bill Ward on drums, doesn't quite make it a reunion album now, does it?)...<br /><br />Anyway!!! Sorry, again getting sidetracked. To summarize... if you like Suede, and even are just a Butler-era Suede snob, you should pick this up and give it a serious listen. Because that is what Suede deserves. A SERIOUS LISTEN. It is a miracle this album even exists, yet alone has such good songs, and such fantastic, ageless vocals from one of rock's greatest voices, in my opinion. A must have album, in my opinion. In fact, I am telling you, buy this right now! Do it! You will be happier for it. Thanks for reading my review and having good taste in music ;)realize what a feat this really is.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|It was a long but enjoyable read - perhaps long because i most often read it while traveling. I liked the pacing back and forth across the time periods and how the women solved their mystery over time. I also liked the completeness, closure at the end. I will try her other books - because she is a good storyteller.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I love the series and am a fan of both Atlantis and Stargate. Maybe the producers got tired of it, but I didn't.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Recommend this ebook ... found it to be well done and really appreciate having the option to purchase it in the ebook option.
1607066017|5.0|With the amount of reviews available, it's pretty clear that SAAAAAGAAAAA is the real deal, from the story(admittedly not for everybody, but a space drama as good as this one is perfect for me), to the art (as a personal note, not knowing who Fionna Staples is before this, and not knowing the amazing art she can do is a shame), to the handwritten narration, everything adds to a great comic book. The only downside I can pick is in the lack of any extras, sketches or additionañ content. I have a Walking Dead trade and I know it's commonplace with Image TPBs, but with such a great comic book, one can become spoiled to greatness.<br /><br />And c'mon, 6 USD for a TPB, let alone a great one? BUY IT!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The imagery captures the surreal world of the mind in great distress.  The resourcefulness of Pi, his cunning is apparent early on in his struggle to survive the cruel tauntings of his peers.  Pi will survive at any cost and will never eat meat again!

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I love happy endings especially since I work in mental health and they are infrequent. The acting was superb, each character playing off the other so beautifully.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a very graphic action movie.Lowered the moral means to obtain a justified end. This was a good movie!!
B00499NHLC|4.0|A different twist on the old Sherlock Holmes, but kept me interested for &#34;English&#34; production. They are few episodes but long, 1.5 hr each.
B009DZDJU6|3.0|When I first saw the ads for this movie, I just laughed. Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? I imagined a silly movie and it being a waste of time. Then I overheard people talking about it and decided to give it a shot while it is running on HBO.<br /><br />I will admit, this movie is far better than I expected. Abe kicks butt and swings a mean axe. However, he doesn't do it often enough. The action(fight scenes), are well done and impressive. The attempt to mix history with the vampire hunting takes up too much action time. I feel that people watching this movie are not watching the movie for the historical aspect. Yet, the historical part was not overly boring.<br /><br />I have seen the movie twice. I missed a lot during my first view. In my opinion, the biggest selling point of this movie is the fight scenes and there are simply not enough of them. At present, Amazon is not allowing rentals and the purchase price is $15.99. I don't feel this is a movie worth owning. However, I do feel it is worth a $1.99 rental.<br /><br />3 stars. It's ok.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I was wasn't offended as much as I was disappointed that Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington would be in a movie that downplayed the slavery experience. Even when I sat my issue with that aside I grew bored of Tarantino's overdone style.
B000091KWX|5.0|super speedy delivery vintage great awesome album in great condition. get r signed in july here in my home town by mike tramp himself .
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie! Tarantino does it again. Such a fun movie to watch. Love the characters and the actors choose to play them./
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I watched the musical with tears and goose bumbs . It held me captive to the wonderful acting ,the beautiful music and the Oscar performance that Hugh Jackman should have won.  He's outstanding in mastering his craft to the peek of perfection.  I would say that HUGH JACKMAN  was cheated out of his Oscar.
B007CKZQIW|5.0|Frank McCourt's novel was a very touching and thoughtful novel. It was a rare treat reading this book. I cannot say enough about this story
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|My favorite author for many many years has been Tom Clancy.  Somehow, him sharing writing a story with another author, the GLUE that makes it such an interesting read isn't as intense.<br />The first time I read 'Patriot Games' I found myself slowing down toward the end as I enjoyed the story - when I did finish felt I could start on page 1 and read again.  It was that way with most of his books.<br />When the presidential election is coming up, I rely on the type of man Jack Ryan was and hope to find a real candidate with that type of Patriotism and Dedication.<br />How sad that we now don't have the choice of voting for the better candidate, but rather the one most likely NOT to do the most damage.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This season is only 3 episodes long, but it certainly leaves you wanting more. It reminds me of Downton Abbey.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|It was a thinner. it makes u think about flying now. denzel was great in movie. must see movie for any family
1452110581|5.0|While reading, my sweet cat curled up next to me and was so confused why I was cry-laughing. Hilarious little collection of poems to remind us why we love our feline friends, even when they try to scan and print documents at 4:30am.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|lot of action good actors. I like how it was set back in the old school days. must see asap
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Beautifully written, intense visual effects especially on 3d,kept audience's attention throughtout. A spiritually focused movie that will nourish the soul.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Like how you have the free bingo games and the slots all in one. I really like that you can check the numbers to see if you missed one.
006107327X|5.0|What Bruce Timm and Paul Dini did for animation is proof in this incredible book that details the process that went into making one of the ground breaking television series of my childhood.  This book contains all the title cards that each episode premiered, the process of how the opening sequence went and the stuff Warner Brothers banned from ever showing!  I bought this a few years back, and any time I need inspiration to draw from: I chose this book.
B009EE08NC|5.0|It was nice to see african Americans in a positive environment!! Also web I learned that nick cannon had to learn the drums and actually perform that was also nice to know!
1401227821|5.0|Adam Hughes in my mind can do no wrong.  I've been a fan of his work for some years now, he is approachable at conventions and his sketchbooks are always fast sellers.  So it's no wonder that this gem of a classic collection of his amazing covers that ranged from Justice League of America, to Wonder Woman, and finally Catwoman.  You get the rough pencils with the finished product, and the insight that it took from his humorous ways.  Adam Hughes to me is a Norman Rockwell of our generation, so his pictures tell a story within a story.  I was lucky to get this signed by him in person. If you ever come across this book anywhere; trust me and buy it!
B006TQUNX8|5.0|I chose this book to bulk up on my base of &#34;classics&#34; and I'm so glad I did. I love Oscar Wilde's writing style, so sad this was the only novel he wrote. From the very beginning I was mesmerized and was quite sad to finish the book. A classic story of the perils of vanity, I don't want to give anything away, just read it. It's a pretty quick read too.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|True classic of class, grace respect and good acting. Cary Grant can do no wrong in whatever character he plays plus he's sexy
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Mykids and I really enjoy watching this one together. Its not your typical kids movie. Its just nice. A good view of life, growing up and getting older, and trying to find ones place in it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Clever logic problems that require spatial reasoning and situational awareness. The story that's tied into the whole thing is dark and intriguing.  Has me eager for the sequel.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|It was very well done! quite impressive for a prequil. Better than the Lord of the Rings. The kids and I bought it even though its only half the story. We can't wait for the other half.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|it is a nice place to meet new people.  great for a social network. it helps people meet interesting people.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It was pretty riveting most of the time and really mysterious. Just trying to figure out what was going on was half the fun. But it was kind of weak at the end and left a lot of questions kind of loose.
0345529057|4.0|Great set for someone who wants to get into the show and all the various backstories surrounding the characters on the show that may only be seen in passing.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game! It does not crash like other games. I like the catch the animals rather than just buy them.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It is wonderful every time I read it..  Jane Austen is the best..<br />I have enjoyed, loved every book  of hers that I have reax
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I became aware of Downton Abbey late in the season, so I wanted to catch up on the earlier episodes.  It is a mesmerizing story of British life!
B0078Q2HAA|2.0|I'm sure I've seen worse movies, but not more disappointing ones. The fault, dear brutalized, is not in the stars, but in the sentimental, semi psychological  assault the writer and director perpetrate on the prime minister's story and on the viewing audience.  I'm rather sure that it is the opposite of the way Ms. Thatcher would have liked her life to be portrayed.<br /><br />A glance at the interview with screenwriter Abi Morgan ([...] that this project went wrong at the start.  She states a comment from Ms. Thatcher's daughter about her mother's dementia was the most intriguing thing to her about her  subject's life and the script goes on to highlight Ms. Morgan's speculations on the subject. . Surely there are more important things to focus on in a biopic about the first woman Prime Minister of England who led the country for eleven significant years. Many may have disagreed with her, but a movie which glosses over Ms. Thatcher's devotion to principles and ideas is an insult to an accomplished woman's life. If the film LINCOLN took this approach, it would have been panned unceasingly.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie about dementia, get The Notebook and avoid this dog.  If you want to know something about Margaret Thatcher, avoid this dog also.  I haven't seen the documentary of the same name or the fictionalized Rise and Fall set, but they are well-reviewed and can't possibly have been worse.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|For me it came down to weather Tom Cruise could pull off Jack Reacher a 6.5 250 pound hard ass he pulled off the hard ass excellent very entertaining movie
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought this as a gift, absolutely love it! Such an adorable toy. Perfect for a boy or a girl.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is a great look into the murky world of high finance.  It is a world unto itself.  How can so much money fall into the hands of so few.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I bought this game with my granddaughter in mind but must confess that I am addicted to it.  What I love is the ability to use my tablet as the steering wheel instead of just tapping it on the sides.  It took a lot of practice to get the hang of steering but I do better now although I have taken out a lot of seagulls and buildings, among other items.  If you know someone who loves to race by all means get this app.  BTW my granddaughter got the hang of it immediately and does much better than I do.  Buy it you'll love it.
0307352153|5.0|The book is inspiring and practical.  It inspired me to joing toastmasters.  It keeps your attention.  It is lifechanging.  The assertions are supported with solid research.  I would recommend the book for introverts but would especially recommend it for extroverts.  The book points out that it takes both kinds to optimize success.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a great deal of fun for an adult. I'm not sure if a kid under the age of 12 would be able to get very far in it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is the best show I have seen on ABC in a loooooooong time. More like this and their ratings would go up. I am tired of reality, dance, and American Idol. Those shows are getting old.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|the characters as portrayed in the movie were true to the characters in the book.  It is my favorite of Burke's Robideaux novels and the film does it justice<br />.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Need more like these...finally something on television to look forward to. Wish it was on @ 9 though, 10 is late.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is always surprising you and sometimes it's all I can do to not hold my breath during a particularly stressful scene. Not good for watching before bed - it will keep you up all night long worrying and wondering about the intricate plot lines.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really love this game money well spent I play it every day! It's my favorite game u guys who r looking at this NEED  to buy it.
B00985E3UG|5.0|You'll never have to go on a diet again if you read this incredible expose of the food industry. Processed food is now so disgusting to me that I just can't eat stupid anymore. No effort required, it's that much of a game changer.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It's been a while since I've read this one. However, what I've said regarding Baldacci's books applies to this one too. I find his books hard to put down. Thank you.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it with my kids and it they enjoyed all the  beautiful colors and animals in the movie.  It was good for family movie night.
0425263916|5.0|All three books are great! I cant wait till the third book comes out. This book is the kinda book you just can't put down. Also surprising the reader. Good love story and the cat and mouse chase makes the book very fun!

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The last book to grab me like this was Name of the Wind by Rothfuss.  I love and hate that it's been picked up by Penguin.  Love it because it'll mean this book gets the mass exposure it deserves.  Hate it because even if the second book was done today we'll have to wait for the first release of the printed edition of this book to come out then some more just to allow build up to happen.  We won't likely see book two for at least a year because of it and that wait will be a hard thing to endure. Still the wait will be worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have all three books in hardcover and decided to take the next step and put it on my kindle. I love this book, if you have read the first you know what I mean. You get to know the characters so well that when something happens to them you want to cry with them cause you feel that close. Great book
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love this alarm clock. I don't have to rely on my wife to set her cell phone. It doesn't take up too much memory on the Kindle Fire and I can use the alarm clock without turning the Kindle device on. I set the alarm and make sure my volume is up loud enough for when it goes off. I can change the time or establish a new alarm. It's a simple alarm clock with a practical application.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It wasn't what I expected but the movie was good and acting was amazing.  I wish It would have went more in depth with the characters.  A must see however.
0385334206|5.0|I am a huge Kurt Vonnegut fan. I've loved almost everything I've read from him. Breakfast of Champions is one of my favorites. Maybe it's because I grew up in the Mikey age and remember all those old Wheaties commercials, so this satire strikes my nerve. But I also like Vonnegut's pencil drawings. They add a little additional flavor to the text. Awesome book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was a 5 star book all the way to the last two pages. I would much rather seen 20 page of a well written epilog than the last 2 pages I got.
B008602KQI|4.0|I didn't read the book, but I could tell from the story arc that there were things left out. I liked the characters, and I liked the story line. By main disappointment in the story is that there wasn't as much action in it as I'd expected there to be based on the hype around the story. That told, it's a great movie. I may just have to read the book.

I refused to play them. But I got bored one day and decided to do something different. Now I play this game when I should be doing something else.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This Three-Disc Special Edition is really a great deal for the price and all the special edition discs are really great to watch as well as the actual movie. My four year old loves watching the special edition DVDs as well as the movie. It is trully a great buy for the price.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A true story that makes you think, cringe, cry a little yet remains light in tone throughout. It really gets under your skin if you let it. An intelligent and emotional person in a disabled body wants friends, lovers, and maybe even a wife. Is it possible?  Maybe, but it's not so simple. What if you fall in love with a friend?  What if you want loveless sex but can't separate your feelings?  Sounds like real life for any of us. But if you're inside a lifeless body and need constant attendants your life is an open book for all. Could you deal with this?  This man tried and mostly succeeded, against all odds, including by living nearly 50 years past his predicted life expectancy.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story is set in a small town in Ireland where two people, from different backgrounds, are tired of their everyday existences and seek to find someone to share life with.  Through the prompting of friends, they take out ads in the local paper and that is when the adventure begins.  These are not beautiful people with wonderful lives.  They are just seeking some joy in the middle of mediocrity.  There are some twists and turns, surprises and gut wrenching revelations about their backgrounds.  All said, it was worth the read just to get to know the main characters and celebrate the determination they had to pursue hope.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|It's good to acquire this series when you have a little time on your hands, because one episode leads to another, and soon you're looking for season 2. Good actors, good camera work, and suspenseful story. Quite like 24 Hours in that regard.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I think the program is good but the ads are very annoying. I deleted it from my Kindle. When they produce an ad free version, I might reconsider. But the company seems a bit cheesy to me.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The almost mythical hero of this tale pulls the reader through a land more absurd and frightening than 1984. But the land exists, the absurdity is a self-imposed, and the psychotic behavior of the  Beloved Leader a part of our daily newspaper. Only in such a Theatre of the Absurd could this well written tale take place and seem so real. An excellent read and perfect choice for this year's Pulitzer.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|Its sad because I had just bought this camera from my father, and it had 2 pictures worth of film left to be used which I did and after that I was worried I wouldn't find more film. So in  long shot i bought this film and when I used it in my camera the film all had a brownish tan patch of film at the top. Each photo I took had them but I was slightly peeved at seeing it, then after waiting 30 minutes my pictures came out a bit blotchy. Over all not satisfied. I would have returned it except I used the film and I want to keep the small patchy photos of my family.

0596007124|5.0|My friend needed an introduction to various design patterns to help her improve her programming skills.  English was not her first language, and I did not want to get her anything difficult to comprehend.  Thus, I opted to buy her this book over the &#34;Gang of Four&#34; book.  After she read the first chapter, her thoughts on the book were effusively positive.  She said the text was example driven, and very straightforward.  Reading it seems to make her happy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Won't go into it. Just buy and read this book immediately. Haven't been touched like this by a book in years.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Reminds me of early X-Files, plus the chemistry between the three lead characters is off the chart. Stories are usually self-contained but also propel the overall storyline. Very enjoyable. If you liked the X-Files and miss it, try Fringe. You won't be disappointed.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I call it that because I can't think of anything else to call it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I kept thinking 'When is this silliness gonna stop, and when will the real film really start.' Now I don't mind a film being somewhat deceptive so as to hide some things. I take offense to a film or filmmakers being deliberately deceptive with total and utter false advertising. Hey if they are scared to really write and show the Real Mandarin, that is their right. Just leave the character out of the film altogether. Don't give the middle finger to true and longtime fans who have been begging for a true Iron Man/Mandarin showdown since the first Iron Man film was announced. We don't have to go see it a second time. If you really want to pander to kid-friendly audiences that is also your right, but trust me when I tell you this. They don't outnumber real and longtime fans. Your playing a dangerous game. Casual fans eventually move on to something newer or more exciting.<br /><br />As an action film, Iron Man 3 isn't really that bad. This isn't the real Iron Man IMO. It's clear to me that the new director either knows nothing about Iron Man, or simply didn't care. This is a hatchet job if I've ever seen one. Bad enough I don't get to see the Real Mandarin, I also have to endure an annoying little kid throughout and Iron Man barely in one of his many armors. Sorry to have to tell some of these arrogant and self-indulgent filmmakers this, but contrary to your popular belief or need, but many of us really do prefer the hero in his costume or armor. It's why we first pick up those comic books in the first place. Please quit trying to rehabilitate heroes that don't need saved or early retirement. Truth is, heroes aren't actually supposed to age much anyway.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I liked the first 2/3 of the book but then the sort of &#34;clean up&#34; phase got boring for me.  Clearly Max Brooks has thought A LOT about what would happen in a zombie apocalypse though.
B00C7KXUOE|1.0|Hannibal is bad, unless you like to see body pars being prepared for food and classical music playing in the background. Very boring, should be canceled very soon. Networks would do better with Zombie projects like the Walking Dead, Please no more CSI network programs.

B00AJV4G28|5.0|Buddy is truly one of the greats, as evidenced by this excellent live recording from one of the finest blues venues, which he happens to own, in Chicago.  Although the music is at times perhaps a bit excessive on the &#34;heavy electric&#34; style, it is clear that age has only made Buddy better a better blues singer, writer and guitarist.  The quality of the sound and other aspects in the recording are very good too.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil himself mentioned this:  that people either loved this or hated it. It DID win a Hugo and Nebula, so apparently many people thought it was good.  The first time I read it, I was given a copy of the book by a colleague because he didn't like it.  I couldn't put it down.  I got this on Kindle because I lost my copy and it was on sale.  I am really looking forward to rereading it.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Wanted to see this, thought would be funny and it was just okay.  The story could have had more to it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Hard to explain.  It was faerie plus real world side-by-side.  But it made sense.  It was consistent.  It had unexpected, but logical in retrospect, plot twists and turns.  That's hard to do well, but he did.  And the loose ends tied up nicely.  The ending made sense.  I don't know how to express it except that he writes good.  Real good.  Good turns of phrase.  Worth a read.

B009R659L8|5.0|As usual I could not put this Mary Higgins Clark book down until I finished.  MHC has a. way of weaving a story to keep you guessing. Even when you think you know the answer you are never quit sure until the very end.  She is one of my favorite mystery authors.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Very unique approach to movie making combined with theoretically possible science . . . Well, partially.  Some scientist suggest that particle physics may allow for another universe which mirrors this one.  Maybe harboring another \\"us\\".  Maybe in the outer reaches of scientific logic, but still, an interesting movie concept.  The earth like planet making it's way into what appears to be lunar distance orbit is another matter, but it does make for a story with a new and refreshing approach.  Brit Marling is a naturally pretty and intelligent actress and plays this melancholy role in an extremely believable fashion.  I like the way the story was so realistically played with the tragic circumstances being what they were, while this astounding event was also about to take place.  The conclusion wasn't shocking.  It was thought provoking.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie quite like it.  Really interesting!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|great movie.  highly underrated.  what else can i say?  it's iron man dude.  the best super hero series that's come out in awhile.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|one of the best love stories ever put to film. mainly the beginning and end of a couple's story, has some funny parts, an interesting story, and some parts that make you say, &#34;no he/she didn't&#34;

193700788X|1.0|I am terribly disappointed with this book. (There WILL be spoilers)<br /><br />I am a voracious reader. When I first found the Sookie Stackhouse books, I read ten of them inside of a week. That's correct, I would read 1.5 books in a single day, with a toddler at home. Just for reference on how fast I read. Dead Ever After - alone - took me two days of forcing myself to read it before it was done.<br /><br />I'm relieved it's over. Why? Because Sookie was crass and bigoted, Eric was stripped of everything he worked for, Pam barely showed up at all, the \\"great\\" mystery plot was the killing of a character that everyone hated by characters nobody really remembered, and the entire story felt like it was cobbled together from post-it notes left on the floor of the copy room. This book was not worth the money charged for it in bookstores, nor was it worth the money invested in the series. Yes, the story belongs to the author, but the expectation is that the reader will receive a product of value equal to the price paid for the book.<br /><br />Sadly, this was not the case in Dead Ever After. The readers deserved a story that was well thought out, mythology that was consistent, continuity that was set, a plot without holes, and characters that actually served a purpose other than that of \\"See? I put them in the final book!\\" The purpose of a final book is to BE a final book - not to drive sales of a CODA that contains the things that SHOULD have been included in Dead Ever After. This was a disappointment from first chapter to last, and if this is the best book Ms Harris could produce, I vastly overestimated her writing ability.<br /><br />Worst of all, I think, is the notion that the man who assaulted and nearly drained Sookie, then RAPED HER? That man is now living happily across the cemetery from her, is now her best friend ever, and is the person she turns to for relationship advice. She allows her abuser to kiss her, and even debates having sex with him. In the meantime,Harris, who has embraced the notion that her stories are analogous to the LGBTQ fight for marriage equality... Spends the entirety of the book doing so much \\"othering\\" it made my stomach turn. Sookie went from an open-minded, easy-going, lovable young woman with courage, and a desire to do well for herself and turned spontaneously into a closed minded, bigoted shrew with little wit, dull thoughts, and who needed her word of the day calendar to keep up with everyday conversation.<br /><br />This is all completely without mention of the plot itself. You could park Merlotte's in the holes - seriously, who sells their soul to A devil (not THE devil, though the difference is never explained by the author!) for a wish so they can wish for an item to make a wish! The continuity was atrocious - the notion that the readers are so dull as to not remember the bounds of Sookie's telepathy is insulting. Truthfully, the entire \\"third person point of view\\" plot is utterly ridiculous.  This book is an utter disappointment, and a horrible ending to a cheerful and uplifting series.
B00BL5YQKS|2.0|I Didn't Like the Guys Attitude And Disregard. plus The Show Promotes Corrupted Cops And it's Too Close To Reality That It Bugs Me How Lawless Many Cops Can Be And Get away With It.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Sorry for the very long review, but I felt I should give my (almost) complete thoughts and analysis. The first two paragraphs are my analysis and thoughts on the music itself and the last part is what I find wrong with it (what's missing). If I were you I'd probably just look over the last section to see what isn't there. As far as the product itself goes, it arrived quickly and while I'm not a fan of the paper case (which requires some struggling to open), I haven't had any issues with the quality of the CDs.<br /><br />First off, let me start by saying that this music is some of my favorite and I have almost no complaints about the music itself. We all probably know how amazing it is, but I'll add my thoughts just because. I feel the movie version of Les Mis surpasses all other versions partly because it's not attached to any strict tempo which allows for more emotion in the voices and a much more natural feel. What we're hearing is what we're seeing when we watch the movie--the actors are being recorded live as they're acting, which means they can get into the moment and convey much more feeling. As a result, the orchestration is also more fluid and is much richer. The redone orchestrations are very stirring and more diverse, with tiny nuances which, if you listen for them, are oftentimes more beautiful than the melodies. Unlike the slightly more repetitively orchestrated previous versions, these orchestrations are always changing and dynamic. As an example, if you just listen closely to the instruments in \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" and you can catch the lilting harp accompaniment, gorgeous solo violin parts, melancholy English horn lines, in addition to stunning orchestra swells that you don't always pay attention to. Also, one of my favorite additions is the strings/woodwinds in the second verse of \\"Stars\\" which perfectly tie in and are some of the more beautiful parts in the movie. Listening to that will hugely increase your appreciation of the music.<br /><br />Having said enough about the instrumentation, I'll throw out my opinion on the vocals. First off, probably the most debated voice is that of Hugh Jackman. Jackman, in my opinion, is an absolutely fantastic actor but a rather mediocre singer. In fact, the first time I heard his voice I was disappointed. It's very raw and unfiltered sounding, but after a while it's really grown on me. The reason is because it's so dripping with emotion. I just listened to his performance of \\"Valjean's Soliloquy\\" on this CD, which I originally didn't care for, and it nearly put a lump in my throat with how emotional and intense it was! So if you don't like his voice now, you might later. Moving on, Russell Crowe is the best Javert by far. His voice is so rich and powerful without coming across as harsh like Philip Quast's voice is (to me). Anne Hathaway was an excellent Fantine, and I think that's mutually agreed by everyone. Even the critical reviews I've read of the movie all had to admit she did a fantastic job. Her emotion was present not only in \\"I Dreamed\\" but I (once again) almost got a lump in my throat from hearing her in \\"Fantine's Arrest\\" and \\"Fantine's Death.\\" Despite what people say about Amanda Seyfried's voice, I think she did a very nice job as Cossette. Yes it's laden with vibrato, but for once I actually didn't mind the vibrato. All in all, I think she has a very pretty voice. Eddie Redmayne also has a very bold, pleasant voice. And finally, Samantha Barks is probably the best Eponine. While Lea Salonga was certainly an excellent singer, I think Samantha Barks is better, by a slim margin. To me it sounds like her voice is purer and more pleasant.<br /><br />However, despite how much I love this album, I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could. As was mentioned by several reviewers before, this is not a complete recordings. Some of the songs are chopped down, other bits of singing were totally omitted, which I thought was kind of disappointing. It might seem nitpicky because it doesn't really affect the listening pleasure quite so much, but as a hobby I'm an arranger/transcriber and I'd like to have access to all of the soundtrack for those purposes. Listening to the album, I can pinpoint where much of the music is missing and I personally would have liked this info when I purchased it. So, while I certainly haven't discovered everything which is missing, this is some of what I've found (if you catch anything I haven't, feel free to tell me in the comments):<br /><br />Disk 1:<br />-Track 1: Probably one of the most obvious and disappointing, Look Down has been cut in the middle; much of the body of the verse is totally gone (all of the convicts' part), and so is the second playing of the orchestra fanfare when Valjean retrieves the flag for Javert. However, this track did include the beautiful oboe-laden part when Valjean is \\"free\\" and starting to travel (Which accounts for the extra time, the rest is the same as the Highlights album).<br />-Track 2: The music accompanying Valjean on parole and the entire section where he is welcomed by the bishop is missing. All this has is when he's caught by the guards and the bishop shows his compassion.<br />-Track 4: Some is cut including Fantine's plea to the foreman after \\"Monsieur le Maire\\" leaves.<br />-All of the times Valjean and Javert talk (well, sing) to each other while Valjean is the Mayor is gone, most notably the whole part where Valjean rescues M. Fauchelevent by pulling up the cart. I really liked the sound of the melody where Javert says \\"Can this be true? I don't believe what I'm seeing,\\" but that's all missing.<br />-Track 7: The parts where M. Bamatabois confronts Javert and tries to get Fantine arrested (and when she pleads) isn't there, it starts when Valjean intervenes.<br />-Track 8: The confrontation where Javert confesses to Valjean is missing.<br />-Track 13: The reprise of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" where Valjean relays to the Thenardiers that he will take Cosette is gone,it starts right from his first encounter with Cosette to the Waltz of Treachery.<br />-(Track 18-ish) The parts where Eponine and Marius converse is gone, including when Marius begs her to find Cosette and she has a brief soliloquy<br />-(Track 22-ish) The attack on the Rue Plumet scene is gone, including where Valjean hurriedly leaves with Cosette.<br />That's all I could find for now for disk 1.<br />Disk 2:<br />-When Valjean enters the barricade and all of his parts (including his receipt of Marius's letter) before \\"Bring Him Home\\" (Track 7) are all absent, including when he lets Javert go. I was disappointed at the entire omission of that critical moment.<br />-Track 8: Though this isn't an omission, I wanted to include how relieved I was when they DID include the part where the sergeant confronted those at the barricade. I love that bit of singing, and I was afraid that it was going to be missing when I got the album, but thankfully it's not.<br />-The end credits suite is missing! There's plenty of room on the second disk for that, but it's totally gone. The suite is especially beautiful and I have no clue as to why it's omitted.<br />Really, that's all I have to say about Disk 2, which says a lot in how there's not much gone.<br /><br />So would I recommend this? Without a doubt. If you're debating about purchasing this and can't decide because some content is gone, let me say it's certainly worth it, even if you have the Highlights album already. The missing content isn't too great and doesn't overshadow how much more is there. It's a minor regret. Especially if you're a Les Mis fan, this incredible album is essential to have.

B004J64QSI|5.0|I first saw this on PBS, (hence the title of this review) and was totally blown away. (and okay, it didn't hurt that Ramin Karimloo was in it. Gorgeous, gorgeous man, with a voice to match!)<br /><br />I don't know whose idea it was to do these musicals as concerts, but they deserve serious kudos.<br /><br />And of course as a bonus they have the Valjeans, from Colm Wilkinson to Alfie Boe together singing Bring HIm Home.<br /><br />Another plus (as far as I'm concerned) is that we didn't have to see what was done to Fantine. Lea Salonga brought that across with body language and facial expressions.<br /><br />I haven't yet seen the recent movie version of Les Mis, but somehow I can't believe it will be better than this.<br /><br />And as I said, you don't have to sit through any pledge breaks.

B0099Y2YL6|1.0|My family and I love watching Downton Abbey. When it went off of On Demand, we bought it from Amazon as soon as we could. However, when we first started watching we noticed that the first disc had sound to video delay of about one second. The second disc was no better, but we weathered through it because we love Downton Abbey. When we put in the third disc, our DVD player ejected it and said &#34;Disc not supported&#34;. We have a blu-ray player and we tried it at least 4 other times, to no avail.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|great movie, good amount of special features, all of them interesting. I will watch this movie again and again, so well worth it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I Love the full screen display and that it is easy to use.  Great for finding totals when on the go!
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|I love this cd I could not wait for it to come out it has some fanastic music on it I am dancing as I write this its one of the best cds I have in my collection
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just finished watching past seven seasons and had to catch up on the current season.  Hoping that the CW will continue the show in the future.
193700788X|1.0|Like other reviewers have stated or insinuated, it is clear that CH was tired of Sookie.  This book had the feel of being written by a person who just wanted it over and done with.<br /><br />Perhaps, as others have stated, TrueBlood really WAS a bad thing to happen to Sookie.  Especially when the shows began to deviate widely from the books.  By now, the only connections the books have to the show are the names of the characters.<br /><br />In this book, it seems that CH halfheartedly tries to bring things to a close, and yet left so many loose ends unresolved or resolved in an offhand manner that does nothing to satisfy the reader.<br /><br />Yeah, a lot of major characters show up so we can have a final glimpse. But I would rather have had a good story. Something to show me that CH still cared, even if she was finished with the series.
B0052REUW0|5.0|I'm only 25% of the way through this book and my head is spinning.  This book is well researched, tons of references, and drags you along to conclusions you just KNEW are wrong.  Turns out, the world today the most violent ever.  If you're feeling today sucks, buy this book and feel better.
0448444216|5.0|My 20 month old loves lift a flap books. They are very interactive and makes her want to sit through a book rather than just reading alone. Eric Carle always does a great job!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This is the best free fighter game I have ever played!!! Would recommend for all fighter enthusiasts. BUY THIS GAME. It has a wide variety of jets.
B008BRC7BE|4.0|Nice mix of rarities and a few classics. I would recommend to any Deep Purple/Sabbath fans. Interesting liner notes too.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was such a fan of this series.. I feel like I have been reading about this character for 5 years and to have it end the way it did was so disappointing.. I felt like the author was just trying to tie up every story line from the beginning of the series... The fact that I read it in three hours just shows you how lacking the storyline was and how easy it was to get through.. I cannot believe I am actually saying this in a review for a book..but it really just sucked.. I guess the author felt like she could not end the book any other way since sookie was never going to be anything but human... the fact that this is the last book was just really disappointing..
B000LGOPW2|4.0|Burton did a find job building on the original story. Have long loved this tale and this film did not disappoint.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|too repetitious; same things said way too many times.<br />Does not seem to move in terms of time , year to year.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|The first part about their boyhood was too long. And then little story line after that. Was a bit disappointed. I expected more of a story.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show! inventive, smart and so aristocratic, makes period dramas look so cool...Add season 3 to prime members please!
B00364K6YW|5.0|The story unfolds and you are draw in to a great story.  The actors are well cast and deliver wonderful performances.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I missed out on so much by not owning my own copy of this! Be sure to watch the commentary.
193700788X|1.0|This was a terrible book, it was not just the Sam thing, I had already accepted the fact that Sookie was not going to have her HEA with Eric, but man, the way this author ended Eric was a slap in the face for a huge amount of fans of  this series,  the worst part and what upsets me more is that she knew how important Eric was for the fans, she just didn't give a F***, and the great explanation that so many people give is that these were HER characters, HER books, HER series...well my answer to that: it is also MY money and MY time, and I'm sure of something, I won't waste them in this author never again.<br /><br />Now I feel the need to apologize to all those people who I recommended these books, and like me, were misguided to love a relationship that the author knew from the beginning that had no future. SORRY :(<br /><br />P.S. If the TV show wants to go this route, I would prefer that the rumors are true, and they kill Eric this season, that way I would not have to lose more time in this too. (sorry for my English...it is not my first lenguage)
B009NF54ZE|1.0|Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. When you get to the end of Chapter 4 and can't find the last object, it won't give you a hint, and of course you can't go any further. So in essence, it's worthless.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Truly insightful. I'm not one for 'self-help' books, but this allowed me to change my behaviors and establish new routines literally from the first few pages. Even though it is sectioned for the individual, the company, and society; all three sections can be used for personal habit reform. I would recommend this to anyone who has been angry with themselves for not quitting smoking or cutting caffeine or even sticking to a workout routine. The book also brought to light habits I didn't know I had, both good and bad. Charles draws out the road map to molding yourself into the person you want to be. Its really enriching and I would suggest this to everyone. Great Book!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a great game, fantastic for all ages.  I also like the fact that they are releasing updates with good frequency.
0786838655|1.0|I find much of this book's content to be very inappropriate for 9-12 year olds.  My 9 year old read most of it before I sat down with him to read the chapter on their trip to the 'underworld'.  I couldn't believe my son had checked this book out from his elementary school library. I then read other sections of the book and decided this would be the last book by this author that my son would read - at least as a child.  Kids heads are being filled with garbage...no good could come from it.
B00338QENI|4.0|The book was well written and gave our book club LOTS to discuss.  Kept me thinking about the characters for a long time after reading it....
B008ODZEQ0|3.0|Was surprised to find out that Jiro  is a documentary about a controlling 85 year old who has a miniscule restaurant that has gleaned 3 stars in the Michelin guide.  It deals with his strenuous work ethic, adoration of sushi and domination of his sons.  Stick with Tampopo...much more enjoyable.
1603427244|5.0|I love this book, who knew there were so may ways to cast off and cast on. THANK YOU so much! highly recommend
B001DM1VXE|4.0|great story! we did not have huge expectations, but it was a really fun movie for the whole family. h
159668139X|5.0|this is a friendly and clearly illustrated resource for the beginning weaver, I have it on my nightstand for easy reference
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great story with lots of laughs.  The kids are great, Gru's transformation is nice, and Vector is the best nerdy villain ever.  And everything is topped off with the minions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|the ending was devastating! love the scenery, the costuming, the acting is superb. but, the ending of season 3? break my heart!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This was a silly light hearted movie. Made me laugh several times. I wouldn't recommend this for religious people - movie is critical of fundamentalist and sterotypes them harshly enough that I am commenting on it. So not really the family movie. Paul, the alien, has a very developed human personality and he is well animated - that part was two thumbs up. So for the right crowd - 5 stars. Wait til your preacher Uncle leaves the house.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This is kind of bluesy and slightly country....they sound great together!!!!  Its a fun CD to listen to any time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unsuspected plot that kept me on the edge of my seat!  I suggest that this story is a modern day &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34;, but with a scarier, disfunctional twist.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The series seemed slow to me, starting out. But once past the 3/4 episode, I really started appreciating the small quips between characters which add another dimension of fun to the whole thing. The thing feels fresh, fast and fluid, easy to watch yet lets you reflect on things far deeper. The effects, performances and action is top notch, and Whedon and he gang carved out and highlighted each character with very subtle but powerful moments- the did for character development in the first 10 episodes what most series spend entire seasons at attempting and still failing.<br />The sequel Serenity carries that tradition. Kudos!
B004WMKSH2|5.0|it was awesome. One of the best movies.  My kids enjoyed it and wanted to see more. Keep bring these type of movies.
B0000VD04M|2.0|This is probably one of the worst movies ever made.<br />  Got it because it was a Johnny Depp movie.<br />  Wow! What a mistake.<br />  At the end there is a statement that it is about &#34;the worst Director in movie history.&#34;<br />  Ah ... So the purpose of this disaster is to chronicle the life of ...<br />  Unless you really want to bleed over an early and obviously desperate Mr.Depp ...<br />  DON'T GO HERE!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story was well-written.  The plot was intricate and took the reader on a trip filled with twists and turns.  The ending was &#34;stunning&#34; in every sense of the word.  I would recommend this book to people who enjoy good writing and a gripping narrative.  A modern twist to the &#34;who-dunnit&#34; format.
B000MV9026|5.0|It will keep the small children busy and all the kids loved it even the parents loved it and the teenagers
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed watching this TV series very much.<br />It protrays an interesting perspective on life in Great Britian at the turn of the 20th century.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It kept her busy for awhile and it was very entertaining and good for the children and the family too
B005IQ39AY|4.0|When I awake in the middle of the night, I pull out my Kindle and play a FEW games of Bubbles.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|She's only three and it met her expectations and her sisters and brothers were tickled too, it was worth the money
B007STXHTM|5.0|Very please, would buy again. Will tell others about this product and very well worth the cost. Thanks a lot.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Good book for older people who've read the other books. I think it's great for reading after you finish the other ones
0064430227|5.0|I first saw this book in my before and after care class and later purchased it for a baby shower. It is now one of my favorites. Definitely recommend!
B0018RC7QE|5.0|As fresh and tender as when we were young, their acting touches the heart from memories awakened. The scope of deNiro's acting matches Streep's.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|[[ASIN:B003YCI1O8 Tremors [Blu-ray]]]<br />V: Old film movie made in late 80's but SUPERB Blu-Ray transfer. My dad commented on the night and day difference between the VHS he once watched. Runs full 1080p 16:9. The colors pop and are vivid with no grain, noise, aliasing, or any other video distraction. It shows to me that some real effort went into transferring the original master to Blu-Ray markedly improving it over the DVD release. 4 stars.<br /><br />A: Equipped with Dolby's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (lossless). Even though it's a 25-ish year old movie, tons of discreet surround use were prevalent. I really felt the fear when tremors approached or came out of the ground. The LFE Sub channel gets a workout with lots of low frequencies. The explosions and gunfire really travels from front to surround speakers flawlessly. My favorite was when Fred Ward slams the door, sound appears in left surround, as you can hear Kevin Bacon open a beer in the right channel, etc. Great discreet surround work. I own the DVD and it's noted that the sound engineers obviously remastered from the sub-par DVD which felt as if it was 2 channel stereo the whole movie. Blu-Ray makes it a great cinematic sound experience. 5 stars.
098555780X|5.0|Great pictures and directions. If you want to learn then this is the book to start with. It will hook you into wanting to learn more knots. Let your imagination get fired up.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|[[ASIN:B0064NTZJO Drive (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]<br />V: Shot in 2:40:1 aspect ratio (black bars). One of the worst Blu-Ray transfers VISUALLY (audio is superb though!). i was stunned at how bad it is. I'm comparing this transfer to the brilliant visual transfers of 'The American' and 'I, Robot'. Now my parents couldn't tell a difference, but I could because I'm a cinematic perfectionist. It looked more DVD than Blu-Ray as if I was watching it in the 400-800p rather than the 1080p that Blu-Ray promises. Colors looked mused together, the shadows and tones weren't defined, etc. 2 stars.<br /><br />A: features DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (lossless = no compression). I listen to my music in Stereo so it was awesome to hear the songs in 'Drive' in surround 5.1. The mixers did a great job of separating individual sounds in the music and placing them in specific speakers to give a great sound stage and presence. As in, the mixers put some of the low's that my LFE channel Sub couldn't pick up in my left surround and some of the high's in my front right speaker, etc. The mixers were very specific in their tonal placement. It was a thing of beauty as I've never heard song's like that before. Who else loved the music? WOW. The pawn shop/car chase scene along with the hotel gun fight is DEMO worthy for audiophiles and home theater enthusiasts. My subs were bangin' along with face melting treble in all speakers. Great directionality and panning front front to rear. That helicopter fly over in the opening scene shakes the house! Really feel it! Lastly, the audio in this film wasn't similar to any other movie I've seen. Everything felt REAL as mixers didn't add unnecessary noises or any Foley FX. It felt precise, rather than mused. Hard to explain, just have to have a suitable 5.1 setup to understand what I'm referring to. 5 stars.<br /><br />this was the BEST film of 2011, just horrendous visual Blu-Ray transfer. Audio was superb.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|Archer never disappoints me. Some of his books I like better than others as some appeal more to men I believe, but I never regret even reading his 'lesser ones'.<br />Amazon can almost always hook me to buy another book if it has Archer's name as Author!
B007XF0VW2|4.0|[[ASIN:B004QL7K8E Project X (Extended Cut + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]<br />V: 1080p 16:9. I was skeptical before viewing due to it being a hand-held film, assuming that set use didn't involve any form of external lighting. I was correct as 90% of the film is all 'natural'. The night scenes had high ISO with little noise present, however it felt as it 90% of the movie was 720p, not the full 1080 as Blu-Ray promises. I will blame this on the transfer, not the film itself, due to having the theatrical and extended releases both on 1 disc, thus having to compress the video to save size. With that said, the film had GREAT COLORIZATION. Perfect use of its red's, blue's, and superb skin tone. 3 stars.<br /><br />A: DTS 5.1 compressed audio. My receiver read at 50KHZ, rather than the full 96KHZ of lossless. Great use of rear surrounds with little directional or discreet use, but the surrounds really engulfed you into movie. It wasn't special, but it was effective and made the movie fun. The LFE channel got real workout as my SUB was bangin' throughout. Perfect lows as it made up for the so-so treble compressed. Kid Cudi's 'Pursuit of Happiness' is a home theater demo as the party sounds play from the surrounds with front sound stage playing the song. FUN. 4 stars.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|So many threads starting in disparate places twined into a single directed rope by the end, incredible work by Brandon Sanderson.
B000IDJNJ8|5.0|i think both Sharon Stone and  Michael Douglas were in top shape and very convincing in their parts. The plot of the movie is not that convincing but Sharon Stone was so beautiful and incredibly real as Catherine Tramell that made all very credible.<br />Beautiful movie and great soundtrack too.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Fabulous book for any adventure reader. Anyone with a little wanderlust would really enjoy it. Great for analysis and discussion!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This is a great application for remote access for your laptop or desktop. The setup was fairly easy, and navigation through the smartphone is easy.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I really enjoy this series, I have purchased all of them from Amazon and have been really pleased with the timely manner in which they are shipped and the excellent condition they are in
B0099114WO|5.0|I have not got to watch this movie yet but I know it will be great just because I love the actors
B003L77GRO|5.0|Love this series,  the price is wonderful,  everything always comes on time and  I haven't had any problem with the  condition of the product.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it's fun to play a game that does not require a lot of thinking... zone out game. Fun to play
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|Bought the Wallet option .. I was happy with the quality and also importantly the functionality .. gives me a chance to ditch my wallet :)<br /><br />better than another product that i bought ..
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have used them in the past and could not live without it. I am a mechanical designer using Solidworks, and highly recommend it to anyone using any sort of 3d software. Takes the burden off of the other hand, and once used to it works great.<br />Good Luck
B007W8S2MG|5.0|P4 was one of the few games that I did not buy for my Vita on release day.  The text-heavy interface and overall look of the game just seemed too japanese-y for me (this from someone who loves anime and is fascinated with Japanese culture).  In any case, I kept looking at all the high scores this game was getting - it really is the highest rated game on the Vita.  Still I resisted.  I loved Uncharted, Liberation, Sly Cooper, I had no interest in reading pages of text and turn-based battle seemed the exact opposite of the kind of game I like.  Once the price fell to $30 I decided to try it out - I could always trade it in if I hated it.  Once I started playing this - I was sucked in the storyline, I liked the characters and wanted to spend more time with them.  I turned on auto-progression with the dialog so I didn't have to read text and felt more like I was watching a cartoon.  The voice acting is excellent and just gives the characters more depth.  What really surprised me was the thrill I got in combat.  While the action games require a lot of running around and hacking/shooting foes this game requires analysis and strategy - I know that sounds boring, but there is a real adrenaline rush when you battle bosses that is inexplicable.  The whole game is an enigma to me.  I was completely hooked from start to finish (I put in 90hrs and am considering replaying it a second time) and Atlus did a tremendous job with graphics, sound, acting, story, combat and even technical stuff like short loading and save times.  I can see why they have such a strong following and will definately keep an eye out for other games from them.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I thought the casting for Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman were good but Russell Crowe not so good. Story was interesting for about 30 mins and then it was yawn all the way.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Very good kids movie with action and suspense with a good story line as well as good stories being told within the movie.
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't be happier, this was a great buy at a great price. This book is amazing, I have read it more than once.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a must see movie. It is a great prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Only problem is we all have to wait for the next instalment.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Ok look at the games name Angry Birds Star Wars really do you need to hear more. It is like sun shine rolled in amazing and dipped in hot sause.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Get this for my grand child, but I fell in love with it. Never the same pic, and then you turn on the lights.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is mind numbing and fun. How ever one of the goles is to play a game for like 4 days in a row come on. The finger swiping is alittle touch.
B002PZC8BM|3.0|A little redundant with the villain.  Like Simon Baker and cast.  Interesting plots.  I liked Guardian better. Simon Baker is magnetic.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a thought provoking, inspiring, well made bit of cinematic storytelling. I hope all the facts presented were true, because it felt like an educational experience too.
1878424505|5.0|What is written in the Four Agreements covers all of human frailties: don't take things personally don't assume do your best be honest.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie after all the buzz about it!  It was depressing. Not a comedy as listed. Like most rom-coms, the guy does get the girl in the end, the the journey was boring!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This book was a lot of fun to read.  It pulls the reader into the characters and makes you want to keep reading!
B004I9CXHW|1.0|Does not insert as easy as OEM.<br />Will charge Samsung cell phone but not play music.<br />Will test with new Samsung III and if it does not work, will return it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters/actors are wonderful!  I love the storyline and even the music that is played in the beginning is great!  Can't wait for Season 3.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Everville - The First Pillar by Roy Huff is a bit of a departure for me. It is a young adult fantasy, and is told in the first person.<br /><br />I will admit that I had a hard time getting into the story. The beginning a bit confusing, but I persevered and I am glad I did. Stick with it readers! After the first few pages, this shapes up into a good enjoyable novel.<br /><br />Owen Sage is a rather naïve young man, and is very close to his good friends Dante and Anika. They take an art class together, and they join an art club, as well as the Echo Club. The clubs and the art class are extremely important to the tale.<br /><br />In the world of Everville Owen meets the Keeper. He is a wise old man who is trying protect the the Fron: a race of friendly, short, hairless, large-eared, people. The Fron are in trouble, from an aggressive, ugly race known as Them.<br /><br />Huff's characters are well drawn, and enjoyable. He takes the tale in several quite unpredictable directions, and his system of magic is well thought out and unique. Huff takes the concept of college competition to a new level and makes it fundamental to the tale.<br /><br />It is a first book in a series, and I am sure the next installment will be quite well received. All in all, I give this book four solid stars, and think Mr. Huff has a fine career ahead of him as an author of young adult fantasy.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very interesting. Information found in the book is helpful and easy to understand. It is even helpful for singles looking for love:)
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like this case because it is black and simple.  I am afraid that if I had a colored case it might be more likely to be stolen.  I have not yet figured out how to set it up for the upright standing position, but I don't use the stand much anyway.  It didn't come with instructions on how to use it.  It has an elastic band that I assume if for holding it closed and I really don't use that much either.  I figure the elastic band will stretch out of shape over time.  But yes I do like the case as I have already dropped my Kindle a couple of times and the case protected it perfectly.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Reading this book has lead to a lot of reflection about myself, how I view others, and how I want to raise my children. As a Christian, it has helped to affirm the fact that we have little to no control over what happens to us, and that every success we have in life should be attributed to God.<br /><br />What kept me hooked was a fascination with the cases presented and the method by which Gladwell presented them. I actually read the chapter about airline pilots/crashes while I was on a plane, and I though it was remarkable. It was probably my favorite section of the book.<br /><br />My one complaint was that I felt Gladwell used anecdotal evidence to jump to a hard conclusion on a few occasions, but overall I found his arguments to be very convincing.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Read the book a few yrs ago. Loved it and loved the film just as much. Ordered it on Amazon midway thru watching the movie on cable. Excellent buy.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|i cant wait to watch each week to see what twist and turn they get to investigate. i do miss emily!!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Being a senior, I loved this movie. I bought this copy from Amazon as a gift for another elderly friend. She loved it too.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I chose the highest rating for the convenience of watching it on a mobile device. Plus no commercials!!<br /><br />I like it because the episodes are easy to watch and you can watch them on your timetable.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has an early bedtime. ;)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game. The graphics are top-quality and the controls are responsive. Parts of the gameplay reminds me of Temple Run, so if you enjoy that game, this one should be right up your alley. I absolutely recommend this game.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read every Sookie Stackhouse book & knowing this is the last one makes me sad but happy that it ended in a good way.... It's an excellent read, with unexpected twists & the quirky characters that have made this series so much fun. Can't wait to see what Charlaine Harris comes up with next! :-)
B00BSWMITK|3.0|The music is typical of Joe and sadly is quite predictable.  The music is good but it sounds like every other Satriani recording.  I feel that only hard core fans will appreciate this.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I expect a lot from the talent that makes up WOTE. This album definitely lives up to my expectations. Fair warning... the songs are very catchy and will stay in your head.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun if you like a challenge and its fun because you get excited about buying things with coins you earn.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story that changed SciFi and raised the bar for what is considered ground breaking SciFi. Notice the technology...familiar today, but nearly unimaginable in its day.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Why hadn't anyone told me how funny this movie is, I laughed until I cried, except for the parts that had me furious, but GOD prevailed, DJANGO was UNCHAINED and OFF the HOOK!
B009AMANBA|4.0|I will admit I only wanted to see this because of Daniel Day Lewis.  As you are watching this movie you are just staring at him thinking of Lincoln and if that is they way he really was. DDL really deserved that Oscar because he is he best thing in the movie. It is a well acted movie by all actors. I did not give it 5 stars because I was little bored throughout the movie and they skipped his death scene.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Love Sean Penn, always satisfies! I was better than I expected for a last minute choice, but it was kinda long.
B005LAIIFS|3.0|In my house we call movies &#34; oncer movies&#34; meaning we can only watch one time and that's it, We this is it. I wanted to like this movie. But could not. Too long too much talk and the characters try to hard. Jack Frost is not likable or interesting. My 8 yr old thought it was good but not good enough to watch again. Want a good one try Arthur Christmas.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I LOVE IT - MUST SEE TV.  i'M A BIG FAN OF KALEY'S.  THINK ALL THE GUYS ARE GREAT, BUT HOWARD CREEPS ME OUT.
B00BRUYQFC|2.0|Other than the suit and tie song, the whole album is filled with strange phrases like &#34;push lover&#34; and &#34;strawberry&#34; something.  This guy's voice is also irritatingly feminine mixed with nerdy.  I would only purchase the suit and tie song and get out of there.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|It plays just like the board game.  So enjoy a game whenever you don't have any physical opponents to play.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|When I heard about this series I was like okay but then when I saw two of my favorite actors as the lead roles I was like I'm so watching this and I haven't missed an episode yet. Wonderful seeing Hannibal before silence of the lambs.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wonderful book, well written, one that will stay with you.  A little upsetting, but thought provoking.  Really a good book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love a good story. John Grisham is among the best. Some good twists and a plot that holds you from beginning to end. I read fiction for pleasure and escape - nothing more - and I wasn't disappointed. Sure, it didn't take long to beginning guessing where things were going but that didn't detract from the overall experience. Another well written book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I could hardly put this book down. I have loved all of his books. I sure hope he is finishing his next book in the series. I too wonder how many there will be. I was not disappointed at all in this book.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I found the kindle edition of mahjong good but I was done with the levels very quickly.  You couldn't move on to another level with this edition.  I endede up ordering mahjong II.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not go to see this movie in the theater, and now I regret that decision. While still somewhat predictable, I was swept away into the storyline and enjoyed the ride the movie provided.
0920668364|5.0|This book speaks completely and beautifully to a Mother's love to her child. I read this and sent a copy to my 33 year old son. It touched us both as I raised him as a single parent. Tears touch my eyes even now....
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i really enjoy this game. it is fun and it really makes the time go by fast. good for your mind.

B00AZRP10M|4.0|I liked the series (and continuations) and this is a satisfactory end to it.  Slightly facile logic and characterisation.  All good stuff however and as I see 75 on the horizon, tempting
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This book is so depressing; that's why I think Americans should read it. We complain about every little annoyance we encounter. Generally, we don't experience anything on the level the Joads, who are the main characters in the novel, experience. Watching as the family carries on with dignity despite the hardship they endure is inspiring and puts into perspective the minor inconveniences of our time.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have read several of these over a period and am currently reading several more or less non-stop on a long holiday in Europe, with my Kindle my only book.  Ilike David Weber's books and his characterisation and dramatic battle scenes although I have no idea if thry are realistic.  I have now read enough of this innumerable series to be getting the hang of the milieu.  The only complaint I have is the difficulty I have in chronology as it is all too easy to read them out of order.  Other authots manage to give their books numbers and I wish david would do so too.  I can't really comment on this specific book as i can't remember it individually!.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|i got this movie cause i kept hearing from my horror movie friends (like me) that it was the scariest movie ever, so i got it and watched it and was like WTF, this in not entywere near scary, its a good movie but not scary, some have there opionons on its stupid but i like it.

B0063M22QO|5.0|one of my favorite games, this one has many, many layout options to pick from ... love that option and the variety
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book but I had heard so many outstanding reviews, I expected a little more. It was interesting and suspensful until I was two-thirds into the book. At that point, important information was revealed and I lost some interest. The book kept me guessing for a good part of the story though.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Felt myself distracted from the story by using stage sets for b.g. Innovative idea, but kept having to adjust and stay with the story.  Conversely, brilliant idea that unfortunately didn't translate to the viewer.  Great cast & excellent direction, however.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the best movies I seen. I'm 73. still love bad boys. I also loved &#34;The Godfather&#34;three-o. We need move good movies
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This book started of quite well. I liked the 4 chapter sample so I decided to pick it up. The book went well for the first half until the reviled the major plot twist. From that point on it was just meh. I felt the story just dragged on and I had trouble making myself finish.<br />And this whole 3 Coda’s thing, I am half way through the 2nd one and it is just more of the same meh feeling I have about the book. I wish I could describe it better but Scalzi has done much better work then this.
B004XZR63M|5.0|A birds eye view into the future if applied. Rich Dad is the epitome of the American ideal, get educated, get busy, then get Rich.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Quite interesting.  Makes you want to have a rainy weekend so you can just sit there all day and have a marathon
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|five stars like to see more apps like this in the future. all will enjoy, a must download for your smart device

0765325950|5.0|Got to say, the Prologue, and &#34;The Last Battle&#34; chapters were the longest I think I have ever read. Awesome Book, Great Ending to An Epic Saga...I just wish there was more to come :( Farwell Robert Jordan and Thank You Brandon Sanderson, I have started to read Brandon's work and he is as wonderful as Robert was, So I really don't need to recommend this book, seen as it's, what, book #14. GREAT!
B005SEZUJE|5.0|shouldn't have ended in only 2 seasons. I love Eliza and her actions. She was great in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and just as good in this .
B00AKFG15S|1.0|I enjoyed the previous 2 of the trilogy and immediately started with the 3rd book. A great story with a dissapointing end, after reading this book I thought that there were pages missing, the worst end to any book that I read and I felt that I waisted my time. Will not recommend this trilogy to anyone because of this book
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have followed Sookie and her world since book one and I have enjoyed the hell out of each and every book. This last one did not disappoint.<br /><br />I would like to thank Charlaine Harris for creating such a wonderful little world.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many time travel stories (even writing my own since 1999). This one is gripping, not so much for the actual idea behind the main plot, but for all of the little details that pull you in and take you along for the ride. Sex, violence, humor, love, intrigue -- this book is full of the stuff of life, including food, music and dancing. Some things are timeless and universal. This story illustrates that exceptionally well. Life is worth living.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use this to place work documents in and well as random recipes, songs lists, etc. I can bring all the information up on my cellphone. I also have it on my lab top computer and my office computer. It allows me to access any information without having to carry around a flash drive.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|I believe it is a good book and is well worth reading. It presents a good concept that really makes you think.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the bible everywhere I go. I love the different versions they offer and the bible verse of the day. I also love the search engine that allows me to easily find main words in the scriptures.
B004LQI0QK|5.0|Well done representation of one of our country's finest warriors in the history of our nation.<br />George C. Scott brought an outstanding, performance and recorded the General as he should have been for future generations to come.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can't help playing this game. It's so addictive. The only trouble I had was figuring out how to exit out of some of the advertisements. Other than that, I would definitely recommend to pass the time.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm not a camera nerd, but when used correctly it makes a considerable improvement in pictures where lighting is less than ideal.  The batteries have lasted a loooooooooong time and the flash works perfectly.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I afraid this product didn't work for me. I tried it multiple times, but ended up uninstalling it. I hope others have better luck!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I was unsure if I would like the new CD because it's become a bit more modern and seemed a little less like the old style of FOB, but it's catchy and great as always.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie is excellent. Great action, good story, nicely done special effects and it doesnt drag or have slow sections. It has been a favorite of ours since it came out and I am glad we got to watch it on prime. One that I have to add to the list so I dont forget to buy it :)
1608871088|5.0|Beautiful art, but I would like it more if it had more jack frost and sophie's skecthes
B004HWYTP4|4.0|An enjoyable movie worth the rental fee. We had already seen the movie in the movie theater, but wanted to see it again before the sequel came out.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It was funny. Didn't like some of the humor. I have watched it more than once. It's the typical thing you see what these type of goofy movies.
B00B2166BS|5.0|As advertised, works great with my Nexxus 10 tablet. It does sometimes come unattached to easy if it is bumped since it is only help to the device by a light magnet.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I found the book to be very enlightening. I am currently doing this diet and am feeling pretty good. The first week is hard but gets easier.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this product. It was of high quality. The movie was clear and crisp and very suspense filled. It was wonderful
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love to play this game. I play as much as I can.<br />easy to play.I would like more bonus coins.<br />I rate this a 5 star game.
B0061XCZ4E|5.0|Alot of great R.E.M. songs on one album. Probably one of their best! This is definitely one to add to your collection.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My 3 year old loved this so much I just had to buy it. Now we have watched  it so much even my husband and u know it word for word. Lol
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love James Bond movies. Action and stories are always excellent. Never miss watching one. I watch then several times.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I would highly recommend getting this book as it is the best personal developement/business book I have read in many years. A must have for any self help junkie.
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|This movie had a lot of good action and a great story. I like Penn and Ryan who is becoming one of my favorite actors.
B008JFUO72|3.0|I'm writing this more as a reaction than an actual review as I believe anyone who saw the first two movies - which was a whole lot of people - will want to see this one no matter what any reviews say. Nonetheless, I will try to avoid giving any plot spoilers.<br /><br />But as someone who was a fan of the Iron Man comics since the character first appeared back in the 60's, I absolutely have to say one thing right out of the gate. In the words of Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons:<br /><br />Worst... Mandarin... ever!<br /><br />Seriously, the best advice I can give anyone planning on seeing Iron Man 3 is that if you remember the arch-villain the Mandarin from the comic books, try to purge your mind of everything you ever knew about him. The character in the movie is _not_ the Mandarin from the comic books, not even remotely, though the film is clearly playing on the fact that unwary fans will think he is. I've heard a number of reasons for the changes to the character, the most believable being that the film's producers didn't want to offend the Chinese (i.e. China), who are a major film market these days and who also now own the largest theater chain in the US. It's essentially the same reason the producers of the remake of Red Dawn changed the villains from being Chinese to being North Korean. So this Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley (but not his fault) isn't remotely Chinese, doesn't have awesome power rings, isn't... Actually, his calling himself 'the Mandarin' just makes no sense whatsoever.  So for those of you who know the comic book character, brace yourselves for disappointment. For those of you who don't know the comic book character, you have no idea how fortunate you are.<br /><br />I have other problems with Iron Man 3. It's uneven, particularly in the first half, shifting back and forth between long tediously slow segments and then suddenly jarring action ones. It has plot holes big enough to shove an oil tanker through and at times requires suspension of disbelief that would take the cables from the Golden Gate Bridge to support. And the use of 3D in the film is distinctly unremarkable.  The characterizations resulting from the script are uneven as well. Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce manage to turn in good performances in spite of the script and the direction.  And Stephanie Szostak gives a stand-out performance as a bad-ass henchwoman.  But most of the other actors are largely wasted, most particularly Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle, but also William Sadler and Miguel Ferrer. To his credit, Ben Kingsley does carry off the Mandarin role that the script calls for. Unfortunately it's one that I want to completely purge from my memory.<br /><br />The blame for the film's shortcomings must be laid at the feet of Shane Black, who both directed and wrote most of the script (Drew Pearce co-wrote and evidently provided most of the humor that appears in the film). Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man films (and who plays Happy Hogan in all three) stepped aside for this one and it shows. It's something of a mystery why Black was picked for this film as his only directorial credit was 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. As a screenwriter he does have 1987's Lethal Weapon to his credit, but his record since then has been decidedly spotty with a string of big-budget films like The Last Boy Scout and The Last Action Hero that didn't catch fire with audiences.<br /><br />But all that said, the movie does pick up steam considerably in the last third and the final battle sequences are, to be honest, fairly awesome.<br /><br />A couple of side notes of things to watch for:  Stan Lee (as always) has a cameo in the film, this time as a beauty pageant judge.  And make sure to watch all the way through the credits as there is an additional scene at the end with a surprise cameo that's worth catching.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the first two movies (but not for fans of the comic book) and for the fairly awesome climactic battle sequences.c battle sequences.
B0097K21YW|3.0|In this level based game, you are Godzilla and bound to destroy a city.<br />To do that, you aim and drag to shoot buildings but NOT as in angry birds which has a backwards slingshot movement.<br />Instead, drag forward at an angle to determine your trajectory (the path of your missile), then release to fire.<br />You have to burn all buildings to the ground.<br />It is sometimes possible to topple over one building which then destroys the next one, too.<br />What I do miss are some instructions and background - once you finish a level, you will be told about fire and collateral damage etc, but have to figure it out for yourself, even though it's not hard:<br />- fire damage: direct hit<br />- collateral damage: damage caused by falling buildings to other buildings<br />- explosive damage: damage to structures when TNT explodes on impact<br />It gets a bit more versatile as you progress, you will have reflecting walls, trampolins and wrecking balls for example.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's hard to earn enough virtual money to upgrade your monster (though it's probably cosmetic) - it seems to take forever.<br />Not a bad game, but I wish for better instructions and a background story.<br /><br />A tip for Kindle users:<br />The Kindle back button obscures the level forward button.<br />Touch to the left of it, then drag to the right until the next locked level set appears, then press level left once.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I have not seen the movie. I really had no idea what the story was about other than the movie previews and a couple of coworkers that saw it and commented on how it really has them reflecting on life. I'm guessing the movie is a little different than the book as I am not reflecting on anything after finishing the book. It was well written and was easy to follow and stay engaged. The basic premise is that there is a ship that sinks and Pi is in the lifeboat with a tiger. I won't go into any more as I hate reading \\"spoilers\\" in reviews.<br /><br />With that said, I would recommend the book, but don't come into it thinking you are going to have a life changing moment from reading it. Just take it as a good book.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well Written, passionate, based on a degree of science.<br />This book points the finger at modern dwarf wheat and not only the impact of Gluten but modern wheat itself as having major detrimental impact on modern health. Having significantly reduce my intake of wheat and seen a corresponding weight loss and increase in energy - but more importantly a reduction in the hunger/eating cycle - I offer this anecdotal evidence to agree with the basic premises of the author, even though I confess I am not 100% wheat free as he argues.<br />The real advantage of this text is that the author does posses scientific training and does coherently appeal to pear review articles to justify his claims.<br />In short this book has a degree of soundness and demands a response from the sellers of modern dwarf wheat.<br />All round a very good book - recommended
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it is really fun to play and I love games that you have to really work at to get through a level. would tell all my friends to start playing
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|I should have known the Wachowski brothers would screw me, but I waged 3 hours and $15 on this movie and was completely disappointed.
0879757027|5.0|The product is just as described. Please read this book. I understand the stoic point of view so I really enjoyed reading Marcus. I will like to follow stoicism. I am so glad my professor made us read this.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|This is an exceptional movie.  Liam Neeson is great as always in his film work.  The quaility of this film is exceptional and even more so, the story line had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it.<br /><br />It was a real treat and great surprise to find this film and what it had to offer.<br /><br />I won't go into details about the film, as I really don't like &#34;spoilers&#34;, but I will tell you, you will love this film and be surprised all the way through it.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|This game was really fun the only thing that I have found to be wrong with it was a lot of repeated words from other like game
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This is another spectacular film.<br /><br />I got it, as it was something new and I hadn't seen it before.  I don't know Bradley Cooper's work that well, but it looked interesting.<br /><br />Was I taken by surprise at the intricate detail of this film and how it works.<br /><br />Wow.  I didn't know what to expect next, all the way through it and was totally caught off guard by the story line.<br /><br />It's exceptional!!  You really will enjoy it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follett knows how to tell a tale so as to keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Just a solid great classic. One for all to read.  Always better to have your nose in a book instead in front of a tv.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I actually read this while travelling in southern India, and know the areas that are referenced in this story.  And, en route home, I saw the movie on my flight back to the US.  I allowed myself to be swept away by the story and was surprised at the ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was very fun but I finished it in one day. I hope the next one is longer and harder especially if I am paying for it.<br /><br />Make it worth my time and money but it was a good start.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I bought this because I was going to be out of country for a while.  this was a marvelous mindless fun trip.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Very good insights into why people act the way they do. I already use it with my clients. Good buy.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|This is a great movie. It's an entertaining story based on real events that everyone can enjoy. It's well worth the rental fee.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy watching The Good Wife together.  A well written and well acted series.  I highly recommend it!

0452273331|1.0|...and that's the fact that she at least predicted the intellectual abilities of her readers by feeling the need to repeat the same things over and over and over and over and then write it on a sledgehammer and hit you over the head with it so that you'd finally get it.<br /><br />I really wonder sometimes if she was just a shameless huckster that was ahead of her time and pre-dated the talk radio era (and now Fox's fake news channel) that would make billions of dollars off of people's stupidity. There's no way that she could believe the psychopathic drivel that she tries to pass of as philosophy, could she?<br /><br />Either way, don't waste your time with this. It's horrendous, just like everything else that she made her money off of. All of her works have done far more harm to humanity as a whole than good as their \\"philosophy\\" (term used as loosely as humanly possible) is \\"GIMME IT, IT'S MINE!\\". Nice cherry on top in this one to write a female character who gets raped and then falls in love with her attacker. Oh Ayn, you're such an old-fashioned romantic.<br /><br />One of the worst books ever. But Atlas Shrugged sadly make this look like Shakespeare. If you want an even bigger train wreck, check that one out.

B0047T70VW|4.0|A convincing and disturbing potential history. I loved the fact you have to work to try and understand what's happening in this world.

B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I was surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did.  It was a little more gruesome than I thought it would be but other than that I thought it was a good movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I started by reading Gone Girl, but I think this book is actually better. It has a richer plot and the characters are well developed. It's a fast pace read that is a real page turner. Great beach book. Just be cautioned it's a little graphic with the crime descriptions.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The big thought I got out of the book is if you build a product or service to be the best, regardless of initial profit and constantly improve it, it will be a success . Never get comfortable.
193700788X|1.0|I'm very disappointed in this book.  The whole thing felt rushed.  It felt like Charlaine Harris couldn't wait to get it finished, and didn't put much thought into anything.  There was no sense of life or excitement in this story, it was, well, dead.  It didn't help that she seemed quite disappointed in herself to have spent so much time writing about Sookie and her adventures (when you read her comments in the beginning, you'll understand).<br /><br />This is a book I will not read again.  I'll revisit Sookie and friends in the previous books, because I did enjoy them, but this one is now and forever OFF the reading list.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I got this for my required summer reading but ended up liking it. I did not expect the story to be good, but it was. If you're looking for a classic, I suggest this one.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The books kept me really eager to read them.  I like a book that helps me relax and go outside of my world!
1595141715|5.0|I bought this book before I went to the beach one summer. I ended up getting sunburned because I read for so long on the beach. When we returned home I wanted to finish it first thing. I found myself crying at midnight over how powerful this book was. I ended up writing a little comment in the back blank pages and then gave it to a few of my friends. They also left comments. Reading over their comments I found that the book also touched them. I definitely recoomend this one.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I've never been a Star Trek fan before and was worried I'd be lost, but this movie was easy to follow along. I enjoyed it.
1594744769|3.0|The book looked interesting so I ordered it. As I've read it, I've found that the pictures are more interesting than the story. The book doesn't hold my attention well. I always end up flipping through the pictures after a few pages. And the fact that the pictures are real makes it even cooler.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME. I LOVE PLAYING IT. KIDS OF ALL AGES WOULD LIKE  PLAYING IT. I WOULD Recommend it to you. TRY It, you will like it.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I enjoyed season 1, and season 2, so far is equally as entertaining. One of the few good shows still on tv. I recommend it.
1400069742|2.0|This is another example of what could have been a good and credible book if it weren't hurt by sloppy fact checking.  For example, on pp. 360 and 371 Senator Nye (a key villian in the book) is identified as representing South Dakota.  He represented North Dakota.  It's this kind of seemingly unimportant but easily checked information that makes a reader wonder what significant facts are also inaccurate.  Please authors, read what you wrote and at least check the simple stuff before you go to print.  Not reliable history.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|Overall, still very funny and entertaining.  2 or 3 episodes were just ok, but I can't imagine having to be funny 100% of the time 24/7 right? A great show though!

A couple days of fasting each week is easy to get through, after the first week. I spread my 600 calories out between lunch and supper. A lot of fish, yogurt, and lettuce have been the staples.

B008BU75IQ|1.0|Trilogy got worse with each book. Very disappointing work from a talented author. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Try prisoner of birth.
0091929784|2.0|I did not like the book.  It seems to promote to a mind set that is not in it for the long haul.  Its target audience is really the millennium generation.
B0062KJ198|4.0|Funny movie, nothing groundbreaking but good laughs. The guy from parks and rec is really funny. i chose this rating cause i liked it
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was able to get his story told his way before he was tragically murdered.  His story is one filled with no apologies for the way he lived his life, just an explanation of what and why.
B003L20IJM|5.0|YES, i recommend this movie..my granddaughter and i watch it all the time. along with the first move. Hoping they make another..
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It really takes you away from this Mad World and for a couple hours, it entertains you!<br /><br />Simple, Fun and Enjoying!<br /><br />Liked all of it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game, it is fairly challenging and a lot of fun.  I recommend it to all.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This is a band that borders on the line between metal and hard rock. This is cool since their lead singer is a chick. You can hear their influences... stone temple pilots, guns n roses, etc. Definitely feel they are an upcoming band. \m/
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The game is more challenging than Angry Birds Free, but a lot of fun to play.  I enjoy it a lot.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I felt the author used too much poetic license with the Jane Austin characters....actually, I felt changing how Austin set up the characters in the first place.  Also, too much of the story was &#34;told&#34; rather than happening.  It felt like all that happened was told by characters rather than played out.  I am a big fan of suspense novels but felt this one was lacking..in fact, I found it rather predictable.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Interesting.  Ended up watching a three episode BBC doc about the vikings at the same time (so now I'm an expert on all things vikings).  Obviously, there are inaccuracies in the show, but I'm not surprised by that.  I couldn't help compare this with shows from HBO, Showtime, etc.  By far the most significant difference between them is the sex.  I just have to say, sex in Vikings is more tastefully done - so no awkward moments of suddenly watching softcore porn with your family members.  I loved it - I wish there were more episodes.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I love this app. My brothers talk at night so I can't sleep! I put earbuds in and turn it on and I'm out like a light. But, if I exit the app it turns off! Also, most things are on a loop!  But besides those flaws this app is great. But it would be nice if you could add more noises. :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful series. The story is in keeping with the best of English drama and the acting is superb.highly recommend it.
1476735115|5.0|Took me a while to buy this book. I was sort of burnt out of those repetitive \\"post apocalyptic\\" movies and books. This book was amazing. I was hooked from the first few pages. Definitely recommended.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I feel that The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful movie. It's the kind of movie that you can watch again and again.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|What ends a person would go to, when in a state of poverty in India, is one theme of this book. Mixed marriage - nationality, and color, love and  desperation for a child makes this an enthralling read.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I would say rent it and not waste money on going to see it, but I wasted money even renting it. Watch when it becomes available for free that way you only waste your time and not both time and money.
B002722R64|4.0|Love the story behind this movie, although at points I feel there couldve been better acting, it was shot in the 90's.
B004WR125O|5.0|Have not experienced any problems with this item. Lost connection alot in the beginning but replaced outdated router and now it works perfectly.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The clone storyline is interesting and well-done, but it's really the cast performances that make this series great. The main actress creates very distinct, enjoyable personalities for each &#34;clone&#34; and the supporting cast is also standout. I rarely &#34;buy&#34; TV, but I definitely make an exception for this series.
B002AS463W|4.0|I guess I just wasn't expecting it to be an early 80's movie, maybe a 90's lol but it is STILL mentioned in Cosmopolitan all the time, to this day! I also haven't watched it beginning-to-end, intently, but it's kind of hard when you're a mom!! But also, who would have thought Mickey Rourke actually used to be kind of sexy when he was younger? Ha ha, but also a weirdo in the movie, if you ask me
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I recommend this alarm clock to everyone who needs an alarm to wake up. It is especially useful when you have a schedule that requires different wake up times. You can name the alarms and individualized them for specific days. Best alarm clock ever. Works very well with my kindle fire HD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, it's one of the best on TV, I think it's because it doesn't get bogged down with to many twists and turns and to many plot lines, it's simple, it's about survival in a world where everything mankind once knew is forever changed. The only thing I don't like but love at the same time is that writers aren't afraid to kill off a main character or two, even though I hated to see them get killed off, it makes the story more realistic and old characters are replaced with new interesting characters, like Michonne. I Hope this show continues for many seasons, or at least until we see the world get back to some form of normalcy.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|saw this version on pbs years ago. went to see la traviata last month at lincoln center terrablestage set music was very good but the dvd version is the best loved it
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Allows viewing of all excel files including .xlsm.  would recommend for that reason alone, but all other applications for word work very well too.
B00821OX98|5.0|First let me just say, I love seeing Noah Wylie on television. He just seems to pick the best projects. I'm a fan! The show itself is awesome! Extremely well-done, fun and exciting the whole time! Great cast, great concept and I watched as much of it as possible in between going to work! Highly recommend.
B005LAII80|5.0|I feel born again hard after watching this movie.  It had the feel of the old school Schwarzenegger and Stalone bone-crushing classics.
B0000667RO|5.0|had all of his really well known songs... i love this cd, listen to it on a regular basis. Was great in concert.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Great kid movie very funny keep you entertain with the whole story line wish I had powers like her and also wish this was a true story
B0083GQVXI|4.0|Based on a book I had not read, but now plan to.  Uniquely sequenced storyline, great performances; the tension that builds is all story and dialogue.  This movie cost only $7 million to make in 2010, garnered a number of awards, but has been a hidden gem.  Contains a perhaps unintended message regarding the issue of public mass-shooting tragedies in this country.  I'm not a gun-buff or NRA member, but this film underscores a key point in a believable manner - at it's core, this is a mental illness issue.  If not with a gun, there are many other ways for a pathological and disconnected individual to destroy lives, as you will see in this movie.  The book upon which the movie is based is fiction, but the story unfolds in a very believable way.  You can see as the seeds of a tragedy are born and develop over many years, within an otherwise &#34;normal&#34; environment.  You see the signs, but could never imagine an outcome such as this.  You place yourself in the role of parent, but rendered powerless to do anything when it's an intelligent, attractive, and often charming child you love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW. I'm a bit floored by this strong first book in the series. I never wanted to read this or even watch the movie on the premiss I thought it was a story about how they made kids compete and kill each other and the dead corpses of those children that didn't make it were then turned into a food source for others. Some of you may laugh by this admission but its true. Just how my mind works I guess. I have a wild imagination. Guess that's why I love to write my own stories. I digress. I couldnt have been more wrong. Anyway after breaking down a few months ago and watching the movie I was hooked. At some point saying I should check out the books before the next movie comes out. Well I was hooked from the first page. It's a real page turner and the writing is solid. We are in Katniss Everdeen's head from day one. And my heart has been ready to jump from my chest ever since. She's brave, so brave and smart. Her solid tactics of survival make her so interesting. The way she see's the world is unique and fierce. And watching her fight for her right to live was amazing.<br /><br />Things I hated, the fact that this story was based on children battling it out to the death in an ever changing arena wroght with dangers with ever step they took. That said, it was a very unique way of telling a story similar to Lord of the Flies in content. At times I couldn't decided if Katniss really liked Peeta or if it was all an act and so it had me feeling sorry for him at times.<br /><br />What I loved: I am a big food connoisseur and the way Katniss described all the different food she ate made even squirrel sound like a delicious entree. Also the descriptions didn't weigh down the story but only helped build this intricate world filled with plastic faces and rough terrain and animals that seemed so imaginative I wonder where the author came up with some of these creatures.<br /><br />Katniss sensibilities in hunting are a major factor in what keeps her alive in addition to her abilityto climb trees and live in them until the Capitol gets involved. Or the Gamemakers I should say. Okay I've said enough. If you haven't read this book I suggest you add it to your reading list. You will not be disappointed. Oh, one more thing. The scenes of death of the kids during the course of the Hunger Games was not as bad as some had said. The details are not so bad as to make one turn away and not read this. At least I didn't think so and I can't watch horror movies because they give me nightmares.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|Seemed to function as described.  I was testing a lot of calendar apps and this wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
044024630X|4.0|Another great Jack Reacher book/story by Lee Child.<br />Reacher keeps you engaged, it is a great read for the Reacher fans!<br /><br />But remember....Tom Cruise... is NOT Jack Reacher.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Here is a man who came to this country broke and ended up a multi millionaire. He is very smart and shrewed. I would be glad to vote for him if he was able to run for higher office. He gets things done and is not afraid of fighting for what he believes in.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like that you earn coins and acorns through game play.  If you are patient you can have a great village without spending real money.  This game plays well on my Kindle Fire and frequent updates keep things fresh and interesting.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Probably considered for it's artistic quality, but I thought it was a difficult movie to watch.  The black and white was over contrasted and it was hard to see the purpose of the movie.  Though, I did watch it to the end and it had a descent ending.
B0000542D2|4.0|GREAT MOVIE, IT BOUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES OF THE 60'S. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO THE FOLKS OVER THAT MAGIC 60 MARK.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This novel is about the \\"Orphan Trains\\" that are a part of American history. It was common from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s for orphaned children to be sent from cities to farming communities. Sometimes the families took the children in as their own, often they were merely \\"farmhands\\".<br /><br />This story follows the life of one of these children, Irish immigrant, Vivian. As she is now aging, she faces her past with the help of a troubled young girl assigned to help the elderly widow.<br /><br />Young Molly is also a foster child and an outsider due to her own heritage. As the pair come together to sort through Vivian's belongings, a bond forms. They have many things in common, due to the lives they have been forced to live.<br /><br />The story moves easily between Vivian's live as a Depression-era orphan, and the life Molly leads as an orphan in today's world. Christina Baker Kline writes a moving story of survival, finding oneself and the power of friendship in unexpected forms.
B006GLN3WY|5.0|These to me were some of the funniest episodes of the show's entire run.  Samantha critiqueing the vibrators in &#34;Critical Condition&#34; always makes me cry with laughter!  True, HBO should have made the price less due to the season being only half as long as the others, but to me, it was the ONE season I had to have on my Kindle.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Funny movie for parents who can relate (I am a parent) but for our friends that are not--they didn't quite find the humor. The story line wasn't that great either. Wouldn't watch again or buy the DVD.
B001F0N0ZG|5.0|I never get tired of watching this one.  It turned out just the way the fans wanted....  I love a happy ending.
0767903862|5.0|I read this book after I visited Australia.  Mr. Bryson did a good job of capturing the reality of life in Australia. I bought this copy for a friend who plans to visit down under one day and while its not your typical travel book, it does a good job of painting a great picture of the Aussies. I have read all of Bill Bryson's other books, he never fails to amaze!
B000QCQ970|5.0|I really enjoy Josh's writing style and read this book after taking his virtual chess academy.  I love the way he mixes philosophy and draws parallels.  Truly an enjoyable and worthwhile read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not initially get past the first 100 pages in the first book of this trilogy however, once I did I was hooked. If you fell for the Edward and Bella love story in Twilight then you will fall equally in live with Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A lot of challenging levels with many new and fun to see actions.  Birds being released from cages is cool.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great the clarity was wonderful I was very happy with my choice . A great movie Tom cruise out does hisself again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, what a plot! Lots of twists and turns. What a couple, I'm glad I'm not married to one of them.
6305622914|5.0|A group of unemployed blue-collar men in industrial northern England, despairing of ever finding a job, hit upon the idea of doing their own version of a Chippendales-type act, but in the &#34;Full Monty&#34; - local slang for &#34;buck naked&#34;. It's clear to the viewer that they don't have a chance (omigod) but a lot of the fun is watching them doggedly pursue their impossible dream. The movie is clearly a &#34;small project&#34; with plenty of weak points, but its good ideas for laughs and tugs-at-the-heart carry it along with ease. I laughed at the characters and I also came to feel very fond of many of them. One caveat: watch a version with English subtitles unless you have an excellent ear for the accents and slang of northern England.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I didn't realize this novel was so short. The movie sure enhanced it. I loved the characters, and I cried as I did in the theater when &#34;cat&#34; disappeared.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|When my son first suggested this series to me I told him I wasn't interested in &#34;stuff&#34; like that.  One episode was all it took.  I am hooked and headed into the fourth season!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie 1st, and was impressed how close it was to the book, although the book gave more detail.  I couldn't put the book down.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This young lady had more tenacity than good sense but persistence is the key and BOY DID SHE HAVE PERSISTENSE!  A really fun movie
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Just not as riveting as the 1st 2 books. Didn't like Prim 's useless death, but like the way she ended the story. Didn't like that the winners had to go back into the &#34;games &#34;.
B000V86OKG|5.0|There are so many twists and turns in this show that I could NEVER tire of the new storylines.  This has got to be the best writing I've seen on a series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|2nd book was almost as good as 1st, and enjoyed it a lot.  Helped to explain the mindset of the different characters.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck is not a great actor but he is a great director and he does a great job with this movie.  Other great actors make up for Ben's flat performance as the hero who gets it right while everyone else either panics or has ulterior motives.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Last Man is just not up to the usual Vince Flynn standards.  Most of his previous books I could not put down.  I am not as engaged with this one.  It is still good but not his best.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Such a good movie,  I love all the old video game references and kiddo loves all the candy racecars.  It's really cute, with a good story.  I know some parents didn't like it, but I didn't find anything too shocking or inappropriate.  People should really screen movies before they show their kids, instead of getting mad about parts their kids see that the parents dislike.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|WHEN I WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE I WAS NOT THRILLED WITH IT, BUT THE CHARACTERS KEPT KEPT DRAWING ME BACK FOR MORE. I NOW WATCH ABOUT 3 OR 4 NEW EPISODES A DAY. VERY ENTERTAINING .
B002SAUCBC|5.0|an unheard of feat, played out by teenage boys, it is merely a walk, but the story delves into the psyche of each kid as the walk progresses. Who will win? A great short read by SK
8866137634|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase because of some of the reviews saying there was no 3-month premium code.  I am happy to report - there was one.  Moleskine evernote notebook is exactly what I expected from Moleskin.
B0037VNX44|5.0|What an interesting man! It's hard to believe this movie is based on a real person! Tom hardy delivers, as always.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an easy way to have your favorite versions available at your finger tips to read or to listen to.  Wonderful!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it works and keeps you very verry intertained between those busy and long days.. in doctors office or in car
B00AW57L96|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I couldn't put it down. The characters were in my head and I was thinking about them, almost as if they were friends. It's about mums at school and mums you know. Well written and a great plot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that the subway surfers is a great game. Everybody should play this game<br />Because it is wonderfully awesome. I hope that everyone gets the chance to play this game
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Ad pop-ups. Disjointed web page. Hard to find links. Videos that have nothing to do with weather. This is a web page full of stuff... and the weather.
B005COO1X6|4.0|A quick read packed with a King punch. A page turner, suspenseful, horrifying, although not as horrifying as the tall grass.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I like the layout of the player better then the one that is already on the Kindle Fire when you get it.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This new cd by Tom Keifer of Cinderella is nice, and is nice to hear it very loud in the night. The songs are very charm and catchy. Give it a try and you wont be wrong!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee gives a courageous true account to what her life was like during the stolen years of captivity.  She also shares her transformation into her new life with her family and those that provided friendship and support.  It is remarkable how she is recovering, the state of mind as to who she was while writing the account and the difference in her state of mind while writing the afterword shows how much progress she is making since captivity.  Read this book...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It solved my Problem and I am very satisfied. i would recommend it to others. it really works well. Thanks!!!
B00BF11STU|1.0|Would a women in the presence of many other high ranking officials really call herself a mf?  This movie shows our people as so course and crass and that is before the torture scenes.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I think its ok but I woud not recommend it  I love myself how about u?&#62; hi jo j o
1452115567|5.0|Love this book!!  Maddie is such a cool dog. The pictures are absolutely beautiful.  It's amazing the things she'll stand on.  It's great to follow her on facebook and to see where she is or where she's going next.  I hope they come back to NC at some point so I can get the book signed and see this sweet pup in person!!
B004LCF9RW|3.0|This movie was in french with spanish subtitles but other than that it was very good.Sylvia Kristel is very beautiful and a great actress.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game with lots of cool scenes. The monkey helper dynamic was cool an unexpected twist. the carnival setting was cool and very colorful.
B001KTATIS|4.0|This movie was ok but a little tame by todays standards.The acting was great and the women very beautiful but the plot was tame.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I have a new MacBook Air, but several older MacBook Pros.  This adapter makes it easy (and convenient) to use the chargers for my older MBPs with my new MacBook Air.  To be honest, for it being an Apple product, I'm shocked it's only $10.  :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I almost couldn't put it down--had to eat tho.  Really riviting. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Never got to see the movie, but heard the book was better anyway.
B001JU4S44|3.0|In the MI series, MI-II is just okay.  Others are better.  Technology within the movie is obviously a bit dated, but it's still okay.
B003O86FMW|4.0|it was good, but #1 and #3 were better.  Maybe I was in a hurry to get to the next book.  But they were all great!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|In my life I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by amazing women and have always been drawn towards helping address issues of gender inequality, both innately and by inspiration from many of those women.<br /><br />In my career now as a Business Coach, the majority of my clients at the current time are women, and they are a constant source of inspiration and learning for me as their Coach.<br /><br />My personal Intention in life is #MakingPotentialPossible. I note this to give some context to my feeling that the two most powerful books I've read this year are The Icarus Deception by Seth Godin and Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg.<br /><br />Both books are (I believe) written from the heart of the author, and come from a place of helping others see the potential that sits within them and giving them thoughts, tools and ideas to help them realise their potential.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all men and women. Sure, there will be some specifics in this and any book that we will not all agree on, but I feel Lean In is, contextually, a hugely important book in terms of moving the conversation forward on what women can seek for themselves (and that men can support them with) in the world we now live in.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Never gave SoA a chance on TV, but decided to start watching it via Amazon Prime, and I'm glad I did!!!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|A long wait for the the final chapter.  Sanderson has done a great job in completing the saga.  The Wheel turns and the Pattern weaves!!
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This movie captures so much of the human experience. This without a doubt makes the top of my favorite movies list.
159562015X|5.0|I bought this book more out of curiosity than anything else.  I had just finished a 360 degree review that gathered input from my supervisors, peers and employees and nothing was positive.  I provided input for others and the way the questions were posed it was clear the exercise was structured to show weakness not strength.  I've been associated with the DoD for over 20 years and the one thing they're good at is telling where you need to improve.<br /><br />This book was one of the best things to happen to my career!  Since the 360 review and taking the survey I've learned a lot about myself, positive and negative.  In an effort to understand my team I bought each of them the book and had them take the survey too!  I combined this book with several others and created a team based leadership program of my own.<br /><br />If you want to know what you tend to be good at than you need to by this book!  Use it and it will help you become a better leader!
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Lame.. Lame..  The script with the Goblin King was like a cheap George Lucas 'cute' make you laugh Grandma lines... STUPID and Cheap.  Effects.. filmography excellent as always.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|My parents absolutely loved the series but when they got to the last show in the season the DVD would NOT play the show.  Big disappointment as it was the season ending show and wrap up for the next season.  Unfortunately, they did not get done watching the DVD until after the return/replace date so they are screwed for the last show.  Unfair that I can't get this replaced for them.  That is why I rated this at three stars instead of five stars.  So if you buy these DVD's you might want to try to start each show on the DVD, long before the return/replace date ends.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|On my wish list for a long time.. for upgrading my favorites to Blu-Ray. Excellent, bold, crisp video, fantastic sound.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Tons of sound and music loops, the ability to mix and save custom soundsets, timer, plays in the background while you play games or read. Also offers binaural beats and simple white noises. Fantastic bargain.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it! The graphics and the puzzles were amazing.  It flowed together flawlessly unlike a lot of puzzle games.  I couldn't put it down until I had completed it so now I am hours behind in my days errands!  Thanks for a great game and looking forward to the next part of the saga!
193700788X|1.0|The entire book doesn't make sense, it's like a big joke. There is no HEA as promised, it's too depressing to read. Charlaine Harris showed how much she really hates her characters. Seriously don't waste your money on this crap.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is inspirational in that it expresses the lengths to which one will go to survive and how character can make the difference.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|michael buble has always since his first album with reprise records, release albums that have tons of hit songs. this definitely isn't one of them for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. the song selections have gone off the \\"buble\\" track, not his usual style<br />2. majority of the songs are unbearable to listen they lack the \\"buble charm\\" that made him a superstar so far<br /><br />advice to potential buyers:<br /><br />1. listen to each song through the preview carefully before deciding on getting the full album<br />2. otherwise, just buy only the songs you really like. you might be saving some money that way<br /><br />of course, this is just my personal opinion. btw, i have just dumped the album aside after listening to the whole album, it will be first and last time i'll be listening to it again.
B001M1ETTO|5.0|In 1984, this album changed my life. I lived in rural Virginia, and the Art of Noise was my first realization that there were musical frontiers to explore outside of what FM radio was pushing at me.<br /><br />Also, this album was out-of-print for a long time. I would not delay buying it as soon as possible.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|The Game keeps turning off will not let you play. My son kept complaining that the app would not work. I have uninstalled the game.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I bought this board to replace an older MSI board that I broke when I removed a peripheral card that broke a capacitor on the old board.  I would've probably replaced it with another MSI board, except that I kept running into various glitches with it as well, so after reading other reviews on it and seeing it on sale one day, I figured I'd try my luck.  Well, I'll say that my luck was fairly good, after a few hiccups at first.<br /><br />I say that because I ran into two issues with it.  The first issue I had turned out to be a problem with some of the memory sticks I had.  I think this may have also been the cause of the problems I experienced with the other MSI board, because after I replaced the memory with some good sticks, I no longer experienced the random crashes I had before.<br /><br />The other issue I ran into had to do with problems with my computer when attempting to go into standby mode.  It seemed that every time I would try to enter that mode, the computer would just wake up immediately, or sometimes it would shut down and not start back up unless I tripped the power switch on the back.  I contacted customer support eventually over this, but they were not too helpful, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  They did offer to RMA the board when they couldn't figure out the issue for me, but didn't end up doing that because what I discovered is that I needed to turn off the setting in Windows' Device Manager that allowed the built-in Realtek network adapter to wake up the computer.  It seems that this is the reason my computer kept waking up from sleep.  After I unchecked that setting, my computer has been able to go to both standby and hibernate modes properly and my computer seems to be rock solid now.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|Robert Spencer's 'Politically Incorrect Guid to Islam, and the Crusades' is much more than a 'dummies' guide book.<br />It is historically accurate, concise, well written with it's critics having to revert to political correctness to refuse it's content.<br />The invented concept of 'Islamophobia' is what is used to demean and minimize the details, the theology and history presented<br />by critics who refuse to allow detailing of said theology and history.<br />In fact, perhaps without realizing it, the author has demonstrated just why, these last ten yrs since it's publication, all critical analysis<br />of Islam, of Islamic history has been vilified, besmirching of those who investigate the actual history of Islam, whether it be the theologic basis of the religion, or it's actual history.<br />I love the simplicity of the text, of it's outline of history; it's frequent references to Islamic sources and how it attempts to engage the reader to pursue the investigation further, thru each chapter of the exposition.<br />The book never insults the reader, though muslim critics will howl at the contents and the implications historically and theologically.  It is well worth the read, and it's frequent references to sources is the call to investigate it's history and conclusions<br />beyond the books own assertions.  A very well done book which is perhaps the finest intro to Islam and history in a very readable<br />format.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am thankful to daily kindle freebies for allowing me to discover this! It's an amazing series and I am so excited to read the rest!<br />I was just thinking yesterday that life couldn't be better: a family I love, spring coming and a good book -- or five-- to look forward to. Very impatient to start on the next!<br />Great content that really makes you think, too. I fear that we are not that far away from this world, at least conceptually. I don't want to say anything to avoid spoiling this for anyone.<br />But Thank you HH!!
1608955702|4.0|Whether you decide to use available light or speedlight illumination for your portrait photography, this book will show you how to improve the lighting of subject(s) by showing you how to analize the light beforehand, (available or flash). Maybe you will find useful to view some of Neil's videos in Youtube and see if you like his style of photography before you pick one of his books. His website is full of free and very useful information as well.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game! I thought the graphics were great, and the storyline was cool.  Just wish the demo went on for longer.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I had read a lot of negative comments about \\"Dead Ever After\\" so I was afraid I was going to hate the book, but I didn't hate it. I stayed up until 4:30 in the morning reading it. I was not happy with parts of it because I enjoyed the Sookie/Eric romance.  In retrospect Ms. Harris had given us lots of hints the romance is doomed and we chose to ignore them.<br /><br />It seems everyone wants to kill Sookie in this book and they develop some complex methods to do so.  It introduces Karin - Eric's other child, brings Steve Newlin, Johan Glassport, and Quinn (my personal favorite) back.  Claude plays a big role in a surprise attempt on Sookie's life.  Arlene's murder is due to her own stupidity and greed. One of the people who provides a clue to who the actual murderers are will shock you.<br /><br />If you are a fan read the book you might not love parts of it but I think you will enjoy it.  In my mind - Freyda falls on a stake, Eric becomes King of Oklahoma, his frequent blood donations keep Sookie young and they live happily ever after.  It is fantasy so I can make up my own HEA!  I will admit this is the only book in this series I did not give a 5 star rating and I think my rating is based on how I feel about the course of Sookie's love life.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|too much bull on this site only go there to stay in touch with family then i see stuff i wish i didnt  but until my family chooses a different way to stay in touch i stuck
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was just plain poorly written and lacked much development or any kind of plausible story line. It seems like all the characters were thrown into the story in some way in this book just to make it seem like all of the \\"loose ends\\" were tied up with each and every character. I was a faithful reader of the series until the last two to three books, where the story seemed lacking in many aspects but I refused to believe that the series would end on the poor footing it has been on during the past few novels-I was wrong. I find it interesting that at the end of the book the entire plot against Sookie was described by none other than Sookie herself as basically really far out there and ridiculous-couldn't have said it better myself. Harris could have done better justice to these characters. I didn't mind the ending itself as some other readers did but I did mind that the main points of the book could have been wrapped up in a short e-mail to the readers that would have probably been far more entertaining than the convoluted crap that the book turned out to be. Sad to see a series that started with such a great original story to end so badly.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've read all the books in this series and love them.  I hate to think that it's over.....wish the series could continue!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My cousin showed me this app and I was like its just like temple run. And then I downloaded it and I forgot all about temple run. In fact I uninstalled it. I love subway surfers soooooooo much!! :):):):):):):):):):)
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The actors, the costumes, the story, the creativity, the suspense and the drama were beyond what I had expected from the series. As each episode concluded, I couldn't wait to watch the next one.  Have been sharing them with family and friends and we all feel the same way.  We are so caught up with the characters and their lives, and are psychoanalyzing  what and why they act the way they do.  The features are entertaining and informative and give behind the scene aspects of people and places.  Love it!!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This may be my favorite book (of this genre) since 'Lord of the Rings'.  Very much looking forward to the rest of the series.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I am so caught up with this series that I can't wait to continue into Season 3.  The drama gets fiercer and the costumes and acting keep me glued to each episode.  I cannot say who my favorite characters are, but Nuckie is definitely the King!  The more evil I see in his personality, the more I love him.  Jimmy and Angela are by far the sweetest and most genuine.  I have seen Mrs. Schroeder act before, but in this, the depth of her talent is truly revealed.  Sending love to Mr. Garrow.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Jeffrey Archer just keeps churning them out and I keep reading them - book three is a real page turner.<br />The thing is if you've read the first two books, you actually get absorbed by the characters in this fast moving series and by the conclusion of book three (which is a cliff-hanger) you can't wait for book four.<br />I'm a big fan.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Disk 2 and 3 are defective. They stop and skip. I tried them on both of our DVD players; neither work.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|This movie is, and always will be a classic!  I never get tired of watching it.  It shows the true meaning of how valuable friendships should be.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|I rented this movie and the only reason i finished watching it is because i wasted 5$ on it. it was soooooo bad holy s***....horrible characters, not funny....annoying dont watch this crap movie
B0040FTKNY|5.0|The characters Dean and Sam (brothers) play well together as they drive across country slaying demons, ghouls and shape shifters.  If you like watching shows and movies that deal with supernatural things....you'd probably enjoy this series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a great book even though it made one feel sad the trauma that this family went through.  Such a sad ending, but mom thought she was doing what was best for them all, perhaps.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite of the Jane Austen books. It starts with a young girl being persuaded away from a marriage and ends with the same girl having grown beyond the persuasive effects of others. The multiple levels of persuasion and influence bring a complexity to this work that some of the other Austen works lack in my opinion. The progression of a character from weak minded to strong minded creates an interesting internal dialogue throughout the work. There are multiple settings in this novel, each seem to work a change upon the character's development; although, some might say that the main character just adapts to the different circles. This main character will remind romantic comedy fans of the scene from Runaway Bride were Julia Robert's character cannot decide what type of eggs she likes best. A worthwhile read.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was a B-24 pilot in the 467th Bomb Group 788th Squadron in Rackheath England during WWII. and could really appreciate the story.
0307010856|4.0|Always liked this book as a child; therefore, I wanted to get this book for my child.  The &#34;Golden Book&#34; quality is fine, but the pages of the book were off from the cover (miscut?).  Other from that, it is a must for the shelf.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|very well done, worth it to watch it. Prime cast and prime history picture. Tarantino style tragedy and fun. 10
B004TI5N38|5.0|Always enjoy Ba;dacci and have read his books for years.  His story lines are fiction and yet based on events of our present day.  Leaves the reader thinking about how this may happen in today's world.
B004SBX112|5.0|Love it. Very additive. I have grandkids that love it too. They sit with me and tell me how to play.
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I had heard all this great feedback, so I was really looking forward to it. HOWEVER, I could not make it through the first episode! Really think that I just could not get in to the actors....might give it another go....not sure!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|The book is very concise and some tips are very useful. However it is more of the surface rather than dive in about people relationship. Overall, there are some guidance but limited.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Great Series, I would like to see it revived. I do like Scott Bakula from his pervious work on Quantum Leap.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series. The second season is just as exciting as the first. I could not stop watching it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app for when you plan your day or your week. Highly recommend it. cant tell you how many times I've caught without enough sweaters
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love to play this game. Periodically, it works too slowly, but I think that is the network not the game.
B0090SI460|5.0|I loved everything about this movie created by absolute geniuses.  The characters are funny and delightful. Best experience about this movie, however, is the behind-the-scenes look at how the characters were created and developed, how the creators solved technical problems with graphics, how they invented ways accomplish what their imaginations demanded. We also get a behind-the-scenes peek at the creative team at work; this is informative and inspiring for young people viewing the film and possibly considering careers in this field.
B003JUGQ38|2.0|GREAT SHOW but be careful before watching on Amazon as the final 3 episodes are not listed and no where do they indicate that it wasn't a full season.  Had my daughter not been a fan of the show I would never have known.  I have to wonder now if I saw everything in the first 3 seasons???????
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I cant get it to work right now and Its my favorite game. What do I do?<br />Please tell me.
0066620996|5.0|This book was used for graduate class.  this is a great read and looks at the concept of good vs great.  that in business good can be the enemy of great by believing that if a company is doing well then it is good enough.  The problem is that is not sustainable.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't wait for the next episode of the show each time that I watch one.  Very high quality and I love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ana and Christian are the epitome of the perfect couple. This is a great love story with sex thrown in.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is so fun. I've been on it for the last few days straight. The strategies are numerous depending on your play style. You a turtle? Storm walker? Balanced? You can do it all!
B003M70O5O|5.0|The writing and the acting are superb in this show. Watch it and give it a chance and you won't be disappointed.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|So I started watching this strictly for being a big JJ Abrams fan. I have not been disappointed yet. It has an off the wall House feel. I hope the rest of the seasons continue strong!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Navagating the screen is a little different because on a mobile phone there arent two screen like there are for the Nintendo DS systems - none the less, i enjoy playing it and my kids do too. Go Maxwell GO!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Not bad little slow at first but has gotten much much better. Looking forward to I hope a new season
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|A collection of classic actors. Really funny, the kind of humor that has you remember the lines.  the mystery has you guessing to the end.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I saw this app on the google play app store and when i visited the website and saw the option to purchase from amazon I decided to buy from here. Big mistake. Amazon tacks on a sales tax to it, making it more expensive... whereas had I purchased from google play no such tax is added. I have purchased other apps from Google play and never had a sales tax tacked on.<br /><br />If I had seen a sales tax would be added I would not have purchased it. But when you download the amazon app app for your android phone and sign into your amazon account it just makes the purchase without showing you exactly what you're paying. Only afterwards you see it. So my advice you wanna buy an app, just buy from the google play app store. Except you wanna throw away extra money.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I already have it on DVD but the online streaming is so much easier than loading a DVD, I have duplicated several DVD purchases because of the simplicity of streaming
B009R659L8|5.0|This has been a book you can not put down. Great great reading. If you haven't read it, do so.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have been a fan of the series since the first book. I was so excited to download this book on my kindle and read it. After reading I really wish I did not spend the $12.99 for this book, it is not worth it at all. The book was very boring. Normally with this series I don't want to put the book down and I have to finish it the night I start it. This book actually put me to sleep. I feel Charlene Harris has given up on her charaters in this book and is bored with the series. This book was written just to give the story an ending. Lets just hope with as crazy and far from the book the show True Blood has gone, it can at least give us a real and unboring end to the series when the time comes since the author has really let all of us fans down.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was absolutely GREAT!!!!  Ick! That we have to wait a whole year for part two!!!!!  I found this really followed the book.  The scenery was really spectacular in many places.
B000784WMW|3.0|I wish there were sub-titles since the accents were a bit thick for the uninitiated. Kept reasonably close to the story line.
B002NZK5RI|5.0|This has a great storyline and great actors too!  As I said the 'killer' was very scary and this gave me the creeps and somewhat gruesome too.  But overall it was good - kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.  It never let me down once through the entire movie.
1401923127|5.0|Another fine book that supports me on the road to understanding a bit more about how the universe works on my way to freedom. Thank you Bruce LIpton
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I'm so glad I got this.  The acting/singing was just awesome by all of the actors.  This was well produced and presented.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I love the &#34;Oldies&#34; and Sir Paul does them to perfection. He is so smooth. If you like Rod Stewart's latest cds, this one is right up your alley.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Really LONG but a wonderful movie that touched more on the family life/personal side of Abe. This was well presented.
B008602KQI|5.0|Classic &#34;good triumphs over evil&#34; tale presented in an entertaining way with just the right amount of suspense and mystery. Excellent character casting. One of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time.
B0097K21YW|1.0|Why would this cute/stupid game need to access the network? Oh... for in-game purchases! What?! I already paid you for the game? Why should I have give you more money to play?
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|It's okay. It's an entertaining look into people's lives, but there is not much action. I am not disappointed I watched it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A beautiful story of young love. I enjoyed the unexpected twists and look forward to future books. It does have some dark elements, so not for the faint of heart.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Super collection of all of VM's hits - my other CD's got scratched over time and this collection is a great replacment for them (with bonus tracks).  Worth every penny!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The continuation of the second season does not get trite or old.  The plot keeps moving, with a few surprises, while maintaining the characters and their relationships.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Boring game, there are others more interesting pass the time games out there.  Thanks all the same, just not for me
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I love Bones! I read some other books about Bones that my mother had and just fell in love. I'm glad you can just pick up a book without it really being in order. My only wish is that the kindle edition was a little cheaper.
0547366205|5.0|What a GREAT book. I love everything about it. The baby hasn't arrived yet and I find myself picking it up. I love the rhyming and the ending was purfect.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You must start with season one to truly appreciate this series.  This prompts for too many words....lol.  Fun to watch.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|You will get a charge out of this book especially if you are familiar with Manhattan. Reacher takes on a female opponent and has to solve a puzzle. This is a great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw my brother playing the game so I downloaded it and let me tell you, it's so worth it
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I can't believe how up to date (seemingly current) Holmes' methods of detection are.<br />I love the references to things that were current at the time of publication, like performances<br />at the Royal Opera (De Rezske's singing in Les Hueguenots)<br /><br />Especially relevant now that I am watching Elementary on TV - the TV show keeps the names Conan Doyle used: Mrs. Hudson, Irene Adler and others.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great book. Watching the HBO series definitely helpful. Follows almost exactly. The characters have substance and you will find yourself loathing and rooting for all of them. Hoping to finish the series of books this Summer.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Versatile and very easy to use. I only wish timers didn't start as soon as you set a new timer, but that is a minor point
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was eskeptic to buy one more time....another LEd zeppelin VHS/DVD/bluray....A little tired of the old game of a new remaster, redigitalization, etc...but, let me tell U  that this was totally out of expectancies. The sound is incredible, the drum is amazing (even when Boham Father is not playing). The only thing...is one that we can expect...Robert Plant's voice is not the same that we knew 30 years ago...but, nobody is like 30 years ago... :) Enjoy the cd and blu ray...are amazing!!
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I like this show and enjoy it.  It is definitely not one of those that i watch for hours on end in eager anticipation of the next episode.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can check the weather for where I live, where I am traveling to, and check the extended forcast.<br />I can have my favorite cities to check what the weather is where family/friends live.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|I tried to get into this when it was airing and couldn't.  Tried again because of all the high praise but it is just not for me.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I love this series being one of the original trekkies. Quality was perfect. Will keep me an Amazon Prime member for sure!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|If you are looking for that grand vision to companion \\"Close to the Edge\\" then your 30 year wait is over. As a single track \\"Fly from here\\" was dropped from the 1980 album although it was preformed in concert. For thirty years the musical theme mellowed and developed until it became this album. Less loud, more nuanced and still as visionary as the band was all those years ago. This is Yes at its best once again.
B00001U0E1|5.0|A great cast makes this take on Shakespeare's life fascinating and fun to watch. Details showing the conditions of London during that time and the difference in the condition of the classes in Elizabethan England add to the enjoyment of the film.
B00280LYHS|4.0|A lot of questions FINALLY answered. The story and final battle really started to drag at the end. I think Mr. Riordan didn't want it to end as much as the reader.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is intended to be a children's film, but I thouroughly enjoyed it.  Colin Firth doing slapstick comedy as the father of 7 children is hilarious. Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee is excellent and the children are great.
B0079ZWGVU|1.0|Very rarely happens, but I just quit from reading this nonsense at half way through. It claims to be noir but it just pieces of fragmented sentences piled up on each other with no storyline, no plot, no distinguishable characters.
0811874192|5.0|I ordered two of these as gifts for dear friends.  They are lovely and I am so proud to give them.  Love pop-up books.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|The series is the best ever and stayed up most of the night watching almost all at once.<br />Just couldn't turn it off.
0634022296|3.0|Hi there...I just wish that this book was bigger and with the spiro ring so it will be easy to out on a music stand, if they print the same book on that format in a letter size, I will buy one today. But this is very difficult to read and to maintain fully open....and I think they forgot the song &#34;Anna&#34; unless I am blind. Three stars only and is too much
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show so much! Because it's no longer available On Demand or Hulu, I had to buy it here but it's worth it.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I really like this Windows client a lot. It works really well and has excellent performance.<br /><br />The one area where this client falls short of the competition (at least for me) is the ability to choose screens in a multiple monitor environment. I have two screens setup on my PC. If I have an active RDP session on my second screen (eg. connected to my work environment), when I make the Jump Desktop connection to my PC it focuses to the second screen (which has no task bar to spawn other windows or access other apps running on my PC). What is also frustrating is when the work RDP session is in full screen mode the &#34;floating window bar&#34; is not visible in the Jump Desktop session. So I can't minimize or close the work RDP session on my PC. The only work around I have found for this situation is to send a Ctrl-Alt-Del, and open task manager. At that point I can see the PC's task bar from the primary screen and I can select/open/close applications at will.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Splashtop RDP client has an option to select screens for multiple monitor environments and then this isn't a problem. If Jump Desktop could incorporate something like that, then I would easily give it 5 stars.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I thought it was one of the best movies I&#34;ve seen in a very long time. I thought it wasvery exciting all the way through.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|One of the better Tom Cruse movie's put out, the story line kept you thinking all the time.......... A must see!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book and a must read for every married couple.  It teaches you how to love in a love language that is received and that fills the love tank.
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this flick! The various scenes will having you laughing loudly. Be warned that the movie has English sub-titles, so be prepared to get you speed-reading skills warmed up and ready.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm 25 and many of my friends read this book when they were in middle or high school, but I never did.  I decided to check it out and I really enjoyed it now as an adult.  It had some interesting themes and ideas, which were still unique despite all of the sci fi works that have been made since this was written. I enjoyed that this author provided detail, but not too much so that I still had freedom to use my own imagination.  This was a fun quick read and I plan to move on to the rest of the books in the series.
B009E9R2OK|3.0|There just isn't much said here that's worth while in any of these reviews. I'm not the least bit interested in the two other discs. I only want the Blu Ray disc. Nothing more.<br /><br /> You guys totally missed the important stuff. You all said pretty much the same things. What I wanted to hear is if the Blu Ray disc gives us DTS HD Master Audio lossless Sound. This is the most important thing to me. I get it that the video isn't recorded well.  I am an Audiophile. Please stop regurgitating the same thing on 97 different pages! Not one of you went so far as to mention the audio format. IMHO, the quality of the surround sound is most important. I also want to know who  the surround sound Engineer was. Get it?
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is great, I used to record it when it first aired. One of the few shows ny husband and i both agree on. Watch it! You'll be hooked too!
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|I have not been able to get into any other books since reading this series.<br />All others seem bland in comparison.<br />Katniss is one kick ass chick.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you have ever played a cut the rope game, you know what to expect, except this time around, you have two hungry om nome to feed with two seperate candies, the regular om non, and an om non from a different part of the world, and a different time period. It is great fun and well worth the 99¢
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a Good game just don't spend too much and you should use boosters they help out a lot...action is good and as u level game becomes more fun then u hit the u must buy  buy buy to survive spend dollar after dollar not really worth it all!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following is a dark twisted psychological thriller. Sometimes the violence is a bit gratuitous, but the play between the main characters is fascinating. I often find myself shocked at what happens. Not for anyone under 16.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|I uninstalled it due to none use.  I don't travel enough to use this.  Should've considered that first.  Oh well.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I liked it well enough although it was predictable and a little long. I would definitely recommend reading The Secret Keeper written by the same author. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable read.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I was not disappointed. Interesting, well written, very educational!<br />Highly recommend this book as it applies to every<br />aspect of life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the book. Really beautiful story with just truly wonderful and amazing characters. This book made me feel many many different emotions. I laughed, I cried and just had a really good time with this book
B0043JDUNS|4.0|I really liked it and if you enjoyed the first movie, this is a nice continuation of the story. Renting it is a good way to see it.
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I found this book a real chore to read. Same ideas discussed over and over in the same way. Also, there is no need to berate and belittle  those who hold a contrary position to your own as Dawkins does. By the way, I am not &#34;a person of faith&#34;.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am officially addicted. Watch episode after episode. Already looking forward to next season.  I love the Characters and the drama.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is the best! You need to know how to make or bake anything it is all on here!!'
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Works flawlessly as advertised. Makes a huge difference in sound quality even when connected to an iPhone. Works even better when used with fiio docking system.
1932100660|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone.  The science in it is described for a lay person, so it's not a difficult read for non-scientists.  Some may be put off reading this book, which provides evidence as to why a whole foods plant based diet is a good choice, but they would be missing out.  Keep in mind that T. Colin Campbell and Dr Esselstyn both grew up on farms and ate very differently to how they do now, due to their research and clinical trials.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This may be common knowledge but Ben Kingsley is incredible in this role. Not only is this film wonderfully entertaining, it is also educational. I learned a great deal about S Africa and India and Pakistan. It doesn't seem possible but I believe this film just might do justice to the life of the incredible man.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Various family members already play this game, and it gives me a connect with them on a different level. I play this game regularly with my wife and one of our sons, and some time with other family members.
B0094K1K42|5.0|I don't understand why some reviewers felt that the movie made them feel bad. True, this isn't a fairy tale with a trivial feel-good happy ending, but it is more original than that. It has a number of really interesting moments. Charlize is captivating. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Henry VIII, 6 Wives, Countless Kingly romps in the sack, what more can you want? lol.<br />Beautifully done, costuming stunning. Looks fantastic on my KIndle Fire HD 8.9.
B0006J28BO|4.0|The movie worked great except that it skipped and froze momentarily for one part of the movie.  Other than that it worked fine throughout the rest.  Just get a DVD cleaner from your local Walmart and it will clean the mess up.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun if you want to play for a little while but it does freeze up often. I'm not into the team playing but at least now its not required to in order to complete levels.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Lots of fun...just like the first one! Seems to go by really fast though. New characters are cute too. Can't put it down
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I'm all about good endings. This movie was pretty good and had good action but the ending was just flat.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I really like Robert Carlyle in this.  It's a fresh take on an old series.  Sorry to see it didn't last longer.
B00B8PMWJI|5.0|okay this is weird sick and nasty but some how good I watch it 2 times so far it lot of stories in different languages with English sub
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Well done and action packed. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend. My 12 year old son watched more that once, so worth the purchase price right there.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I have been of fan of the boondock saints ever since i found out about the first movie. This sequel is just what is needed. It has more violence, more gunfights and lets face it, the woman who plays the FBI special agent helping them out in this sequel is just drop dead gorgeous and the southern accent adds to it.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|The dvd was exactly as advertised. good product, very pleased with my purchase. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a copy of this movie.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Enjoyed the storytelling and the complexities of the magical system.  The misfit band or protagonists against the cruel overlord was a plot that I haven't already read time and again, but didn't stop me from becoming engrossed in their world and having a good time.
1439130833|1.0|This looks like the book and was listed under books, but it is a calendar.  I didn't read the product description but the placement and marketing is extremely deceptive and misrepresenting.
0345529057|5.0|Not only were these books in great condition, I received very great customer service from this seller. I had inadvertently had the books shipped to an old address, so I had contacted them regarding this issue. Since the old address was no longer existing, the package was sent back to the seller and they re-shipped it to my current address at no additional cost. That was awesome because I had been looking forward to reading these books for a while and couldn't wait to get them in the mail. Thanks for your great customer service and prompt response!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I bought the complete series and am enjoying wending my way through them all.  It's a joy for this 61 year old to look back and see all those stars from the period showing up on Columbo.  Seeing how youthful and beautiful they were and how they look now helps me age a little more gracefully...  And of course, dear Lt. Columbo - watching his mind at work and his talent for annoying people into giving themselves away...it's a real delight to watch the 'cat-and-mouse' act unfold!  And we don't need a lot of blood and gore to be entertained!  I sorely miss that with today's programming!  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH COLUMBO!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I really love this game but you can crash in to a lot of stuff so that slows you down boo
B008133MDK|4.0|I would give it a 5 star rating but I didn't care for all the nudity in one of the episodes.  That aside, Benedict and Martin's version of Holmes and Watson are just amazing and thoroughly enjoyable to watch!  And the music is just perfect!!!  I loved both seasons and wish with all my heart that there would be more!  Any chance of that happening...?
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|It was a great read. I am now reading the &#34;prequel.&#34; The Family Corleone. It's also a must read if you're interested in the greatest fiction mafia family of all time.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This book was recommended to my by my doctor and a reference to increase my education of vegitarian diet and nutrition.  It does increase your knowledge if your considering a change in your diet and it broadens your choices.
B00C8ULNVK|5.0|It's gets better with time. This is the best album Carlos Vives give to us. I love every lyric, rithym, and emotion put it it... really deep into the heart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This wasn't exactly the direction I expected the book to go in. However, I was extremely pleased with the ending. I was glued to this book the same way I was to the first two. A definite must read!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Couldn't get into the book, thought it was hard to follow. Although maybe that's since I took such long breaks between reading. Nothin like the HP, so if up didn't like that maybe you'll be interested in this, but to me it wasn't even the same writing style.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It really makes you think about God and how vast our Universe really is and how what we think becomes who we are.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|Normally sequels don't out perform the originals no offense to Vin Diesel but State of the Union with Cube as XXX Perfect script, cast, direction. Wilem Dafoe as the bad guy and Peter Strauss as the President no contest
B009NY43NY|1.0|I started readinf this series when True Blood became a TV show. And I was quickly hooked to the series after page 1. Like the rest of the fans, I have been dreading the final book (because there would be no more books to follow) and at the same time really looking forward to seeing how C.H. closed the whole series out.<br /><br />***spoilers ahead***<br /><br />I agree I had an inkling while reading Dead Locked that C.H. was going to put Sam and Sookie together. Something that makes no sense what-so-ever. Part of the charm of this series was that Sam and Sookie were friends, who hadn't gone there. It was dependable. to be honest I didn't have a problem if she didn't end with Eric. While I love the character my favorite guy was always Quinn, and I was always sad that C.H. didn't let that relationship get further. And how she ended up having him meet someone, for them to abandon him, and he is just going to stay with her anyways... What a crap ending for that character.<br /><br />I agree with many other people who stated this book was not even written in the same format as the other books. I don't mind if a book jumps from 1st or 3rd person point of views, as long as it makes sense to the story. But the p.o.v flips didn't enhance the story. they were confusing at best, but mostly they were just pointless.<br /><br />And yes C.H. in this final book, re-wrote all of her charatchers. Bill who has loved Sookie since book 1 and has been trying to get back forever, making constant comments on how he loves her, and he hopes she would turn to him again one day etc, acts like an indifferent freind in this book. Eric, too, who is even described as being full of life is whiny and soft in this book. It makes no sense that he gave up sookie after everything he did to get her. And even Pam was distant and off kilter in this book. She who pratically forced eric to tell sookie about the marriage in the first place, acts like she doesn't care at all in this book. And the addition ofKaren was just weird. there should have been an explanation for that one.<br /><br />Amelia and Sookie who were so close,and lived together all that time. And now Sookie writes her off? Because she talked with her Dad? Sookie never even said she had the dor to ameila just asked if knew what one was. And she's ticked that Amelia mentioned it to someone else and feels all betrayed? Really?<br /><br />It just feels like someone else wrote this book, or that C.H. just didn't care how this was written or ended. She took no notice of the history of her own series, and established relationships and charachters. Bringing in all these people to try and kill sookie? Way to farfetched, and rushed, and....just stupid.<br /><br />I did read a review where someone said that you wouldn't cheer for this version of Sookie much less read a series about her, and I have to agree. She was whiny, and judgemental, and harsh, and mostly just infair to everyone. And for a women who hurt till the last book about Bill's lie, then she should have been devastated with Eric. It can't be that he's a vampire. So is bill. it can't be that he deosn't want her because he did. C.H. spends most of the series getting Sookie with Eric. He wants her from Book 1 on, and sookie is with him longer then anyone, and then it just ends, with barely an notice. In such an offhand way, and Sam is all of sudden it. It was just dumb. And I reall, really wish that she hadn't done it. Even though my favorite is Quinn, after all the books before this Eric was the only logical choice for Sookie to be with.<br /><br />Ugh, i can't even write a coherant review, becuase I'm so confused and disappointed in this book. I'm sure we all know that book coming out in the fall will tell us what happened to all the charachters, and all I can say is I hope that book is more satisfying. However if it states that sam and sookie live happily ever after, and have babies etc..I'l barf, and I still won't believe it happened.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Jude Law's project is outstanding script, cast, direction, etc... a great family film a must for your library plenty of action a modern classic
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Couldn't keep up with what was going on, or who ate who. Really wasn't my &#34;cup of tea&#34; I hope this was'nt true for everyone.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|A modern classic where you can watch over and over plenty of action there is graphic violence but with parental supervision it can be a great family film glad to have this in my library
1601251505|5.0|Was worth buying this book because of the abundance of information found in it. If I had any question I was easily able to find the answers. I suggest This book for all players of D&D pathfinder addition.
B00008EYA5|5.0|One of the ultimate action movies they molded the original with the modern version and just to show how amazing the movie was when original cast members made cameos definitely the cherry on top R. I. P. original Jim Street Robert Urich we miss u. The cast, direction, etc... were all outstanding a great family movie u definitely need this one
B0091REZMW|5.0|I first played this on Facebook. I was so happy to find the app for it on my kindle fire. I love playing this thanks.
B007SGM084|5.0|The novel keeps one interested.The writing is simple and easy. Exciting! spellbing! Mystifing! Full of intrigue into  a<br /> different world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've been waiting a whole year to get this game, and finally got it! It is very addicting and fun. It has good graphics and other great stuff. 5 stars!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The series speaks for itself. And thanks to Sanderson we got an ending. This was awesome and it didn't feel like coddling. It was a great ending to a great bunch of books
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|A fresh take on the Peter Pan story. Good cast. Children would enjoy it. Good family movie. Maggie Smith is great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy this so much....I love the grandeur of the ladies and gentlemen of that error in time....when things were proper and language was clean.  My daughter got me hooked on this show and I reallly enjoy it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Excellent show that is very well acted, extremely well written, and has a great deal of humor and suspense and setting.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I have never ordered a video this way, but it was so simple.  Loved the moved.  Will be a frequent user of this service.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I like the animations and the various categories that you can choose from. It is a very good game and very fun to play.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started my career back in the days when 12 baud modems were considered fast.  I used to keep my notes on paper and spiral notebooks.  Then the company I worked for at the time sent me to Franklin-Covey for time-management and I used my Franklin-Covey for YEARS.  But I found myself using my laptop more and more in the last 10years or so and my use of Franklin was less and less.  Then I ran across some software called Debrief.  This allowed me to move all my note taking to the laptop and be able to retrieve information with a few mouse clicks.  Life was good.<br /><br />But in the last few years I began to find Debrief lacking.  I needed something to allow me to access my &#34;offline memory&#34; from different systems.  I needed something that would allow me to paste graphics.  To be able to set up tags.  Answer:  Evernote!<br /><br />I use the free version and I have yet to come close to approaching the 60mb monthly limit.  And I use it pretty heavily.  I can access my notes from any of my devices, laptops, Kindle Fire, phone, and any system in the house--physical and virtual.<br /><br />Best of all, anything entered from anyone site or device is automatically synced up with all the others.  One of the few pieces of &#34;cloud software&#34; that is truly remarkable.
0316286443|4.0|I liked the book. The step by step instruction missed steps sometimes, but I'm glad I got it. Learning a lot with this book, however it kept me wanting more. His technique is simple and I absolutely LOVE the face to face section & the wonderful guessing game I play with people in the dimensions section.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I never watched any of the other<br />Stargate franchise shows, so I had nothing<br />to compare it to. I like it, but have to be<br />truthful, I'm watching it because of Robert<br />Carlyle.  But that said, it is a quality show<br />that relies heavily on character studies, rather<br />than action.  It's intellectual scifi.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Extremely well done film about the real work of Santa, the Easter bunny, the tooth fairy, the sand man, and Jack Frost.  I liked that the characters are very real in human reactions and feelings. The bogey-man was appropriately villainous and the plot had depth.  Hugh Jackman was a terrific bunny!
1451648537|5.0|What a strange bird this guy was. You have to read it to believe it. This is down to the nitty gritty....things you don't ever hear about when you hear the name Jobs.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Watched with my husband and parents. Everyone loved it. Hilarious, light, feel good movie. This movie is for everyone! Highly recommend!
B0000028UK|4.0|I received this item in good condition. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was posted. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this is an awesome game! Ot is so fun and addicting! I cant stop playing it!! You should reallyvget it!
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I am a fan of The XX and have pointed other folks to them in full appreciation for their sound, consistency and ability to deliver the goods.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Clever and diabolical. Gillian Flynn is a very talented writer and since I enjoyed this novel so much I immediately ordered her previous book.
B00192IOBA|5.0|Jason Mraz is not only a unique composer, singer and musician but he is a great story-teller as evident in this album. Like a high-end suit, the artist name on the cover sells itself.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|I played football on the field, in  the film. I went to high school in Texas playing football. This film brought back memories of Hell Week. After hell week, I would really have to nurse my body.
B005R32L66|4.0|I am in a long distance relationship...Skype has be a useful tool in helping us feel conneected and secure in our relationship. When we get sick of just talking on the phone its nice to see a face and smile! If you are not really familar with video chatting as I was not...It was amazing and almost sci-fi - the advances in technology have made it so that people never have to be apart or feel diconnect from loved ones. At first it was kind of awkward to get the hang of do you stare in the persons eyes or just talk like normal??? skype is so much fun!! The only downfall is the occasional blurry picture and it is kind of hard and diffcult to identify contacts and/or browse the &#34;find people&#34; feature. but all in all - GREAT!!!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Watched it with the wifey, her first, my second...great movie.  Action packed with conversation starter story lines.  Glad I purchased it to watch again.
B001HC8516|3.0|It's a funny and refreshing point of view about men and the way they think. Its from the male prosepctive with the just the right amount of female &#34;girlfriend I feel ya'&#34; kind of input- it has hints of that playful converstional tone that women like- it's cute. but It's kind of repeatative--so, great tip (just 1) which is basically- get over the jerk, He's Just Not that In To YOU!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a nice book.  Lovely descriptions of rural Ireland alternate with sad descriptions of the title character's childhood in an orphanage.  Soon you find yourself rooting for him, hoping that he will find happiness in his life as an adult.<br />After his adoptive parents are both dead, he finds himself alone and lonely.  A neighbor suggests that he look for a suitable woman in the lonely hearts column.  That is where all the fun begins!  You will find yourself laughing at the hilarious scenes that ensue.  But will he find a woman?  Read this book to see what happens...
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have been buying two or three episodes of this season every day or so, and I eat my lunch as I watch them. Of course, this series is one of the most amusing comedies on TV today. It is the perfect series for downloading piecemeal and enjoying it the way I have chosen to do, in my Video library.
B0091LS07E|5.0|The following is the review of Girl on Fire I started writing when I bought the CD when it was first released but later decided not to complete and post:<br /><br />Thing is, I'm not at all disappointed by this album and for me that in itself is a rather morose state of affairs. Because everything seems to fall into a mid range contemporary sound no real stretching that I sensed with Diary or my personal favorite Unplugged. At first blush, none of these tunes grab you or bring you to the edge of your seat. It seems with each new release my immediate reaction is indifference and only after immersing myself in the songs do I progressively begin to acquire passing appreciation of some of the tracks.<br /><br />Starting with As I Am, in my opinion the CDs have lacked the range and vitality that initially made her such an exciting artist. At this point, my purchases are a rote activity absent any confidence a preponderance of the songs will be impressive. From where I sit, most of the cuts here could be interchanged with a host of other female vocalists, as though there is trepidation or an unwillingness to stretch beyond the hordes...<br /><br />THEN I went to see Alicia in concert on the Girl on Fire tour:<br /><br />She rocked the place, integrating these new tunes with a blend of favorites - dare I say classics - from the early albums and now I cannot honestly state there is one track that fails to bring a smile to my face.  Even before, I had positive feelings about the torch song vibe of Brand New Me, the old Motown energy of Tears Always Win and unsurprisingly, that new bedroom standard the Fire We Make, but now even the uptempo Beyonce style When It's All Over are drive time essentials including that Bollywood exile, Limitedless.<br /><br />Yes, I just might be a fanboi.<br /><br />I'm okay with it...
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Amazing how much of the story they fitted into this movie. This whole is greater than he sum of its parts. This movie even inspired my sister about the whole yarn, and she is not and never has been particularly a fan.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|As a scientist trained in enzymology and microbiology, my research has never extended into nutrition or diet. This book, in many ways a written summary of Dr. Mosley's televised program on BBC-UK and PBS-USA (plus recipes), outlines a way of eating by which one can indeed lose weight, namely by reducing calorie intake via appropriate meal sizing and scheduling. I've read scientific articles and can generally follow them, and Mosley's supporting data as well as the method itself, both resonated with me. My spouse and I decided to pursue it.<br />After less than a month of intermittent fasting, we've each lost nearly 10 pounds. As an added benefit, I hope soon to leave behind the 'pre-diabetes' meds I've been taking for the past year. And if things go as Mosley suggests they might, there could be other benefits as well. We're not doing this for the life-extension possibilities, though we are nearing 60 and the first crop of grandkids is on the way. Our hope rather, is that the lives we live are healthy ones.<br />Of course, not every diet is for or works for everyone, but this approach's simplicity and advantages (flexible scheduling, eating what you want on days when calories are NOT restricted, adjusting accordingly once a weight goal is achieved) add to its overall appeal.<br />If you were lucky enough to catch Mosley's televised presentation, you might find the book superfluous.<br />I like it as a reference backup, and as something I can share with others going forward.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well it's amazing. because you can kill zombies much easier. if your just starting  this wuold be a great starter. because it much easier to craft.but there one problem theirs boundary on it.it's not just for kids adultes can play to.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Wonderfully done.  I loved this so much.  It is now one of my favorite movies!  The Blue Ray is fabulous.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love the new game, seamless and inventive, and SUCH cute little monsters!! You won't be disappointed with this new version!
1416955070|2.0|I'm sad to say I had high hopes for this book that weren't met. After this series was hyped so much I expected something stunning, but the characters were flat and the action was never very exciting. Way too much explanation in the book, to the point of it feeling extremely unnatural. I stopped reading at page 120. I liked the humour in the dialogues, but that wasn't enough to keep reading. I bought the paperback as a second-hand so I brought it back to the charity shop I got it from in the first place. Maybe someone else will like it better!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Once again no disappointment fro Jeffery Archer. This is another page turner and keeps you waiting for the next book.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|I love the soundtrack! The only thing I would have liked to have done differently is have the dwarves song go longer, such as in the book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This one is hard to put down-so many twists & turns in the plot.  I very much enjoyed the novel!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I just don't like the limited attaching way. Also I don't trust the scow in the back!<br />Also I'd like to sea a cover for the mics on top if I'm not using them.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I downloaded it mainly for my 3 year old.  Neither of us found it interesting for more than about 3 minutes.  If you know someone else who has it, then use theirs and say your money.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The characters were well developed.  I had heard about the orphan trains but this is the first time I've been exposed to the reality.
B0091LS07E|3.0|Was very disappointed to hear rap (Nikki Minaj) on the song Girl on Fire.  Had never heard her on the radio and do not care for this version of the song. Otherwise love Alicia Keys.
B0080K3G4O|3.0|While the book has some moments of insight, it seemed, at other times, to try to hard to show how schools of positive thinking and optimism are not helpful to achieve happiness.
B000HZEE64|5.0|Loved how modern issues come up in movies. The acting is superb and well worth the price. Some of the other actors I recognise from other movie but do not know their names off hand. The cast is an enjoyable young cast that blends well on screen.
1451626657|5.0|So far I'm really diggin the book a lot of big words sometimes get stumbled but still really good, it has me laughing really hard but that's just me what I find funny and what other people find funny are two different things, for sure a book to get
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Smart, well-written and well-acted. Love the story line and Johnny lee Miller and Lucy Lui have excellent chemistry. Makes the show fun to watch.
B005O64VH8|2.0|I love Secret Garden and was very happy to see something I've not yet gotten my hands on yet.  This album is really not their best work at all.  It sounds like they threw something together really quick.  It sounds way over processed and does not share that dark achingly beautiful sounds like in Once in a Red Moon and Songs from a Secret Garden.  I was really disappointing.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci writes a tight thriller.  This was one of many I have read by this author.  Follow this story with &#34;The Hit&#34;.
0060594888|5.0|Anyone starting network marketing this book is a must! It warns of the ups and downs of that you will face. It gives you lots of information to help motivate you and tells you how to help to deal with problems we all face! It's a must have for all of us in net work marketing.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A great show that rides the line of reality and known truth. Dr. Walter Bishop's Jekyll and Hyde life has many interesting turn of events. He's also hilarious.
1576754227|5.0|This book helps in your personel life and also with your network marketing business! It will help anyone that needs a bootty boot! Gets right down to business. Anyone that reads this book will see something of their self in it!

B009D72ZBS|5.0|Very good book. All I can say is that I couldn't put it down once I started reading it, and Im not much of a reader.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I cant put this book down! There isnt a dull moment! Great read no matter what your age, highly recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|Althought it is repetitive, it is soooo addicting.  Once I start playing it I find it hard to stop, so I try to only play when I have a lot of free time on my hands.
B002A9THA8|5.0|Loved it  very emotional  beautiful ending I am a big fan of hers and she didn't disappoint  maybe I'll watch it again.<br />Thanks.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|the one thing I don't like about it is the text part.You can only write in the middle of the picture,not to the side or sideways<br />like other photo shops.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I just love Tom Cruise! I loved the character he played, he just totally matched the part!! As always I love the action in his movies!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I waited a long time for this.  I began reading it and the writing was much better than the last one. I did not like the way it turned out though. It is like it went flat.  I will be interested in the follow up book.  I hope that it changes.  I am a big advocate of Sookie and Eric.  Sam to me is just settling.  That is just my opinion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good way to not only challenge your mind, but all of your friends as well.  I have always loved this challenge.  now it is convenient
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Of course at 68 years old, Rod (or anyone for that matter) can't quite get back to his best work of a lifetime ago, that of the early '70's. More than 40 years now.. It's hard to believe!<br /><br />What he's done here on most of these songs is pen wonderful reflections about his life while focusing on all types of life's relationships. His children in \\"Pure Love\\" (a beautiful track), his dad in \\"Can't Stop Me Now\\", a particular son in \\"Live the Life\\" (vintage Rod), a teenage sweetheart in \\"Brighton Beach\\" and on it goes...<br /><br />You can sense something in this album that has been missing from his work of the past few decades and that is a desire to write something real, meaningful and perhaps lasting.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed most of his stuff from the recent past but something about this one brings me back. Enjoy!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was the first version of Les Miserables I ever saw (saw it on PBS) - I love the way it was presented, and the performance is very good!  I highly recommend this 25th anniversary edition!  Alfie Boe was wonderful!!!
B00B19DW0E|5.0|If you want nuanced, clever and heartwarming, look somewhere else.  If you want to see Kurt Russel and Isaac Hayes ham it up in one of the glorious John Carpenter films that helped define an era of filmmaking, stay tuned.  A good, no Great bad movie.
B00417HV14|4.0|I liked the venue and the group. For me there is so much bass the band gets lost in the noise. The talent is there but the right mood is required to enjoy. Joe never misses so I will always enjoy watching his performances.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Wonderful story line, one of a kind, it held ones interest and made me feel a part of the story, Very descriptive  Was so hard to put down, I laughed and cried as the story unfolded .
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Favorite movie of all time! Watch it every Christmas! It never gets old, and always find something new in it!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I gave one star bc I have never seen the movie and I can't give a higher review without seeing the movie! So sorry! I did not give  start bc it's a bad movie!
B00006AFF5|5.0|One of the must see movies at Christmas! Glad I've got it in my collection now, have to watch it every Christmas!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|My Sony SR-11 Handycam works fine with this Opteka X-Grip, and can even allow for the cam screen to open to the left when this grip is also to the left.  The fittings top male and bottom female threaded adapters work OK to allow for a microphone or light that would not otherwise work with the Sony Handycam provided proprietary mount.  The large flat bottom of the grip is good for setting down on a table.  Lightweight and it does flex, but do not expect it to last thru a war, just gentle use.  OK for 20 bucks.  Just do not buy the Opteka VM-8 microphone to go with it.
078322737X|5.0|One of my husbands favorite movies, so I bought it for him as an gift and he loves it! 8)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Okay, I bought the book because the book is always better than the movie, right? And I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. Only I haven't seen the movie yet. I'll get there, one day lol
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Dark Side of The Moon is probably one of Pink Floyd's best releases if not there best it was great to hear it live. Considering I was to young to see the band when the album was released and there's very little chance of any at all that they will ever reform now that Richard Wright has passed away. That would be just as bad as the Beach Boys who continue to tour with out the Wilson Bros and call them selves The Beach Boys.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|i do not like this game at all.  i love the angry bird games that i've purchased a lot better.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It was a great read, you had to do a lot of back and forth, but worth it.  I was sad when it ended.  Will look for other books by Kate Morton.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|love the timing. keeps me wanting to score a higher total.  i do like it a lot.<br />would recommend it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great series!  Fresh new approach to a story that continues to please. Too bad it only last for two seasons.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|did not like this game not challenging enough.  I like games that keep me interested.  would not recommend this game.
B0060D10I2|5.0|The soundtrack is stellar.  The acting superb.  The cinematography is ingenious.  The plot ebbs & flows quickly and naturally and brings you to a heart-warming conclusion without so much as a yawn.  Costuming, CGI, makeup, and set pieces all mix so well.  A true piece of ART from Tim Burton and company!  I can watch it over and over again and continually be entertained and surprised(always picking up on something new)
B00CBKLO52|4.0|This app provides a decent simulation of the RC flying experience.  I'm using it to refresh some skills before the real RC flying season gets underway again.  Clearly not equal to the $200+ commercial RC simulators but on the KFire it's a credible practice tool.  It's hard to maintain contextual reference to the ground and landing area but that does not seem uncommon when &#34;flying&#34; while only looking through the small &#34;window&#34; of the tablet or screen on any simulator.
0747274231|5.0|I wasn't planning on writing this but they trick you with a simple email where it like all youneed to do is give it a rating but once you do it makes you enter a title and at least 20 words about the book. In the right mood I could go on and on about AG but now is not the time and I am rather annoyed by the underhandedness of these emails. So, in the future I need too remember this so I can avoid it. Great book though.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|When I'd read the 1st 25% of the book, I checked the website to see if I'd downloaded the wrong book. No... it was the book I wanted, but I was still puzzled. It was the correct title, but did not seem to be the book that all 5 Star reviewers had read. This book was terrible. It went nowhere and took forever to do it. There were twice as many flashbacks of Jamie's childhood as we're needed. There were whole episodes of Jamie's adult life that had no bearing at all on the story and could have been cut out. Lydia's chapters were not any better. And to add insult to injury, the whole story was written in a ridiculous, colloquial style that would raise the ire of any person born and raised on the Emerald Isle.<br /><br />But, I persevered and read on. Hundreds of reviewers had given this book 5 stars and raved about it. I could only assume that in the next chapter it would begin to develop into the fabulous book it was purported to be. And then I thought... ok, the next chapter, and then the next and the next. I finally had to admit that I'd been hoodwinked. It was never going to get better and it never did. And the title that I'd found so intriguing turned out to be based on an inconsequential remark made by one the more insipid characters. It really has nothing to do with the story.<br />The whole 300 page book could have been reduced to a short story and it would still have been boring.<br />I not only won't be misremembering it, I'll be forgetting all about it. Another waste of a month's library choice. From now on, I will first get a sample of any book I download!
0792156684|5.0|who does not like a love story, even when it doesn't have a great ending.  I would have loved to walk on that ship before it sailed just to see for myself how great it was inside.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Very creative.  Scenes I will never forget.  Puzzles I will never solve.  Could it really happen?  Faith is required.  A must-see.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I had to get all 5 dvd's of this movie, you can make a movie night with all 5 terminators and a big bowl of pop corn
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Following this series on HBO, it has become a favorite due to the time period in which it takes place. I love the clothing and the settings of Atlantic City in that decade.
1558908846|5.0|but its one of my favorites. love the guy, stallone.  and this helps me rebuild all my movies i had on vhs
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This series is extremely entertaining for its action and comedy! When one ends and your not pressed for time, the next one goes right into the Blu-Ray player.
0780622650|5.0|I use to watch the tv show when I was growing up, I loved it then and I love it now.  I wish they had made a movie of them finally getting to where they were going.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Allan, the 100 year old man in this story is not happy at his retirement home and leaves. Through folly, timing, and luck Allan makes his way through encounters with characters of good and bad intent always coming out ahead of the game also the manhunt on for him. Allan has a suitcase full of money that he aquired by chance and soon becomes the focal point of several aquaintences.<br /><br />Almost like a second book we also read about Allan from his youth to old age and his chance encounters with people of historical significance and how in some cases Allan changes modern history.<br /><br />I loved the movie Forrest Gump and loved this book very much also as they seem to relate quite well! Lots of smiles and good  humour throughout!<br /><br />Highly recommend this book!

B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am so glad Charlaine finished the series the way she did. She remained true to herself and Sookie! I love the surprise at the end, at least for me it was. I would have never guessed it was that person creating havoc in her life! Well done!
0439023491|5.0|Have not given this to my daughter yet for her birthday, but she loves everything about the Hungry Games.  Hope she likes it

B000FC146C|3.0|I choose a three star rating more out of respect for the literary aspect of the book. It was, in my opinion, very well written.
