B008G8SFGO|1.0|KISS died when they released \\"Unmasked\\" in 1980, and with due to the cowardice on the part of Gene and Paul with \\"The Elder\\" (1981) the band was done and buried as soon as Ace was thrown out. The removal of the makeup, the constant revolving door of band members as fast and as disposable as the groupies they met on the road, were only desperate gasps for air for a corporate machine that was on its last legs - and should have been given it a dignified death. The mid 90's reunion tours with Ace and Peter were only feeble and pitiful parodies of a band that once was Great. For when the same songs from the 1970s are repeated over and over in every concert, in every tour, it can only mean that the material from any post classic-KISS lineup absolutely stinks and is not accepted by the fans. What is even more obscene is the amount of money earned by the 4 original members but was unfairly distributed against the 2 goys. This album, whose content is subpar to even 1980s releases, is the work of a parody band whose bag of good ideas has been empty for quite some time now. No amount of studio trickery and over-amplified guitar sounds can mask the emptiness that lies beneath this pathetic album. I borrowed it from my local library as I did not want to risk enriching the SS duo any further. And after 2 listens - one in the car, the second in my home stereo - from end to end, I can definitely conclude the clown makeup should come off as well as the 2 hired hands pretending to be part of a band whose dues they never paid. I entered this album already biased against the band, but did listen to it twice to search for a hook, some thing that would neutralize the bias, but found only additional fuel with which to condemn this piece of garbage. If you must have this album, download it for free or copy it from your local library. Let's not fuel Gene Simmons' ego anymore, shall we?
B00A50PE6K|3.0|I really enjoyed Glee Christmas 1, and LOVED Glee Christmas 2, so I was so looking forward to #3.  What a dissapointment.  There are no original songs.  Lea Michele has ONE song. Very obvioulsly missing is Matthew Morrison, he has a beautiful voice!.  Glee Christmas #3 just does not have the playful vibe of #1 and #2.  One of the best songs is Unique's version of Joy to the World. That track will end up added to a Christmas playlist but the rest will be soon forgotten.  And I'm sorry - but Finn's strength is not in his voice.
1451620829|4.0|Like many KISS fans of different calibers (some prefer KISS Classic: 1974-1981, others prefer later re-incarnations of KISS masked and unmasked 1982-present), I read both of Gene's books, Ace's book, a book written by a groupie (\\"Into The Void\\"), and finally Peter's book. Considering that Paul Stanley, frontman, co-founder, co-writer of the band's greatest songs, and lead singer, is a very private person, I am not holding my breath to read his version of KISS history anytime soon. Without taking sides - though I've always had a soft spot for Peter and Ace - there is no doubt at all that Gene Simmons' over the top and abrasive personality, as well as Paul's backstabbing and neurotic manners, drove the Spaceman and the Catman over the edge. Ace and Peter were already damaged goods when they joined KISS, but by watching Gene on various shows and interviews, as well as Ace and Peter's accounts - one can see that Gene's ambition was driven by a mentally abnormal need for sex and money, even at the cost of the band's musical credibility and cohesiveness. Those of you who have read the books, I do not need to go into further details. And had there been a firm hand in the band's management - a larger than life Brian Epstein - to keep the boys in harmony, many heartbreaks could have been prevented. Like poor to low middle class Joes who suddenly find themselves rich and famous beyond their wildest fantasies and with nightly Roman style orgies to boot, even the managers and executives were caught by surprise at the success and profit of the band, leading them all to excess in everything. This lead to poor choices in music, finances, and significant other issues. Of all the band members, Peter appears to be the most honest and accepting of his own faults. Time and time again when left alone Ace and Peter would either hit the bottle, the needle or snort to wipe their troubles away. Peter's honest accounts is miles away from Gene's self-serving output and unwillingness to admitor regret any unfair act on his part. For him, using sex, hoarding money and mistreating everyone around him, including his partner of 26 years is excusable by repeating the story of how his mother survived a Nazi concentration camp and how his father left them ( a fact debatable if you watched the TV show - his mother kept a lot of things from him for decades ). Peter started off life with many disadvantages, made the best choices available to him at that time, and failed at 2 marriages - losing his money, job, sanity, and years of sacrifice. However, the fact that he fought to escape the clutches of drug addiction with the help of his friends and wife, as well as the love and recognition he receives from KISS fans all over the world, makes him a rich man compared to the closeted and insane backstabbing personality and mistreatment at the hands of Paul Stanley, the appalling greed of Gene Simmons - both men who desperately (like Donald Trump) want to appear to be as normal and successful (with no help from anyone but themselves), and the unfortunate stupidity and betrayal of Ace Frehley - which shows how low people will go in the quest for the almighty buck. Peter Criss has Gigi, who stuck by him and helped him up unlike the California q'un't he married. Gigi married a low self esteem, sick man, and was able to turn him around and was there when he needed someone. Gene, for all of his glory and billions in the bank, is nothing but a pauper compared to Peter. Peter may have lost his millions, but he fought his inner demons to rise fro his ashes. Gene's absolute insecurity in denial, is only kept that way because like a drug addict, he needs his millions and the adulation that follows. And because Peter has gotten up to fight one more round every time, he is loved and respected by millions of KISS fans - the type of love and respect Gene and Paul will never have. And that makes Mr. Peter Criss a very rich man.

0062183591|4.0|I read Dr. Ariely's \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves\\" as a student in Carlow University's Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics [...] course 'Forensic Research and Analysis'. For it being a required reading, I found the book very engaging and easy to read. Even as Ariely describes his various experiments and the findings that resulted from them - something that I'd usually consider, for lack of a better word, boring - he uses common situations, every day language, and even humor to make it interesting and easy to understand for every reader. Ariely's theories on the \\"fudge factor\\", what makes us cheat, and even ways to prevent it from happening are some of the more profound theories I've read. I would highly recommend this book to not only those in the fraud investigation realm, but for anyone looking for a good, scientifically backed read.<br /><br />The only critique I would have for the book is that some of the experiments seemed to loosely follow what we have come to define as \\"scientific research\\". I felt that some of the experiments contained a little bias. Almost as if he selected people that would produce the result he was looking for, such as college students cheating on a quiz that would be unchecked by the instructor and result in money for every question they got right. I would have liked to see him use a variety of people and situations to try to produce the same result.<br /><br />As I continue in the MFF program and onto a career as a fraud investigator, I will never forget this book and what it's taught me. It's opened my mind further to the complicated question of what makes people lie and I look forward to using it alongside my other education to solidify the work of my career. Thank you for your research Dr. Ariely.

B00004R76H|2.0|The DVD I received did not play in any of our DVD players, even though it claims to be formatted for all regions. I did get it to play on our computer, but it is Linux based. I do not know if it will play with Microsoft. The music is good, of course, but the formatting is unacceptable.This DVD was purchased through an independent amazon seller, so I would suggest that anyone wanting to view their DVD go directly through amazon and no one else. I have been having a lot of problems with DVDs ordered from other countries, as well. I was not aware that different DVDs use different formatting, so I'm trying to save everyone else a headache with this warning.
B000066SBB|5.0|WOW, what a wonderful collection showcasing the only true Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. This collection is as another reviewer posted \\"essential\\", and without a doubt \\"the best you will find\\". Warner Spec.Mkt. UK has done a fine job producing, and digitally re-mastering these great songs that span almost 40 years. Bring back some fond memories, make new ones, listen, dance to, and enjoy both her golden oldies, and newer songs. Fortunately for us Aretha was, and still is living in our time, yet another thing to be really grateful about. Don't you dare miss getting this CD or you'll be singing the blues...

044024630X|2.0|Child must be a genius.  How else could he make the dumbest plot ever written hold your interest for more than a few pages?<br /><br />Here's the plot: there is a hick town in the South next to a military base, where a hotshot captain is stationed.  The town seems to have a population of about 50 people, but three of them are stunningly beautiful young women.  And all three have an affair with the hotshot captain, and all three are murdered shortly after the affair ends.<br /><br />And the sheriff, also a stunningly beautiful woman (and who has been celibate for years, but falls into bed with Our Hero a couple days after meeting him), is completely stumped.  She has no suspects.  She doesn't know where to begin, and misses the most obvious clues, like someone's head half cut off, with no blood on her clothes, and no spray.<br /><br />Spoilers from here on.<br /><br />There's a clever twist at the end.  Anyone who's ever read a mystery would know that the captain could not possibly be the killer, because in spite of the retarded sheriff, he would be the first person anyone would suspect.  But the twist is, he actually is the killer.  Not only that, but he kills local women wherever he happens to be stationed, including Kosovo.  His men all admire the way he always nails the hottest women, and don't seem to notice that they all end up dead.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.  His father, the chairman of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, has a clever plan to cover up his son's guilt.  He arranges to have the US Marine Corps create phony personnel records, because that could be easily be done without arousing any suspicion.  And just to make sure that nobody will investigate further, the phony records implicate the aforementioned local sheriff.  I mean, how better to quash an investigation than by forcing the chief investigator to prove her own innocence?<br /><br />And there's still more.  The army wants to keep a lid on things, so they restrict the soldiers to the base.  But some Pentagon colonel thinks that's not good enough -- he wants to make sure there is ABSOLUTELY no further trouble.  So he arranges to have any civilian who goes anywhere near the base shot, and their corpses just left outside the fence to be found.  That should quiet things down, especially when one of the victims is the 16-year old brother of one of the murdered women.<br /><br />Fortunately for the Army, Reacher is on the job.  He despises anyone who kills people and then covers it up with a false account, so he kills everyone involved in the coverup, and then covers it up with a false account.  Of course, then he has to leave the army, because he's tainted.<br /><br />Remember kids, killing innocent young women all over the world, no taint; you'll probably be a general before you're 40, and the Marine Corps will help you cover it up.  Solving those murders, huge taint; your career is over.  Hit the road.<br /><br />With no sarcasm at all, I can truly say this is one of Child's best Reacher novels.
B002H3EUAE|4.0|This would be a 5-star if the mug was full-size so one could use it.  Additionally, the tin arrived dented on the side near the bottom, so impossible to pop out.  I purchased for a birthday gift, and don't have time to return and wait for a replacement.  The seller waited until the last possible minute to actually ship the item so it arrived on the last day of estimated delivery.  Shipping was disappointing for such a small package.  Amazon is usually much faster.

0307341577|2.0|I saw many 5 starts for this book and thought the synopsis sounded promising. The book has so much detail ( that is disturbing and disgusting) that it takes away from the story. I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Trilogy and was at first disgusted by the sexual acts in the books, but found them to be apart of the story and not the whole story. This book, however, creates shock value by describing in vivid detail the sexuality of every character- and serves no purpose. I am only half way through the book and I want to just stop reading, but I really want to \\"solve\\" the mystery. My advice to you is, if you don't want to read a novel with a lot of cursing and sexuality- don't buy this novel.

B004A8ZWW4|2.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />  'Real Steel' is based on the 1956 Richard Matheson short story, 'Steel', which was later made into a Twilight Zone episode starring Lee Marvin. You might recall in the Twilight Zone episode, Marvin gets into the ring with a robot opponent after boxing has been outlawed in the future. 'Reel Steal' doesn't aspire to such tragic heights: here, the robots are merely controlled by their human handlers at ringside with WiFi-like control boxes.<br /><br />  What 'Real Steel' does have is a solid plot. The New York Times may be correct in assessing that it is a \\"well wrought out entertainment\\". On the other hand, it's basically geared toward the pre-adolescent market with a very predictable storyline.<br /><br />  My problem with the film are its principal characters. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, the former boxer turned robot trainer/manager who is pretty much a caricature of a dumb, impulsive, child-like man who's solely driven by material concerns. This is a role that probably would have been better played by a young Mel Gibson in his heyday. Here, Jackman tries hard but fails to make an unlikeable character, likable.<br /><br />  Kenyon is unsympathetic from the get-go--welshing on a bet with the sleazy promoter, Ricky, and then skipping town. The dark moment of Real Steel's second act, when Ricky and his goons beat up Kenyon for failing to pay up on the bet, is indicative of why we're unable to root for Kenyon, even after two thirds of the story is complete. Even Kenyon can hardly protest, as the beat down appears not to be completely unjustified.<br /><br />  And then there's little Max (Dakota Goyo), who Charlie accepts $100,000 for from the boy's wealthy aunt and uncle, in exchange for full parental custody. The precocious Max, for my tastes, appears to be a little too aggressive and confident for a preteen, and the sight of a father and son, interacting on just about the same level of maturity, comes off as more comical than realistic.<br /><br />  The strength of 'Reel Steel' lies in the escalating tension of the fight scenes. The robots themselves (most of them anyway), seem to be modeled on 'Transformers'; but Atom, Max's 'bot', rescued from a junkyard, is more a cross between the steely intelligence of a humanoid Robocop and cuddly Spielberg extraterrestrial.<br /><br />  Perhaps the best of the fight scenes occur early on. In the opening scene, Kenyon's obsolete robot, 'Ambush', lives up to his name, when he's slaughtered by a real-life bull at a rural fair. Using the money he obtains from giving up custody of Max, Charlie purchases 'Noisy Boy', a secondhand 'World Robot Boxing League' (WRB) Japanese model, who also ends up as a pile of junk, while being roundly destroyed by Midas, the illegal circuit champion.<br /><br />  After the discovery of the discarded 'Atom', an obsolete 'second generation' sparring bot, Max and Charlie try their luck in an unsanctioned outdoor meet, featuring a crowd of unsavory boxing enthusiasts who look like extras from a Mad Max movie. The spiked hair trainer with a robot called 'Metro', steals the show, as he attempts to take down Atom with great panache, but ultimately ends up having his own robot destroyed in the process.<br /><br />  A montage follows with the media soon promoting Atom as the people's champion. With his growing fame, Max and Charlie obtain a legally WRB sanctioned fight with 'Twin Cities', a double headed robot, who Atom easily knocks out. This gives Max the opportunity to get up in the ring and challenge Farra Lemkkova and Tak Moshido, the Russian mogul owner and Japanese computer genius trainer, of the intimidating world champion, Zeus.<br /><br />  SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD: To the writer's credit, the underdog Atom, does not defeat the physically superior Zeus. True to form, the world champion retains his title, winning on points. Still, Max and Charlie can take comfort that Atom isnow the 'people's champion', and he was able to stand toe to toe with the champ.<br /><br />  In the end, 'Real Steel' proves to be a real mixed bag. You have a great deal of variety in the various fight venues and a clever mix of actors in giant robot suits doing their thing, coupled with some excellent Avatar-like effects. But the overwhelmingly predictable tale of loser father redeemed along with an in-your-face, overenthusiastic pre-teen boxing enthusiast peddling his win-at-any-cost unwholesome wares, tends to turn this somewhat compelling narrative into a less than successful 'B' picture as opposed to a high-level, sci-fi fantasy entertainment.now the 'people's champion', and he was able to stand toe to toe with the champ.<br /><br />  In the end, 'Real Steel' proves to be a real mixed bag.

B007THA4FI|5.0|I love the way Ms. Rowling creates believable and compelling characters. This is not a fantasy England but a gritty struggle made very apparent by the haves and have nots. It is England and it is Kentucky and most everywhere where the lines of class and wealth are drawn not only in which side of town, what county, etc. that people live in but what they perceive their options and dreams are. There is a sadness to Casual Vacancy. I have just heard that the BBC is making a series of the book, hope it makes it's way here.

B0063GORYU|5.0|my favorite solitare game of all time. I play this to unwind at the end of a busy work day.  Takes a little more concentration and strategy than regular solitare.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I bought this based on many great reviews (professional and word of mouth from friends). This album is a MUST buy! I noticed lots of influence from other artists in Mr. Clark's music--Lenny Kravitz, Hendrix, the Stylistics, etc. I really enjoyed it and suggested those close to me to buy it!
B0091QSNEE|4.0|My granddaughter has enjoyed playing this game. Easy to follow, but could stand to be a little more challenging.  I would recommend for 4-5 year olds.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Great Item!  I am very happy with this purchase!!  Great Item!  I am very happy with this purchase!!  Great Item!  I am very happy with this purchase!!
159420411X|5.0|Overall this is a very decent book, well written, well researched and most importantly, practical.<br />Why? because the author introduces Bayes's theorem, which has always been hard for me to understand how one would apply it in real life, and he has done a superb job in giving lively examples that are easy to understand and practical to use.<br />The chapters on Poker, earthquakes, weather forecasts, economics and political polls, terrorist attacks, diseases and global warming are very informative and interesting.<br /><br />For further application of Bayes's theorem for investors, please read Stalking the Black Swan which explicitly introduces the same concept of how it is applied to incorporate new information for analyzing stocks, though the explanations are more confusing if you don't get the concept first.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Gracias por la venta. Es la mejor película de todas, considerando que me gustan varias. La venta fue un éxito, justo lo que decía en detalles y en el tiempo que lo esperaba.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not what I expected but the whole series is weaved with surprises. Cannot wait for the second movie!! I am sure it will be as great as the first.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I really like this group. The music is very inspiring. I would definately recommend this for people that like Irish music.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is an amazing writer, and I love his books! Looking forward to reading the next installment in his series!
B000060MMI|5.0|Great buy if you love Irish and punk music. I love the songs Swagger and Druken Lullabies. I would recommend this cd.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I had fairly low expectations for this movie but I must say they did a really great job with the action scenes in this movie. The story is pretty interesting as well. Suprisingly they used alot of cgi in this film and slow motion fight scenes sorta like the Matrix. Really fun to watch. I normally never rewatch a movie, but I've already seen this one twice. Great buy.
B0000D96NW|5.0|After being really disappointed with 2001's 'Supercharger' and somewhat disappointed with 1998's 'The Burning Red' when I heard that MH released a new album in 2003, I was a bit hesitant to buy it, but after reading reviews that they had returned to form on it, I immedietly went out and bought it, I couldn't wait to hear it since I was a big fan of 'Burn my Eyes' and 'The More Things Change', when I popped it in, and 'Imperium' kicked in, I knew the band I loved before was back, gone was all the nu-metal tinges that dominated the prior 2 albums, back was the slow, heavy chugging riffs, the harsh vocals, the catchy leads that MH were always known for, but there is something different with this album that was not evident on the first 2, the clean vocal sections, and to be honest, I think it makes the album a better listen, with more versatility, this song is totally awesome, from the angry lyrics, to the heavy songwriting, and basically, if you like 'Imperium' the rest of the album pretty much follows it's path, there's not a bad song on here, some are better than other obviously, but theres no filler, and they don't all sound the same, which I like.<br /><br />Favorite tracks, 'Imperium' 'Bite The Bullet' 'Elegy' 'In The Presence of My Enemies' 'Days Turn Blue To Grey' 'Vim' 'Seasons Wither' and 'Descend the Shades of Night'<br /><br />So yes, Machine Head definetly made up for the prior lack luster albums with this one, and would get even better on their next album which is 2007's 'The Blackening' which could easily be their best album, yes even surpassing the mighty 'Burn My Eyes' so if you like this album, you absolutely need to check that album out, if you don't mind long epic songs, you will love it, Machine Head is back, and better, I said it, this new era is the best they've ever done, even the newest one 'Unto The Locusts' is killer, pretty much a continuation of 'The Blackening', so you might as well get both.<br /><br />Rock on \m/
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I like to watch animated films for some reason, and the storyline on this totally suprised me. Well played Disney, well played. Was a really good movie, great for kids and adults.
5551369242|5.0|i only wanted to read one of these stories, but had to buy the collection.  I'm happy to have bought it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i love it, the books are awesome. Great product from a great seller!!! A++ transaction. I would recommend the seller.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I've never seen the original series about this movie, but Johnny Depp's sour humor always amuses me. I thought it was a pretty decent movie. Not the greatest thing he's ever stared in, but a good time killer.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game Is awesome and cool I love it alot you should try it and its free but awesome at the same time
B0014DQSGW|5.0|This movie is great if you want to spend a couple of hours smiling. The dialogues are funny. It is the classical story of a guy who does not notice his work partner because she looks too intelligent to be feminine.
0451532082|5.0|super cute cover and I love the size of it. not too big or too small. Cant wait to read it. Thanks!
B008OOYALE|1.0|Daughter has been playing this game since September.  With a recent update (last few days?) it now requires that I'm signed into the AppStore to actually play the game.  The answer to this is no way.  The way the application asks is so suspect, I'm still not sure if the dialog asking me to sign is legitimate or if it is fishing for my Amazon password.  Needless to say, daughter is no longer playing this game.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|how greedy can amazon be to charge for this app should come with the hd this is sad and greedy do they need the cash that bad? amazon
B007P6VM04|5.0|This will hold me over until Smash returns in January!!  The sound is great on my car stereo. Hopefully another one will be available after the coming season.
B00846REIS|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one!  All my friends love it too...I love her writing and the characters were more real than the Forty Shades of Gray
0811821846|5.0|Last Christmas I gave this book to my college-age nephew who is a Star Wars fan...he loves it!  He went back to school with the book and he and his friends made several of the recipes and were surprised at how tasty the were.  The cookbooks are definitely written for guys and star-wars junkies.  The laminated pages are a stroke of genius in my opinion as cookbooks are easily soiled.  It is a light hearted gift that he got some use out of and will never go into a garage sale!  I recommend for any Star Wars fan!
1582701709|5.0|THANKS THE SERVICE WAS GREAT AND I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IN A TIMELY TIME FRAME. IT WAS GREAT CONDUCTING BUINESS.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|I've head about this book all my life and know that it is a classic.  But I've found it to be one of the more painful books to get into that I have attempted to read.  I've tried and tried but finally given up...would love to know if its one of those books where you have to get to chapter 'x' before things start clicking.  If so, please tell my what chapter that is!!!  I wanted to read it, and wanted to love it as a great classic...haven't been able to do that yet.
B009A9BEHU|1.0|this is the worst ever live concert cd/dvd ever released! as a huge coldplay fan, I must admit that Mylo Xyloto and the tour is by far the worst album and tour from this band.<br />I missed the tour and am VERY happy I did, I regret even buying this live cd/dvd it is a waste of money,please do not buy this mess! it is not worth 1 penny.<br />coldplay need to record an album worth listening to because Mylo Xyloto is horrible and to release a dvd concert of this tour and skip the prior tour is just aweful.............if i could I would not even give this thing a one star, it is just that hideous.<br />coldplay stay away from touring and write an awesome cd again, they are in a HUGE funk...and this is junk!<br />terrible effort.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was reluctant to read the first book because of all of the S&M hype, and I'm not into that so it was a while before I found myself on he bandwagon.  But once I started, I read all (3) Fifty Shades books within 2 weeks (and I have a full time job + a family).  Here's how I sum them up...<br />In the first book I read the S&M sex parts like 'holy crap, people really do this??'....and yes the steamy scenes could leave you needing batteries. By the second book I found myself speed reading through the sex scenes because they had become routine, not 'hot'; by the third book I'd see the word 'erection' and drop down to 'climax' and go on, skipping those scenes all together...I mean 'hot' is good, but enough already!  Forget that these characters (who had more money that God) aren't even 30 yet...I mean we aren't reading this as a true story, even forget about the very hot sexually twisted Christian Grey and you still have a great trilogy.  The author does a fantastic job of getting the reader emotionally invested in Christian Grey's character.  At some point he becomes more victim than Dom....<br /><br />This could have been 2 books easily.  I wish the author had reduced the amount of sex scenes in books 2 & 3 because they because by abundance they became routine and lost the heat they had given me in book 1...I would recommend them.
B00125WAWS|5.0|A must watch. Denzel Washington at his best. Rented it and decided to buy it. Will watch it again soon.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book from beginning to end.<br />The author made the story come to life so vividly and I was taken on a fascinating ride.<br /> I loved it.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|We bought these for a new grandbaby, a first born, and his mommy was very happy.  There is some kind of 'crinkle' noise in the material of the ladybugs for added interest.  Plus, they might even keep the tootsies warm.  Can't go wrong.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I frist played my Minecraft I't was hard to move. But now it is awesome. I just made a pool that is awesome. I can swim in.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is ok but you need to add on next update enchantments then everybody would love this game o and add pickaxe to creative. I am serious that is my review hope it happens .  PEACE
0316069434|3.0|I found The Black Box to be an uneven effort- at times it was all I could do to keep from flipping ahead to see what was going to happen next. but at one or two spots I actually skipped a couple of pages because I was bored.  That's a first for me with Harry Bosch.  The scenes between Harry and precocious daughter Maddie really sing, and I wanted more of them.  In the end the case is wrapped up very neatly.  Harry Bosch is 62 now- Connelly deserves credit for letting his character age in real time instead of being perpetually 45 years old.  But at the same time, Bosch getting the drop on much younger men looks less and less plausible, especially when you consider that Harry lives on donuts and takeout and smoked for decades.  I'm looking forward to Maddie Bosch taking up the torch from her dad at the LAPD.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child have managed to create another wonderful Pendergast novel. Not only do you get an update on Constance, where she fills in more of her history, you get more on Pendergast's wife, and a new twist that I won't give away. The book has a few slow moments, but I finished the book in less than 12 hours. If you like Pendergast's stories, you will greatly enjoy this book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you are looking for a great comic book movie, then this movie is definitely one to add to your collection. Not in recently memory is a cast of such great characters brought together in a way that works to such a degree that it does. There are hardly any lulls, and the action sequences are a marvel to watch. The story also stands on its own, as the five titles that build to this film are not required to know what is going on (however, I strongly recommend you do so, as these are all good films). That being said, the extra content on the dvd doesn't really add to the film much, but are very enlightening and entertaining none the less. All in all, this purchase is a sound choice, and a must have for any comic book and action fan. I personally bought the blu-ray/dvd combo pack, just to have two copies on hand.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I enjoyed this adventure game. Graphics are great and since I don't have the brain power to figure out what to do, having the clues to help was a big plus. The only negative was that in one clue, it gave the wrong room number. Aside from that, I had a lot of fun!
B0037VIBGY|5.0|\\"Bronson\\" is a unique and highly theatrical film in every respect. It is Brechtian in its spotlighted direct addresses to the camera and its dark, scalding humor is reminiscent of Joe Orton. The whole thing is like a thumb in your eye. But what makes this movie truly exceptional is the jaw-droppingly brilliant performance of Tom Hardy. It is fearless, uncompromising, disturbing and utterly beguiling. And it puts him squarely in the midst of the best actors of his generation. (For further confirmation see his extraordinary performance in \\"Warrior.\\")
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book is an easy read but packed with information about why being happy is so important. It gives advice via the Seven Principles on how to attain happiness. It also describes the ripple effect and how to spread happiness. It made me happy just reading it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a very interesting, entertaining story and well written. Highly recommend it! Now, I'm anxious to see the movie.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|This is the best production of Il Divo. It shows more experience and an excellent audience.<br />The four members of the group show greater experiene
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I really love this bag.  It fits my equipment very well with mesh pockets to see items easily in the bag.  I could not be happier.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This one was pretty cool.  Some of this companies apps have been a bit disappointing lately, but not this one.  I totally enjoyed playing this one.
030758836X|5.0|I see that a great number of readers faulted this novel for it's ending. For this reader it seemed just about the most logical ending such a tale could possibly have. If you still don't want to read Gone Girl, then try Jean Paul Sartre's No Exit where you'll get pretty much the same idea.
B008M721MS|2.0|First app used on the brand new Kindle Fire HD. Connected without a problem, but the picture quality was very poor, the voice transmission was spotty at best and the call couldn't stay connected. Was it our Wifi? Well, we disconnected the Skype call and dialed up via Facetime and had no problems at all. I'd say it was the Skype.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Every day I'm notified that there's an update to be downloaded. Click on it and it simply opens the app. What gives?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Graphics were good, storyline was interesting. A good hidden object/ adventure game. Does have zoom for hidden object scene.  Does have hint button if you need it. I liked this game and would recommend it.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I loved this book, except for the ending. I am looking forward to the other books.  Hope Lena finds both her mom & Alex.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It is ok but when ever I try to take this challenge from Betsy it takes me out of the game.
0740748475|5.0|My son will love this set--he was a Calvin himself when he was a young boy! I might have been a more understanding mom if the comic strip had been current back then!!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Very deceptive advertising. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the songs on this CD. That's why it gets 4 stars from me. But come on, where's the best song? As others have said, the sticker on the front said \\"fade into you\\" was included. It's not.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|I like the cover. I haven't listened to it yet, because it is supposed to be for Christmas...LoL I can't wait too though.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Very exciting movie.  it has a lot of action in the movie that my son really loves. We love it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Alexander is a very likeable writer. This book is helpful for scientific minded skeptics.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I love Chris Hemsworth, so I had to buy Thor. My uncle loved it so much I had to get him one too ( since I wouldn't give him mine)
B004UQPM4E|5.0|If you want this superman collection I would recommend going to Best Buy. I've been a big superman fan for a long time and when I saw that it was back for $54.99 I had to get it so I got it for myself as a early Xmas gift for myself. I believe it's going to be that price until Xmas but you might want to ask them yourself. I'm get it there if you don't want to wait for it to be shipped to you
B001HN6922|5.0|You have to have a great sequel for a movie such as cars, and they did it and added more Mater. You'll love it
B005LAII80|4.0|Most of the movie takes place in a large urban housing block called peach tree that is taken from the 2000 a.d. Comic book.  Dredd is accompanied by his rookie partner Anderson as they ascend the chaos amidst bullets and blood that there is no shortage of.  I'm a dredd fan, and I thought it was a good movie, Nuff said!
0425263916|5.0|If your a Fifty Shades of Grey fan and love the complex relationship between Christian Grey and Ana Steele, do pick up this series. The Crossfire Novel trilogy is great to pick up if you want to read a story filled with sex, romance and secrets
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I honestly don't have any complaint. The product arrived right on time and in excellent conditions. The movie is awesome, so I totally recommend to buy this product.
B000H5U832|5.0|My niece forced me to watch it and I loved it. Go Mater! It's a great family movie and extremely funny
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for a fun card game and this fit the bill. I like it better than the classic Freecell.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I've always loved this movie so I got it for my niece. Now she says she want to watch 'rawrr' when she wants to watch lion king
B004JMZPJG|2.0|2 dia de uso y se revento el gancho en la base, mi camara nikon d3100 se golpeo, revisen entes de enviar
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a real fun game and best of all it's free. Gives me an adrenaline rush especially when I pass my previous high score. If you like quick reflex games, this is for you.
B0049H9NVW|4.0|Easy to get fun and with a little bit of strategy and challenge, Good simple fast game for board game enthusist and others who have never played games like this before.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|the 3 hours worn losses!!!<br />all dark knight batman seem directed by Quentin Tarantino!!!<br />seems the decline of the Dark Knight!<br />horrible!!!
B005LAII1C|2.0|The movie had a handful of funny parts if you can get past the fact that teds voice is just Peter Griffin with a slight boston accent. The first half was actually kind of funny but the second half was serious and emotional and the jokes were very few and far between.<br />Probably worth a rent from netflix or redbox but not a dvd I'd buy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The title says it all. Once you start playing, it's hard to stop, and it's always \\"\\"just one more \\" and before you know it,  it's an hour later...
B0055OG2BC|1.0|Just like the good old bond flicks except without all the drinking, guns, women, and gadgets. But hey, at least they threw in a bunch of crappy jokes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has been a GREAT author, but I think this is one of his best!  Lots of great action!  Keep up the good work Mitch Rapp!  (his main character)
0307730697|4.0|A great story that really touched me. It shows what you can accomplish even overcoming long odds and setbacks if you choose.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i wish it had more puzzles but its a great puzzle if you like puzzles. best part is that its free
0525953728|3.0|I was not that I pressed With this book. This was a huge historical event that did not come across that way in the book.
0547564651|4.0|was a gift for my daughter and my grandson. More positive things for her to think about in her parenting
034580404X|5.0|Wow.  Learned a few things I did not know.  Improved my relationship with<br />my sign. other and enjoyed the love story.  Bring on the next book.
0525478817|5.0|When my niece recommended that I read The Fault in Our Stars I was intrigued by her conviction that it was fantastic and yet I was apprehensive about the subject matter.  A book about cancer cannot be anything but sad - can it? Now that I have read it I would just like to clarify that this is NOT a book about cancer; it is a story about teenagers who are living with cancer.<br />It is touching, funny, endearing, and yes, at times sad. It is profound, thought provoking, and beautifully written. This story has touched my soul and I will not forget Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters any time soon.<br /><br />\\"That's the thing about pain ... it demands to be felt.\\"<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone ... male, female, young, and old. It is not like anything I have ever read in the past - it truly is one-in-a-million.
0375507256|4.0|I'll get the not so good stuff out of the way. I think the novel starts off kind of slow, and there are some sexual themes that I could do without. But I've got discriminating tastes in that regard.<br /><br />Okay that's all. Seriously. This book is an impressive piece of literature. If you haven't heard anything about it, the plot line moves through several different narratives within different genres and even different voices (some sections told more from a character's view rather than the omniscient narrator in others). It is engaging and intriguing, and I am excited to see the movie. Read the book if you have seen it, and don't let the quality of the movie bias your view of the book! It's great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can play this game for hours. it keeps my mind going. this game is very addictive. a friend was playing this a nd I started and since then I have gotten three other people playing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I Ordered this from amazon, after it was sold out and best buy within the same day. I was so frustrated because there's the only two places within my driving distance that would have the movie for that price. It came within three days and I was so happy. best 30$ I ever spent. im watching it as we speak and for 30$ it's a steal. all three movies on blu-ray plus bonus disks and a book in a soft shelled case. what's not to like. I do notice that amazon has boosted the price on everyone else after. I dont know why but i guess it's a fast seller and someone is making tons of money off the cuts. But 50$ is still not bad for a boxset of the greatest superhero story besides the avengers... ever...
B005LAIGSC|5.0|This movie starts a bit slow, but once I got past the first ten minutes, I was sucked in and completely absorbed. I loved the tension between the characters, and within the main character himself. Denzel Washington does a great job without stealing the show from Ryan Reynolds.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The basis for the film is truthful and desperately needed in our time - socialism destroys - big government is death - power in the hands of elitists is ruinous - class warfare destroys - but the production of the ideas is tedious, often inane, and overdone by repetition. The hero journey is always relevant and the incorporation of how Robin joins the team and the establishment of the continuation of the journey well thoughtout, but this film should not be the end but the beginning of the rise of good and the reestablishment of order.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Very Happy with the Blu-Ray concert.  I have all the dvd and blu ray videos of Led Zeppelin and Robert Plant and this performance was great.  I wish I was there to see it.  Sound quality is good.  Running through my OPPO Bluray(analog outs) and Sound quality is excellent through PreAmp/Amp separates in 5.1.  Some have knocked the audio, but it sounds good on my system.  FWIW  Overall, I highly recommend this to any Zeppelin fan.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|This has such an independent groove; really dig the freedom the singer has and grooves really well with the music. They have their own style and it's refreshing to find bands that don't follow the banal emptiness of today's music. Pick this up; don't miss out, yo!
B000V8MQZI|5.0|Great record and pressing.  Pressing is flat and quiet.  I own the CD and as most vinyl pressings I prefer the vinyl.  Great price too.
B009YU62H2|3.0|Been a fan for over 20 years. If you're a long time fan, you'll probably give it a 60-65% pass rate. There are a couple of throw-aways (tepid, generic tunes), but over half is good. Favorite song is the last one: &#34;Rowing&#34;, which shows that independent, non-commercial creativity that resonates closer to the pre-Badmotorfinger era music
B002E2M5IC|5.0|I bought this movie because of its great reviews as well as for the fact that its from the Coen brothers.  I was not let down, i love it!
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Okay, this is a great show in any format, but the quality of this Blu-ray product, overall, is outstanding.  I like the way the discs are packaged, and the sound and picture quality are much better than I had hoped.  Also, with 12 episodes per disc, you spend less time changing out discs during a marathon viewing....I highly recommend this product.
B0000844IT|5.0|The very best edition of this movie available. I have two editions of this dvd and unless they release a new bluray, this is the best buy.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has a voice I can listen to for a long time. I have all her recordings and hope to enjoy them for a long time.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|I own a lot of evil dead dvds/blurays and finding one with all of the special features is tough, but this one has all of the old features and two brand new documentaries.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This album is typical Michael Buble.  I love everything about it.  His voice is amazing and smooth as always.  It's sure not to disappoint!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Got this on sale but this series is totally worth the full price. this is a welcome edition to my collection.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Like all Donald Fagen solo albums, Sunken Condos was made to be looped in your car/bus/shaggin' wagon ad infinitum. Over the course of its nine tracks, helicases and polymerases weave the essence of the music into your genetic code. This ensures that you age gracefully, develop excellent taste in sunglasses, and remain sweat-free even in 100 degree heat. You will then turn on the television and discover that you are too funky for 24-hour news networks and NBC sitcoms. When you walk on the beach, you will find that you leave no impression in the sand. Your dog won't recognize you, but he will love the new &#34;you&#34; even more. If you enjoyed Kamakiriad you will very likely enjoy Sunken Condos.
B009DKFSUA|3.0|Love pit bull.  Love previous CDs better. Love the beats.  Prefer his collaborations with other artists.  He is a cool dude
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  It is a great way to pass the time in the Dr office, or just play to relax!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is good game. but I don't like how u have to buy the game. it should cost less then then game.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is one of my favorite games.  I could sit here and play for hours.  BUT if you create too many games, the app will crash.  And it'll crash as soon as you open it.  Which means you will not be able to delete some games you've created.  You'll have to reinstall the app and NOT sign into facebook, starting from scratch and losing all the colors you've earned.  If it wasn't for this, I would've gave it 5 stars.  Keep the games you create to a minimum of 10....maybe even 7 or 8 to be on the safe side.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham, with a few twists and turns I didn't expect. Don't expect to put it down and pick it up later!

0307744434|5.0|Others have alluded to the plot, characters, romance, magic and skilled writing of this book.  For me, it was the sheer genius of this author's imagination in creating Le Cirque des Reves - the amazing feats performed in mysterious tents, the vivid pictures conjured in my mind of the Ice Garden, the role of fire, light, darkness,scent, color, contrast, costume, gastronomy - ah, a true treat in every sense.  It became clear that a movie could/should be made of this story if only to challenge Hollywood to come up with the visuals for Le Cirque.  Loved the book, can't wait for the movie!!
B0052AC8C6|2.0|It took me two tries to watch this movie.  The first try, I fell asleep.  The second try, I fought to stay interested.  This movie could not hold my attention, I don't know how it'll hold a child's attention.  The animation is very well done, but the story line and the humor was lacking. This movie will not be going into my Blu-ray collection.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show so much, I have been watching non stop and really good quality pictures. Would tell people to order from cbs get it right to your home and start enjoying shows.
B008KOTNVA|1.0|I bought this kit to open my 2012 MacBook Air 13\\".  I basically just needed a pentalobe driver to open the case, but I figured it might be a good idea to get an entire kit.  I got this particular kit because it was getting many positive reviews and the ifixit reputation has been excellent.<br /><br />I had no trouble with the pentalobe bit, but the Torx T5 bit for removing componentry literally stripped on the second screw I applied the tool to.  I thought at first it was the screw, but on careful inspection the tip of the bit was the culprit.  I don't know what kind of metal they make it out of, but I am sorely disappointed with this set.  Granted the larger bits will likely have more strength, but my confidence in the toolkit and ifixit products was severely shaken.  1 star.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I really love this show and when I saw it was available on CBS website I ordered right away and have been enjoying this set.
B0085RZ9C4|3.0|The Dawkins delusion is a much better book to read. Let's see what God has to say concerning people who want to hold on to ever changing `scientific, humanistic' ideas rather than holding onto the rock, Jesus Christ [God] as a final authority. In 1 Timothy 6:20 The God Of the Universe says,\\" O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED:\\" God says Dawkins Magic of reality or show makes him into a clown or `fool', not into a true scientist. A true scientist was someone like Sir Isaac Newton whose science is based on a theistic worldview, thus producing the CORRECT kind of science. Dawkins science according to God is full of `profane' and `vain' babblings. He has invented a `fairytale' that might cost him his soul one day, well maybe he will see the light before his time comes. Naturalistic scientific investigation built on faulty metaphysical presuppositions will give one faulty conclusions. That is what happened in Dawkins imagination.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I was a little skeptically at first after reading some of the reviews but decidedto give it a try. I absolutely. love this game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of the best series I have read.  The character development and scene descriptions are outstanding.  At the end of each chapter, I was left wanting more.  Be forewarned though, the ending of the book is the same way. For those that like all the loose ends tied up... read it anyway.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book. Where should I start? I heard really good things about this book, but I was still apprehensive about reading it because I'm more of an action/ fiction kinda girl. I'm never really in to realistic fiction. But this book blew me away. This book gave me a whole new perspective on life and its value. I finished this book the same day a mass school shooting happened just ten miles from me. Little children had their lives ripped from their hands and the whole country felt the grief. It was the second worst school shooting in history. All of this made me think about how easily that could have been me or my brother or my best friend. Then, when I finished this book,  I realized that human life is a fragile thing. You need To value it. This book really changed my life. I would recommend it to anyone, even if they hated these types of books. {Oh, and BTW, I cried really hard at the end}
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so fun!!!!! I battle my friends how far can we go until we die!!!!! GET THIS GAME IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!

B0083P1QUM|5.0|I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwell, I have read all of her Scarpetta book and think they are great rads, I'd recommend her books to any one who likes a good mystery, but suggest they start with her first.

B000S1NUM6|1.0|The album itself is great, but that that sold me was terrible quality and I had to throw it away. I recommend to all intelligent people.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My family and I saw this movie in the theater and found it delightful. This film is representative of the quirky greatness that is typical of Tim Burton's best works. The material may be a little scary for younger children. My daughter was five and became a little frightened, she does not typically scare easy. However, over all there is nothing too horrifying, especially on the smaller screen.<br /><br />The relationship between Victor and Sparky (boy and dog)is sweet and realistic. Anyone who has lost a dog in the past will feel Victor's pain when Sparky dies at the beginning of the movie. I was concerned that the ending would be terribly sad for the young child, but it wasn't. We enjoyed all the throwbacks to classic horror movies (Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, & Godzilla....etc.) The stop motion filming is spot on and adds to the overall tone of the movie.<br /><br />If you enjoy Tim Burton films I highly recommend this \\"Franken Weenie\\" which is suitable for most youth and adult audiences.
B000HFPQK2|5.0|A great album. I listened to it many times and still enjoyable. Bee Gees is the golden heritage and these will be gone.

B0013O123Q|1.0|Right up there with Doom Generation for Worst Film I've Ever Seen. Don't waste your time. It begins with an eye-assaulting piece of camera work that is meant to evoke an adrenaline-fueled confrontation, but only serves to annoy the viewer. Cutting an insipid film into reverse chronological order makes this a one-trick-pony.

030758836X|2.0|This was not a satisfying read at all. It left me upset at the end. The first section of the book was interesting, and then the second part just got me mad, but I was already invested and wanted to know how it ended.  So, I read the second half of the book quickly, just to get it over with. I wanted to spend as little time with the characters as possible. Anyway, I finished it today. And I've already \\"Not Recommended\\" it to someone.

B00979CS50|4.0|LOSE YOURSELF AND FLOAT DOWNSTREAM...<br /><br />From the first notes on acoustic guitar that streams into Neil's lilting electric on the cool \\"Driftin' Back\\" it is a mood, a feeling. This is a headphone, lose yourself album. Kind of like the scene in Almost Famous where the sister gives her younger brother The Who's Tommy before she leaves home and says something like this will change you put it on and lose yourself, an engulfing experience.<br /><br />The song \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" is kind of like the B Side to \\"Time\\" by the Chambers Brothers. A lost sixties trippy single. With the flangy, treated sound and catchy druggy thing goin' on. Cool song. The whole record is strong lots of jamming. Really cool lyrics. Some nostalgia. But the cool surreal poetic Neil thing on \\"She's Always Dancing\\" is vintage, what i really love about him. Great record. Not a bad song. Great guitar playing. Great band. Great songs.<br /><br />The one thing i hadn't read in other reviews is how cool the packaging is. The closest i've ever experienced in a CD to an old album. Great artwork, style, and a cool little book with the lyrics in it. Just a nice piece of well thought out coolness. Great CD package, really well thought out and beautiful.<br /><br />LOSE YOURSELF, SURRENDER TO THE VOID, IT IS NOT DYING....<br /><br />\\"She's Always Dancing<br />Now And Forever<br />From Palm To Palm<br />From Hand To Hand<br />Floating In The Air<br />She Loves To Find It There<br /><br />She Loves To Burn<br />Out On The Edge<br />That's Where She Lives<br />That's When She Gives<br />Floating In The Smoke<br />She Says It Gives Her Hope<br /><br />She Has The Fire<br />But It's Burning Now<br />From Hand To Hand<br />From Palm To Palm<br />Floating In The Air<br />She Tries To Hold It There<br /><br />She Want To Live Without Lies That Bind Her Down<br />She Wants To Dance With Her Body Left Undound<br />She Wants To Spin Like She Lives In Her Own World<br />She Wants To Dream Like She Was A Little Girl\\"<br /><br />Neil in 1966 or 2012?<br /><br />Rock On!!!!!!\\"<br /><br />Neil in 1966 or 2012?<br /><br />Rock On!!!!!!
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Super high quality and it has everything. It's not bloated, it's exactly what it has it is, if you don't want a tone of amazing extras, buy the mp3s.
B000001EUL|5.0|It's the songs. The songs are great. When i put on this record, all the way through it holds my attention with variety, originality and rock 'n roll glory. Up with any album made. Classic!!!<br /><br />The licks grab you, the singing brings you in and then the whole vibe surrounds you. I love the Uli stuff ([[ASIN:B0000073NC Fly to the Rainbow]], [[ASIN:B0018KKPM4 In Trance (24bt)]] ) Uli is incredible. One of the best transcendent guitarists to pick up an ax. Michael Schenker ([[ASIN:B0018YIW4S Strangers in the Night]], [[ASIN:B00004NJJQ Phenomenon]], [[ASIN:B00003ZKS1 Michael Schenker Group]], and [[ASIN:B001LYD2K4 Msg]]) just incredible. Michael really contributes here. \\"Coast To Coast\\" is really his thing, his signature style is all over it. But what i've recently discovered is Rudolf Shenker is really the architect of The Scorpions songs musically in any era. His simple riffing and licks and direction in the Uli era to now is the substance of The Scorpions. Admittedly the Scorpions are over the top but at the same time they are dead serious musically.  But i've loved their best stuff from when i first heard it till today. They rock, to me.<br /><br />Not a bad song here. Just memorable, fresh and rockin'. To me, up with any record by anyone. Get Lovedrive. If you own one Scorps album this is the one to own. Just great music. Everything up to Love At First Sting is great but Lovedrive is their best. Rockin'.........!

B009VSW15Y|5.0|I tried out the built in Camera and desired more functionallity.  Read the reviews and this looked like very useful addition to accomodate my needs.  No problem downloading or using especially with the on-line manual.  The panorama function is really fun and effective but the image comes out upside-down when viewing on the Fire HD.  I contacted the developer and he replied almost immediately to say that he was working on it but this was going to be a tough one to solve.  This is only a minor nuisence and is easily fixed in Windows Live Photo Gallery.  I would definitely recommend this to other Fire HD users.
1881273156|5.0|I think everyone should read this book.<br />Though it isn't the only thing in a relationship that matters....this makes a LOT of sense, and if you really think this through it will help you understand things.<br />Including your family members, friends, and children.<br />Take the time to read it. About 2 hrs.<br />I have used it over and over.<br />It actually helped me decide what gifts to give to certain people :)
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have been listening to this album since I downloaded it.  It keeps getting richer and richer.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When deciding to read John Green's \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\", I knew what I was setting myself up for. I've officially accepted that I am indeed a masosadist.<br /><br />\\"That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt.\\"<br /><br />I've lost a lot of people to cancer in my lifetime. From a young age, I've learned to coupe with these \\"grenades\\" in anyway imaginable, much as you read about in Stars.<br /><br />\\"Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.\\"<br /><br />Green's Book is the story of life through eyes that are very much living for the moment. People told me that I would cry. Did I? Yes, and actually on two flights between Milwaukee and Fort Lauderdale {marvelous timing for a sad read right?!}. But I unlike many readers didn't find myself crying from start to finish. What some saw as a depressing story about death and sickness, I saw a story of survival, love, and honesty which was beautiful to read.<br /><br />\\"Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.\\"<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus put things in perspective for you. I got all the way to 78% before I started to cry. I was starting to think I was heartless, but as I sat to start writing the review, I just realized that I related so much to this read. More than any book I've ever read.<br /><br />\\"Only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishness of trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation: I couldn't unlove Augustus Waters. And I didn't want to.\\"<br /><br />I ultimately read this book because I didn't believe Green could write a story that truly embraced how it felt to deeply love a person, with cancer, and lose them. The feeling is indescribable, and in the end, yeah, I got my answer. Wow. Dead on. Glad I read it, but I'm going to find my heart. I think it's on the floor, stomped on.<br /><br />\\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.\\"<br /><br />Warning: You will cry {I currently have a stomach ache just writing this review}, your heart will be broke, and you will be a better person after finishing this book. And have the next read ready, I walked around in a haze for hours until I could start my post \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" book.

B0076DELIG|2.0|99% of this novel is boring. Connelly shares this observation about the drudgery of investigations and he does an admirable job mirroring the percentage breakdown between boredom and excitement. I am not suggesting that there should have been fights, gun shots, and car chases on each page as that would rob the series of realism. However, this Harry Bosch outing was exceedingly slow and predictable. It is definitely a procedural without much tension or mystery. All of Harry's home life travails which have helped forge a connection with the detective were absent. Also missing was empathy for the victim because the author failed to humanize the character. I remain a committed fan but I could have been skipped this one as it felt very much like a one-off that is disconnected from the life Connelly has created for Harry.

So is anyone going to offer an explanation as to why the CD is missing one of the best songs from the series, Fade Into You, even though it is listed on the sticker with the package?

B0015DWJX2|5.0|In the days directly proceeding WWII, writer Juliet Ashton is slowly rebuilding her life and looking towards her future. Stumped as to what her next novel should be about, she finds herself corresponding with fellow literary lovers from the Island of Guernsey. This group of people begin to share with Juliet how they survived the German occupation of their island during the war, with their wit and thriftiness. As they share more and more, Juliet falls in love with the island and their literary club - so she decides to make them her next book's topic! She quickly relocates to Guernsey, and becomes just as captivated with the island as she already had with its inhabitants.<br /><br />My grandmother recommended this book to me over a year before I got a chance to read it. I'm just sorry it took me so long!! The format of the novel is a series of letters between Juliet and her best friend, editor, agent, love interest - and of course, the people of The Guernsey Literary And Potato Peel Pie Society. If you don't have much time to read a novel, the format of letters makes it easy to pick up and read when you have pockets of time. However, you will be so captivated that you won't be able to put the book down!<br />Even though it is a work of complete fiction, the authors did an excellent job of researching for accuracy and paying attention to details. Their character development was incredible, they managed to balance their cast of characters while still having some *very* interesting & unique characters.<br /><br />There are two main plots: life during the war, and after the war. Both are intertwined magnificently by the authors' using the recovery post-war to tell the story of life during the war. I'm not sure how to better describe it - but take my word for it - it was a feat of genius to accomplish.<br /><br />This book is for anyone really - literary lovers, WWII enthusiasts, and those who just love a great book!

I definetely recommend this book for preparation for the exam. By the way, this is a book that gives great tips to avoid common errors during the IELTS. It is not an english study book, it is an IELTS guide to maximize your score with the English language knowledge that you already have and want to measure by taking the IELTS.

B00797MB0O|5.0|No, she's not quite that bad. If you are expecting the traditional American Rom Com with rosy happy ending and predictable in the first 10 minutes, you will hate this movie.<br /><br />Mavis Gary is having a crisis. Work is pressing for the last book in the teen series she writes continuing the story created by another writer. With out the acclaims. No one knows she writes it and the series is dying. So she is rethinking her life/loves after a divorce. You can see the world pressing in on her brain. And her journey begins back to the happy days she wants to recapture.<br /><br />The poor girl is neurotic and evil. Or maybe sees others as a means to what she wants. She plays the emotionless flat affect with the antisocial behavior to a tee. The scenes with her mother and father and the hair pulling disorder trichotillomania bring in some reality and focus I thought. As the movie progresses you see her evolution or will it end up devolution. I could not tell where she would end up. And I admit it ended more realistic I think. Scene with the sister is sublimely ironic. Karma.<br /><br />You still kind of like her even at the end. Just a little bit. This is due to the skill of Charlize Theron and a Diablo Cody script, directed by Reitman. The scenes with Patton Oswalt are fantastic. They need to work together more.<br /><br />This is more of a character study I think than a dark comedy. Though there are elements of dark humor. And Charlize, can she do a bad movie or part? I tried to remember a bad part she did and came up empty. Monster, a movie I didn't really like, was some great acting. I think you could put a bucket on her head while painting a fence and it would turn out good.<br /><br />If you like varied types of movies you should see this. At times I wanted to look away from the screen at what she was about to do. Don't listen to the one star reviews. No way is this only a one star. There are plenty of factory produced American films to make them happy. I like a good factory produced happy ending predictable movie complete with silliness but I need films like this too. Something to break into the numbness-watch this movie to see what I mean.<br /><br />Free on Prime. Thank you Amazon.good factory produced happy ending predictable movie complete with silliness but I need films like this too.

0345803485|5.0|E. L. James captivated me me with \\"The Fifty Shades\\" trilogy. The books characters were amazing. I could not put the books down and when they ended, I yearned for more. I could follow Christian and Ana forever if the pages kept going. The sensual love in this book was so genuine. I had a husband who knew how to please a woman and this author must have one who does too. Either that or she is just knows the art of sensuality. No holds we're barred. E. L. James, Bravo and encore. I will probably read it again. Simply superb writing and story content. What a delicious journey.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I absolutely love love love this movie.  it explains a lot of things from the first 2 movies!!  I have all 3 now and am going to watch a MIB marathon woohoo!!

B009RI4ZKC|2.0|I wanted to like this movie and it did have its moments but mostly I found myself looking for stuff to read during the movie to keep me even halfway engaged...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I was so engaged and couldn't take my eyes off the book. I can't wait till I read the next book
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a very thought provoking book that helped me realize that we all spend too much time worrying about time!<br /><br />This book has now entered the &#34;top ten list&#34; of all time favorite books...<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read and enjoy a book that really makes you appreciate the time we have...<br /><br />I have sent this book to everyone in my family (all 10 of them) for Christmas.<br /><br />Keep up the great writing Mitch!!!
B006ZDU7QI|1.0|But after that the album was not my taste.  I think if it wasnt like 2.99 I probably wouldnt have bought it
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is an awesome game, very easy to learn but tough to put down. Sit. Back and let  your creative juices flow!
B0093LINT2|5.0|Picked one of these up, can't believe how small it is!<br /><br />Awesome little computer. Version I got had a 128gb Solid State Drive and 8 gigs of ram. Runs Windows amazing, can even do dual display due to the two HDMI cables on the back. WiFi works good on it and even sports a GLAN Ethernet port. Doesn't overheat, last reviewer is a typical Apple knob. This thing blows a Mac Mini out of the water. Boots Windows 8 in like 3-4 seconds from cold boot!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Detail, detail, detail.<br /><br />I've tried Accuweather, Go Weather, Go Weather EX, Weather Underground, etc. & none are as detailed, convenient, beautiful, elegant, & as customizable as eWeather HD.<br /><br />Not only does eWeather have the most information hands down, it allows you to see so much of it at once with an elegant & customizable screen or widget. I personally love \\"big screen\\" mode, on which I can see the 24 hour forecast complete with temperature chart of the highs & lows, wind, & sky forecast (cloudy, rainy, etc.) along with the 10 day forecast ALL IN ONE SCREEN. Any hour or day can be clicked on for more detail. No other app gives me so much detail so quickly & looks so good doing it. Not to mention the availability of the weather map, radar, earthquakes, & the ability to email an incredibly detailed forecast to someone.<br /><br />The hour by hour widget is similarly amazing for how much useful information can fit in so small a space.<br /><br />Also, the customer support is extraordinary. I lazily asked a question about how to navigate one aspect of the program at 4am and received an intelligent reply by an actual person completely answering my question literally within minutes. There was even  a customized screenshot included helping to clearly instruct me on how to find what I was looking for.<br /><br />It's an awesome weather program & worth every penny.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This book really helped me understand how the A's could win so many games with their low payroll. Great book.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|Everyone always comments on the light and I think that means they see me which is good. Easy to install and use. Seems durable.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves these books and the movies, and is going to be thrilled to get this book for Christmas
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris is every teacher's nightmare, but every kid's secret envy.  Even grown-ups wish sometimes that they could just kick back, play hookey, and get &#34;out of the box,&#34; if only for a little while. Great movie.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've just had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for about a week now and Splashtop was one of my first apps. It has a learning curve but it's well wort he effort. It's my best app. I have over 200 now.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Songs are great, but just a word of advice for this cd. ABSOULUTELY not for young kids or teens ears.  FILTHY lyrics.. so its in my car on on mp3 player.  I have a daughter who is 18 and i would not listen to one of the songs on it with her in car.  But CD is great music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|First my name is Nathaniel.I love minecraft and this is as close to it as I can get.

0525953728|5.0|This is well written account of the life of a Navy Seal, not just any Navy Seal but one of the ones that was able to reduce this Earth of one less insect! Thanks to all of those that have served!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I'm usually a Pac Man fan and I usually love Namco Bandai games, but...this one felt incomplete.  Not just the lack of clarity regarding in app purchases (which I think was a bad move), but the controls felt very off, even for a smartphone game.  Not worth the download; c'mon guys, you can do better than this.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Grandson, age 6, loves it.  He and his siblings working to complete the puzzle successfully  This is a great toy.
0802473156|4.0|This book is awesome! The 5 Love Languages was very helpful. It's a fun read and very interesting! Nice price too!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Before I read this book I read some harsh criticisms from fellow Ice and Fire fans.  I am glad  to say that I whole heartily disagree.  All of Martin's books have been thrilling an  hold a special place in my heart. He may not have kept telling the story from the beloved characters of the first three books but all chapters, regardless of whose vantage  point they were from, held meaning and  contributed to the overall telling of this fantastic story.
B0059H05VI|4.0|Wife wanted this album and she judged it OK, listened to it one time.  I like it, but prefer other songs by M5.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|john grisham's name sells the  book due to his older works; however, this book was well done in the first person. well worth reading but not grisham's best.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|So you know how a song sticks with you an entire day?  I can say this for the entire album.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|i have read every jack reacher book and look for the new one every year. could not wait to see the movie but with tom cruise? give me a  break.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I rate I've got your number 4 stars because it flows very effectively and is a blast to read. I caught myself laughing out loud numerous times Poppy Wyatt was cute and hilarious. But Sam Roxton was the highlight of this book for me . I could just picture this debonair sweetheart thru  the entire book.This is a book for the female sex , I don't picture men reading anything like this.But most women should really love this book,I did!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|love this game. graphics are amazing. i enjoy all the g5 entertainment adventure games. thank you for another great game.
030758836X|5.0|Its one of those books where I borrowed it, read it and I just have to have it in my book collection. And Gillian Flynn is one of the authors on my list to read all of her books. \\"Gone Girl\\" is about a marriage gone totally wrong. Its about a boy meeting a \\"really cool chick\\", and this girl turns out to be not what he thought she was. This book had so many hooks in it I couldn't put it down! I kept thinking \\"did he kill her?\\" I was on her side in the beginning, then out of no where, in some weird twist, I was on HIS side. The ending is a bit of a downer, it left me hanging and curious what was going to happen next. is there going to be a part two? a sequel? or maybe that's just what the author was going for. She wanted us to finished the story. Make us wonder what happened. What do YOU think happened?? Read this book and find out!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Not bad of a story line. I love hidden object games. 1 star taken away due 2 zooming in, u get hit with a time pentaly due 2 every time u touch the screen 2 move it around, the game counts it as a miss click.
B00000DCHI|3.0|the cd box was broken so the cd's fell out of the box<br />the musicf from the cd is okay
1582701709|5.0|I already had a copy of this book.  I bought extras for people who might be interested in improving their lives.  It doesn't matter if you're religious or not, this book will help you with your goals and wants.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|You may not see slender man till about four pages in, but when u do you'll s*** brix. I GUARANTEE its the best slender game so far on kindle, iPad, android, and every tablet.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (almost) promised to be uplifting from the first chapter.  Filled with hope and totally unprepared, Harold Fry walked off from his boring life to help an old friend.  During the course of his \\"pilgrimage,\\" Harold met many strange and interesting people.  I was not prepared to be so sad during the last section of the book; there were several painful surprises.  While I couldn't put this book down, I felt that it was unexpectedly a tear-jerker.
0812984412|5.0|I bought the book to enlarge on my experience with the movie. I can now understand more of the story and the concepts presented.
1451695195|5.0|Having had my own experiences with life after death only to a much lesser degree, I was interested in the perspective from a much more learned, scientific, and skeptical person than I.  All I can say is that I was drawn into this book and found it hard to put down.  Using my discernment, I felt the truth in Eben Alexander's words and I believe.  This book offers great comfort and I am sharing it with as many possible.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Lots of room to hold your camera with several lenses and other goodies as well. The shoulder straps are very comfortable. Quality bag.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a heart warming novel that is told from the point of view of the protagonist's dog.<br /><br />I am not a very emotional person, but when it comes to animals (especially dogs) I find that the tears flow down like the Monsoon season in India. And this novel is no exception.<br /><br />The best part of the novel though is that it allows us to see ouselves as our pets may see us. Heroic but flawed. I high recommend this book to anyone who is a dog lover, enjoys race cars, or just wants to read a novel that will leave you feeling better about mankind (and dogkind too).
B002JTHFUS|5.0|Did not expect anything other than a great package! Very well done and, if you are a U2 fan, collect this recording.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I highly recommend this transmitter when used with the wireless earphones.  It works as advertised and is excellent when working out at the fitness center.
B005LTDPJI|4.0|Needs individual sleeves to protect the cds from scratches. Had to purchase my own, as most of these sets don't have the individual sleeves.<br /><br />Seller was top shelf.
1931559317|4.0|I haven't used this book much yet, because I am still a rank beginner in backyard astronomy.  However, I can tell by its organization and layout I will get a lot of use out of it as I get better acquainted with the night skies.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|As others have said it would be  nice to be able to zoom in on objects, not too big a deal for my 10 inch screen, but I can see where a smaller screen would have problems. So far I have enjoyed this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ok it is good too pass the time when you are bored.  also time flies when your having fun.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love listening
B005TMSN4E|3.0|I have a relatively old D2X and a bunch of expensive F-mount DX lenses but I found myself all too frequently using a simple point-and-shoot camera when not in my studio. The D2X is simply too much to haul around. The Nikon1 V2 seemed like a good compromise and I figured I could continue to get value out of my F-mount DX lenses using the FT-1 adapter.<br /><br />The FT-1 adapter works reasonably well. I have an AF-S Nikkor 17-35mm f/2.8 lens which I find very comfortable to use with the FT-1 and the V2.<br /><br />However, the multi-zone focus that the native CX lenses have, doesn't work with the F-mount lenses. The V2 FT-1 AF-S Nikkor combination ONLY uses auto-focus from the central area of the lens and in some circumstances (I haven't figured out yet exactly what) fails to auto focus at all and manual focusing is necessary. I have experience the same issue with my AF-S Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8 lens too.<br /><br />Secondly, I have a 10.5mm Nikkor fisheye which is listed as compatible with the FT-1 but it ONLY functions with manual focus. This is a shame because the 2.7 multiplier tones down the aggressive nature of the fisheye and it could be useful.<br /><br />Nikon's multi-language compatibility list for the FT-1 is stupidly long, yet they fail to describe exactly which features are present and which are absent. I begin to wonder if Nikon has actually tested the FT-1 with ALL the lenses they list with ALL the Nikon 1 cameras or more simply figured they were mechanically compatible. One expects better from a $200 product.<br /><br />MUCH LATER<br />I upgraded my Nikon1 V2's firmware (A&B) to 1.1 and the FT-1's firmware to 1.2 but still no autofocus, though it seems Nikon can make it work for the Nikon1 V3 -- they are utter swine.
B005LAII1C|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie because of the funny commercial, but when I saw it I was so disappointed. It had a lot of really lame jokes like Mark's character farting in a restaurant. This was just a lame movie.
B000SW16M6|5.0|I loved this when it came out all those years ago, though it doesn't seem like that many, it is.  I still laugh when &#34;Guido the killer pimp&#34; is said by a buddy of mine when somehting is chasing anything.  There really was a lesson to be learned back then, breaking a few rules when you are younger makes you a better man tomorrow (and every day there after).  Till my knees can't take it, the wife will have to deal with impromptu dance sesions when Old Time Rocking Roll comes on anywhere.  I wish the powers that be could make the movies feel like they did back then.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This was a gift for my Grandson and he is very pleased with it. It seems to be of good Quality.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I didn't have a problem with the cord, except for the fact that my dog ate it. (Actually,its my grandson's puppy.)  It was a black cord and I note the only available color for replacement is white.  I hope it works with the more advanced charger.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I have played it everyday since I bought it. The graphics are a little outdated, but it is a great game none the less!
1400067820|3.0|1 Summary<br />----------<br />1.1 Introduction<br />==========<br />Taleb conveniently quotes one of his friend's summary of this book: \\"Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty.\\"<br /><br />I think the point is better expressed by rephrasing: \\"Antifragility is what gains from volatility and uncertainty, up to a point. And being antifragile is a good thing.\\"<br /><br />Well, that's pretty much summarizes this 500-pages-long book. The rest is an accumulation of more or less relevant topics, delivered in Taleb's trademarked seering, holier-than-thou, hero-or-moron style. Why, even in \\"Dynamic hedging\\", his first, $100-book on trading exotic options, he was already both immensely entertaining and almost unbearably infuriating.<br /><br />1.2 A few of the more interesting points:<br />=========================<br /><br />1.2.1 Every phenomenon in the world belongs to one of the following categories:<br />Fragile: vulnerable to unforeseen shocks<br />Robust: indifferent to  shocks<br />Antifragile: thrive on shocks, up to a point.<br />That's what Taleb calls the Triad.<br /><br />1.2.2 Most modern structures are inherently fragile<br />Salaried employment: while it looks safe on the surface (predictable salary every month) it is subject to the catastrophic risk of losing one's job.<br />Debt-fueled economies: debt has no flexibility, so these economies can't stand even a slowdown without risking implosion (cf current situation)<br />Modern societies: efficiency demands are pushing the structures to the maximum, so a little sand in the cogs make the whole edifice totter.<br />Touristification: turning adventures (kids growing up, people visiting foreign countries) from exciting, dangerous activities into bland, Disneyfied and safe ones.<br /><br />1.2.3 Ways to be antifragile include:<br />Stressors: it is healthy to be subject to some punctual stresses to awake the organism from complacency (e.g. irregular meal times, violent exercise or ingesting small amounts of poison)<br />Barbell strategy: put 90% of your eggs into something super-safe and be very risk-seeking with the other 10% (swing for the fences).<br />Optionality: get into situations where downside is limited but upside is unlimited (non-linearity)<br />Redundancy: have more than one way to have things done.<br />Less is more: don't add unnecessary things.<br />Tinkering: empiricism is better than top-down academic research<br />Small is beautiful: large organizations are inherently fragile, but small structures are well adapted to be nimble and profit from unexpected opportunities.<br /><br />1.2.4 For small troubles, better trust nature and do nothing than bring untested methods that can have tragic unforeseen consequence<br />Beware of neomania: don't embrace novelty for the sake of it<br />Stick to time-tested methods: what has stood the test of time has proved to be robust<br />Don't sweat the small stuff if it can lead to tragedy: radiation used to cure acne leading to leukemia, thalidomide prescribed to reduce morning sickness leading to malformed babies.<br /><br />1.2.5 An antidote to the lack of accountability seen in the powerfuls who rule us (government officials, corporate honchos, bankers)<br />Have them have skin in the game, i.e. to share in the downside of their decisions. Taleb quotes the 3000-year-old+ Hammurabi code, \\"eye for an eye, teeth for a teeth.\\"<br /><br />2 Review<br />---------<br />So, what's the score? As with his other books, I found myself reading every page the first 40-50 pages, then turning the pages faster and faster as the neat, amusing prose turns into Fidel Castro-style interminable ramblings, hyperboles and inaccuracies, annoying personal anecdotes, and worst of all, the silly little tales with his imaginary heroes Nero Tulip and Fat Tony (Tulip seems to be some kind of idealized version of Taleb himself). One or two hours for the first third, 40 minutes for the second and 15 minutes for the last.<br />And I'll spare (or maybe not) the \\"very technical\\" appendix 2 with its silly little formula he seems to be so proud of. Thanks for teaching us high-school math about convexity (Jensen inequality as if it were rocket science? Come on!)<br /><br />The basic point is sound however: we sure all need a bit more antifragility in our lives.<br />If we only ditched what is unnecessary (going to the doctor for trivial stuff, seeking novelty for the sake of it, buying stuff we don't need), we'd have gone a long way toward being more robust.<br />But going beyond that is more problematic: Taleb waxed lyrical about the upside of antifragility, but he says nothing about its cost.<br />And seeing how he came to his idea from the world of options trading, it looks dishonest. In options trading, when you buy and option and get all the good stuff associated with it (unlimited upside, limited downside), the flipside is that it costs money everyday (time decay). Spending all your time buying options is quite a good way to the poorhouse.<br />As in the financial world, so in the real world, unless you're talking about \\"free optionality\\" (the people who don't have skin in the game that Taleb reviles). Maybe being a free agent beats being an office drone because one doesn't need to fear getting fired, but what about the daily stress of needing to go out and find work without any certainty to get it? That's a cost that's a bit too high for probably most people.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an imperfect, overlong and often eye-roll-inducing book (as is usual for Taleb), but it presents an intriguing and original argument for the reader to chew on.nd 15 minutes for the last.<br />And I'll spare (or maybe not) the \\"very technical\\" appendix 2 with its silly little formula he seems to be so proud of.

B00632HWOG|1.0|The new version shut my Kindle down even before I could see any of my e-mail. There must be a bug.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down. I am in complete awe and I must have more! I am ready to keep going.
B003VANOFY|4.0|My 1 complaint is that there is no toggle to swap between regular speakers and headphones. you have to unplug the USB antenna to swap out to regular speakers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't love Solitaire - this is a nice way to fill time and an easy game to play alone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my favorite game for me to play in my spare time which I do not have enough time but enjoy the game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love to play this game.  It is a nice time filler.  Wish the game had more levels as it stops at 105 but still a great game to play.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|have not read this yet  but will enjpy this book to read when time is allowed for me after christmas
B008D19WBQ|5.0|CANNOT SPEAK TO CONTENT YET... but so far so good. It came in less than a week after ordering. Looks nice, giving as an xmas gift. Waaaay cheaper than in the stores. It was on sale here for $149.99; same day best buy had it for 179.99.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Wonderful story . . . Great to include the original illustrations!  It is a classic yet very easy to read.
B004CYKZZA|4.0|Great product that gave me no problems when I first bought it and used at an extended-stay motel this past summer.  Bathroom, bedroom, kitchen-----great reception and no degradation.<br /><br />Inside my house built in 1934?  Mmmmmmmm not so much.  Walls must be thicker because as soon as I leave the room my computer is in, the reception becomes unacceptable.  I \\"blame\\" this problem on my house as houses built these days aren't nearly as sturdy as mine.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is one of those games that is fun and doesn't get boring after playing it for a while, but it isn't as good as the original

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|this movie has spectacular 3D effects<br />Movie is 5 out of 5<br />3D is 5 out of 5<br />A must have for your 3D collection
0061726834|5.0|I read this some time back, but did not review it at the time.  Now I've decided to throw in my 2 cents.  It's great.  Read it.  I held off reading it for months, defying friends, family and  reviews, because I thought it sounded too meh.  But finally I picked it up and was pulled into the story almost immediately and into Lena.  She starts out convinced that love must be cured and, of course, by the end she is fighting to maintain love at all costs.  What a great story line, huh?  Yes, it sounds like you might not be able to buy into this weird world where love is a disease to be cured, but trust me, you will.  Yes, I didn't think the storyline could work, but it did and how.  The relationship between Lena and Alex is one for the ages.  Savor it.  These kind of romances don't come along that often.  I've read some reviews that didn't like this book.  Ignore them.  They didn't read the same book I did, or they read it, but happened to be in the middle of a distracting hemorrhoid episode or something.  This is dystopia.  This is romance.  This is action.  It's the full monty, so to speak.  And its well written.  You can't claim to be a fan of YA dystopia if you haven't read this book.

006197806X|5.0|Having just given my 2 cents on Delirium, I have to follow up with my 2 cents on this book.  I had delayed reading Delirium to the point where I was able to read it and then turn immediately to reading Pandemonium.  That was pretty cool, not having to wait for book 2 to come out.  I came to Pandemonium minutes from having read Delirium, drunk on Lena and Alex and love and loss, etc, etc, and discovered pretty quickly this is a different book. . . or so I thought at first.  We have two parallel stories going on, Lena making her way with the resistance and Lena in the city on a mission.  It was a little jarring at first trying to juggle these story lines, but it was worth the effort as they gradually developed into two gripping dramas.  What makes this story work for me is Julian.  I came into this book a huge fan of Alex and there was some queasiness when I first saw Julian.  But, as the story went on and we got to know Julian, I was in his corner.  And this book adds so much depth to Lena, taking her far, far beyond the impish rebel we had at the end of Delirium, that you have to read this book just for that.  In the end, you soar and fall with the ups and downs of Lena, and I never thought I would say this, but you end up rooting for Julian.  Sorry Alex.  Step aside.  Oh, and then there's the ending.  What's it going to be: Alex or Julian?  Well, I have my theories, but we'll just have to wait and read Requiem to find out.

0525952926|3.0|I love all of Ken Follett's books, and especially enjoyed re-reading Fall of Giants before starting Winter of the World.  This is a good book and I'm glad that I read it.  I enjoyed following the history as well as the lives of the characters from the first book.  It is well-written and it doesn't take long to get absorbed into the story.  But I did feel that it was somewhat contrived because the characters just happened to be in the right place to witness all of the major events of WWII.  And Mr. Follett has always included sex in his books, but this one just seemed way overdone on that front...to the point where it seemed he included it wherever possible just for the fun of it.  In other books, it was mostly tastefully woven into the story.  In this book, it's again and again and again.  It became a little tiresome.

B009VB7QQA|4.0|I was surprised by the this movie. Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter??? Well this turned out to be a pretty good movie. The production was very good and the acting and story all worked well. Your not going to find much humor in it. Though the title might make a person think of a cheesy teen horror flick, it has a serious tone throughout. It's a little gory and maybe not a good one to watch with the kids if they are very young. But overall it's a good movie that kept my wife, step-son, daughter, and myself all staring at the screen until the end. I can easily recommend this movie for and entertaining movie night at home.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is collection of five novellas set in a silo. Yes, you read that right. A silo. The setting is Earth after a cataclysm has forced the remnants of humanity to live in a large, hermetically sealed underground silo.<br /><br />Life in the Silo is a regimented grind. Howey conveys the idea that humanity is toughing it out in the Silo until conditions on the surface improve. He doesn't tell us how long it's been, but certainly hundreds of years doesn't seem a stretch.<br /><br />We are given very few clues as to how things got to this state and those relatively late in the books. At one point Atlanta is mentioned, so presumably the setting is the US. Late in the book one of the characters is entrusted with a secret history of the silo and we learn that the events that caused this cataclysm were intentional. Howey gives us some vague hints of a nationalist plot with racial overtones. He talks about a group of people destroying the Earth to preserve a 'way of life'. Pretty dark stuff.<br /><br />The books progress through several main viewpoint characters. They hold some of the key positions in Silo life (Mayor, Sheriff, head of IT) and through them we learn the secrets of Silo life. Life in the Silo is about control. Mankind teeters on the edge of extinction so a delicate balance must be maintained. We also learn that in the past there have been revolutions in the Silo and so the powers that be do everything they can to keep the population ignorant of the past.<br /><br />I liked how Howey moved the story through several different characters. The first novella - quite short - follows Sheriff Holston as he must deal with the aftermath of his wife's Cleaning which then leads to his own. The second book features Holston's deputy, Marnes, and Jahns, the Mayor, as they travel into the depths of the Silo to find Holston's replacement. It also begins the reveal of the true reactionary force (and villain) in the Silo. Books three through five follow Juliette as she is plucked from the depths from Engineering and takes on the Sheriff's duties.<br /><br />Howey depicts quite a claustrophobic and grim lifestyle. I really found myself yearning yearning for daylight and sunshine along with some of the characters. Howey did a great job of fleshing out the details that really bring the novel world of the Silo to life.<br /><br />I'll definitely continue this series in the future.d from the depths from Engineering and takes on the Sheriff's duties.<br /><br />Howey depicts quite a claustrophobic and grim lifestyle.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie deserves more than 5 stars, if I could give 10 or 15 I wouldn't hesitate one second; it tells a powerful and timely story about the role of the father in the family. Having grown up in a family that had been split by divorce when I was 2 years old I have no remembrance of my parents ever living together. Living first with my mother and her parents and later with my mother and a step-father who resented my very existence I have no memory of a close relationship with a father figure. It would be difficult for me to evaluate what was missing from my life but it did leave a hole which is hard for me to define.<br /><br />The story is about five men, who are fathers in five distinctly different circumstances; four work as deputy sheriffs in Albany, Georgia and one is a carpenter/handyman. The ambience of the movie is very realistic and the viewer immediately feels thrust into the lives of these men as they deal with the challenges their lives present. The movie provides an opportunity to get to know the men and their families and develop a concern for them, their safety, and the personal problems with which they must deal.<br /><br />While there are some really cleverly funny moments, there are also moments of deep emotion which brought tears to my eyes. This is a movie that can touch deeply into the heart of the family in a realistic way and explore areas of fear and hope shared by most families. Three of the five men are supported by a strong Christian faith and demonstrate the sufficiency of their faith when sorely tested by circumstances. The other two are on roads to discovery with different outcomes for each of them.<br /><br />One of the strengths of this movie is the complete naturalness of each of the actors; it feels as if you're watching life in real time and somehow observing the lives of these individuals as they live them. This movie is a treasure for anyone who appreciates the value of the family and the faith centered life. It shows the rewards of faith and the penalties of bad decisions on both the individual and their families. This is one movie that every Christian family should have in their collection. I also recommend it for all who see the family as the foundation for a strong, cohesive society.of faith and the penalties of bad decisions on both the individual and their families.

B0059XTU1S|4.0|UPDATE (4/24/2013): This blu-ray disc does NOT contain a digital copy. It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.<br /><br />First, a disclaimer:<br /><br />I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).<br /><br />With that said, here are some of my thoughts:<br /><br />STORY/BOOK ADAPTATION<br /><br />I'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).<br /><br />Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.<br /><br />My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.<br /><br />I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.<br /><br />Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb,with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.<br /><br />Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.<br /><br />***END SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/ACTING<br /><br />I generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the \\"Took\\" (adventurous) and \\"Baggins\\" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.<br /><br />With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.<br /><br />The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.<br /><br />I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS<br /><br />Generally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.<br /><br />However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.<br /><br />The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />The Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.

B004U8VWLE|1.0|The idea of an artist's transformation into her art to the point of madness makes for great story telling. This movie aspires to that but fails on all counts. The acting is inconsistent and even cheesy at points. But the script is so bad that one can't solely blame the actors. The script is often confusing as it moves from reality to the inner workings of the main character's mind. It is also pretentious in its attempt to be \\"deeply psychological\\" when it is nothing more that a series of offensive charicatures--the cruel, immoral ballet master, the psychologically fragile ballerina, the over-sexed,drug and drink bad girl, the oppressive stage mother. . . need I go on? The unnecessary use of pornographic sexual references (e.g., masturbation, lesbian sex, hook-up heterosexual sex)as if only sex is at the heart of madness--how many times does the viewer have to see someone's hand reaching for a crotch? And, for a movie about a ballet dancer, why, oh why, couldn't any real dance be shown? Honestly, couldn't a real dancer have been caste for this movie? The only good thing I can say is that the music was fabulous. In many scenes elements of the score of Swan Lake was used masterfully, it's just too bad that the rest of the production didn't rise to that level. In any case, don't waste your time by renting this movie. Oh, and the use of the \\"shaky camera\\" with multiple-never-ending close-ups nearly drove me into madness. Stay away from this film!

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|A science fiction/fairytale with a strong female protagonist and a handsome prince. It’s a fun start to what looks to be very popular and exciting young adult series.<br /><br />About:  In a future world, plague is ravaging the population and everyone lives in fear of being it’s next victim. The main character, Cinder, is a teenage cyborg - a human with artificial and computerized body parts, including a too small artificial foot that she is self conscious about and has had since she was ten. Sadly, as a cyborg, Cinder is not considered entirely human in this society and has very few rights. So the story starts with a special and discriminated against main character.<br /><br />She lives in what is now considered New Beijing with her unkind stepmother, two step sisters (one is evil and one nice), and a sweet robot helper. She works as a mechanic - the best in the overpopulated city. She is the forced provider for her family, though her stepmother allots her only a closet sized room and dirty oil stained clothes. Cinder however, while berated in her home and society, is reasonably comfortable in her less-than-human place in this future world’s hierarchy. Life is looking up since she has found a replacement for her too small foot and there is to be a coronation for the local prince with a ball to celebrate. When Cinder meets the prince unexpectedly (he needs help with a broken android) it appears as if the Prince likes her.<br /><br />As things become complicated and drama ensues, it becomes clear that Cinder may be a factor in saving their world.<br /><br />Thoughts:  This is a sweet and fun story and I just loved Cinder. She is imperfect and smart and stands up for herself. She works hard and gets beyond the grease and grime and does something of value other than fix her hair and make-up. She also has the gumption to tell off some evil and unkind people in the story, creating some excellent dialog that teens will love. Me too – it kept me rooting for this character.<br /><br />I listened to this book in audio as well as read bits here and there. It was done very well with the reader having a strong and pleasant voice, which helps make an audio book listenable for me. It’s an interesting and surprising take on the original fairytale, with some unusual twists, a strong and smart heroine, some interesting science, and paranormal aspects, all of which kept me happily reading/listening. The only negative aspect for this story is that it’s a cliff hanger – so if you read this book you will most likely be sucked into the rest of the series. Sad thing is that you will have to wait for the next several books in the series as this was just released. Nevertheless, it’s a great book for young adults and adults that love teen reads; a fun one too! In my opinion this sci-fi-ish fairytale re-working gets a 4.5 star rating.aracter.<br /><br />I listened to this book in audio as well as read bits here and there.

B008G59IBI|3.0|The setlist on Tre! offers nothing interesting or compelling to legitamize the decision to make this a trilogy outing. In fact, Tre! limps along from the beginning without finding its footing or establishing a departure from the first 2 installments. This is a really boring disc with little distinguishing features. Perhaps the brightest spot comes from \\"Dirty Rotten B******\\", which returns them to the epic song format they've advanced since \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". Altogether, they sound like they've exhausted themselves here. This is easily the weakest of the bunch. From here, I suppose I'll begin assembling the best tracks from the 3 albums into my own setlist. Sadly, it might take quite an effort finding the standout tracks on Tre!

I struggled with my weight from the time I was a little girl 7/8 years old till recently. I also struggled with bouts of constipation, diarrhea, and gas that may be deemed lethal. This was extremely embarrassing over the years. I was diagnosed with IBS several years ago, and then in 2008/2009 I started to gain weight uncontrollably no matter how little I ate or exercised. I was diagnosed pre-diabetic at 38. I started seeing Doctor for my weight issue (which my insurance did not pay for) he put my on an extremely low carb diet I lost 50 pounds in 10 months. I am a 5 foot female that was at 175 pounds who has been able to keep the weight off for over 19 months - I only have issues when I slide back in to old habits. It's just so amazing to me that half of my family genetically speaking suffers from Diabetes and the other struggled with morbidly obesity and I am sure that it is due to \\"wheat\\" we are not tolerant of it! We are completely eliminating wheat from the house after the holiday (I can't do that dramatic change to my kids at Christmas it is the only time of the year I bake !) Then it is reading label and cleaning out the pantry! Since I personally have reduced carbs in my diet it should be too hard, my family may have an adjustment period but in the long run I know that this will be so much healthier for them. I am so excited I wish I wasn't waiting till after the holiday.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I really don't feel the need to say anything more, except Fringe is my absolute favorite show and I am so glad I purchased the DVDS to have forever. Really sad there is only 5 seasons! :(
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have watched this series and I love it!  As its predecessors it adds to this great T.V. Series and doesn't take away anything at all.  Great show, great DVDs, and I'm waiting now for Season 11.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Seriously, everyone should watch this show. It is my favorite show ever, and I'm so glad I now own all the seasons on DVD. So sad it's ending. :(
B004YM6JI2|5.0|&#34;The Seventh Season of Supernatural,&#34; is everything I've been waiting for, a reall great action adventure with a supernatural twist!  Simply terrific!
B0002TJGQS|4.0|They worked okay initially but not for very long. Don't know if it was just an old batch but no matter as the seller resolved the issue promptly by replacing the batch with fresh ones & they still work great! SOLD!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I purchased this a a gift for someone special, and she has told me she really loves it.  So there, another great movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is quite challenging, with lots of unexpected twists and turns. It will keep you occupied for many hours of puzzle solving fun. Be prepared to think outside the box.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I have all of the series on Spatacus now and I'm waiting for the new one to come out.  If you like action and drama this is for you.  Once you begin watching it you won't be able to walk away.  I rate this series a GREAT, with more to come.
0307887960|4.0|I got a lot out of this book, lost 21 lbs in a short period of time, though I've gained some back (my fault).  The diet was sensible for me, and fairly easy to follow.  Motivation plays a big part!
B005M5PENG|5.0|I wanted to see the pilot of the series.  I am a writer and lately I've been up to my ears in being busy, and I have missed a lot of the episodes of the New Hawaii Five O.  I watched it on my laptop, and I was amazed with it, and I'm sure many others will too.  I am interested in buying the series now.  I know I won't be disappointed either.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Loved it!  Love the new cd, great music!  It would make a great Christmas gift for someone who is a music lover!
0470474874|5.0|Excellent for beginners to pros - brings you up to speed with the new version.  The included CD helps a lot. Even if you buy the Kindle version you can call them and get the CD mailed to you. I would advise you to call them before you purchase the Kindle version to make sure they are still doing this.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have always loved hidden object games. This one is very different. Having the monkey go get things for you is so adorable. Love it!
B00005AQF7|5.0|I have always liked Snoop Dogg.  This was actually one of my favorites of his. He is somewhat of a pioneer in rap music.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw the documentary, Searching for Sugar Man and wanted to get the CDs quickly.  Coming from Reality arrived quickly and it is of good quality.
B009JBZH54|5.0|ALL THE DARK KNIGHT MOVIES ON BLUE RAY IN A GREAT COLLECTION. GREAT VALUE!!! GREAT GIFT!!! THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION FOR ANY MOVIE BUFF...
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing Searching for Sugar Man, I wanted to get Sixto Rodriguez's music right away.  The CD arrived quickly and was in good condition and I am enjoying listening to it.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|I loved the top notch special effects.  I saw how California would slide into the ocean, a super volcano explode, and an ocean break over the Alps.  Good acting, fast paced movie.  I probably would have given it 5 stars but I took one star away  because I don't think anybody would stop in the middle of an epic emergency to explain it all to his kids no matter how much he loves them,  before acting to save their butts.  Still, I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great game a good way to unlock other games and win coins every game gets better and you have achievements to complete
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I can't believe I got suckered into buying this move. Worst movie ever. Watching grass grow is more exciting than this movie.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|All received in great condition.  Entertaining...looking forward to MW taking over.  Like the series.  Effects were great.  I would recommend to anyone who likes sci fi
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book is not for the average reader.  I am college educated and yet still had trouble understanding some of the vocabulary.  I wish he had included more information about the actual experience.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Best show ever, wish i had started reading the graphic comic prior to the show.  Show does good job of introducng new characters.
B008MZPVP4|4.0|I like it better than other down material. Not overly produced but not a garage recording either.  The drums sound awesome.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This is without a doubt Rise Against's best album. Almost every song is amazing and although some songs take away from the pacing they are still great songs and The Sufferer & The Witness is Rise Against's best album.
B000F8O35U|5.0|When I recieved this dvd my granddaughters were excited to watch it with Nona.  It was in Excellent condition!  Thanks!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books I have ever read. The characters are beautifully human and relatable, as are the situations. This book made me both laugh and cry and I can't wait to reread it!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I was very glad to get this dvd.  I like to collect the Disney Classics.  I know my grand kids will enjoy watching it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I love this story and its characters. Can't wait to see what happens next! Must read!!!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Love this move.  It's a great follow up the the IM2, Thor & Cap Amer movies.  Looking forward to the next in the series.
0140177396|5.0|It's just what my son needed for school! They are reading it now. Funny thing, I also found this book in Walmart, and it was the same price as what I spent through Amazon.
B009186JYI|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the early Stones in the small venues being extremely talented without the huge productions and legions of road crews and handlers.  Just a blast!  Keith was and still is amazing!
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|This movie is a true testament to the power Mark Wahlberg must wield in Hollywood.  It's hard to imagine a less funny, more poorly written script.  The acting is wooden.  The premise and direction are just hacky, and calling it predictable would be to intellectualize it beyond its merit (maybe you have to be from Boston to be dumb enough to think this is funny).  I like goofy profane humor -- Anchorman and its progeny are hysterical.  This is not goofy, profane funny.  It's a marketing vehicle for harvesting cash from fools.  If I could think of a more descriptive way of expressing my dislike for this POS I would post it here.
B00000IZOR|5.0|Great toy for the kids to just drag around and act like they're on the phone. The car phone enhances the kids motor skills and definitely keeps them entertained.<br /><br />Perfect for gifts and has reasonable price.
B0079K4WEE|4.0|This film is slow but it is meant to be because it is an elegy to the loss of the senses, one by one.  Two beautiful people fall in love when this begins worldwide,  The order of loss is smell, taste, hearing, vision.  The beautiful thing this film does is that as each sense is loss there is a renewed but brief celebration of the sense or senses left. The world is also ending.  There is no reason discernible for any of this,<br /><br />This is one of many end of the world films or books which have come forth in the some number in the last few years,  There seems to be almost no interest in depicting us being overtaken by aliens and sent to oblivion by them. No, this is the end of our world on earth as given by each writer's take on now it will occur,  Although the woman is a doctor working in illness outbreak, she is unable to prove that this is any dissease.<br /><br />Another clever aspect is that each loss is preceded by some wild emotional outburst.  The smell one is preceded by fits of sobbing.  The hearing one starts with a fit of rage.  I found it fascinating that an avalanche of emotion heralded each loss.<br /><br />This film grows on you,  The first twenty minutes passes very, very slowly but if you stick with it, you will find yourself pulled into it.<br /><br />As an added benefit, Ewan McGregor and Eva Green in the lead roles, have to be two of the most gorgeous people on the planet.  Louis CK recently did a comedy act where he said that he'd been a heterosexual all of his forty plus years.  However, he recently met Ewan MacGregor and found himself just mesmerized by how beautiful he was.  Finally he concluded that even he could turn gay briefly if it meant he could have Ewan!<br /><br />I think the movie is great if you can hang in there through the very slow start.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Like many people I followed the production of what was initially announced as an Alien prequel with great interest and, when it was no longer an Alien prequel, with some confusion. It's fair to say that my and others expectations were set too high.<br /><br />But let's look at reality for a moment. There were only two good Alien movies. Namely Alien and Aliens. Everything since then has been a creative failure. Partly that's because the alien xenomorph itself is the epitome of a one note villain. There's really nothing extra to explore. No motivations, no morals.<br /><br />Prometheus is in many ways an attempt to move onto fresh ground and maybe find out what else there is to see in this universe.<br /><br />At it's core Prometheus is a simple movie. Much like Alien and Aliens before it, there's a very basic action/horror premise in a remote and isolated location.. And when it focuses on that it works.<br /><br />But the problem is that Prometheus desperately wants to be more. It's a creation tale. It's a moral about biological weapons. It's about faith. And all of that really weighs down the early parts of the movie.<br /><br />It's trying to do so many things at once, that several of the characters really never get the development they deserve.<br /><br />But for all that, once it gets going it really never lets up. There are some strong central characters (particularly Michael Fassbender's android) that are easily capable of carrying the action forward. The visuals are, naturally, stunning. And it does carry a lot of the feel of the original Alien movie.<br /><br />So a qualified success then. I just wish it hadn't taken itself quite so seriously.
B008XG1X18|4.0|If you have a family, if you have hobbies you enjoy then you might want to pass up Pinterest because it is ADDICTIVE.  Once you begin pinning you won't have time (or desire) to spend time with family or scrapbooks, knitting or golf.  Go ahead, become a Pinner.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
1435114949|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is best read in the complete and this book gives the entire Doyle-world, set in leather binding so that it can be read and read again, as all good Sherlock tales must be. It is simple and in easily-read print and a perfect gift for anyone not yet initiated to the wonders of Sherlock's world. Also a great gift for hardcore Sherlock fans. Holds well in the hand.
B006LR0XLM|1.0|Caused all sorts of problems with my Galaxy SII.<br />Gave it a couple weeks & realized it was more problem than it was worth.<br />Uninstalled it from smartphone & computer.<br />Good Riddance.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am playing this game on my kindle fire and it works great. I have not had any problems playing the game on here.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Never thought I'd give up pen & paper but I have.  Evernote is handy, works well, dependable.  Not as crazy about the most recent update.  The changes were mostly cosmetic & I just don't like the looks as much, but it doesn't impact the usability.  I like the ability to sort my notes into Notebooks.  Really handy for organizing all the aspects of a busy life.
1451695195|4.0|There is a lot of technical wording, most not completely unknown, but, while trying to get the meaning of these medical words put into the point Eben is trying to make, one must read and reread and some of the meaning of the subject is lost.  This would be and excellent book to give to a Dr. or someone with that kind of medical knowledge.<br />I did enjoy his view of exploring heaven however the meaning of these technical words do get in the way.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I absolutely love Diana Krall's work, but I really wish that she had never released this CD. I listened to it once and put it away. She is my favorite female musician and I listen to her other CDs constantly. This one, however, will never get played by me again.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I like the Castle TV show, and enjoy the books. The differences are minor, though I miss the dynamic of the father daughter relationship we see in the show.
B0091LS0BU|1.0|I love Paul McCarney's work and I particularly love Diana Krall's work, but this is a recording that never should have been made.
1416549447|4.0|Supplies the essentials of chi running. I have found it to be a useful book, especially in conjunction with the dvd on chi running.
B0006213WG|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  It offers a unique blend of skater punk and alternative metal that blends into a sound that is not really comparable to any other band.  There are also some heart wrenching and sentimental songs that show the bands versatility.  Key tracks are \\"No Reason,\\" \\"Bitter End,\\" and \\"Pieces,\\" but every song is epic and flows well together overall.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Even better than the movie-could not put it down. Riveting, vivid,intelligent read with even more vivid and captivating characters. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!
0345529057|5.0|i fell in love with this book series. so much anticipation, twists & turns in the story plot. you really get attached to each and every character.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love this box set. I have watched every thing on all nine discs and enjoyed every second. A lot more stuff than I thought I was buying. Great buy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it...... it is so fun.....I just love it. it doesn't give me even. truble. that is why I love it
B008G8SFGO|2.0|I can say that Hell Or Hallelujah, Wall of Sound, Long Way Down & The Devil is Me are good songs & were enough to bump this up to a 2nd star. However, as was the case with Sonic Boom it has a fraudulent feeling behind it. Did they hire Eric for his ability to sound like Peter when singing? Did they hire Tommy for his ability to play in Aces style? It sure looks like it except these guys are happy with one song per album. An imitation is still an imitation no matter how close it is. Egos & greed have taken over & I'm personally sick of hearing all 4 of the original members talk trash on each other. I'll pass on the $4,000 companion book as well, thanks anyway. It was time to say goodby when they said \\"farewell\\" back in 2001! Where does it end? Will we soon be exposed to an official \\"KISS\\" touring the country in make-up with no original members? I'd like to hear Tommy playing in his own style instead of trying to sound like Ace during his solos. He sounded nothing like Ace when he was in Black N Blue. If I want to hear Ace I'll listen to Ace.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I highly recommend reading this series . I have read a lot of sci-fi and found this to be refreshing concept in the genre ..
B00000AFDW|2.0|I gotta be honest. I really liked this album until I found out how Ace & Peter were cast aside during recording of it. I've sold my copy of it. At one point KISS became KI$$ corp. They've always been about clever marketing but there was a legitimate feel behind it. I don't know if it's changed or if I just finally started to notice. Whatever the reason, I have no need for this album. Too much fighting among the original members has ruined it for me, too much greed & ego.
B00785P2QC|4.0|sometimes im playing and leave but when i come back my game it set back before the last time i played...
B00AECGQF2|4.0|plz make a toca boca hair salon for free I am so sad please if you hear this I will be happy thank you for hearing this my child is cry for this if you do this. bless you
B008FRFN7A|1.0|It said it worked for non eprint printers. It doesn't. It did not work for office jet pro 8500 premier. Now it is stuck on my cloud and I will never use it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN UP WITH 20 WORDS.  I GOT THE SECOND KINDLE AND IT WORKS GREAT.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS LEARNING HOW TO DOWNLOAD THINGS AND STILL AM UNABLE TO GET THE CORRECT TIME ON THE DEVICE.  EVEN THE NEW ONE. THE ONLY OTHER THING OR ISSUE WOULD BE THE BRIGHT SCREEN TO READ, AFTER A FEW HOURS READING YOUR EYES ARE STILL SEEING THE BRIGHTNESS.  EVERTHING CAME WITH THE KINDLE NO TROUBLE GETTING STARTED AND THE FOLKS AT AMAZON WERE VERY HELPFUL WHEN I NEEDED ANYTHING.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The team does not disappoint and all Criminal Minds fans will happily watch it again and again.  Can't wait for the next one
141659521X|5.0|I like the character in the book and the story kept with the same theme as the characters other stories.<br />Good story
0375826742|5.0|Without sleaze and too much darkness, a wonderful tale of personal development and heroism.  A fine choice for any and all,young or not
1451695187|5.0|You will have a realization  then confirmation that everything you ever wanted to believe about heaven is very real. Open this book and read it, then close the debate on heaven.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Why is this series so excellent?  Is it because the team is so efficient at being aware of each other?  Whatever reason, it never seems to fall down.
B00ALGW286|4.0|A sweet coming of age story of four teenagers in Moscow during the 1991-1992 changes in politics. Wonderful YA fiction, good reading for anyone interested in the New Russia, worth a few hours of your time.
B001UE27X8|5.0|What a joy to hear these two superb musicians doing full justice to an array of beautiful music selections.  &#34;You Must Remember Spring&#34; is superb, and sung way too infrequently by jazz singers these days.
B00005JKTF|5.0|This is something I have been looking for this for a long time. I am glad to own it now.
B0042ETJU2|5.0|Crisp, with nice image depth in BluRay, and breathtakingly spacious in DTS surround sound. The Extras and new commentary tracks are revealing, except perhaps for McTiernan's rather bored and distracted ramble on the first one. But a great value on this set.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|was not expecting such a good time watching ted.<br />Good story.... good acting and actors.<br />really recommend this movie to anyone that likes originality and any of Seth MacFarlane's work.<br /><br />From start to finish this movie got me hooked, not 1 second of it was boring.<br /><br />Really enjoyed it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is an amazing book that will cause you to take sides and hate characters you loved. It really messes with your head.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just purchased and received the CD of The Piano Guys this week, fantastic!! They did a wonderful job on this album, I have listened to it several times since receiving it. Truly talented artists, you won't go wrong in purchasing this.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|amazing book!  if you loved the movie, this is a must read.  much more detail into the story of statistics in baseball.  i am not an intense fan (rarely watch games)... but this book is very interesting and a super story.. can't wait to finish reading
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love aliens movies, the blue-ray with the added scenes is great. Nice box set, Couldn't get better. Want avp would be nice
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Got this item quickly and it does a good job protecting my Fire.  Nothing negative to say about it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My favorite game on my kindle fire hd. Only suggestion would be purchasable extra gadget slots. It stinks having to choose which gadget  I want when there are  only two slots!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy this book as much as I did. Can not wait to read the next one !
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Not only longer, but more in the series.  I didn't see the truncated Firefly series when it first broadcasted but became hooked when one of our Sci-Fi cable channels broadcasted several episodes. Hope Whedon decides to do more, however, with more emphasis on the cowboy-in-space charm the original series had. After all, that was the basis of hits like Star Trek ... wagon train to the stars.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome game for girls and bronies! If anything in this world of RTSC games could of come at a better time for Xmas, this sure as well takes the pony cake!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Didn't see the series when it was originally broadcasted. The digital remastering was top-notch though there are certain things I would quibble with the digital decision makers.<br /><br />I like the fact both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions included a couple episodes that never aired. I look forward to the day when Whedon can continue lensing a full season's worth of episodes, preferably with the same actors maybe set ten years down the road. Either that or digital technology gets to the point where digital actors could be generated to create a virtual domain of new episodes. Don't know if I said that right.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|GET THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. Unless you don't like books.... A MUST READ!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love this set ! The only thing I don't like is that if you're not careful getting the disks out of its case you can easily scratch them ! Other than that, it's perfect (:
0374214913|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this. It was a cool combination of bookstore, secrets, computer nerds, an interesting cast of characters, and fast -moving plot.. If you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary, give this one a try.
B009B8YZIK|1.0|My husband and I love the Halo games.  He watched the entire Forward Unto Dawn series when 343 put it up on the web as free videos for their fans.  Once they realized it was successful, they decided to release it on BluRay.  I have no problem with this, but then they PULLED ALL BUT THE FIRST TWO EPISODES offline!!  This series was promised to Halo fans everywhere as a FREE webseries.  It is very disappointing that 343 would renege on their promise like this.  They are a terrible company, and do NOT deserve your financial support.  If we hadn't already bought Halo 4, we would return it.  There are enough honest companies out there, why give your business to one that is just out to take advantage of the fans it should be catering to?
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|Installed on my kindle 8.9. Works well and saves the photos to the photos gallery. I also played with the different adjustments for the camera and the panorama shot but haven't used yet. Love the zoom feature and video options. Downloaded the free visual guide app also available on Amazon to learn how to use the app. Very happy with this app.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|this game is really really great -- the controls are very responsive and the music just ROCKS! I would def recommend it for anyone
B000VWYNNW|5.0|After getting stoked with the new live cd Celebration Day, i decided to go back to the original.  Its sounds just as great as it did growing up.  Slow dancing to Stairway to Heaven at the end of your make out party, Awe the joys of youth.  The remasters sound incredible! Enjoy
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I've had this movie for years in cassette, and I'm so glad to replace it with a brand new DVD.  it arrived in perfect condition, brand new, and in just a few days from my order.  Thank you!
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|This was another great build. Took a while to do, but it was fun. The only complaint and why I gave it only 4 stars is because the bags aren't labeled. You have to open all of the bags in order to build as you go. The other 2 I bought at the same time had labeled bags. Much easier to build. Other than that, it was a great build and has a lot of cool features!
0786891416|5.0|This book is a Christmas gift for my husband. I chose this rating because I love the television show Castle and feel that if this book follows that format, it will be a good one.<br /><br />Although I understand Amazon's need for feedback, this time of year it would be much better to wait until AFTER the holiday to send e-mails to request that feedback since many purchases are gifts. You will get a much truer idea of the review and not put your customers in the awkward position of having the person the gift was intended for coming across the e-mail. Many families share the same e-mail addresses.
B005VPRG10|5.0|It was a great simple build. Bags were labeled and the instructions were clear and accurate. All of the pieces were there and it was fun to build.
0307951529|5.0|As a big fan of Chris Guillebeau for a couple of years now, I absolutely loved his latest book. Full of inspiring stories and practical information you can actually use to start your own business, you won't want to put this book down.<br /><br />The day after I read it, I started my own business - it's the best thing I've ever done, and I can thank Chris (and this book!) for the helpful push.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|i loved the first two books. the third and fourth books were ok. this book number five was terrible. i really do not care how characters broke their fast which is so boring who they sat next too even dumber and what they were wearing the ultimate in stupidity. i already know if there is a book six i will not buy it. so much unresolved you know the author is banking on book six. i would rather use my own imagination and complete this epic saga myself. this series could have been so much better than it is.
0525953728|5.0|A definitely true account of what our military continues to do! We need to continue to support our TROOPS TO THIS DAY AS THEY ARE STILL IN HARMS WAY!  GOD BLESS OUR UNITED STATES AND OUR VETERANS AND CURRENT MILITARY THAT IS IN HARMS WAY.<br />I am a military mom. js
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Dissappointed In John Travoltas's Role. He Disn't Add Anything To The Movie. Any Actor Could Have Played His Part.<br />Otherwise The Acting Was OK. Great Story
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I love Tom cruise movies, this one is for me the most great action movie, seen him hanging from that tall building give me goosebumps
0316017930|5.0|Different slant on a lot of things.  I gave it to my daughter to see what she thinks.  I am a big fan of Wollender.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|My son loves this movie. Only complaint is that some of the scenes seem more adult-appropriate. Of course my child doesn't get this, but the movie would still be better without it.
0099580578|5.0|Whether you are a man or woman, this book is an awesome read! If you've heard about women reading this and would like to know all the hype about it, read them all.  You'll be glad you did.  It is not Sadistic like some people think it is.  It should help you in the bedroom too.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I enjoyed reading it but had it figured out quickly. It kept me up reading half the night regardless, as I had to k now how it would unfold. The end was too fast, too tidy.
1582701709|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  I've read it more than once, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
1451695195|5.0|I love hearing about people that have gone to heaven, every story is different except for one thing, the love they feel from the Father and that we can be forgiving for anything we have done, all we need to do is ask.

B000683VI4|5.0|Ryan Gosling i love. I got this movie and it is really a wonderful love story full of emotion real sexual love. I can't explain just how this movie touches me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book is a perfect example of adventure and complete excitement I can't wait to read mocking Jay
B00005OMTT|3.0|I heard the one song on my radio station here and new it was old but I really liked it. I love the sounds of Tibetian type chants and this song had that to me. I love Catholic chanting but I am not Catholic. Just enjoyed the song I did like and a couple others.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Upgraded to Blu ray! Awesome ! The price was amazing, and I got it in 2 days! B<br />Uh this now
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Only bought because after upgrading from win 7 pro to win 8 pro, the old 353 not being recognized. BONUS: win 8 pro voice is male, win 7 is female. Win 8 is VERY easy to understand, not &#34;WTF did she say?&#34; with win 7 and the 353. Also, the S4 is VERY accurate on positioning, +/- 3 feet give or take .5 feet. Works well, obtains satellite lock with-in 5 seconds.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|I find North Korea fascinating so have read quite a bit on it, but expect that even a reader with no more background than enjoying the Kim Jong Il puppet in &#34;Team America: World Police&#34; would find this book accessible and worthwhile. Drawing on extensive interviews from those who have escaped North Korea, Remick provides rare, very human insights on life in this bizarre nation, rather than discussing the geopolitical issues in great detail. Having recently re-read &#34;1984&#34;, I was struck by how this book shows the stunning parallels between the world Orwell feared could emerge from totalitarianism ideology and an actual 21C society. Little wonder &#34;1984&#34; was the favourite novel of one of the defectors in &#34;Nothing to Envy&#34;.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This is SUCH a cool flick. Highly recommended. The ending is perfect, unlike so many other movies with crap endings.
0316017922|5.0|I haven't read other Gladwell books but from what I've heard, he's rather hit and miss. This is definitely a hit, starting with the excellent analysis of why so many ice hockey stars seem to be born early in the year and moving on to easy to read but insightful discussion of success in a range of fields. It's never boring, not a word wasted but is worth the price of purchase alone for the chapter titled &#34;The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes&#34;, which is about as stunning a chapter as I've read in non-fiction. I won't give away anything on that theory, just read it for yourself; it is truly fascinating.
B009E3EY38|4.0|Nice performance for the most part......some parts were a little weak for the Mighty Zep....Bonhams son did quite well in his dad's place !!!!
0307951529|5.0|I have given two copies of this book as gifts, to friends who are fledgling \\"solopreneurs\\" to inspire them and give them some concrete advice on how to start and build a business. It's a good read even if you do not aspire to become a $100 startup.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Although the lead is not as convincing as the original spartacus he does grow on you after a few hours.The story as well isn't quite as exciting as the first one it is good enough to give it 4 stars.
1857885082|3.0|This book borrows a lot from Jilly Cooper's 1970s classic, Class, a hugely funny look at the different social classes in England. The format, as well as many of Fox's observations on how the English behave, dress, work, decorate their homes, worship and so on are rehashed from Cooper's early book.<br /><br />Still, there are some nice observations here such as the subtle, Ingmar Bergman film rigmarole of English people waiting to be served at a pub.<br /><br />Another comment is that most of these observations apply largely to the English in the home counties and the less multi-cultural parts of London. People in the remoter provinces can be rather salty and earthier in their customs.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad book, that will appeal for anyone who likes to observe English culture in all its little strange subtleties and ironies.
B002F3BOS2|5.0|Although there are many pretenders out there who claim their 180 gm.vinyl sounds great and they sound crap,a real rip off,this is not one of them.A true audiophile gem.The sound is transparent ,full not bloated,I can't say enough about the music and sound quality.+++++.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i use twitter everyday and i absolutely love it very much so i loved this product very very much ~
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Please deactivate vibration function. Then it would get 5 stars!!! Too noisy with it. Otherwise  this app is one of my all time favorites.HTC EVO 3D.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Oddly enough for an action movie the relationship between the two main characters was the most original and refreshing part. It was a very subdued and was limited to touching of the hands. Which I really liked this in contrast to the typical \\"mid film he bangs the sexy girl\\" scenes that are so typical. Everything else was richly done but this was the most striking.
B00A5052YE|4.0|I was unsure about getting this album. But after reading reviews and listening to some tracks online, I decided to. This one is different from her earlier offerings like \\"As I Am\\" and \\"Songs in A Minor\\". These songs speak of the growth she has undoubtedly gone through. Take time to listen to the lyrics,especially in \\" Brand New Me\\" and \\"Not Even the King\\". My gripe with the album is the inclusion of the Inferno Version of \\"Girl on Fire\\" with Nicki Minaj, I would have preferred the Main Version of the Song. Do yourself a favour and download the \\"Bluelight version\\" of \\"Girl on Fire\\". It's slower, more sultry and mellow, showcasing her soulful side. A playlist without the rap version sounds much better to me. The tag team effort with Maxwell on \\"Fire We Make\\" is a winner! His vocals are the spark that set this one ablaze. Other standout tracks include \\"Tears Always Win\\",\\"That's When I Knew\\" whose lyrics come across as very heartfelt and \\"Listen to Your Heart\\" which has a feel-good retro vibe that's a joy to listen to.  \\"Limitedless\\" and \\"New Day\\" both have a booming bass reminiscent of club songs. The ballads \\"101\\" and \\"One thing\\" are real treasures. After the song \\"101\\", there's some kind of interlude where she chants \\"Hallelujah\\" with the music rising to a crescendo, I did wish this was a full song. For those who don't like \\"Girl On Fire\\" at first, give it another listen it does grow on you. A slow burn but still a good album.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This well rated app is a ton of fun the whole point of the game is style and create new hair styles you can  even dye your customets hair into a funky new hairsyle so have fun with your new app bye
1848581777|5.0|The story's great and a classic and one I read every year, but having it in hardback and a replica of its first publication makes that much more special to me. I love reading this story during the Christmas Holidays.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I loved this book!! I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 13 just because the crash scene is a little disturbing. This is one of the best books I have ever read even though its sad.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent read, could not put it down!  Will be purchasing book two this instant and eagerly await book three.  Follet has captivated readers worldwide once again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|You can not see which city the hourly is for. The ads are right on top of the city name.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Not what i was looking for. And got a lot of advertisements on my phone shortly after downloading this game.
B006IS6CK0|4.0|A classic movie. It's so refreshing to watch a film with no filler or wasted scenes, yet the story never feels rushed and the actors all perform beautifully.  I'm not familiar with John Ford's other works but the direction style here reminded me of &#34;The African Queen&#34; and &#34;Treasure of the Sierra Madres&#34; directed by John Huston in its elegance and deceptive simplicity.  I wasn't expecting the beautiful landscape and wildlife footage or that the African people would be depicted so naturally.  I really like all the lead actors, Gable, Gardner, and Grace Kelly, but had put off seeing this film because I assumed there would be some racism in the depictions of the African people.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised on that point.  There's no cartoonish racism, and except for the white men calling the african men &#34;boys&#34; and their assumption that the white men will get the credit & reward for the Africans' labor (capturing the wild animals) no other racism.  The sound track of actual Africans singing their own music is simply beautiful.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|First off, I loved the movie! A great story, stellar acting, and amazing set pieces made for a wonderful movie experience!<br /><br />My only very minor complaint is that the bonus feature (The Journey Of Bruce Wayne) was too short, running at less than 10 minutes. The only way to get the real bonus features was to buy the Blu-Ray/DVD combo, a more pricier buy (along with the fact that I do not own a Blu-Ray player).<br /><br />Wonderful movie, although I wish it had more bonus material.
B005ONTD42|3.0|expect alot more for a product that cost hunder of dollars. Luckily i only bought a used one, if i had bought a brand new one for $300 , i would have been upset
B0017I1FP8|5.0|No one can capture the essence of Christopher Nolan's &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; perfectly except for Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard! The Joker's twisted soul, Harvey Dent's story, and the dark, hopeless atmosphere make for a wonderful musical score! Not a pretty score, but it was never made to be pretty.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|So far so good, I wish you could zoom in on some of the levels. Otherwise it's pretty fun and no glitches.
1608871045|5.0|This is a must-have for any fan of Nolan's Batman trilogy. All of the gadgets Batman uses in the movies are shown, explained (some with diagrams) and elaborated on. Batman's vehicles and Batcave are explained in-depth (with removable blueprints providing a nice touch), some basic Batman psychology is brought to light, and case files are included on many villians and heroes. Some wonderful props are thrown in as well, such as; the Joker's playing cards, &#34;I Believe in Harvey Dent&#34; campaign stickers, and many others.<br />Pricewise, buying it off amazon was a huge deal! I went to Barnes and Noble and saw the same book for $40! Here I purchased it for only $20. I highly recommend it to any Nolan Batman fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are a ton of great reviews about this series and DVD set, so no need to write another really. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. I just want to ask... How can they cancel this awesome series when they air garbage 90% of the time?
B004P7CNE0|4.0|Equilibrium was a surprisingly good movie. It does borrow elements from 1984 and other dystopian future stories, but it has a fairly good plot, good acting (Christian Bale) and some kick-ass fight scenes. Although overshadowed by other sci-fi blockbusters (ex. The Matrix), this is a good way to spend two hours. I recommend it to any sci-fi fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As always, the object search and puzzle games are a lot of fun. The graphics and storyline are wonderful.  G5 games are always a good buy.
B001NPDCFQ|1.0|Large portions of this, specifically all Judy Garland's singing, is missing. Very disappointing! The picture is grainy but considering when this was originally made I have no problem with picture quality but missing sound is not acceptable.
B008ADSDHQ|3.0|I have been an enthusiastic follower of Jo Nesbo for sometime. However, 'The Bat' did not provide the same absorbing story line as the subsequent novels showed. I would not recommend this book unless you are a confirmed Harry Hole fan. I had often wondered what had happened in the Australia segment as it was referred to in the subsequent novels.
B0085YNML2|5.0|The app is very professional in quality, and very entertaining to play. This blend of physics platformer and puzzler is quite unique and deserving of credit. I hope this developer releases packs of new levels, sequels, and different games, since I got this one for free.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The film is long on action but short on plot.....Anne Hathaway is one of the finest female actors of our time but her character drove me  batty.... Two stars for this overly long and sometimes unwatchable film....
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|if you are European, dont watch it. Its not funny, its stupid American humour... I really expected so much from this.
030758836X|2.0|I didn't care for all the graphic, weird sexual stuff. It stared feeling too tedious about the mid-point.  Just wanted it to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book but lots of killing. It is sad and the end is a cliff hanger. I hope to read the next book.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|It's a fun action/fiction movie and it's clean. If you're looking for a movie to entertain yourself and relax this is a good choice. It can be enjoyed with friends, family or even alone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good clean mindless fun for the entire family. The price is great. Wish I was playing for real coins but it's all good.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I was looking through the movie rentals for something new, and picked up this movie.  I fell head-over-heels in love with it and just had buy my own copy.  Such a great Christmas movie!  Looking forward to re-watching it for years to come.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is awesome it feels like real life mostly all I can say its awesome get it it is so awesome
B0089OBLDO|4.0|I bought this because I wanted to use my PS3 controller on my XBOX for fighting games and I can say that it works and it's easy to use.
0891419063|5.0|This book will put you on the front line of the fighting.....I've read a lot of war stories but this has to be the best.
034580404X|5.0|loved it....very entertaining and romantic. Hope E L James write another series I will buy it if she does. Very Very Good.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|A nice diversion. Keeps you going and adds enough real history for spice. The love story was a particularly moving touch.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|pop in and out as my busy schedule allows and I can still accomplish surprisingly a lot. I want to collect them all!
B001GXY92U|5.0|David Gray is  wonderful ! His Bach concertos are one of the best interpretations of Bach. I am very satisfied with this CD !
0062183591|5.0|As a student in the Master's in Science Fraud and Forensics Program at Carlow University [...], I have found that the author of The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, Mr. Dan Ariely, allows one to think about what may lead one to make particular decisions when it comes to honesty and the opportunities that may lead one to cheat. Within our class, Forensic Research and Analysis, it allows us to evaluate situations by asking questions of how does the chance of getting caught affect how likely we are to act dishonestly in order to gain an advantage?; Does religion improve our morality/honesty?; Does collaboration or conforming to a group lead us astray?   What I love about this book is that it brings critical thinking down to a human level as I find it easier to connect to his message(s) through his technique of using real-life stories or breaking down his observations in words not just statistics. I also found his description of brain structure to be comprehensible--giving one examples and visuals of how information is potentially processed which may lead to why we behave the way we do.   I would have liked to seen more information in how the social sciences connect with honesty. Although, he touches on some terminology that social scientists use but I would have liked to seen more of a connection. Is deviance real (absolutism)? or is deviance a label (relativism)? We know what he has observed and it makes sense, but how do we separate it out on a social science level?   Dan Ariely has changed the way I think on many levels-- I may anticipate the outcome of a situation or process details in a specific format; however, there could be so many other reasons and thought processes behind the actions of a person. It is important to not only absorb the situation at hand, but to truly understand the entire picture. Asking the proper questions is a critical piece of the puzzle.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Yes, some of the science is just awful.<br /><br />Totally: most of the decisions they make leading up to disaster are obviously poor ones.<br /><br />All those things make the stunningly beautiful movie, fun. Enjoy it. You don't need to seek some hidden meaning or modern day societal parallels to have a good time.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace makes the movie great. You'll even get past the fact that the dream child version of her speaks with a British/Aussie accent, and she does not. I promise. Life will go on for you. Very fun movie; not a lot of substance.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|The $100 Start Up is an inspiring guide to stepping out on your own, doing what you love, without fear, and ignoring naysayers. A great prompt to start expanding your comfort zone and really leading the life you want.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love to read. Sometimes I feel like I have read so many books, I hardly give any a five star review because everything becomes been there, done that. This is NOT the case for Hugh Howey's Wool series. The Omnibus collection is actually five shorter stories, but they all continue off of each other so it reads like one book. At the end of every mini book, I found myself SHOCKED by the ending. I could never tell how the story would end which was so refreshing. It has been a long time since my mouth has literally dropped open at a plot twist. I am a fan of Dystopian novels and this one is truly an original. I don't know if I have ever seen so many 5 star reviews for a book but I wanted to add mine because I can't say enough wonderful things about this series. Like many others, I fell victim to sleep deprivation because I couldn't put this book down! My sister and I would text each other all day and night as we read. \\"Can you believe what just happened??? What do you think will happen next???\\" I am hooked! This collection is Wool 1-5 but I would read up to Wool 1,000,000 and beyond. Yes, it's THAT good.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I'm a huge House fan.  We loved this final season.  Wish it was longer and wasn't 100% thrilled with the ending.  Maybe that's because I wish it hadn't ended
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Cute, funny! My son watched this several times and loved it. Lots of laughs and gets you in the Christmas spirit!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Saw this concert on tv. Had to own it. Sade is back after a 10 year layoff and better than ever!!! What a performance.I only wish I could have been there personally. But in my town we're lucky to get one of the Pips. Just imagine Ladies and gentlemen we present THE PIP. This ain't South Florida. Soooooo we buy lots of concert DVD's and watch you enjoy yourselves AT the concert. I won't see Sade unless her bus breaks down. Concert on I95.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. I'll probably read it again in a couple of weeks. The writing was as good as it gets and the story was perfectly paced. You will fall in love with the main character and find yourself laughing out loud.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|Some teams are magical in the movies. Like Tracy & Hepburn. Newman & Redford. Timmy & Lassie. Mel Gibson & Danny Glover were great together. 4 movies for the price of 1. Anybody out there wanna see Lethal Weapon 5?  Don't laugh .What is this Star Trek 30? Is it true they're bringing back the original cast for Star Trek the retirement home voyage?
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Haven't played game very long but I liked it enough to buy it. Hope my money was well spent. I love hidden object games with a story to it. I am sure I wont be disappointed.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie this is one of the best of the franchise. But we all know the theme songs of the Bond movies are stuff of legend. And the scenery during the opening theme. Some with established legendary singers and others create legends like Sheena Easton (for your eyes only).And still others revive careers like Lulu(to sir with love & the man with the golden gun). Let's see what happens with Adele. Here is an open question. Who would you most like to see perform James Bond's next theme song? I vote for Celine Dion.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|One of the great bands in my opinion. This is a great purchase and delivered promptly. Nothing to be disappointed about with this buy!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I love hidden picture games.  They are a grate way to waist time.  This game has that pluse more.  It is definitely ment for a large screen. Playing it on my phone makes it a hell of a lot more difficult, but still fun.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|What can I say? I am a fan of Phil and watched him all the wway through the American Idol series. Great guy and great sound. Excellent CD!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|The movie was not funny and rather stupid, not sure why Barbara Walters said it was one of the funniest movies this year .
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Got this for another family member and she apparently found it to be a good read. Haven't read it myself, but will take her word for it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works great with variety of choices for decks and play...great standby.  Better than trying to play 52 card pickup in the airport.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|great flick. its a little cheesy but its got some good blues in it. the slide guitar is good considering its karate kid
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I have read this numerous times over the years and am amazed every time.  To think that the words of a 14 year old girl can be so inspiring.
B0085X31VE|5.0|I had never heard of this band when I found the album in my local Zia Records, but something about it said \\"yes... yes... pay the full price; you won't regret it\\" so I did.  I haven't stopped to listening to it in over 3 months.<br /><br />The band is from Australia, and they are a progressive death metal band.  They're unusual tho in that they have 2 vocalists and a violinist in their ranks.  One of the vocalists handles the growly CMVs and the other has one of the clearest voices I've ever heard in metal; somehow he manages to avoid sounding saccharine tho.  The violin is NOT used sparingly, and manages to not only fit in but at times to control the melody and pacing of the music.  It's mind-blowingly awesome to hear this band traverse from guttural pounding to chamber music and back again, sometimes in the space of just a few seconds.<br /><br />The band apparently spent 5 years perfecting this music, and I do mean perfecting:  this is an album without flaws or blemishes.  Nothing is hurried or incomplete.  There are no wasted opportunities.  The musicianship is stunning, the songwriting is complex yet accessible, the production on the album is fantastic (bar-raising, even)... this is, IMO, a perfect album and easily the best thing I've bought all year.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I received these packages on December 14th but I am blaming the post office.  The product is excellent and I'm just happy I can finally enjoy them before Christmas is over.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm loving this game but it has crashed a few times and lost my progress :(  my husband has even snuck my kindle in his office and played this game

You will be doing yourself, your children, your family and your planet a favor
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game for every one in the family. The kids will deffinetly love it. Fun for the adults too
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|they fixed zoom problem. much better game now. on chapter 10 and have not run out of time on any screen.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Has all the top Seger songs I was looking for. I am not a real big Seger fan though but isf your like me won't need to get any other Seger CD.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Got this for My Grandson , I KNOW He will love it  .He is only 13 months ...BUT I know he will love it
B0085YNML2|5.0|this app is so cute. I love the lil guys face whn he eats his lunch. my 5 year old daughter loves this game... even she can do it... very intertaining
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game had a lot hidden object scenes as well as mini games to break it up a little bit.  It was not especially challenging at the relaxed level so I can 't say anything about difficulty at that level.  I may go back and play it, but for the most part this game right up my alley.  It gave me a little challenge but not so much as to engender frustration.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This movie had a great premise : President Lincoln's secret life as a vampire hunter that history never taught children in school.<br />We get to see young Abe and how he stumbled into the world of vampire hunting to his romance and marriage to his wife and finally the Presidentcy.<br />The acting was top notch along with the production values, highly recomend.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|two music icons the rolling stones and muddy waters on stage together!  this time forgotten extravaganza, surprisingly, is not dated  if you love blues (electric and traditional)  this item is highly recommended
B0073U2FB2|4.0|I gave this show four out of five stars which by my standards is pretty good.<br />The show was original in that the story took place in Russia even though it was Americans who were the main charecters.<br />The production values, special effects, acting ect. were good.<br />My only disapointment was the ending but I still recommend it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Have recently put my own eBook up on Amazon, so it was good to have this book to reference.<br /><br />I haven't read the entire book, didn't need to, but it came up with the right information when I needed it, so it did its job.<br /><br />Recommended to all self-publishers looking to publish on Amazon.
B00015YVDG|5.0|Very good movie.  Will watch it over and over.  Can't imagine that kind of bravery in a Father.  But got the job done.
B00005UW9T|3.0|It skipped at the beginning and had to fast foward past it to get it to play.  a little disappointed.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|Boring, boring, boring.  I watched it three nights in a row and it put me to sleep each night.  Never did finish the whole thing.  Will never insert it in my DVD Player again.

B0086HJW76|4.0|It was good driving music while out shopping. I relate to the songs analog man, lucky that way and family.
B005LAIISA|3.0|This Ice Age 4 was more zany, crazy, and over-the-top than any of the earlier Ice Age movies.  Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was my most favorite and the only version I wanted to own a copy of, on DVD.<br /><br />The movie company did not make Ice Age 4: Continental Drift available to rent on the day the DVD was released so, out of impatience, I purchased a DVD copy for the sole purpose of seeing this movie for the first time.<br /><br />Even though it had outlandish geological events and crazy situations and outcomes, I still like it as my second favorite Ice Age movie because I like Manny's mammoth family, who's daughter is now a teenager, and I'm glad that the Saber Cat, Diego, finally got a female partner though, the film could have spent more time developing their relationship.<br /><br />I like the continuing concept in the series of \\"We are a herd.\\"  \\"Herds look out for each other.\\"  This aspect of the stories gives me a warm feeling inside.<br /><br />The movie may grow on me enough to compel me to keep the DVD, I purchased or, I may sell it used on Amazon Marketplace.
B0014EVO4M|4.0|Probably one of my favorite movie soundtracks, but it isn't very long.  The entire soundtrack only lasts about 30 minutes
B0087HT36U|5.0|cool little game with some decent graphics for what it is.  provides a decent challenge in the later levels.  updates pretty regularly just waiting on the next set of levels to open up.  hurry up guys!
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were all excellent!  The movie is sad and tragic, enthralling and entertaining.  Loved it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I watched the first film because a friend said you will like it,  and then I asked my friend if I could borrow the rest of them and I am hooked, I read all the books and have all of the films.
030758836X|4.0|I am a huge audio book fan, so i listened to this book instead of reading.  The audiobook was GREAT and the actors who read it were amazing.  Now, having said that, the book was the CRAZIEST ride and while I have to give kudos to Gillian Flynn, how on earth can you be THAT creative to dream up Amy Dunn, the supersociopath???  I just have to believe that Ms. Flynn is a bit \\"socio\\" herself to even come up with a character so perfectly insane.  I have never been so satisfied and infuriated all at the same time and I've read a LOT of crime novels.  I've read so many of the reviews and how people feel let down at the end.  I share that feeling and Ms. Flynn will only be redeemed if there is a sequel.  So,  If you're on the fence about reading this, please do.  I bet you will have the feeling of \\"let down\\" at the end, but the ride is sooo worth it. And I think anyone who enjoys a good novel should definitely have the pleasure of being introduced to Amy Dunn.
B008G59IKO|5.0|Listening to Dos! as I write this.<br />Even though Uno! had already exceeded my expectations, Dos! was even better.<br />Just to start with the packaging--beautiful.  Cover goes perfectly with the other albums in the trilogy, great pictures of the band on the insert, the lyrics are displayed both neatly and creatively and overall, it looks very nice.<br />The music (sorry if I get too in depth here):<br /><br />See you tonight -- is catchy sweet, heartfelt.  I think its the perfect intro to the harder album of the three, even though this is a soft song.<br />F*** Time-- I personally find it impossible to listen to this song without laughing.  It's a crazy, absurd (in a good way) song<br />Stop When The Red Lights Flash -- fast paced, great guitar work (yay Jason White and Billie Joe), very garage-rocky feel<br />Lazy Bones -- The lyrics of this song are so twistedly beautiful.  If you buy the album for one reason, let it be this song.<br />Wild One -- One of those romantic-swaying-to songs for me. Great bass line, too<br />Makeout Party -- for fans of the Green Day side project Foxboro Hottubs. This is such a retro garage-rock sound, you can't help but think of &#34;The Pedestrian&#34; or &#34;Stop Drop and Roll&#34;<br />Stray Heart -- Awesome song, but after listening to Tre!, I see why it was originally supposed to be on there and not Dos! Doesn't fit perfectly in the lineup, but still a masterpiece. (the music vid is great too, you should check it out, if you haven't)<br />Ashley -- Perfect for after a bad break up. full of that classic angst of Green Day.<br />Baby Eyes -- Classic rock n' roll, always the best lyrics (Billie Joe Armstrong is a lyrical genius)<br />Lady Cobra -- Another Foxboro Hottubs sounding one.  upbeat, fun and spunky<br />Nightlife -- probably my least favorite on the album, but uses interesting lyric overlap<br />Wow! That's Loud -- I love the riffs on this song, there just so Green Day<br />Amy -- Puts me on the verge of tears. Its a really beautiful tribute to Amy Winehouse<br /><br />Well, if you read through my entire fan-girl analysis of Dos!, it's really a great album. I would recommend it to any punk or alt rock fan.

B004J4WN0I|3.0|If Dresden Files never existed, I'd give this a 4 out of 5 stars.  It's easy and enjoyable to read, the descriptions are good, the plots are decent, and the details regarding the Druid concept itself are somewhat refreshing.<br /><br />Sadly, it seems to lose a lot in just trying to hold together every possible Dresden Files element. Lets list a few here:<br /><br />Harry = Atticus (the main character)<br />Bob (the talkative skull sidekick for comedic pop culture banter) = Oberon (the talkative DOG sidekick for comedic pop culture banter...yes the dog watches tv and nerds out about it)<br />Molly (super hot young apprentice) = Granuaile (super hot young apprentice)<br />Semi-allied Werewolf crew = Semi-allied Werewolf crew (come on seriously?)<br />Faery Godmother Leaninsidhe = Faery Protector Morrigan (pretty eater of the dead lady faerie)<br />Butters the medical examiner = Snorki the secret doctor (a werewolf, instead of just the boyfriend of a werewolf).<br />Chicago = Tempe<br /><br />Some of the problems here come up with trying to basically give Atticus EXACTLY the same personality as Harry Dresden.  Same sense of humor, same interests, same pop culture references, same vernacular.  The reason given?  The main character is trying to \\"blend in\\"...  Uh then why doesn't he just act normal instead of like a rambunctious 8 year old that just finished watching Pulp Fiction and Star Wars for the first time?  The main character is also 2100 years old, I can understand him picking up some pop-culture, but why would this grown man of 2100 years EVER have given time to watching Scooby Doo?  Oh yes that reminds me, he calls marijuana smokers \\"drug addicts\\" so it's not that.  Harry Dresden was a CHILD at some point in the last century, he has an excuse for watching kid's programs, Atticus though?  Yep, he has to mimic Harry so it just gets tacked on thoughtlessly, much like Oberon the dog.  The dog is taught to mind-speak in english, thus it understands tv and film...thus it becomes hyper-intelligent and abnormally interested in human culture and acts almost exactly like Bob (minus the porn).  The same basic copycat-without-logic concept just permeates the rest of the characters as well.  Fortunately, it leaves the rather decent plots intact.<br /><br />The really major two differences aside from just renaming everything though is that 1. People laugh hysterically at only mildly funny things in this book, rather NOT laughing at actually funny things like in Dresden Files.  2.  The world premise of \\"no one notices most paranormal things because they aren't looking for them or assume they're something else\\" (ie Dresden Files) is replaced with a much more cumbersome system in this book which can be summed up as \\"everyone notices everything paranormal and drives to the main character's house with the cops every time anything happens that's why ALL CHARACTERS IN ALL BATTLES EVERYWHERE HAVE TO HAVE MAGIC INVISIBILITY ON AT ALL TIMES.  I'm not kidding.  That's the work around.  That's the original idea.  Ugh.<br /><br />I'll probably keep reading anyway just because it is still an enjoyable series.  It's just got some serious shortcomings that I've mostly covered there.  If you liked Dresden Files, you'll like this series as long as you're ready for a really close mimic.  If on the other hand you START with this series, you'll probably like Dresden Files a hell of a lot more when you finally move on to it.s it becomes hyper-intelligent and abnormally interested in human culture and acts almost exactly like Bob (minus the porn).

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I've always wanted to play my own version of Oregon Trial. This is definitely a very fun and enjoyably addicting version of it. I really recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|I had to give it one star for the scenery for that period of time.  As for the dialogue, I didn't understand it  They don't talk good.  Who learned them?  I didn't see any sub-titles.  If you like soap operas this one is for you.  Read somewhere there was 15 hours of this joke on the DVD.  Not so.  I was more than disappointed for the 6 hours I viewed.

0307951529|5.0|As the owner of a current business that was started for less than 100 bucks, I'm filled with ideas, but never seem to take action.<br /><br />This book does a great job outlining all the basic steps of starting a business, and provides a lot of actionable items and steps, which is my favorite part.<br /><br />If you're looking for advice on corporations, tax advice, etc, this isn't that type of book-- this book is the one you NEED to read before any of that type of stuff.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|This movie makes me feel like everything is actually happening and that I am there. No airconditioning in the 1920's and they show these rich people sweating. Small details like that are great for realism.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but never got around to seeing it in theaters. Needless to say, I started it last night and wasn't able to finish it. Listen, I don't mind this type of comedy--that isn't the problem. This is just a bad movie, and I personally did not find it one bit funny. The accents are bad (Wahlberg-bad Boston, Ted-Peter from Family Guy) and honestly, the only real story is a man's boyhood attachment to his teddy bear, which is a washed up celebrity able to talk, move, and think like a human. Everybody is trying too hard (Wahlberg, Seth M., Mila Kunis, and even Joel McHale, who I normally like). Obviously some people enjoyed this movie--I just found it incredibly stupid and 100% not funny.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|love the show, the dvds were in great conditions, packaging was in good conditions, the dvds played nicely, never skip

0316776963|5.0|First, I must state that I rarely have the time for reading. However, after reading this book, I made the time to read more David Sedaris books. This book is hilarious.
1452111014|4.0|Well, I give this a four out of 5 because it just seems to be lacking a few pieces of art that I was looking forward to seeing. Such as concept art for King Candy in his Cybug form. Plus a look into a small few areas but nothing major, otherwise the book covers all the world designs quite well.<br /><br />Otherwise this art book gives you an in depth look into the design stages of Ralph, Felix and Calhoune. I'd say more but I wouldn't want to ruin the experience.<br /><br />Plus it's ten bucks cheaper here on amazon so it's worth the 30 dollars.
1419705849|5.0|My fiances child likes all of the wimpy kid books. I think they have a good mix of pictures and text.
B006546EPA|5.0|Considering (at the time of this review) one gets each disc for less than $2, this has to be one of the best bargains available at Amazon. This 35-disc set contains most of the music of Richard Strauss in mostly classic, knowing performances. True, one doesn't get 'Arabella', 'Capriccio' or 'Intermezzo' but one does get marvelous performances of 'Der Rosenkavalier', 'Ariadne auf Naxos', 'Die Frau ohne Schatten', 'Elektra', 'Salome', and 'Friedenstag' among the operas. There are absolutely first-rate performances (10 CDs!) of the tone poems and other orchestral music by the, for my money, best ever interpreter of them, Rudolf Kempe and the magnificant Dresdener Staatskapelle. There is all the chamber music (more than I realized there was) on 4 CDs, including the concerted horn works with piano accompaniment, excellent four-hand music and solo piano music on 3 CDs, the oddly compelling melodramas (best-known one is 'Enoch Arden') on one CD, choral orchestral music (one CD) conducted by Michel Plasson, Lieder sung by sung by Mitsuko Shirai, another CD of Lieder with Richard Strauss himself accompanying and featuring such singers as Anton Dermota, Hilde Konetzni, Alfred Poell and Maria Reining (all stars of their day -- but in all fairness Konetzni isn't in good voice), and finally, the orchestral songs (including the Four Last Songs) sung rather well by Charlotte Margiano, with orchestra conducted by Edo de Waart. 35 discs in all. That's a lot of Strauss, enough to last a lifetime for sure.<br /><br />There is also a DVD containing opera synopses and a documentary about Strauss by Stephen Jay-Taylor.<br /><br />The downside here is that there is no booklet, so no notes and no librettos or song texts. Clearly this set is for those who are willing, if they desire, to look these things up on the Internet where they are readily available with a little digging.<br /><br />I know I more than got my money's worth.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've been a Preston & Child reader for a very long time; books authored together and separately.  The Prendergast novels have always been my favorite and this is my new pentultimate.  Once started, I could not put this down.  Haven't touched the morning newspaper, and since my Kindle passed away mid-read, I've finished on my IPhone.  Fantastic read, you will not be disappointed
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|5 stars for Ms. Milan, character depth and humor and of course a happy ending for all.  A \\"must read\\", don't miss this feel good book.  Best of all in these economic times, the price is delicious frosting on the cake.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is the BEST art/photo app!<br />I have been using it daily and share all of my work on facebook!<br /><br />Have tried EVERY app. like this available, and Picsart cuts WAY above the rest! And, it's FREE!!!!<br />All of the similar apps out there are nowhere near comparable! THEY charge to unlock features.<br />Picsart gives you MUCH MORE features and never charge! Even for upgrading, because there is NOT upgrading with this, only their recent &quot;updated &quot; version, as they have just added some new, cooler feature effects!<br />Highly recommend this app!<br />You won't be disappointed, only have hours of FUN and creating!
1451620829|5.0|This is an interesting Rock biography in that he shares the up and down side of being a Rock Star.  A lot of reviewers seem to feel that this biography is very negative.  But I think perhaps his intention was to show people that a person can survive a lot of negativity, and bad situations - some of his own creation through his own wreckless, and others forced on him by the personalities and machinery surrounding the band - but still get through to a better more peaceful place in life.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a P.S. to me former review. I've given it the 5 stars without watching it, as I'm sure it'll be what I expected!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a great book, one that I simply couldn't put down.  Needless to say I was purchasing the next two books before I even finished reading this one.
B0085YNML2|1.0|I thought this looked interesting so I downloaded it. no sooner had it installed then my kindle went nuts, blinking, the screen going blurry, refusing to let me uninstall apps (the icons still show). I got it to uninstall but even after shutting it down twice and doing a hard reset its still acting strange. I may have to factory reset :( so beware
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading all three of the Stieg Larsson books.  The only disappointment is that this is his last book.
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Addison Smith (RZA) is a blacksmith in an anachronistic 19th century medieval Oriental village. His plan is to leave the area with his prostitute girlfriend Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) to whom he gives his money to put away for when they escape. There are two villages/ clans that are in battle with each other, the Lions and the Wolves who come complete with their own puns. The emperor asks the head of the Lions, Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen) to take a shipment of gold to a northern village as some sort of peace offering (plot isn't important in this film). He is betrayed and killed by his two deputies, Silver and Bronze Lion. I think you see where this naming thing is going...move over James Bond.<br /><br />Zen Yi, The X-Blade (Rick Yune) decides to avenge his father's death while Silver Lion has declared war on the Wolf Clan and the Geminis escort the gold. To add to the confusion, Silver Lion has hired the impenetrable Brass Body (Dave Bautista) to hunt Zen Yi while Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) a British killer fortune seeker hangs out at the very colorful brothel called the Pink Blossom run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).<br /><br />This film includes a modern hip-hop sound track complete with MF and N words. The martial arts fighting ignores the laws of gravity. The blood squirts are over the top bright red. Zen Yi has spring loaded 8 inch spikes that pop out of 2 inches of armor. The fighting is extremely choreographed. Of course there is the signature Tarantino restaurant scene and split screen. No weird flashbacks. RZA didn't copy that. Worth a view for &#34;Kill Bill&#34; fans.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, N-word, sex, no nudity.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I could hardly wait to read this one.  The author &#34;grabs&#34; the reader right at the beginning and doesn't let go.  Another one that kept me reading into the wee hours!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|The story begins at the space academy where a group of privileged teens train to fight the &#34;insurgents&#34; a group of &#34;over taxed farmers&#34; as cadet Thomas Lasky (Tom Green) puts it. He has trouble with cryo-sleep as it makes him violently ill. He also has a love interest in Silva (Anna Popplewell, Queen of Narnia). The film centers around the character of Lasky and his relationship with his fellow students as well as his medical condition.<br /><br />The students realize something isn't right. When the academy is attacked, they must all man up.<br /><br />This is part of a series. As a stand alone film, it makes little sense as the background information is provided in bits and pieces. This is geared toward a teen/ young adult audience, having the feel of &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; with its over the top military propaganda speeches.<br /><br />Rated TV-14, although outside of the violence, it could very well be PG. One co-ed locker room scene with girl in bra top. One use of &#34;D&#34; male member word.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm really enjoying this book. It's been a while since I've read someting that I could really get into and loose track of time. The writing style is what really makes it. I may have to see the move before Ihave time to finish the book. However, I believe I'll still finish reading the book. I bought and started reading this after I'd seen the movie previews and overheard people describing the main plot and yet am still enjoying the read.
B0013816GK|5.0|One of the best performances of Verdi's Requiem I have ever heard.  The soloists are outstanding.  The entire work is very moving.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game, no problems. Pop up ads are easy to skip and go right to game. Can change card backs and background colors.
098478280X|5.0|This book has prepared me well for technical interviews. For each chapter, there is an introduction to the topic discussed in that chapter, followed by a good number of exercises, with solutions of all the problems. The exercise questions covered are very similar to the technical interview questions I got from top software companies.<br /><br />The author has also made source code of solutions (in Java) online for download.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|David Tennant is my Dr but in this season Matt Smith really comes in to the role with the help of same great stories and a really good season long plotline.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie.  It's done really well.  Unfortunately, both kids are feeling a bit under the weather this weekend, so it's become movie fest....  Good news is that we just got this movie and a few more.  It is currently playing for the 4th time in the last 2 days.  Only reason it hasn't played more is that I've been forcing some other movies through
1439127700|5.0|This book is filled with insights into the lives and minds of our highest-ranking statesmen. It is well-researched, easy to read, and fascinating on many levels. Duffy and Gibbs have created an historical milestone in presidential history with their collected stories, impressions, and facts, making the men who have held this elite office, and their decisions, understandable and relevant.
0316789720|4.0|Make sure you get colored pencils and large paper. its a step by step and it is very helpful. My son enjoys this. He is 11.
1616960922|5.0|This is an excellent fantasy story written based on an interesting, original premise.  This is a rather short work but well crafted; it could have had a bit more development.  The characters are immediately interesting and have obvious depth but more scope in their presentation would have been welecomed.  I suspect that there are enough elements left open here for the author to return to this universe at a future date and I hope that he does so.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|Ultraviolet digital copy is absolutely one of the worst things ever.  Any movie that contains this crap instead of a true digital copy will not be purchased by me again.  I'll just buy it from iTunes
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Never could get it to run on the Kindle, so I uninstalled it.  My kids love it on the Droid phone.  I tried it, it was interesting, not as engaging as Angry Birds, and kinda hard for my fat fingers to play on the small screen.  I'll wait a while, then try downloading again for the Kindle, maybe I'll like it better on the larger screen.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This is a great movie that tells the story of how the X-Men originated.  I highly recommend this movie.  A true digital copy makes this package a great buy!
0321857895|5.0|A nice little book about visual note taking, full of entertaining illustration. Author shows us another way of capturing ideas, not just in writing. And explain basic principles of how to create sketchnotes even if you are not the artist. But we have to start, have fun, and practice. Additional, there are tips and tricks and ideas from his friends (how they started, which tools they use...)
B000002KIQ|5.0|Ry Cooder is amazing.  As a musician, I know how difficult it is to play in a certain style or period.  Ry does it on this album in authentic 20's - 30's flavor.  I can see why he gets asked to do movie scores.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This set contains the two essential Alien films, and throws in the mediocre Resurrection and polarizing Alien 3. The special features make the additional films worthwhile in their own right, and add to the experience of the first two.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This must be the bargain of the century! I paid $20 for this box set which comes wrapped in a holographic foil print, and a beautifully designed book-style holder for the blurays. So great to see these movies again. Although some (not all) of the effects look dated by contemporary standards, 'Alien' and 'Aliens' both have gripping stories and great creature design. Haven't re-watched the third and fourth films yet - I remember the third as being quite disappointing - but look forward to revisiting them with a fresh mind.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Very entertaining, suspenseful movie about how in 1979 the CIA exfiltrated six American diplomats who have escaped the takeover of the American embassy by supporters of the Ayatullah Khomeini and taken refuge in the Canadian embassy, without the knowledge of the Iranian authorities (the historical and political background is shown in an attractive animated segment at the beginning of the film - and is the only part in the movie where the Americans set themselves for criticism for their previous support of the deposed Shah). For that endeavor, the CIA sent an exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck, who is very good and who also directed). After conventional escape plans were explored and looked like they wouldn't work out, Mendez thought up a bizarre plan: go to Iran and leave with the six diplomats pretending that they belong to a Canadian film crew planning to film a B type Sci Fi film named Argo in Iran. To give credibility to the story, Mendez had two film producers (played by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) set up an office in Hollywood as if the planned movie was for real. Surprisingly, the ploy worked (since this story is public knowledge, I don't think saying this is much of a spoiler).<br /><br />Great recreation of an era and a place (Istanbul and Los Angeles are a believable stand-in for Tehran, along with some digital graphics playing the mountains in the background). Interesting and gripping throughout, even if some details were obviously added for dramatic effect (almost certainly the Iranians didn't chase the leaving plane in the runway). About the only flaw of movie: the constant, irritating, self absorbed in-jokes of the two movie producers.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Interesting treasure hunt type game. Basic point and click game play that anyone can enjoy. Works great on HTC One V.
B00000IZOR|3.0|Ok so when I first saw this phone on amazon it was a picture of the chatter phone with buttons, not the spin dial thing. So I decided to order it. When it was delivered I opened it immediately and saw that it had the spin dial. I took it to my house and let my niece play with it, it's her xmas gift, and she looked at it picked it up handed it to me rolled her eyes and walked away. I guess I have to get her somethin else because she definitely won't play with this. Other than that, it was delivered the day after I placed my order so super fast delivery
B002M2T1UO|3.0|Since I had never seen any episodes of this series I was taken off guard that this show was allowed on tv even though it's my understanding it isn't during the time children would watch it.<br />I thought it was a bit over the top for television and was disappointed that it was so explicit.<br />I got the &#34;Commish&#34; complete series because I really like Michael Chiklis and would definitely recommend it but bought this because of Michael Chiklis and it's not in my estimation something I would recommend to anyone.<br />Some people may like this...I do not.
1451695195|5.0|Beautifully written story. I felt like I was reading a fantasy, but the fact that it was written by a scientist made me consider and ultimately accept the reality of the story. I believe in God and this story gave me a beautiful example of what heaven could actually be like. It reminded me of when Jesus said in the Bible that the Father has many rooms for us up in heaven. I beleive that it is no coinicidence that Dr. Alexander loved skdiving and his &#34;experience&#34; in heaven was flying through the landscape. This story fills me with hope!
006198969X|5.0|Lots of great tips and resources, even stores with great deals and product... Great to use for clients if u work retail like me :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Oh if only I could win so much at the arcade! Once you develop a technique it&quot;s rven more fun. Especially  at the higher levels.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Simply an amazing release.  Picture and sound quality are both great.  I would give it 6 stars if I could.  They still got it, still showing how it's done!  Jones looks like is having a great time, Plant is pretty good (I was worried, but the voice is in good shape), and Page, what can I say, he's a electric guitar god.  Bonham son is great seriously - I guess it was kind of a blessing to have a younger, more energetic guy on drum for this show.<br /><br />I'm kind of pissed at them because they don't want to tour - but hey, if they don't feel like it, they better not do it anyway.<br /><br />(I have the 1BR-2CD version, I don't care about the rehearsal, so I can't comment on the additional DVD).
B00127RAJY|5.0|I originally rented this DVD from the library since all the reviews and progress pictures were so promising. I ended up purchasing this DVD. It's a great 30 minute workout and it gives you results within a week. After the first week I already felt different. I also recommended this to some friends and they also love it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book that is really awesome and I can't wait for the next awesome book to come out!!!!! I'm so excited!!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A wonderful and outstanding movie! I love Robert Downey Jr, and he plus the other fantastic actors did a splendid job on this great film!
020530902X|5.0|a phenomenal read. it is the bible for writing and delivery skills, any aspiring writer MUST read this, its faitly easy, and and a fundamental rule book.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|What can I say about this movie except that it confims what we all have known all along, this fraction of the population is rittled by parental abuse, incest, drug addiction and welfare fraud. Why OW and Tyler Perry would have ever pursued this endevore is beyond any comprehension. I had no sympathy before seeing this movie and I have less now.<br />-dop
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are quick to play and something to help pass the time. My son likes it, as do I. Free is not always good, but this one is.
B007CRTNWK|5.0|Fast shipping, and book was great. No writing or severe damage. This was in such great condition I donated it to my teacher for more students to read after I was done.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|it rocks very much how many words can i use to describe led zeppelin and comparing them to rolling stones
B000256TD0|5.0|This is a present for my (adult) son for Christmas.  He's going to be very surprised and delighted.  I've not taken it out of the box as I know that it will be a collector's item for my son.  From what I see in the box, it looks awesome.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A handy calculator for basic calculations. I don't have any complaints;it's prompt and accurate. I recommend this app for everyone!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app. is simple but at the same time it has all you need. I love it and recommend it to those who need a calculator with them.
034580404X|5.0|I have been wanting to read this trilogy for a long time! Have heard so much about them and can't wait to dive into them! I am quite sure I will love them!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|shows only a handful of statuses in newsfeed. then there are a few in plain text. this is terrible. please fix or give us the real android version.<br /><br />UPDATE - 1/21/2013 Looks like they've finally corrected the app. Works like it should.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This is a real feel good album with songs that get you in a good mood! Makes me wish it was summer already!
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|SPOILER...SPOILER...SPOILER.....I have not SEEN this thing,  but i can't  resist mentioning a point that has drawn me to it...i love sciffi, right back to the originals like wells and verne, and then blurring into the yet other originals of horror, such as poe and bierce...i am REALLY taken with gibson's cyberpunk books, beginning with his masterwork, NEUROMANCER..at least one .film have been tried out on them...johnny mnemonic,...which was disastrous...no one mad enough to try neuromancer, and probably will not be...but it does introduce simstim, the sharing of another's senrory experriences as they live them...but not of  personalities...have seen this done in at least one story, and it raises some interesting questions...such as how competitive will doubled personalities will be?  after being prometheized to the edge of coma, am looking for something like this to smooth away the trauma... as long as it's reasonably imaginative, i will be interested to see what fresh dollops it has to add to the cp genre...ciao.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I have seen Zac Brown in concert a few times and love his music.  This is a great CD.  It pretty much lives in my CD player.  Great country music that doesn't sound like everyone else.  Don't hesitate, get this CD!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|ALIENS is one of the best scifi movies of all time and it has two versions included in this set.  If you are a fan of this series this set is for you. The blu ray transfer is amazing and the extras for all 4 alien movies are increible, this set is LOADED. And the price of this set is generally less than $30.  Worth every penny.
B002V0WN2K|5.0|Another quality album from Bon Jovi.  Maybe not as good as Have a nice day but if you are a BJ fan you will enjoy.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wonderful memoir. If you want to be transported into the author's world in which she hikes 1,100 solo miles on the Pacific Crest Trail and all the while sorts out her emotional (and interesting) past, choose this book. I love reading memoirs and biographies and I would say this is in the top 3 that I read this year. The author is simply a really good writer with an interesting tale.
B001TH8UUA|3.0|Decent enough and average quality cable.  Seems to be ok for the money but remains to be seen how long it will hold up.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat for every episode of this series. Don't even think twice about renting or buying this entire serues,  you will not be disappointed.  Breaking Bad IS IT!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|Great movie a classic shipped in two days so quick this would be a great gift for the holidays for someone
B001IXXYBA|5.0|The movie Ghost .  The chemistry between Patririck and Demi was wonderful. Whoopi was great as the psychic and truly believable. Ghost is just one of the classics.
B00846REIS|3.0|I prefer a bit more excitement I suppose. A bit of exhibitionism, but maybe too &#34;vanilla&#34; for me... I am spoiled on Fifty Shades.
0062183591|4.0|I read this book as a student in the Carlow University Master's of Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis ([...]  In this book, Dan Ariely does many experiments in order to answer the question, \\"why do people lie?\\"  He emphasized that everyone does it at some point in time, but he was determined why.<br /><br />In this book, Ariely does many, very interesting tests to try and get the answers.  His studies show the certain degree in which people are willing to cheat.  One of the most interesting studies in the book is when there is money involved.  People were less likely to cheat when there was more money involved, which I found odd.  Before I read this book, I definitely would've thought the exact opposite.  Ariely finds that most groups cheat to the same degree.  The nice thing about this book is that it is interesting, but he finds a way to put some humor into it.<br /><br />A weakness with this book for me was the way it started to be a bit repetitive.  It seems like this book could've been summed up in a few chapters, but it continued on and on stretching the findings out throughout the book.  Like I said it was a very interesting book, just could've been shortened a little to keep the reader's attention after the first few chapters.<br /><br />As I prepare to enter the world of fraud and forensics, I have a much better understanding of why people cheat and the<br />rationalization used for doing so.  This book can provide a professional with skills to help in fraud investigations.  Overall, I did find this book to be beneficial regardless of the redundancy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|For a good time killer download is nice to have waiting in the docs waiting room or to relax before bed
B0085YNML2|4.0|Munch Time is a Nice game that is somewhat like Cut The Rope but has it's own theme and Colorful style that make it Unique, Fun and Enticing.  A cute Chameleon will use his Long Tongue to latch on to anchor points on colored flowers that you select but he must first catch colored Flies to match the needed color.  Good puzzles to navigate by getting Chameleon to swing from one point to another with only his powerful tongue.  Simple game-No Complaints... Here's what I like:<br /><br />1). Graphics are cute and Colorful. You decide when and how to use Colored Flowers.<br />2). Music and Sounds are very Pleasant.<br />3). Controls work well on Xoom Tablet and Physics are realistic.<br />4). Challenging (well designed) Tasks get progressively harder.<br />5). Unique game style with Color driven challenges keeps you thinking about strategy.<br />6). Good Menu and Options to help player.  You can Exit completely with Back button.<br />7). No Intrusive Ads or other Annoyances that I see so far.<br />8). Only 1 Permission and seems Safe enough.<br /><br />Overall, it's a Pleasant and Addictive game that keeps you Engaged.  It starts off Slow and Easy but soon gets much harder in challenging ways that are not too extreme.  I like it and recommend for all ages.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Extremely well written. I couldn't put it down from the moment i started reading it! On to Mockingjay ... :)
1455527475|4.0|There are very few people on Wall Street that would have done what Greg Smith did. Is it any wonder that i can't trust Wall Street anymore. These are people that HAVE to be forced to do the right thing. Thank you Mr. Smith for having the courage and fortitude to state that more regulation is required. If only our politicians had the guts to enact some strong laws regulating Wall Street. I am afraid as long as the Campaign finance laws are not changed, politicians will be heavily influencede by the same money that causes Wall Street to do the wrong thing consistently.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! I really think Suzanne Collins pulled it off. One of my favorite books. I finished it in 1 day!
0812993292|5.0|I chose this rating because the book is beautifully written. It's characters come alive, so that we care about what happens to them.  The kindness shown to Harold makes us feel a bit better about the world in general and that is a message sorely needed today.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am really enjoying listing to Adele; this cd has great music and unusual arrangments. She deserves the musuc awards she won this year.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I didn't understand the craz over pintrest, but now i think it's awesome, it took a while, but i understand it and love it
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My daughter enjoyed this movie at the theaters and now seems like everyday at home.  Great movie for kids...even better for girls...gives them a sense that they can accomplish anything.
B000ITF86E|5.0|I hated this movie as a kid but the older I get the more I appreciate John Wayne s humor. also includes some of the best sidekicks.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|this is a great movie that was funny and had plenty of action for all to watch and enjoy it.
B006VA57CY|5.0|What else is there to say, I guess I don't understand why there are so few in the genre when there is so much success, but oh well.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|this is a must have must see movie.  I am a sailor and instantly fell in love with this movie.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|John Wayne and Robert Mitcham two of the biggest personalities ever put together on film... and it totally works. word
B004LWZW6K|2.0|I enjoyed the first movie...well other then the bad CGI fish. For the most part it was fun. This movie however just lacked EVERYTHING the first movie was fun for. Except for the fact the fish actually looked sorta decent in this one.<br /><br />Piranha 3DD is about the same batch of Piranha's that struck in the last movie. Except these can eat through things and are apparently attracted to the smell of chlorine. Because of this and the greedy actions of one man they end up getting into the water supply at a local water park. The water park is run by Maddy and her stepfather, Chet. Maddy is only back for summer vacation and discovers he's changed her family's water park into an adult pool party. Well, partly at least. He's hired a ton of babes for lifeguards. And he's opened an adult's only area of the park where people can drink, be nude and just get wet and wild. Due to this \\"Adult Pool\\" area of the water park, I fully expected most of the movie to take place in that area as they actually could have done a lot with it. Tons of sex, tons of nudity and comedy, but they didn't go that route. In fact, there was about 7 minutes of that area and the rest was all regular swimmers at the main pool.<br /><br />While the production values and concept weren't that bad, I was looking for more of the same formula that the first movie brought - Great gore, a little comedy and nudity. I didn't feel this movie really delivered on what I was expecting, and I won't bother watching it again.
B000HKW7E0|2.0|funny movie. not as good as elf and definitely a bit unreal for a film trying to make fun of realism.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Once starting the game didn't want to put it down. Especially appreciated the horizontal play mode. The puzzles were solvable, but still challenging. Great game!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, I was glad to find it in english. Tryed to read subtilles for over 2 hours, couldn't do it.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Lots of your favorite Perry songs are on this CD.  Her music is fun and upbeat.  Be ready for a few ear worms though!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very Great Book<br />I liked this book a lot and it only took a few ours to read and its funny
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Gotye won fame with the single &#34;Somebody I Used to Know&#34; but the rest of his music is very good too.  Some of it has a strange, otherworldly sound, but overall the music is unique and nice to listen to.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|The quality of the writing, one-liners, slapstick, facial expressions, puns, delivery in this film is timeless!  I have seen this movie at least 20 times since it came out and it never fails to make me laugh out loud.  MelBrooks isn't everyone's cup of tea, but this is one of his finest.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I didn't see the point in Pinterest at first but it is fun.  Find projects, jokes, beautiful quotes and photos, and waste some time.  The app works OK on my Galaxy and Kindle.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A lot of fun and a great hand-eye coordination tool and diversion.  Recommend for all ages and Star Wars or Angry Birds fans.  New Update is very good.
B008S4YZCO|2.0|This is a fun and cute little game.  I didn't have any problems with it, it just got &#34;old&#34; pretty fast.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Fun way to spend time.  I would recommend it. just like Oregon trail in a way. same idea just in battle mode.
B005LAII08|5.0|I took my daughter to see this for her birthday.  What a great memory for the first time watching this lovely movie!  I adore Merida and all that she stands for.  The music and cinematography are gorgeous.  Seeing a strong female character is quite important to me as a mother.  Combining that with a good story, Brave is a must-see and must-own movie for the whole family!
145470246X|5.0|Many great items in the book and designs are practical and patterns easy to follow.<br />Glad I got this book.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence + the Machine have a unique sound all their own.  All the tracks on this CD are really good.  If you haven't seen them....check out their videos as well, which give a neat visual experience.
0061992860|5.0|You had better have great eye sight in order to read this book, but its small and lightweight so you can carry it with you anywhere.  It covers everything you can possibly imagine from island survival to emergency childbirth.  I would strongly suggest this book!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My child wanted the game and parts are just to difficult for a small child to understand. but we lay ot together and its fun.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Finally got to start watching this mind-twitching TV classic from just 22 years ago!  It came well-packaged without any dents in the DVD cover---No broken disc cases, either!  Highly recommended from this vendor.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a cute book that definitely kept me reading. I would certainly recommend it. My only criticism would be that I sometimes felt like the .ain character was written as a mentally handicapped boy not a mentally ill man.
B00006BTC7|5.0|This album copped a lot of \\"they sound like Joy Division\\" remarks when it came out in 2002. I was really into Joy Division around that time so naturally I gave it a go.<br /><br />Yeah, it's reminiscent of Joy Division. At times it also reminds me of The Verve and US indie bands like Low and Cocaine, in that it's an incredibly cinematic sound. I love atmospheric music like that, this does a good job. The vocals are a baritone and the music overall is dark and dreamy, so I can understand the JD comparisons but this has its own sound.<br /><br />Good album, not a derivative ripoff, has its own sound. Recommended.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I don't give 5 stars very often, but Two Graves deserves nothing less.  The book grabs the reader from the first and doesn't let go until the end, and I wish there were more.  The only worrisome thing is, the authors tied up every single loose thread-they gave satisfying endings to each and every character and even made mention of Bill Smithback, a substantial character who was killed off several novels earlier.  This makes me a little nervous as to Preston and Childs' intention as to the future of Agent Pendergast.  While I dearly hate for a series to go on too long and ruin a great character, I truly hope that the Pendergast engine has lots of steam left and we will be hearing from him again soon.  If you are new to Pendergast, I would suggest that you read the other novels first so that the background for this novel will be laid.
0385504225|5.0|I enjoy reading Dan Brown has an author and enjoyed this book as much as his others. His book makes you think and make you feel as though you are in the story
3836501910|5.0|Terry's work is a guilty pleasure. I love how he sees the world with clarity and hyper sexuality! Always excited to see his new work!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Pros:<br />  1. Includes all three Nolan Batman films<br />  2. Includes The Art and Making of The Dark Knight mini book ( Great pictures and artwork)<br />  3. The packaging is great and can be opened up to a nice display.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  1. The Batman Begins portion does not contain as much features as the rest of the trilogy
B008SLAXGO|5.0|Great, fun images behind the scenes of mega star lady gaga...a great collectors items for someone who lives art, music and photography!
1419701533|5.0|Nice set of books that will entertain any kid of any age. The books are easy to read for any elementary school kid, and contain a lot of pictures so they wont went bored. Not literature, but entertaining.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|this is a great app if u are wondering why I purchased this woo ask yourself do I like listening to good music.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|love listening to Susan Boyle sing,  Excellent CD. Love the songs picketed for this CD.  Also liked the duets Will buy more of her CD's
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great game all around.  This game is a great game for people to try out as their first non-hasboro game.  Originally from Europe, this boardgame is actually the most popular boardgame in the world (being highly popular outside of the US), but it is only now making its way into the US.  I play it with my whole family and everyone that I play it with loves it.  My parents, my sorority girl sister, and both my brothers (25 and 15 years old).<br /><br />What is great about this game is that there is a lot of strategy, but it isn't overly complicated.  You trade resources with each other so you are frequently having fun interactions with the other players.  Another great aspect to the game is that when you setup the game, you lay the tiles down randomly, this means that each time the board is different.  There are literally enough combinations of the board so that you could play it every day of your life and never see the same board.  Depending on how the board is laid out a the game will play differently too, so while you will figure out some approaches, this isn't a game that you can \\"crack the code\\" and win each time so it keeps it interesting.
B004BSFC46|4.0|Love this idea and the colors. The bugs are perfect and my 3 month is just starting to really get excited when he sees these. My only complaint is that he is a chubby big baby and these just barely fit his wrists. I am afraid that within the next month we won't be able to velcro them anymore.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is amazing. Without even knowing it I played for two hours. The amimation is very clear and it works perfectly on the kindle fire. It is well worth the 99 cents. I absolutely love this app. There are no in app purchases so you get everything for the original 99 cents. This app if fun for ALL ages. What are you waiting for... GET THE APP!!!
B000AP04L0|5.0|First time I saw this was before my current job, which is working for a state government. It was funny, but I don't think it clicked with me until my current job. Now I find it hilarious, and the extras that are included on the DVD-ROM are nice as well.
037582913X|5.0|This is one of the cutest and most clever children's book concepts I've ever come across, and it makes for a really fun read. My daughter is only 6 months old now but she seems to enjoy looking at the illustrations and listening to my terrible Grover voice. I'm sure as she gets older and has a better understanding of what's actually going on she'll find it as funny and engaging as I do!<br /><br />I agree that the board book could be a bit bigger, but I don't see it as a big issue to be honest. We love this book! :)
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't usually buy cds anymore since I do a lot of online streaming<br />(Spotify, Pandora) but when I heard this girl on YouTube, I was hooked!<br />She's def on my top 10 list
B000VBIGD6|1.0|I'm all for silly movies, especially holiday themed ones that are just plain goofy.  But the scene where Clark lies to the sexy mall clerk, saying he's divorced, as he drools over her breasts... then his son walks up as he literally looking up the woman's thigh and picking up on her.  C'mon. That's not funny, that's sad.  And later Clark fantasizes over this same woman (we get the view of him visualizing her showing up) at his new backyard pool and we get to see a very revealing strip tease?  How is this family-friendly comedy? The pool scene really crossed the line. If this were'nt a movie for kids and family I wouldn't care, but how can you target that audience and then show scenes like that? Very poor taste in my opinion.
B00361R2VU|2.0|Worse than the Blair With Project. It might entertain a teenager but its not really scary as an adult. We watched this one and the sequels and they continued to get worse.
B00632HWOG|1.0|the update for this thing won't let me even see my mail I updated this morning and I still cant see my mail
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The batman grunt is somewhat tiring, especially after seeing the batman spoof videos on youtube. Overall the acting was good and I really enjoyed Bane.
1932100660|5.0|NOT A FAST READ BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES, BUT IT IS A POWERFUL BOOK, WHICH IS LIFE-CHANGING.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Worse graphics since the 90s. I checked the reviews on rotten tomato but gave it a shot anyway. I should have listened to rotten tomato and saved some money.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|A monumental film about human nature, about the aftermath of the Vietnam war, about New York in the seventies. These are the several layers of reading this film lends itself to and they are all worth the viewer's time. For this reason this is a film that must be seen several times to get all it has to offer. It can not be metabolized in one viewing. One of the best films of the  seventies.<br /><br />The BD version is very good, and quite a few extras complete an excellent deal.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Good movie. I was genuinely entertained throughout. I didn't really expect to see the aliens show up in the end. That kindve threw a little twist in things.
B005VPRG10|5.0|I want a couple more of these great models so I can have a fleet battle. The edging around the wings is an inspired piece of design. Coupled with the pieces that make the lines of the hexagon the wings are what makes this model so fine.
0061906220|5.0|This is the best book for teaching colors to children. Not only can you talk about colors in a delightful way but the message coming from this laid-back kitty is so great for the kids to hear. I downloaded the recording and play it while turning the pages of the book and teaching sign language to hearing toddlers and pre-schoolers. They just love it and it makes the teacher smile too every time I do it. Big fun this one.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I thought this was a Great movie and it is one I will watch again. I can't wait till the next one comes out!
B00866JL96|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it! I never seen Taylor Schilling before and she is beautiful. She and Zac Efron did a great job in this movie and I think they both fit the characters they played. It made the story believable, romantic, and &#34;happy-ever-after.&#34;
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|It was an OK movie. Not one of my favorites. But it was alright. I guess that I expected more out of it.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|The dancing in this movie was huge, epic, &#34;to the moon!&#34; I loved all of the dances, even the more dramatic style with Emily in her peformance at dance company. The acting wasn't that great but it wasn't terrible. I totally loved the time when they were at the art showing and the statues came alive. That took my breath away. All of the dances were beautiful, creative, and &#34;out of the box&#34; style of dancing. To me, it was a beautiful artform. It went straight to my heart.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I thought it was a great movie. It is definetely a chick flick. I will watch it again. I recommend it.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Way too funny! The aliens are so ugly but totally funny.I love MIB and MIB III. Gonna get MIB III soon.
B007ZZKWHY|3.0|Disappointed not to have full English subtitle support on disk. English subtitles appear only when somebody is speaking German. You cannot toggle subtitles either.<br /><br />You cannot toggle spoken languages either.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I use this when I don't have a good signal. In Alaska that was quite offten. I could go to the AirBase food court and download a movie to view when I was camping out. It has never let me down.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Right after installing, I got a network connection error which is nutty since I'm online at this very moment. I'm unistalling and trying out The Weather Channel app.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I was very excited to see this movie.<br />Imagine then my disappointment.<br />They took elements from Aliens 1 and 2, wrote them into a new script with pathetic dialogue, no surprises and a total lack of originality. It's one thing to use other peoples ideas and warp them into your own creation, what Mr. Scott has done is take his own ideas, chewed them up and shat them out and told everyone &#34;its a new movie, I promise it is!&#34;<br />And the ending? Oh look, they turned it into an Aliens prequill..... what a joke.<br />Watch the trailer, its the best parts all rolled into 90 seconds.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|its one of the best of this series I would recommend it I also played BTD4 but this rivals it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's an interesting game so far....I am stuck at the moment. But creepy story. Good fun! Can't wait to finish it....
B007U4DIM6|5.0|This is movie is a lot of laughs, and a great story told about what happens as Sam and Rachel begin their married life together. The Chi's are soo well written including Pedro and a visit by Delgado, as well as Sebastian the Pug acting as a party planner. Very upbeat, uplifting and fun.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|To cheap.... has no stability.  Spend more and get something better.  To difficult to hold all the pieces together while you try and cut!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Different and cute.  If you like simple free apps, this has a lil more to play with to keep you busy.  I got this as something to share with my niece an so far find it cute a d distracting.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|She has the most beautiful pitch.  I love &#34;when you walk thru a storm&#34; ?  The first time I heard it, it made me cry.<br />As a rule, I don't like show tunes, but if Les Mis is included, it's a home run.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|works great on tablets. cannot put it up , just so enchanted. background  music also adds great experience to game ambience. would recommend to my friends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, once I started, I just couldn't stop!<br /><br />Great suspense, very well described. The characters had a sense of realism that one usually does not find in works of fiction.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my son, so I sure hope he likes it! He got hooked on the Walking Dead last year (I think), so I know he hasn't seen these yet!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game but you have to spend too much money to play decently. I'm willing to spend a little money here and there but not that much.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the story line. The arthur seemed to get lost towards the end. It did not hold my interest. I will not read the rest of the books in the chronicle. But it was a good beach book.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|This program is amazing and really easy to use. I got it so I could work with my 5th grader on his homework. Now I can quickly check his work and if he gets the wrong answer we go over the work to get to the correct one. This is an amazing, worth recommending, product! Jn
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I don't have tv so watch online mostly but really enjoy being able to see a season of my favorite shows on DVD.
B006TVQU6C|3.0|The pop out sides are just for show as they are not popped out far enough to allow you to route cables behind the motherboard area.  Overall the case looks nice and can fit larger video cards due to its layout.  However, for the price there are better cases that work much better for cable management.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for...It doesn't have advertisements but it has everything you're looking for! Since it's free you can't ask for anything more.
0307951529|5.0|For me, it was very much like the 4-Hour Workweek (Ferriss) with a different twist. This book was loaded with great case studies that served as examples and inspiration for the reader. The combination of these stories and methods with those resources and techniques from 4HWW is very powerful. All the reader has to do is take action! I know I am, and I feel confident that I'll be just like one of the stories in the book. Thanks Chris, for this missing piece of inspiration that I needed!! I look forward to going to one of the World Domination Summits in the coming years! See you then!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its fun nothing up with my kindel but its fun and you can talk with friends so I don't get bored soooooooo happy for this game :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love thisgame.  The story is different, the graphics are beautiful and the HO and minigames are terrific.  Well done.  I am stuck in chapter one in the Managers Office.  I can't get the First Teeth Panal from the Cupboard because it is locked.  That is what the message at the top of the screen says when I try to open the cupboard doors,  &quot;It's locked.&quot;  I have played on to the House of Fears but without the First Teeth Panel to open the doors I am stuck.  No walkthrough and the guide does not mention a key so please any suggestions?  thanks.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|5 stars! First John Grisham book I've read, but it was full of twists and turns that kept me wanting to read more.
B004T5K3OK|1.0|Won't save my images. Waste of $5 dollars.  Keep your money, you won't regret it. sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.
0345803485|2.0|This novel is just ok. I read about a third of it and find the language trite. I get the &#34;how many ways can you use the word grey,&#34; but I have been waiting for richer language. Memories of Fanny Hill has this beat--hands down-- and it was written in the 18th century!
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Unless you spend way too much time playing games, you will get stuck on a screen, you will get bored, and you will want to just uninstall and move to a game that is less boring. Being stuck at the same screen gets old quick. So time to uninstall.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|This one of three movies in the Ice Age series and more are on the way. These are very funny movies made for the whole family. This particular movie the squirrel falls for a squirrel femme fatale. The part where she takes the acorn while they are falling is hilarious. This movie is now one of my favorites. It's funny from start to end, I would recommend anyone who enjoys pure entertainment without political correctness, and that nonsense, should watch this.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted.  It is widescreen, so pay attention when ordering!!!  The product was delivered almost overnight, undamaged and sealed.  A perfect Christmas gift for anyone that flies (or wants to)!  The movie has been rated elsewhere, Google it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was definitely better than I thought it would be. It took some turns I didn't see coming and it had a cute story line. I'd recommend this story to anyone who likes the unconventional love story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's sooooooooo much fun and it's an awesome game. I enjoy it a lot, and its kinds addicting I. LOVE IT A LOT and I will continue playing it.
0441009425|2.0|I love hard sci-fi novels, but seriously, I have no idea what this book was about or how I managed to finish it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|A good movie overall. What you'd expect from this series, action suspense etc.  The ending did leave a bit to be desired, however I suppose they're leaving it open for another movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is one of my new favorite apps! Got for the rare case I'd want to look a word up but I now use it every day. Love it
B0073LWEXK|3.0|opening graphics is fine but as you move into it over all making is kind of cheap. got it for free.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was searching for some visual candy to make good use of my new vt50. These movies are not just gorgeous, but they sound great too. Not to mention that the movies themselves have held up very well over time and provided an awesome experience!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|2 hours and 23 minutes of hero action.  Leave the politics aside and watch the Avengers come together and save the world!
B000V7FZ7U|5.0|I would recommend to CD concert to any &#34;Simply Red&#34; fan.  I saw their debut album/concert in Atlanta, and I have been a fan ever since then.  I have all their albums.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|I am not one for historical movies but felt compelled to see this movie.  This is the first time I have seen Colin Firth in a movie and I have to say that he, and all of the other actors did a superb job.  It also did a very good job of reminding me that just because you are royal, it does not mean that you will not have your own troubles to overcome.  An excellent, family movie if your children are teenagers.  It does have profanity in scenes, but it part of the speech training and not what seems to be punctuation these days.  PG13 in my home, but I don't know what the film is truly rated at, use your own standard.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great movie collection , especially for the price . A must have for any sci fi fan . All classic must have movies
B005LAIHZY|3.0|I love animation and will go to great efforts to see an animated film.  With that said, I was required to wait until this came out on DVR, I should of just rented it and not wasted my money on buying it.  Hacked together story line where it was very clear the director forgot what needed to be done and when it needed to be done.
B008J34466|2.0|too 70's punkish - seems to be singing to the young girls - voices and music pushed to the extreme.

1936891026|5.0|Excellent book! Inspiring! For everyone not just artists! Only thing wrong with this book is that it leaves me with a lot of internal questions!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Wonderful movie !  My children (28 and 25 years old) and I watch it every Christmas while decorating the tree.
048622709X|4.0|A great book! A wonderful resource for hands that will keep you coming back for reference. Not so great for learning to draw hands, but instead to better understand structure, weight, and form.
B005LAII94|5.0|Now what I like about this movie...that at the very CORE of this movie, is that it is (VERY MUCH) a knight in shining armor story. (Though maybe the knights aren't so very shiny in their armor?)<br /><br />Enter the picture the characters Ben, O and Chon.<br /><br />Now this trio all live together and all love one another. (Though I'm going to say that with Ben and Chon, it's probably one of those protracted 'bromances'.)<br /><br />I feel like they've known each other since like FOREVER--like maybe at least since high school. (In my mind, I'm sensing that Ben was more of the academic and Chon was maybe more of the jock and that one way or another, the two of them were able to forge a more or less symbiotic bond.)<br /><br />Though I guess time and space have a way of changing things. Because enter their world O--short for Ophelia (from Shakespeare).<br /><br />She develops a friendship with the two of them and eventually starts working in their grow-op.<br /><br />One thing leads to another, and boom, she's living and loving the two of them. (We the audience, don't get to see any of this, because by the time the story begins, the three of them are already together.) Like most stories, this part of the story is NEVER dealt with and I just think it would've been an interesting one to explore.<br /><br />Only that's not really what this story is about.<br /><br />What this story IS about, is how these three young people have a very successful grow-op business making some of the best marijuana on the planet. They are so successful that a certain cartel is VERY interested in joining them.<br /><br />Now of course none of them want this. They would only want to continue on with their happy existence. You know, the one where they get to live in their tricked out little love shack on the beach (that's HARDLY a shack!) and live all happily ever after.<br /><br />They would want this most definitely, only the cartel has other plans.<br /><br />This is where the story reallystarts to develop and so I won't say much more.<br /><br />What I WILL say is that the casting for this film was most inspired. LOVED the main three actors who portrayed Ben: Aaron Johnson, O: Blake Lively and Chon: Taylor Kitsch.<br /><br />They all seem like people who could really know and care about each other.<br /><br />John Travolta as the crooked DEA agent was refreshing--so used to him being just the good guy all the way. (And maybe through all of it, he DOES turn out to be good after all?)<br /><br />Salma Hayek as the head of the cartel was tough and quite believable in her role.<br /><br />And Benicio Del Toro was fierce.<br /><br />Thank you again Mr. Stone, for making probably my one of my favorite movies and CERTAINLY my favorite movie of 2012.<br /><br />You and this movie rock!!!
0307592731|5.0|We are enjoying reading this book very much. Good story, good writer. Highly recommend it to anyone interesting in hiking and the impact it can have on one.
B00846REIS|5.0|this book is a lot like the 50 shades series, i was bored when i finished 50 shades and this filled its place. great book!
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Three hours in Middle Earth pursued by orcs, pummeled by rock hurling giants, evading goblins and trolls is exhausting, but SO satisfying. The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey is close to perfect in the spirit of the book.<br /><br />It's a gentler, more playful adventure than LoTR, though the perils are no less deadly.  Martin Freeman's Bilbo is marvelous--in turns petulant, vulnerable and heroic, and his evolution from complacent comfort-seeker to resourceful rescuer is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />As good as Freeman is, Andy Serkis steals the movie.  The riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum is some of the most riveting screen time ever. Serkis SO deserves a Major Award (not a leg lamp) for his tormented, schizophrenic Gollum.  That scene alone makes this movie a must see.  All the acting is splendid and cameos from LotR characters preserve the continuity of the story, but somehow The Hobbit manages to be more FUN than was LotR.<br /><br />If at all possible, see it in 3-D. The only thing missing is smell, but after Bilbo's and Thorin's reaction to essence de goblin, that's OK. Peter Jackson never ceases to amaze, and The Hobbit is a must see.  I can't wait for the next installment!

B0085YNML2|5.0|I'm not one to typically give glowing reviews of anything, and granted I'm just 15 stages in, but this is one of the best faotd yet. If you liked Cut The Rope, you'll like this. That is not to say it is derivative, in fact it's been the game I wished CTR was where I got to move the main character instead of the food, but ymmv.<br /><br />This games loads fairly quickly on my droid 2, getting to be a rarity these days. Has great responsive controls, I always felt like failing was my fault.<br /><br />I will update the review after I play for a while in case it does not have longevity.

B008Y1YKE4|4.0|Arthur Christmas is one of the better new Christmas movies.  A humorous yet touching little story about Santa's through generations.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Game seems to be made well..  Works on Kindle Fire.  Will have to play it through.  I am not much for games, but loved the graphics.

B003NFM3JK|1.0|This is the worst version of \\"The Christmas Carol \\" I have ever seen. No seriously it really is. We rented it from Redbox first before buying thank goodness.  My kids ages 8 & 9 were horrified by the very scary to children scene's.  You can hardly understand the people talking so you have to listen very close which is very annoying. I suggest you watch it first to decide whether or not your children will be afraid or not. Oh and rent it before buying it & being stuck with it :)

B000KIE11Q|4.0|He wears it all the time. It's comfortable and keeps accurate time. It's stylish, too. That said, when we received it and had to shorten the bracelet (it was a bit loose), we couldn't understand the instructions and had to go to a Swatch store locally to get it adjusted. They did it quickly and the were very kind about it - charged us $5.00 for the work, but it was worth it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a really helpful app. If you have a kindle and go to school, its pretty good for your basic calculator.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|The book of Revelation and the book of Matthew in our Holy Bible describe many<br />horrible events to come in our future. This movie is only one of many disaster movies<br />that portray possible scenarios.<br />  The real thing though is that after the tribulation period our Lord Yahshua ( Jesus to you ) as the letter J was not invented<br />until the thirteenth century, look it up on the internet, will return to usher in the one thousand year period of peace<br />mentioned in the Bible. They should make a movie on that.<br />A good movie for fantasy buffs.<br />Respectfully,<br />Jim.
B009MO5E10|5.0|This was my I want to see a movie today, and i'll just choose this one becausethe other ones are cartoons.<br /><br />Just like other reviewers I didn't expect much going in and one word stuck in my head PREDICTABLE.<br /><br />but I haven't seen a bike movie in a long time since idolizing kevin bacon and I thought, i really gotta get over my obsession so this must be the cure.<br /><br />Gordon is slowly becoming my favorite kind of guy. He's growing into his big head quite nice and in this movie with a lot of his wonderful sarcasm and leg shots, I was clearly enjoying myself twenty minutes in the movie.<br /><br />And amazingly the movie got better after that.<br /><br />I love the cop as well. Mean and irritated. who wouldn't like that in an antagonist.<br /><br />The action and actor and the addict (gambler) really made two hours of my life really worth it.<br /><br />I'd very much recommend this delightful movie to all.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I loved this app. It gave me a chance to show off my art. I love the new design to, Its like instagram. It works brilliantly on the kindle fire. BEST APP EVER!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is one of most unsatisfying stories I have ever read. The characters are totally in unbelievable and the storyline, while superficially imaginative, is predictable. My advice to other potential readers is don't waste your time or money.
B009JBZH54|4.0|It was a very good offer, three movies on Blu ray, less than 10 bucks. and a book with pics
B0098G7AWS|5.0|This has to be one of the most well-known movies ever. With a classic story line, it could have been much cheesier than it was. It was emotional without being overbearing and it was easy to follow. I usually find myself fidgety during long movies but was captivated throughout the whole movie.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It´s led zeppelin, No words to explain anything, if you are fan no more words you need. You know. LZ.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien collection on Blu ray is awesome. Looks great and sounds great. Who would not want this collection. Doesn't take up much space on the self so that is a bonus.
0345803507|4.0|It wasn't as good as the first two. It is also written slightly different. But still a good conclusion to the series.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I have no clue how to get past the 3rd game. Nothing seems to work and I have just given it up as a waste of time and money.
1410450236|4.0|I really loved this book, and will be recommending it to my high school esl students. It is exciting and fun, I like the characters and the plot. I also love the photographs in it. There is one drawback (what I docked a star for), and that is that I sometimes got the feeling that parts were written to go with the photos. In these instances the book felt like a patchwork and not like one coherent story. In most instances, the photos add to the reading experience, though, rather than muddle it.
1616960922|5.0|I love everything about the story and I would like to see more with this character. Brandon is the best.
B00650SSDU|3.0|First the unrealistic parts:  1. You go to New York ( and you're a guy ) and a hot girl meets you there cause she's the recruiter :  Unrealistic.  It would either be a guy or an unattractive woman meeting you......likely a guy.  I get called by recruiters all the time and they're 20 - 30 somethings guys headhunting for commisions.  2. The hot girl is totally forward, friendly, waits all day for you to finish your interview so she can take you for a drink:  UNREALISTIC - in reality hot women are getting texts and phone calls on their cell phones 24 hours a day from all her male suitors she would already have because she's been living in that town for a while. So, tons of guys would be birdogging her and she wouldn't wait around for you ( a guy from out of town ) for any reason.  In the real world, hot women,like Mila Kunis are a commodity and highly sought after and usually already taken.  Also, in real life, men are the aggressors and women are more demure.  Men are like dogs and women are like cats....ie cats scare easy.  Men have to convince women to do things with them....get coffee or date.  In this movie, Justin t. has a dont give a $##$ attitude and is the one being pursued after by the hot girl.  Unrealistic....it's the other way around.  That's human nature.<br />  Justin Timberlake is so much more talented than John Mayer that he has seeming disdain for him in this movie:  UNREALISTIC - In reality John Mayer has more talent in one of his fingers than Justin T. has in his whole body.  John Mayer writes his own stuff....plays guitar like Jimmy freaking Hendrix and sings good.  Mayer's lyrics often have deep meaningful insights to life ( except for some of that obvious made for radio stuff....which I don't care for either )  Meanwhile what does TImberlake do?  Jump around on stage.....playing NO instrument....dressed in Shiny outfits and sing along to boy band songs.  Big freakin whup.  Mayer having disdain for Timberlake.....would make more sense.<br />  OK....there were some funny parts.....but the lack of what the real world is like in terms of human nature and the way women and men interact......blew it for me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is so good that it makes me so angry that it was discontinued. Where are the people of vision? At my house or is there a producer with a brain left out there?
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I am an admirer of Ian McEwan's fiction, awed by his narrative skills.  In a recent interview in the NYT, he proclaimed Atonement and Sweet Tooth his personal favorites among his novels.  So, it's with a bit of trepidation that I weigh in less enthusiastically about Sweet Tooth.  The things I liked about this this particular novel are the things that make it unmistakably McEwan. No one can match his ability to turn a perfect phrase.  His descriptive virtuosity grants the reader a microscope with which to visualize details of human behavior so subtle as to be almost indescribable:  a fleeting gesture, a change of mood, the preformed biases and perspectives that lead  each character to do what they do as the story unfolds.  His characters are engaging: they are  intelligent and accomplished, artists, politicians, journalists, etc.  Though they are intuitive, they are never quite intuitive enough, a flaw that is invariably revealed when some odd circumstance occurs that tests their ability to adapt. These situations -- a bizarre coincidence, an ethical lapse, an act of violence or mental aberrancy -- affirm the author's spectacular imaginitivity and are the main reason why his writing is so addictive.<br /><br />So here's the plot.  It's the 1970's, Cold War in full throttle, and British intelligence concocts a minor propaganda campaign (called Sweet Tooth) the intent of which is to subsidize authors whose writing depicts the West in a favorable light. Among the ripples this project creates is an unforeseen romance.  That's all fine, and an intriguing premise.<br /><br />So what didn't I like?  First, this work is an overdose of something I've already identified as McEwan's great strength.  It's overly padded with descriptive language, historical detail, and self-analysis.  Second, it's gimmicky.  At several junctures, McEwan resorts to long letters or historical narratives by his characters to advance the plot.  I have never found this to be a particularly deft methodof story-telling.  I'd rather find out what happened through evolution, not exposition.  McEwan introduces some diverting literary  devices.  For example he sprinkles the story with real-life characters  (eg, Tom Maschler and Martin Amis).  Elsewhere, the story becomes a  roman-a-clef, with real figures thinly disguised.  Most notable among these is the character of  Tom Haley, an author clearly modeled after McEwan himself.  In one really delightful little conceit, we are offered excerpts of Haley's stories appear, and they are fascinating and very McEwanesque.  Such devices may represent a literary tour de force, but after a while, I tired of the arabesques. And, contrary to many other readers, I found the ending  a bit contrived and silly. Still, I rank this a B-plus to A-minus read, and much better than most of the current entries on the NYT's best-selling fiction list.

B006I1OB0U|1.0|My wife and I are big Downton Abbey fans, as well as just about anything Julian Fellowes writes. It is an outstanding series on PBS.<br />We bought this \\"Special Christmas at Downton Abbey\\" blu-ray disk because we expected to see something more than we'd already seen during the season.<br />There is about 10 minutes--maybe less--of anything to do with Christmas on this disk.<br />In addition, the disk would not load through three attempts, and then, when we loaded a different blu-ray disk afterwards, it wouldn't load either. We finally got it to work.<br />I don't understand why anyone who has seen the series would buy this, knowing that it wasn't really a special Christmas disk at all. It just had a Christmas scene at the beginning. Further, if someone buys this who has NOT seen Downton Abbey, they will be met with characters and circumstances they know nothing about.  This is not made clear in any description of the disk.
B004SBX112|5.0|I enjoyed it the first time through and getting the 3 stars was motivating. Will updates be added. I hope so.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|This dvd is AWESOME. I purchased it to keep in my holiday collection and love the depth of Dickens as relayed through the Muppets.  I read the Dickens novel this year and find this story pretty spot on with the novel.  The priceless cherished moments and laughs are wonderful and funny.  My favorite though is to see Scrooge's heart once encrusted in stone, turn to flesh...it makes me cry every time. Excellent songs, catchy & memorable.  The narrated overview in the extras gives a good insight in how the movie was directed, constructed and played out.  If you don't have it - get it.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I purchased this is a free app of the day and it has been worth it it has the great background noise it's not too noisy with the music the graphics are nice and crisp very bright and I've enjoyed playing the game is a nice time killer before bed I think it's fun for all ages and it doesn't seem like it's taking up too much of my memory if you enjoy find the hidden object games then this is a great game for you to try out. I haven't noticed any glitches in the game other than the fact that the music sometimes breaks up during gameplay but that's not exactly distracting since you're looking for objects not listening to the background music.

B00091U1WM|5.0|After the long-dormant Star Trek franchise was revived with Robert Wise's widely anticipated but often slow-paced \\"[[ASIN:6300216802 The Motion Picture]],\\" a film that had a \\"sex with a computer\\" premise, everything was put right with this sterling follow-up effort.<br /><br />In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the \\"Space Seed\\" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.<br /><br />Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped \\"Space... the final frontier\\" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.<br /><br />Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.<br /><br />Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew. Next comes a cat-and-mouse war sequence inspired by [[ASIN:6301662954 THE ENEMY BELOW]] (1957), a battle of wits between two old adversaries in which only one will survive.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.7) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) - William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Paul Winfield, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalbanan (1982) - William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, Walter Koenig, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Paul Winfield, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban
B0085YNML2|3.0|This game is just OK. This is something I would not pay for. I installed and tried it out because it was free today on Amazon.

B002N14GPE|4.0|I had a few movies tagged to watch that while not being award winners might make for a tolerable way to spend an evening.  This was one of them.  It had been on my list for quite a while but I just couldn't get around to watching it.  I was wrong about this movie.  It wasn't what I expected.  I prefer not to write reviews that will spoil the film for anyone so I won't do so here.  I figured it would just be a rehash of the same old tale of the evil kid someone brought home.  Not the case.  The young lady playing Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, did a hell of a job in this movie.  Check it out.  I think you'll enjoy it

B00AA0TJO8|2.0|Update:the issue described below resolved after restarting. Still not crazy about the game because like so many other video games it is just a series of arbitrary puzzles. The \\"cute\\" factor wears off in about five minutes and then you are back to the underlying reality that this theoretically fun game is actually just an annoyingly pointless and illogical world of busywork.<br /><br />all the buttons you need to press are 85% below the edge of the screen on the kindle fire. I cant tell what the buttons do and it is very hard to press them because you can barely touch them. this problem is obvious. why release the game in this form?

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I'm a huge movie fan when it comes to this genre, and I have to say, the past few years have been... Less then stellar. The Walking Dead has done it again, but with a new twist; they're slowing changing the plot away from the base comics, but is way that enhances and interests viewers. Well done, great acting, recommend it to anyone who loves zombie apocalypse movies.

B0053O89Z6|5.0|Wield I feel like HIMYM has slowed a bit in this season, I still give it 5 stars... Why? Because they did what 95% of other shows don't: they tied up nearly every loose end from every season. While at times I felt like this season was disjointed, and some of the characters didn't grow, or even regressed, they have prepared for the end... IN my opinion next season could be the final hurrah. I love this show to the bottom of my heart, but I don't want this show to turn into the last seasons of ER... They need to end on a high note, and soon. I don't want to lose one of my favorite shows to the demons of poor writing, and lack of ideas. Good season, worried for the next.

0062183591|3.0|As a student in the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics course on Forensic Research and Analysis \\"The Honest Truth About Dishonesty\\" by Dan  Ariely was required reading.    [...]  The book exposed me to the study of social behaviors and what prompts people to cheat or not cheat.  Dan Ariley discusses two research studies conducted on students at MIT/Yale and Princeton.  The challenge was to see if students would cheat if they were reminded of a code of ethics or if they weren't.  Results of the study indicated that those reminded of a code of ethics were less likely to cheat.  Numerous studies are discussed throughout the book to show in what situations people would consider cheating.    Students were chosen as the subjects in most experiments since they were reported as being the most reliable candidates to resemble the general public.  Thus we are unable to see what the research results would actually be in the real world.      The various examinations conducted forewarn that no single action is a definitive indicator a person will cheat or not cheat.  A fraud investigator should consider all scientific evidence available to get a full and clear picture before developing a conclusion.

B005LAII1C|2.0|I really wanted this movie to be good and funny! I really wanted to watch this movie in a family setting. Cannot do that. I think Mark Wahlberg is a great actor and the whole story could have been really good and funny. I think \\"Invincible\\" is one of his best movies. The trailer of the movie is an example of a really good commercial for a mediocre film with too many bad and adult jokes.<br /><br />The story is simple. A boy wishes that his bear could come to life during Christmas, and guess what...it happens! And the boy grows older always living with his teddy bear. The plot is dormant all the way to last 20 minutes. I think that they made the script as they were filming the movie (like the SNL sketches) and realized that they were short and had to add more stuff. It looks like they rushed the end.<br /><br />It is a decent plot with huge potential and good acting. If you like juvenile jokes (like in the American Pie movie) then you will like the movie. However, it is NOT a PG 13 movie (as stated on the cover), and because of the language and the cruel jokes it is rated R. Cannot watch this movie with your kids. I highly doubt that a father can watch the movie with his daughter(s) and wife when in the opening scene the father complements his wife (using the bj word) of the gift she gave him last night (on the eve of Christmas) in front of their son on Christmas day while talking about presents. Really bad and inapropriate humor, for a so called family movie.  In addition, some \\"jokes\\" are really not funny and really offensive for a parent. I know that people in Hollywood are numb to some things that we parents are sensitive because of their lifestyle, but I was expecting much better from Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis who made some good clean family movies thus far (except Boogie Nights but the whole subject of the movie is porn so...). Totally embarrassing and bad jokes galore, especially in the opening scene. The Hollywood people may have to wake up and make cleaner family movies if they want to make money with the people. Otherwise they should expect to make little income since the movie will be watched in few cities on the East and West coast only.<br /><br />I will do my best to alert people about the content of these so called \\"funny\\" movies that the liberal pseudoelite in Hollywood tries to perpetrate and make it normal. Even if Amazon buries my review deep inside the 200 something other reviews, people will be able to find it.<br /><br />Two stars only because Mark Wahlberg's good performance and some good clean jokes.r family movies if they want to make money with the people.

We both hate each other and now we're having a baby,&#34; just didn't cut it for me.  I really wanted Amanda to get hers.

When she can do her own thing, she shines (as she has on all of her solo albums).  May she live forever....

B00000DHTF|4.0|Wow.  This could be a greatest hits collection for another artist.  It is really hard for me to fathom that some of these tracks could have not been chosen for inclusion on Bruce's previous releases.  Particularly impressive are the songs from his earlier period up through \\"The River\\". The four out-takes from \\"The Wild, The Innocent...\\", Santa Ana, Seaside Bar Song, Zero And Blind Terry, and Thundercrack, would all have been highlights had they been included on that album.  Four from the gap between \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\"--Don't Look Back, Ricky Wants A Man Of Her Own, Iceman, and Hearts Of Stone are all excellent.  There is an abundance of \\"rejects\\" from \\"The River\\", which really baffles me.  While I think \\"The River\\" contains some of the very best slow songs he has written (Point Blank, Independence Day, The River), a lot of the fast tempo rockers (Two Hearts, Crush On You, I'm A Rocker) always seemed like filler that the Boss could have turned out in ten minutes.  Now we hear first rate mind-blowing Springsteen rockers like Roulette, Dollhouse and Living On the Edge Of The World--what an album \\"The River\\" could have been!  I like the version of Stolen Car on \\"Tracks\\" better than the one on \\"The River\\".  I also prefer this version of Born In The USA--somehow a lot more powerful in this lower key stripped down version than the higher volume hit.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because most of the cuts on the last two discs, from the \\"Nebraska\\" to \\"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\\" era are just okay.  Oh, and if you're thinking of saving money and just getting the one cd version, forget it--a lot of the best songs aren't on it. True, it has the two tracks not on the 4 cd set, but a much better version of The Promise is available on \\"The Promise\\".
B005LAIISA|5.0|Ice Age-Continental Drift(released June/12)has the usual voice talents of Ray Romano as Manny,John Leguizamo as Sid,Denis Leary as Diego,Queen Latifah as Ellie,along with some newcomers like Keke Palmer as Peaches,Jennifer Lopez as Shira,Wanda Sykes as Granny,and even the dynamic duo of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg.This is,for my money,THE best of the series so far.It has adventure,it has excitement,it has laughs and it is all non stop family fun!<br />The story finds Scrat starting out the proceedings,as usual.This time his well placed nut begins the Continental Drift that forms the land masses we have today.This sudden change in earth tectonics has Manny,Ellie and the gang on the run for safety to the land bridge.Manny's precious Peaches has now grown up and is quite the young teenaged lady.Thrown into the mix comes Sid's family,slip sliding away in a hollowed out log.They crash into the group and only stay long enough to dump Sid's granny onto them,and then leave.<br />Before the group can reach the land bridge,Manny,Sid,Granny,and Diego are separated from the rest by a sudden upheaval of ice.As they drift away from Ellie and Peaches,Manny tells them to head for the land bridge and that they will return to find them.<br />Not long after their separation Manny and the gang`s ice flow is captured by pirates,led by an ape called Gutt.He commands a rag tag group of animals indeed,from an elephant seal to a rabbit.When they make granny walk the plank,the group spring into action and rescue her.The group escapes from Gutt but in the process sink his large ice ship.A little ways away they rescue one of Gutts crew,a female saber toothed tiger named Shira,and keep her locked up.When they reach land Shira escapes and runs to rejoin Gutt and his crew,who are in a nearby cove planning to take the current back to land in a newly acquired ice ship.With the help of some new found friends,in the forms of over sized hamsters,they trick Gutt and his gang and steal his ship from him.As Manny and the rest sail away Gutt is already creating another ship to pursue them.<br />Manny and the group reach the land bridge but at first do not find Ellie or Peaches.Suddenly a voice rings out and it`s Peaches;being held captive by Gutt,who has unfortunately beaten them home.Granny has an ace up her sleeve.On their way home she had been throwing fruit into the water to,what the group thought,was her imaginary friend.It turns out it was a ginormous whale,who she now calls upon to help.Manny and Gutt have a final showdown and Manny and his family are finally reunited.As a giant propeller,there is nothing that will get an ice boat across an ocean faster than a whale.They finally find new land,with the hamsters also joining them.The newest members of the herd are now Granny and Shira,Diego`s new girlfriend.<br />The film ends as Scrat finds his version of the lost city of Atlantis;called Scrat-lantis.Nuts abound,which he ferociously gathers up.However the centre piece is a giant nut and he is told by the elder there(Patrick Stewart) not to touch it.Scrat of course cannot fight his instincts,and lifts it up.Underneath dangles a plug.The island sinks,dries and becomes part of the south western U.S. desert.Scrat screams as the blistering heat starts to scorch him.<br />There are just so many funny and imaginative moments throughout this film as it moves from one thing to another in such fine fashion.I just loved the scene where the gang are drifting on an ice pack and Sid complains that there is so much water,and so little to drink.He takes a big gulp of sea water and swallows it.His face puckers right up as he realizes how salty it is.It is visually hilarious to see.They have added so much more voice talent to this movie along with,what looks like,some new and welcome additions to the herd.I like that.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette on its making,a look at the series so far,and a couple of musical segments.<br />All in all,what can I say,I loved this film.It has a pace like no other in the franchise and it just never stopped moving throughout.The film is chock full of imaginative storytelling,adventure and its requisite sight gags.It is also a film the whole family can watch together and understand.Recommended highly.uple of musical segments.<br />All in all,what can I say,I loved this film.It has a pace like no other in the franchise and it just never stopped moving throughout.The film is chock full of imaginative storytelling,adventure and its requisite sight gags.It is also a film the whole family can watch together and understand.Recommended highly.

B0090SVDO0|5.0|Live Doors is always good! I love the CD. Just saw the concert on VH1 classics. You can tell this concert was important to them as Jim was sober(not drinking alcohol anyway). They went about the show very professionally and rehearsed. It's amazing to think that just exactly 3 years later Morrison was dead. Poetry and music has never been combined quite like the Doors did it all those years ago.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Some say Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are the best trilogies.  I beg to differ.  Chris Nolan has forever changed the standard as how we view the superhero and how the same story we've heard again couldn't have been told better.  Bale will be hard to top as Batman for decades to come.  DTS-HD MA Audio cranks out at 5-6 Mbps at times, killer bass track and excellent for anyone wanting to show off their surround system.

B007Y36K46|5.0|Not since \\"Jurassic Park\\" and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy has a movie so captured my imagination and restored my love for cinematic storytelling. There are plenty of undeserved scars on this movie's reputation, thanks to too much groupthink and snarky critics who disdain pulp science fiction. There was no excuse for such a magical movie to receive such ill treatment.<br /><br />What shocked me most was the emotional involvement I had toward the story unfolding onscreen. When we discover Carter's tragic past and see him resolve to protect others, or see Dejah on the edge of tears with no idea of what she should do to save her people, it struck me in a way I never expected. By the time this movie finished, John Carter and Dejah Thoris were my friends. I was with them, on Mars, feeling what they felt. I still can't explain how it happened, and it is probably just me who felt that sort of connection. All I know is that John Carter had me caring for these two people as surely as if they were family.<br /><br />When it comes to spectacle, the special effects and musical score are unparalleled. CGI and the emotionally potent music are used to supplement the story and enhance its epic scope, instead of distracting from some inherent emptiness.<br /><br />Does the movie have its flaws? Sure, but I hardly noticed them. Yes, the adventures of Carter are often \\"silly,\\" and it hardly ever gets its science right. That's not the point. I don't see how these complaints should be brought up again, when the movie (like the book) is meant to give us adventure and wonder, and stoke the fires of imagination. In my honest opinion, it is one of the best answers we have ever gotten to that favorite question of science fiction and fantasy writers: \\"What if?\\"

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game is very good and challenging.  AGreat past time for something fun to do.  I really enjoyed playing it.
B007RE0SCW|4.0|Simple, but still very cute monster high doll alternative, for a good price. Great for a present for all kids ages.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|If you love the series, keep it up and buy this season.  Good package and set up.  Easy to scroll through episodes to pick the one you want to see if you don't want to watch all the episodes on a disc.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series. It's hard to put these books down; what a great story. The movies are really well done too.
0525952926|5.0|Have read more than half of this book already.  It is just as great as the first book.  So glad it is finally available.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the best comic book movie of all time..or untill the JLA movies come out but the puny avengers movie makes the GREEN LATERN movie look epic.even BATMAN&ROBIN was better then the avengers. after you see TDKR you will never see it the same way again. it gets better every time you see it. unlike the avengers you can only see once a year or untill your bored out of your mind...i give TDKR MOVIE 10 OUT OF 10.<br />PICTURE 10 OUT OF 10. SOUND 10 OUT OF 10. EXTRAS 9 OUT OF 10. TDKR IS PICTURE OF THE YEAR 2012
B006FE83UE|5.0|What a wonderful movie. To Kill a Mockingbird is a real classic.  Now I can watch it whenever I want to.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have a collection of Harry Bosch paperbacks-so, I must love the character; I imagine a Humphrey Bogart type character when I read the books; only much more handsome, of course!! keep 'em coming Michael.
1449410243|2.0|Definitely not as funny as Simon's cat or even Catbert in the Dilbert cartoons. The whole Bob cats section was a waste of space, and I found myself forcing a chuckle here and there to make myself feel better about buying this lame book. Don't waste your money!
B008645YEE|5.0|Thanks, Product came on time.  I really have to write a review of every little purchase I make.  Thats really dumb.
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun game. I done rate many games, but this one deserves it. Not too challenging, but not too easy either.
0062213423|5.0|Everything was in perfect condition. Not a single scratch marks or rip. I am very very happy with my purchases
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game never worked.  After it downloaded, I eagerly booted it up.  It played the video introduction after which I assumed it would take me to the main menu.  However, every time that it completed the video introduction, the game just quit and I was sent back to my Kindle Fire homepage.  Waste of 99 cents.  Very upset with Amazon charging me money for a game that doesn't work.
B00004SRJB|4.0|A true Wu Tang soldier. His debut is smashing. This album is good for people that don't mess around, people that like quality music.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I have to agree with other reviewers - the game suffers from lack of zooming capability. The screens are beautifully detailed, but even on my 10&quot; Thrive I had trouble seeing many objects and some were hard to select because of their small size and nearness to the edge.<br /><br />The puzzles also became somewhat repetitive. Other times I felt rather lost as to what I was aiming for - what was the picture supposed to be on the jigsaw type puzzles? How did it fit into the story?<br /><br />Over all I did enjoy playing the game, in large part because it wasn't violent. I'm not playing these games for great literary insight anyway. (Although matching the game characters to Harry Potter was fun!)
B000000OUJ|5.0|What can I say? I have to say this is gold! GZA is a genius just like his name says. He is aware, smart, and on point!
B00000JPH6|5.0|excellent.....clever animation and a good story line as well...really a lot more than a children's movie...some darker aspects could alarm little ones
B00005U2LM|3.0|I like Flava Flav's appearance a lot.  Maybe not their best album but good still. I usually like to listen to the whole discography if I like the artist. This album will not disappoint.
125000568X|5.0|how could anything to do with queen be anything but absolutely top-rate...well-presented and researched...too heavy to read in bed, so a great coffee-table book and quite attention-grabbing
B0000024LN|3.0|I was raking leaves and bang this on my ipod. It is a hip hop head's pal. You can tell that Redman is a real steward of the game.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Love the movie, good for children and adults.  Able to watch multiple times.  Very good family friendly adventure. 5 stars from me.
B00001IVOR|5.0|not of the exact same caliber as their first but very good though. it's raw and powerful with mind blowing lyricism and amazing beats.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I love the show, love the music.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is \\"Fade Into You\\" is missing.  Yes, I could go to iTunes and buy it for $1.29 but I shouldn't have to.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed the suspense while reading this book.  I look forward to Gillian Flynn's books.  I am going to puchase more of her books.
B005EI86JU|5.0|Great to read together with the manual. They complement each other. Helps to understand expert functions in nikon d 7000.
B0090O07RS|4.0|Big Doors Fan, Awesome to see James Douglas Morrison and the boys do their thing on Beautiful Blu Ray. I would reccomend this DVD to any doors fan out there.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Does any one no when the update comes out o it's a awesome game it's a must buy for all gamers
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Everyone listen if you have insomnia this app is a must have!! It really works please please download this app I don't have to spend nights looking at the ceiling anymore!!!
377571622X|4.0|You start to look at his photos, and imagine - he has lucky to capture such a special moment. Then you read his book, or watch his movie to understand what really happens during his photography shooting sessions. If you want to take photography serious, you need to read this book... Nothing in his photos is not calculated! Great book!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I had fun,  and was challenged as I went along! This game is easy to start, but really makes you work as you advance through the various levels!
B009FB3XTA|3.0|I love all the other soundtracks; this one  was just a little too slow moving compared to the  other ones
0061719544|5.0|It was entertaining! He is so funny but truthful at the same time. It was a very good read. Like,Like,Like
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This brilliant film seems to me a blend reminiscent of \\"1984\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", and a \\"Tale of Two Cities\\". It is a grim social satire and commentary not only of past myth (as intended by the author), actual events of the past (Roman Colosseum and many others), but could conceivably happen in this or similar form in the future. Very scary but too close for comfort. (Think of the New York financiers who partied and got huge bonuses while the rest of mainstream USA suffered during the recent recession.) Well worth seeing and carefully reflecting upon. Outstanding for all ages over perhaps twelve.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is installed on all my computers and devices. Start notes on one, retrieve and update from another.<br /><br />Wish they had a database module or feature so it can be used for collection of comic books and other hobbies.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|This as a fantastic book and arrived in great condition. The ending is horrible but I had to get it anyways because the rest of the book is fabulous.
B00973CGXK|2.0|It's OK, not as exciting as their earlier music, but OK workout album. Sounds too much like a Springsteen album from the 1980's.
B007V508CC|5.0|This was a very good product and it was in great condition when I got it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Maroon 5.
8590379825|5.0|When I bought this book, as soon as I opened it I fell in love.  It brought back memories of how wonderful the K&R book on C was.  If you want to learn Lua, and you enjoy a no-nonsense approach to learning a language, this book is for you.  There's not a single page wasted.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|it is 2.99 already on kindle fire but then it makes you pay an extra 1.99 to get more worlds. I love the game itself but the prices need to go down. but still an amazing game. I &lt;3 the game ...... I don't &lt;3 the prices....
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another wonderful Bosch novel, Connelly teases you with the clues and you only put the pieced together precisely when he wants you to.
0553381709|5.0|The world the author has created lives on in this squeal. More questions will be answer and more questions will come up. You better have book 4 handy when you read the end of this. The last pages practically make you want to open book 4 immediately!
0449227421|4.0|The Third Twin was not one of my favorites of Ken Follett.  Usually with his books,  I never want to put it down.  It is still a good read for anyone who like suspense and mystery.
B004R1Q0WU|4.0|This is a great reference guide for those just starting to quill, and provides inspiration for those who are more ambitious as well. I did a small piece right after receiveing the hard copy in the mail, and am looking forward to crafting more polished and merchandisible finished products. Although mine is a first-generation Kindle, I am able to see everything in colour via the apps on both my phone and desktop computer. The hard copy makes a lovely table-top book as well! An excellent addition to my craft library!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Read it, the text speaks for itself.<br />So enlightening and sad, yet refreshing. A beautifully tragic and bittersweet story. I fell in love with Enzo from page 1.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|The horribly cheesy aphorisms that are sprinkled throughout this book make it difficult to take seriously. Imagine Tuesdays with Morrie without the humor. The story was good enough and the descriptive bits were well-written but when you see variations on \\"beginnings can happen more than once, even in different ways,\\" every other chapter it gets tiresome.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This movie is crazy. I completely did not expect that the little girl was what she was and honestly there's nothing more I can say. It kept me at the edge of my seat and the ending was nice. I'd definitely recommend.
B000YDCFRE|5.0|its compliment after compliment with this pair of timbos.  i messed up by getting a half size larger than usual tho
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this with the hopes it would work as a sound mike for my wife's singing.  But it just wasn't up to task.  It wasn't picking up vocals and you couldn't crank it up enough without getting feed back.  It really would work better with a head frame to get it closer to the mouth but she wouldn't let me clip the alligator clip to her nose, so that idea went out the window.  However, it worked wonderfully well on my 12 string acoustic guitar that didn't have a pickup.  I clipped the mic onto the bridge, sliding the clip under a couple of strings in the middle of the bridge to secure it.  The mike was aimed toward the sound hole and does a a great job of amplifying my guitar.  It's not in my way as I play, and the audience in the coffee shop I play in said the sound was great.  Just one less big mike in my way when I play now.  Great price and I'd buy it again.  I told my buddies about it and they're going shopping.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Outstanding writing and character development.  Much better than Hunger Games or most of the more recent books made into movies.
0811876373|5.0|I've made cake pops a few times and love the idea of how many ways there are to decorate them.  This book is full of color photographs of different cake pop designs, and also shows the reader how to make them.  It starts out with a general guide to making cake pops (such as materials and how best to dip them in chocolate) and then moves into specific designs.<br /><br />Each design has step-by-step instructions that are quite useful.  Through the many designs, the reader can also pick up many skills for decorating cake pops to look like other things (ex: you can use cookie cutters to get more complicated shapes, which is shown in the cupcake how-to).<br /><br />All in all, this is a great book to have for any amateur cake pop maker.
0307001369|5.0|My grandson is going to love this! Richard Scarry's books are great for children. I still have my son's favorite from when he was a child.
0307352145|5.0|This was recommended on another website as a validating book for introverts and it really was for me.  I hesitate to use the word &#34;life changing,&#34; but it was so refreshing to know so many famous, intelligent, creative people as well as ordinary men and women like me, consider themselves introverts--proud introverts at that!  I kept underlining passages for those times when I'm down on myself for being described by my friends and co-workers as a &#34;wall flower&#34; and &#34;too quiet.&#34;
B005IQZB14|5.0|So very glad that I didn't know this was an \\"Oprah\\" book, prior to reading it, as I probably would not have done so, had I known first;'nuff said on that subject! Reading this account of one's amazing adventures was so very easy to do. Seeing and feeling with the author, came quite naturally, especially the section relating the euthanizing of the horse...I cried. Sharing the shocking parts of the journey (heroine, sex) were appreciated, in that they added credibility to the author's intent to 'tell all' - the good, the bad, and the ugly.
030759565X|4.0|I had slightly different expectations after hearing about this cookbook, but still, the ideas are creative..but perhaps a bit fancy for the cooking I do on a routine basis.
B0053O89YM|5.0|This show is one of the best lawyer-ing shows on TV.  Great acting, writing, plots.  I was disappointed with the quality of the DVDs.  Each one has 3 or 4 shows on it and the discs were damaged so that the last show on each disc skipped around and we were never able to see it in its entirety.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Very idicting, and I highly recommend this to angry bird fans. This cute animated mini game allows you to guide Munch, the chameleon, to get all the stars and eat the grub. One the funnest games I've bought; hope you enjoy!
B000002IMG|5.0|The New Order was an album that had to grow on me. I loved The Legacy and I didn't think any other album they would release could actually top the debut. Well its been a while since I've listened to this album and I'm glad to say it has grown on me...more than The Legacy. In fact, for '88 this is a pretty killer release. If you look at 1988 in review with this release and compare it to the likes of say, And Justice For All, So far...So good...So What! South of Heaven, ect. ect. You can see that this album stacks up with the best from this era. So anyone that says this is a second tier thrash band, you should do a little research. Possibly one of the few albums in '88 that could top this one would be Violent Restitution from Razor. Chuck Billy once again shows he can scream, wail, growl, yell, and actually sing. The solos are some of the best the band has released. Without a doubt Alex Skolnick is one of the most underrated lead guitarists in metal. The solos on Into The Pit and The Preacher are amazing, especially the fact that no one knows who this guy is. If you like metal, or more specifically thrash you have to get this one. There is something about this album and the way that it flows together that I can't describe.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Love the game,very addictive. After playing and building a large town,it now freezes and wont change season. When i try to open mail or plant anything but corn it will turn off and end game. I can not puchase anyting from the higher priced end of store. Need to be able to fix I don't want to start over to fix it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Enjoyed the book - based on the title the beginning was what I expected.  Looking forward to reading more books by this author.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I hate this<br /> I di  not really get this.because at the end<br />He thinks he is alone but that is not true
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|challenging but not overly diffiicult. I am enjoying it and can't wait to see how the story ends. worth the time and effort.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game rocks it is chalanging hard and a whole lot fun<br /> to play I love it I recommend this game<br />2
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|Each year the product content gets more disappointing while the price to purchase increases. I am contemplating other options for next year
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I've been a reader of science fiction and a fan of Asimov for about 45 years. Pebble In The Sky was the first SF book that I remember. I re-read a bunch of his books recently, including the entire Foundation series, and was surprised that they didn't hold up to my memories of them, though they were still enjoyable reads.<br /><br />The Gods Themselves is different. I think it is one of the greatest SF books of all time. His development and portrayal of the alien species is simply unforgettable. His humans have always seemed to me like the  humans in the Toy Story movies, not quite relaxed, not as real as the animated toy characters. But he sure gets inside the head of an alien in a perceptive and natural way.
B001E25MBK|5.0|Sure Godfather III isn't that awesome, but this set at this price with the DVD extras is worth it to see in HD
B0059XTU1S|4.0|Ever since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" ended, fans have been clamoring for \\"The Hobbit\\" to be adapted as well.<br /><br />Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" the first part of a trilogy of \\"Hobbit\\" movies. It has some few flaws, but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.<br /><br />Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...<br /><br />At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.<br /><br />It took me two viewings of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd, and the second time I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of \\"The Hobbit\\" (plus chunks of \\"Unfinished Tales\\") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.<br /><br />And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. It's brilliant.<br /><br />He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.<br /><br />However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.<br /><br />But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.<br /><br />And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast!<br /><br />The comedy can be a bit grating, but \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.urney. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love this app it is always helping me edit so many of my pictures it also makes my pictures look brighter and darker.
B0086700CM|1.0|Ok,  people don't even play temple run any more. It 's old. People who are teens know play songpop. If you haven't played songpop yet, it is so much fun,  and I would highly recommend it.
B005DD7H50|4.0|This was a fast paced movie with an interesting plot.  I was lost in the story line and trying to figure out the mystery of what would happen next.  I watched it alone and I was jumping out of my seat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Half way through and I am hooked!  Great storyline, great scenes, great mix of tasks!  Well worth the 3 bucks!  Nice and creepy!  Just my kind of game, maybe yours too!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider solitaire is a fun, fast game that does not require wifi so it can be played anywhere you are. With the choice of ramdom or a winning hand dealt,  even young children can play and learn their numbers at the same time.
B000F8O2OM|4.0|Only wish it was available on Blu-ray.  One disk had a bad spot in it.  I'll definately be replacing these with blu-ray when they come out.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was so good I read it in 24hrs. I can't wait to read the next one. Very nicely written.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The dark knight series is in my opinion the best batman movies.  There is humor without being cornball.  Batman is finally taken seriously.  The price on the trilogy was excellent.  At under $30, was well worth waiting for the last movie to come out before getting the blu-ray's.
B007REW8DO|5.0|I love Christina Perri's Lovestrong album. Se has a great way of writing and singing the songs with meaning.I can't wait for her next album to be released.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We love this app.  Seemingly simple it makes you really think how to solve the \\"flow\\".  I could actually get my husband to play this game!  While you are connecting the colors you have to be thinking ahead on what your next move is.
0525952926|5.0|I love some of the characters, sometimes there is just someTMI for me, especially the gruesome war details.  I can't put the book down once I start reading, I stay up way to late sometimes.  so looking forward to book 3.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the book as I always enjoy Ken Follett. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B005SZADQS|4.0|The shows is a new take on the supernatural. Interesting to watch but not very scary as I thought it would be.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is very fun and addictive. I would like for the prices of the upgrades to be cheaper but what can you do. I would recommend this to others
1469984202|5.0|Honestly, this story already has over 2,000 5-star reviews. How many more do you need? If one more will help, I absolutely recommend reading Wool Omnibus. The story is incredibly unique with characters and plots that made my heart pound, made my brain work overtime on the fantastic puzzles, and made me go through a teenage girl-esque range of emotions. I just can't imagine that whoever reads this won't love it. Impossible!
B008FIHUDO|1.0|There's a reason why this old dark soul has remained in obscurity........her talents, that of a dime store washerwoman, come a dime a dozen. Marlena Shaw said it best years ago, &#34;Who is this bitch anyway?&#34;<br />Her gravelly, alcoholic-laced groans for a voice is like a cold sore you accidentally pour salt on. It makes you wanna holla and not in a good way. Lavette honey.......pack it in and go back to the oldest profession where you once triumphed greatly!
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you love the Christopher Nolan Batman series, you should definitely buy this Trilogy pack.  Its a great deal and you get all three movies!

0316228532|1.0|I have to admit that I never read any Harry Potter novel, even found the movies somewhat boring. Having said that, I was so looking forward to what the author would do with an adult novel. She can write, no doubt about it, however why she seems to revel in these dark and disgusting characters and scenes is beyond me. Except for the poor little toddler, who is horribly abused as all the adults in his life fail him, there is no one who seems to have any redeeming qualities. The british underclass is portrayed as criminal, drug addicted, foul mouthed and lacking any compassion or ounce of responsibility. The middle class denizens of the town do not fear much better. They are portrayed as greedy, crooked, selfish, child abusing folks. I could not really enjoy this novel, because it was so dreary, OTT incidents, rape, incest, ugly characters and no bright light at the end of this long slog of a novel. Husbands disliked wifes, wifes hated husbands, and the teens are hating almost everyone who is an adult. Could the author not have found one single human being in this fictional town, that I could admire or want to care about? J.K. Rowling penned a novel that might appeal to some, but I believe the majority of readers will be whoefully disappointed by this book. Overpriced, overrated, not a novel you'll want to read twice!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|its all I need to get around my new town I just moved to il. and it gets me to were I want to go
B000ID37RM|5.0|If your child has not seen this movie yet, they should, if only to understand the South in the 1930's and how attitudes towards racism have (hopefully) changed. The book is a life changing book and the movie is almost as good as the book. If you have not seen this movie, in order to be \\"culturally literate,\\" you must see this.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Loved the old version so when it asked me to update I did.  Huge mistake - refuses to load.  I have waited for up to half an hour with no luck on 2 different accounts.  If you have the old version do not update.  If you don't do not purchase.  Will be uninstalling.  Am on Kindle Fire.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Sure it's about zombies BUT it's mostly about the living people trying to survive.  Great show!!!  I highly recommend it!
0307951529|5.0|Do you want to read a step-by-step guide to creating a pre-packaged business? This book is not for you.<br />Do you want to be inspired to design your own unique lifestyle, where you create the rules and learn on the job (therefore no-one can even guess what a step-by-step guide would look like but you?) - then you must read the $100 Startup! Enjoy :)
B00005JLF5|5.0|Another group of episodes to add to my collection.<br /><br />The disks were in good condition and all played without any problems
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|amazing little app. if you enjoy fantasy, these lil dragons will steal ur heart and ur sleep! such a cute little game and it &quot;mostly&quot; free!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|works great. better than standing in chuckee cheese and spending $. love it... don't need to buy coins just wait for it to refill.
0345455681|2.0|My two stars are based not on the narrative itself, but on the fact that this book (at least in the Kindle edition) is shamefully poor in terms of editing and proofreading.  There are commas where there should be none, no commas or periods when needed, quotation marks opened and closed inappropriately, and so on.  It's incredibly annoying and distracting. This may seem like a minor quibble, but if I'm going to spend my time reading a 1200 page book, it should at least be grammatically correct. Is that too much to ask for, Ballantine Books?
