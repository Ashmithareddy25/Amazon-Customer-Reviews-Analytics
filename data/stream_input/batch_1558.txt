1602839158|4.0|Nearly 500 reviewers already weighed in on this ambitious novel's wide range of settings, diverse characters, and sprawling, time-leaping plot. Everything from a oddly appealing if annoying kleptomaniac in a fine opening vignette to an Asian dictatorship to an African safari, with lots of New York City, even after climate change, terrorist fears, and more economic collapse, where people keep having babies. Music plays a key role, if not as much as I thought it would (seeing the title cribs from Elvis Costello), and the plot shifts more to fame, fear, and longing, more universal concerns among its unsettled cast of urban and suburban yearners, obsessed with gadgets, social networking exponentially amped into \\"parrots,\\" and with a familiar litany of angst and dreams, conveyed best of all if unexpectedly in one decaying, parched California high-desert exurb in a poignant chapter related through a girl's Power Point.<br /><br />The plot's all over the place, literally. Latch on to an appealing young woman on the make and a chapter later, it's another time and another generation. Jennifer Egan manages to keep all her storylines folding into each other, but readers lacking patience may wonder at her intricacy. For me, it worked as entertainment, with the attempted rapist, a journalist in eerie thrall to a despot, and the foibles of journalism best succeeding. However, the African interlude failed to keep my interest, even if I understood why it had its place in character development. For all its range, you can still see the seams showing now and then within the construction. Egan puts a lot of energy into juggling a lot of balls in the air at once.<br /><br />I chose to hear this with Roxana Ortega's dramatization. (The Power Point's via a click-through slide-show with a quaint projector sound on the tape.) Her often ironic, sneering, blustery, or fragile voice captures effectively the brash attitude of the passel of these often snobbish, insecure, and/or privileged folks, scrabbling their way up the social ladder in cities and exurbs, as the planet weakens under global warming and the media-driven frenzies escalate. Underneath it all, it's a comedy of manners two hundred years after Jane Austen, perhaps., scrabbling their way up the social ladder in cities and exurbs, as the planet weakens under global warming and the media-driven frenzies escalate. Underneath it all, it's a comedy of manners two hundred years after Jane Austen, perhaps.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|This is actually a 4 star movie but I had to give it 5 to try to bring up the average, cuz it's a really good show.  If you're not a fan of sci-fi, then sure you're gonna give it 1 or 2 stars.. But for the rest of us it's a fun one to watch.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|So graphic and hard to watch for me. My husband loved. The actors did a great job I thought. I liked the unfolding of their inter-selves as they worked to survive.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first glance, the concept might seem simple to most users, but it can be very addicting to all audiences, young and old. Even the simple controls cab be mesmerizing: &quot;Simple to learn, yet hard to master.&quot; The moment I first played this game, I couldn't put it down. Not recommended for people with extreme video game cravings, but highly recommended for killing a lot of time. Good job, Imangi.
030758836X|4.0|I love a good mystery - one that keeps me interested and wanting to know more.  I finished this book in less than three days.<br /><br />I did not particularly like either of the main characters, but I get the impression that I wasn't supposed to.  It makes the book more interesting because you never know whose side you're on.  I liked the writing style; she moves between the Dunnes effortlessly.  I liked getting to see their quirks and flaws from a personal and outside view.<br /><br />I'm sure the ending annoys lots of people, but I think it suits these two just fine.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much it is fun and addictive you wont be able to put it down yeaya
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun but then after you get all the apps on it there is nothing to do with it
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Breaking Bad has got to be hands down the most addicting television series ever made! Amazing writing and acting come together for action that will Krupp you guessing and on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this series, but if you haven't watched before, you've got to catch up on seasons 1-3 first!
006197806X|5.0|an awesome sequal to delirium that has you on the edge of your feet. there is way more action in this book than delirium. but the end is big cliff hanger.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot.  Watched twice.  Slow and captivating, interesting.  I like period pieces.  If you're looking for action, this is not the movie to watch...
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I am enjoying going through Next Gen, however I caution you that there is no table of contents or index.  That is my great disappointment with this collection.  Additionally, the episodes appear to not be in original order (as their numbers presumably were).  The case is rather flimsy, but the content is there.  The producer of this collection should print a title and subject index of the episodes - and make it available to prior purchasers!
0380729407|1.0|A carnival comes to a small town.  Mr. Dark presides over it.  He starts to spread evil over the town.  Only two young boys--James Nightshade and William Halloway--are aware of it and try to save the town.<br />I had to read this in college.  I looked forward to it.  I liked Bradbury's short stories very much.  Unfortunately this is virtually unreadable.  Bradbury seems to like showing off how smart he is and renders most of the descriptions of places and things in flowery, overdone language.  More often then not I had to reread a sentence multiple times before I understood it!  This is a perfect description of the word \\"pretentious\\".  The sad thing is this has all the elements of a good horror story.  The description of Mr. Dark's carnival works (when you can understand it) and the Dust Witch \\"marking\\" the two kids houses is downright horrific.  There's also the ferris wheel that ages a person at each spin.  This is all creepy stuff but Bradbury seems more intent on showing how intelligent he is than making a coherent story.  Too bad.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is excellent, very thought provoking and memorable. Written from the perspective of Death, it looks at war in a very moving way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|such a simple concept and yet challenging and addictive! my 6 year old loves it too! great time waster as well!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its really fun. I'm on level 6. its better than the smurfs village.I like when there is all the families
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't tell you the last book I'd read. I finished this book in 3 days...i couldn't put it down. The fantasy of the book was amazing. I found myself daydreaming through out the day about Christian and Ana. I am so glad this is a trilogy...I'm on to the next! I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />If you are some sort of literry intellect looking for a compelling novel this is not it. If you are looking for some light fantasy \\"escape\\" reading this is it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it a lot it is so much fun you should download it it is a lot of fun its a great game
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game.  I'm a huge fan of Paradise Island and this game is almost as fun.  keeps you coming back for more.  I like very much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really loved this series!  It was hard to put down at times.  It is a love story first of all.  It is a full of fantasy and suspense.  It was a real page turner for me.  I really hope that the author continues with a fourth book in the series.
B0040GUE38|2.0|Having read the Stanislaw Lem book and having seen the Tarkovsky film of the same name, I was curious what Hollywood would do to the material.  They have made a thorough mess of it, adjusted the plot badly, and altered the ending in a way that doesn't make sense. The performances, however, are fine. The 1972 Tarkovsky version unfolds very slowly (which may make some people crazy) and makes very effective use of a minimal budget, but builds to considerable power. It's a haunting film and thought-provoking, and is far truer to the book.  I had hoped the 2002 Soderbergh version would at least make use of Hollywood's considerable CGI abilities to give a visual rendition of some of the strange formations that the Solaris ocean comes up with, but no such luck.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was curious about this series because of all the talk and purchased the first book.  I figured if I didn't like the book, I could just delete it.  I thought the author did a good job in getting the reader to discover and like the characters.  No doubt that the story is erotic.  If a person is too embarrased by this sort of reading, then they shouldn't buy this book.  I personally liked this first book enough to buy the entire series. It is a fantasy love story and I truly enjoyed it!
0142418471|5.0|We bought this book because it was assigned as summer reading for my son, a rising 8th grader.  He read it in less than three days!  I was intrigued, so I picked it up too.  Some parents had complained that it was not appropriate for this age group, and I wanted to judge for myself.<br /><br />The two areas that I could see parents being concerned about are homosexuality and cursing. While two major characters are gay, and issues of sex, sexuality, and homosexuality are integral to the plot...in a larger way, this is NOT what the book is about. And, there is a fair amount of cursing, but IMO it's about the amount of cursing that kids say/hear.  There is no actual sex, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence.<br /><br />What the book IS about is friendship and love and betrayal and identity....the very issues that young teens are struggling with and the issues much of young teen literature deals with.  These themes are handled well, the book is written well, and the characters are interesting and engaging (to me AND to my son).<br /><br />And, I have to admit that I was grinning ear to ear at the end of the book - I was that engrossed in the story, that invested in the kids.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Having just seen \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RISES\\", I can honestly say it ranks at the top of that short list of \\"Must See Movies\\". Christopher Nolan has outdone himself, tho I did not think that was possible after seeing the first two Batman movies he made.<br />This is not a movie to be missed, because there will not be anymore \\"BATMAN\\" movies of this caliber, ever! The movie ends on a bittersweet note, but I found it to be appropiate and relieved that it did not end the way I thought it was going to.<br />Just go and see the film and judge for yourself, it really is moviemaking at it's absolute finest, you won't be disappointed.............
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was looking for something to read and I saw a huge number of positive reviews on iBooks.So I bought the book.<br /><br />I was surprised at the poor writing when I started reading it. I thought it was intentional as part of the story. I was wrong. It didn't get any better.<br /><br />I think we used to call these \\"penny horribles\\". It is not well written - I had just finished reading Stegner's \\"Crossing to Safety\\" so maybe I was expecting too much!<br /><br />I should have read the reviews on Amazon - I would never have bought the book!
006621131X|5.0|this book shows the world how we could live poetically, how much can a love be generous and pure, intimately pure and romantic, how much can tow souls be merged into art and follow their path separately but together till death comes.<br />I wish every reader to live such a kind of tie once in their life.<br />pictures inside are little pieces of an entire universe of feelings, emotions and ways of being.
160309007X|1.0|This series has deteriorated more with each volume. The last one (The Black Dossier) was nearly unreadable. This new one has almost none of the charm of the first two collected editions. The art is still fine, but I think Mr. Moore has lost that spark that prevented his work which usually involves characters created by other authors, from just being glorified fan fiction. With the setting now contemporary he's having to resort to homage and satire where he was able to use public domain characters before, allowing for even more cynical but less, care to his social commentary. There is no fun in these books anymore. Read the first two and then get off the ride, try Tom Strong or Planetary.
B008MEM24S|5.0|just like where's my water except in someways easier. u gt to go through steam in the first section not 7<br /><br />great app I recommend it
B008BM9L72|4.0|This is not my usual genre of books, i guess you could say I got caught up in all the chatter !! Having said that, to my amazement i actully enjoyed all of the books in the series & was quite bereft when I had read them all. The S&M did'nt detract from the story or make it seem  \\"dirty\\" ! The books are really just a \\"love story\\" with a twist . :)
0374203032|5.0|Well-written and provocative. What is the market doing to our humanity?<br />We may answer differently, but at least we will have given it some consideration.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|A good slow ride that builds gradually,enough so,that you want the other two books.characters are well written especially Glokta!! Easy to follow and it ends( no cliffhangers)!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I know nothing of Frank Ocean...however the music that he delivers here is at once haunting, lush and ornate. I couldn't stop listening to it! Highlights are in no particular order : Sweet Life, Pink Matter & Bad Religion. Give this young man a try..I don't believe you'll be dissapointed.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Watched this in Germany. What a wonderful, touching and funny movie. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This movie is worth owning!
B005LAII0I|4.0|There are only so many ways one can expect to have the tale of \\"Snow White\\" retold without it just becoming a retread.<br /><br />\\"Sydney White\\" was one remarkable example of outside-the-box thinking, but here, \\"Mirror Mirror\\" chooses to stick with the period instead of modernizing the setting, and veers off the familiar path through the woods to explore some other aspects of the characters involved.<br /><br />Without any spoilers, the Queen's vanity-driven blood lust becomes more understandable (if no less unforgivable); Snow White's cruel domestic treatment leads not to her devolving into a mindless nymph who is happy to set up house with seven strange little forest-dwellers, but rather a young woman of remarkable strength and tenacity; and the Prince... well, while he still remains a pretty face with a great body for stylish clothes, he does for once become an actual human with passions and foibles, making him more than just eye candy but another hero to root on in this comic saga.<br /><br />The cinematography is top-notch, as is the acting and writing. The Dwarfs -- each one proving to be a skilled comic actor -- easily run off with huge chunks of their scenes.<br /><br />This is not inappropriate for family viewing by any stretch, but this caters to a higher sense of humor. It's Grimm Grows Up, and I'd rank this as palatable and a very pleasant choice for a popcorn-and-comedy night at home.<br /><br />The film loses one star in my rating for overuse of the mountain of gold fabric that was obviously bought in bulk, a swatch or several yards of which were shoe-horned (\\"Blue Ball Gown? White portrait collar? STICK A FIVE-FOOT GOLD BOW ON THE BACK, WE STILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF BOLTS OF THAT GODDAMNED SHINY GOLD CRAP TO USE UP!\\") into every single costume...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought all 3 Grey books were amazing! I loved each of them and fell in love with the characters and their story throughout the books. SO GOOD!!!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This lights very brightly with your camera flash LED, or flips to use your screen.<br /><br />In the screen mode, you have your choice of infinite colors, selected via color wheel, and can even produce a rich enough purple to very closely produce Black Light illumination for viewing day-glo colors.<br /><br />Worth every one of the no pennies I spent on it.
030758836X|3.0|The writing saves this rather ho-hum mystery. Though some will call it a thriller, it's not and the plot has been overly done. I kept looking for a fresh approach. After a series of financial setbacks and marital disappointments, did Nick murder his beloved Amy? The cops think so, her parents think so. The details are endless and repetitious as the story draws to its inevitable and unexciting conclusion. I kept looking for a twist or two. I know many will enjoy this book because Gillian Flynn is an accomplished writer.
B000G6BM00|5.0|Aliens is probably one of the best movies of<br />the 1980's as well as one of the best movies<br />ever made!<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver gave a great performance<br />as Ellen Ripley, the other cast members<br />gave great, memorable performances as<br />well and the settings, SFX, script,<br />characters, etc are just plain great<br />to watch.<br /><br />Aliens will captivate you, leave you breathless<br />and wanting more after it is done. It is indeed <br />scary to watch at times but also fun and thrilling<br />as well.<br /><br />All in all, a timeless masterpiece, a true classic<br />in not only acting, directing, producing but also<br />filmmaking in general and a great action packed film.
B006LSZECO|3.0|so first thought after finishing it, was 'why is the title Gone Girl?' so I get the obvious reference, but with a short title like that, I think of similar ones like \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" < which is a totally different kind of drama.. I didn't feel like either character would say 'Gone Girl.' What about \\"Just One Olive,\\" lol... or one of their inside jokes... \\"Dancing Monkeys,\\" or \\"Being Amy.\\" Anyways, I thought it was well written, their two voices, but the whole story felt like I might see this on the Lifetime Movie Network, with Dean Cain....no wait Paul Walker as Nick, and....Kate Hudson/ Reese Witherspoon <- they could do cool girl, then crazy lady :) So that sounds more A-List, maybe she'll get a movie deal after all :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this solitaire. I don't mind the ads because its a free app. I love that I can upload images to use as the background and even ones to put on the cards. I also love the winning deal option so I know for sure that there is a way to win that hand, especially after playing several on random and never winning. I think this is the best solitaire free app I have tried so far. I highly recommend!
1439190275|5.0|If you have finally realized that the only way to lose real weight (FAT) is to exercise and give up carbs , this book is for you.  I have all Atkins books but I like this one best as it just tells you want to do etc. Short and to the point.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein was recommended to me by a very good friend and is nothing at all like the books I normally read.  For starters, the narrator of the book is a dog named Enzo and the story is told entirely from his perspective.  It's given me a whole new insight on animals and what they are really thinking and how they feel and the fact that they understand so much more than we give them credit for.<br /><br />The story begins on the eve of Enzo's death.  He's an old dog, you see, and as we all have done and will do, he's reflecting back on his life with his master, Denny, a race car driver and his family.  Enzo's view of the world is very funny and thought provoking.  Enzo shares with us his love of television and watching car races as well as a documentary that people in Mongolia believe when a dog passes from this life, he will be reincarnated as a human.  Enzo is very clear that his ultimate dream is to come back as a man, find Denny and shake his hand.<br /><br />Through Enzo's eyes, we are introduced to Denny's future wife, Eve and meet their daughter Zoe.  With Enzo's help, I learned more about racing cars than I ever did.  Most importantly, we learn from Enzo exactly how loyal a dog is to his pack master and the love he feels for his entire pack.  When Denny faces the ultimate adversity, we see it through Enzo's eyes and feel his helplessness that he can't fix it.  You can't help but love Enzo.  While reading this book, I wished he were with me several times so I could hug him.<br /><br />This book will make you smile, laugh and cry.  This book will make you angry (I absolutely hated the twins and if I had been Enzo, I would have bit them).  For me, only a book that truly speaks to my heart is capable of bringing out so many emotions when I read it and The Art of Racing in the Rain did that and more.  Get this book, but don't just read it...savor it.  Life is short and Enzo showed me how important it is to make every moment count.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|All the hype for this series fell nothing short of flat. The story line was predictable and without substance. It was a book based on sex which  became boring after awhile!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good read.  Alarmingly close to reality as we may know it some day.  Fast paced and well written.  The book was sad but showed the characters resiliency under extreme conditions, and the desire to adapt to a new world.
030758836X|4.0|Award-winning author, Gillian Flynn, has already had tremendous success with her current best-selling novel titled GONE GIRL.  This time around she takes what appears to be a familiar subject --- the break-down and apparently tragic ending of a marriage --- and turns the premise on its ear.<br /><br />On the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy Elliott Dunne goes missing.  The obvious suspect is her husband Nick.  Nick is portrayed as distant and uncaring.  He shows all the ear marks of a spouse who is floundering in his marriage and looking for a way out.  Amy, on the other hand, is portrayed as a creative and lively free spirit who will do anything to rekindle the romantic flames of her faltering relationship with Nick.<br /><br />Or so we thought.<br /><br />What Gillian Flynn does best is toy with the reader's emotions and pushes them deftly into an area of prejudgment when it comes to making their minds up about Nick and Amy.  GONE GIRL is written in a unique style whereby the chapters trade off between Amy and Nick's perspectives.  Amy's part of the narrative starts prior to their marriage and shows a spirited young woman in love.  Nick's portion of the tale begins on the day of Amy's disappearance.  The juxtaposition of these two very differing narratives creates purposeful confusion in the mind of the reader and it is easy to go where Gillian Flynn wants you to.<br /><br />However, GONE GIRL is really two completely different novels.  The first half clearly paints a picture of Nick Dunne as the villain.  His inner monologue refers to several lies he has told everyone around him about Amy's disappearance --- including the police detectives working the case.  You also uncover an affair Nick has been having with a student of his that has been going on for over a year.  Amy loved treasure hunts and would typically leave clues around the house for Nick to actively search for gifts or special events.  As the clues for their fifth anniversary plans are uncovered --- it reveals Nick in an unflattering light as the location of each clue could also be a potentially damaging piece of evidence to convict him of Amy's abduction and/or murder.<br /><br />That is the first half of the novel.  Part two opens up with the revelation that Amy is not only alive but has been playing Nick for months.  She has set up a meticulous scheme to make it look like he was involved in foul play with her disappearance. She knows seemingly all --- Nick's affair, the clues that the police will discover --- and she is always several steps ahead of him.  Could the once romantic and lovable Amy actually be a diabolical sociopath with a dark history of manipulating people like puppets in a Punch and Judy Show (a nice metaphor that is used throughout the novel)?<br /><br />To give away any more particulars would spoil the experience.  Leave it said that GONE GIRL will test your opinions and sensibilities and teach you not to jump to conclusions until you know all the facts.  A brilliant, labyrinthine web of a psychological thriller and sure to be one of the most talked about novels of the year.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader
B0086700CM|5.0|I just picked this up for my Kindle Fire and like it even better than my phone.  Motions and speed are good and no crashes so far.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this, and plot and writing-wise, it pretty much met those mediocre expectations. But Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were surprisingly good together I felt, and their chemistry - both in terms of comedic timing and in the buddy emotion department - got this movie up to 4 stars for me. Between that and the few laugh out loud moments that I got from this, I think it's a solid rental for an escapist Saturday night at home. I should perhaps mention that I actually never watched the TV show, so I had no preconceptions about that going in, which was perhaps a plus.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its the best game ever because its like Mario but beter.I just got it and I fell in love with it.so that's why I love it
1400069289|5.0|I'm barely into this book but enjoying it immensely. It's along the lines of Dale Carnegie's and Malcolm Gladwell's most famous works, but not quite up to par as the research and detail of Gladwell. I'd say it's most similar to Carnegie's style, as the author prefers to illustrate points by telling narratives rather than stringing together research.<br /><br />Overall an easy read with a beautifully designed cover, not at all dense or stuffy in terms of writing style in comparison to other non-fiction books. It's a nice balance of readability and scholarly content, with a bit more emphasis on readability.<br /><br />A personal note: I got this as I entered my advertising career in my twenties, thinking it would be relevant to my field. But I'd say it's relevant for anyone looking to change their lifestyle or habits. It's even relevant for those seeking to understand or avoid addiction. Especially useful for young adults and those interested in how the brain works and understanding the human species.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|Michael Moore got his \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" all wrong. He had some good ideas, but in terms of his sections on the financial institutions he missed most of the causes and the depth of the miserable acts committed. It was far worse than he, and many others thought. And, at the same time, much of it wasn't done in all consciousness, at least for some.  Many people don't aim to drive their neighbors out of their homes on purpose. Much of it was done by executives given a little too much slack in the usual pressure cooker of the workplace, topped off with the usual personal ambition...and laziness. I can say this based on past experiences working at large financial institutions.<br /><br />I enjoyed Capitalism: A Love Story, though I thought the film Inside Job was more focused on the Great Financial Crisis and showed more credibility by relying on interviews with recognized figures. Most recently, the film Four Horsemen took a similar, though perhaps lower budget, approach to Inside Job.<br /><br />A Love Story was first and gets credit here, but in the end it was dramatized and simplistic. It was so simplistic at times it took away from the credibility of the message. Moore spent much time on the disenfranchised middle class factory worker. This was noble or sensationalist, depending on perspective. And the Wal-Mart insurance story regarding the so-called \\"dead peasant policies\\" was truly sad. Yet some of these stories proved distorted when reading the fine print.<br /><br />Conceptually, the \\"jobs moving overseas\\" concept popular with many Americans and politicians is exactly why the middle class factory worker became a dinosaur - although ironically there have been signs of small revivals given the weaker dollar.<br /><br />Corporations, unions and politicians speeded the problem up by making Americans less and less competitive while Americans became the world's consumer of last resort by policy design. Moore somehow assumes that the rest of the world should beunchanged. True, some of China's wages were lower than a \\"true market price.\\" But not all pricing and labor costs from Japan to Thailand and many parts of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, etc were targeted at the US using unfair labor practices.<br /><br />Americans were bred to feed on consumerism by design while the rest of the world got boosts in GDP growth, in some perverted overtime version of the post WWII Marshall Plan gone wild. I went to S Korea at first in the early 1980s. I recall meeting an insurance broker who quoted daily death statistics for shipyard workers. Korea was one big factory targeting catch up to Japan. When I went back in the 90s I was surprised to see how few American products were imported. Koreans were famous for having substitutes for everything, including chewing gum. There was no equality of products. Only protectionism. Which US policy makers did nothing about while the US trade deficit just grew out of control in the unspoken name of promoting economic development growth. Living in Taiwan in the mid-80s I saw pretty much the same thing, though on a lesser scale. The problem started with American policy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with movies like A Love Story many people can be influenced in the wrong - simplistic - direction. I am not singling out A Love Story. There were some other problem accounts and films. The worst job of all perhaps was Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps (2010; $100m production cost?). A Love Story simplified and over-dramatized what it could find, as opposed to trying to capture what it did not understand (ie, the real scope of the lapses of judgment at banker personal levels, the down and dirty dastardly deeds such as how can one value AIG paper at 100 cents on the dollar...), while Money Never Sleeps simply left out the concept of an investment bank altogether! There wasn't even a character that was close to an investment banker in Money Never Sleeps, and investment bankers were and are at the heart of banks.<br /><br />At times also that movies like Boiler Room (2000; $26m production cost?) with Vin Diesel were far better than the big Hollywood productions. Margin Call (2011; $3.5m production cost?) and packed with good actors proved a better story than Money Never Sleeps by far, even if it only represented a slice of events during the financial crisis.<br /><br />At the end of the day the book version of Too Big To Fail (2009) tells the story most clearly (I don't know what to make of the movie. It's worth watching...but it seems to catch only the really key big events). Even the book, which is great on the core of the Lehman-AIG weekends, misses the entire run up to the crisis and how bankers and officials moved into position to create the mess.<br /><br />We need a History of American Capitalism, 1987 - 2007 (or something like that) to be written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app icould play it all day. if you don't like this app then you are crazy. loooooove it
B007V508CC|1.0|Seriously, when I first heard about Overexposed, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, after I bought it and hear it, what I felt it's this, TRASH. It's just like you put foods in a blender(just like the cover)and the only ingesteable stuff  is \\"Payphone\\" after blending? Seriously,  are you meant it? 1 song for $10+? What the...? If you truly want me to describe it, here it is \\"If happy everafter did exist, I would still kept listening the disc. All those fairy tales are full of shit. One more f***ing album I'll be sick. Now I want my refund.\\"<br /><br />Listen to this, M5. Doesn't mean you're M5, you could gave us TRASH like this. Where're you guys?
B004RJMUJO|1.0|this app and where's my water told me I dont own the game and I know I did! I remember buying these apps and now I have to buy them over again so I can play them!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Purchased it for my grandsons and they love playing it. One tries to get to the higher levels before the oter one does.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed and the story kept me riveted to my e reader.  I am looking forward to reading more of Howey's work!
B0035QUXWQ|2.0|The video was not good quality and did not stream well. The connection was not wifi so it should have come through well. I do nothave the same problem with Netflix, but then Netflix doesnt have many instant que options.
B001H9JBW6|4.0|I liked this mini-series. I wandered in looking for more of Benedict Cumberbatch's work after seeing his great performance in \\"Sherlock\\" (which I give 5 stars). This multi-episode story held my attention throughout, and Cumberbatch played well a genius astounded at what was unfolding around him. You can't look away from the screen though because they don't dumb it down for you. One must pay attention. Yes, there are definitely some holes in the fabric the filmmakers weave, as well as some thin spots you could easily rip wide open... but I am going thumbs up on the drama as a whole. I cared about the characters and what their ultimate fate would be.<br /><br />Of far more importance however then the drama itself is the obtuse message delivered by the producers. We are on the verge of losing what remains of our personal liberty. The England painted by the film makers is not some maybe, kind of, far off 'Mad Max' could-be dystopian future. It is more of a 'Max Headroom' world that is looming up all around us. The world of The Last Enemy is just around the corner. In fact, we are at least half way around that corner. Much of the technology used in the film appears to be here already (and micro-biologists ARE dying at an unusually high rate).<br /><br />Many well-intended people in government --such as portrayed in 'The Last Enemy\\"-- think strong controls on the populace is a logical means of preventing terrorism and related crimes. History does not bear that philosophy out however. You can't gain freedom by removing freedom. Given the current state of the evolution of human consciousness, powers given to the Government are at first used with [hopefully] good intent. Then they are mis-used. Then they are ab-used. Every single time. Treatments such as 'The Last Enemy' help point out the futility of 1984 style controls placed on a society. Our best way out of the dilemma the world faces is instead through individual citizens raising their own consciousness. We MUST evolve or freedom [which world history shows to be a temporary state] will die.<br /><br />btw - A title I can think of that might interest those who liked this film is the British political mini-series 'The Amazing Mrs Pritchard'. And those wanting to learn more regarding the themes presented in 'The Last Enemy' have an abundance of choices in video. Two that come to mind are the black dystopian comedy from Terry Gilliam 'Brazil', and the documentary 'Ayn Rand & the Philosophy of Atlas Shrugged'.or freedom [which world history shows to be a temporary state] will die.<br /><br />btw - A title I can think of that might interest those who liked this film is the British political mini-series 'The Amazing Mrs Pritchard'.

B004DM0UII|5.0|I love being able to save a song to the app and go back later and be able to get the title info so I can go purchase the song.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is awesome and like the best game ever in the world and universe you have to help Manny get back to his wife and kids and build a village for animals in the ice age to help him back to his family.
0307477479|5.0|This novel is beautifully and deftly crafted, and indeed deserving of its many accolades. Ms. Egan reaches into a very specific part of us that is desperate and yearning with a keen view. The passage of time and how it changes not just our world but ourselves is a strong and fascinating theme within the book, yet it never felt self-indulgent nor did it swerve into mope-fiction. A brilliant and very smart book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Amazing is all I can say. I was a bit sceptic at first considering the books price and the fact that Anthony Ryan is rather unknown. But was I surprised. This book has all it takes to become a classic. Can't wait for book 2.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|True to its predecessor, this book is a gross disappointment. If we can forgive the ridiculous and implausible plot (do any pornos have a plot, after all?), there can be no forgiveness for the ineptitude of the writer!  Ana is so one dimensional- she can bite her lip and flush- that's the extent of her depth of character. The prose is riddled with grammatical error and is condescending to anyone of intellect. My guess? The target audience wasn't those of us with knowledge of literary merit. The random allusions don't save this text.  I kept hoping this plot and it's shallow characterization would give way to something worthy of its title- the suggestion of multi-faceted complex people with whom we can relate. I'm disappointed, to say the least.  More disappointing is the popularity of this poorly-written, terribly developed, and redundant ( how many times can Ana flush!! Or feel tightening in her belly? ) trilogy. There is absolutely nothing relatable in these characters. Or, maybe there is which serves as reason for its popularity. This disturbs me more than our lowered standard for good literary writing.
B005LF9KMI|4.0|I enjoyed Children of the Corn. It's an original horror movie that packs in tension, thrills and some supernatural aspects. The whole cornfield setting was claustrophobic and interesting. The music was also great. Some decent acting, but also some bad acting. The children did a decent job and got the job done, but some of it was bad. I did enjoy John Franklin's performance as Isaac, though. All of the Outlander shouting was a bit cheesy, on the other hand.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for an authentic, old-school horror film, I recommend Children of the Corn. (the original, not the remake). As of 7/31/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />This film has violence and blood (some of it is done off-screen), no sex or nudity.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Alright,  I gave in and ordered the trilogy for my Kindle. Thought it might spice up my life a little and possibly my marriage. After 36 years together I figured we could use it, after all we are not prudish and have a pretty good time. But from the first book all I did was laugh, sorry, but really if this book is a keeper and page turner not to mention turn on, there is something seriously wrong. Any one remember \\"The Story Of O\\", possibly the first book similar to this one. Really 50 shades ect.. reads like a Harlequin on steroids and not even a particulary good one. Way to much Inner Goddess, once was enough, 500 times was 499 to much. All I can suggest is check out Sophie Oakes or Trista Michaels for a hot read, Emma Holly has some excellent ones too. If you must read this than borrow it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This collection is a high quality product. You get two absolute classic crime films (Godfather: Part 1 & 2) and a decent follow-up (the Godfather: Part 3) in stunning high-definition. The picture and sound quality is top notch as we see breathtaking performances from Al Pacino  and Robert De Niro, and an iconic, memorizing performance from Marlon Brandon as Vito Corleone. As a deep crime saga that is beautifully shot, with amazing music and stunning performances, this collection is worth purchasing.
0143038419|1.0|I had so many people recommend this book to me but I hated it! Gave up on it in India. Just failed to get me interested.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Some games are addictive, but extremely irritating. This game combines a fun world with characters that are entertaining, and a style of gameplay that can last moments or hours. Awesome game!
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|This is the weakest Linkin Park album to date.  Most of the songs are boring and feel uninspired.  It's not good enough to be a 3, but it's not horrible enough to be a 1.  Overall, skip this album.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|Best movie of all time. One of my favourites.<br />This CD is amazing. It also includes 3 previously unreleased songs of Ennio which I'm about to enjoy!<br />And I wanna remark it arrived before the expedited shipping orders... From Germany! I mean: You rock.<br />I wanna thank all the people who made this crucial soundtrack for that very special movie possible.<br />Certainly a wondrous experience. Cheers, man!
B005I6EU7U|1.0|I was super excited for this cover, I thought it was so nice........got it.........kindle fire DOES NOT FIT.  When it came in, even the description of the cover said nothing about it fitting the kindle fire, so why would amazon allow a seller to falsely advertize?  I will be looking into other cases and returning this one.  Hopefully I will find one that is advertized to fit the fire and actually does. Wish me luck!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I bring it to church every Sunday. Its great! and plus its a lot easier to navigate through the Bible like this.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is fantastic. It has a great theme and is easy to play. Dice are all vividly colored and has good instructions in manual. I was supposed to receive this product by the latest Aug 20,2012. I ordered in on July 27th and got it July 30th! Fantastic. Shipping info isn't updated accurately (It said it was shipping soon until I received it today, then it said delivered). Fantastic game for the price!
B003ES61EE|2.0|I am a novice photographer, after a few years of using my P200, I noticed there are some black dots appearing on my images, possibly from the case. Now I bought this item hoping it would remove these black spots and they did not. Unfortunately these system did not help clean the lenses on my point and shoot. Which is why I am giving this review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is like no other book made. The book is the best book I have ever read. I could not even put the book down it was so good. You have to read this book. If I can have my sister read the Hunger Games I can make you read it. The pages will hook you from the start it happend to me it can happen to you. Read The Hunger Games!
B006T3RM08|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.  Now I can sit in bed and use the keyboard and track pad.  I have already ordered another one for my fellow Mac friends.  I understand they even have a left hand version coming soon.  A good friend of mine has the 12-south magic wand and hates it..  :-)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful movie I purchased after watching it at my church. It's a touching movie that will certainly tug on your heart strings. I laughed a lot, I cried, and by the end, I was encouraged even more in my stand as a Christian parent. Great movie for the family! A++++++
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I honestly cannot say anything good about this book. If I were the author I would be embarrassed at such a poorly written, trashy piece of work. Actually, no. I would have chosen a different career path before I ever allowed this crap to be published. The few friends of mine who have actually enjoyed these books (are not in a relationship and are obviously desperate for any kind of sexual release) have said, \\"Oh, it gets better! Just read the other two!\\". I don't think so. It has taken me almost two months to get through this book, as each chapter only proves to be more painful (and not in a sexy kind of way) than the one before. My personal opinion: if you need it that badly, save yourself a few dollars and just go buy a low-budget porno. If not, at least read the reviews before you spend your money because holy cow, my inner goddess is just kicking me for ever stumbling across this book...
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have been relying on Trip Advisor for over 10 years now.  It's a wonderful site for vacation planning, hotel and restaurant reviews and full of information for the traveler.  To have this on Kindle Fire is perfect for me, I have it at my fingertips wherever I go.
B00005LK94|4.0|My favorite movie growing up was Fly Away Home, but I owned a VHS version and wanted to finally update to a DVD. I am very happy with my purchase from this seller. My DVD arrived one day prior to the earliest estimated delivery date; ironically the same day that Amazon sent me a shipping confirmation email- talk about fast! The DVD case shows minor wear, including residue from a price sticker on the front, but other than that the case is in great condition. The DVD has some light cosmetic scratches on it, but doesn't look like they will affect playback. For the price, and the speed of shipment, I would recommend buying again from this seller!
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|This is one of the most well made found footage style films to be released; at the pinacle with films such as The Blair Witch Project. Jump scares often feel cheap and fake, however this film has its fair share with none feeling that way. All the fear derived from the film feels real. A very nice build up of suspense and fear which culminates at the end for one of the best horror movie endings I've witnessed in a very long time brings this movie to my top horror movie list. Solid editing, great directing, and surprisingly well done acting make this a must see film for any horror fan. Truly a well crafted film, and truly frightening.<br />*Side note: Watch the deleted scenes, its helps bring further understanding to the end of the film.
1451648537|3.0|I'm not one to read biographies, in fact this is the first one I ever did. A friend, who is a bit of a mac-fan gave this book to me for birthday, adding that he'd like to discuss it once I'm done, so here I am.<br /><br />As other reviewers noted, the mention of the \\"reality distortion field\\" gets old and tired very fast, and at many points of the book I was wondering if the author realized how much under the influence of the said phenomena he appears to be.<br /><br />The story is mostly structured around the development of Steve Jobs' most famous creations, and the episodes detailing his life are sometimes presented non-chronologically which made it difficult for me to follow. But this was not too distracting. The childhood and adolescence are very briefly covered, probably because the only available witness of those times was Steve Jobs himself, and as with most people only the most bright moments would be remembered.<br /><br />Parts of the story were undeniably inspiring, and gave me a better appreciation of good design.<br /><br />I would not be reading the book again, but I did enjoy it mostly, and learned a few curious things along the way; and I would recommend it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could have given this a minus rating, I would have.  I never would have believed someone could make sex boring, but Christian and Ana achieved that at about orgasm #12.  This book was a total waste of time.  Bad writing, juvenile dialogue, damaged characters that E. L. James doesn't bother trying to arc.  Basically, this is just a bunch of sex scenes strung together with a lot of lip biting and blushing and apologizing.  Don't bother.  I, for one, will not go on to Book 2 or 3.
B007SGM084|1.0|Terrible book.  Terrible writing, terrible characters, terrible plot.  Even the much touted sex scenes are horribly, stupidly written and repetitive.  The fact that so many people are buying and reading this book makes me sad.  I bought the bundle because I usually will press through bad books and read a series just to see how it ends.  Having suffered through the first book, and a chapter of the second, I honestly just don't care anymore.  I wish I could get my money back.
0345803485|1.0|My girlfriend just HAD to jump on the bandwagon so I ordered this for her. As she is working on another book at the time, I thought I might enjoy it first..WOW...BAD...AND NOT A MICHAEL JACKSON KINDA' BAD...IT'S A LAUGHABLY, HORRIBLY BAD KINDA' BAD.<br /><br />First, let me say I'm not reviewing the actual story that unfolds in this book. They didn't have a star rating in the negatives for that. It's not that I don't like erotica, I've read women's erotica and plenty of men's erotic fiction (Penthouse Forum) as a kid. But the storyline itself was a major braincell killer. Any Harlequin Romance novel will seem like \\"War and Peace\\" compared to this. It's very light on making sense. I suppose if you are a horny middle-aged woman this might be a good book for you to light a fire somewhere in your nether regions but keep in mind that first you have to endure some seriously bad writing...that's my real gripe.<br /><br />As an editor for years I don't know how this made it to press. Actually I do. I seem to recall reading that it was written as Moonlight--what the heck is the name of that vampire book series--Twilight--it was written as Twilight fan fiction. Then it was popular enough in that small circle of old-trying-to-be-young freaks so that they changed all the names and were able to publish it in the mass market. I guess word-of-mouth about an S&M love story kept it going. I've never read those Twilight books or seen those movies as they are in the teen genre but the writing here doesn't even seem at the teen level. The scary thing is that the woman who wrote it seems a little too old to be reading those types of books. She seems to have been--at the time of writing--a lonely, 40ish broad who read at a high school level, so then wrote (also at a high school level) some fiction based around books for teens but which meshed with her literary ability. However, being menopausal, she tried to kick up the excitement with some of her hot-flash fantasies.<br /><br />It's just bad. I endured the whole thing over two days just so I could write an honest review (the speed at which I read it should tell you something about how simply it's written---UH OH! Maybe I missed some subtext, LOL). It's like when you pay to go to a bad movie but have to stay until the end rather than walk out just to justify the $12 you spent. You'll find the words on the page painful to decipher unless you're a teen. But if you are a kid you should not be reading some fat old lady's S&M fantasies anyway. If you're over 25 and/or have read any half-decent pulp novel (Stephen King, Brad Thor, Vince Flynn) this will test your comprehension skills just because it's so bad. If you read \\"real\\" literature like any of the classics, or the modern stuff that doesn't make it to the book racks at Walgreen's but instead winds up on the literary awards lists, then this will baffle your brain. Imagine C-Span's Booknotes trying to do a show centered around the gibberish writing on the back of a cereal box and you'll get the absurdity I'm trying to convey. I won't lie, I pitched a few tents, but I honestly think the blood from dying brain cells had flowed down to my groin area. Seriously, there are erotica novels out there that will have you not only aroused, but on the edge of your seat with suspense, and expressing true empathy toward the characters, that is what a good book should do.<br /><br />If you are a serious reader, stay away...torture awaits. If you are a casual female reader, there are many better options for getting yourself hot and bothered--better written and with better sexual encounters. Search Amazon for Women's Erotica (then call me). If you're a casual male reader, rent one of Jenna Jameson's greatest hits. If you haven't read a book since you dropped out of junior high and are home, alone, and horny...YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK!t bad.

B007ZBWJXI|3.0|I have been a fan of Asia since the beginning and I really loved the John Payne Era as well. To tell you the truth there has only been one or two songs in thirty years that I didn't like. There are definately things to enjoy on this album but it is by far IMO the worst one ever done by any incarnation of Asia. I am on my 6th trip through the album and I have to start by saying the lyrics to half the songs are grade school poetry at best. The use of words on a few songs make me cringe. I so hate lyrics where I can guess what the singer is going to say next even before he says it. \\"You had me on the floor, I have to make my way to the door\\". This isn't the main reason why I don't like this album that much. Where is Steve Howe in the mix? I can only hear him on 4 songs or so and usually only for the occasional solo (which aren't up to par either)Alot of this seems so uninspired.<br />Doesn't NO RELIGION sound like 'Don't fear the reaper'?<br />Geoff Downes is his usual brilliant self and Wetton;s vocals still sound sharp but to me this album sounds like a pop rock wannabee and there just aren't enough progressive elements in it for me to shout from the mountain tops about it. If you are an ASIA fan you will no doubt buy this and there are very good songs on it like BURY ME IN WILLOW. It just isn't what I was hoping for after loving OMEGA and PHOENIX so much!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and easy but challenges you as you move through the game.  Great fun while waiting at the airport.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids and I have been on this everyday. its cool how youu can watch the movie trailers and play mini games. scat kung fu is there favorite so far.
0345803485|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!! I have read all 3.  If you get offended easily and don't like reading about bondage, dominancy and submissiveness then this isn't the book for you, however it does have a very good story behind it. Christian Grey  doesn't exist but I want him!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I lovethis game it is so much fun and it is hard to get away from.it is also amid friendly game for little kids if they want to play
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great for people who don't keep track of when their battery is getting low it lets you know when it is &amp; how Long you have left before is runs out of juice &amp; you need to charge it!!!
0345803485|1.0|I'm not sure which upsets me more - that trees had to die for this tripe to be printed, or that this only-the-names-have-changed Twilight fanfic forces me to defend Stephenie Meyer and the truly awful franchise she created.<br /><br />Both make me want to throw myself onto something stabby.<br /><br />Please don't sacrifice your money, time, or brain cells for this. If you're curious about it (as I was, after hearing all the hype), then do yourself a favor and visit the Snark Squad blog. Lorraine does a chapter by chapter recap that will make you bust a gut laughing (and seriously wonder why anyone swoons over this book).
B008E374T0|3.0|I really thought with Handwritten they would explode but the songs are not memorable to me nor are the melodies. I had high hopes maybe too high but this is not a step forward. Brian Fallon said he wants to play Giants Stadium well this CD does not get you there. It seems from the reviews everyone like it but I'll take 59 Sound and American Slang before this. I do like National Anthem and Mulholland Drive and on the deluxe Blue Dahlia. I hope that the next is Brian's Born to Run. Still 3 stars because they are never that bad and better than most music today. I hope they switch producers for there next CD as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|l love this game but I fell like the games cost way too much but over all I love it.

0061726834|5.0|I will admit I reluctantly picked this book up. I read \\"Before I Fall\\" and while I enjoyed the book, it wasn't something I just couldn't put down.  Delirium on the other hand, had me staying up way too late and almost late for work the next morning more than once. I couldn't put it down.  I was rushing off to lunch and breaks so I could get some more reading time.<br /><br />I just finished it and I can't wait to start Pandemonium.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book. A must read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the fact that I can come back hours later, and have made money. It is a very fun game for all ages
B00005N6KG|1.0|I almost skipped this product due to the low price and what I assumed would be poor sound quality. Unfortunately I was fooled by the good reviews and place an order.  The sound quality really is poor. I had the volume on up to full on my ipod and could barely hear the music over the background noise in the gym. What little I could hear was tinny and barely recognizable as music.  This is not an anti-Sony rant - I have gone back to my tried and trusted (but more expensive) Sony MDR-AS20J. They are double the price but 10 times the quality.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good calculator. Could add square and root. Simple to operate with nice big numbers. And it works well... great little calculator. Would recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I did enjoy the plot at first,  although I became frustrated with the stupid female and bored with all the repeat sexual themes. I decided by halfway through the book that I did not want to buy the next two. If your enthralled by the sexual content this book may be for you, however I believe it was overdone.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a fantastic and user friendly app for the budding photographer or the snap happy person alike.  I've been using it to keep my daily photo project going.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I really liked this game, along with other teamlava games (pet, bakery, and fashion especially). It was a entertaining way to pass a boring afternoon if I wasnt reading. I had been playing them for a while and made considerable progress (at or past level 40) and amassed a large amount of neighbors in each game.<br /><br />Earlier today my kindle had an issue and reset itself completely. I was able to get my apps off my cloud and seemed ok. Sometimes in the past if this or the other tl games was lagging or having problems id delete and reinstall it and everything would be just as I left it. So when I had to reinstall everything today I thoought id see the same.<br /><br />Wrong. I found myself back at the beginning in all of them. I realized its because my storm id wasn't logged in.....except there doesn't seem to be a way to log into existing account! I put my name in and got the sorry that name already exists. I know it does, its mine.<br /><br />I see I can create new ID but cant long into one I already have. Can anyone help? I really don't want to have to restart on level one on them all. I worked hard to unlock the stoves, meals, outfits, and pets I had. I would be rather ticked if all that was gone.<br /><br />Anyone have this problem before? I would really appreciate the help.

0345803485|1.0|Sorry--I agree with those (probably regular novel readers) who noticed how badly written this book was. How many times can a girl say, \\"Oh my?\\"<br />I assume since the writer is British she hasn't studied American language and slang because much Brit slang pops up quite often. I doubt many readers notice these things in between the steamy parts (which are on every page). Aside from that, there is the imbalance of power between the characters, and this depicted relationship verges on abuse from a person in power.<br /><br />I also agree with the person who thinks two teenaged girls got together and created these characters (a 25 year old billionaire who never works and is father-like?).<br /><br />Arghhhhh
0307959856|1.0|This was the worst boring book I have ever read.  I loved Pride and Predjudice and thought that this \\"follow-up\\" book would be excellent from reading the jacket cover.  What a total disappointment.  It was a chore to try to read . . . gave up after several chapters as i was bored to tears.  I do not encourage anyone to read this awful book.  Wish there was a zero star rating.
034580404X|5.0|I loved having the box set so that I did not have to wait for each consecutive book to begin. I love this trilogy and am hopeful for a 4th book from the author. Great story!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game to pass the time. Glad it is the original. I would recommend this to others. And it is free... even better.
B0036TGT48|4.0|I have read over so many of the reviews for this film and come away with the feeling that there are many people who take cartoons too seriously.<br /><br />I have always been a huge mythology fan. I was disappointed to see that this version is a far cry from anything true to the actual story of Hercules. In fact, they could have made up any name and made the same movie without referring to Hercules even once. Perhaps that would have worked better for 90% of the people who gave this film negative reviews.  However, they took great liberties with the orginal story and still made something that was entertaining.<br /><br />Was there violence in the film? Yes, Hercules fights several \\"bad guys\\" and chops off heads. It is not done in a gory way but I would not have very little children watch this movie if they are sensitive to such things. Most of the battles are done in a musical montage way with an upbeat song in the background so it is not done in a scary way.<br /><br />I happened to like Meg's jaded character. She had reason to feel the way that she did about men. This may be a concept too vague or confusing for small kids to grasp. It may be that a parent would either not want to allow a small child to view the film or actually explain Meg's feelings...you know like parents should do. One reviewer commented that this film was overly sexualized and demeaning toward women. In one scene, Meg is attempting to get information from Hercules by using her charms. Hercules does not take the bait and instead treats her with a respect that she had not experienced before. It is what encourages her to go against Hades and change her negative opinions. Like so many women in real life, Meg was the one who was making herself out to be an object rather than someone worthy of love, not Hercules and certainly not Disney.<br /><br />A lot of the things that I saw people complain about would be over the heads of small children. After all, how many little ones are well-versed in ancientmythology? If they are, how can you ever feel offended by the violence and sexual themes that you see in this movie if you're reading mythology to your kids? Anything in real mythology is far more violent and sexual than this film. No movie is a babysitter no matter how mundane, harmless, or how big the G rating is on the cover. Be a parent and watch the movie for yourself first. Take note on the areas where your child may have questions or confusion. Watch it with your child and look for those reactions, but don't impose your own reactions if they completely missed that reference that has knotted up your underwear so severely.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I started collecting The Beatles vinal albums in the late 60's and was such a Beatles freak that I played them until the grooves about wore out. I have them all. The covers are worn and we no longer drag out the record player, so when I saw this collection offered by Amazon I just had to have it. I really love having all of their music right there all boxed up in one package. Each CD comes in a paper / cardboard case, takes up much less room than the traditional plastic CD case, which crack and end up tossed anyway. I have noticed a few differences with the albums. The Meet The Beatles is called 'with the beatles', but I figured that may be the UK version of that album. I don't know. I actually have not had the chance to listen to ALL of these CD's but I certainly will and can't wait to do so.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I read some horror stories on the reviews.  But for 70$ I gave it a try.  My particular watch is within seconds over the course of a week.  Pretty good deal.<br /><br />Edit:  Loses 15 seconds / week.
1400052181|5.0|Everyone knows the adage: \\"Never judge a book by its cover.\\"  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an excellent example.<br /><br />Below the title of the book, we read: \\"Doctors took her cells without asking.  Those cells never died.  They launched a medical revolution and a multi-million dollar industry.  More than twenty years later, her children found out.  Their lives would never be the same.\\"<br /><br />Well, there you have it - the story in a nutshell.<br /><br />Not quite.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a multi-layered drama.  It tells the story of Henrietta Lacks and the contribution her cancer cells have made - and are making - to the field of cellular research.  It also invites the reader into the homes of a family trying to come to grips with unresolved grief over the death of a loved one; anger at not fully knowing the cause of her death; hurt in learning that their loved one's tissue samples were taken without her consent; injustice for not being able to share the profits made from the sale of Hela cells; and powerlessness to do anything about it.<br /><br />Beyond that, the book exposes the harsh realities of racial segregation in the U.S. in the 1950s; the complexities of medical science; the ethical and legal questions surrounding informed consent and ownership of tissue; the moral dilemma of understanding the meaning of life in a test tube; the influence of religion and the power of faith to give one peace of mind in the midst of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Perhaps the most powerful aspect of this book, however, is the mirror it holds up for the reader to examine his/her own preconceived notions, values, beliefs and faith.<br /><br />More than once I wanted to close the book and put it away.  It made me angry.  I lived through the 50s, and I don't care to be reminded of this dark chapter in our national history.  And, to be honest, there are aspects about the culture of the black community that often offend me to this day.  Plus,I have a high regard for the medical profession and don't like to think of doctors and researchers playing fast and loose with other people's lives.  The book forced me to own up to my own prejudices.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about this book was its tenacity.  The author persevered through the family's personal rejection and hostility to win their confidence in order to tell their loved one's story, put it into context with the time in which she lived and help them find consolation in knowing the contribution she has made - and is making today - to the world at-large.<br /><br />The book is thoroughly researched and well-written in a crisp and logical journalist style.  The author treats the complex topics of science with the skill of a surgeon, while handling the more delicate issues of interpersonal relations with the tenderness and compassion of a pastor.  The Afterword, especially, is filled with questions for discussion and food for thought.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I loved this book.  I had such a hard time letting go of the characters when I finished it.  I now follow the author on facebook and see that she is in talks for a movie for the book.  Can't wait!
0307592731|5.0|This book was riveting from beginning to end. What a brave soul...Cheryl Strayed took her loss and pain and turned it into a learning experience full of growth and change. She has set a good example for those struggling with adversity and turning it into a positive experience. Best book I've read in a long time!
B002RSDW80|4.0|Original and creative script, running the lives of the two Js in parallel throughout the movie. Besides the mouth watering scenes of food preparation, through Julia we get a glimpse of life in Paris in the 1940s, and of how far McCarthyism went into the private lives of Americans. Throught Julie we see how a young and poor American, with a good idea, can make it. Make it big, in a way that would not be possible in Europe. As a writer I could appreciate the need for Julie to set herself a deadline, without which nothing ever gets completed.<br /><br />It's a fun movie, and an invitation to pursue what you love and not be afraid to put all your energy into it, even if you don't know where it might lead. If your heart is in it, it will lead somewhere. At least in America.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In a nutshell, it's a great book that appeals to teens and adults alike.  My teenager encouraged me to read it so we could discuss the book later.  How could I resist?  The book tells the story of the world of Katniss and Peeta, the unprecendented victors of the 74th Hunger Games as their lives evolve after the games.  While the districts celebrate the Victors, their very survival is perceived as a defiance of the Capital's power.  To crush any potential thoughts of rebellion whithin the districts, the Capital devises a special edition, fit for the 75th Hunger Games.  This edition of the games will keep you on edge, as the players face new rules, new traps and new killing strategies.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i love this app.it is fun. i think it is better than were's my water because you can hear the peoples voices from Phineas and Ferb
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I had to read it to see what all the hype was about.  I'm still wondering! I found the book boring, with no basic story to keep me interested.  As for the \\"eroticism\\" I was expecting, I'm afraid I thought the sex scenes were repetitive and they just left me cold.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible app it is good if you are out a lot. You can read or it will read to you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love it so much its amazing its awesome i want the points for thiz amazing awesome incredible cool game
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application is easy to install and  easy to use.  It presents useful information in a logical manner and seems more accurate in its predictions than other weather applications.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie just lost me, and im not a big sci-fi fan but i just couldnt get into it. If you can watch this movie for free by all means do so. This movie is not worth a $1. I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never happened.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|The DVD came fast, about two days. Perfect condition completely fine. This is a movie i can watch a million times and it still gives me goose bumps. Id recommend it to anyone who enjoys winter sports.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|Very enjoyable read. It made me often laugh aloud. I found the writing very lively and sparkling. I really enjoyed the dialogues,  and sympathize with the characters.<br />Despite that, I found not very believable how Jack publicly betrays Emma's trust. Even more so, it was hardly believable that she forgive him so quickly,  after he gives away all her secrets, humiliating her.  He even refers to her as  \\"a nothing-special girl\\"! IMHO, this impasse would have requested a little more efforts (and pages)  to be solved.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I was satisfied with this movie.  I had seen it previously and am happy to add it to my collection so now I can view it any time.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Comes in very handy when friendly disagreements come about. Nice to settle the \\"whose right\\" quickly so the \\"winner\\" can collect right away!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Solid, dependable information (it's still the weather) to guide by. Loads reliably and finds locations in decent time, never crashed either. Good product, got rid of weather channel for this one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Collins fails to disappoint in her final book in the Hunger Games Trilogy! Great characters, great writing, awesome edge of your seat can't put the book down thrills. Shocking,unexpected events make this the most agonizing book in the series. It is inevitable that you will experience withdrawal when you fnish the series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I typically don't read books but I throughly enjoyed this book. It came as a free sample with my kindle. It did start off kind of slow. Towards the end of chapter 2 til the end of the book it was a complete page turner!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book. Another of the Hunger Games trilogy you just can't put down! Start to finish, edge of your seat thrill! Knowing Collins keen ability to grab the reader's attention, you don't want to wait to buy the third book in the series!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My son really enjoys this game. It's challenging. It could use a little tweaking. He gets a little upset when he trys to direct where an arrow should go and it goes the opposite direction but all in all not bad.
0345803485|1.0|There has been much hype about this book which has shamelessly stolen from '\\"Twilight, \\"Exit to Eden,\\"and movies like \\"Thomas Crown\\"(the glider scene.) It fails to be a quality read.<br /><br />Unrealistic character development does not make one sympathetic or interested in the outcome. The sex scenes are, as others have mentioned, dull, unbelievable and easily skipped.<br /><br />The repetition in language is appropriate for junior high school.
B0010X745K|3.0|Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's \\"The Fog,\\" \\"The Mist\\" is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects.  It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside.  But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.<br /><br />It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.<br /><br />For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proven-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others.  Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in \\"The Birds\\" rolled into one and then writ large.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside.  But its bleak, oh-so-predictable \\"ironic\\" ending makes us pine for the days when \\"The Twilight Zone\\" managed to do this sort of thing on a weekly basis with a whole lot less hyperventilation and fanfare.ilation and fanfare.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is an all time favorite.  Not only is the acting excellent the flashbacks showing news of the era are just great.  I would highly recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a chance to read the first Hunger Games Book by advise from a friend and let me tell you that book was really good so I had to read Catching Fire and so far this one is Great to. I would have to say if you had a chance to read The first Hunger Games Book then you will really like Catching Fire.
B00000269M|5.0|If you love Michael Jackson you know you cannot go wrong with any of his music. I just wished he was still around to make more music.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game rocks!!!!!!At first I got the lite version, it was good but what sucked was that you couldn't save.So I got the full version.I PLAY IT EVERY DAY!!!!totally recommend this game
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Ok acting, EPIC action ! Real SEALS performing combat operations can't be beat ! Only rented this, but after watching twice, definitely go out to buy a copy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is just as good. Out of all three the second book was the best for me, but this one was just as good. I can't wait for her next books from Christians point of view.
1612183956|5.0|This book is consciously an ode to the TV series Twin Peaks, and is also an ode to the TV series \\"The Prisoner\\".<br /><br />THe plot is simple: a dazed, injured Secret Service agent awakes in a small town in Idaho, but nothing is as it seems.  The creepy, strange, and kooky give way to the scary, disturbing, and mysterious.<br /><br />The book is well written.  You want to find out what is happening to the lead character, what the mystery is all about.  The logic is pretty good.. in the sense that the mystery explains the action.  And this is creepy; and would make a good movie, in that the writer gives excellent visual cues.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, even though I do not like the mildly horrific, the scary creepy -- this one is very well done.  The choice made by the lead character at the end makes sense, but leaves the reader wanting more...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better then the first book! Ana puts up with a lot from Christian that I never would,but again it works for them.
B0054JELS4|5.0|This was an excellent purchase. All of the NCIS in the first eight seasons. The disks are of excellent quality. A great price too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If it wasn't for my book club wanting to read this book I never would have, but I'm glad I did. What a really good love story. Yes some of the things Christian did with Anna I would never do, but it worked for them. Good book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is addicting, which makes it fun. only because you want to be able to beat the game. lol
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is fun for when you're bored and don't have anything better to do. My husband and I like to challenge each other on the games to see who can get a better score. I like that some games are harder than others and there is a wide variety.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is really a great app, I've done a lot of pictures and I just got it yesterday. I love all the ways you can change and edit your picture.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Most people with  Kindle fires say This is a bad game . Well why not play on the computer? No matter What device this is played on ,this is the best game yet
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Its a book that I couldn't put down. It reminded me of my senior year and high school days. It was pretty accurate to my memories of high school. It has everything one would want out of a book. I related to the characters so much. I find myself thinking about this book in every day life. Especially when it comes to my relationships with other people. Definitely recommend reading it. One of my top favorite books!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I originally seen chronicle at a special preview. I remember leaving the theater thinking \\"That's the most thought provoking movie I've seen in a long time.\\"  Now that I've watched it in HD at home, it is definitely a different experience.  I still think that everyone should experience this movie however, I will say that there are flaws and good points.  There are times where the movie plays up the change in the main character too much.  It JUST crosses the line of ham.  As far as the other characters, the acting is good, the changes in the director's cut were unnecessary so I would recommend watching the Theatrical version if it's your first time seeing the film.  The hd also messes up the film a bit because you start to see the visual effects too much and it takes you out of the film at pivotal moments.  In the end, I'm happy I purchased this, and would definitely watch this film again. The theatrical version has great pacing and is more emotional than the director's cut.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun, but the game gets harder as you progress through the levels. Somewhat addictive for such an easy game. I find it relaxing.
B004LROMX4|5.0|This DVD was great.  The extras on the DVD provided both interesting and funny content but also filled in some information unknown to this author.  The making section on the aliens also was interesting.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|This was the first time I tried Amazon streaming. Simple, fast, good quality. Way better than google or netflix. Will never use those again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app :) ever since I download it I haven't had any problems with it and its tied for first place as my favorite game with Tiny Village being the other. I'm a HUGE ice age fan so playing the game is really fun for me :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Of course it gets progressively harder. This can be very addicting so beware and make sure you have time. Enjoy yourself!!! (My grade would be 3.5)
B002VJ0576|2.0|I recorded the movie from Satellite and watched it later on.  As a Steampunk movie, I kind of liked it and it gave me some ideas for Steampunk equipment and storylines.  As a Sherlock Holmes movie, it tried, but was marginal.  I think it was the actor who portrayed Holmes, he was nowhere near up to the standards of others who have played Holmes. It is worth watching if you can catch it for free on one of the movie channels or network movies, but I wouldn't pay money for it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is one of those great brain games. I only wish that there was more, but still fun to play.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I recommend this movie and it's books to any parent. It will change the way you view life and upbringing of children.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best read in a long time.  Purchased all three books and couldn't put them down.  Would definitely read E.L. James again.
B007TR1R22|5.0|I just watched it and plan to watch it AGAIN!! this movie is almost \\"riveting!\\" there is SO MUCH to one's thoughts with each scene, but YET so close to someone's reality that they're living right now! TRUE LOVE can be a \\"deep blue sea!\\" What the landlord said was REAL TALK about what TRUE LOVE meant! WOWWWWW!!!! I agree with W. Rodick that the soundtrack is AWESOME and definitely puts you there! It is a GREAT MOVIE! it has LIFE & DEPTH to it! I wasn't born in the 50's, but the director sure made me feel like I was RIGHT THERE! I rented it a few hours ago, but it's a DEFINITE dvd and book purchase!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This was an entertaining an well wrillen book. It kept me on the edge of my seat at times. I coun't wait too see what the next thing that was going to happen happene.
B001M3WPY8|4.0|I have always been a huge fan of this movie since I first saw it on its original release in the 50's. I realize this makes me ancient, but what can I say. The cast is great if you overlook Sterling Hayden's lack of accent and the sword which is so large as to defy a fight as long as the final fight between Robert Wagner and James Mason. These things don't really take away from the movie, which remains one of my favorites.
B00881VLCE|4.0|if you like putting puzzles together then this a game for you.  You can waste many hours putting puzzles together.
0345529057|5.0|My package just arrived this morning it was packed inside a box and then inside double layer foil. I went through the books just to see if there is there any printing errors and I couldn't find any so far. Only thing is that box where are the books has some damage on the corners probably because of the transport. But you should know that the paper isn't the best, it is as I call it WC paper or recycled one, but for this price it is great (books have that smell of a recycled paper that I love). I would highly recommend these books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read books based on the look of the cover (sorry I just do) then reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical...<br />But then again, who can resist the first line \\"a marriage can be a killer...\\"  \\"Gone Girl\\" is simply amazing... is not a romance, it is not a thriller, it is a true mystery of how a spouse can be, and how a spouse makes you (and vice versa). It takes you on a roller coaster, it is an absolute ride.<br /><br />Quick overview... Amy and Nick been married for 5 years... Amy goes missing on their anniversary... All clues point to Nick... What is Nick to do?... Why is she gone?...<br /><br />The book is set in three parts:<br />First part moves on Nick's present and their past in Amy point of view...<br />Second part moves to Amy<br />Third part moves into ....  you just have to read it!
B004SBX112|1.0|why would u pay for this the ads aren't even bad on the free one that's why the free on has 4&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; pointless. I'm very srry if u paid for this it was a mistake
0385474547|5.0|This is a book that a certain reader wont be able to identify with just because of the ideologies in it, and its lack of respect for political correctness. However, if one really just focuses on the work and tries to put themselves in the time frame it was written and the time the author himself grew up (The white people coming to their villages and demanding changes from everything they have ever known) then one would understand why this book has been the classic it has been for several decades. A must read for loves of African fiction, in my opinion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire and it is one of the very best games that i have...and i have bunches!! this game has great graphics ...its wonderful if you need to kill some time...and it does not slow down your KF...AND the very best part of it all...its FREE!!<br />I totally recommend this game...I had 3 Solitaire games downloaded on my KF...but ONLY use this one...its much better than the other 2 free ones that I had.<br />The other thing that I love about this particular Solitaire game is that you can use one of your photos as the back ground..and it also has alot of different options so you can change the entire look of the game...enjoy!!
B007X4N0DU|4.0|Ever since the release of their 1999 album, \\"Fundamental Elements of Southtown\\", POD has become a driving force for Christian-based Rock music to break out into the mainstream. Granted, I never really found their music to be classic material or anything, but I did enjoy such hit songs as \\"Alive\\", \\"Youth of the Nation\\", \\"Boom\\", and \\"Rock the Party\\". After the release of \\"Satellite\\" in 2001, POD decided to modify their sound on their 2003 self-titled album (though it was not really a self-titled album, it was just the band's name not abbreviated). They also changed a lot on \\"Testify\\", and \\"When Angels and Serpents Dance\\". People have been anticipating a true follow-up to \\"Satellite\\" ever since being disappointed with their previous three albums, and the band's latest outing \\"Murdered Love\\" was anticipated to be just that. Truth be told, I don't think it's as good as some of their previous records. Nevertheless, it's still a very fun and enjoyable album.<br /><br />But, what really drove me to write a review for this album was the controversy behind the closer track, \\"I Am\\". When it was announced that the track would be edited (also being removed from the Christian Retail release) because of the song's F-bombs in the chorus, I was interested in purchasing this album. It's kind of odd for someone to buy an album just for profanity, but there is an explanation why I became interested: the song's story is of people whom are not Christian, or people whom have committed iniquitous acts such as murder and sexual harassment, wondering if Jesus is the \\"one and only\\" working force of their lives. The inclusion of the F-bomb, in my opinion, adds a lot or realism to the song, and makes it one of the most powerful and meaningful songs of not only POD's career, but also of Christian music in general. I don't encourage profanity, as I am bothered by it, but when it's used correctly and not for shock value or money (Theory Of A Deadman), I simply have to take notice.<br /><br />Onto the album itself. I don't really feel like this is a complete return to their roots, but like I said, it's a very fun album. Particularly the tracks \\"Eyes\\" featuring Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed, lead single \\"Lost in Forever\\", the feel-good party song \\"West Coast Rock Steady\\", and the sensual but surprisingly positive \\"Bad Boy\\", are the ones that grab me the most other than the closer.

0307346617|3.0|I do love my zombies - \\"true\\" and pseudo. However, despite the fact that I really wanted to like this book, I found it lacking. Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps it was the distracting writing style - government report after government report. I know this style is currently popular and many people enjoy it, but it's not for me. I guess I'll see the movie when it comes out, but seriously? Brad Pitt?! Who casts these things?
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I'm just saying this for people who want it I suggest if you don't want to pay a lot wait till the movie isn't as popular and it should be cheeper

B0055QYKQO|5.0|Let me start off by saying, like my title says, this is an absolutely awesome motherboard! This is also the 1st review I have EVER written for any product so please forgive me if I omit any useful info. (I will be more than happy to answer any questions in due time. I think part of the awesome experience I have had with this motherboard has been the customer tech service I have received from Gigabyte. This is my very 1st build from the ground up I am proud to say and they (Gigabyte) has been there to help me numerous times.<br /><br />My build consists of a [[ASIN:B0055QYKQO GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard]], a [[ASIN:B005UBNKWO AMD FX 6100 6-Core Processor, 3.3 6 Socket AM3+ - FD6100WMGUSBX]], 2 [[ASIN:B0047ZGIUK Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 6850 1GB PCI-E Video Card (100315L)]] running in CrossFireX, [[ASIN:B004E0ZKLQ Corsair Memory Vengeance 16 Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1600 MHz 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9]], and a [[ASIN:B00654PTT2 Creative Sound Blaster Recon3D THX PCIE Fatal1ty Pro Sound Card SB1356]] all running in Windows 7 64-bit.<br /><br />The motherboard is made of high quality materials, well at least compared to my old Vista Gateway's mobo. The revision on the board is 1.1 with the F6 BIOS installed. You will need to install the F8 BIOS. Everything was recognized and installed smoothly. I only had to call Gigabyte to find out why I couldn't switch my RAM from 1333mhz to their native 1600mhz. The tech was able to walk me through the BIOS and change various RAM settings since the profile template for 1600mhz did not work. Again, kudos & much appreciation to the Gigabyte customer support.<br /><br />And finally, this thing overclocks like a champ. I was able to push (with stability mind you) my CPU up to 5 GHz! I have decided to leave it at 4.2 GHz as this is fast enough for me. Everything is kept nice and cool (under 50c under load) with the [[ASIN:B002G1YPH0 Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler, RR-B10-212P-G1]] handling my CPU, and the other four fans inside my [[ASIN:B004351H9G NZXT Guardian Black SECC Steel Chassis ATX Mid Tower Case 921RB-BL]] handle the rest.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy seeing all the new and interesting animals, decorations and fun stuff I can get in my own Ice Age world. A couple of glitches with friends map, quests that won't allow me to finish... fix those and this game would be higher. Otherwise, it is fun and relaxing.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is my favorite album to come out in years. There is not a single track I don't listen to , usually with the volume on 11. The only thing better than Mumford and Sons recorded is them live. I highly recommend both to anyone with a pulse.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|The Alien anthology is well put together and the movie transfers onto blu ray are great--most notably \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\".  Also, each movie has a 2003 directors cut version of the film which is usually much better than watching the theatrical cut since you get more story.  Not sure if this set is worth $70 - $100, but anything under that, it's a decent buy.  I got it for $28, so I'm more than happy with my purchase.  This is one time I feel glad I've been \\"alienated\\".
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as book one or two.  I couldn't even finish it.  I'm not going to rip on the author's writing style , but it was too monotonous after book one and two.  She could have combined all three books and wrote a long book all in one.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Through a combination of factors, most important of which is a stellar discography, Testament has become a revered, beloved band within metal circles.  They've been through every phase a band can go through and emerged as thrash legends.  It would be so easy at this stage of their career to give them a pass and say, 'Wow, great album, I'm just glad they're still around.'<br /><br />That won't be necessary with Dark Roots of Earth.  It's an example  of world-class musicians digging deep late in the game, finding the inspiration to put together a magnificent album.  It's not too far removed from The Formation of Damnation as far as style goes, but the songwriting and musicianship have been stepped up a notch.  With the aid of Andy Sneap, Testament have put together what should end up being the best metal album of 2012.<br /><br />Compared to Formation, the songs on Dark Roots sound more potent, polished, and inspired, and they make more use of dynamics to achieve an epic quality.  Alex Skolnick has far more presence this time around, upping the level of technicality as well as melody.  It has a certain precision that Formation was lacking, but it still feels loose and organic as he and Eric Peterson deal out some of the most infectious Testament riffs in years.<br /><br />Behind those riffs, Gene Hoglan brings a ferocity to the drums that only he can.  He shows that he can do much more than just pure speed, providing a driving swing to the mid-paced and groove-styled tunes.  He even tries his hand at standard hard rock on the power ballad Cold Embrace.  And when the tempo does pick up, there's not a better metal drummer alive than Hoglan.  No doubt he puts his unique stamp on the album.<br /><br />Finally, Chuck Billy sounds incredible.  You can't hear any signs of age in his voice, which sounds no different to me than it did in the 80's and 90's.  Along with his raspy thrash style and death metal vocals, it's great to hear him get back to some clean singing.  Throughout the album, he drops hooks left and right that you can't help singing along to after only a couple listens.  Whether it was Sneap, advancing age, or stiff competition, something lit a fire under Testament going into Dark Roots.  Fortunately for us, we get to reap the benefits.  Now, some notes on each track for anyone wanting more specifics.<br /><br />Rise Up--This up-tempo song opens the album with attitude.  The verses and chorus build up with gradually increasing speed, and the solos smoke.  You can also tell right off that Chuck is on his game, mixing up his vocals with a good combination of singing and growling.<br /><br />Native Blood--The vocal hooks start sinking in as Chuck seems inspired.  The song features an awesome melodic chorus that uses blast beats to beautifully contrast with the music.<br /><br />Dark Roots of Earth--The title track starts kind of slow and bluesy, almost like a Souls of Black song, then starts to stomp.  It has one of my favorite Testament choruses in a long time.<br /><br />True American Hate--This is a blistering thrash number where Hoglan shows off.  It's a good example of the album's dynamics.  The chorus starts kind of average, seems almost predictable, and then kicks into overdrive.  Touches like that make an album memorable.  They could've been lazy and played it straight and it would've sounded fine, but these songs were obviously worked on and thought about for a long period of time.<br /><br />A Day in the Death--This one has a nice bass solo to open, giving it a loose feel like a band jamming.  The verses are mid-paced with semi-technical riffs and more vocal hooks sure to have you singing the song to yourself after two or three listens.<br /><br />Cold Embrace--Testament writes a ballad for the first time since Low.  It's good to hear this side of Chuck's voice again.  The heavy parts early on can't help but remind me of Fade to Black, but not in a rip-off way.  There's a lot going on in this song with plenty of heavy guitars.<br /><br />Man Kills Mankind--Mid-paced thrash with infectious hooks, blazing solos, and strong riffs.  Chuck shows off perfect thrash metal vocals, gruff and strong, but with some voice and melody to keep it memorable.<br /><br />Throne of Thorns--This song has the bounce of Low-era Testament with a unique and heavy chorus, and again, great vocals.<br /><br />Last Stand for Independence--Starts with sweet thrash shredding, then goes mid-paced; has some mid-80's thrash sounding guitar parts a couple minutes in and toward the end.  This track is an intense closer for a superb release by Testament.  Metal fans will be hearing a lot of good things in the coming weeks about Dark Roots of Earth.vy guitars.<br /><br />Man Kills Mankind--Mid-paced thrash with infectious hooks, blazing solos, and strong riffs.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I especially enjoyed the almost total lack of vocals on this album . It is quite a bit different than the last few releases. Having listened to Carlos since the 60's , I was quite pleased to hear him again. I suggest that you pay your 9.99, listen to it more than once and appreciate it for what it is, a great performance by a great guitarist.

B001H1SW4M|4.0|Didn't watch the whole movie the first time, figured I'd seen 10,000 of these in the past... but a friend convinced me to watch it all the way through.  It's a complete role-reversal on the horror genre.  Great movie.  Lots of fun.  Very deserving of a franchise.  Becasue of the SAW poster (the colors and style), I recently picked up this micro-budget horror movie that actually is pretty decent considering:  ROADSIDE MASSACRE.  It's sort of my new \\"gem\\"--and just like SAW, I thought Roadside sucked at first until I started really thinking about it after watching it... Really plays games on your head.  (SAW IV is about when this series started to drop though).[[ASIN:B008I744XQ Roadside Massacre]]
0060555661|5.0|This was a great book.  Sometimes you get caught up in the hype that is presented in day-to-day media and lose sight of what is important when investing. After reading this book I changed the course of my investing from a \\"trader\\" mentality to an \\"investor\\" mentality. The best part now is that I spend about 1/4 as much time now on investments than I used to... I sleep better too!

0062197258|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author, I almost didn't choose it but I am so glad I did.  While I read all sorts of genres, I always come back to thrillers.  This is one of those stories that is personal feeling, it's very easy to put yourself in the mind of the main character Catherine/Cathy.<br /><br />Catherine is a young woman living in northern England.  She has a group of friends to whom she is close and they spend a lot of time going out to pubs and partying.  She lives a carefree, single lifestyle, drinking a little too much and often times waking up finding herself next to a man she doesn't know.<br /><br />Until she meets Lee.  Suddenly, she is swept off of her feet by his startling good looks, take charge personality.  Her friends are smitten and a bit jealous.  But then, things begin to change and that's where it starts getting scary.<br /><br />This book is told in first person and goes back and forth to the current life of Cathy and the former life of Catherine.  Cathy is Catherine 3 years later.  Cathy is nearly paralyzed by severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, spending hours every day checking her windows, doors and apartment for signs of tampering, wandering in long, circuitous routes home each day so she can't be followed, suffering from long bouts of insomnia.  She is no longer the Catherine of the past because something horrible happened to her....and to Lee, who is never far from her mind, to change her life forever.<br /><br />This book was so scary, it reminded me of an old Alfred Hitchcock movie or something where the terror isn't blatant and spelled out, it sort of just creeps up on you as you begin to realize what's going on, why \\"Catherine\\" is now \\"Cathy\\".  You can feel the loneliness, despair and mounting terror as the story goes on.  Cathy is a likable character, someone who at first appears weak but quickly begins to show her strength.  This book is set in a town called Lancaster, in the northern part of England and in London.  The author is obviously British, but she doesn't use a lot of British-English styles that make the book seem foreign.  I loved her writing style, the way she was able to build suspense and keep me interested and kept me guessing until the last sentence of the book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dark thriller, you'll love this.  I can completely see this made into a movie that would have you watching with your hand over your eyes..

034580404X|1.0|I read the first chapter of Fifty Shades prior to purchasing this trilogy.  The first chapter that Amazon offered on the book was far from being sufficient to know what the trilogy was actually about.  (One chapter...no sick sex)  Little did I know that I was purchasing the most explecit set of violent sex books on the market. It seemed as though the actual publicity came out on the book after I purchased it. I'm not a person that finds it necessary to read something like this to get turned on.  I felt these books had the reverse reaction on me.  I didn't want to be touched at all after reading this. The story behind Christopher's personality was interesting and I would have enjoyed it much more if it would have not included all of the trash. I felt sorry for Christian but I felt more sorry for Ana.  A good author could have told this story without the \\"extras\\".  Would I recommend this book to someone else.....NO WAY! And, to be honest, I will never pick up a book written by E.L. James again.  I feel sorry for Ms. James that she feels she has to write this way to sell a book.  Sorry Ms. James...you and your book are trash!

B006XF5BTG|4.0|The book was reasonably priced and seemed to give good sound advice for weightlifting.  The first half of the book was, as so many self-help books are, an advertisement for itself.  I liked the way he steers the reader away from spending lots of money on supplements etc. He does not understand the \\"placebo effect\\". He doesn't understand there is a lot more to diet than drinking protein powder in water.  Maybe he does and just avoided the whole issue, but since so much of the book is dedicated to telling you how important diet is, there could have been tons of recipes and ideas for providing yourself meals.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My wife and I took our three year and six year old daughters to see this in 3-D.  The kids were riveted the entire time, and required no potty breaks!  For the little ones, it's bright and colorful and has great music and action that will keep their attention focused.  Our girls are still singing \\"Let it Grow\\" after seeing the movie several months ago.<br /><br />From the perspective of a parent, the movie has a great message!  The Lorax's story is very relevant and teaches a great lesson on conservation and protecting our environment.  There is also a message on behavior changes and how making changes will have a positive impact on our world.  And the music is amazing!  I got all choked up during the \\"Let it Grow\\" scene because the music was just that stirring, when coupled with the content of the scenes.  The movie is a lot of fun too, with cute characters and witty dialogue, especially between the Lorax and the Once-ler.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Yes, it is a GORGEOUS album, and yes I also found the finger-nail-tapping annoying, but overall this is a GREAT relaxing, light some candles, set the mood kind of album.  As much as I LOVE LOVE LOVE her previous album, I'm glad she didn't just rehash it.  Having said that, I do look forward to her doing a part II of \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" album in the future.<br /><br />One last thing, the album cover of \\"The Absence\\" perfectly sets the tone of the album for me... the colors, the sensual pose, and even though the sunglasses are iconic on her, I'm glad to see her without them (as it answers an intimate question I was curious about: does she leave them on while in the throws of passion? And I mean that in a respectful way :)<br /><br />LA mitchell

B0025KVLTC|5.0|popular music took a huge turning point in 1966, bands like the beatles , byrds and beach boys were pioneering a new more advanced type of rock and pop and early protometal was around with bands like the yardbirds and others. the old single based album was going away and this one helped lead that trend. as did the beach boys pet sounds which is just as great as this one.  I love the older beatles music but on this one they were takin giant leaps forward.  There isn't a filler track on this one and each member shines and is at their peak here.

I saw something on Pinterest where you secretly get your child's teachers throughout the years to write something in this book at the end of the school year and then give it to the child when they graduate!  I'm very excited to do this and was very pleased with the speed of delivery and quality of the books!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is one of those special books that touches the heart.  A child with a severely deformed face enters the fifth grade among other \\"normal\\" children.  The book details his feelings, his sister's feelings, his friend's feelings, etc.  It is a lesson for all of us that the appearance of the face, lovely or otherwise, can camouflage the beauty or the ugliness of our spirits.  Delightful book!  I didn't want it to end!!
B0063TKLU6|5.0|The scorpions are a truly great band. they create incredible melodic hard rock that is well written and always well sung. they started out doing psych rock and ended up being one of the worlds most popular rock bands. they are still making great music too. On this one which is all region and needs a 3d tv to really apprieciate this blu ray, really is a excellent show. And in 3d it looks even better than a normal concert video. It was shot in 3d by professionals too. The big hits from the 1979-90's era on this one too. With a few other songs. Sadly there are no earlier songs from the 1972-78 era on here. Those songs sound alot different than the later efforts but they are still great.

034580404X|3.0|I have so far read book 1 & now starting book 2, so I will have to update after I finish book 2 & 3! For some reason I had expected these to be so much better. Maybe it is because I have read hundreds of book in almost every genre & I have pretty much heard it all & nothing so far is surprising or nothing I haven't read/heard of before.The books seem like they were written by a 16yr old with a overly active imagination about her wild, dominating, erotic, fantasy man.. Ana who is 22, says Holy F***, Holy Cow, Holy S*** & Jeez a million times & thats in the 1st book alone & we have to hear 1000 times how hot/beautiful he is on almost every other page & her chewing her lower lip another 1000 times. She just comes across a plain silly & immature. And, I am so sick of her \\"Inner Goddess\\" constantly talking, not sure if the author was trying to add comedy to this book or what adding all the inner goddess silly dialogue. Right off the bat, I didn't like the fact that Christian was only 26 ;/ seems a bit young since he is supposed to be a worldly experienced billionaire & would be a bit more believable is he was old, but then again at times he acts like a spoiled immature boy. Ana acts most of the time like a silly 16yr old, & is of course a v***** in every way, never been kissed,nor had a \\"O\\", BUT she can spontaneously have them on command constantly (he just tells her too & bam she is flying into the next universe), multiple earth shattering into a million pieces repeatedly, she can practically have them from just looking at the man or rather she is convulsing a lot on the verge. Looking forward to books 2 & 3 because I really what to find out his story & why he is the way he is, all I have to say is I HOPE is has some sort of sensible \\"Happy Ending\\"!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is great for trying to fall asleep when people are snoring you can mix and match up to 10 sounds!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game very addictive also I highly recommend this game any age group any ways the point is is that I a<br />AWESOME game
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Totally loved this sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Book 2 in the Millenium Trilogy).  One of my favourites, rates 10 out of 10 for me!
034580404X|4.0|A series you can't put down!! Very thought provoking. But a bit twisted until limits are set. Writing isn't the best but the subject doesn't let you stop reading.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I injoy the battery HD which is free and thus injoy even more.  But yeah it is very useful in telling you in detail how much battery life U have left and even figures how long U can do things such as surf web, watch videos, &amp; so on &amp; so forth so yeah if U have a default battery indicator give it a shot it costs nothing &amp; is better than most standard.
B007R3B5WU|5.0|If you know anything about classic jazz then this line up of musicians should say it all.this is an absolute all-star line up like no other.My only wish for music of this time is a quality recording which more often than not  doesnt happen often enough for the worlds highest art form. GREAT STUFF!!!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love it! I'm actually organized now(: I think they fixed the update problem, because I haven't had any troubles with that(:
B0084A9CA2|3.0|Great story.  The words and concepts make you think and reflect upon your own life subconsciencously.<br /><br />There were a lot of incorrect words and bad grammar.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoyed Game of Thrones so much. It was difficult for the first 50 pages or so to get into the language all of the characters. My advice: go to the very back of the book as reference where they have all of the kingdoms listed with all of the relationships of the characters. It will definitely put it in order for you! Then, ENJOY!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There are about 40 sounds in this version and I love almost all of them, this is a great app to help me relieve stress and to sleep. I will probably upgrade to the full version with over 80 sounds for 3$. Its amazing that this app is free!!!! I would reccomend to any person that sleeps or has occasional stress. Works great on my Kindle.
B00884GR0W|4.0|I like this game, but it should be easier to turn and protect yourself from creatures. I spawn in an ocean and always end up with a great white killing me, and when I reach land, there are bears that kill me.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|really good app lets me know when my batter low or when my bstters high great app defentlly recaminded workes great.. at first u just have to play around with it:)
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoy this game..however the different levels have the same \\"puzzle games\\"..different places. I do wish I could enlarge the pictures..but for .99¢ it passes time....there is one other thought, if you touch the screen to many times,even if it is by accident..they will take 20seconds away from your time..I paid for this game..it should allow me to look whereever I would like...
0143038419|4.0|I like this book. And I've found a lot of new for myself. I agree that book has a lot of controversial moments but it doesn't make it poor, it force people to discuss about. In a crossing or the drop's history by Anatoliy Obraztsov You can see almost the same situation. But I should recommend to read both. Because you can get more knowledges and information
B008MEM24S|5.0|Its ano excellent game an hours of entertainment even my 3 year old loves it.  Ive had a lot of fun.cool plesant ly fun
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A lot of fun! I would recommend for everyone to play this game! Its not like the Oregon trail you played in school though!
030758836X|4.0|I'm a middle school teacher and have the summer to really focus on reading. Few books have been touted quite as universally as \\"Gone Girl,\\" and with good reason. While I can't give it a 5-star review, I would say that it's closer to 5 than 4. A 4.5, if you will. While I hope this isn't a spoiler (it isn't because I'm not giving away details about the ending or significant plot twists) it took me about 150 pages before I truly started to become engaged in this book. The back-and-forth first person narratives of Nick and Amy are easy to track since Flynn gives them distinct voices that share only SOME overlapping perspectives on events they present in the novel. What I like best about this story is the continued question of the reliable narrator. Who do you trust? Do you trust Nick and his presentation (or performance) of himself or do you trust the intimate voice of his missing wife's in her diary, all with entries leading up to the day of her disappearance? What begins as a mystery eventually morphs into a psychological study of personality, identity, and responsibility in a society in which negativity is glorified, innocence is either contrived or exploited, and relationships are developed under the pretense of what one person perceives what the other wants. The ending will have you questioning yourself and why you make the decisions that you do, how you present yourself to others and if that's an accurate presentation, why we fall in love and who we fall in love with, and how do you know that you can really trust someone, sometimes, above all, yourself?<br /><br />I'm now interested in reading \\"Dark Places\\" and \\"Sharp Objects.\\"
1451608659|5.0|The story is mind boggling - we all watched this amazing youngster perform as a gymnastic superstar but to now read the behind the scenes look at her life is heartbreaking.<br /><br />She has come through as a survivor and now gives a warning to us that everything is not exactly as it seems.<br /><br />I could not put this book down.  Moceanu is to be admired for telling her truth.<br /><br />EVERY PARENT OF A CHILD INVOLVED WITH GYMNASTICS SHOULD READ THIS!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the battery app.was really useful. there were many a time that I would have lost my data if it weren't for this app.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|You gotta love Fiona apple! She's still uncomfortably honest, unapologetically confessional, continually in crisis and producing albums with the title length of a William Blake poem. She'll never change and thank goodness for that, because most importantly she's still able to make brilliant music out of all this neuroses. The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do is her stellar fourth studio album, that now easily secures her a place along side PJ Harvey, Cat Power and Bjork as one of the greatest female singer songwriters of the last twenty years. There's always been an undercurrent of darkness to Fiona's music in the past, but her enraged vocals and bleak minor chords are no longer in the periphery here, instead they're obtrusively planted right at the centre.<br /><br />\\"Every single night\\" Whimsically guttural singing and playfully angst ridden lyrics shouldn't be too unfamiliar to Fiona Apple diehards but they may be a little suprised to find the sweet melodious instrumentation that normally accompanies them absent. A sparsely played piano, minimal glockenspiel and an aggresive vocal harmony is about all you'll hear for the entirity of this song and as an opener it isn't a red herring for the rest of the album either. Most of these songs have a pared down dissonant quality to them and don't really lend themselves to being featured on commercial radio stations unlike her previous output (Extraordinary Machine especially). The ecclecticism that Fiona's quite renowned for is still to be found on this album though, it's just a little difficult to spot at first, with the angry singing and morose piano chords seemingly dominating every song.<br /><br />Check the jazzy drum solo that introduces \\"Left Alone\\" or the all out tribal ecstasy of \\"Hot Knife\\". And the way in which Fiona crafts these little moments normally during the bridge in these dark songs where she'll sing a lovely falsetto or actually play a major chord. Granted this is her most difficult album by far, but one could also argue it's her most rewarding in many ways to, with all Fiona's gloomy anguish on here translating into some powerfully breathtaking moments. Like \\"Regret\\" and \\"Valentine\\" that conjure some of the most devastating melancholy since early Red House painters. The pitter patter of \\"Daredevil\\" with it's single note piano is a particular delight for me also and it features the wonderfully ambiguous line \\"Don't let me ruin me, I may need a chaperone\\" it's often difficult to tell whether Fiona's being ironical or bluntly honest about her own self-destructiveness at the best of times, but this line seems to crytallize her playfulness.<br /><br />\\"Anything we want\\" is another obvious highlight, with it's seductive chorus of nefarious piano chords likely to make you feel worryingly intoxicated after hearing them. Though some new to Fiona Apple may find her different vocal inflections irritatingly pretentious on The Idler Wheel you'll soon find them to be authentic manifestations of her various states of mind. Admitedly it can sound a little like nails on a chalk board when her growling and groaning attempt to reach Kurt Cobain-like proportions, but you have to admire her unrelenting spirit. Fiona's nothing if not self aware to. with lines like \\"Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key\\" accurately predicting some of the negative responses to her new uncomprising approach. Personally i do miss some of the colourful production Jon Brion brought to her previous albums, but i can appreciate the stark angry Fiona almost as much here and would still rank this album alongside those as another intriuging chapter in miss Apple's impressive discography.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read this year.  I am truly impressed with the Hugh's ability to capture a moment and make you feel like you are the one going through the silo.  I was worried that the series of short stories would become less engaging as the books went on, but these are captivating from start to end. Great writing Mr. Howey, you have arrived.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Really great game, its not Minecraft and its not meant to be, there were games like this before Minecraft. Its a good game and you should be judging it on its own merits not comparing it to another game. If you compare it to Minecraft PE it absolutely blows it out of the water. Its got a huge mob variety, nice graphics as well as fully functioning quests and vehicles and a way of trading. Well worth the money, tell your friends... I certainly will!
B0086700CM|4.0|the. game is great but it is super laggy and it sticks from time to time.. make it faster please

0307716546|5.0|i am a huge fan of Rosamund Lupton after reading the suspense-filled Sister last year. As with Sister, I also devoured Afterwards in a single sitting, staying up way past my bedtime with tears pouring down my face. In both instances, I was satisfied with the ending. That said, MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT: I did wish there was a little more exposition about Rowena and her motives. Rowena drew such a compelling picture of WHY Maisie did what she did so we could really see her as the arsonist, but when Jenny enlightens us that it was really Rowena, we never really understand her motives, especially when we learn that she never had an abusive dad. Why would she do such a thing? Just one scene with Maisie or Donald giving background color on why and when Rowena went rotten would have made this a perfect book. But, it is still excellent and I would buy another Rosamund book in a heartbeat. I do hope in the future she will lay off these gimmicky premises-she is such a beautiful writer and I really think it's her suspenseful pacing and her remarkable ability to draw realistic relationships that keep her readers hooked, no time travel or supernatural stuff needed.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this ap seems to work better than the weather channel ap for me. it gives acurate readings and doesnt cause my kindle to freeze
0312641893|5.0|MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS:<br /><br />Cinder is a great Cinderella tale, full of adventure and an unlikely heroine. In other adaptations of this fairy tale, I'm always bugged by Cinderella waiting for a Fairy godmother to come and fix everything for her.  If we all waited for something \\"magical\\" to happen to change our current situations, then we would have to wait a long time. So the reason I fell in love with the story Cinder was that while she lived in tough circumstances, she rolled with the punches, was interesting and kind, and she kept trying to think of ways to leave on her own accord and not wait for her \\"fairy godmother.\\"<br /><br />Also, unlike other Cinderella tales, the main character isn't just having a pity party while all she has to do is pick up her things and leave.  Cinder actually has a good reason why she's stuck in the awful situation that she is in. Since she is a cyborg (with no rights) in a futuristic society, and her stepmother owns her, Cinder could get arrested anywhere on the planet if she were to leave home.  Also, any money that she makes in her mechanic shop must go to her Stepmom.  Thus, Cinder has to think strategically before she leaves, which is what she is trying to do throughout the story.  I appreciate a heroine who works hard to make things happen, rather than wait around and have things happen to her (cough* Bella in Twilight).<br /><br />Another thing that bugs me about the original fairy tale is that Cinderella gets all gussied up for the ball, the prince falls in love with her, the clock strikes midnight, and she runs away. After that, when she's back in her maid clothes, the prince doesn't even recognize her. Once the prince puts the glass slipper on, only then does he realize that she was the girl he danced all night with. Um, that's true love?  That's what little girls have to look forward to?  At least in Cinder, the prince recognizes Cinder's mechanical skills, and likes her for who she is first.  AFTER getting to know her, he pretty much has to force her to come to the ball.  And finally, when the main character shows up at the ball, she doesn't try to change into anybody else.  The prince recognizes her from the get-go.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder is a fantastic story, with some interesting twists and turns.  And although this story has been done many times, this is a fresh and fun take on the classic tale.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone wanting a fairytale with a strong heroine and a good plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app!! I have not been off of it sence I got it!!!!! I would recommend this app!!!!
0439023521|5.0|In the Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, surviving is the only way to win the game.<br /><br />  Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl, lives in District 12 of Panem, a country that used to be known as the United States. Once a year, each of the thirteen districts of Panem must provide two tributes, a boy and a girl, to fight to death in an arena, for the entertainment of the Capitol. To her horror, Katniss's little sister Primrose Everdeen, only twelve, is picked in the reaping. Katniss, who loves her sister more than anything in the world, volunteers to take her place. Facing death, Katniss plans to use her survival skills and remain the last one standing...that is, until Peeta Mellark's name is called.<br /><br />  Katniss Everdeen inspired those around her by keeping to her beliefs. She does not allow others to overlook her, and works at showing them that she is \\"more than a piece in their games.\\" I admire Katniss because she is confident throughout the whole book and isn't afraid to be herself. I recommend this book to people 12 and up.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I updated the game and it deleted ALL of my progress! This Angry Birds is the hardest and the most expensive and it takes away all your progress with the update. Disappointed that it took me back to 0 on all levels.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Simple, I love this Zoom for the kinect.<br />I read all kind of reviews here in amazon, really good ones and really bad goes, I still got it because Amazon would let me return it if It would not work. I follow the simple installation instructions, and the Zoom works GREAT. My leaving room is really small, and this would be my only option to play with the Kinect at home, I have had no problems at all so far. Happy this zoom exists.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much. When I'm bored and all other games start to suck, or when all my Words, Hanging, Scramble, and DrawSomething games are all caught up, TempleRun is my savior.

B00008WT5C|5.0|Another AC/DC album that is fantastic. One of their rawest if not, THE rawest cd they've ever made. Now here are the songs.<br /><br />Go Down 4/5 - A great, typical dirty AC/DC song. It's about well \\"given the dog a bone\\".<br /><br />Dog Eat Dog 5/5 - I love the riff and solo to this song, just great.<br /><br />Let There Be Rock 5/5 - One of their most popular songs, a great, long, solo filled song that is sure to pump you up!<br /><br />Bad Boy Boogie 4/5 - Another great song, the riff is awesome.<br /><br />Problem Child 5/5 - Great even though it's also on \\"Dirty Deeds\\". The reason for this is because they made a song called \\"Crabsody in Blue\\" about the crabs disease. Producers said it was too dirty so they just stuck Problem Child in it's place. It is available on Backtracks though.<br /><br />Overdose 4/5 - Great intro, nice riff. Another sex song.<br /><br />Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be 5/5 - My favorite song on here. I just love that riff. Another sex song.<br /><br />Whole Lotta Rosie 4/5 - Another popular AC/DC song, nice riff and is based on a true story about<br />Bon Scott sleeping with a very fat woman named Rosie.<br /><br />A great album all together. Buy it!

0375842209|2.0|Well, maybe not THAT bad, but..<br /> 1. I have a huge problem with those bestsellers. More often than not they are disappointing and overrated.<br /> 2. My biggest concern with this book is my strong suspicion that the author chose the main theme of World War II only as a decoration for his own  fictional story. The Book Thief is lacking practically everything that is needed to create that gloomy atmosphere of Nazi Germany. Especially, there is very little realism in the background of the events. The main characters live their life, carrying about their own problems as though the war outside is something irrelevant. I wanted to hear at least one strong opinion from any of the adults regarding the war and killings and disagreeing with the Leader.. It just wasn't there. The author kept skipping year after year of such a horrible time , and there was this promise of \\" bad things to come\\", but still, nothing was happening. And you ask yourself, why did he chose that era? the same plot would work well for any other century, because there is always a war somewhere and we live without caring much about those who get killed. Until they are not our close friends or relatives. So, is it possible to imagine such a calmness of people, when their country is fighting it's the most bloodiest war ever? How come, that there is no conversations at the kitchen table about any side affects of bad economy, hungry neighbors next door, father/ son conflict? If there was some possible safety bubble for the little girl -maybe, the mayor's house. But not the  basement with a hidden Jewish boy in there. I would expect at least one or two GESTAPO raids here in there, so the reader could really appreciate and understand the effort and risk of the German family. Instead, they read , dream their nightmares and steal some more books with a supposedly meaningful titles .<br />3. Max. Completely boring character. Especially for young readers. How could he, being such a rebel  and a fist fighter in the past, sit there all the time locked in his mind ? If the Author intended to show a broken human spirit..he failed. There wasn't enough information provided that Max's trauma would seem so unbearable. Or was this whole \\"hidden Jew in my basement\\" a weak attempt to say that there were some good German people? We know about them from other books, don't we? But in The Book Thief even helping an enemy is presented to us more like personal promise, than a brave gesture. \\"Promise is a promise\\". And if there was no personal attachment to Max, would Hans or Liesle even go to see the walking Jewish crowd? I don't think so. Again, it's not that I don't believe in their kindness... I just don't see them as brave and involved in suffering of others. And, by the way, how did Max get caught?<br />4. The Book Thief herself. We don't know much about her. Besides the fact that she lost her family twice and she loved to read.  She was adopted by foster parents and was lucky enough to live with them through the war. There is very few facts about her appearance, so basically in my imagination she is blank. We can still create the image of her parents or Rudy, but somehow the main character is lost in her reading. And it is a very weak point of the book for young adults. You need to give them a vision of the hero, her voice, her special manner to walk .  everything. Otherwise, nobody  will care . And she didn't exactly stole most of her books. For some reason, the Author decided to cut even this corner, creating a library and cookies and smooth escapes. Why?<br />4. Death. probably the most ambitious character of the book. At lease that's what I thought. It was a damn good idea. I almost imagined this Angel of Darkness sweeping after the bombing and shooting and burning was done...Her grim and joy of being back to work full time. I wanted her to be mean and Evil, maybe with little bit of occasional sympathy for innocent. Maybe that would create stronger connection between Hitler anddeath. Nope. The Death part was even less convincing. Too much of melancholia, generalization and spoilers. The language she spoke was too neat, too well-thought-of, even her bleak ironic statements left me untouched...I could not resist and skipped some of her useless sentiments. Sorry, Author.<br /> Summery:<br /> The book is shallow. The plot was fine, but there wasn't enough dynamic events to keep me interested. No atmosphere, no images in front of my eyes as  I was reading it. So, no vision for us. Only words. Thousands of words from different books. The reader doesn't need that many explanation of word itself. He/she needs to know the characters of the book, their souls, understand their silence and I didn't find it here. We spent four years living next to the Book Thief and I can't even tell you how did she look like when she was fourteen. And if you ask me about Ann Frank, I can tell you how was her hair combed the day she was taken away. Now,  do you see what I mean?death. Nope. The Death part was even less convincing. Too much of melancholia, generalization and spoilers. The language she spoke was too neat, too well-thought-of, even her bleak ironic statements left me untouched...I could not resist and skipped some of her useless sentiments. Sorry, Author.<br /> Summery:<br /> The book is shallow. The plot was fine, but there wasn't enough dynamic events to keep me interested.

B00008BXJG|5.0|This is hands down Bon Scott's best album. Every song is great!<br /><br />Highway to Hell 5/5 - Everyone knows this one. Fantastic riff.<br /><br />Girls Got Rhythm 5/5 - Another popular one, and another sex song.<br /><br />Walk All Over You 5/5 - Great intro, great chorus. Another sex song.<br /><br />Touch Too Much 5/5 - Love the chorus. Another sex song.<br /><br />Beating Around the Bush 4/5 - Love the riff. I think it's about a man who catches his girlfriend cheating on him.<br /><br />Shot Down in Flames 5/5 - Love the riff! This is about a man trying to pick up a woman but being shot down.<br /><br />Get it Hot 4/5 - A nice short song, I think this is also about sex.<br /><br />If You Want Blood (You've Got It) 5/5 - Best song on here and my favorite Bon Scott song. Love this song, riff, chorus everything.<br /><br />Love Hungry Man 4/5 - Gets a little repetitive but a great song nonetheless. Another sex song.<br /><br />Night Prowler 4/5 - Their slowest song ever. Great song with great lyrics. From what Malcolm said, it's about a boy sneaking into his girlfriends bedroom when her parents are asleep. Of course this is the song that people claimed is what inspired Richard Ramirez, what a load of crap!<br /><br />Anyway, Best Bon Scott album, Buy it!!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I received this item within 2 days and love it so far. I have had it for 2 weeks and have been very pleased. I haven't dropped my new phone yet, but it seems that it would protect  well. The product is flexible, but hard all at the same time! I may very well buy another just in case.<br /><br />Side Note: I used scrap book paper, cut it to size, and placed on the inside of the case to decorate the back. Great cheap way to get a personalized case!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is for those people who love a good romance story but who also like to get into the heads of the characters.

B00008WT5E|5.0|This is what I'm talkin' about. Best Bon Scott album until Highway.<br />this is when they grew up a little bit and started singing about things besides sex.<br />Here is the song list.<br /><br />Rock 'n' Roll Damnation 5/5 - Hands down the best song on here. Incredible<br /><br />Down Payment Blues 4/5 - Another great song with a great riff and great lyrics. About a man who's behind on his payments of course.<br /><br />Gimme a Bullet 5/5 - Great riff that kind of reminds me of Highway to Hell. This is about a man who's trying to get through a break-up.<br /><br />Riff Raff 3/5 - Pretty good but not my favorite, nice solos. This is pretty much the Let there be rock of the album. This is Slash's favorite AC/DC song so i gotta respect that.<br /><br />Sin City 5/5 - LOVE this song! Great riff and all. I think it's about Las Vegas. Joe Perry's favorite AC/DC song.<br /><br />What's Next to the Moon 5/5 - Great bluesy song. Love the riff and lyrics. its about a man trying to get rid of his wife/girlfriend by tying her to railroad tracks.<br /><br />Gone Shootin' 5/5 - One of the best riffs ever! This is about a man who's dating a woman that does heroin.<br /><br />Up to My Neck in You 4/5 - Another sex song by them. Love the solo.<br /><br />Kicked in the Teeth 4/5 - Great solo. It's about a man who's been two-timed by his girlfriend.<br /><br />Absolutely a great purchase for any rock fan. Highly recommend this!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I ordered Thor for my 13 year old son through Amazon.com for the excellent price, but I have to admit the story was fun and the actors were terrific.  Beginning with an episode depicting Thor's origins as a mythological god, the story then picks up at Thor's banishment to Earth and his relationships with humans.  This story is one of the Marvel comic hero stories which introduce The Avengers one at a time (Captain America is another Marvel superhero from last year). The story has many action scenes and Chris Hemsworth is delightful as the displaced god of thunder.  My son watches it way too much, but I am glad to watch it when he gets to choose the movie for our monthly movie slumber party.

0307887448|5.0|This is easily one of the most enjoyable novels I've read. I've finished the Hunger Games trilogy and the Millennium Trilogy recently. Never got into Twilight nor its stepchild Fifty Shades.<br /><br />I'm more into Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut novels for their philosophical overtones, Tolkien and Martin for their fantasy epics, and now Ernest Cline for his ability to blend both with style, grace, class, and humor.<br /><br />I don't write reviews much but this is a must-read for anyone, especially for those who have been in the Customer Service business (specifically with computer tech support).

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Like others, I am amazed this movie wasn't a great hit in the theater! I read Burroughs in my formative years and loved the action and heroism in the stories. Although it had been some 45 years since I read the stories, the movie captured them with great special effects and never ending action! I'm glad I bought the DVD the day it was released!

0345505387|3.0|I spent a pleasant afternoon reading The Exile. For me, I was looking forward to an alternate POV (i.e. Murtaugh's and Jamie's) instead of seeing the story from Claire's perspective. To be honest, I didn't think the POV change enriched story. I thought Gabaldon would include more of Jamie's internal monologue as he falls in love with Claire, but really this story retelling is not particularly romantic.<br /><br />Instead, we meet a new character, Kenneth, who doesn't add to the story and is actually a distraction. Finally, I didn't like the way Jamie was drawn (although this is really just a matter of opinion. It wasn't that the image contrasted with what I had in my head, it was that I thought he looked downright UGLY). I thought the faces of each character changed dramatically from frame to frame and were not consistent enough that I knew who was whom. It was hard to discern Murtaugh from Dougal, or even from Jamie if the scene was too dark to pick out his red hair.<br /><br />I do question whether the small changes needed to fit the format of at graphic novel (rather than a lengthy novel) alter the mythology of the Outlander story. For instance, *SPOILER* if Laoughaire really was 'tricked' into duping Claire, doesn't that negate some of the passages from Echo?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its pretty cool. its a little hard. I was fun to play though.I wouldn't recommend this game to people who hate wasting time.
B001P06GX4|2.0|It's not like this isn't fun, but it just isn't a 5 star experience.<br /><br />I don't like how playing 2 or 3 isn't really great.  A game should be easily played with 2 or 3 or it just isn't a great game.<br /><br />The likelihood of pieces getting lost with this game is great and if it does, how fair is it?
B000O8OTNC|4.0|not something for putting a razor sharp finish on knives, but a good portable sharpener for keeping knives sharp in the field, or for a quick touch up.  The tapered ceramic stick is great for serrated blades, but of course it takes time to do them right.
0307916812|2.0|It's always sad when you are enjoying a series of books, and you get then you get to the one that you makes you stop.  (I treated the two Percy series as one).<br /><br />I am an artist, and as my reviewer name would imply, I consume a lot of audiobooks while I'm working.  Listening to this book, I kept finding myself checking to see how far into it I was, thinking, \\"Well, if I'm more than half way through I'll suffer through the rest of it...\\"  Eventually I realized that I was forcing myself do to something unpleasant, and unnecessary.  I have over 10,000 books on my \\"to read\\" list.<br /><br />There is one bright spot, and it's for the audiobook only.  Because the Roman versions of the gods are different, Joshua Swanson, the reader, had to come up with new voices for each.  The voice he uses for Mars is an absolute lifting of the Lt. Aldo Raine character played by Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds.  Still, there is not enough Mars to make the book worth while.<br /><br />So, bye bye Percy.  I'm on to another series.
1609613937|5.0|This book is brilliant. I really enjoyed reading it and so far love making all the yummy food from it. First week in, lost 2 1/2 pounds and really don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Easy to understand and very helpful if you want to make positive changes to your diet.
160094048X|5.0|Sorry for all the caps but seriously, I love this book so. damn. much. I want a copy for every room. And an oven for every room. Cookies all the time for everyone!!
0345803493|5.0|I absolutely loved this book & the entire series. I recommended it to all of my girlfriends and they are addicted to it just like me! When i ordered this book i saw that it was used & in ok conditions... When i recieved the book it was perfect... it looked like the book was never even opened! It was the cheapest i could find the book so i figured what the hell i dont need to spend 15 dollars on a brand new book.. who cares if it's been used already.. well the book was in great condition!<br />Highly recommend this book & to buy it from this company!:)
0451228731|5.0|I rarely feel strongly enough about a book to return to Amazon and write a review but Daemon was so interesting in plot and engaging in pacing that I felt compelled to do so. Enough has been said in previous reviews about the mechanics and plot so suffice it to say that if you have any interest in technology or the effects of the information age on society you will enjoy this novel.

It's of very high quality and is very durable and the features are very realistic.  He absolutely loves it and has been taking it everywhere with him.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Although the book is good it's kinda just a 200+ page advertisement for Mark of Athena.<br />Riordan had many caricatures to introduse in a single book and did a pretty good job.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is fantastic. Every time I look through it I find something new. You can stack different effects on different pictures and any pictures you make you can make into collages or anything you want, really. It really is a wonderful app. and considering the fact that it's free is even more fantastic. Easy to use, would recommend for anyone.
0345803485|1.0|First of all sorry if I write something wrong, english is not my first language. Started reading and could not finish. Why is this even romance?? Started reading it because of how popular it was, now I regret it so so much. I think society now a days are confused with four-letter word that starts with the letter L. Lust and Love... He plainly liked her for the sex, that is lust and pornografy put together,yuck. I know every women loves a hot attractive guy, I do, but not an abusive one!!! So being good looking makes it good to hit someone? I am sure if Christian was ugly more people will hate him. Also I want to say if he was abused when he was little does not make it right to do the same to other. Also is ironical that his name is Christian which means follower of Christ. Not to be religious but this is so wrong like it or not. Yes I know this is just a writing but this is how some people thinks today, and they think it's right. To end with, put yourself in Ana shoes, will you constantly apologize to someone who use you as a sex-toy and beats you??? I am 18 and have a boyfriend, he is handsome, but I like most about him is his personality, the way he smiles, being always a gentleman and treats me right. If he was abusive and sex-mentally ill I would leave him for good. This book was just disgusting and will never understand how people enjoy it, although I think people reads it because it's \\"entertaining\\". Gracias.
006117758X|5.0|Not for the faint of heart. But it's honest, funny, and poignant. His sense of humor is unexpected; you never see the punch line coming. Same with the fist. Like Tony Montana in Scarface, Bukowski never fails to tell the truth. Even when he lies.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I absolutely LOVE the alien design.  Love, love, love, love, LOVE.<br /><br />The very end seemed like it was just tacked on to tie in the Alien franchise.  That was annoying.  And it was soooo stupid that they took their helmets off. Like anyone would really do that.  Then again, it's not as if I've been in that situation or any situation resembling it before, so I'm not feeling qualified to have a real opinion.  And it's just a movie.<br /><br />The music is memorable and \\"sweeping\\" at the right moments.  Made everything seem even more massive!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I received the item within a reasonable period of time. It was as advertised and it works fine. Everything went as expected so I rate it as satisfactory.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|As usual, another great performance by Denzel Washington.  Ryan Reynolds was pretty good as well and shows signs of becoming an excellent actor.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Had intended to look into getting a Bee Gees album for quite some time.  Had always liked their sound and artistry.<br /><br />Finally looked at the Amazon offerings and reviews and selected the Ultimate Bee Gees(2 CD).  I was not disappointed at all.  These two CD's capture the essence of the Bee Gees.  Took me back quite a few years!  I would recommend this CD to anyone who simply wants to enjoy the good music.
0385341008|5.0|If I could read only one book, I would read this one again and again.  I felt like I was a part of this group of characters.  I appreciated the writing style and found it very rich, but yet it flowed so smoothly.  I laughed, I cried.  I am giving this book to all my gal pals.
1475143389|5.0|I have been working out for about a year now - and started using this book (along with Michael's other books, 50 myths, and his companion cookbook) 3 months ago.  I followed the workout plan with a few minor modifications and ate according to the guidelines provided in the book for gaining muscle.  While I still have a way to go, I have observed fairly significant increased muscle and definition.  Even my former personal trainer that I used before starting this program commented that I have undergone a \\"Total Body Transformation\\" - I can't wait to see what develops over the next few months!<br /><br />I would also definitely recommend purchasing Michael Matthew's other book, \\"Muscle Myths: 50 Health and Fitness Mistakes you didn't know you were making\\" - as it helped to focus my efforts and dispel some of the falsehoods that I believed based upon what I had been told by trainers, friends, etc concerning health/fitness.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Yes this is TESTAMENT, one of the first bands fromt he Bay area in thrash metal genre to start a new style of music that continued until this day. The are the pioneers of thrash beside Slayer, anthrax, Megadeth, Overkill and so forth. The truth is, they have stayed true to their rhythm throughout the years and have not gone astray as many other bands. The guitar, the guitar solos, and the drums are just as good as they were in the 80's. Listening to Testament privious albums you are definetely guaranteed PURE THRASH METAL and nothing less. Chuck's vocals are awesome, guitar riffs are slendid, and the drums puts a top notch on the rhythm. You will never go wrong by getting this album.
B0041KXWWI|4.0|Intelligent, tense, frosty drama with thriller overtones.  It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great.  She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing.  2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors.  Still, in a vacuum, one of the better films of 2005
B003274QH6|5.0|I've started watching this Breaking Bad series only years after the first episode had already aired. Boy were we in for a surprise when we started watching the first episode. And then another and another.. We've watched the entire first two seasons in one weekend. For me this was a must have on the highest commercial HD-resolution disc out there, Blu-ray, hands down. Ordered first three seasons for a despicable great price, right here on Amazon. Even after import-duties it was still a catch (I'm from Europe). All characters in this great series are likeable except for Skyler maybe. i Just cannot get into her irrational moodswings and motivations. Then again I feel the actress who is playing Skyler still does an excellent job, because it looks pretty real.
B002WCLG48|2.0|I rented this DVD to see if it would get me off the fence in checking out the HALO video games. The first couple of stories by the AI were decent with above average presentation and an interesting history lesson of the world but after that the following episodes dropped drastically in quality.<br /><br />Poor to average animation, canned phrases, melodramatic characters and storylines that were so basic they tasted like a bland cereal. I got about halfway through before I threw up all over the place.<br /><br />ANIMATION: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C to C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C to C plus.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very addicting!! It's the kind of book you start and don't put down until your done!! LOVED IT!  Casting the movie in my head!
B002OI3HM4|4.0|I'm an Allen fan. For me this was not a one of his great films, but was an entertaining, diverting one, with two terrific performances by Javier<br />Bardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decent one by Scarlett Johanssen.<br /><br />The key flaw -- Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexity of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film, but for me it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from ultimately feeling deeper and more complex.<br /><br />None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.<br /><br />Interestingly, even more than most of Allen's films this seems to ignite very different reactions from viewer to viewer, so I'd encourage you to check it out for yourself if you have any interest in the elements.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|Dead ghost lady who lost her son seeks revenge on all the towns children, holding somekind of unseen power over the children she convinces them to kill themselves, and no one can stop this vengful ghost, so this story makes no sence to me, the background scenses are very nice, acting is desent, but thats it, has a bad ending that frustrates you, and the killing goes on, boo
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Any author who ranks 1-3 on thr N. Y. Times book review list garners my attention. But this so called novel is complete trash. It is far from erotic but, rather, Pornographic with a capital \\"P\\". And please tell the author and the editors that when Mr. Grey flies his helicopter (I didn't get much further than that) those of us who served in the military know that one never uses \\"over and out\\", as he does twice in two pages.  \\"Over\\" means that you are continuing the conversation ansd are expecting an answer; \\"out\\" means you are eding the conversation and \\"signing off\\".
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it!! Literally couldn't put it down! I stayed up all night and day reading! ! Anyone who says otherwise is crazy!! Lol!
0345803485|4.0|It was a real page turner!! I did like the book. I will say the idea of a woman who is a virgin starting here first relationship with a \\"dom\\" who wants to tie her up and such is a bit hard to chew. Not to mention she is only 21 and never had a relationship..I did like it, you just cannot over think it or you will ruin it because its just not feesable.
0142414476|5.0|Great story and my nephew (4yrs) loved it in English and in Spanish. It is the story of the three little pigs but cleverly told from the perspective of the \\"innocent\\" wolf.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I have been a big fan of Testament since The Legacy and I can tell you that this is a Tremendous blend of the early Testament staples (Practice, Souls, Ritual) and the newer aggressive Testament (The Gathering, Demonic..etc.) I was hesitant at first because the last few releases were good but not GREAT! I was liking another DDP (Dublin Death Patrol)disc over a new Testament disc but boy was I wrong. The vocals on Dark Roots are crystal clear and Chuck Billy at his best! Skolnik has really turned up the power and the rest of the band is as tight as all hell.  If you do decide to pick it up, go with the Limited Edition. 4 bonus tracks include covers of Powerslave (amazing), Animal Magnetism (odd for his vocal style but really brutal) and Dragon Attack from Queen along with a bonus DVD stuffed full of more Metal flavored goodies than anyone has right to have. If you have been looking for something to reaffirm your faith in metal...look no further, this IS the one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!! I read this book all night and day until I was done! Very addicting! I am casting the movie in my head!

B002NEFL8W|4.0|The battery grip does what it should and is a great addition to the Canon 7d.  It accepts both AA batteries or the prefered lithium Canon batteries (2 of them).  It integrates well into the camera and presents no real problems but one:  When the camera is attached to a tripod, its nearly impossible to change batteries.  It's also adds some weight to a already heavy camera body.  But, the weight was worth it.
B004U8VUUC|3.0|Having read all the positive reviews, I was a bit disappointed.  Moved kind of slow.  I kept waiting for something to happen that never did.
B007UXSDYU|5.0|This movie succeeded at doing something few movies can do these days.  Something few people seem to care about.  Not much was laid out for the masses but a lot was laid out for those that can still think on their own.  Much like an old school good mystery, you were invited to both know a little about a lot of things then think it through.  Maybe the people giving bad reviews should learn a little and especially how to think by reading or watching some old mysteries.    Not saying this was a mystery movie by any stretch, just be prepared to think, reason, conclude and deduce.  It's not the challenge of 6th Sense because things are clear if you pay attention, but obviously many small hints were overlooked by people that reviewed it poorly.    My definition of a good book or movie is one that can leave me hungry for more, leave things hanging, not answer every question, not find closure.  Anything that fits that bill does the most wonderful thing.  It asks me to think  to create, to explain, to solve.  I just feel if you must have closure about everything you miss the point.  Go have a good meal and enough closure.  Read a book to stimulate your imagination, watch The Divide to stimulate the imagination.    I am going to toss out a lot of spoilers here and recommend you not read this review before seeing the movie.  If you look at many of the reviews, they point to plot flaws, unexplained events and the like.  I am going to try to explain some of those things in hopes people that see the movie and are on the edge of liking it might read this after and \\"get it.\\"  Obviously a lot of people didn't.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    SPOILER ALERT #1    Why didn't people show the effects of rad poisoning equally?  If you paid attention you would notice the most severely effected were also the people closest or even touched by or touching the 'invaders.'  What is going to be on the outside of a biohazard suit?  Enough said I hope.SPOILER ALERT #2    Why did the invaders take the girl out but not anyone else?  Why were they then sealed in?  Recall the bird flu of a few years ago and the limited supply of vaccine.  Assuming the radiation was affecting a mega city like NYC, would there be enough Decontamination chambers and chemicals for the amount of people affected?  Doubtful.  Would you prefer the adults be treated or the children?  Bare in mind a child has a much higher chance of success than most adults as well.  Simple truth is they took the child because they couldn't help the rest.  Look at the ID tag when Josh went out.    SPOILER ALERT #3    Much like Lord of the Flies, there was a slow degeneration into depravity.  Some folks thought things were too graphic, too visceral.  I say it had to be on these levels to form the continuity required for the end.  If you saw the movie, imagine jumping past any of the events and ask yourself if you wouldn't have had more questions about why it ended the way it did.  I tried to just blot out one scene randomly and it weakens the end to do so.  All of the grit and dirt HAD to be there or the end is watered down.    SPOILER ALERT #4    I felt the characters were well defined by their actions and who needs to know their life history if their actions carry their definition?  You did need to know Mickey was a paranoid survivor of 9/11 and that he likely lost his family during that, but beyond that, the only things you needed were defined well enough.  Eva wasn't a nurse, but was a caring and gentle soul...shown throughout much of the movie.  Her bf was a lawyer, and a wimp...amply illustrated.  Josh and the others were typical NYC maybe even Bronx boys.  Brash, bold, loud, maybe stereotypical but there you are.  His half brother was something of a gentle soul as well, played the guitar and helped Eva to sleep some nights...spoken of if you listened.    SPOILER ALERT #5    Who cared what happened to the world outside?  In fact, my only complaint wasthe end when the survivor walked out.  It played to some of the empathy a good movie needs to generate, but not enough to have been worth it.  I didn't mind her getting out, it followed the thing with Mickey about the gun, etc...  But, I felt it would have been better and the movie better served to just have her face shown for a few moments.  You generate the empathy, but leave all those scrumptious unanswered questions.  And, much leeway for a sequel.    SPOILER ALERT #6    Why did the survivor turn on the others at the end and desert them?  Go from saint to sinner in an instant it seemed?  Consider the slow build, toss that as too weak.  Add the attempted rape, toss that, she was stronger than that even.  Add the forced mutilation, toss that, stronger mettle still.  Look at who she deserted then.  Mickey that really wanted to die and she knew that, understood it maybe before he did even.  Her bf that I think she knew couldn't handle what she knew she was going to find.  I knew he was going to be a mess from watching the way thing developed.  He was going to need a lot more psyche attention then he was likely going to get.  She knew that as well.  Better off dead than suffering the rest of his life where he had descended.  Maybe add her budding affection for the one that was killed, but leave it at that.  Simple fact is, she was the only one left that could leave that place and have any chance of surviving and holding on to any sanity.    Just saying it all tied together nicely if you listened and didn't skip those 'boring' parts.

1401937519|5.0|Anita writes clearly and intelligently about the circumstances leading up to her NDE, her change in understanding, followed by the instant cessation of the cancer process in her body.<br /><br />This book will challenge many people's taken for granted views of who we are and what we're here for as a species. According to my understanding of what Anita says, we are not here to 'learn lessons' or to 'achieve enlightenment' or be saved by the Grace of God. In fact, we're not here to be 'spiritual' at all. We already are spiritual. As expansive and interconnected consciousness, inseparable from the Source of All Things, we are, and always have been, perfect. There is nothing to achieve here except to express our own uniqueness as loving strands of the One. THIS is the main show. Right here, right now.<br /><br />Thanks, Anita.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|50 shades of grey was a huge let-down. I understand why is it a bestseller although I certainly wish it wasn't. Simply put, it feels like its just an opportunity for women to read erotic porn without feeling guilty about it. Now, on to why I don't like it: The repetitive and simplistic use of language. The writer uses the words,  \\" very/too gloriously/breathtaking good-looking\\", \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"bite her lips\\" over and over again. It was as if, she ran out of vocabulary or creative juices to come up with any other description. This sort of repetitive and tiresome descriptive technique is a show of bad technique and lazy writing. She uses sweeping, generalized descriptions that one could easily come up with in a casual conversation with a friend over coffee: \\"Check out that guy. He is good-looking\\". I very much prefer well-chosen details that uniquely shapes the protagonists in this story.<br /><br />Although the protagonist is supposedly a young woman in her early 20s and she writes from the protagonist's point of view, her view is so one-dimensional and naive that is almost unbelievable. It's hard to identify with a story that leaves so little to imagination. Simply put, her writing style is boring. Also, its difficult to empathize with Christian Grey who just seems like a sick pervert that needed help and who is not someone most people can identify with: He owns an empire, he is breathtakingly good looking, is filthy rich and loves a simple lady and in his words, \\"loves to pleasure\\". Do you know or remotely know anyone like that? To be able to sympathize with someone, you need to be able to at least, at a certain level, relate to that character. In the first book, although some information was divulged about his background, not enough was given to make him relatable.<br /><br />Summary: uninteresting writing style. Good plot, that can be potentially made into a great movie. Great marketing, hence it sells well.

0385486804|5.0|The most important thing in life is to be bold,and live life to the fullest. Chris was a bold person looking for the beauty in life rather than to be a typical person. Most people do not think in these terms. I can relate to Chris trying to do it his way. It would have been easy for him to go on auto pilot in his life but he searched for true happiness. In the end he did not plan well enough to complete his adventure. I am sad for him,and his family that he didn't plan better. He wanted to commune with nature, to live off the land. Very brave, and bold. Most people do not live that way each day.
0345803485|5.0|On the third book (fifty shades of freed). I really enjoyed these books, yes their are some boring parts. But all the events that happen and people that come in the book.

0345803485|1.0|Seriously??? This was annoying, depressing, horribly written, and ultimately boring. I've read a few reviews that say the book is popular with people who don't read. I have to wonder if these people also don't have sex, because what's portrayed in the book bears no likeness to any kind of relationship one would want to be in.<br /><br />It makes me ill to think that the author is raking in royalties while truly talented writers can't get published.
0061969656|5.0|I have to confess that, though I love this series, I found the last two novels in the series a little lacklustre and feared that it had jumped-the-shark after the utterly amazing [[ASIN:0061149047 Lords of the North]]. One particular fear I had was that this novel would involve yet more fighting in Benfleet (or Essex area) as the previous two novels had (probably owing to Cornwell's Essex background).<br /><br />Which is why this novel made such a refreshing break. Instead of Essex and random trips to places like Holland and Scotland, Uhtred goes to places that are relevant to the plot of the series and teaches you things at the same time (e.g. when he goes to the ruined Roman town of Wroxeter, Shropshire - which he says was bigger than London in its day).<br /><br />One thing I'd forgotten about Uhtred is that he is a deeply compelling central charactor - rough on the surface but good underneath, and not in a way that can be predicted or fathomed. Uhtred has also changed and grown up from what he was in the first three novels, becoming less fiery tempered and more sensible, though still able to surprise.<br /><br />The plot also comes across as well thought-out and clever. Where the previous two novels fell too readily into a predictable small battle...filler...big battle, this plot has a staggering amount of twists and turns and a fully fleshed-out mystery at the heart of the plot - the war that surpasses human understanding.<br /><br />Last of all, I had read [[ASIN:B0055X4A2Q the previous novel]] in the series and had forgotten how powerful the audio books versions of this series are. Where [[ASIN:B0085RZURI Sword Song]] was read by a man who sounded posher than Hyacinth Bucket, this audio CD makes the wise choice of Stephen Perring, who has the rugged edge to make a convincing Uhtred.<br />If you haven't tried any of this series yet, then I thoroughly recommend it on audio book. The first person narrative really lends itself to audio and fully brings out the grittiness of Uhtred's narration, to the point that you could swear he was in the room with you!<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up, this book was a really excellent continuation of the series and felt like a real advance in the story. I hope and pray to the Gods that Cornwell will be able to finish the Saxon stories with the same brilliance as he started them. Let this novel be a sign of more great works to come...ittiness of Uhtred's narration, to the point that you could swear he was in the room with you!<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up, this book was a really excellent continuation of the series and felt like a real advance in the story.

0312323867|3.0|I read this only because I saw the movie Something Borrowed. Which I only watched because Ginnifer Goodwin from ABC's Once Upon a Time was in it (SnowWhite). OUAT is the only show I watch....ever besides Sprout Channel and ESPN. You can tell who controls the TV in my house. So anyway, at the end of the movie, Darcy (Kate Hudson) goes to England. Then I heard that the movie was based on a book and it had a sequel. Something Borrowed was checked out so I read this book. It is Very chick-lit and had a neat bow on top happy ending for everyone. And I mean Everyone. Darcy is not likable even when she \\"changes\\". It pretty much rehashes the first book from Darcy's point of view for the first couple of chapters before she actually leaves for England. Predictable ending, But easy to read.

B008BRC6NS|3.0|JLo has recently put out some great songs (On the Floor, Dance Again) and she's had some great songs in the past (Waiting for Tonite, Let's Get Loud). It should have been easy for her to do a fabulous greatest hits collection. This just isn't it. It starts off well, but around the middle it just falls apart and does not recover until the very end. The remixes are particularly repetitive and unnecessary. I was hoping some of these older songs would have been updated and given a fresh new sound consistent with her latest material. Instead the remixes are in a totally different direction. The result is like having a creme-filled donut that has humus instead of creme in it. I was hoping to never hear anything from her Spanish album ever again. Time has not been kind to that album. It seemed like a brave effort then, now it is obvious it was a huge misstep. I am also surprised at the version of Waiting for Tonite that was included. It would have been easy to update this song to give a modern dance sound but they didn't. A lot of lost opportunities here.

B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I have to say this is one of The Offspring's most unique albums.  There are a lot of different styles (for them) on here.  Don't get me wrong, there's no mistaking it is The Offspring and they have their signature, and probably about 5 songs are the very typical sound & style, but they've also done some experiments this time around.  One of them I actually don't care for, but its bound to be a radio hit called \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\" which to me is like \\"ok, we need a more urban track to appeal to a greater audience\\".<br /><br />The album begins with two somewhat typical Offspring anthems, but not in a bad way at all.  I'm torn between which track I like better and I'm leaning towards \\"The Future Is Now.\\"  Amazing song.<br />As for \\"Days Go By,\\" there is no mistake the album took this song's title.  Very strong, melodic, catchy, and a refreshing sounding song... superb song writing, they haven't lost it!<br /><br />\\"All I Have Left is You\\" is somewhat a ballad-esque track that sounds like a different band member takes the mic at first, but it turns out because of the more calm delivery it's actually Dexter Holland not belting out his usual nasal fare.  It's another catchy chorus and powerful song.<br /><br />Then out of nowhere comes a funky beat-laden cut with Spanish horns (and some Spanish lines even and playful lyrics; \\"Tiki tiki tiki tiki tiki, Waddup holmes? you hijo de puta! pendejo! Cabron\\") is \\"OC Guns,\\" and could easily be a single.<br /><br />And finally one of the biggest surprises of the album is a re-recorded track from The Offspring's 1992 album Ignition, called \\"Dirty Magic.\\"  This was an obvious tribute to Nirvana just a year after Nevermind was released, and if it wasn't then it sure was an homage to the grunge scene during that time.  This was actually one of my favorite tracks from Ignition and it was a shocker to hear again... this version slows the tempo down a tad and adds some more depth with layers of backup vocals and other guitar parts.  Solid!<br /><br />In my opinion their last 2 albums were pretty much filler in comparison to this album with nothing really amazing, nor terrible.  But Days Go By has one of the strongest singles (the self-titled cut) since \\"Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\\" and let's be honest, a much better single with more staying power.  With so many great albums, The Offspring continues to amaze and proves to be a band that never rests on their laurels.her guitar parts.

034580404X|5.0|My husband heard about this triology on book radio.  So I ordered all three.  Yes the book had some pretty graphic sounding scenes but it made the book.  I do think it is an adult book definitely!! But, it had a great story line and could make someone at any age feel the hope for love, romance, and a life of luxury.  The story line gets better as you read the books.  I read all three books in about 2 weeks.  They were hard to put down. I wanted to see what would happen next.  Great, must read books!!!

1466401885|5.0|I loved Beautiful Disaster because it brought two people together that needed love more then they orginally thought. Travis is a play boy and Abby is a girl running from her past. Together they make a whole of messed upness, but they click. Travis changed for her because he loves her and she takes some time to adjust. The story is about growing up and findning love. It is a page turner and I would read it again. I hope Jamie Mcguire continues the story somehow because it really is a good story and should be continued.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|So I wanted to see this movie ever since it first came to theater, but I never had the chance to see it. However, when it came to dvd I bought it and it was worth the wait! I wasn't expecting much in the way of cinematography since it was supposed to look like the whole movie was filmed on handheld cameras, but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't nearly as jerky or nauseating as Cloverfield. I was also very happy with the plot, acting and character development. Once again, I wasn't expecting much from this relatively unknown cast, but I was pleasantly surprised again. They portrayed their respective characters and their emotions very convincingly. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie that I am happy to own!

B0045F8XRS|4.0|W.A.S.P is one of my favorite bands of all time. Blackie and company deliver with almost every album. Now I'm not a big fan of the blood, guts, sex, ect ect they had in the early years. I focus on the talent of a band. Now believe me WASP has as much talent as everyone else. It wasnt really shown until The Headless Children. But I will give this album props because of the songs I Wanna Be Somebody, BAD, Tormentor, Hellion, and LOVE machine. This album is catchy as hell and proves that WASP had something different to add than most other bands in this genre at that time. Now yes I didnt say I liked Animal, and truth is...its an okay songs when you look at what they had in the future (Headless Children, Crimson Idol). Overall, if you are just getting into WASP buy this album to learn of their beginnings and you too will see that over time, they aged really well and released better albums.

0345803493|1.0|I only read book 1 and will NOT be reading any more.  It was terribly written and sooo boring! Ana is basically raped in the boathouse and beaten several times..not to mention the constant sex which is ridiculous.......and we are suppose to want more of this outrageous stuff!  This is no love story; if you want a love story that you can not put down, read \\"Paradise\\" by Judith McNaught.  It blows this one away big time.

B003HYNB34|3.0|Each doctor brings something different to the table so it's not easy to compare them.<br /><br />9th doctor: Christopher Eccleston was strong in showing the darkness of the last of the time lords, but when it came to showing light heartedness he would sometimes be caught forcing his facial expressions.<br /><br />10th doctor: David Tennant was strong in showing vulnerability and his sadness and lonliness was palpable to the audience. but again there was sometimes forcing of his facial expressions during scenes where he was showing intense shock or anger.<br /><br />11th doctor: Matt Smith does not force his acting at all. There's no pushing and it comes across as natural at all times. He is especially strong in showing the doctor's lighthearted madness. For many this might make him the best performer out of the three and therefore the best doctor; however, he lacks vulnerability in his approach. With the two previous actors you could often see the despair, lonliness and fear that the doctor holds inside- for them the madness the doctor portrayed was often an attempt to hide these vulnerabilities. Where as Matt Smith's doctor seems to just be somewhat mad...simply because he is mad. And to his credit Smith portrays this very well actually, but it's not as interesting because it was the doctor's vulnerability that made him so easy to relate to even though he is an alien time lord from outer space that travels in a 1960's police box. There are so many scenes where Smith chooses not to show any fear in the face of danger, while Tennant and Eccleston often did. If the doctor isn't scared about what's about to happen then why should the audience care what's going to happen? I found myself drifting in my attention sometimes. The main problem is that the writing in seasons 5 & 6 is significantly less interesting than it was during Tennant's reign as the doctor, which means Matt Smith has less rich material to work with. (Not always- \\"Vincent & the Doctor\\" in season 5 and \\"The God Complex\\" in season 6 for instance are well written episodes).<br /><br />All in all I don't find seasons 5 & 6 to be nearly as good as previous seasons, but most of that has to do with the writing rather than the new doctor. Upon investigation I found out that indeed the writers did change at the start of series 5. That explains a lot. But don't get me wrong- it's still Dr. Who so it's still fun to watch, but I find that previous seasons were much more memorable.
B005JABSB6|5.0|These Sharp glasses will not get you any ladies at the bar, they will however get you into the Blue-ray you are watching.

Great battery life, even straight out of the box!They arrived just as described and in one piece. I have a sharp LED TV and they pair very well. I cannot speak to any technical specs on the glasses, thats what Sharp's website is for, but I can tell you it is a must have for any Sharp 3D TV owners out there. Got a great deal on amazon, very happy.
0345477618|5.0|This book is, quite frankly, the absolute best \\"making of\\" book I've ever read. I've been a huge Star Wars fan my whole life, and still I was constantly learning new things throughout this book. I'm just amazed by how much new information is brought to light. And it includes large portions of many early drafts of the script! This was the clear highlight for me, and it alone justifies the purchase price. For the first time, you can actually read the VERY different adventures of Starkiller! Plus, the hardcover edition comes with a very cool, very enlightening interview with George Lucas conducted just after the release of the movie about the backstory.

B000WC2URM|5.0|Si tratta dell'allestimento del Marinskij Theatr di St Peterburg, con l'orchestra diretta da Valery Gergief e le coregrafie di Kirill Simonov.<br />Il personaggio di Maria è interpretato da Irina Golub, il principe Schiaccianoci è Leonid Sarafanov<br />E' uno Schiaccianoci che appare \\"anticonvenzionale\\", anche se paradossalmente l'intenzione di Simonov era quella di rifarsi al modello ispiratore della favola di Hoffmann. Impresa difficile quella tentata da Simonov, e riuscita, a nostro avviso, quasi del tutto. In molte scene protagonista è l'ironia, non senza un certo impatto, impatto talvolta a livello stridente, voluto da Simonov, contrasto che è evidenziato ancor più dalla atmosfera di sogno della meravigliosa musica di TChaikovskij diretta in modo superbo da Gergiev. La qualità della registrazione audio è peraltro eccellente.<br />L'unico punto su cui avrei suggerito di fare diversamente: la scena dei fiocchi di neve, il costume nero delle ballerine (nero=neve=???), non rende giustizia alla bravura delle stesse, i cui virtuosismi e la scena d'insieme non si apprezzano appieno con lo sfondo scuro della scenografia. E nel finale, l'apoteosi con la torta, idea magnifica che andrebbe perfezionata, non delegata integralmente alla scenografia.<br />La coreografia talvolta sembra privilegiare la narrazione, la fanno da padrone gli attori più che i ballerini, e nelle occasioni in cui c'è lo spazio per mostrarne la bravura, c'è la sensazione che si poteva pensare a qualcosa di più all'altezza della tradizione del Marinskij. Sulle celeberrime variazioni, un po' sottotono la \\"danza russa\\", mentre molto azzeccata la \\"danza araba\\".<br />In conclusione, un DVD da prendere e vedere più di una volta, per scoprire e assaporare i mille particolari che in unica prima visione possono sfuggire.

B005LAII0I|4.0|Mirror Mirror is a modern re-telling of the old Snow White fairy tale.  Based upon live action (rather than animation), the film is loaded with special effects, gorgeous imagery, and action.<br /><br />One of the main strengths of the film is the active role Snow White takes.  She is not a passive character who exists only as a victim of her evil stepmother that must be rescued by Prince Charming.  Snow fights her way through the film, teaches the dwarves more than one lesson, and even rescues the Prince on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The other main strength I found in the movie is the fantastic scenery, costumes, and makeup.  I would not be surprised if the wardrobe and makeup were up for award nomination -- Julia Roberts wears what appear to be dozens of gowns and dresses.  The sets are broad and beautiful also.<br /><br />On the other hand, the acting is over the top, and the slapstick and other humor, particularly involving the dwarves, can get quite silly at times.  The movie is also predictable in spots, though the twists on the old story keep the tale fresher rather than stale.<br /><br />These complaints aside, most families and groups will enjoy the visual aspects of the movie and the modern take on such a well-known story.
0785814531|5.0|WOW is my opening statement. I purchased this book for its poems and short stories, and could not believe what a beautiful book this really is. It has the COMPLETE works of Egar Allan Poe, every poem, every short story. If you like Egar Allan Poe, then this is the book for you. You will read it over and over again. I recieved mine for such a small price only to find that it was in excellent condition. I hade to write the seller right away to tell him what a great book, what a great deal that I had recieved.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I base so much of my enjoyment of a book on the characters and how they are developed. As much as I want a good story AND well developed characters, I'll forgive story holes if the characters are engaging and hold my attention. These characters did exactly that.<br /><br />Witches, vampires, and other supernatural creatures are always interesting (to me anyway), but the author does an excellent job of introducing them to the reader and providing all of the relevant details (what a witch can and cannot do, how so many of the stereotypes of vampires were established) without simply stating the facts in a list. Bits and pieces are provided throughout the book, but all at a time where they seem appropriate.<br /><br />This is, at its core, a love story, and I found myself cheering, hoping, worrying for these characters over and over again. There is plenty of suspense, danger, and pain (physical and emotional). Diana is a very real person, and has all of the standard emotions that you would expect of a real person, as well as the added enhancements of being a witch. My favorite character, by far though, is Ysabeau. I won't give anything away plot wise, but I just feel that she was one of the most real characters, and the one I felt myself wanting more of throughout the entire book. I particularly enjoyed the interactions she had with the other characters.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down after the first half, and I am biding my time before starting the second book in the trilogy because I loved these characters so much, that going a year without knowing what happens to them in the third book is just unacceptable. I will likely re-read this book again in a few months to pick up on anything I  missed.

I said it before I had a child....and after having a child, I can honestly still say that I will NEVER read this book to my son.  If I had received it as a gift, it would have been given away.  I have friends that love it, but there is just something very wrong about an old woman driving across town and climbing a ladder to get into her adult son's bedroom!  A book can be sweet without all of this nonsense.  CREEPY!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|his app is so and so for me. I don't like having to earn the games with the coins. I thought we would just get the games for free.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This is a great RPG with a feel like the first Final Fantasy. That being said, DO NOT UPDATE this game. I've lost my progress twice now, each time from updating the game. At least this last time I wasn't as far as I was the first time. Not sure if I'll play it this time around.  It took awhile for me to go back the first time after seeing hours of progress lost.
0307946711|4.0|I knew nothing about this book when a friend handed it to me a while back. She said she thought I might love it.  She thought right. What a nice surprise this well crafted, humorous, heartfelt tale was.  Normally a rogue type character like Dexter would irritate me as would Emma's forgiving, awkward stance towards him.  But not here. I read it really fast as I could not wait to see where Em and Dex were heading romantically or otherwise. The characters' emotions, dialog, and chemistry ring true. Refreshingly so. Fine details and wording make you love the fact that you love reading even more. This author is insightful and gets the human condition. Much appreciated. I highly recommend and now look forward to reading his other books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out for 9 days now. I can consider myself quite \\"fit\\" but I was wounded on my 1st day (level 1). Then I started level 2 on the 7th day. I have been on level 2 for 3 days now and I love it!!!<br />My face was completely red when I was done with my work out.<br />This is the easiest way to get fit and toned. I only need 22 minutes (from warm up, work out, cool down).<br />My conclusion, I can exercise daily even if I only have 30 minutes to spare. No more excuses to get fit.<br />I already bought 3 other DVD. In a day or two, I think I will be at Level 3 \\"30 days Shred\\".<br />I am looking forward to the challenges!!
0446672653|5.0|I only wish that the book had a continuation...I wanted to read the whole book in one sitting. On the last chapter refrain myself from reading for two days just because i did not wanted the book to end.<br />I love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think Flow is really fun. I got addicted to it and tried to get stars on all of them. It starts out easy and gets harder as the levels progress. I was so happy when I found out it was free. Even though I would pay for this game. Get ready to stay up late with this one.

You Dear, Sweet People have become very endearing to me. For you've bought back to me things I thought to have since been \\" Lost \\" or \\" Forgotten \\". This book was written by Lee mostly, while bed-ridden of a back injury. Did you know that Bruce could draw??

0439023521|4.0|** spoiler alert **<br />Let me start by saying I started this book expecting to be disappointed. I was pleasantly shocked when I realized I was moving from that expectation to not wanting to stop reading! So, here's why:<br /><br />Firstly, I don't like reading in the first person. There's usually a lot of commentary coming from the voice of the primary character that would not be in a normal person's inner monologue (e.g., \\"I'm so tired I feel like a building has fallen, pinning me to the ground\\" vs \\"I'm so tired I can't even muster the energy to move an inch\\"). Suzanne Collins did not write in the way that irritates me and so now I have to reassess my distaste for 1st person writing -- well done, Ms. Collins!<br /><br />Secondly, I tend to stay away from books intended for young readers because I find they're toned down to be accepted by that audience. The end result is usually a lack of reality/grittiness that would occur if the characters were in a real-world situation. The Hunger Games may be written with words and style that are easily consumed by younger readers, but the world she presents is clearly not intended for children. It's full of palpable danger, pain, and pleasure. Again, I give my kudos to Ms. Collins.<br /><br />Those are writing elements, but let me move on to the characters and different parts of the actual story:<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />* The monologue in Katniss' voice seemed real to me instead of contrived just for the sake of the reader. There are times when she does step outside of the \\"now\\" to relate a previous story, encounter, or similar in full detail that is obviously exposition. Perhaps it happened so seldom that it didn't seem forced. I prefer as little exposition as possible, but stories like how Katniss got the goat, or how her sister wore a hand-me-down until it was rags do have a place. It's a tough balance when writing in 1st person. I still prefer 3rd.<br /><br />* The violence and emotions of the different characters was not toned down. They were in a very deadly situation in the arena and that was effectively delivered. The survival of the non-Careers was questioned from the start, and some of them were dispatched in a rather grizzly manner. This is what I DID NOT expect and what I am glad I received.<br /><br />* There was romance, which I normally despise in a story (book/show/movie) because it seems contrived for the pleasure of those who like that sort of element in a story. In the Hunger Games, the romance aspects were absolutely and completely necessary for the story to unfold as it did. Without Katniss playing up their romance to the Games' audience, they would not have made it out alive.<br /><br />* When Katniss finally realizes she has no concept of the actual passage of time in the arena, that really hits home for me because I also have no sense of time as the book progresses. It was a nice aspect from Kat's perspective that was relatable.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />* Some of the details were sort of silly -- the way the people of the Capitol dress; the bio-engineered creatures that were used as weapons; the love of a boy since age 5. These details, and probably a few more, were unrealistic to me and detracted slightly from my suspension of disbelief. The ideas that \\"people would never want to appear as a joke\\" or \\"there are easier ways to make a weapon that bio-engineering\\" always run through my head when I see that sort of thing in a story.<br /><br />* That Kat could read JUST ABOUT EVERYONE else in the story except Peeta with regards to subtext and body language is slightly absurd. Sure, she had no real experience with what adult love could look like, but they were together long enough for her to get something from him. She was with him as long as Haymitch and she could think inside Haymitch's head. She is a born empath and that is not fully executed.s not toned down.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book wasn't horrible, but I just don't get why all the good/great reviews. I read it. It's a good premise for a story, but I thought it was choppy in parts and that the writing wasn't all that great. It did hold my attention somewhat through most parts, but at the same time I wasn't emotionally invested. It just didn't pull me in, I think because the writing was at times choppy and/or too rushed in certain parts.
B0060URV9M|5.0|Sam and Dean are framed by Leviathans for several crimes and end up wanted by the FBI while Bobby attempts to figure out how to kill Leviathans.  The whole soapy water business was a bit lame, but otherwise a solid episode.  Sam finally finds out about Amy's death at Dean's hands, and as usual walks away from Dean.  Leviathan boss Dick Roman meets with the King of Hell, Crowley, and rejects his offer for a partnership.  Crowley quickly realizes that the Leviathan's are not opposed to eliminating all demons in addition to the humans.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was rivetting.  Lots  of twists along the way.  Great story line.  Every parents nightmare. We read this book  in our book club. The conversations lasted for over 2 hours. Everyone had an opinion.  Nature verses nurture. A must read!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|How in the WORLD is this FREE?!?! I have a medical condition called LVAS which creates tinnitus, and I had the hardest time trying to sleep with it. After getting this app however, I've had no trouble sleeping at all! The noises are very realistic and soothing and the binaural beats are very relaxing as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR TINNITUS, LVAS, OR INSOMNIA SUFFERERS!!!

B0061Q13V2|4.0|I always assumed they had cleaned up gymnastics. After reading Ms. Moceanu's story that is obviously not the case. I can't believe the Karolyi system is still in place. Are we, as a country that desperate for a gold medal. If so it's a shame. I was more upset with their treatment of Dominique than the way Tata treated her (and that isn't saying much) I wish more former olympians would come forward like Ms. Moceano did. It would be nice not to see the Karolyi's in 2016. I have no desire to watch woman's gymnastics after reading this book.<br /><br />The only con I have is that there was too much jumping around from present to past. Other than that a must read.
0765356139|3.0|The problem with this book (and many of Sanderson's books) is that it reads like a study guide. It lectures you on the pros and cons of dictator rule instead of telling you the story of the aftermath of a slave uprising and letting you analyze the political philosophies yourself. The plot has a lot of potential and I almost wish Sanderson would go back and rewrite it. Sanderson's story telling was much better in The Way of Kings.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its so simple to use and even with all the ads there is no lag. Its writing is really clear and you can see more for those kids like me who have trouble with long division. I highly reccomend this app. Thank you Digitalchemy for another job well done. I love this app so much because it is so usefully. Way better than a regular calculator. Love it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|-- A Romantic Book Affairs Review<br /><br />Rating: B ... Heat: Warm<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster or Hot Mess? Either one totally describes the hero and heroine of this tale... And might be slight understatements. Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox are two screwed up kids, either way. And Beautiful Disaster is their story. It will wrap you up in its drama and chaos and utter madness until you are completely consumed by their obsessive romance.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy knows who Travis Maddox is. There isn't a single person, male or female, on campus who hasn't heard of him. His reputation as a fierce underground fighter is almost as well known as his reputation as a ladies man. Travis Maddox--the quintessential love `em and leave `em kind of guy. And when Abby blips on his radar - after he sprays his opponents blood all over her - she couldn't be less pleased (by his attention, not the blood). But Travis isn't what he seems and Abby can't help but want to be around him.<br /><br />Travis realizes that Abby isn't like all of the other girls on campus (ie not falling immediately into bed with him). In fact, she almost seems put off by him. And he can't stop himself from trying to win her over. From trying to find out what she's hiding behind her shield of respectable cardigans. And, after she looses a bet to him, he has the perfect opportunity--she has to become his roommate for a month.<br /><br />Abby and Travis are f'ed up. These two have faults and problems and issues out the ying-yang--too numerous to even attempt to list. Co-dependent? Completely. Fear of commitment? Definitely. Anger issues that make the Hulk look normal? Unequivocally. Watching these two try to make it work is like watching oil try to mix with water--impossible unless you keep shaking them up.<br /><br />And if this weren't fiction, it would be just as frustrating and futile an effort. But this is fiction and there is a HEA. Which, though not the best or most realistic ending I've ever read, was greatly appreciated--otherwise I may have thrown my Kindle across the room. Or, more likely, gently set it down and then thrown something less precious...<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is young love at its worst. Obsessive romance at its most poignant. This book is like literary crack--hard to quit and full of highs and lows. When they're good, you're ecstatic and your belly is full of butterflies. When they're bad, you're pissed and your belly has turned to lead. Be prepared to experience the good and bad as often as a teenager experiences mood swings!<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"Abs? What are you, a workout video?\\" he sneered.<br />\\"Pigeon?\\" I said with the same amount of disdain. \\"An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?\\"<br />\\"You like Pigeon,\\" he said defensively. \\"It's a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick. You're my Pigeon.\\"was greatly appreciated--otherwise I may have thrown my Kindle across the room.

0345535421|3.0|The second book in the Song of Ice and Fire Series, A Clash of Kings picks up where a Game of Thrones leaves off.  Westeros is at war, with 4 kings vying to sit on the iron throne and rule.  The novel uses a similar format to Game of Thrones, moving from narrator to narrator to take the reader across Westeros and through the major action of this sweeping epic.<br /><br />I started out really liking Clash of Kings, for all of the same reasons I enjoyed A Game of Thrones.  I like the characters, I like the detail of the storytelling, and the overall epic story arch is really interesting to me.  However, about three quarters of the way through Clash I had serious readers fatigue.  There just wasn't enough happening to keep me engaged in this epic.  Hopefully the next installment will have faster pacing to keep me more engaged.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app.my sister was talking about it and I looked it up then download its so fun and addicting you should really get it and just beacause other people say its bad dose not mean it is and so what if you don't like that's who you are

0345803485|1.0|Ok, I had hopes for this story and book one was just okay but I kept hoping it would get more exciting.  So I tried book two.  My interst was more into Chrisitian (the Dom) and what made him tick, his thoughts etc.  I was hopeful for book two to be more reveling, instead it was just more of the same old thing over and over and over.  I'm not even talking about the sex, which also became redundant.  I started book 3 just because I had already invested time in book 1 & 2 and I was soooo bored.  It was too drawn out and too repetive and I almost gave up. There were good parts to all 3 books and it probably could have been good as 1 book but 2 was too much and 3 was overkill.  I guess it's about the dollar and I fell right into the trap with all the media about the books etc.  I say don't waste your time or money and I pray they don't make a movie because the books are usually better than a movie and the books were boring!
0143119680|4.0|My daughter recommended this book.  I had seen it before, but just glancing at it and the brief descriptions, it never appealed to me.  I just finished reading my copy.  All I can say is, at last there is a smart book about daemon, witch, and vampire. Very enjoyable.  I feel the witch's fragility is played up a bit too much, as is the vampire's handsomeness.  How many times do you have to stress his appeal? I'm very interested in how the plot all plays out... which, for me, is a sign of a good read!
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|I own this book both in the hard copy and the kindle addition (which I carry with me everyday). As a upcoming makeup artist this is the book that everyone should have, from beginners to students to pros and whoever else that has a passion for makeup. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in makeup.

B008BRC6NS|1.0|This is just a desperate attempt to be relevant again.  I guess she feels being on american idol has given her some fans who will hand over money.  The album is sloppy and lazy.  Each track sounds the same but somehow manages to be worse than the last.  It is just shallow drivel with no soul. How can one possibly stand to listen to this!?  She is a has been, she needs to accept that and just disappear.

I could've watched something else. As a bored mother of a newborn I am mad I wasted my time on this. I hardly get to watch a movie since my daughter was born and when I found one I just wasted it on this. I felt like I will go nuts watching the same scene over and over and over smdh<br /><br />And oh I am using my fiancee's account hence the guys  name ;)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Although this game starts out fairly easy, it quickly becomes more challenging and really makes you think. Keeps those brain cells active.
0811875040|2.0|I received the updated/corrected version of this book. I am a pastry chef and I have never found so many mistakes in a cookbook. I have made a few things out of here and none of them have turned out. It has wasted my time and money. I have many other cookbooks from authors that test their recipes, because they turn out perfect everytime.<br /><br /> The pictures and layout of this cookbook are beautiful and like another reviewer said, if you want it as a picture book for your coffee table, then its perfect. But if you actually want to bake from it...I would choose a different book. Wait until they come out with a version that has been tested.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|What happened to Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Professor Moriarty? They are nowhere to be found in \\"A Game of Shadows\\" - a bad sequel to the 2009 original. Instead of a Holmes adventure, the producers made a James Bond retread set in the Victorian era. The film is a painful shambles: two hours of action-movie clich&eacute;s and cheap laughs minus the suspense, mystery and inventiveness of its predecessor. Only the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law survives intact - undercut by a fraudulently misguided script and Guy Ritchie's helter-skelter direction. The character names should have been changed to prevent Sir Arthur Conan Doyle from spinning in his grave.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great 3rd book to a scintillating trilogy. I loved every minute of this trilogy. I was sad that it ended and left me with no where else to go to get my Grey fix.
B005SCSL56|4.0|I admit that I bought this book originally for two reasons: 1) I am a big fan of Chris Colfer.  2) I love faerie tales, especially re-tellings.<br /><br />Talk about a great combination of two things I really like!  Mr. Colfer created a wonderful world in this book.  Even though it seems primarily aimed at tweens and teens, all ages can enjoy it.<br /><br />I liked how he merged all of the popular faerie tales into one seamless piece.  It's clear that he devoted a lot of time and effort for this, and it has paid off.  I am looking forward to reading the next books in this series!  Thanks, Mr. Colfer, for this wonderful book! :)
B004LROUNG|5.0|When John Grisham writes about lawyers and the law, he is at his best. Right from the start I found this book entrancing and had a hard time stopping.

B000NY12LO|5.0|This was my second Jodi Picoult book.  Her writing is exceptional.  I will be buying many more books written by her.  The NINETEEN MINUTES could have been taken from today's headlines.  I work in an elementary school and bullying is high priority.
B001VLXNLU|3.0|The House of Night books I found hard to get into.  They came recommended, so of course I had to go buy the whole series.  I feel a bit (OK, a LOT) cheated to have paid $10 per book, they were really worth half that.  Or less.<br /><br />The characters were good, the premise was good, but something just didn't click with me.  I think as the books progress, they do get better, and being a sucker, I did have to read them, and I'm sure I'll buy the next one.  But under protest at the high price.<br /><br />I guess I just don't see what the hype is.  Maybe it'd be better if I was under 16?  Who knows.
0756407125|5.0|I was scared when i got the book and saw it was 1000 pages.  Having just finished, I wish it were longer.  The story is incredible, the writing is beautiful and imaginative, and the characters are amazing.  I cannot WAIT for the 3rd installment.  Buy it, read it, and read it again.
B008220AVW|5.0|I took a few weeks to mull over whether this was worth my time, and whether to take my daughter to it.  Katy has a great voice, but some of her songs and lifestyle do not jive with our standards.<br /><br />I bit the bullet and took my daughter, thinking this would be a great \\"teaching\\" moment to show how someone who has made it big, and someone she may look up to.  I was thinking that we could talk about the decisions Katy made in her life, those that were good and those that were poor decisions.<br /><br />Rather than glorify Katy and every decision she made, it appeared to be an honest effort to document her journey.  I learned some positive qualities of her that I was not aware of, and the questionable lyrics were not on center stage in the movie.<br /><br />The music is awesome.  It was a fun movie.  The underlying theme is to be strong and independent, that not fitting in with the crowd is OK.  And that is important because young people face that across the entire spectrum, from not being the \\"popular ones\\" to just trying to fit in with the average joe.<br /><br />I recommend the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|omg flow is amazing because it has 300 levels in all so you basically like never get bored in my free time i just grab my kindle fire and play it omg i loveee itttt!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This kindle fire cover is exactly what I wanted.  I wanted something sturdy enough for when I dropped it, it was protected.  And, I wanted something that also served as a \\"holder\\" so that I can set my kindle on the table in the lunchroom at work and read.  It did both things perfectly.  I am highly satisfied!
B006ISJQBM|5.0|Loved The Rum Diary.The movie was the funniest one I've seen in a in a long time. Took my daughter to see it and we never laughed so hard. Johnny Depp did a great job as Hunter S.

It's probably not to everyone's taste but I loved it.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this daily and for a variety if activities -- to wake up,to get ready for something, to wake up my kids or husband, to start the crock pot, to turn off the sprinklet in my garden... you get the idea! Each alarm you servile is extremely customizeable and easy to activate. I love the feature where the alarm volume starts at a percentage of full volume and then gradually - or quickly - becomes full volume. Also I use the &quot;solve math problems to disable&quot; feature to end the alarm process. Great app!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|My daughter has been waiting for this ever since it was announced. She earned it through good grades and successful work at school. I can tell she is enjoying it. I'm enjoying it too.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Product was received in exxcellent condition and on time.  I have really liked the book as I didn't know much about Steve Jobs but have been throughly enlighted by it.
0671027344|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved all of the hidden messages in the book. And the relativity to how life really is as a teen. It should be read in schools across the nation!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I cannot believe other readers really fall for this book. I have read my fair share of porn in novels but this is ridiculous, it isn't even the descriptiveness of the sex that is offensive, it is the duplicity that is offensive. The author cut and pasted most of the pages and then changed a few words here and there, and I skipped over most of them. The author is also one of the most absolute worse writers I have ever read. Seriously, five key words, blushing or some form of it being three out of the five. This author must have had a darn good publicist because the book is awful. It goes to show how brainwashed society really is. I would like a refund personally. I thought the second book would be better, it got worse. I could not believe the hoopla this author and her book received. Shame on society. The characters were shallow also. Again, seriously, how much sex can one take in a two week time frame? Ms. James you are a needy woman. Can't anyone else see through this garbage? We just made a nobody rich. I hope Ms. James stops writing now.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I can't believe this nauseating heap of crud is rated PG-13.  Granted teens are more sophisticated today than 10-15 years ago, but come on!!! The whole vampire shtick is sanitized by this series and a far cry from the classic Nosferatu, which has been turned into pseudo-romantic pablum for the kiddies. The shape shifters are an interesting twist to all of the nonsense, but the story is muddled and so predictable. And the vacuous expressions of \\"Bella\\" are enough to ask for a refund. The most offensive aspects of this drivel are the gross blood drinking/drenching scenes of the emaciated heroine having the life sucked out of her by an unborn half-vamp fetus and the disgusting Caesarean procedure leaving her wasted cadaver sprawled on the delivery table.  Yuk!  Save your money.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Katy Perry, but I think this was a bad idea on her & marketing's thinking. The CD really isn't worth buying if you already own her original \\"Teenage Dream\\" album, as there are only a few new/remixed songs. You could easily save a lot of money by just buying the new singles/remixes that actually interest you. I personally bought the whole CD so I could have her old & new songs right in my car CD player, but I know many people who prefer MP3's. I sure hope she starts writing a lot more and offers her fans a whole new experience in her next album. (I received the CD with no damage & in perfect playable condition.)
B000067FP8|4.0|Last Saturday I had the pleasure of watching \\"Gremlins 2\\" at the SIFF theater -- followed by Joe Dante himself, talking about his career and answering questions from the audience. Seeing it a second time quite changed my opinion of this film.<br /><br />Contrary to what other reviewers state, the original \\"Gremlins\\" was neither a mild nor a cult hit -- it was a //hit//, period, and Warners badly wanted a sequel. Dante told us he refused, because he saw no point (other than making money). But Warners kept pestering, and he gave in, on one condition... \\"Give me absolute, total control over the film\\", which is virtually unheard-of in Hollywood. Love it or hate it, \\"Gremlins 2\\" is 100% Dante.<br /><br />I loved the first film -- it remains one of the great \\"guilty-pleasure\\" movies -- but I had trouble warming to the second. I couldn't handle the fact that it was self-aware -- it \\"knows\\" that it's a movie, and repeatedly announces it to the audience. It also satirizes the negative reactions to the first film, most notably with Leonard Maltin giving a thumbs-down review of the home-video version, while being mauled by gremlins.<br /><br />This time I was able to get into the proper spirit -- ie, not taking it seriously, on any level. Viewed from that perspective, it's a very funny -- and occasionally inspired -- film.
1609611543|5.0|I have been on the diet for two weeks now and am amazed.  I have lost all my food cravings, and I had major food cravings, I thought about food all the time and when the next time I was going to eat.  I have been on every diet out there.  Last one was medifast, just lost 20 pounds on it and couldn't drop another pound.  I gained back almost 10 pounds and now have those 10 pounds to lose again, then another 10 to hit my goal weight.  I have always been scared every time I get off a diet as I become obsessed with food.  Anyway for the first time in a very long time I feel in control of my eating.  I am not really dieting, not really sticking to everything in the wheat belly diet, I just went wheat free.  I am down 5 pounds in 2 weeks and I wasn't even trying to lose.  Just thought I would give it a try.  I now think I have a fighting chance of hitting my goal weight and maintaining it.<br /><br />I will update this review in another couple weeks.
B00802EYDO|4.0|Well, I hate to complain, but I bought this because it was touted as being a 5.1 surround, 24 bit 192k blue ray (like some of the amazing 2L recordings).  This is being a slow to develop format even though it is the highest res and most amazing format in all of recorded music to date.  But when I first put it on I found that the surround is actually 24 bit 96k and only the stereo is 24 bit, 192k.  I did not know this artist but I ordered it because I wanted to support the format and have some recordings at this resolution in 5.1 surround.<br /><br />When I started listening I was planning to return the disk since it was not as advertised but I have to say that it kept me listening and by the time I finished the album Patricia Barber and company had won me over.  There is a lot to commend in the recording quality and in the music, songs and performances.  I am sure I will listen to much of this album many more times and play it for my audiophile friends so . . . it's a keeper.  Recommended if you like the genre (which I have dubbed, \\"modern beatnik jazz\\")  8-)

1423113497|5.0|This is one of the best series for pre-teens and teens I've read.  I shouldn't even say that it's only for teens because I believe I liked it every bit as much as my girls did.  We'd studied Greek History a few times over the years, and they loved Greek mythology.  However, kids don't have to know anything at all about it to enjoy these books.  That's the great thing about it:  they learn and then they want to know more!<br /><br />Percy is a lovable, down-on-his-luck kid who is seemingly a born loser until a series of bizarre events help him to see how very special he is.  That alone is a great message for kids today then add centaurs and satyrs and Greek gods to the mix and you've got yourself a winner.  This is what this series is: a winner.  I honestly couldn't put it down once I got into it...then I read one after the other until I got to the end.  I've not gotten this involved in a series of books since Lord of the Rings or the Chronicles of Narnia.

B00005JM02|5.0|My 5 star is for the vendor, not the product.  I cannot imagine anyone purchasing Nemo had not seen it yet.  That is why I am writing about what I consider most important, my experience, not the movie.  The DVD had some type of glitch.  In the beginning few seconds, the image froze as if streaming a video from a very slow ISP.  Then when it started back up, there were voices, but they did not correlate with the picture.  I contacted the vendor and got a very pleasant response.  The vendor was apologetic and immediately started the process to refund me.  What more can you ask for?  The vendor did not make it; if I have any gripes about it, I should take it up with Disney.  I guess things could have been a lot different if I had dealt with some of the vendors from hell I have read about.  I would definitely use this vendor again.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke has become one of the most successful Kindle authors in the world.  He's created two popular series with an action hero series (Donovan Creed) and a re-invention of the Western with  the Emmett Love series.  In How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months! he provides practical advice to authors who are writing for eBooks or other self-publishing vehicles.In full disclosure, let me begin by saying that I'm a Kindle author (albeit barely, my book Jobs Over Fifty, the Guide to New Employment for the Experienced Worker, has yet to hit the best sellers list.  But there is still hope).<br />Locke is a savvy marketer and has given a lot of thought to using data and new media to promote his books.  He links blogs, Twitter and email marketing campaigns to drive purchases and build a following.  He used some very clever techniques, particularly in blogs and emails, to link his brands to other more powerful brands.  While one of his examples of linking his message campaign to Joe Paterno and Penn State would not be good idea now, it is an excellent methodology that other authors can emulate.  That is, he invents ways to link his brand to larger, more established brands through venues such as Twitter.  If some of the thousands of Penn State Twitter followers become John Locke followers, and then become John Locke buyers, then his linkage is a success.<br />Mr. Locke is also cleverly pushing his own books in this one.  He mentions his characters, what makes them work, what audiences like, etc.  He is open that he isn't trying to write great fiction, but rather books that draw an audience, in particular a repeat audience.  Therefore he has two profit opportunities with How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!  A good example of his marketing prowess.<br />I've certainly taken some of his recommendations to heart, in particular doing a better job of maintaining a consistent theme among my website, blog and Twitter, as well as making sure to maintain a database of all email addresses when I get a message from a reader.  Writing for Kindle or self-publishing?  This is easily worth the money.addresses when I get a message from a reader.  Writing for Kindle or self-publishing?  This is easily worth the money.
1416972250|5.0|This was the best book in the series. Lots of action and humor and romance balanced perfectly into one book. New characters like \\"Sebastian Verlac\\", Aline Penhallow and Amatis make this book the best. Even if you were skeptical of the series because Clary and Jace are siblings, read this book anyways!!! Because the series was originally a trilogy, this book has a very, very, very exciting/scary/amazing ending that will make you glad Cassie wrote more books. Also check out the Infernal Devices if you loved this series. Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince (and soon Clockwork Princess) are also shadowhunter books that take place in the 1870's and have characters like Magnus Bane, Camille Belcourt, and even the amazing Will Herondale, Jem Carstairs, and Gideon and Gabriel Lightwood.  Also Consul Wayland and Brother Enoch appear in these books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm sorry, but I have to agree with the majority of remarks regarding this series. Too much repetitiveness, both characters are brought forward as childish, immature and weak minded. The reason it's selling is the erotica that's been wrongly advertised as fiction. It's not a book that should be left lying around for adolescents to be able to read, since the pretext is S&M yet demonstrated throughout as mild. I hate the idea of children learning ANYTHING from this book.
0345803485|1.0|First of all, i had to see for myself what all the hype was about. This book is poorly written. For example, the writer will stick a sizeable word in short sentence, really? It just keeps getting worse and more like Twilight the more you read. I am not sure if Stephanie Meyer should feel admired or be hopping mad! The story line is unbelievable, who at 26 is a billionaire (not to mention exact copy of Edward Cullen just not a vampire) and Ana (an exact duplicate of Bella, not knowing she is a beauty, kinda klutzy, etc)....The worst part is I found no romantic story line here, starting with a 15 year old boy who was sexually abused. This is sad and deeply maddening to see how its making millions. A story about a very obsessive young man who never really changes in all three books....

B0054JZC6E|5.0|has a huge variety of games! never gets old comes in handy when I get bored! some games are a little challenging but its worth it:)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First off,  I am 30 years old and I felt like I just read some young girls diary about her man crush. I can not believe all the hype I was hearing about this book. I thought,  oh my gosh....I have to read it. I almost gave up a few times but, I actually finished the first book. Now that I think about it, this book was recommended by my younger single friends. As for me..I don't know. Am I at that age now where I relate to a different crowd?  OMG!<br />The romance: who in the bleep thinks this is romantic or sexy? From his description to those repeated lines, I'm pretty darn proud to be with the 30 and over crowd.<br />To be fair,  maybe this book is meant for younger readers. Or people who have never had sex then this book would have inspired many hopefuls to seek a Mr. Grey with a troubled past to turn them on and give them a ridiculous orgasm at the touch of a hand. REALLY?  It still sounds silly. Maybe Anna doesn't know what an actuall orgasm is. Sounds like she maybe feeling chills. Pretty good chills But,  come on.  I laughed mostly and skipped to the next page. Money not well spent, however; I helped make it a best seller.<br />To everyone who found this book and her others absolutely fantastic...I really don't mean to offend but it is a review and you are reading different opinions. This is my opinion and I'm sticking to it. This book reminds me of The Babysitters Club Gone Wild. Almost shameful of me to have read it. Not because I'm being prissy but its almost like again, I read some young girls diary my mistake.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Shocked at all the bad reviews. This thing has worked perfectly right out of the box, has never once gone dead or lost connection with the computer (and I use the mouse for 8-12 hours a day during the work week).<br /><br />I love the Mobee - I was burning through batteries every couple of weeks, and then switched to rechargeable batteries - but they couldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of days and were constantly dropping the connection to my iMac, making for a super frustrating experience - my iMac was just a giant paperweight because of two crappy AA batteries.<br /><br />To be fair though, as much as I love this product - it shouldn't be necessary. Why Apple chose to make the Magic Mouse without an internal rechargeable battery and standard USB cord that we use on our iPads / iPhones / iPods is absolutely mind-boggling, especially for a company that prides itself on its consistency of design and clever engineering. How did the AA battery design even get green-lighted? Until Apple revamps this thing, I will be totally thankful for my trouble-free Mobee.  Just make sure to set the mouse on the charger before going to bed every night.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This series is absolutely OUTSTANDING. It is a Roman era masterpiece and has just enough historical fact to make it a must watch. The casting is truly great and at times you are not aware that you are watching actors. The character development is gripping and the cast is superb!

It even came a day early.. I don't always like ordering online, but this is the best deal and it's very good delivery.. :) I will be ordering more anime from here :) bc to me unless it's on clearance (like 75-90%) at a store this is the best deal for anime :)))

B005HJMORG|5.0|Gritty, raw, catchy and cool. You don't find music anymore that fires on all cylinders like the Keys do on this CD. It isn't rip-your-face-off-rock, but mines a deeper vein of mojo with a slightly sinister edge. The raw guitars, Pat Carney's stumbling, chunky grooves and Dan Auerbach's soulful wail, make for a deliciously dark and savory stew that bubbles along like a thick urban gumbo.The sonic quality overall is stellar - raw and punchy with nothing to stall the momentum of the songs. Some of the best stuff I've heard in years. If there are any bands/cds out there that compare to Brothers, please let me know - I'd love to hear them.

I love Super Rich Kids, Pilot Jones, Bad Religion, Sweet Life,....I should just say all of it.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Dark Roots Of Earth is the tenth full-length studio album by the legendary San Franciscan Bay Area Thrash Metal band Testament. It was released on Nuclear Blast in the summer of 2012, following up 2008's critically acclaimed The Formation Of Damnation album. Like that album and indeed also its 1999 predecessor, The Gathering, the album was produced by the famous British producer Andy Sneap.<br /><br />There was a bit of background intrigue regarding the album's drummer in as much as that although the excellent and underrated Paul Bostaph was still a member of the band just before the time of the album's writing, due to an injury, the drums on the album where actually played by another former Testament band member (and member or contributor with dozens of respected and influential bands) Gene Hoglan. Consequently the album has quite a different feel, as far as the drumming goes, to The Formation Of Damnation.<br /><br />Interestingly, the band also worked with Lamb Of God's Chris Addler on this record, but his tracks didn't end up on the standard version of the album, although his version of the track `A Day In Death' can be bought separately online.<br /><br />Stylistically speaking, Dark Roots Of Earth very much continues in the path set by the previous two Testament albums, mixing elements of their classic Thrash sound with some elements of their more Death Metal influenced mid period, toned down. The result is an album that has songs with the occasional use of Death-vocals like 1997's Demonic album, sharing song-time with melodic singing and guitar harmonies like 1989's Practice What You Preach album or even perhaps 1992's The Ritual, as well as the somewhat controversial new usage of Blast Beats. This pretty much creates a best-of-both-worlds scenario for fans of the band's entire catalogue.<br /><br />The main body of the album however is made up of speedy double-kicks, chugging low-pitched guitars and mostly shouted vocals, punctuated frequently by Alex Skolnick's and Eric Peterson's creative leads and solos. So, effectively it pretty much embodies the classic Bay Area Thrash sound, but in a way which still comes across as fresh and modern primarily through the excellent production job and the surprising amount of melody in the songwriting.<br /><br />There are also a couple of tracks, including the Title Track and the semi-ballad `Cold Embrace' which try other ideas and styles as well, which adds a touch of variety to the album, breaking up the stream of faster pounding numbers and allowing it to flow well from beginning to end.<br /><br />Highlights include the catchy opener `Rise Up,' the catchy single `True American Hate' and the aforementioned semi-ballad `Cold Embrace.'<br /><br />At the end of the day, its going to be down to personal preference how much you enjoy the album and where it fits in the band's catalogue. Some people will find it a little too modern and some people won't find it light and melodic enough. Some people would prefer if Louie Clemente or Paul Bostaph had been on it and some people just don't like modern production at all. If any of these things sound like how your mind usually works then this might be one to skip but it's definitely a personal-preference issue if you dislike the record rather than any inherent lack of quality.<br /><br />What can't really be argued is that the band have put in a tremendous amount of care and effort into crafting this album and care has been taken to mix old-school and modern styles to keep things fresh. It isn't just formulaic and it isn't just phoned-in and I personally enjoy it a great deal. Due to the album's very high anticipation level and all the excitement surrounding it, I'm not sure at this point if the album will retain all of its potency with the passage of time or how much respect the fans will give it two or three albums down the line, but it certainly leaves an incredibly strong first impression right now and is far, far from a disappointment or let down.<br /><br />Overall; Dark Roots Of Earth is an excellent and enjoyable fifty-minute album. Fans of Testament should check out the album, especially if they already enjoyed the previous album; fans of Thrash should check out the album, especially if they like the excellent renaissance its been enjoying in recent years as classic bands either reform or release their best albums since the eighties and in fact, fans of Metal in general who for some reason haven't yet explored Testament should consider at least checking out this album if they have the time and money to take a shot on it.<br /><br />***If you chose to get the special edition version, you can enjoy four bonus tracks, including an extended version of `Throne Of Thrones,' as well as the Queen cover `Dragon Attack,' the Scorpions cover `Animal Magnetism' and the Iron Maiden cover `Powerslave.'<br /><br />Furthermore, you get a DVD featuring a 29-minute making-of documentary, although the band did give away most of the footage in free webisodes prior to the album's release.<br /><br />There is also a 9-minute `Gear Tour' from the guitarists where they take you through the pick-ups and pedals and that sort of thing.<br /><br />Finally there is a 20-minute live concert from the Avalon Ballroom, Santa Clara California, February 19th 2012.  The track listing is: 1. Practice What You Preach 2. Over The Wall 3. Souls Of Black 4. Disciples Of The Watch.<br /><br />It is a multi-camera shoot and a fairly energetic performance from the band in front of an enthusiastic crowd (they have fun and you even hear the Breaking The Law riff at one point), although the sound quality isn't incredible and the vocals and guitar are fairly low in the mix. Despite these sound problems it is still fairly enjoyable, and watching Skolnick's guitar solos close up should be interesting for guitarists. Basically, it is a nice enough bonus feature but isn't of the same production value as their Live In London DVD.<br /><br />The packaging  of this special edition version is in an elaborate glossy book-style presentation, with the pages stuck into the case's spine and the discs held inside a `page' each.  And overall the whole thing is worth the extra money if the price difference is small enough and you haven't already got a copy of the album***r let down.<br /><br />Overall; Dark Roots Of Earth is an excellent and enjoyable fifty-minute album. Fans of Testament should check out the album, especially if they already enjoyed the previous album; fans of Thrash should check out the album, especially if they like the excellent renaissance its been enjoying in recent years as classic bands either reform or release their best albums since the eighties and in fact, fans of Metal in general who for some reason haven't yet explored Testament should consider at least checking out this album if they have the time and money to take a shot on it.<br /><br />***If you chose to get the special edition version, you can enjoy four bonus tracks, including an extended version of `Throne Of Thrones,' as well as the Queen cover `Dragon Attack,' the Scorpions cover `Animal Magnetism' and the Iron Maiden cover `Powerslave.'<br /><br />Furthermore, you get a DVD featuring a 29-minute making-of documentary, although the band did give away most of the footage in free webisodes prior to the album's release.<br /><br />There is also a 9-minute `Gear Tour' from the guitarists where they take you through the pick-ups and pedals and that sort of thing.<br /><br />Finally there is a 20-minute live concert from the Avalon Ballroom, Santa Clara California, February 19th 2012.  The track listing is: 1. Practice What You Preach 2. Over The Wall 3. Souls Of Black 4.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|I really look forward to the Blu-Ray Release of Burton's Dark Shadows as it sounds like there are nine additional segments to the movie that can be watched individually or as part of an expanded feature film...if I understand correctly. For sure there is a fairly fast, fun paced DARK yet FUNNY movie.<br /><br />To begin with...if you are a traditional vampire purist...you WILL be aggravated that Barnabas never encounters a Crucifix, never disappears on demand or turns into a bat nor is required to sleep in his coffin by day.<br /><br />The Burton \\"take\\" on the Collins family (and employees) yields Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, her brother Roger Collins, her daughter Carolyn, his son David, Dr Julia Hoffman, Willie Loomis, Sarah Johnson and of course Barnabas Collins. \\"Victoria Winters\\" and Angelique Bouchard round out the main cast.<br /><br />The flick is a nice tight jaunt of around 113 minutes and is very well paced. Most of the material seen on the movie trailers are quickly whisked by in the film's first ten to fifteen minutes. The story of the Barnabas' original time period from 1752 thru 1776 is recounted swiftly including his being cursed (for rejecting Angelique) and buried alive by the town's people (for being a monster). Barnabas' parents Joshua and Naomi are shown so briefly that all we remember is Joshua's declaration that \\"family is only the REAL wealth\\" while he builds a formidable fortune (using the wealth he built up in Liverpool) by building the seaport town of Collinsport and transforming it into a great fishery/sea port.<br /><br />Light humor abounds throughout the flick...most of it pertaining to Barnabas trying to `ingest\\" and \\"adjust to\\" this great new age of 1972 after being released from his chained coffin after a construction crew literally bangs into his coffin. Barnabas is released. The construction crew do not live to tell about their discovery as Barnabas' nutrient deprived body demands a quick and furious feast.<br /><br />After an encounter with \\"Mephistopheles\\", \\"Lucifer\\" and the towns people...Barnabas finally makes his way to Collinwood. He is shocked to discover the dilapidated condition that Collinwood is in and immediately seeks out the matriarch for some answers. He makes it clear to the matriarch that he's the original Barnabas Collins cursed for two centuries. She thinks he's an intruder looking for money and blood until he shows her the Family Wealth safely hidden in the lowest secret passages of the mansion. She, then, realizes that Barnabas is the genuine item and she introduces him to the family the next morning at breakfast but keeps his secret intact.<br /><br />Angelique, meanwhile, has spent two centuries being a rival to the Collins family industry and has driven them to almost poverty levels. Angelique subsequently learns of Barnabas being released from his \\"life imprisonment\\" and throws all her witchery to wage war against Barnabas and the Collins family..<br /><br />During the remaining hour and change of the film...we are treated to the fact that the Collins family members as well as the new governess, \\"Victoria Winters\\" each have secrets that are brought to light during the course of the film.<br /><br />Dr Hoffman discovers that Barnabas is a vampire and promises to cure him as Barnabas is soon walking out in the light of day albeit that he appears somewhat like Michael Jackson with an umbrella.<br /><br />In the midst of this drama...Barnabas wants to gain the favor of the townsfolk by throwing a \\"happening\\".  According to Carolyn...the \\"happening\\" needs lots of booze and a superstar singer to \\"rock\\" the town as she suggests Alice Cooper.  Barnabas promises enough booze to fill a schooner and declares \\"she\\", Alice Cooper, will be the guest of the Collins Family.  The Collinsport \\"happening\\" is a success.<br /><br />It's at this point that I would like to comment on the film's soundtrack.  Burton very effectively uses Percy Faith's a theme from \\"A Summer Place\\"...The MoodyBlues \\"Nights in White Satin\\"....The Carpenter's \\"Top Of The World\\" and Alice Cooper's \\"No More Mr Nice Guy\\" and \\"Ballad of Dwight Frye\\".  Other nice selections are included.  Loved the music.<br /><br />As the film drives toward it's climax...Barnabas and the Collins family steadily move toward their final battle with Angelique which contains a surprise or two.<br /><br />I found the ending (unlike most movie reviewers) quite satisfying after Burton throws everything but the kitchen sink into the final conflict. Unlike many reviewers I did not see a strong indication for a sequel. I don't expect one.<br /><br />The cast performed superbly.  Special Kudos to Johnny Depp and Eva Green as Barnabas and Angelique...but they were all superb in my opinion.<br /><br />After all is said and done...I loved Tim Burton's \\"Dark Shadows\\" for being uniquely it's own film not borrowing from the two Dan Curtis films of the 1970s. The visuals do overshadow the script....but we are having so much fun watching all the dysfunctional members of the family fighting for the Collins' true core value that \\"family is the only REAL wealth\\"...that we don't see any reason to criticize the script's shortcomings because it's so darn much fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Okay the first reason to get this book is the authors writing style which I just absolutely loved. She had more clever lines in this book than I've read in a long time. Secondly get it for the plot which is just a gas. This book has more twists and turns than a Twizzler! I like her writing style so much that I have started Dark Places, her first book.
0824835921|5.0|There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said by other reviews. This book does not claim to teach you how to read all the kanji, but it does make recognizing and writing the characters quite simple (which makes it far easier to learn how to read them later).<br /><br />I was an A student throughout three years of college Japanese classes and lived in Japan for over a year afterwards, but  I don't think I really internalized more than 100 kanji in that entire time using traditional methods. I had little motivation to study, because kanji seems insurmountable without a system. A month into RTK, I knew 400 solidly. I took a few months off, but am now nearing 1000. Even if I fall off the study wagon for another few months, I'll know over 2000 before the year is up. That's a pretty incredible feeling for anyone who has tried and failed to learn kanji by other means!<br /><br />I use RTK in conjunction with Anki SRS application on my computer and phone and recommend it highly!

B008BM9L72|4.0|Loved all three books, very easy to read a bit sassy and sexual so if you aren't into that it still has a story line behind it all.

I miss the dual drummers they are a better fit than Tal he is to much glitz style of \\" Metal Drummers \\" and doesn't fit Joe's style. I think Joe tried something to be a little different than his Great Usual Style and it fell short of my satisfaction. But Joe as we Old guys say Keep on Keepin on, Love to hear those Fender's  wail !!
B008133DO8|5.0|The second season lives up to expectations.  I won't say anything to spoil the outcome so you can enjoy it as much as our family did.<br /><br />Good stuff, it would be wonderful if American TV could produce such programming as this instead of the endless stream of trashy, greasy \\"reality\\" shows.  As if our own reality isn't bad enough, we have to put up with stereotypical offal and tripe from our quick-buck low-content system.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a review of Sherlock, though so here it is:  it's more than worth your while.
B005HSL626|1.0|nothing works on it! it blacks out or goes to the kindle home screen. Don't buy this for your kindle!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is slower than the first two.  It is interesting, but no like the first two. I would recommend it only because it is a continuation and to get closure of the Trilogy.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is good and interesting, but not as interesting as book one.  It seems to be slowing down a bit, but I would still recommend it because it is a continuation. I did get a little bored with some parts of it due to the repetition.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and really enjoyed the story. The details of all the men involved in Marcus's narrative and account of the events really formed much my opinion of so much of what I hear about the Navy SEAL's. I think when Patton once said,\\"Make a decision and then do it like hell\\" he would have had the SEAL's in mind if they had existed in his time. Marcus really show's us that it has to be a conscious decision and something you do like hell to persevere and become a SEAL. Great book that goes much beyond the acts of one or a group of individuals and just shows how much we mean to each other. When you are done reading if you don't feel some sort of debt to the people protecting the USA then you must be missing some portions of your brain, the important one where thought originates.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Onto the third book now, waiting for something good to happen. I have actually just skim read the \\"adult\\" scenes from book two onwards, more interested in the story behind what makes Christian Grey the way he is. The relationship between Ana and Christian feels unbelievable and the sexual aspects in the book capture your attention for the first few chapters, but the shock factor wears very thin by the end of book one.<br />I'm three quarters of the way through book three, still waiting for something spectacular! Kept going for the easy reading aspect - two kids under two make heavy going reading out of the question most times.

B0064NTZ6W|5.0|3hr and 27 minute version bought yesterday and watched today.  Too many write plot summaries so I won't.<br /><br />Video transfer:  Really quite excellent in almost all areas.  On a 1-10 scale, I would give it a 9.  Why?  In the opening sequence, before the title comes on, the sub is coming straight at you in a sea of green.  This green had a ton of grain in which made me worry needlessly that the rest of the film would be as bad.  It wasn't.  No real grain anywhere other than the same green underwater shots and a sky shot that came on at about 28 minutes. As a diver with over 3000 dives,  I have been in water that green.  However, since this takes place over a period of time, that each underwater shot would be the same color green is extremely unlikely, if not, beyond belief.  Never the less, the details for all  the interior shots, which is the great majority of the movie, were outstanding.  You can see each face wrinkle, see the details of hair in a beard, the droplets of sweat on the skin.  The video transfer far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Audio:  An 11 out of 10.  It was outstanding in most every way.  The DTSHD MA audio completely utilized the 5.1 surround theater with exceptional directionality and movement.  Towards the end, there is a scene where two men are drinking apple juice.  In this scene, there is a clock ticking very subtly out of the right rear channel.  Brilliant audio mixing and panning with movement between channels.  Good deep bass for your sub woofer to reproduce though, I believe the bass is reproduced deeper in the Blu Ray of the film 'U-571\\".<br /><br />Das Boot is more realistic in many ways over U-571 and the feeling of claustrophobia that one might get in a sub is brilliantly recreated here.  In my view, this is a must have Blu Ray whose audio is the real star in terms of production values.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankshelp as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app flows smoothly. Graphics, although simple, blend nicely for visual appeal. Touch-drag tracking and grid detection works very nicely. Preset puzzles don't take too much time to finish, but then start racing friends in timed mode. I would highly recommend the app to others.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|I loved this movie. It had all the elements of a spy thriller with the necessary intrigue. Highly recommend it. The main actor really comes into his own in this film.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This trilogy was so very redundant when it came to the \\"hot\\" sex scenes that it actually became boring (to say nothing of unrealistic - how many times in one day does one want hot sex and how many times can a man perform in one \\"sitting\\"?).  The story line regarding his issues and his ultimate healing because he found, quite accidentally, a loving relationship was the only thing that kept me purchasing the next book.  Not especially well written and, in my humble opinion, much ado about nothing...  I did enjoy her character \\"asides\\" (those things she was thinking).
0375869026|5.0|This is one of the most touching books I've ever read.  My 12 year old daughter and I have added this book to our favorites list.  It's impossible not to fall in love with Auggie Pullman.  You will be moved and never quite see the world the same.  We need more books like Wonder.  I am truly glad to have found this jewel.
B007X4N0DU|3.0|The music on this record is pretty good. Thankfully, P.O.D. has ditched the lame sound from Angels and Serpents. The lyrics also are great (see Murdered Love, Higher, e.g.) ... in places. In others, e.g. Bad Boy, lyrics just come off weak.<br /><br />My main beef with this album is on I Am - the inclusion of the f-word (who gives a flip if it's garbled?) is just unnecessary. I understand the context and the message they're trying to give, but as Christians, I don't really see where their justification for swearing comes from. I heard an interview with Sonny in which he basically stated that swearing is ok when trying to reach non-Christians, so Christians should get over it. Uh-huh, right. Really Sonny? Not buying that...<br /><br />I should reemphasize though that the music on here is good. I'm really glad they returned to their roots. And while I hope that their hearts are in the right place, I hope they'll make better choices with their language in the future.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought that there would be no way that any book on a tried and true subject would live up to its advertisement but somehow or other this did. It is not that the writing was superb, or that there were fabulous plot twists or even that racy language created the excitement. It was just exciting and entertaining at the same time, and made me read more.

I was not really disapointed beacause honestly I've never had that much love for Paranormal Activity the script is alright and the plot is acuataly better than the first one but sooner or later Paranormal fans will even get bored.

0486446859|5.0|The Golden Age of Illustration (c. 1880-1920, though many of its proponents continued to work well into the '30s) produced many a great name, including Walter Crane, Howard Pyle, Maxfield Parrish, Edmund Dulac, and N. C. Wyeth (all of whom you can find in other Dover volumes).  But Rackham may have been unique among them.  His illustrations mostly look like pen-and-ink filled in with watercolor and are notable for their precise detailing, especially in costumery (such as Brunnhilde in Plate 29 here).  These 86 plates come from 26 book projects, mostly for William Heinemann or Constable & Co. of London, ranging in period from 1905-40 and in subject from [[ASIN:0517171988 Aesop's Fables]] and [[ASIN:B002CZG05U The Wind in the Willows / by Kenneth Grahame ; Illustrations by Arthur Rackham ; Introduction by A. A. Milne]] (for which he portrayed Toad as standing as tall as a woman's chest) through [[ASIN:B00170C7C6 The romance of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, abridged from Malory's Morte d'Arthur by Alfred W Pollard Illustrated by Arthur Rackham]] and [[ASIN:B001JQFYH8 The Ring of the Niblung: The Rhinegold & The Valkyrie]] to [[ASIN:0486483541 Arthur Rackham's Book of Pictures (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)]].  They have a grace and charm--and a complexity--seldom found in the more hurried work of illustrators today, and if you're unfamiliar with Rackham, this would be an excellent (and accessibly priced) book with which to begin getting to know him.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this collection all the way through (and just purchased the 6th installment).  The world created was real enough to be tangible, yet foreign enough to keep you guessing.  The characters were quickly rendered and yet gripping.  I enjoy the narrative jumps between chapters, following different characters and often hopping between locations.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this read was that while I was in the middle of book three a good buddy of mine came into town... I recommended Wool and he immediately smiled and just about yelled YOU HAVE TO READ THE SIXTH ONE!  I was very glad to hear this little ebook had made the rounds and was reaching the right people.<br /><br />Stephenson fans will love this.  Orson Scott Card folks?  Buy it.  Gibson people?  Get a book.<br /><br />Looking forward to starting book six in about 2 minutes...

1469984202|5.0|This book has been on my suggestion list for months now.  The only reason I never read it was because of the title.  Yes, I know that's a stupid reason, but it is what it is.<br /><br />Anyway, you can now add me to the list of 5-star reviews for this book.<br /><br />Without reading all the 1000+ reviews of this book I can't say for certain, but probably anything could I write here has already been said.  I'll leave it simple and say thaat this book drew me in.  It captured me.  It kept me reading.  I could not put it down.  The characters were believable, setup interesting and the storyline was fascinating.  It is a dark book, and probably not for everyone, but I enjoyed this book (collection of books) immensely.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was just an ok book.  I got a little tired of hearing about how heavy the backpack was, and how her toenails were falling off(from illfitting boots). Overall, I would not recommend this book, yes it was brave (or insane) for a woman to try this alone and inexperienced.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It started out slower than I would have liked, but in thinking back its probably ok, because now this epic adventure is over and I can't get it back!  A fantastic read that I kept putting off when looking for a new story to read ... now that I finally have though - WOW!  The reviews are all great from me, fantastic read!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Maybe it wasn't a literary masterpiece, but I still couldn't put it down. First book was both shocking and fascinating and then the second two brought it all together and tied off all the ends. Want to escape from your life for a while? Dive into these books. Lots of fun.

030758836X|3.0|Nick Dunne awakes the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary, unaware that in less than five hours, his life will forever be the plot of a Lifetime movie.  While helping out at the local bar he co-owns with his twin sister, Go, Nick receives a call from a concerned neighbor, who informs Nick that the door to his house is wide-open and suggests Nick come home to investigate.  Following the neighbor's advice, Nick arrives at the scene to see his cat (who never leaves the house) sitting on his front porch and as the neighbor had mentioned, his front door wide open.  Stepping inside, tables are turned over, papers scattered everywhere and his wife, the amazing Amy, gone.<br /><br />Immediately, the police are notified and as they investigate and repeatedly question Nick, he remains unusually calm, odd for someone whose wife is missing.  His choice to conceal secrets and consistently lie, leaves the police and reader suspicious of Nick.<br /><br />The narration switches from Nick to Amy's diary entries, which portray Nick as an abusive and negligent husband and Amy as the concerned, obedient and loving wife.  Nick tells one story of his marriage, while Amy's details an entirely different one.<br />Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" flows like a Dateline episode, uncovering new evidence and suspects; however, its twists and turns seem a little \\"too\\" out there.  It's engaging, with unsuspecting surprises around every corner.  Surprises so crazy and unheard of, that it leaves \\"Gone Girl\\" void of predictability.<br /><br />To delve any further would be to release spoiler after spoiler.  I enjoyed the book; however, the surprises were too exaggerated and dramatic for my personal taste and whereas I prefer \\"open-ended\\" stories, this one did not sit well with me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app! totally addictive! I would highly recommend this app for all of those bored with solitaire. much more challenging then solitaire with clear instructions and increasing levels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time.  I had high hopes after seeing all the great reviews and was pleased that the book was beyond all my expectations. The minute I finished I started reading again. There are so many layers intricately weaved together to tell an amazing story. You are gripped from the beginning. Character development is phenomenal. Hugh knows how to have you feel every character in a very short amount of time. I haven't been so inspired by a book in many years. It makes me want to write essays!  The ones I used to hate writing in high school - and I want to write like 3 of them b/c there are so many different themes you could run with. I love being inspired by books to think beyond myself, to evaluate life and ponder all of its possibilities. Wool does all of this and more. You won't be disappointed. Get it now!  And prepare to be obsessed. :)<br /><br />Be sure to also read First Shift - book 6 in the series, but a prequel to Wool. But read Wool first. I'm hooked on Hugh's writing and look forward to reading all his works - past and upcoming ones alike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Saw the Hunger Games in cinema on first release and was enthralled.  Got this 2nd book just to see what happened next to Katniss.  Easy to read and a good page-turner.  Having seen the movie of the first book it is easier to imagine the concept now.  Can't wait for film version of this - just for the costumes - brilliantly described in Catching Fire
0240815807|5.0|I have to second the other writers' high opinion about this book. Yes, it's a MUST HAVE item in everyone's library. Caution though, IMHO it's not exactly a book for the beginner. Although written in a lighthearted, informal language, even using some American idioms, the book is dense, to say the least. You cannot just do some reading, but MUST sit at your computer or in your studio and try out the many ideas Mike puts forth on virtually every page of the book. Many technical books start out well, only to slacken off later on or be filled with nonessential talk (fluff). Not this one. Everything in this writing is important indeed. For example, the first chapter is already a very thorough treating of monitors. I've read many articles and a few books about mixing, but none have treated monitors to this length. Then, in \\"From Subjective Impressions to Objective Result\\" (Chap. 4)an equally thorough attention is paid to reference CDs and training one's ear for comparing recordings and picking out differences. I don't here intend to tally the chapters, but just to say that not only all the chapters are extremely useful, but that the pace of packing more information into the discourse thickens as you wade yourself through those 15 chapters and appendices.<br /><br />In conclusion, be warned, it's not enough to only \\"read\\" this book. You must do lots of learning, go back and read again, practice some and then read again...a loop whereby you'll reap great benefits. J.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I don't really like minecraft, but I love this game. It has great graphics and is really fun. The best $5 you can spend on a game. If you think of getting the minecraft pocket edition,  think again. This game is the best!
0316056863|5.0|Yes it's generic but I laughed out loud and cried a bit towards the end when she is talking about her daughter. Tina is intelligent and a fine ambassador for the females everywhere! I hope a second book is in the works.
0452289963|4.0|My wife and I have recommended this book to all of our friends and family. It is simply inspiring! Eckhart Tolle reminds us of the endless possibilities we are capable of creating and achieving for ourselves.
B002N14GPE|4.0|I heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I do not think it was terrible.  It was entertaining, parts were frightening, parts were disturbing, and it wasn't one of those movies I felt like wasted my time after watching it.  I had regretfully read the wiki article on this movie before watching it, so I knew roughly what was going to happen before it did.  It would have been a much more entertaining movie if I was watching it knowing no background on the movie or its plot.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, but I wouldn't build it up too much.  Take it for what it is, entertainment!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Oh man I was so excited to get this show! I have been wanting it forever and when i got this product from these guys it was in perfect conditions, I love the box and all the extras that come with it! I would definatly recommend this to anyone!
034580404X|5.0|These books were recommended by a friend. I didn't understand all the hype, so I went to Amazon and read the first two chapters. I was extremely intrigued, so I bought them, and I honestly could not put them down!!!! I think they were the best books I've read ever. I'm looking forward to reading more from E.L.James, and will keep checking up at Amazon to see what is new. Thanks, Sincerely, Ann M. Helzer...
1400052181|3.0|This book was a huge dissappointment. It is the story of Henrietta Lacks, a african american woman who died of cervical cancer in the 1950's. Her doctors used some tissue samples and her cells were the first human cells that scientists were able to duplicate.<br />The premise of the story is that her cells were very important to the scientific community, yet her family did not recieve any money for the cells.<br />This story is more the story of Rebecca Skloot writing the book, than in the family's story. This book lacks focus. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because Rebecca does do a good job of explaining the importance of Henrietta's cells to medical research.<br />Whether or not the family should have profitted is rather moot, since the courts have ruled that for the most part cells cannot be sold by their donor.
B0063IH60K|5.0|loads great, fun for entire family. we all just love this fast running game. keeps even the oldest kids busy for hours.

B000RGGYI4|5.0|First off, just need to mention that this is one of my favourite albums ever - definitely in the top ten! 5 star material, no matter what.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm writing this review to give readers a better understanding of the two versions of this album available for purchase. I accidentally ordered the 2002 remixed version when I meant to order the 2007 Deluxe Edition remaster. So I might as well compare the two versions to give a better understanding to everyone and let everyone decide which version is right for them.<br /><br />First of all, the 2002 release is a remix done by the bassist and lead singer Martin Turner. The 2007 version is a remaster done by... uh... I don't know. Someone else.<br /><br />The track listing differs between the two. The 2002 version has 3 live bonus tracks: Jail Bait, The Pilgrim, and Phoenix. The 2007 deluxe edition has the bonus studio track No Easy Road, and the live bonus tracks The Pilgrim, and Phoenix, as well as a second disc containing 8 additional bonus live tracks. It's worth mentioning that Jail Bait is not included on the 2007 release, however a live rendition of Jail Bait is available on the album Pilgrimage (not sure if this is the same live release of Jail Bait). I believe the bonus tracks on the 2007 release is superior, as I found Jail Bait is a little out of place, and No Easy Road is a bit more appropriate.<br /><br />Both releases sound excellent, however I found the 2002 release to be a bit more 'clear'. The difference is very slight, so slight I feel like I'm imagining it.<br /><br />As for which mix is better, I found the 2007 release's mix to be far superior, and much more faithful to the original. The difference is obvious on The King Will Come - the 2002 release has a shorter intro, and less emphasis on the excellent twin guitars. The 2007 version sounds perfect. Lots of emphasis in just the right places, and lots of depth. The 2002 release sounds more flat.<br /><br />So there you have it! My personal preference is the 2007 Deluxe Edition because of the mix alone. The 2002 remix just sounds like there's something not quite right about it.
B003B0D2QU|5.0|Book arrived quickly and in condition as described. This book was for a summer reading project so a new book was not necessary therefore purchased used copy. Would buy again!
B006QS0PF0|5.0|As a struggling/recovering Anorexic/Bulimic, this book has done SO much for my recovery. I read her autobiography and cried during nearly every chapter. Portia writes beautifully, which is expected since she's brilliant and was accepted into law school. I highlighted something I related to during almost every chapter. She's fantastic, strong, and beautiful. Reviews of this book that say anything otherwise make me sick. She's not searching for attention. She's raising anorexia awareness, which is my number one goal in life. It was so inspiring for me to read a beautifully written book by a celebrity who has struggled the exact same struggles that I have, and I wish everyone would read it. Maybe if more people would, society would understand eating disorders. To this day, most of society doesn't. They think that anorexics are \\"starved for attention,\\" which is basically what many of the reviews have said. I, a normal 21-year-old, am not starved for attention, and neither was Portia. She's a goddess.<br /><br />Sidenote: this is my father's account. My real name is Kaitlin and I am a 21-year-old recovering anorexic.

B008EQIA7W|2.0|This movie was a disappointment. Defineately does not measure up to the first. On the plus side, it had lots of cool special affects. I could not thing of anything else that impressed me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you are into action, and a plot that twists and turns, you won't be able to stop reading Catching Fire.  Each book has a theme, and the plot continues with its ups and ups. from the first book, til the last.  Each book in the trilogy finds its way in the lives of its communities, and as the story goes  you never know what is going to happen next to individuals as the drama holds your attention. You will not be able to put it down.  I think I would much prefer to read these book, rather than  see it in a theatre.  EXCELLENT  I bought the first book, then went to Kindle for much better pricing, and had the books at my fingertips when I needed them Immediately
B008ASLNN2|4.0|I cannot decide if I preferred this movie to the first or not. Both were brilliant and Robert Downey is always outstanding. I'd pay to see it again and am considering buying.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have not finished this series yet.  But I can tell you that it is hard to put down.<br />It is very easy to get caught up in the characters and their lives.  I love the fact that it is set in ancient times and includes a lot of fantasy situations but does not go overboard.  I highly recommend this series to anyone of any age.

0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe all the hype around a book, and I'm using the word \\"book\\" loosely, that is written more like the text messaging of a college student, and I do not intend to offend any college students.  It is ironic that James actually uses text messaging to move the story line along.  Poorly written, poorly edited and that a publishing house printed it is beyond me.  I believe this started as a story on a blog, it should have stayed there.  Repetition is used through out the book, so once you've read things like \\"biting your bottom lip\\", \\"rolling your eyes\\", \\"the way his pants sits on his hips\\", \\"sexy\\", \\"hot\\"......(I could go on and on) you will read them over and over.  Save your time and your money and find something else to read, please!!!!!

B002SRQ214|5.0|I have run the Pentiums and have had a dual core AMD 6000 for some years now: this one is excellent, and works exactly as promised.<br />I honestly do not see where a doubling of power used to get the 6 or 8 core will be of any perceivable value to almost anyone.....<br />Not to mention that in getting all these high core numbers, you gain so little, and pay such a high price in both money spent for it, and the power consumption that you must disapate the heat over..... just not worth it except to the few SERIOUS gamers or graphic artists type of folks out there.<br />This has a modest power consumption as 142 watts, so it is not too hard to cool at all, and runs great in my new ASUS mobo!<br />You should have a well ventilated case with supplemental fans.... and if you use the AMD cool and Quiet Software, you can regulate your fans automatically to meet the need.... !  It works perfectly and I have only EVER had the best customer service out of AMD - try getting that with Intel!...or Micro Soft!  Yeh, like that would ever happen!  AMD is possibly the BEST all around gaming and graphics CPU I have every used.... VERY GOOD for the money spent.  You may find better and argue over Intel.... no problem there at all.... but for the money says a lot.<br />Enjoy, Gary (Dee's Geek)
0446572993|4.0|This was just an all around good read. It's not \\"Great Literature\\", put is kept me interested all the way along, wondering how they were going to get out of the major predicament they were all in!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I couldnt believe how long it took to become fairly interesting, about 1/2 the book, and even then was just ok. I wish we could get refunds on Kindle books.

B00846REIS|5.0|I read \\"Bared to You\\" a couple of weeks ago, and have been intending to leave a review ever since.  I have actually gone back and read parts of the book several times.  I was totally caught up in this book, and I felt the story deeply.  It was like I was not just a bystander, but that I could actually *feel* the emotions from this novel.  I love the way that Gideon responds to Eva;  He's so base and emotional when he talks talks to her.  I loved that he was so possessive, and that she was woman enough to demand the same from him.  I usually like books where the heroine is a virgin, but I totally understand the baggage that Eva carried from her past.  I was glad that Gideon was able to admit to himself how much he needed Eva, and how quickly he committed to her without all the \\"this is just physical\\" junk.  The sex scenes were HOT, and full of emotion.  IMHO, I rate this book right up there with 50 Shades, if not a point ot two better.  I cannot wait until the 2nd book, \\"Reflections of You\\" comes out.  This book would make an awesome movie.  I hope someone picks it up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|can be quite challenging with four suite but pleasant and relaxing with one or two.  try it you'll like it.

0425263908|5.0|Bared to you is one of the best books I have read in a long time. You wont be able to put it down. I am looking forward to the sequel. The author makes you connect with the characters.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Unlikeable characters, unless they feel very very real to me, don't keep me turning pages. I hated this book. I hated it because I'd expected to love it, because I'd expected some dark murder mystery that would have been grounded in some kinda reality. I could like neither husband, wife, or the silly twin called Go, whose name I read as a verb every time, which made me have to re-read sentences to get the context. I hated the twist around half way through the book. It felt like a bad B movie. Is it skillfully written? I guess. Ok. I'll give it that. She can plot and structure a book. 'Nuff said.
068484267X|4.0|the product is pretty good as the description, well, it looks pretty new as well... I like this book, but still reading it, the shipping is fast as well.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci can be a bit up and down.  But this one is a good summer read, bought it to take a break from serious reading and found myself limiting myself so that the tale would last a bit longer.  The temptation to plow through it was significant, great plot, good character formation, well written.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I'm pretty new to the Kindle Fire (4 weeks now), but I am catching up.  I am up to 10 videos on my Fire.  I just watched The Dark Knight once again, but this time on my Kindle Fire.  Whoa!  It brought back some good memories.  What a great movie and what great acting from all involved.  I saw The Dark Knight Rising on the opening midnight show (in Oklahoma) and I am planning on seeing it again tonight.  I am now even more in the mood.  The Kindle Fire is perfect for watching videos.  I picked up the Dark Knight when it came on sale for only $4.99.  I can't remember if Batman Begains was on sale at the time or not.  If so, I should have picked it up as well.  I even took my Fire to work and watched about 45 minutes of The Dark Knight during my lunch hour.  I hooked my work PC's speakers to the Fire and rocked out to Batman, Two-Face, and the Joker.  Still using the Volume+ app to boast the sound on the Fire.  If you have a Fire, this would be a good selection to have on-hand.  I watched it once and it is back on the Cloud once again.  Ready for my next viewing!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|love this game but Colors are very limited...don't even have green which is a very basic color...was thinking of getting version you pay for to get more colors  but the reviews on that version said it was the same as the free version...thus I am left with no brown or green...otherwise is a great game...don't think any version should be without green though!

092389165X|3.0|While there are many tragedies in war and innocent civilians are tortured and killed this book attempts to ignore everything except the utter destruction of the atomic bomb.<br />  The Japanese attacked the US at pearl harbor without a declaration of war. The war had been raging for 4 years. Americans were getting telegrams daily about family members killed in action.<br />  The battle for Okinawa had just been fought and there were very heavy casualties on both sides. The Japanese had declared ALL civilians were to be part of the war effort and there would be no surrender. The plans for the invasion of the Japanese mainland were underway and it was estimated that at least 1 mil americans and 4 mil japanese would be killed and wounded.<br />  The devastation of the bomb on Hiroshima was devastating. But the war lords refused to surrender despite the devastation.<br />  It was necessary to drop a second bomb on Nagasaki and even then the warlords refused to surrender. The Emperor then stepped in and declared that Japan would surrender.<br />  The book documents the effects of the bomb and the devastation well but gives a false sense of the absolute necessity of dropping the bomb to bring this horrible war to a conclusion.<br />  Remember almost every home had a  family member or more in the military. People were tired of the war and wanted it over. The bomb was a blessing for both sides. The war was at last over. It is a good description of the horrors of the bomb, but doesn't put the dropping of it into context.
0345803485|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was a slow start, but around 50% it started to get more interesting.  As I was reading it, I thought please do not tell me this guy is a vampire. I enjoyed Twilight, but I was not trying to read a similar story.  I wasnt really expecting him to be into domination, that was an interesting surprise.  I have never read soft porn before but I am pleased with the story line.  I purchased the 2nd book because I want to know why she cannot touch him, aside from the obvious I am hoping that there is a surprising twist.<br /><br />My advice is buy the book if your interested and make up your own mind on how you feel about it.
031603438X|3.0|I found parts of this book to be delightful and other sections had me close to abandoning it.  There beginning part about his backstory and the formation of the Stones was very good, but it felt like that was the proverbial first album and the rest of the book was the rest of the discography (there is an idea in the music realm that the first album of any band tends to be far superior because the bands spends years making it from their best material and it's much harder to make another album of similar quality in a year or two afterward).<br /><br />Some of the crazy stories of drugs, busts and backstabbing are extremely compelling, but there were also pages and pages of relatively mundane events that most readers I suspect will have little interest in.<br /><br />I think it's worth a read even for people like myself who aren't huge Rolling Stones fans, but expect some frustration.

B0002KQNL8|5.0|I saw this movie years ago so when I came across it again on Amazon I decided to buy it. BUYERS BEWARE!!!! Do not buy from a seller on Amazon called \\"M&M ENTERTAINMENT\\" This seller is a total fraud, she takes everybody money and claim her fiance stole it and she can't send you your order because she has no money to ship, she also tells you your order is delay because she just started her business on Amazon but had shipped your order already and you should be getting it soon. It's all a scam people. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER, EVER!!! My mistake was I didn't check her feedbacks before I puchased this movie, had I-- I never would have order from M&M Entertainment. I hope Amazon delete this seller account before she steals somebody else's money.<br /><br />I ordered this movie Return of the living dead part 2 because I have part one and like them both. Order it on July 7th from M&M Entertainment and for 4 days it's been saying shipping soon. contacted seller \\"M&M Entertainment\\" on the 10th to find out why and got a reply my order was delay b/c of backup orders and no money to ship--but that mine was ship out on the 10th. Last EDD was the 30th I contacted seller again and she claimed her fiance stole her money, however she already shipped my order out on the 30th and she gave me her cellphone number to call her which I refused to do. I contacted Amazon instead. I no longer believe this seller, saw her feedbacks and saw that others had the same problem with this seller! Over 65 complaints in 30 days? Good Lord! People you gotta check those FEEDBACKS! Lesson learn.<br /><br />Other then that, I thought Return of the living dead was a good movie, them zombies cracks us up. LOL kept us laughing... Send more brains!!!ROTFL I will be ordering it again from a seller I am familiar with and had dealth with in the past with good experiences. Shame on you M&M Entertainment, shame!!!

0143034901|5.0|I don't know how I missed reading this one when it originally came out. Apparently my husband or I heard something because upon inspecting my bookshelves, I found the paperback. I very rarely run across books that are like love letters to book lovers & voracious readers but I quite enjoy them. This may be one of the best of those I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I kept putting it down because I wanted to think about what I'd read & didn't want it to end. I dreamt about this story as I slept. I laughed out loud to certain passages, yelled at characters when they did things I knew were ill-fated & followed my husband around to read him excerpts. Halfway through, I went & ordered the prequel to this book The Angel's Game & have every intention of reading the sequel to this one. Suffice it to say, this book inhabited me on some deeper level than those I rip through on a regular basis.<br /><br />The characters are wonderfully crafted & I will miss them. Often I was as surprised as Daniel by the turn of events & the mystery of Julian Carax couldn't unravel fast enough for me. I would have found it tedious if not for the fact that I was so enjoying the slow reveal & travelling with the characters as we went along. I won't give away any important plot points because it's something you have to experience for yourself but know this, it is worth the read.
B008MEM24S|2.0|I am 13 and I got this game for my brother and I played it once I think its a dumb game
0062206281|4.0|When I read The Shadow of the Wind years ago, I considered it a stand-alone novel. It was a magical story, beautifully written with a fantastic setting and wonderful, memorable characters. Plus, it introduced me to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books which was, to me, such a wonderful invention.  Imagine a large library of forgotten titles, all lovingly preserved...never to disappear from existence. Sigh.<br /><br />Several years later, Zafon came out with The Angel's Game which was, at the time, advertised as a prequel to Shadow but the author has said numerous times, that all of the books are stand-alone novels and not meant to be read in any particular order and in the case of Angel, I'd say that fits.  However, The Prisoner of Heaven is a follow-up to Shadow in that our main character is now all grown up, married and a father.  But once again, although we get to know a little more about these wonderful characters, it has its own story to tell.<br /><br />Daniel and his father continue to run their bookshop, but times are tough and the business has not been doing well. One day, a stranger walks in and buys a very expensive copy of The Count of Monte Cristo, signs it and tells Daniel to give it to his old friend, Fermin Romero del Torres. When Daniel opens the book, he sees that the inscription that the stranger left, is signed Fermin Romero del Torres which is the same name as Daniel's long time friend. When Daniel shows the book to Fermin, the man has no choice but to share his secret with Daniel and in doing so, is forced to remember a different time, when his days were spent behind bars with a mysterious prisoner by his side.<br /><br />The book is short so I don't want to tell you too much about plot because if I do, you won't read it. What I can tell you is that it isn't as enthralling as Shadow but it was a solid installment to the series. I enjoyed it much more than Angel. My only quibble was the obvious lead-in to a fourth installment at the end. I knew from reading some other reviews that a fourth book is coming, but I didn't expect the lead-in to be so obvious. That was really the only thing that stuck out for me.<br /><br />If you could only read one book, I'd highly recommend Shadow but if you end up falling in love with the characters then you'll be like me and read all of them just because they are all tied together in some way. This is one series where the setting has you coming back for more, too. Barcelona. Old streets. Gothic structures. Mysterious, sinister characters. Yep, quite enjoyable.reading some other reviews that a fourth book is coming, but I didn't expect the lead-in to be so obvious.

B008N1V11U|5.0|This has gotten me playing for days! The game has been awesome, excuse a few tiny glitches. These glitches may include: jerking around, freezing up,  and shutting off at random times. The good thing is if your game shuts you off, you can just turn it right back on and keep playing where you left off. Also, once you are done with the game, you can do free play and do small missions, restart the game, or replay a single mission.  This game is a must have!
B004CURZFC|3.0|The film was alright. The names of the owls were kind of confusing. The film was a little boring at the beginning, but it got better towards the end. A straightforward, not too complicated, decent adventure. I enjoyed learning about the storyline.

B0006J28BO|4.0|Another wonderful, enjoyable movie from Studio Ghibli. The tale was charming, light-hearted, entertaining, and enjoyable. It made me feel carefree and it was fun. I recommend for children as well as adults.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|i doubted on buying this product for almost a year, but once i decided to give it a try, its amazing, when it DOES take a LOT of time to get used to it, once you do, youll be using it for almost anything you can imagine, i bought mine just for games but im using it even for browsing and stuff, this thing is very well made and very ergonomic, when i use my normal G15 keyboard i just miss using my G13 because of how comfortable it is.<br /><br />the software is very well built also, very easy to use and has a lot of customizations, macros, scripting.. you name it<br /><br />inconclussion, it does get a lot of time to get used to it (and its software) but when you build up your muscle memory for the keys youll never want to stop using it.
0143119680|5.0|I really enjoyed all the characters.  I love the historical spin and well as the every evolving story line that was amazing.  I loved the connection between Diana and Matthew and how it all tied together that they truly were destined to be together despite everything.  I had to buy the second book as soon as I finish and I know I will be anticipating the final book!!!!! I really loved the way the story unfolds and how it covers so many time periods thru the vampire's stories.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yuk!  What a silly, badly written book.  It is the worst book that I have ever bought.  Finished about 20% and then deleted it from my kindle.  I am not a prude and there are many books with a sexual theme THAT ARE INTERESTING AND HAVE A GOOD STORY to them.  Just not this one!
B00846REIS|3.0|If you like 50 Shades of Grey you will like this book.  It is like the author took 50 and changed a few things about the charaters and wrote the story.  There were way too many similarities between the books.  Don't get me wrong, I did like the book, but I would have liked it to be a little differant.  I am hoping that the next book in the series will be alot differant.

1401233384|2.0|Barry Allen awakens from a nap at police HQ and discovers he is in an alternate reality: his mother is still alive, his powers are gone, the Justice League doesn't exit, and the world is on the brink of destruction due to a war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. If that wasn't bad enough, Barry Allen's memories are starting to adjust to the new time-line and soon he won't even realize the world he's now living in has been altered.<br />If you haven't already figured out which of Flash's enemies is behind his predictament, then I won't spoil it for you. And that is a prime example of why FLASHPOINT fails to deliver. DC's other major events (Crisis on Infinate Earths, Infinate Crisis, Blackest Night) were Epic, far encompassing storylines that interwove ALL major superheroes. FLASHPOINT comes across as just another Flash story but with boring characters and a predictable resolution.<br />Most surprising to me as I finished reading this was that FLASHPOINT was Thee story that would serve as the set-up to the New 52. How exactly the ENTIRE DCU reboots is unexplained (unlike in Infinate Crisis or the first Crisis). I think Geoff Johns really over-reached here.<br />Thanks for reading!

B004EPYZSK|4.0|Cowboys and Aliens brings out an original concept and although is based on the comic book/graphic novel of the same name, is nearly a complete story in and of itself.<br /><br />The film starts out as a standard cowboy film; drunk, irresponsible son of a cattle baron screwing around with the locals since he feels his dad's name will protect him.  Part of the gang includes an American Indian whose later history is revealed and is quite touching.  But I am getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />It's night and just when you think you are going to watch another Western drama, the aliens come.  Their ships are sleek and fast.  They whip out these hooks and kidnap people off their horses, the street, stores, etc.  You really feel the passion, the fear and excitement as they come zooming in!<br /><br />Of course 19th century peoples have little concept of these so they are dumbstruck.  The plot rolls on like this, with an amnesiac cowboy and a strange weapon on his wrist; a cattle baron who has second thoughts about absolute power; and a woman from a strange planet, herself a victim of the alien hordes upon her own world.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is great as the crotchety old cattle baron, whose backstory is filled with tales of how to be a man and how his sympathy for those less powerful than himself changes the viewer's opinion of him.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Jake the amnesiac; barely escaped from the last alien culling, can't remember it and only knows that he must ride on.  But can he?<br /><br />And the third person, the woman from another world in human form who wants to help these 19th century men and women to avoid the fate that her world suffered from.  Great acting!<br /><br />Best Scene:  When the Cowboys & Indians fight the fast-moving aliens, it's really a site to behold.  Guns, arrows and laser explosions for a good 15 minutes of fanboy overload.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  The film plods along at times, and a plot hole or two prevent this one from making it five stars.  Still, loved the action, you care about the characters and really sympathize with Jake, a man out of his league but adapts to what is really needed of him.  The Spielberg touch with the turtle-like aliens, their delicate hands and fierce demeanor, really put in some frightful appearances.<br /><br />The DVD's special features including several Making Of's, how the aliens were formed, the creation of the aliens, some exclusive interviews with director Favereau, Spielberg and a few of the main actors.  Great product.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />The cast includes:<br />* Daniel Craig as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw<br />* Harrison Ford as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, a powerful cattleman<br />* Olivia Wilde as Ella Swenson, a mysterious traveler who aides Lonergan<br />* Sam Rockwell as Doc, owner of the town's saloon<br />* Paul Dano as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's trouble-making son<br />* Clancy Brown as Meacham, Absolution's preacher and doctor<br />* Keith Carradine as Sheriff John Taggart, Absolution's sheriff<br />* Noah Ringer as Emmett Taggart, John Taggart's grandsonfive stars.

B005LAII08|4.0|Since seeing the trailer a few months ago I've wanted to see Brave.  In fact, I wanted to see it before The Dark Knight and I am glad I did!<br /><br />There are other plot synopses around the `net, so these are just some of my impressions.  -Brave stars Merida, a royal tomboy who wants nothing more than to shoot her arrows and have a great time.  Her mother, the queen, wants her daughter to be proper and married, so as to carry on tradition.<br /><br />The mother/daughter dynamic is very strong in this tale.  Disney/Pixar break tradition a bit and have the princess as an independent girl in a land of tough Scottish brogue and Clan jealousies and pride.  Merida is proud too.  Perhaps too proud.  Her mother is proud as well and demands her girl to be traditional.<br /><br />The tension grows as Merida becomes a fierce teenager, not realizing she's also coming of age.  To change her mother, she follows the willow wisps and meets a woodcarver (actually a witch!) and does the whole spell/magic thing that only Disney can do.<br /><br />The film is darker than other Pixar films and has more of a Disney feel than did Cars or Up or Wall-E, all excellent films in their own right.<br /><br />Not to reveal too much, but Merida's mother has a major change in view which most of the movie revolves around.  The humor is pretty good, especially amongst the clans - the young men who vie for Merida's hand are less than amazing and she out-shoots them all in an archery contest.  Very funny.<br /><br />Animation:<br /><br />The animation has improved greatly from earlier Pixar.  The fiery red hair of the leading lady almost has a mind of its own.  The fierce bear fights, the frightened horse Angus and the Stonehenge-like Celtic legends and magic create an awesome tapestry.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though tedious in length, the mother/daughter tensions, the magical elements and the message of making your own Fate, that destiny is inside you, was inspiring, funny and though missing adult-themed messages (as in Up or Wall-E) was fun to watch.  Mothers should bring their daughters (and vice versa) to see this film.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Voice cast<br />* Kelly Macdonald as Princess Merida<br />* Billy Connolly as King Fergus<br />* Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor<br />* Julie Walters as The Witchsing adult-themed messages (as in Up or Wall-E) was fun to watch.

030758836X|1.0|Despite it's sales success, this is essentially a shaggy dog story -- there's lots of talk and in the end not much has happened (or what has happened is contrary to what has been motivated by the plot). This novel also has two of the least admirable \\"heroes\\" you may encounter this year. After about 50 pages you don't much care what happens to either one of them. If you like to hear amazingly self-centered people whine for about two-hundred-plus pages, this is a novel for you. Otherwise, reader beware: Skip this one.

0307959856|3.0|I wouldn't say I hated this book, but I didn't feel like it had a compelling storyline.  I love Jane Austen and shamefully try to read any knock off I can find because I've read the originals too many times.  This story is fairly true to the characters of Pride and Prejudice, but just doesn't move or make you want to keep reading.  I felt like the \\"mystery\\" was repeated periodically throughout the book in a variety of different locations and closed with a \\"twist\\" that was admittedly not predictable, but also not something you could have figured out based on the information provided in earlier chapters.  It's fine if you are looking for something to read (which I was), but not something that I will be reading again and again.
B006PTL1GC|5.0|I am a big fan of David Cronenberg from his early horrors and cyberpunk films.<br />Only recently I started to study psychology and a must stop for me was a A Dangerous Method, a film based on a nonfiction book of John Kerr, \\"A Most Dangerous Method\\".<br />The film is spellbinding, the three lead actors are amazing and the story is extremely well told and gripping.<br />As I said, studying psychology help to see hidden layers in the dialog about the main character views in life and the method of Freud and Jung such as their views on sex, death and nations.<br />Even without that extra level of knowledge the film is a great example of the masterful directing skills of Cronenberg and the acting skills of Mortensen, Fassbender and Knightley.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I was prepared for the worst - Fifty Shades of Menopause, smutty Mills & Boon novel were my initial thoughts but I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.  Raunchy, yes.  Explicit, yes.  Unbelievable, yes - but a surprisingly good read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I was surprised when this movie came out.  I had heard they were making it before its release, but when it came time for the trailers and advertising I hardly saw anything.  I didn't even know the movie was out in theaters until I went for something else and saw it was playing.  Then when I tried to find a theater playing the movie a few weeks later it was GONE!  So I was dumbfounded.  I wanted to see this movie, but I had no idea it had even been released yet.  But don't buy the negative hype, this move is a really special one.<br /><br />John Carter is an epic sci-fi adventure, much like Star Wars, and as such it doesn't treat its subject matter like most man-out-of-place movies.  In John Carter, the planet Mars (Barsoom in its native tongue) is very much alive and embroiled in conflict.  Our story starts with a civil war veteran, the titular John Carter, just trying to strike it rich in the desert.  One thing leads to another and he's stranded on Mars battling aliens and saving princesses.  The film is a much more romantic (in the literary sense) adventure story, than say the movie \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\".  It takes the viewer by the hand and leads them through a world much different than our own and it takes it seriously.<br /><br />There is violence, there is drama, there is sword-play, what's not to like?

0805086846|4.0|This chronology of how the West (and East) was won, or, more precisely, stolen, from the  Native Americans is not for the faint of heart. The author provides a graphic blow by blow, tribe by tribe account of the deceitful tactics that the American government employed repeatedly to force the Indians to give up land to the government. The technique went something like this: convince the chief of [name of tribe] that if he agrees to the government's conditions, his people will be given food, shelter, protection and land on which to live in peace. Soon, the Government realizes the value of said land and so insists on additional, often one-sided, negotiations in which they offer money, livestock, or some other enticement for the Chief's signature on a document that he can not read or does not understand, stating that he agrees to give up more land. Through disease, battles, cold and starvation, the Indians are forced to capitulate over and over again in order to save their tribe, after which they are moved to progressively smaller, less desirable tracts of land. Some Native Americans are coaxed into working for the government as scouts. Eventually, some Americans learn what is really going on and become sympathetic to the plight of the Native Americans, which results in an occasional tribe-specific victory; however, when all is said and done, well, we all know how things turned out. Chief Joseph of the Nez Perc&eacute;s (p 385) may have said it best, \\"You might as well expect the rivers to run backward as that any man who was born a free man would be contented when penned up and denied liberty to go where he pleases...\\"<br /><br />In addition to detailed information about each tribe, the author begins each chapter with a list of relevant historical facts, significant quotes, and an illustration. In fact, the 2009 version includes a significant number of illustrations as well as about 20 mini-stories by various authors on such subjects as: beadwork, buffalo, and Native American or American persons of interest, a Note on the Text and Art (2009) by Andrew Gulliford, Foreward (2007) by Hampton Sides, Preface (2000) and Introduction (1970), both by the author.<br /><br />Best of the book: extreme detail, photographs, and illustrations. Worst, textbook-like style may make for slow going (or avoidance altogether) for us average readers. In summary, excellent content suffers only from a less than ideal writing style. Also good: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond, The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper and Nothing Like it in the World by Stephen E. Ambrose.or American persons of interest, a Note on the Text and Art (2009) by Andrew Gulliford, Foreward (2007) by Hampton Sides, Preface (2000) and Introduction (1970), both by the author.<br /><br />Best of the book: extreme detail, photographs, and illustrations.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I found myself drawn to reading the second book in the Fifty Shades trilogy, simply because I was mildly curious to see what would happen to the characters. In this second in the series, Anastasia, overwhelmed by the sexual tastes and controlling tendencies of Christian Grey, has broken off their relationship. It takes about a nanosecond before they are back together, and through the rest of the book, we see Ana dealing with her new job and sleazy boss and her feelings about Christian's past relationships.<br /><br />Again, poor writing in this sequel, same as I felt about the first book. I skimmed more of this book that of Fifty Shades of Grey, as I found Ana's inner dialogues with herself tedious and dull. Also, I know this is a romance, but I almost want to classify it as fantasy--I find it really hard to fathom that the author expected her readers (most of whom are female, let's face it) to believe that this dark male character would change his sexual proclivities and personality within the span of a few short weeks. Right, that's completely believable! I was rolling my eyes right along with the characters during much of this book. In all likelihood, I will go on to read the third book in the trilogy, though the awful writing may prove too much for me to handle! I would only recommend this to people who really enjoyed the first book and want more of the same.
B003L77G6A|3.0|The Big Bang Theory has lost some of the sweetness of earlier seasons, and I feel the humor is more and more cutting. Seems like the writers should be able to maintain the humor of the show while having the characters evolve. I'm disappointed that the characters have shown no growth over the years. Walowitz is the exception, still obnoxious but admitting he needs Bernadette and only Bernadette. Having said that, there are still fine moments of comedy and my husband loves this show. He. Laughs. At. Every. Single. Season.

As for the book, it is one of the most inspiring reads I have encountered.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I highly recommend reading this book if you're at all interested in Apple, Steve Jobs, or business in general. The book gave a very honest portrayal of Jobs and his personality as well as his business knowledge. It didn't hide his negative characteristics or downplay his great achievements. The book talks about his personal life some, but to me it seemed the main focus is his life as a businessman. I found the interactions and problem solving during important business decision-making very interesting.<br /><br />Also, the length of the book scared me at first as I tend to stop reading books this long about halfway through but this one kept me interested to the very end. If you like business and/or want to start your own, this is a MUST read, but I would recommend it to anyone. 5 STARS!

B000WAEK0E|4.0|To start with, we have the usual problem with reviews for different products being dumped into the same bucket.  So, some of the reviews may not make a lot of sense.  Part of this is a problem with producers reusing titles for different collections.  Part is an Amazon problem.  This review is for the THREE CD set.  The set has 51 tracks, and the price per track is about average for sets.  As far as the music goes, it is a nice collection of his work.  If you just want a single collection with a lot of content, you could go with this.<br /><br />The packaging, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.  The standard for boxed sets was established by the Chuck Berry Chess Box [[ASIN:B000002Q3Z Chuck Berry (Chess Box)]], and similar boxed sets.  The Chuck Berry Set has 71 tracks on 3 CDs and comes in a nice presentation box with a large format (11\\" x 11\\") booklet providing extensive information.  The present pinch penny packaging for Van Morrison is in a cheap guadfold cardboard case containing a discography for the third CD only.  It's an example of producers turning out one more collection of the same old same old to extract more money from his fans.<br /><br />So, perhaps five stars for the music averaged with three stars for the packaging (and that is being generous).
0385737955|1.0|I listened to this as a book from Audible.  I love that I can return books through Audible, because I was very upset to have lost a credit on such a terrible piece of written language.  There are few young adult lit books that are well-written enough for an adult reader.  This isn't one of them. Beyond this, the story is incredibly wordy and really has very little action.  The premise is trite (post apocalyptic society in the hands of teenage heroes) and the writing is even worse.  The narrator on the Audio is okay, but the story is so awful, he didn't have much to work with.  Please if you are an adult reader/listener, consider if you can tolerate a language usage level that is at best written for 5th grade readers.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|What I love most about this film is that it reminds me of the classic Tim Burton films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands and the film he produced, Nightmare Before Christmas. If you miss classic Burton than this film is for you! I saw this not knowing anything about the source material (Dark Shadows soap opera) and didn't know it was based on the old an TV show until after seeing it. I'd say it's like Austin Powers meets the Adams Family with sexy/gothic art direction and wardrobe. Just when you thought Johnny Depp was out of tricks he manages to deliver a fresh performance and give Banabus Collins (main character) a life of his own. This movie was a great summer flick that didn't get the attention it deserved. Recommended!!

0786838655|5.0|As a 23 year old college student, this book had been gathering dust on my shelf since I picked it up off a clearance table some years ago. I recently started reading many books about Greek Mythology and a friend suggested that I try out this series. Being a children's book (and after seeing the movie) I didn't have high hopes but I began to read it anyway.<br /><br />The book centers on Percy Jackson, a sixth grade boy who just can't seem to stay out of trouble. With dyslexia and ADHD, he seems to always get kicked out of schools. The story starts as he is attacked by a monster that poses as his math teacher. After he \\"defeats\\" her with his pen/sword, no one in the school seems to remember the teacher or what happened. Yet, Percy knows better after hearing his best friend, Grover, and his teacher discussing the events later that night.<br />We come to find out that Percy is a halfblood, a demigod and is in danger from monsters that wish to destroy him. The danger of the situation is apparent when on their way to Camp HalfBlood, a monster attacks and takes Percy's mom. However, this just begins the story as Percy meets new friends, discovers his true heritage, and starts a journey of a lifetime, one that could begin or end a war of the gods.<br /><br />Once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down. The plot is unique and the action is so well written that you feel as if you are there. Even though you are reading from the perspective of a 12 year old boy, it doesn't feel like it has a target age. For an adult, the book is short and an easy read. But it would be the perfect book for a family or parent and child to read together or for a avid child reader to read on his own. There are five books in the series, so the length can be a bit intimidating for a child.<br /><br />No matter your age, you will not be disappointed with this book. The Greek mythology is accurate and must have taken a lot of research. Anyone that likes the mythology will love this book. Go ahead and read it, you won't be sorry.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The books just keep getting better and better. I`ve been hooked from the start and I can`t wait for the next book.<br />...Oh and (SPOLIER ALERT(sorta))... Has anyone else figured out that Simon is a daylighter because he drank Jace`s blood. While under normal circumstances, this wouldn`t be very special, it is because Jace has... wait for it... a little longer... ANGEL BLOOD! (GASP) Yes, I am fairly certian that the ANGEL BLOOD! is what did this. And dont say i didn`t warn you. There was a disclaimer before this spolier.

1594744769|4.0|I wasn't too sure when I started listening to this book via borrowed audiobook from the library. But the reader was great and had a variety of voices for the characters. Interesting read and everything just kinda meshed together in a hodpodge of a good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!!! Can't wait for more. It keeps you in suspense wanting to read on. I've read a Romance Novel before and now I'm hooked, at least on this one.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Granted, I never heard of Frank Ocean and am not into this type of music normally.  I like rock and alternative and count Elliott Smith, Sublime and Radiohead among my favorites. Still, this is easy to listen to, interesting arrangements and fun.  Isn't that what music is all about?  I bought this because it was highly recommended to me.  My cousin was right.  It is catchy music.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Reading through these reviews, I'm appalled at the number of people who are complaining at the focus on minor characters and the sheer number of characters.  Didn't y'all read the first four books??  This is Georg R. R. Martin's bread and butter!  And he does it fantastically.
B00899DR40|1.0|My niece was visiting and purchased this without me knowing it....oh, my God.  This is awful music.....no redeeming value, whatsoever.  The lyrics are hackneyed and every song is a bad cliche.<br /><br />I can't begin to say how horrible this album is.  My niece is 10 and one day she will live to regret ever having listened to this....

B006O6F932|4.0|This product seems to be worth my investment in it for my 9 year old Grand-Daughter.  It seems to be quite durable and other than not providing more definitive and clear assembly instructions, we managed to assemble it completely in less than one hour.  It was difficult for me as an adult fairly well grounded in mechanical design and assembly to understand how it was to be assembled.  But not quite so easy for my Grand-Daughter.  Overall I would rate this item as a four out of 5.
0439023513|2.0|Finishing the trilogy of Hunger Games and all I could say it was a huge DISAPPOINTMENT. WTF with the ending? WTF with characters' development? I'm sorry for whoever is Suzan Collin's fan but she did poorly job in the ending of a (not very) excited story.<br />And Katniss, she is such a little immature, selfish brat, too much time spending on thinking about herself, about making up and posing, about thinking how people could let her die so she could be free, about how she f-ing screwed up everything and let other people die for her to gain NOTHING. Even at the end, she still did not grow up, always little girl, alway acted like an angry neurotic traumatized girl, who always needed somebody to show her how to think properly and talk properly. And guess after 2 Hunger Games, all she learned was hunting, trapping and killing, not even a single sign of developing in character.<br />Yeah if saying she is the tool to attract people in the trilogy, in the third one, she, unfortunately, becomes some kind of rusty one.<br />And well if anyone expects a love story in this book, sorry to disappoint you but this girl does not even know what she really wants in her life!<br />.<br />Wasting 50$ and countless time to read something that makes you feel so frustrated is not worth :)
B005ETA5K2|1.0|the product just stopped working, three months in.  plugged it in, no light, no response, nada. Well, it worked perfectly for the first 3 months, so if you're looking for that kind of planned obsolescence, go ahead and buy this product.  Unsatisfactory.
030758836X|2.0|The story keeps your interest but the F word is used way to many times and too many vulgar terms used.  If I'd know this I would not have bought the book.

0470901071|1.0|7th Edition.  As an experienced software engineer interested in moving to network engineering this book was very helpful in laying the groundwork for modern networking using Cisco devices.  Chapters 1 through 8 do an absolutely wonderful job of this.  I was not able to compile this information myself using Cisco documentation or other sources.<br /><br />I found Chapter 9 (EIGRP & OSPF - 57 pages) to be much too long and technically dense.  This chapter should be broken into two chapters that covers exactly one routing protocol - each with its own set of labs and questions.<br /><br />Chapter 16 (Wide Area Networks) is also ridiculously long at 40 pages of dense technical material - covering PPP, Frame Relay, and VPNs.  This chapter should probably be broken up as well into more focused chapters.<br /><br />Some of the explanations to the review questions are without any convincing justification (Chapter 9, Page 500, Question 8 \\"This leaves option D, which must be correct; it doesn't make much sense, but it is the best answer.\\").  I find this just totally lazy and neglectful.  This practice makes a serious reader waste a lot of time wondering why this option is correct.<br /><br />I also feel like this book was rushed to market by the publisher knowing that it contains several errors.  This would explain the \\"go to our website for up-to-the-minute updates\\" notes that you find on some pages, such as Page 428.<br /><br />Sadly, this book does not cover everything you need to pass the CCNA composite exam nor are the practice exams and questions full reflective of what you will find in the exam.  I would recommend purchasing the \\"CCNA 640-802 Official Cert Library\\" by Wendell Odom - which is complete, has twice as many pages, better updated, and is published by the actual vendor of the exam.
0812993292|4.0|Harold Fry is definitely an unlikely hero.  He would also have easily been voted `least likely to go on a spiritual quest'.  This makes him perfect for this story because it's about unlikely thoughts, friendships, marriages, what have you.  Harold's quest begins with a letter from a former co-worker he thinks of fondly.  They've shared a pivotal moment in Harold's life.  He reads the letter soon after he retires from said job and he reads it in front of his continually carping wife, Maureen.<br /><br />Harold doesn't even mean to go on a quest.  He scribbles some benign well wishes on a card to his dying co-worker and sets out to mail it and somewhere along that mini quest his journey becomes epic as he decides to walk to her hospice with a vague belief that she'll HAVE to wait to die until he gets to her.  His steps will heal her.<br /><br />He meets many kind, odd, and not so kind people along the way.  Mostly he gets caught in his head and in his not so perfect past.  He sometimes spins in circles, he has moments of clarity, epiphanies.  Usually he just tries to put one foot in front of the other.  Even this is a challenge when he realizes he's going the wrong direction or in loops.  There is a place in the book where I was afraid things were going to go down an ordinary path.  I felt let down.  Then Joyce showed the reason she teased us with that route.  I loved the humor in \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\".  I loved the spiritual quest even more.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I received this product and it was used including the thumb print on the cd. Since it was already open I hooked it up in a couple of minutes and recorded about a minute. File sounds like original thus the 2 stars, less three stars for used product. I need to remember to not order electronic devices from Amazon. I will update after I dub a few hours...
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I have to say that this has turned out to be one of my favorite games. It's always challenging, works great, and is going to be fun for just about anybody.

B009JZPH32|4.0|Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is an ex-Navy SEAL. He grows some fine pot with his close friend and botanist Ben (Aaron Johnson). They share a girlfriend in Ophelia (Blake Lively) who fills in the plot points with narration and claims just because she is telling the story doesn't mean she will be alive at the end. I found her story telling irritating at times.<br /><br />As fate would have it, the evil Mexican cartel wants to combine businesses. Our guys tell them, they want out, and they can have the whole thing. The Mexicans didn't like that answer. In order to ensure cooperation the cartel kidnaps Ophelia as the guys form a rescue plan. Ben must quickly learn to kill without the aid of any training or a music montage. Our heroes must walk a fine line between disrupting the cartel while working for them.<br /><br />I liked Oliver Stone more when he made his historical films with a &#34;truthiness&#34; aspect to them. Now he thinks he is Tarantino. The film was certainly watchable and made very well. I believe it was beneath Stone to have done the film. The ending I thought was a mess and needed better developing...but at the same time if Tarantino did it, it would be genius. This is a love it or hate it type of film. I will take the middle ground.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, sex, nudity, brief rape, torture.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I apparently haven't gotten far enough into the game to be effected by the lack of update the other reviewers mentioned. The graphics for this game are pretty good and the app runs smoothly. Game play is so slow though. I have having to wait for energy and not being able to play until its regenerated. I know that's so you can beat the whole game in a day but still. Also this game sends A LOT of notifications. So even when I'm not playing the app is running and draining my kindle's battery. :(

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Having seen \\"Phantom\\" four times over the years it was touring, it was and will always be my favorite musical.  I was not overly impressed with the movie, but I purchased this having liked the DVD version of the Broadway finale of \\"Rent\\".  I have to say it exceeded my expectations.  My only complaint, and it's minor, (SPOILER ALERT!!!) is that the chandelier was stationary above the audience, but I will assume that had more to do with the venue than the production.<br /><br />The curtain call with Sarah Brightman and the four actors who had portrayed the Phantom in various productions was another wonderful surprise.

B005DNPKSQ|1.0|This copy was so bad I thought I was watching a old real to real movie. Lines and artifacts throughout. Played other DVD's worked fine. Amazon did refund my purchase, but I wanted a good copy.<br /><br />Not sure if this was a Bootleg DVD or not. Oh and it was a Blue Ray, lol.
B007TR1R22|5.0|I admit that I fully expected this film to be boring. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find it not only engaging, but the first film I have seen about an adulterous affair that I think actually qualified as a love story. Yes, the film is very slow. But I never found it boring. That is largely due to the powerful performances of the three main actors: Weisz, Hiddleston and Beale.  They captivate from the first to the last.<br /><br />The film has an unusual structure that works well for the themes explored.  It opens with Hester about to commit suicide, and recalling via flashback what transpired to get her to this point.  Like true memories, they don't necessarily come in clearly, or in order, and it can be challenging for a viewer to follow at first.  The movie is ostensibly about the affair between Hester and Freddie, but also subtly addresses the mystery of depression to those who have never experienced it, and cannot understand it. Hester's husband loves her; they have money and privilege, yet she is painfully unhappy because they are no more than friends.  Along comes Freddie who, after surviving the Battle of Britain, is living life to the fullest with little thought for tomorrow - and she falls in love for the first time in her life.  But, Freddie is unable to give her everything she needs either.  It would have been easy to make Freddie the \\"villain\\" here, and I am glad the director did not.  Freddie is insensitive and occasionally cruel to Hester.  Yet, he never misled her on who he is, or what he could be for her.  He is as trapped in his life as she in hers.  One scene in the museum shows that she can be cruel to him in turn.  Hester is caught between two men: one she cares for, respects and enjoys as an intellectual companion, and one who gives her the passion and joy she has been missing.  With such a disastrous set-up, I was somewhat amazed that the film ended with a note of hope.<br /><br />The film is beautiful to look at - visually lush and very appropriate to the time period.  And the score fits so perfectly it actually tells the story for long stretches when there is little dialog.  This is not an \\"entertaining\\" film in the traditional sense, and those looking for escapism will probably be disappointed.  Yet, it is a very moving film about love, rebellion, and finding oneself.  I enjoyed it immensely and will watch it again.<br /><br />The extras are also quite good for an indie film.  They include an interview with Weisz, and one with Hiddleston.  But, the two featurettes were the most interesting.  Terence Davies' Master Class, in which he spends about an hour addressing what looks to be an actual class of students, was superb - delving into his motivations, the actual process of how he directs, what he felt about certain scenes, and the actors.  This would be of particular interest to film students, even if the film is not their cup of tea.  The DVD also includes director commentary of the film, but I personally don't like those. Overall, 4.5 stars, and it has encouraged me to look for other films by this director.propriate to the time period.

B007SGM084|3.0|Eh, the books are a fast read and are good to read when you don't want to have to think too much (I decided to try reading them as a break from grad school studies). It kept me intrigued, but I honestly felt like all the sex got a little old and I found myself by book 3 skipping parts when I saw that the story was going nowhere and it was just going to be another page or 2 of sex...once I read the 1st book (which doesn't really \\"end\\") I felt compelled to read the rest of them just to see what ended up happening. Not terrible books, but not super awesome either.

Although it wasn't the most painful thing I have ever read, I would never recommend it to a friend. The writing was terrible and the constant repeating of \\"lip biting...his eyes are so...he touched my sex...he's so hot...blah blah blah etc. etc. etc. drove me crazy.

B0073XV2W2|4.0|I have been reading this for a week.<br />This morning a headline pops up on Wired.com - Killer-Drone Showdown Set as Lockheed Unveils Jet-Powered `Bot.<br /><br />Suarez is almost prophetic.<br /><br />I liked Daemon. Didn't much like Freedom.<br /><br />This book was tense and exciting. It would make a great movie.<br /><br />As said above, drone warfare is all over the news. I could see drone warfare escalating to the point of terrorist attacks. We already have our Nobel-Peace-prize-winning-Prez using drone warfare as a primary means of attack, all on targets that will never be tried in a court of law. And Iran is building drones like crazy.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of a few (small) plot holes. The team jets all over the world, even leaving the scene in Colorado in a plane, yet no one sees them, tracks, or catches them.<br /><br />Overall a great book.

1849163863|5.0|This book was amazing and I literally could not put it down. A friend of mine made me aware of Peter May's books and I downloaded the first two onto my Kindle.<br /><br />What makes this book so outstandingly good?<br /><br />First, the writing style is tense, gripping. We are introduced to the main character, Fin MacLeod, after he just suffered a tragedy in his life. He is forced to return to Lewis, where he came from originally. The brilliance of the book lies in the flashbacks narrated in the first person where the reader gets a deeper insight into Fin's background and childhood. The importance of those flashback grows steadily throughout the book and the culmination is nothing short of breathtaking.<br /><br />For me the book was particularly fascinating as I count many Leodhasaich among my friends and have been to the island several times - I am familiar with a lot of the places. The guga hunt which is an integral part of the story is described in such a wonderful way that you are actually on an Sgeir with the twelve men.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody who likes a well-told story that grips you and does not let you go.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Sharply written with introspective views that almost reveal too much!  The seriously flawed marriage between characters who border on psychopathy, provides a plot that is as interesting for the characters thoughts and motivations as it is for its' meandering story line. The reveal midway through takes your breath away from an otherwise predictable \\"the husband did it\\" story. The degree of self-damage that the main characters reveal may stretch credulity at times, but the intricate interworking of rationales for their behavior illustrate that beneath the surface, even the most normal of us may be badly broken and deeply disturbed.  As interested in how they are perceived as they are in resolving the battle majeure set before them, the characters ricochet from one disaster to another as balls-in-play in a pinball machine. A great read and a unique story!
0345803485|5.0|It's romance and must be read as such. It's also erotica. It warms the reader up.<br /><br />I was hesitant to read it at first because someone told me it was \\"adult Twilight\\" and Twilight is the worst book ever to be published and/or obsessed over. Then an Internet list of dirty smutty books said it was about a man with a fondness for whips and chains, and I became curious. Some idiot said it was about a college girl with an inner goddess that their relationship is based around. Said idiot didn't understand metaphors, so I will clarify that there is no fantastical goddess element in this story. (Hint: Goddess = her lust).<br /><br />What I did find was some quality smut that is pretty softcore for the most part. I imagine the next book will be more BDSM as Christian faces his inner demons and, of course, sexual desires.<br /><br />People trying to read this as a drama or normal fiction are moronic. It is romance. Chill out. If it's romance from the bestseller list, it's going to have a young, gorgeous billionaire that plays the piano and loves wine.
B00377E5SG|5.0|This is a wonderful re-make of the Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  The soundtrack is awesome and the dialog is so entertaining.  Certainly a must see for all those romantics out there.  Many thanks for the prompt delivery and service.

0345803485|2.0|This book has been on the best seller list for how long?  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is the first poorly written book I almost finished.  Young, virgin, college graduate falls for a beautiful, rich, talented but troubled man.  He wants her to be totally submissive to him.  Agree to any sexual activity he has in mind.  Eventually this dominate/submissive relationship moves in to her personal life and she allows it!!!  I don't think so.  I wont be reading the other two. I imagine she drives out his demons and they live happily ever after.  Ugh.  I was curious and now wonder how a book so contrived with no real plot be on the best seller list.........I bet this author is laughing all the way to the bank............ at those of us one/two star givers :)

B0037Z8SLI|4.0|Gawande's other books have been interesting. This one is valuable and it's lessons are relevant to many occupations and industries.<br />He convinced me that in just about any area of human endeavor, a checklist, drawing on other people's experience is very useful. But most of us resist the idea - we don't need it, it 's too formulaic, no two situations are alike, my job cannot be done by following a set of rules.<br />We say such things, although the value of checklists is quite clear. Why? To me the psychology involved, why we resist such a wise idea, is a great mystery.
030758836X|1.0|The book was interesting though a little far-fetched, but it did keep my interest.  But the ending was just horrible.  It's like it ended in mid-sentence and there were too many loose ends.  Won't read any more of her books.

I was questioning the \\"best seller\\" category and then the ride took off again and am I ever glad I stayed the course. What makes this a great read is that the ending is not what you expect but couldn't be more true to life for these two.
B0019IB0II|3.0|Whil I applaud the fact tha the author bounced bac so well after her stroke at the young age of 37, it is a rarity.  She had some advantages most of us do not have.  A huge support system in her mother, most of us do not have mothers any longer when we had out stroke.  She had a connection to the meical community.  The one part I pointed out to my doctors after suffering a stroke 4 months ago athe age of 55.  A stroke patient needs to be kept in a quiet environment.  minimal sensory stimuli.  I know I was a mess an what speaking I could do I begged for a tranquilizer as I though I was going to have another stroke.  Bing a retired nurse  I realize som things are protocol but as a patient you have the right to refuse anything.  When my son flew in from New York 2 days later I had him take me to a Centre for Neuro sciences to rehab immediately, and  I made an advanced directive should I ever have another stroke  DO not brink me to th ER, do not invade me with one needle or tube and keep you mouths shut.  AM I glad I am alive? Yes, I got to see my first grandchild, would I fight for my life again, NO.  I lost my verbal communication skills my independence a good deal of vision and my zest for life.  I cannot believe she waited so long to ge help, She had the forsight to take a shower and call a friend.  SOmething about this is very strange to me.  I remember every detail of hte stroke and pulled the phone off the table and dialed 911 and I could no talk, they came even though I coul not talk.  I reviewd this with a fe neurologists and something just seems a little too fantastical.  The upside is you can will yourself to come back from an AVM, but th chances are slim.  I can work like cray to go back to a semblancce of my past life, but since my genetic history is strong  for multiple massive strokes, Why would I put myself through that again?  MY sons already  know never again.  NO I am not a smoker or obese or a vegetaable.  I am physically fit and take great care of myself.  When cGod calls my number I am going......

B00338QENI|2.0|I had to read this book as part of a college freshmen class. I was initially excited about the ethics and science I was sure Skloot would present bus was disappointed when I realized that the entire thing was more about her own journey to write the book than present the facts in a concise manner. I got more of a conclusion from the after word than I did trim the entire book itself. I know you might be telling yourself I am just being harsh but this book was written in a juvenile style with no clear direction or purpose. Good idea. Extremely disappointing result.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was excited to read Fifty Shades of Grey after hearing about it from so many of my Facebook friends.  However, I couldn't get past the first few chapters.  Boring is an understatement.  I hear there's lots of erotica in later chapters, but considering the characters bored me to death, I'm not interested in their sex lives.<br />Many who have read this book do rave about it, so maybe it's a love it or hate it kind of read.  You know my opinion.  If you buy it, I hope you like it.  :)
B002BAWIWU|5.0|Let it Roll - Songs of George Harrison has everything a fan could want.

If your looking for a cover to cover story of the battle and ultimately the death of Adam Brown, you will be disappointed.  This was a very emotional read and is more the back story leading up to and after Adam was killed.  As a believer, for such a sad story, it was very uplifting.  My hat is of to the Author as well as all of the extended Brown family.  Adam Brown, was indeed a very special man.

0345803485|2.0|The writer does not know how to develop a real character. Which is the most depressing part of this series. She started out so well, but having this man just magically transform from a man never in love to a man willing to do anything for this random girl after such a short period of time. Yes maybe just for a man that was just a Casanova for no reason, but this man had terrible parts of his past that made him this way. You can't just break those kinds of walls with no efforts. That the love for this random woman would break it down with no real efforts is just ridiculous. No wonder housewives are so obsessed with this book, the idea that they could find a rich handsome man that they could \\"fix\\" so easily. It is sick and unrealistic.<br /><br />Another upsetting part of the writing is that the writer starts off on so many good possibilities for side conflicts of characters or situations and then just immediately resolves them, casts them away, it was honestly just depressing and kind of sad to read these books, seeing how she could have made it such a good story but then just kept taking the turn down the \\"all better\\" ally instead of the ones that would have made the characters real.<br /><br />Bottom line, so-so read i got through the first two books and a chapter of the 3rd. But not worth the hype AT ALL, this is not the first erotic romance novel out there ladies, there are many, and MUCH better reading(not to mention better sex scenes), so do some more looking and you will find one much more worth your time then the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.
1401302378|2.0|Rarely have I completely quit on a book, but this was one of them. Less than halfway through it was clear that Anderson's message, which is actually quite good, can be clearly conveyed in under twenty pages, and that the hundreds of additional pages in this book neither provide additional insight nor sufficient entertainment to justify sticking it out to the end.

B006DHASYM|5.0|Movies need to be reviewed with these things in mind. Does the movie have a story? Does it have a plot line? Did the movie keep your interest? Based on the type of movie was it what you expected. Actually, having seen Anna Faris movies I didn't know what to expect, I think she plays stupid well, but I knew she could play a smarter role, she did it. Chris Evans is actually why I had watched this movie. The movie was different from other romantic comedies it dealt with sex and I like the way movies have evolved like \\"Friends with Benefits\\" etc. I liked this movie and will watch it again and again, it was worth the money.
1451627297|2.0|Slow, slow, slow.  Love Stephen King's older writings but this is not even close to being on par with those.  Started out interesting then just repeated itself over and over again.  I kept waiting for something to happen and it did not.  Have to tell you -- I could not finish this book.  Maybe he redeems himself further on.Too bad; I could;t hang in there.  Too many other good books in my library.  I have a difficult time NOT buying new Stephen King books but have been disappointed too often now.
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|I've been a pretty big fan of Testament for many years, maybe not as big as Overkill, Slayer or a band like Machine Head. Yet still i've always respected their sticking to the true form of metal and never conforming. Things really started to pick up after Low with getting rid of Louie Clemente, who in my eyes was probably one of the worst drummers in metal. Sure on great albums like The Legacy and The New Order he held his own, but after that the drums on Practice, Souls, and Ritual just left a really bad boring taste in your mouth. After the long nearly 8 year hiatus of the band i was excited to hear the release of TFOD, a really killer album that harkened back to the days of The Gathering, one of mine and a lot of other metal heads favorites. Well with The Dark Roots Of Earth, Testament have went back old school, literally, and that's good, yet bad in some ways.<br /><br />  The album starts out with The Rise, which is just a basic song about war, \\"I say rise up, you say war, repeat\\" nothing real special on the lyrical or musical side of things. There is plenty of Alex Skolnick going on with the album but Petersons riffs just don't seem to be nearly as addictive as before. Chucks voice does sound amazing, and just like he did on The New Order, ever better perhaps? The only real powerful songs to me on the album are Native Blood, True American Hate, and Last Stand for Independence. Other than that the other songs, well are just there. Not that they are bad, they just don't have that heavy energy Testament have had the last 4 albums prior. I especially missed Chucks huge low toned roar, which is almost totally absent from the record. Genes Hoglan throws in some of his drum stylings with a few blast beats here and there but very little double bass to be found. I think had Bostaph been on board we may have gotten some, and even a fast song, which on this album there isn't one. Not even a fast break.<br /><br />  My other gripe is they only made 9 original songs, and put one on the album twice. Which would be an extended version of Throne Of Thorns. An extended solo at the end being the only difference. Why not just finish with 4 more originals? A dry spell in writing perhaps? Powerslave is the only cover song that is worth a listen, the rest, especially Dragon Attack are just awful. It was announced months back that Testament were going to wait and redo the entire album and not release it till next year. Chuck had stated they didn't feel the album was really what they wanted, or it needed some tweaking, well he was right. And i'm not sure who convinced him to go ahead and release it now, but i think it was a huge mistake on their part. I think minus the 3 covers and extended original, they could have came up with 4 better original songs. Also i think they could have went back and scratched songs like Cold Embrace and Throne Of Thorns and really kept things moving in high gear. So this is what happens when you write material you're only 80% pleased with. You get a mediocre Testament album for 2012 instead of a great one for 2013. If we all live that long that is. :)<br /><br />  So does it suck? Well no, it's ok. Is it catchy, no not really. Can you tell they released it to quickly without really giving the material their full attention? Absolutely.<br /><br />  And it's not an album you'll give several spins, maybe one, two if your lucky.
0062124293|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  New York Times and People magazine led me to believe this would be funny and reminiscent of all that young girls had to go through in growing up.  Well....it is trashy.  Foul language and may too much information about the goings on of a young girl's body.  Do not waste your money, or even worse, your time.  Find something else to read.

0545165067|5.0|The narration of this book was wonderful.  I loved the male and female voices.  Hearing the temperature at the start of each chapter gave the story line quite a bit of tension.  After listening to the wonderful talk by the author, Maggie Stiefvater, at the end about writing the book, I'll admit that it was a tear jerker.  There was such a sense of loss and trying to connect with another human.  More than that, there was a desire to be loved and love.  Does life have a purpose above the basic animal instincts - what makes us special/human?

0307387178|4.0|This book was fast-paced and well-written and the author obviously has a good deal of empathy for the young man, Chris McCandless, who is the focus of the book. Krakauer weaves the tale by alternately following the wanderings of McCandless on his search for meaning in life with tales from other seekers of meaning and adventure in the wilderness. Ultimately, for me at least, the young man's self-centered lifestyle brings the ultimate pain upon those who most cared for and loved him. While a certain amount of adventure seeking and recklessness may be normal for most young men the story of Chris McCandless should serve as a cautionary tale for all.

B007P6VLRS|4.0|I am a Smashing Pumpkins fan.  I have purchased and owned all of their albums from Gish to this one.  This album strikes me more as another Billy Corgan solo album that some record producer decided to package as a Smashing Pumpkins albums for fear that another solo Corgan release wouldn't sell.  The album is beautiful.  No Corgan fan could possibly think otherwise.  It's way better than his previous solo release (which of course I own as well).  I would recommend this album to anyone.  I just wished they had been more honest about what it is.  It's a strong album.  It still would've sold had they labelled it correctly as Billy Corgan's second solo release.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I was on the fence for the longest between this and the Nostromo. Both gamepads felt good in terms of ergonomics. The LCD on the G13 I didn't really care too much, after all, who really looks down on their controller while in a middle of a big battle? It is nice though to see stats and such when one is bored or waiting for something to happen in game.<br /><br />I decided to go with the G13 because of the thumbpad. My main reason for going with a gamepad vs the traditional keyboard is to transfer the movement keys (WASD) to one button so that the rest of my fingers can focus on the other keys. So far I'm glad I made the decision to go with G13. I've been using it for several months now with (Aion, Civilization V: G&K, The Secret World beta, and Guild Wars 2 beta). The G13 is probably the best gaming peripheral investment I ever made. I use the thumbpad for moving around and it's working flawlessly. It only took me about 15minutes to get used to using my thumb to control all the movement. My other four fingers are now free to access abilities quickly. The days of holding down W to run forward and then having to quickly reach for the 2 or 3 keys are over.<br /><br />I can also play for extended periods of time without my wrist/fingers hurting... another plus to the G13.<br /><br />I can have up to 6 profiles for the G13. Each profile contains up to three different key customization setups. During my time with Guild Wars 2 beta, I have three different key configurations: one for playing Warrior, second one for Mesmer, and third for Elementalist. I can switch key setups on the fly by clicking M1, M2 or M3 on the G13. I can also import key setups from other sources such as from another person. In addition, I can change the color of each key setups to practically any solid color I want.... very nice little feature.<br /><br />I tried using the G13 with Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and After Effects, but it was much easier for me to use a normal keyboard. Not that it can't handle editing software, but I use a pen tablet to do my work and the workflow with a normal keyboard seems the better route for me.<br /><br />My only gripe with the G13 is that a few of the keys are a little bit far to reach, particularly the G7 and G14 keys. It's not that big of a deal, but if you have smaller hands, then it can be an issue.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this gamepad to anyone looking for a better setup. You will not be disappointed.ndle editing software, but I use a pen tablet to do my work and the workflow with a normal keyboard seems the better route for me.<br /><br />My only gripe with the G13 is that a few of the keys are a little bit far to reach, particularly the G7 and G14 keys.

B007FH22VQ|5.0|I have listened to Meshuggah since 2001 and their Nothing album which quickly had me digging through their earlier releases, and quickly and easily became to truly appreciate their music as real art.  Now, fast forward a few years and I missed their obZen album and was about to miss Koloss.  However, I came cross amazon's mp3 downloads and I kind of went a little nuts catching up on a few years of missed releases.  However, I will keep this review to this album.<br /><br />For me, the sign of good musicians and ones that make it art are ones that continue to allow their craft to evolve.  Such is Kolos.  It is the evolution of over two decades of their music.  Each track has a unique vibe, all with powerful well crafted lyrics and driving rifts.  \\"Do not look down\\" has a vicious grooving rift that will get even the most anti-metal listeners bobbing their heads along with it, while the meat of the music for the track is still heavy, and still Meshuggah.  \\"Break those bones whose sinews gave it motion\\" is CLASSIC Meshuggah - the lyrics to this track are superb, and the music is quite on the mark.  Of note other tracks \\"Swarm\\", \\"Behind the Sun\\", \\"I am Colossus\\", and \\"The demons name is surveillance\\" all caught my attention immediately.  \\"Demiurge\\" was a track that I did not take to right off the bat, but since has become a staple for me when listening to Meshuggah.<br /><br />I have read reviews for the album claiming its not quite their old stuff, bla bla, if I wanted their 'old' stuff I'd load up Chaosphere or Nothing.  The band has matured over the years and this album reflects just that.  While they still manage to keep their lyrical content fresh, creative, and remain complex; enough to provoke thought to those that are willing to listen.<br /><br />Of course reviewing music is wildly subjective, and there is next to no merit in it. However, I think that if you like/love Meshuggah's work thus far you owe it to them to buy this album and give it a real good listen -I think many if not all fans will be very pleased.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I guess probably all wipes cases have this problem so I just use the wipes as they come sealed in their bag.  When I tried to use this case in the car and diaper bag the wipes dried out in 1 day so it is only good if you use the wipes that day and replace with new ones the next.  Especially in the summer when it is hot if you leave them in the car they are wasted in a day!  Maybe this would work in the winter but not where I live!  I don't see the point just bring the whole wipes bag (I use 7th generation or Honest wipes which are less toxic).  So I think this is a waste of money.

B004WR125O|1.0|Do not waste your money on this product. I'm quite tech savvy and can tell you without a doubt that it is a waste of your money (not to mention your time). Terrible installation instructions, and if you're not familiar with how network protocols work, you'll be banging your head against the wall, I guarantee it. It may work for some people: Your router must be VERY close to the amp or forget it. Mine is less than 20-feet away and the best signal strength I could get was 52% after extensively testing all channels and configurations on my router. If you do buy this be sure to upgrade your amp's firmware. Then use the \\"USB\\" setting on your amp to connect to the router (for me it was easiest to have the router interface open on my computer and enter the device's pin code). Once connected, use the \\"NET\\" setting and \\"dlna\\" to connect to your computer. As others have mentioned, you'll be better off with a different device with higher signal gain. Another drawback is that this device will only play audio files, no video. So, what I've done and it works 100% better, is use my blu-ray player instead. Since most people use these amps for home theaters, you probably have an internet ready blu-ray player, and they will accomplish the same thing as well as stream video. Returned mine for a refund, suggest you find another alternative and don't waste your time on this device.
0345803485|1.0|Look, I get this is a Love/Hate split reagrding this book and series. However, the writing is pedantic, the sex scenes are 9 1/2 weeks with a sledgehammer or a feather (depending on your point of view on the movie), the characters are shallow and self-indulgent (obviously). I'd really recommend reading the 2 books in my title if you want something dark, steamy and well-written. Just my .02 and maybe it's only .01 with inflation. At least, people are reading which is always a good thing. I just wish it was something with a bit more substance.

Some may say, like \\"real life\\" when emotions are involved, but I really hated both of the main characters at the end of this book.  It will make a great movie and maybe, with acting, the audience will become more involved.  I really HATED the ending...very disatisfying with many unanswered questions.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I first bought the stereo version of this holy grale and thought that was enough bur since The Beatles themselfs made their final decisions on how their recordings should sound in released shape (up to The White Album) only after hearing them in mono, I decided to get the mono-box too so I could hear it the way they did.<br /><br />It always puzzled me that The Fab Four never bothered to oversee the stereo mixing and left it to some sound engineer to fix it for better or worse. Or why they didn't THINK stereo when they created their music. Otherwice they where very ambitious and specific on how they wanted their music to appear with a lots of technical, innovative and imaginative manipulations of the sound (backwards guitars, dubbel track voices, distorted horns, loops etc). But when it came to such a fundamental issue as stereo mixing they obviously didn't care. I mean I'm pretty sure themselfs got nice stereo equipments at home enjoying \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" (in living stereo) for instance. John Lennon didn't hear the stereo versions until the red and blue dubbel collections was released in 1973 and was very upset with the less sophisticated outcome.  A little late to react by then.<br /><br />But even the sun got it's spots (the only one?) and that's the reason why, in The Beatles case, I also want the mono versions (generaly I'm a stereo type of guy). Have they handled the stereo mixing as great as they handled their music this box would have been quite superfluous but since they didn't, it's indispensable.

All an all this is a good jazz cd.

1573921394|4.0|In spite of Keynes' caveat in the preface (\\"This book is chiefly addressed to my fellow economists.  I hope that it will be intelligible to others.\\") I owed it to myself to give it a read.  _The General Theory_ is dense reading.  Fortunately, Keynes is clear in his exposition, his positions well articulated.<br /><br />As a non-economist, I was struck by several things.  First was Keynes' demolition of \\"classical\\" economic theory on the means of increasing employment, political economy, and the relationship of supply to demand.  (Think Say, Malthus, and especially Ricardo and Pigou.)  This was totally unexpected, but given the revolutionary nature of his argument, entirely understandable.  Second, I was stuck by the way in which Keynes structures his theory - it was much more reminiscent of philosophy than economics, as the terms Keynes uses are first clearly defined and deliniated before the relationship between ideas (and his postulates on the cause and effect between them) is discussed.  Lastly, I was pleasantly suprised by the wit and cleverness of his writing.<br /><br />That said, I found it difficult reading, primarily because I am not fluent with many of the concepts Keynes discusses (the \\"elaasticity of effective demand\\" as it relates to the Quantity Theory of Money for example).  WIth patience, plenty of revisiting the definitions of economic terms and careful deliberate thought, I was able to follow the gist of Keynes' General Theory.  It made for slow going.  Whether you agree (or not) with Keynes' theories have become as much a political exercise as an economic one, and are waters I'd rather not wade into here.  In terms of the merits of the book, for the lay reader, you really have to want it to wade through it - it may be suprising at how poorly represented Keynes' ideas are represented in the popular imagination (for example, that Keynes supported deficit finance).  That alone an incentive for giving _The General Theory_ a try.
1583334386|5.0|Just about the time you think that there is nothing in self-help books, a number appear applying current neuroscience research to personal development.  Kelly McGonigal, a health psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University, is a thought provoking and helpful addition to this emerging genre.  In The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It, she defines willpower and reveals what we are coming to understand about how it works.  More importantly, she tells readers how current research can be used to advantage.  For example, will power is limited and works best under certain conditions.  Feeling bad causes use to give in to circumstances.  Inner acceptance improves outer control.  Each chapter is complete in itself which is helpful.  This is a very informative helpful little book worth the time and effort to complete it.  Have a pencil at hand to take notes as you turn the pages.
B0050R0XEG|2.0|On another website, I read an experienced Lego builder say he got so frustrated that he threw the roof assembly against the wall.  It wasn't that bad for me, but almost.  This is an ideal Lego set for someone with four hands and a ton of patience.  I've put together many other Lego sets, and this one was the most difficult due to what I consider a poor design resulting for insufficient support to some areas (like the roof, for starters).
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg is a reporter for the New York Times and author of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business.  I picked this volume up out of sheer curiosity and was well rewarded for my reading time.  This is an entertaining and informative book.  The book falls into three major sections.  In the first, Duhigg brings readers up to speed on current research about individual habits.  Wait! Don't let that discourage you from turning some pages in this book.  It is really helpful material.  In the next section, Duhigg applies what we are coming to understand about the development of habits to organizations.  The most helpful chapter in this section concerns how Starbucks has institutionalized habits of success.  In the final section, Habits of Societies, Duhigg describes how the Montgomery Buss Boycott came to be and how the pastor of Saddleback Church came to use habit to build his congregation.  Both chapters are well worth the price of the book.  Readers hoping to know how to break bad habits will not find direct advice.  However, the book outlines how habits are formed and much can be gleaned from that perspective.  I hope that Duhigg will follow this volume with others.  His writing style is very good and his preparation is evident.
0385736002|4.0|I would rate this book 4 1/2 stars, I really enjoyed the action, kept my minds attention, all the characters were interesting. Josh turned out to be a bit of a dork that annoyed me. Our book club is on to The Magician  the second book in The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, Pick this book up it is a must read!!!
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|I saw the movie.  At first I didn't understand what was going on and then realized that the movie was saying that Margaret Thatcher is now a doddering, crazy old woman who walks around talking to her dead husband.  I decided to do some research and realized that she has indeed aged alot in the last 20 years and according to her daughters book is having some memory problems.<br /><br />Carol Thatcher, her daughter never implied that her mother hallucinated or talked to her dead husband.  My belief is that whoever wrote this did not like Margaret Thatcher.  This movie as in the movie 'The Queen' typed up conversations that went on in the intimacy of her own home where no one could have listened to.  The movie was full of ridiculous implications about what Margaret Thatcher said or did in the privacy of her own home with her family as in the movie 'The Queen' (which I believe was done to gain sympathy for the Royal family).<br /><br />I am hoping that after Mrs. Thatcher's passing, Carol Thatcher will write another book and add all the juicy tidbits she left out of her first book as did Lorette Lynne did after her husband died.

0385339089|5.0|The Client is one of those books that once start you can't stop. This is by far one of the best John Grisham books I have ever read. I loved every minute of it and it kept me guessing all the way up until the end. This was one of the first legal thriller books I had read and I was surprised that it was so easy to understand. I was expecting a lot of legal language and confusing, drawn out court room mumbo jumbo but it was just the opposite. The Client is a must read for anyone who is interested in crime or courtroom dramas. I would also recommend that after you read the book you check out the movie version with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. While it isn't on the same level as the book it is still entertaining and visually pleasing.
0739352989|5.0|I loved reading the Trilogy and didn't want to stop so I got the Audiobooks that way I was able to run errands, do chores and still be able to get my Trilogy fix in.  Took a while to upload them onto my computer but well worth it in the long run.  They arrived when they said they would and in the condition they said they'd be in.
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|The Wall is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I've loved this movie from the first time I ever saw it. I FINALLY bought this DVD a few weeks ago after not having seen the movie since I had my LaserDisc player hooked up. Yes, that's right...LaserDisc. I thoroughly enjoy it still. The only problewm I have with it -- the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars -- is that there are numerous audio glitches throughout. Fortunately, those glitches -- they sound much like pops/skips on a vinyl record -- occur during the transitions between two songs, rather than in the middle of songs. Still, they are a little annoying.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|An excellent book following the lives a 6 individuals living under the historically repressive regime in North Korea. The book gives insight to the how the North Koreans view the Kim regime not only as their founding leaders but more like their God and Son of God.  The thoroughness of the brain washing and mind control that touches every facet of their lives is astounding, and should be a lesson for all of us as we have seen glimpses of this in other societies or countries as to what can happen if left unchecked.

B007AJFSJW|2.0|I bought this because Krugman is a very bright Keynesian and this combination seemed likely to shed light on how to get out of our economic fix. I was disappointed. Krugman offers no advance on paleo-Keynesian thinking. Keynes would have been more original. How to exit from massive Government debt, after Keynesian stimulus spending has weaved it's magic, is never addressed, yet this is what holds policy makers back from a Keynesian solution. I expected more from a Nobel Laureate. Keynes would have taken up the issue.

B00005B9R4|4.0|This is first Dylan album i ever bought and listened to for the first time. I just bought it because i turned the back over and liked the titles of the tracks. And this was only 3 months ago! I have in on cd but I am about to purchase it on vinyl. I only gave it four stars because i hated the song Mr Tamberine man...sorry--- i just really do not like that song! But the rest of the album i LOVE. Since this is Dylan's first album going electric and i absolutely loved it then i am almost positive that i would not like his folk albums. I think I like Dylan best when he is supercharged like this. It's alright ma took my breath away the first time i heard it. I knew i was hearing something that no one has ever done and hasnt done since
B0042816YK|1.0|I have enjoyed several of Julia Roberts films, but try as I might, I couldn't even finish the movie.... tried 3 times, but just couldn't do it. Poor acting, story line............ not sure whats up with Miss Roberts, but the last couple of years she has elected to be in several BAD movies.  I hope she finds another winner soon, cause I won't spend any more money on her till I see some GOOD reviews.
0676974945|4.0|I picked this book up for two reasons: It was reviewed on a favorite sci-fi website of mine and the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix) were making it into a movie and I wanted to read it before then. At the beginning I was a little wary because the sci-fi label seemed to be a misnomer (and in general it is as only a third of the book is sci-fi in the tradiational sense)and I found the first section of the book uninteresting. If you are not familiar with the structure of this book, it weaves together 6 shorter stories, each story cutting off in the middle as we flash forward in time to the next story. When the 6th story finishes we pick up the preceeding story where we left off. The stories are only loosely connected in terms of narrative, each being a footnote in the following story. But the stories are all connected in the larger sense of the overall theme. At first I thought the theme was the exertion of power and about people finding themselves under the thumb of oppressors. And while that is largely the case, I think the theme can best be descibed by a line not from the book, but from the trailer of the movie, \\"Why do we keep making the same mistakes?\\" Indeed, the very last pages of the book make a similar statement that puts all of the stories in that context. These are stories about peopel taking what they want because they have the power to do it, and how such behavior, repeated in the future ad ininitum, can only lead to the downfall of civilization as we understand it. It is indeed a powerful message, and it is told from six unique perspectives wherein we witness the oppression inflicted by Europeans on on other races, the power exerted by rich on the powerful, and the oppression of a people created for the purpose of being oppressed. I enjoyed the stories overall, though found the first and second more difficult to enjoy, mostly because I do not usually enjoy historical fiction, but that is probably my own shortcoming. It does have a powerful message, thoughI feel if done correctly the movie will convey that message more powerfully if the trailer is any indication. (Minor spoiler in this next sentence) But I do recommend this book as a less sci-fi alternative to other post-apocalyptic novels.
0425263908|1.0|This book was a bore. While it is being compared to Fifty Shades, it is nothing near as good as Fifty and Fifty was not that great a book. It is copy cat version with two damaged people who have uninteresting sex in boring places. Don't bother....

B00003CXBK|4.0|Another Ghibli anime film, so as usual it is very good. This one is a little different in that the 'treat nature well' message gets a touch murky with the human society development of industry on its hillsides. It will get destroyed, but rebuilt repeatedly like a virus that is left out to grow and spread. The reason is the need for each of us to 'wake up' and choose between private greed and the public's good. The two can be made as one with cooperation and insight and knowledge, but that is a rare thing indeed in our world ruled by the greedsters from WallStreet to MainStreet et al.<br /><br />The greed aspect gets its ill gotten reward that destroys it all, but that greed is seen to return in the future and need be fought endlessly as long as such people remain on the scene. That is a touch of our reality I didn't expect to see in a typical Ghibli film. It also deals with the problems of women and those with diseases etc that get belittled, outcast or downtroddened. Ghibli always deals with the big picture and that is definitely found in this film.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and its free!!! So what are you waiting for! Try this game and you won't be dissapointed!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Another Ghibli anime film, so it is very good, if not excellent as this one is IMO. This one takes on a more mythic nature as it includes those myths of the area and people affecting the daily life of the awakening child who is starting to see the world around her in a different light of possibilities. Hard work getting out of the seeming trap life has thrown her into, like so many of us, she has to learn that she is in fact in a trap to begin with before figuring out a way out of this trap/prison/maze/matrix.<br /><br />It is life's lessons presented to her as she learns to truly see the reality around her. Things aren't always as they seem. It always depends upon how much we can see, how much life and society confines our innate abilities, how it dumbs us down until we become blind unless we grip hard to reality and ride out the storm of challenges presented along the way as the river flows through our life.<br /><br />Another artistic triumph.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 BLU RAY 'Book Pack' ***<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />This is the first US Warner Brothers 'Book Pack' (or Digibook as they sometimes call it) that I've bought on BLU RAY and I'm impressed. It's beautifully presented - and more important - the print has been restored to a truly fantastic degree throughout. There are rarely any occasions when the transfer doesn't show the sweat and grime of this protracted prison drama with anything less than properly gorgeous clarity. It didn't look this good on DVD and that's for damn sure (and it's reasonably priced too).<br /><br />Released May 2011 (barcode: 883929172764) - the other good news for fans outside of the USA is that it's a REGION FREE issue - so will play on every machine.<br /><br />The booklet is 36-pages long and features both full-colour and black-and-white prints of the actors, Director Franklin J. Schaffner (\\"The Caine Mutiny\\", \\"12 Angry Men\\" and \\"Planet Of The Apes\\") and on-set photographs and key scenes from the movie. There's also an info-page pasted to the back of the hardback sleeve but it's flimsy and creases easily - so you might want to put the whole thing in a protective plastic. The disc itself not surprisingly sports a Butterfly logo. But I'd have to say that the side is let down somewhat by the supposed 'Special Features'. Apart from a \\"Theatrical Trailer\\" - the lone extra is called \\"The Magnificent Rebel\\" which lasts just over 12 minutes. Hoffman says a few words, McQueen nothing - however - it does feature the real Charriere revisiting the set designed by people who'd worked on \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Patton\\" - a full scale rebuilding of his prison - complete with gates, walls, cells and guillotine. His ruminations are not surprisingly bitter - \\"Society does not want free men...it wants men to march like sheep...\\" - all police are corrupt - the judicial system vengeful. An unexpected up is that it does at least let you see just how bad the original footage was before restoration - covered in scratches, washed out and undefined...<br /><br />THE FILM:<br />Cited by one drama teacher in the early Sixties as \\"least likely to succeed as an actor\\" - DUSTIN HOFFMAN had just come off a stunning run of layered performances in \\"The Graduate\\" (1967), \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" (1969), \\"Little Big Man\\" (1970) and \\"Straw Dogs\\" (1971). But for me his best nerd-in-over-his-head character is in 1973's \\"Papillon\\" where he absolutely aced it again with his beautifully controlled portrayal of Louis Dega. Dega is a weedy counterfeiter given life imprisonment for money fraud that cost several members of the French Government dear. Such is the severity of life in these tropical prisons and their inhospitable environs (chained communal bedrooms to swamp detail and back again) - Dega with his sticky-taped bifocals is unlikely to live let alone make parole. When the warden warns the arriving inmates in the yard talk to \\"Make the best of what we offer you...and you will suffer less...\\" he isn't joking. Those who attempt escape (and are caught) are publicly beheaded. If he doesn't rot to death in solitary - Dega will be stabbed in his sleep for his knowledge. The only way for Louis to survive is to buy protection. In this he is unwillingly paired with Henri Charriere (played by STEVE McQUEEN) - a man claiming he's innocent because he was framed for murder - but an inmate genuinely capable of handling himself and others. Charriere sports a Butterfly tattoo on his chest ('Papillon' in French) and is a spirit that will not be contained no matter what the dehumanizing regimes throw at him (long spells in solitary on barely subsistence food). Across 14 years that feel like 40 and 8 failed escape attempts - the wildly differing duo are then finally sent to the notorious penitentiary on Devil's Island - a rock in the Atlantic off the coast of South America (owned at that time by French Guiana) that also houses a leper colony. Surrounded by cliffs and an unforgivingsea - escape (they are told) is not possible. But even bruised, battered and considerably older by the end of the film - Papillon has other ideas...<br /><br />It has to be said that this is a long movie - and decades of incarceration and brutality may not be everyone's idea of a fun night in. But the fantastical twisting story (which at times beggars belief - the nun's segment in particular) and the two leads firing on all sixes - produces a damn near irresistible combination. Both McQueen and Hoffman wisely avoid the trap of a buddy-buddy movie. These are two prisoners who don't even like each other much but have to co-exist in a living Hell. Yet both actors got under the skin of their characters so much that there are moments when Dega and Charriere simply look at each other and silently 'know' - dreams of freedom must be repressed - just thinking about it is too painful and wearing...<br /><br />McQueen's 'Papillon' in particular (whether based on a real man or not) is a fantastic creation. Wilful yet somehow kind - bloody-minded yet fair - his Papillon is infused with an indomitable spirit. When in one of his long solitary confinement stretches (surviving on pacing the cell and eating cockroaches) - he looks up at the shaft of light above him coming through the steel bars he can't reach and croaks with defiance \\"Hey! You bastards! I'm still here!\\" Waist-deep in stinking rivers and thick mud, bedding on hard concrete floors and traipsing around in bedraggled rags in the ever-present swelter (partially filmed in Jamaica) - McQueen suffered for the part. But he knew it had substance and soul - so he dug in to find his man...and succeeded with grace and dignity. The role even replaced Steve McQueen 'The Star' with Steve McQueen 'The Actor' - ditching his 'coolest man on Earth' persona and proving his critics wrong.<br /><br />\\"Papillon\\" is a magnificent film - still resonant to this day nearly 40 years after the event. It may leave you feeling like you've taken a day-long hike through the desert with the Foreign Legion followed by a full body dip in a cesspool to cool down afterwards - but it's a difficult watch that is 'so' worth the difficulty.<br /><br />Recommended big time...<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />PICTURE: 1080p High Definition, 16 x 9 and 2.4:1 Aspect Ratios (Fills Full Screen)<br />AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio, English 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English for Hard-Of Hearing, French and Spanish<br />EXTRAS: Theatrical Trailer and a 12-minute featurette called \\"The Magnificent Rebel\\"sea - escape (they are told) is not possible.

B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Ok, another Ghibli work of art which of course means it is excellent as usual. Isn't that a good thing to have as your reputation? There are similar themes in most of their product line, usually a respect for nature that modern industrial imperial economies have forsaken in ignorance of the usual karmic aspects from such disrespect. There is a price to be paid, a cause and effect relationship, whether you know and understand it or not. This film is a nice telling of that price on the people even as the tunnel vision empire builders keep repeating their mistakes endlessly in their ignorance. This makes the story rather timeless given it is the human tradition for the past many eons that continue today. The names change, but the practices remain the same.<br /><br />Take care of Mama, and mama will take care of you.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this album. Sure, it ain't the scorching stuff he used to play early in his career, but there's a lot to like here. Me, I pop this on, sit on my deck with a cold one, and relax to this soothing CD!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This is an excellent recent anime film that could very easily be made into a live action Hollywood film IMO. From start to finish, it really does deliver well. It's unique and socially responsible to boot. Interesting.
B0085LUEMK|5.0|Love, love, love this book!  Kim gives such straight-forward, useful information on designing fabric!  Her section on creating repeats by hand is wonderful - I've never seen such clear instructions as these!  The only thing is - I wish I would have purchased the physical version instead of the Kindle version!  I may go back and purchase that one for quick reference!  :)
B001UV4XIS|3.0|It's ok, but not very good, just like the last few films that this director has made of this franchise. The fact that the producers kept him on is telling of their own problems. The whole series needed a better team. The scriptwriter was never any good IMO, and the producer's have to take the blame for that one as well as they kept him on and kept going back to him. The complaint for the series is much the same, too much was left out, and given the slow pace of the films, just try and find a reason why that is? The pace is so slow it seems we are watching ice melt, so you can't say time constraints are to blame.<br /><br />Oh well, it's ok, just barely. Perhaps if you haven't read the books the films won't seem so bad. Obviously, IMO the 3rd film was the best. Yes, the films got worse as the books got longer, but that is the fault of the production team, writer, director etc IMO. So much was either left out or changed and replaced by scenes that added nothing to the storyline, that one wonders about the English film/tv industry, yet all the actors were wonderful. Well, the kids grew up in the series, so you can't blame them for being more than kids at the time of the early films, which IMO were actually better despite the acting of the kids at times. They learned their craft, yet the story was fiddled with so much by the screenwriter and last director, that it isn't worth watching the films IMO. Go read the books first so you can fully feel the wasted results of this last film. The script is just plain mediocre at best leaving the actors little to do most of the time but pose and parade. It's a sad fact is it not? I wish them well, as I cannot wish well on the producers, writers and directors, no wonder the third one didn't want to come back. Too bad, they really needed him or someone with a little vision or even someone that could just plain condense the book better either on paper or film, but alas, that was not to be.<br /><br />Imagine being one of the actors and having to go out on the interview circuit to promote the film! You have to have nice things to say which is nearly impossible in this case. Oh well, good thing it's over, maybe now a tv live action version can be made or a anime version, which could be even better, but with the 'Day After Tomorrow' reality coming in the next couple of years, that is not likely to happen.
B005LAIHQS|1.0|this has got to be the worst movie Will Smith has done. my wife & i were DRUNK sleep (she fell out within the first 7 min) throughout nearly the entire movie; although quite hilarious, the trailer was ... it turned out to be a grave disappointment<br /><br />sorry will smith fans (especially you women); i am one also, however.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|All the Ghibli anime films are very well made. This one is a little different in that it takes place with the main character under some spell that gives him the appearance of a pig until near the end he breaks it, sort of like any mythical character, which fits in with the almost timeless quality of the story. It takes place in the 20s? to near 30s as the Spanish Civil War is looming on the horizon, if I remember correctly. It is enjoyable, but not one you are going to watch repeatedly. It would have been better IMO, if the his last encounter with the woman at the very end was highlighted a touch more to finish off the seemingly antihero mythically nature of the story. Other than that, well done.
B005FITIDC|2.0|Got this for my husband for his birthday and we where both very disappointed in the movie.  I don't know if it was the scrip, the director, or actor but I am sorry I got this for him.
6304493681|4.0|I liked it. Saw it before the tv series, which I wasn't too keen on. This film had a better look and feel to it than the tv series IMO. The same interesting 'ghost in the machine' effect in the storyline that's been used often through the decades as the computing age has developed, so has the fear of it's affect upon us as it goes into the stages of developing self-awareness. A residue fear of late Atlantean cataclysms it would seem, and for a good reason. This film is very good, the second film I didn't care much for, as it didn't continue this storyline, though I think a later film or tv series did.
1475143389|5.0|The workouts are great. No over training, they last a quality 30-45 minutes. The meal plan is very detailed but efficient.  I plan on following this a little looser than prescribed.  Overall, the book is filled with great solid information back by well researched science.  It sounds cliche but it really is a good read for a beginner or experienced lifter.  This book should be way more popular than it is.  Maybe the word hasn't gotten out yet.
055358894X|5.0|I am a critical person. Even when I really love something, there's always *something* I can say, something that could have been better. This book? PERFECT.<br /><br />The story is engaging, the characters are believable even when they're larger-than-life, the pacing is fast and fun, and oh man, is there some great humour here.<br /><br />Scott Lynch has really set the bar for the Gentleman Bastard series nigh-impossibly high. I can't wait to see how he lives up to his own debut!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is such a great game! I'm addicted to it =] there is so much to do. it may take a while to get started, but so worth it!
0553801473|2.0|There is a somewhat humorous analogy hidden somewhere in the sea of black letters about a constipated fat man trying to take a sh!t.  That pretty much sums up this book.  Actually, Martin's sea of letters is much like the Dothraki sea....it is a huge expanse of repetitive scenery in which nothing much of significance happens.<br /><br />As a caveat, I loved the 1st 3 books.  I also love the world Martin has created and do not mind his verbosity in describing characters and settings in detail.  I also do not mind the violence, sex, or fickleness of the world he has created.  However, Martin's fundamental problem with AFFC and ADOD is that he does not move the plot forward.  He introduces so many new characters that I have an easier time keeping track of the elves names in the Similarion.  I understand he is expanding the universe and building up the \\"eastern/southern\\" culture.  But so many of his characters are pointless.  And by pointless, I mean that they are introduced only to die or disappear after having contributed nothing to the plot or storyline.  Also, Martin feels the need to create an intricate backstory for every character--which would be fine if they did something important.  Why do I, as a reader, need to slog through 5 pages of filler backstory for a charter who makes only minor appearances?<br /><br />Additionally, why oh why does he insist upon giving us a morass of characters with similar sounding unpronounceable names?  There is another scene in the book where one of the characters complains that all of the names sound alike and he cannot distinguish one from the next.....that would be pretty funny except for the fact that it is the very same experience I had reading the book.  Martin has an infatuation with arkks zzzts dizarss razakss that all blend together.  If you are going to give a character a wierd name, at least make the character interesting.  I had to constantly look up people's names because the names were so unpronounceable and characters so forgettable!  And then in the middle of the arkks zzzts dizarss razakss, there is a shavepate.  When i read that I said WTF is a shavepate? and again needed to turn to the internet.<br /><br />Another example of Martin's inability to move along the plot is the storyline of Tyrion in this book.  I completely understand what Martin is doing with Tyrion's character, but he just takes so long to do it.  I mean, the whole river story plot-line was utterly pointless.  Martin could have just had Tyrion get kidnapped on his way to Pentos and wind up in Merreen with half the pages.  Don't get me wrong, I LIKED the river storyline.....but it didn't get us anywhere. To make another LOTR comparison, it would be like following Sam and Frodo all the way to Mount Doom only to have Frodo decide that the whole ring-quest thing is rather silly, and he'd rather throw in with the elves leaving Middle-Earth.<br /><br />Also, Martin's knack for bringing dead characters back to life hurts the story and diminishes the world he has created.  I liked the fact that no main character was safe.  But if they are all going to come back to life anyways....what's the point in them dying to begin with?  Then, to make matters worse, he doesn't even use the potential of these undead characters.  Catlin Stark as an angry p!ssed off ghost hell-bent on killing all the Freys would have made for interesting reading.  Unfortunately, there is none of that in this book.  There is another character whom we presumed was dead that makes an appearance, but all he does is float down a river.<br /><br />Then, there is Martin's equal knack for sucking the life out of characters that we loved.  Tyrion becomes little more than a drunken  court jester who constantly asks where whores go.  No cunning; no real witticisms; no plotting.  Tyrion just does as he's told and makes an a$$ out of himself.  Dany goes from a powerful intriguing character to a whinny teenager obsessed with screwing bad boys.  The Dragons go from being the ultimate chess piece, to little more than pets locked in a cage...that escape.  Bran turns into a tree....literally.  Jon turns down the opportunity to reclaim his rightful place as a Stark and instead decides to count sausages and wildings and does everything possible to pi$$ people off around him.  So much wasted potential.  Barristan the Bold is now Barristan the Old.  Within 2 books, Martin has managed to suck all the life out of all my favorite characters.  I did enjoy the Arya story/assassin training, but it was done in such a way that it had nothing to do with the plot of the main story.  Stannis does nothing but stand in snow and grit his teeth.  The Red Woman stares into fires and prays a lot.  Cercie gets her comeuppance, but in a fashion that is entirely bereft of poetic justice.  And then SURPRISE!  Someone else we thought was dead is back again!  Someone gie me an Arrrrgggkra!<br /><br />At this point, I don't know if I even care how this thing comes out.  And now, I read it that he intends to write EIGHT--not seven books to finish this story.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of it all is that he has done such a good job of setting up the finale, it should not take so long to get there.  In order to finish this off, he needs the following to occur: 1) The Others need to attack; 2) Dany needs to invade Westeros; 3) Ayra needs to finish her assassin training and return to Westeros on a mission that tears her soul up (i.e., she needs to be sent to kill Sansa or someone she cares about); 4) Samwell needs to get back to the wall and finish his transformation from coward to unlikely hero; 5) Cercie needs to die a painful horrible death; 6) The dragons/Bran/Samwell kill all the Others; 7) Tyrion marries his dwarf girl; and 8) I don't even care who gets the iron throne at this point.<br /><br />Despite all this, yes, I will pony up the dough to read the next offering in this adrift series with the small hope it gets back on course.

0307352145|5.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking was very helpful for me.  I really learned a lot about myself and how to cope in an extrovert world.  There was so much quality information in this book and I enjoyed reading about the studies done and examples from various people.  I highly recommend this book to introverts and extroverts who want to know how to better connect with the introverts in their lives.

0345803507|2.0|Okay, if no one saw the way this relationship was going to play out, I'm sorry you haven't read that many books in your life. Congratulations for reading more than what you have in the past.<br />For the rest of us, this book was so predictable it was boring.  Needless to say, I read a 500 page book in just over 7 hours because I had to be somewhere for brunch and refused to leave without finishing this thing. Yeah, I'm one of those people that doesn't like to not finish a book just because it's horrible.<br /><br />If you've read the first 2 and you just want to know the ending, then read this...otherwise save yourself and just imagine how it will end. Because, whatever you're imagining is probably true.
0345803493|3.0|Still just spanking and maybe some anal play but, still not really BDSM (as I think of it, anyway).  Realistically, these books are just a shade darker than vanilla. Considering I don't think the word vagina is written anywhere in the first 2 books I really can't see why these books would be banned from anywhere.<br /><br />The romance is still going but, it's just a run of the mill Cinderella story. Rich dude, girl from an impoverished background loving one another. It's a decent read if you're in between series or just don't know what you want to read but if you don't read these I'm sure you'll survive.

0307730697|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Fearless, the account of real life hero and Navy SEAL, Adam Brown.  While I feel that the story of Adam's life -- his childhood, troubled young adulthood, his journey to become a SEAL and the struggles he faced due to his one time addiction -- is a triumph of God's power and provision, I am reluctant to recommend it to just anyone because of the profanity and crude language it contains.  I am not so naive to believe that the men our country trains to be our ultimate warriors are choir boys, but I am a little dismayed that Waterbrook (the publisher) chose not to edit the manuscript more closely.  I say all this because while I feel Fearless is certainly a story worth reading, you (the future reader) should be aware of some of its content.<br /><br />Fearless is the story of a real man. Adam Brown did have a lot of the characteristics of a super hero:  grit and determination, the attitude that he would rather die than quit and a love of family and country not to be paralleled. But Adam was human as well.  He hit bottom before joining the Navy -- drugs, felony charges, and the loss of respect and trust of his family and friends.  He struggled with the lure of drugs even into his Navy career.  But his steadfast faith and the love of his wife brought Adam to be the man that could be used by his country and by his God.  And the fact that he wanted his story, all of it, to be told is a testament to his trust in God and His power to change lives.<br /><br />So should you read Fearless?  If you want to know about a very courageous young man whose faith was in God and want to know a little of what our most elite warriors do to prepare and fight, then yes.  But be aware that the language may offend.<br /><br />(I received Fearless from Waterbrook in return for a review.  The opinions expressed are mine alone.)
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was so excited to see this when it came out in theaters a while ago; afterall, Ridley Scott has some pretty impressive work under his belt (some of which have even become favorites of mine). However, this movie was a huge disappointment for me. Usually I like movies that keep me thinking long after I've watched them, but this wasn't one of those GOOD thought provoking movies. This movie just leaves the audience confused. I admired the direction that the movie was striving for (where do we come from, who made us, etc.), but this garbage only answers those questions with more questions. It's almost like Scott was watching \\"Ancient Aliens\\" on the History Channel (which I do enjoy by the way) and decided to make a movie based on that premise. Furthermore, I thought the creature design was terrible in this movie! Oh! Look! A giant squid! What is this?! 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?!! I feel like Scott has gone the way of Spielberg and Lucas and began mining his old classics, only to replace them with new Sh!t. The performances in this movie are great, but when you work with a terrible script there's not much that can save a movie from that. Even if you are a fan of science fiction, save your money on this one. It's only worth a rental at most.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have been a comic book fan since I was eight years old (long before it was popular), and am so excited to see what they are doing with comic book movies now! Marvel has done such an amazing job turning their properties into entertaining movies (for the most part, Daredevil, ugh). DC... Not so much. I just want to mention that at heart I am a die-hard Batman fan (Batman was the very first comic book I ever owned). That being said, I felt like this movie was better than the Dark Knight Rises. Call me a traitor if you like, but I felt like the 'Rises' story was pretty weak this time around. I was concerned about this movie from the beginning. I didn't know how in the hell they were going to make a good movie with so many heroes involved, and I didn't know what villain they were going to conjure up that would be sufficient enough to bring these heroes together! Well, they succeeded! Buy it, it is SO amazing!!!

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Their sound & style may not be for everyone, but nobody with a brain can deny that this is some of the most truly unique music in the world today.  With a very unusual combination of instruments (guitar, trumpet, piano, banjo, and very minimal drums played by the singer with his FEET, while he also plays guitar!) and songs based almost entirely on classic literature (several Shakespeare plays, The Odyssey, The Grapes of Wrath, Plato's \\"Allegory of the Cave\\") you really just can't compare these guys to anybody.  Like I said, the sound may not be for everyone, it's extremely raw and very folky, and some may not enjoy Marcus Mumford's coarse voice, but if you can enjoy all those things, you will be able to experience a musical treat you'll devour again and again, getting more out of it each time.<br /><br />Also, frontman Marcus Mumford hosts a bookclub from the band's website.  Pretty cool, huh?
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is one of those books that made me very happy that there is a book two.  I went right from \\"day one\\" to \\"day two\\" as though it were one long book.  Rothfuss is so adept at inventing an alternative world that it seems real enough to be a place I could live.  The lead character is well done and fully rounded out.  Supporting characters are also complete, so that I felt like I knew them all.  Everything is different, from the kind of currency used to the beings that inhabit his world.  He makes \\"magic\\" so real that I would love to try some of the things done by Kvothe.  Kvothe is presented as a mature man telling his story and his narrative is striking.  There are recurring themes, such his being a member of the consumate storytellers, the Edema Ruh, that help make so much of the book work smoothly and naturally.  All told, a very enjoyable read.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|I have always been a gymnastics fan, and I can remember the 96 Olympics vividly, which drew me to this book. I was astonished to learn so much about the gymnastic world and its politics, but not surprised by any of what I read. I am greatly impressed by Dominique's strength and perseverance, and greatly enjoyed reading about her life. She is a significant role model for anyone venturing into professional sports and for any young woman.
1401937519|3.0|I have read several books on the topic of NDE. I would say this one was a little disappointing. My problem with her story has to do with what happens to criminals in the next life. Her opinion is they will not be judged or punished. This goes counter to what you read in other NDE stories. I decided to take from this story what I could apply to my life to make it better. I would recommend Return from Tomorrow as a better NDE book to read. That book will get you thinking and help you to want to straighten out your life for the better.
B004LROMSO|1.0|This series falls into an odd position - not good at all and too bad to be really any fun.  The sets are like Xena (which was forgivable due to the comedic nature of that series), the dialog ATROCIOUS, and the plot muddled.  The acting was a mixed lot - Fiennes PHONED in his performance, but Eva Green gave it her best shot.  The \\"action\\" and the nudity may have spiced things up (ala 'Rome' or 'Spartacus'), if they were handled in a competent way.  AVOID this show!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Absoulutely awesome and refreshing. I loved it so much I read 29 and A Half Wishes. It was great to read about a character who has little or no world experience in our world of Go, Go, Go! What a beautiful experience.
1427215006|5.0|I loved this modern retelling of Cinderella! It has been nominated for the ALA Teens' Top Ten Award for 2012.<br /><br />I love fairy tales, and I have to admit that I was initially skeptical when I heard about a Cyborg Cinderella. I thought that the story would be too high-tech for me or just too weird. I was wrong! I loved it!!<br /><br />The story takes place in the future after World War IV. Linh Cinder was originally from Europe, and she was involved in a horrific car accident at the age of 11 years which tragically killed her parents. Seriously injured, she had to undergo numerous operations and procedures and some cyborg parts were needed to replaced her human parts that were no longer working. She is approximately 35% cyborg. From outward appearances, she appears human because skin has been grafted onto some of her visible parts. Cinder has no recollection of her life before the accident, and she was told that the part of her brain that is responsible for memory suffered some injuries.<br /><br />Cinder is brought to New Beijing by Linh Garan, who is a scientist who had been working on a cyborg prototype. Unfortunately, he dies and Cinder is left in the care of her step-mother, Linh Adri, who never wanted her in the first place! Her elder step-sister, Linh Pearl, is equally mean to her. The only one who is nice to her is her younger step-sister, Linh Peony.<br /><br />Cinder spends her days slaving away in her booth in the market square, where she works as a mechanic fixing anything that is electrical in nature. One day, she is visited by the Emperor's son, Prince Kai, who brings a cyborg to her to be fixed. I loved the banter between Cinder and Kai, who becomes smitten with Cinder! He asks her to be his date for the upcoming ball, but she declines his invitation because she is planning to run away from New Beijing.<br /><br />A plague called letumosis has been affecting the world's population for the past 12 years, and the Emperor has become afflicted with the disease. In an attempt to find a cure before the Emperor dies, the scientists call for cyborgs to become test subjects for plague research. So far, none of the cyborgs have survived the disease either.<br /><br />Cinder's step-sister, Linh Peony, contracts letumosis and Linh Adri \\"volunteers\\" Cinder to be used as plague research, which results in a hefty sum paid to Linh Adri in recognition of Cinder's contribution to medical research. The secrets about Cinder that the scientists uncover will change everyone's life.<br /><br />To round out the story, Meyer has included a civilization that inhabits the moon called \\"lunars.\\" The queen of the lunars, Queen Levana, has tried to make inroads with the Emperor for years and wants to marry Prince Kai so that she can become Empress. Lunars have the ability of mind control and can alter people's perceptions of them. She is wicked and wants to rule Planet Earth.<br /><br />I can't believe that this is Meyer's debut novel! It was fantastic!! The flirtation between Prince Kai and Cinder was sweet but had great chemistry. I love that Cinder is a little bit sarcastic and that she doesn't fall all over herself just because Kai is royalty. Linh Adri is delightfully wicked as Cinder's step-mother, and Queen Levana shows promise as an evil antagonist. I loved the sci-fi futuristic element to the story, and I adored Dr. Dmitri Erland, the scientist heading up the plague research. I can hardly wait for the next in the series, Scarlet, which is slated to be released in February 2013. It sounds like Little Red Riding Hood is going to be intertwined with the Cinderella story, and I can't wait to see how Meyer accomplishes that!<br /><br />Narrator Rebecca Soler is new to me, and I enjoyed the attitude that she brought to Cinder. I felt that she brought the right amount of emotion to the characters. Her Dr. Erland voice is my favourite!<br /><br />MY RATING: 5 stars!! It was superb! I loved it, and I will likely re-read it again in thefuture! You should definitely read it!future! You should definitely read it!

0385737955|3.0|This was an ok book. I am not running out to get the second book immediately even though the two chapters included in this book were a good beginning. I don't rule out continuing the series but it's not a burning need. It's a book that is full of action and would probably be a good book for boys for that reason.<br /><br />  I saw the book as a metaphor for trying to follow a moral, religious (Christian or other) life. The boys in the book feel like pawns in a Creator's game that they can't quite understand but nonetheless they try to do the right thing that will please this body. They must have faith and perseverance even when they don't know the outcome. This metaphor is there but it could have been developed better.

0307949486|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larson is a thriller that I wanted to keep reading. Once Blomkvist was called upon to solve the Vanger family mystery and the reader is introduced to the villains, it's hard to put the book down.<br /> \\"I want you to find out who in the family murdered Harriet\\", says Mr. Vanger (an old, sickly, very wealthy business man) to Blomkvist. This is where the mystery begins, but not where it ends. Blomkvist takes on the challenge to solve this murder mystery (while dealing with his own personal complications with work and realtionships) but along the way receives help from a troubled, but skilled investigator, in her 20's. Her name is Lisabeth and she has problems of her own.<br /> The reader gets a peek into Lisabeth's life outside of just solving the mystery where you meet the state appointed guardian to Lisabeth, a disgusting man named Bjurman. Bjurman's unthinkable actions against Lisabeth Salander really have the reader pulling for Lisabeth to seek revenge.<br />  Many of the topics will trigger emotional reactions from the reader, including injustice, murder, sexual assault, romantic relationships and more. These topics leave room for a lot of argument and discussion. The issues are ongoing throughout the entire book so you have to read to the end. The ending satisfies the reader yet sets the stage for a sequel to the novel.

B002ZCY7SW|2.0|I dont usually write reviews for Amazon.com but in this case I feel I have to. I didnt give the product 2 stars for its content. Id give the content 3 out of 5 Wasnt the best season by any stretch of the imagination and Jack Bauer deserved a GREAT season.It did have a feww moments...Anyways back to the reason im writing this review..I oroignially odered this about a month ago direct from Amazon.com...and there was major scratches on disc 2 which was unplayable..OK i simply sent it back for a replacement..My replacement arrives and theres a Glue substance all over the edges of Disc 1..I was able to clean it off for the player to read..Anyways I was half way through the season and Disc 4 skips...WITH NO SCRATCHES OR SMUDGES WHATSOEVER...I am now on my THIRD copy in less than a month..If this one is damaged or doesnt work, im just getting a refund
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Having so thoroughly enjoyed \\"Jacob de Zoet,\\" I dove into \\"Cloud Atlas\\" without even bothering to glance at any reviews or summaries.  And then for 250 some odd pages, I wondered what the hell I'd gotten myself into!  It was clear that there was an implied connection between the characters, perhaps even that each era's narrator was an incarnation of the one before.  Beyond that, I couldn't tell.  But then you come over the hump in the middle of the book, the interrupted eras pick back up in reverse succession, and it all ends as one might expect.<br /><br />Mitchell does a more-than-admirable job breathing life into his characters through their dialog.  Indisputably, his method and manner of narrative are interesting and render the tale well.  My loudest gripe about the book is that it is so self-consciously clever.  I had a distinct sense that Mitchell was hoping to render script plotting techniques that have proven so successful for writers like Steven Moffat (\\"Doctor Who\\") and J.J. Abrams (\\"Lost\\") into prose.  While it made for a fun read, the acrobatics with the plot and delivery could be heavy handed in parts.  Like watching a child jumping up and down trying to get his mother's attention.  Or a writer of literary fiction trying to make his book attractive to Hollywood...<br /><br />Another, lesser gripe I have is that this story-within-a-story-within-a-story Mitchell uses to create \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" along with the strains of corporate dystopianism, are strongly reminiscent of Margaret Atwood.  And Atwood does it better.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a great game however it lags a lot and sometimes it is so bad you will randomly die.
0553582038|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series, but this book is an epic waste of time.  I could not put down Storm of Swords... and directly after finishing that book, I would have been like to say that this was my favorites series ever.<br /><br />There is basically nothing interesting or relevant to the plot that couldn't have been described in 1/5 as many pages.  From what I see of reviews of Dance with Dragons, the same seems to be true for that as well.  How disappointing.  I feel like I have wasted my time investing my attention into the major characters only to be put on hold (...will it be more than 10 years?).  If you are interesting in being drawn into some boring tale of traveling nobodies who increasingly introduce us to less and less important nobodies each subsequent chapter, this book is for you.  George - we get it - the war is/has been terrible, things are in disarray and it is affecting everyone.  I just don't care to hear the point of view of all of Westoros regarding the subject.<br /><br />At this point forward, I'm just going to watch the HBO series in hopes that it can salvage the story and actually condense into something interesting after Storm of Swords.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|This game is really addicting. Although it is kind of hard at first, once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. The 3D graphics are pretty sweet and the cars are really nice. One thing I don't like is there is really no reward. Maybe you get an award after getting 3 stars on every level, but some of them are super hard. So, if you are a fan of cars and getting around opsticles( this is not a racing game) this is a good game for you.
B002ZBZNPO|3.0|Sure, their first album would be difficult to beat given the overwhelmingly good response it got and the huge sales.  So I didn't expect their second album to neccessarily top that, but for me this album just didn't deliver what I had expected.<br /><br />Amy Lee has a great voice, but something is missing from this album, the songs just don't stick with you like most of the tracks from Fallen do.  I've owned this CD for several years and I still listen to Fallen and some of their early works much more often than I do this CD.<br /><br />For me the themes of the music seem to be what has changed.  In my mind the first album was more spiritual, while this album leans more toward gothic/fantasy type stuff.  I understand that Amy Lee did not want Evanescence to be classified as a \\"Christian\\" rock band (and they never really were in my mind - more along the lines of Creed perhaps), but for me it was those underlying spiritual/christian themes that made the music great.  It (for me at least) gave the songs more meaning and made them more memorable.  Sadly, I think some of this was lost when some of the original members of Evanescence left.<br /><br />I haven't heard their latest album yet, but am certainly more hesitant to buy it after purchasing this one.  Still a decent and original sound from Amy Lee and Evanescence, but not what I had expected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|muito legal. distrai como poucos jogos. o tempo voa e vc se distrai. nao preciso de mais palavrss psra deecrever
B008JGSM6G|5.0|when I got the game I thought it wouldn't be that much fun but when I started play I could not stop playing
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game very entertaining and addictive. graphics and animation are superb and realistic I recommend virtual city playground best city building game ever.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is a classic movie. It had been a few years since I had seen this film and the blu-ray version is perfect. It's the best version of this film that I've seen since watching it in the movie theatre all those years ago. Great cast, great music and funny as all get out.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I've been a Testament fan since 1988 and always enjoyed all of their releases ( Demonic was a little to harsh for my taste ) this new album brings it all back to their \\"Dark Roots\\"<br />There is a nice combo of all school thrash mixed in with some of the more modern sounding thrash and even a good ole metal ballad to boot.<br />The album opens up with \\"Rise Up\\" and kicks you right in the face from the beginning ( One of my fav's on the new album), then Native Blood a song very close to Chuck Billy's heart about the Native Indians I must say Chuck still sounds as good as ever . The Title track Dark Roots of The Earth\\" has they very familiar old school feel to it reminds me of something off of \\"The Legacy\\" days. \\"True American Hate\\" is another one that has a old school feel ( actually one of my least favorite sounds, even though I still like it alot)<br /><br />My favorites on the album are:<br />Rise Up<br />Dark Roots of the Earth<br />A Day in a Death<br />Cold Embrace ( The Ballad of the album)<br />Man Kills Mankind ( My personal fav on the album awesome soloing )<br />Throne of Thorns ( Extended Version)<br /><br />All in all a great album from Testament, everyone sounds great and the production is kick ass too!! one of the best Metal albums of the year so far!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD is basically a documentary about how meat is processed in this country and it was very informative.  I purchased it after hearing about it on the Oprah Winfrey show. After watching it 3 times, I became a vegetarian at the age of 56 years old. It changed my life and made me realize that a lot of the sickness and disease we suffer from today is a direct result of what we eat. I am healthier and in better physical condition than when I was a carnivore.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wasn't sure if my husband would have an interest, but thought I'd try the Kindle version.  He couldn't put it down.  Very interesting about a man that literally started in the garage and worked his way up to providing what would become a profound influence on the entire world.<br /><br />Sadly, his time was too short.  One can only imagine what could have still been done by this brillant man. I carry an iPhone in my pocket that provides me with the world and information at my fingertips.......all in a phone!  Wonder what Alexander Graham Bell would think?<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone whether you have a keen interest in the computer world/electronics or just want to know how one overcame so much to become so vital to the world.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app I use it a lot and I love the challenge. I very much recommend this app.
B006RUJST6|2.0|The book did keep my attention, but I thought it was poorly done.  I spotted many grammatical errors, and the prose was dull and unpolished.  I found the plot melodramatic:  too much tragedy, too much angst, too much pop psychology, lots of terrible poetry.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel that we need to go back to the days when books had professional editing.<br /><br />On the positive side: The story moved well, and I liked the character of the heroine's little brother.  As a mom, I don't think I would ever leave a child to the sole guardianship of an 18-year-old!
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought this series after hearing about it from EVERYONE!<br /><br />Series is good, Im not going to critique the novels themselves, though I will say, I was impressed with how well the kindle version is. I have only purchased virtual books on the kindle, though I have friends who buy them for their iPhone ect. I hear complaints about spelling mistakes, punctuation and other grammar issues.<br /><br />I didn't not find any of those complaints with these novels. Im not an English professor by any means, but it does bother me when there is an error.<br />Also, I thoroughly enjoy that I can look up the description of a particular word while reading on my kindle by simply touching and holding my finger on the particular word. What a great feature!<br /><br />And you can NOT beat this price. Even for soft covers you are paying a pretty penny. Plus with the kindle, you can read in public and no one will know what you are reading about!
0439813786|5.0|I may be addicted to books. I love to look at them, touch them, smell them, and read them. I could live in a library! This book is beautiful. Beautifully written, illustrated, and presented.<br /><br />The illustrations are part of the story. You read part of it, you see part of it. It's a kind of graphic novel, almost a movie on paper.<br /><br />The story is fantastic. Hugo is an orphan living inside the walls of a train station in France. His dad was working on a special project when he died, and Hugo is determined to finish it. He uncovers a fantastic secret about a shop owner in the station along the way.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie, but I love the book. I love the characters, the setting, and the story. I love the beauty of the book. This one is a winner!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for my son and myself! some games are much harder than others! someone wrote it only wrked when near wifi but mine wrks fine even in the car!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I love to read, but I'm not really a romance novel kind of girl. I guess this would be considered more erotica than romance, but that's not really my genre either. I gave into the hype for this one, though.<br /><br />The writing is pretty sad. The story is ridiculous. The sex is pretty good, but not realistic at all. I mean, someone who can orgasm as quickly and easily as this chick doesn't need Christian Grey! She could probably drive over a speed bump and get off.<br /><br />It basically comes down to housewife porn. After being in control, taking care of everyone, and making decisions all day, a woman just wants a man to take control in the bedroom. Christian Grey does that....although on a completely different level.<br /><br />If you're curious, read it. But don't expect to be overly impressed. The hype is just that. There's nothing earth shattering here, just sexual fantasy on paper.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Got charged twice for this movie - ordered it on my computer, but played it later through Roku and ended up with 2 charges on my credit card. The movie itself was bittersweet as it brilliantly edited the main character's life from a small child to an elderly adult and set up the movie's emotions in the first few minutes. No matter what your age, there is always a place for you in the circle of life and you can have an impact if you choose.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool and easy to use. It's the closest one I have seen to a desk calculator!
0671449028|5.0|I have been using this book since my son was 4 mnths old. he is 8 mnths now and it is a mst bedtime ritual. He listens to this book very patiently, its a cute book with nice colorful pictures. the story is cute.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I wasn't sure how this would go over with my 5 year old, but she LOVES it, especially Captain Amelia.  A little scary at times, but if your kids can handle the scary parts of Princess and the Frog, they can handle it.  The story is decent enough to keep adults engaged and the featured songs are by the Goo Goo Dolls.  It's a win in this house.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very  much a platformer . short levels reminds me of super mario world game play. it could have a more developed story but its free
B002POVIMS|5.0|I've heard \\"Bulletproof\\" on the radio over the past few years but never bothered to find out who did it until recently, and boy am I glad I did!  La Roux is not just another pop duo and Elly Jackson is not just another pop singer.  La Roux manages to seamlessly mix 80's, New Wave style aesthetics with genuine, emotive lyrics and vocals.  The sound and feel reminds me of Depeche Mode in their early days.  It makes for a fun listen right off the bat but instead of shortly becoming tiresome, it actually grows on you as you begin to perceive and appreciate the many facets of each song.  Each song is a beautifully crafted piece of pop art sourced from Elly's own experiences and you can hear and feel their genuine character.  Beyond that, Elly has an incredible range both vocally and emotionally.  She so totally changes the sound and feel of her voice that she sounds like a different person from song to song.  It makes for a very interesting and satisfying musical experience.  Highly Recommended!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app. it is handy so I don't have to figure problems out in my head. I reccomend this to other people
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sexy, sexy, sexy!  An enjoyable and erotic reading experience.  I`m going to buy the next two books in the series.
B002YVAT72|2.0|If you're over 40 -- remember your first stereo?  It probably had a turntable (phonograph) attached to the tuner and amplifier.  I'm amazed that ION chose to reproduce that turntable for its low-end unit.  The tonearm is flimsy and lacks any adjustments:  I almost got out a penny to see if records would track better.  Further, the volume out of the USB connection was much too low to be usable with my Mac and its Audacity software.<br /><br />The nicest thing I can say is that the plastic cover seemed good.<br /><br />I'd previously returned a Numark TTUSB to the store because it had developed a wow issue.  This product was no substitute, not at any price.  As such, I've returned it.<br /><br />BTW, I'm not very pleased with the seller, either.  Beach Camera chose to have me pay all postage to return the unit, costing me almost $15 for a $65 purchase.  I'll be interested to see if I get my full money back, and I now know better than to use this seller again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The premise of the game is so easy to grasp that the icon was all the documentation I needed to start playing.  Of the three hundred free play levels, only three were so ridiculously difficult that they took me more than a day to solve.  The timed play is frantic and fun as well.  I highly recommend this game and I hope they come out with a paid version soon with more puzzles!
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Another excellent movie rental through Amazon online.  Great picture quality.  I thought it might be geared toward the younger generation but, this is an adult movie.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Ok, i wanted a challenging game to test my skills. i got a game that a baby could do.<br />I could do this in my sleep. My CAT could do this. im 10 and this was the easiest thing ever. i was happy i could win but  i was bored out of my mind!!! if you want to win, get this, but if you want something challenging, ignore this game search for something else.
0385342039|5.0|I've read all the Sophia Kinsella books and this book is her best one yet. The main character Lara, as always, is scatterbrained and in some predicament. Her great aunt Sadie who has just passed away visits Lara but is now a ghost. The relationship and bond these two form, makes this book become a quick page turner. At one point, I was in tears, and that's never happened while reading a book. I highly recommend buying this!

B004SOR4H6|4.0|Ever since I got it, this app has been working perfectly. Then I decided to change my profile picture and things turned bad... it changed but now it blinks on and off no matter what I try!! idk what happened!!! its very frustrating.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game of strategy. All around fun to play. I have had no problems with this app. Would recommend you try it!
0345803485|5.0|I have read the whole trilogy. And I luv'd every page of every book. I couldn't put it down. I think it had a great story plot, and u get a sense of the characters as real people. The jump off the pages and come to life. It has lots of sex in it, but of course it's about a dominant of BDSM. The beginning of the third book starts off a little slow, but becomes great. Just read it and form your own opinion. And if you want to read some real eroctica try Eric Jerome Dickey's \\"Pleasure.\\" Bottom line you won't regret reading this book. I think I may read the whole trilogy over. ;)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app puts me to sleep every night. as if I were a baby!!!  now that j have it I have a feeling illnnever stop using it.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|This is a somewhat modified version of the full site, but really quite effective. The convenience of taking eBay where ever I go is great. I now have the added flexibility to not only search, but to also monitor any bids that I have in process or those on my personal watch lists. Check it out!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|works great on my kindle fire.  recommend this one.  challenging games.  click on (?) to get instructions for each game.  unlock. games to get to rest of game pack.  will keep you (and your kids)  busy for.hours.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|I expected to enjoy this album, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how much.  To my prog-rock listening ears, I could detect not only Yes (which you'd expect), but also a hint of Genesis (Phil Collins years) and a dash of Alan Parsons thrown in for good measure.  Moody and atmospheric at times, hard-rocking at others, there isn't a bad song on the album.  I suppose this could easily have been a Yes project, but quite frankly I thought it was better than anything post-90125, and frankly Chris Squire's voice is easier on the ear than Jon Anderson's (sorry Yes junkies, I enjoy Anderson's voice, but it can ascend to sappiness pretty quickly).  Hackett's guitar is understated for the most part, but you do sense his influence throughout nonetheless.<br /><br />A must-have for any Yes fan, and the best non-Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel solo album by any Genesis member (sorry Tony Banks, you're a genius but your pop albums just don't quite live up to this).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games and graphics.  very easy to get lost in the games and lose track of time.  very easy to play and understand.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great character development. The show is surprisingly accurate to the book. Read the books watch the shows either way its awesome.
B0042U94UQ|1.0|I did not like the design and execution of the drawings.  I did not like the plot and found the movie boring.  I definitely would not allow children to view this movie.  I purchased the movie because I read some good reviews.  It takes all kinds of people to make a world and I am sure there are some people out there who liked the movie, but I wasn't one of them.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This product is not exactly what I thought it was going to be. I love the color, and the hard shell like cover for the back. The front of the folio cover is more flimsy than I would have thought. I still gave it three stars because I do like it, I just wish the front of the cover offered a little more protection.
0425263908|4.0|First of all, I read this type of book just for fun and am not looking for true to life reality<br />I really liked this book because the characters actually talk about their issues... eventually. Yes Eva and Gideon have constant conflict but there is not months of angst and misunderstandings.  Eva is overall not your typical overreacting female.  She can take a step back and look at their relationships dynamics. I am looking forward to the next book as it further reveals their story.  Definitely worth a read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've seen the movies, and know I'm living it! this game is really fun and easy. I love the kung fu scratch mini game!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|If you enjoy superbly written, fast moving books with compelling characters and story lines, then this is the book for you.  All I can say is that this book was impossible to put down.  Its just great.
0847830942|3.0|The book is about the developement of French bicycles of lesser known names. Small builders and one off bikes are the bulk of the excellent photographs. Don't expect a history of the well known brands. A large coffee table book. Fine - if you just want to enlarge a bicycle book collection.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|This is a terrible, childish, turd of a  book. I'm incensed that another adult human recommended this puerile garbage to me. Seriously, it's like Oprah, Dr. Phil, and Depak Chopra took a collective dump, named it Paulo Coelho, taught it to write, and then unleashed it on the world to spread its new-agey nonsense. The world is a little colder, and a little more dead because this man is alive and writing in it.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I have been a long time Offspring fan and this is one of the best albums they have put out for years.  The music is inspired and driving at times with hints of riffs from the Americana era for Offspring as well as hints of The Cult brought in with Bob Rock's influence.<br /><br />The songs that Offspring parady are just plain fun and they offer no apology for making you want to jump up and down and laugh.  Dexter really shows some very inspired writing on several of the tracks.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very solid and very enjoyable Offspring album. One of the best releases in 2012.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Not running around the house getting snacks, bathroom breaks, folding laundry, diverting myself from a poorly written movie. When i watched this movie it kept me in my seat all the way through.. great ending and kept me guessing throughout, awesome scenery as well.  Two thumbs up
B005LAIGIM|2.0|I looked forward to this movie when I heard about it but now that I've seen it, I'm sorry to say that it was a waste of time. Eddie Murphy basically played himself as usual, complete with melodramatic Jim Carrey-like hysterics that detracted from the story. Chris Curtis played a condescending, New Age guru whose smugness made me want to punch him out. The only likable character was Eddie Murphy's nerdy, awkward assistant Erin Wiseberger who was played by an admirably awkward Clark Duke.<br /><br />More importantly, the plot was completely unbelievable. Why would Murphy and the tree die? Wouldn't the tree simply grow more leaves?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director, screenwriters and Mr. Murphy wasted  a golden opportunity to make a funny and poignant film about listening and finding inner peace in a hectic and rushed world. Much better movies that explore these themes are Robert Redford's The Horse Whisperer, co-starring Robert Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas and Iain Softley's K-Pax, co-starring Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. I highly reccomend these beautiful and powerful movies over this failed attempt any day.

1466401885|4.0|Read on July 31, 2012<br /><br />  BOOK SYNOPSIS<br /><br />The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.<br /><br />Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs--and wants--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis's apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<br /><br />  My Thoughts<br /><br />Abby and Travis are two of the most tumultuous characters I have ever met between the pages of a book. Their relationship starts off with a bang and never slows down after that! I do not think my level of emotional exhaustion at the end of book has ever been as strong as it was when I finished \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", or my total contentment at how the story was resolved in the end either.<br /><br />Abby comes to Eastern University with the intention of getting an education and leaving behind the girl she used to be, changing her clothes, changing her demeanor and vowing to stay away from any and all tempting specimens of the male sex. Enter stage right the bad boy Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox, Abyy's good intentions one by one fly out the window as the two get closer and closer.<br /><br />A more unlikely to work relationship you will never find than Abby and Travis, the slight age difference in the two is no problem but their less than normal formative years have created two powder kegs waiting to explode and they are each others match!<br /><br />I concur with others who state that this book revolves around two main characters whose actions leave much to be desired, the over protective violence that Travis wreaks on pretty much anyone who so much as breathes wrong on Abby is not romantic but is instead a warning sign that should be heeded. The fact that Abby states over and over that she just wants to be friends and then blows up when Travis acts like a normal healthy male by involving himself with other females is another indicator that their \\"love\\" is not exactly one that songs should be written about.<br /><br />All that said and noted this story will still take you in hand and blow your mind at just how much you enjoy reading it, especially when the secondary characters like Abby's friends America and Finch are just so much fun to get to know.<br /><br />I think the kicker for me was when Travis first introduced Abby to his father and his brothers, their unconditional acceptance of her was something that brought her to tears as her own home life growing up had been one of heartache and misery. Thanksgiving celebration with the Maddox men cinched it! The other reason why this was a book that will live in my heart long after reading it is because the relationships between all the characters were honestly dealt with by the author, there was no sugar coating, the emotions portrayed were raw and gritty to the point of pain for the reader.<br /><br />In my mind this may be meant to be a Young Adult read but it is not one that I would ever recommend to anyone under 18, the sex scenes in the book while not belabored are still meant to be between consenting adults, the fight scenes are not too graphic but the violence depicted is very bloody and when Travis protects Abby to be quite honest sometimes his results are bordering on homicidal behavior. All in all this is a mature read which fits in Contemporary Romance category much more firmly than the YA camp it seems to havelanded in.<br /><br />I am a curious reader, this book was one that intrigued me when found it up for review on Netgalley and once I started reading it the book pretty much would not let me put it down until I reached the last page. It is easy to read as far as the author's writing, the themes that are explored in the story however are at times not so easy to read as they hit very close to home with a lot of us for one reason or another.

It is easy to read as far as the author's writing, the themes that are explored in the story however are at times not so easy to read as they hit very close to home with a lot of us for one reason or another.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was a really fun movie with great special effects and an emotional story too.<br />I have never read the books the movie is based off, so I came into it with a clean slate and no expectations.<br />It was very entertaining with both dramatic and humorous parts (Virginia!), and I walked out of the theater wanting to own it on blu-ray right then and there.  Well, now I do own it, and it looked and sounded even better in my home on my surround sound system.<br />The price was right on Amazon, and I didn't hesitate, and you shouldn't either, you won't regret it.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Okay, my skx009 review is pretty lengthy, therefore, I'll keep this one short. I discovered the joy of automatic watches, and Seiko is touted as a pretty good buy on an entire slew of watch forums, so I lept. Therefore, I also jumped when I fell in love with the 009 (pepsi dial). I wanted a different look to the 007, so I purchased the super oyster bracelet (also on Amazon from Strap Code). I chose the \\"super\\" because they are solid links, and have a hefty feel. I've posted a pic (image is a horrible attempt to replicate the Rolex Submariner image that can be found on the Rolex site) and this watch is now a true beaut with the oyster bracelet change! I have decided to purchase the super jubilee bracelet (on Amazon) to add more weight to the 009. A great watch that will likely outlive any other watch I own. Get it, you wont be let down.
0345803485|2.0|I bought this book because of the hype. I enjoyed parts of it but much of it irritated me. There are a few obvious errors, the dialog doesn't sound real and the biting of the lower lip was completely over done to the point of causing total frustration (for me, not Mr Grey.) However, I have no problem with the storyline not being credible, ie the multitalented billioaire that never seems to do a days work - it is a 'fiction' book after all. But when it came to the orgasms, I was left wondering 'what's wrong with me?' Ana despite never having touched herself (really?)....can do it at the drop of a hat. It was just too far-fetched for anything not in the fantasy genre. I quite enjoyed the world of Christian Grey but the chances of a man like this on this planet, is unlikely (unless he's Batman of course!). It would also benefit from a good edit - it was about 100 pages too long.  So far, I'm not remotely interested in reading darker or freed but it's possible my curiosity will get the better of me. My verdict - worth a go if you're not excepting much, but borrow rather than buy.
0143120530|5.0|I enjoyed it so much. Highly recomended to those who want to go to history and present of memory. Learning how to memorize all and keep thinking about it usefull in the present and future.
B007NR9WBG|4.0|\\"Brainstorm\\" is one of those great early eighties film classics that many of us were waiting for on Blu-Ray.  For the longest time, I've been waiting for some of my favorite earlier films to get the High Definition treatment. Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood together in a Sci-Fi about experiencing and altering dreams. Even seeing death through the recorded dream state of a person who has died.<br /><br />Just in the past month, Warner Brothers Video has released this film, plus \\"Altered States\\" (1980), \\"Outland\\" (1981), \\"Coma\\" (1978), \\"Hard To Kill\\" (1990), \\"Chariots of Fire\\" (1981), \\"Frequency\\" (2000), and with more to come. And soon we'll see \\"The American President\\" (1995) and \\"Dave\\" (1993), and so on.....<br /><br />I recognized that Warner Brothers Videos are suddenly shooting them out because on DVD they were released in those cheaper looking snap cases instead of the standard DVD holder.  So with that in mind, I hope Warner Brothers Video will soon release some of my other earlier classics like Paul Newman's \\"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\\" (1972), \\"Westworld\\" (1973), Steven King's \\"Cat's Eye\\" (1985), \\"Police Academy\\" (1984), Cannonball Run II\\" (1984), Cindy Crawford's \\"Fair Game\\" (1995), The Whole Nine Yards\\" (2000), etc.<br /><br />Thank you Warner Brothers.  Keep them coming!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use my Kindle to read and listen to Pandora.  I've come to depend on the customizeable talking notifications.  I don't even glance at the original battery indicator.  I also find the graphic representations indispensable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is hands down my new fave app.  theres so many different animal families to add and you are constantly collecting coins so you can add on and expand.  I definitely would recommend this to everyone.
0061733199|5.0|It arrived a bit earlier than expected, which is nice. It's in great condition and exactly what I asked for. It's just a little bigger and heftier than I originally imagined it to be. Still small, just not as much as I thought. Still a GREAT product though!
B007MG360G|5.0|Get it to school for cool no contest. Best game ever placed three times the charm still going strong get it now
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I can understand some people's criticisms, but overall I enjoyed this book. It was a fast read, though nothing earth shattering, it held my interest until the end. Bought this book at the local half price books in good condition.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it. Very accurate. I would recommend to everyone. Check this before leaving the house. Also use when school starts so my son can dress accordingly.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Holy cow. my mouth went dry. I bit my lip. I rolled my eyes. I don't how many times I wanted to rip my eyes out of my skull after reading the phrases over and over and over again!!!!! The plot was also the boring same-old every book, save yourself and don't waste your life on this series!
0920236251|1.0|Like other reviews I was expecting a full size paperback book. It's a mini version and since I have read the book and love it very much I didn't read the reviews that warn this is a tiny book. It should be a lot less money for how little this thing is. Did I mention it's small?!...ugh!!!
B0082LUEW8|2.0|After 5 runs through this new release I put the cd away and possibly will never listen to it again.  It seems slapped together just to get something new out.  Loud yes, however; lyricly weak and not the Hellyeah I have grown accustomed to and love.  They stepped in a big Texas pile of s**t with this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|luv it<br /> I would play this game all day long if I did not have a<br />life . I play this game every night.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun game to try and unlock new games and play your favorites and at the end there are secret games to play
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I wanted to  give it 4 stars, but it is missing this one very important feature.  Until  they correct  this, I'll look for other options.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I don't know what this app is like but I was wondering how it works on kindle fire.<br />ebay is awesome
B007SGM084|5.0|Did not think I would like this book. Was under the impression this was a mild pork book. Not the case at all. Very well written. Couldn't put it down. I hope there is<br />more to come.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is so fun. better than any I have used so far! enjoy racing the timer and the variety of patterns!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful app. I find it fascinating the way I can view my Kindle's energy usage via graphs and whatnot. Helps in my efforts to conserve battery.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run was a great app when it was only on apple but now its on amazon I cant stay away from it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am having a blast with this game.  It is fun and entertaining for everyone. I recommend it to children and adults both.  Download it and let the fun begin!!!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key is a holocaust story told in the present and during the German occupation of France.<br /><br />The author does a great job of knitting together the story of Sarah, a 10 year old girl during the roundup of Jewish families in occupied France and Julia, a writer, who is researching the Velodrome d'Hiver roundup.<br /><br />The book may be a little predictable but there are some genuinely heart wrenching scenes. I recommend it.
1594203059|5.0|Prof Ferguson wrote this book how the West dominated the rest for the past five hundred years.  He listed six powerful concepts to show how and why.  It is thought provoking to read history and enables reader to think how the West and the Rest will go next.<br /><br />It looks now the rest download the application and is catching up, notably the Asian Tigers.  However, the Middle East is the area that will be the focus of Huntington's model.  It seems Prof Ferguson refers to West, meaning WASP, not the Spanish speaking Catholic Amigo.<br /><br />In many pages, he talked about Red China in Africa who undercut the West in recent years.  As a matter of fact, they had been there since 60s.  His over simplified Chinese history on Christianity to China needs some elaboration.  Jesuit Matteo Ricci came for good cultural exchanges.  But the Pope, a foreign entity interfered cultural internal affair of honoring Confucius and ancestors known as Rite Controversy which led to expulsion (P.278). Robert Morrison came and worked for Opium smuggling British East India Company and advised the British government demand extra-territoriality - meaning foreigners not subject to Chinese laws and court. On Boxer Movement, it is over simplified to say xenophobia.  Why Boxer picked on the agent of God, preaching agape?  Maybe Confucius teaching \\"Do not do onto others what you do not want to be done\\" is better. He mentioned Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic 1911, a Christian, who in his later years harshly criticized the missionaries (see Wikipedia). President Chiang and Madam Soong Mei Ling were Christians and failed miserably in disgrace and corruption.<br /><br />It is fun to see the world dress in western style of Levi jean, speak English, sing hit song,dance rock and roll,  say prayer in Christian Church, drink coke with Freedom fry and burger, need western medicine to cure physical illness due to western meaty diet in an English Commonwealth. Do they want to lead a life rich but inadequate, powerful but no peace of mind ? Who will be the rest for the next 500 years?  This book stimulates to think for the future!
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy.  The 1st book had a lot of sex and unusual sex and continued in the next books.  But eventually the characters were developed, which caused me to continue reading to see why they behaved as they did.  I like the way the trilogy finished and was not disappointed in reading all three.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|This is hands-down the best Rush album in quite some time. CA contains all of the elements that die hards like me love about the band. Seven Cities and the title track are probably my favorites, but Headlong Flight is also high on the list. I'd be even more infatuated with the album had I not listened to the first two tracks 100 or more times in the last two years.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|After releasing an album like this im still shaking my head that they were not included in the big four tour...Anthrax???? Are you kidding me???<br /><br />Possibly the Album of 2012.
