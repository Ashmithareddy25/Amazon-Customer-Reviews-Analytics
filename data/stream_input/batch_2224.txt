B0084U0IEG|5.0|After the very disappointing &#34;Solar&#34; I was happy to find that Ian McEwan is back on form in this one. A slow starter of a book but an excellent finish.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|This movie never gets old. All time bad ass movie. If you havn't seen it, you need to. Great movie.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I found this book very insightful and motivating. Though the book is written for writers, I think the ideas in the book would serve anyone embarking or stuck on a project.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Wonderful way to wrap philosophy and history into science fiction. I was never really a fan of sci-fi but I can't seem to put these books down fast enough!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Not his best but , hey, I think he's usually brilliant so that means a 4. Worth reading. Good old Rebus
B008BDZOZY|5.0|...you like David Byrne!<br />...you like quirky music!<br />...you don't listen to mainstream music!<br />Really enjoyed the band and the harmonies.  Saw them on one of the late nite talk shows and liked the energy enough to buy the cd.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I chose this book on the basis of its introduction and was pleasantly surprised by the story, characters and quality of the writing.  It's an endearing tale and I was sad to leave the characters at the book's end.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|John Locke makes clear that he wrote this book simply to sell books. He virtually makes fun of anyone stupid enough to buy it. If he is the multimilliionaire successful businessman that he claims, perpaps he has a cadre of influencial friends that formed a starting point for people who would give his books five-star reviews. Most writers don't.  The book has limited application for most writers. JL wrote it for one reason: to sell it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|The only thing is, the ####ing app is always closing!!!!!!!!!! Otherwise, great app. I can get all of my videos on it. Cool!!
B002OR18HQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed John Fogerty's \\"Long Road Home\\" DVD.  As a huge fan of both him and his former group CCR, when this \\"Concert at Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD was released, I got it too.<br /><br />This is a good performance and certainly features several classic hits of John's, but my chief complaint is that John seems a little more stiff than he does on the \\"Long Road Home\\" DVD.  The music rocks and the band seems tight enough, but I kept wanting John to loosen up a little.  The end of the concert is better than the beginning in that regard.  It could be that he needed some time to warm up.  He interacts with the crowd less here than on the \\"Long Road Home\\" DVD, and he appears to not be as \\"into it\\" overall.  I'm guessing that possibly the size of the venue attributes to that in some degree -- \\"Long Road Home\\" (I think) was filmed in a smaller venue than the Albert Hall.  I can't blame John for that one -- still it would have been nice if he had been a little more open and free in his playing.<br /><br />A huge CCR / Fogerty fan will want to have this and \\"Long Road Home\\" together.  But if you're choosing between the two, \\"Long Road Home\\" is easily the better choice.
B000NI9UMS|5.0|Great plot, costumes, music.  Beautifully done.  Took great pains to accurately design the sets.  Accurate hiistorical portrayals.  This is a movie which can be watched, and listened to, countless times.
B000002UY5|5.0|Great, quickly arrived, great shape.I liked it a lot.  Why do I have to say so many words to submit to this thing??  I liked it!
B009369Z8A|5.0|In my view this movie is a &#34;must see&#34;.  Keeps me interested and it moves along with great acting and suspense.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Very slimline case that fits perfectly in your purse or pocket.<br />It has the added benefit of keeping the headset safe and secure from damage or loss.<br />This is a must-have accessory for the must-have Legend Bluetooth headset.<br />The case is perfect for charging the headset when traveling or when you are on the go around town.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Purchased for granddaughter's birthday .  It has cracked on corner.  Needs to be replaced.  Very disappointed in this product.. but hope LifeProof or Amazon will replace it. She has only used it for four weeks and it was advertised as a protection for her phone instead it breaks. Guess we are stuck with a defective product.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is a pass the time game. Watch for bombs. Keep trying for the best.. Hack  your way.. Watch where your hands are.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent read, a real eye opener.  I'm halfway through my second read.  There's a whole lot more in that bagel than you would ever imagine.  Read this for your health, safety, longevity and obviously the cause of your belly fat. You'll never look at bread the same way again.
B00122IYJY|4.0|This is their debut album and I consider one of their best.  The guitar work, while not a breakthrough, presents a solid style that many guitarists have attempted to copy since.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Quality CD and the price was right. Bought this before she won all of her awards and when she did I understood why and was happy for her.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|John C. Riley is great in this movie. My son and I loved watching it and seeing all the old time video game personalities
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|it gives a number of different layouts but some of the tiles are very similar and on a small device that could be a problem,  would like a little more choice
0440246008|5.0|Lee Child is a wonderful writer. I love all his books and was able to find all of them in one place<br />How cool is that!!!!!
B003ULUASS|5.0|So hard to find quality vinyl records today with all the CD's and MP3's that are trying to push out this musical format.  The Vinyl pressing on this will crush any CD or MP3, try it and feel like you are seeing Katy Perry live!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I just love dancing in every form and this particular one has so much energy that I could not sit still at the movies when I watched it originally.....I have not as yet watched the DVD but I am looking forward to watching it at home and enjoy it more fully without  feeling  as though I could be annoying persons sitting around me......<br /><br />If you love dancing and particularly if you enjoy Latin American rhythms you are truly going to love this movie.  I have also purchased, in he past, the other previous movies in this genre and loved them as well, but this one I found is exceptional.<br /><br />S.Bastas
B0086700CM|2.0|I don't like this type of games. It isn't what I thought it was. I thought it was a different card game.
044024630X|5.0|Lee Child is a wonderful writer. I love all his books and was able to find all of them in one place<br />How cool is that!!!!!.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is TOTALLY EPIC! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!  I highly reccomend it. It is the coolest game EVER!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I read some very favourable reviews and I was not disappointed with the movie, the actors and the story line but in the end I passed it over to one of my godsons who is now 15 and has fallen in &#34;love&#34; for the first time and I thought it would be more appropriate and enjoyable for him.......and I was correct......he did enjoy it very much.<br /><br />S.Bastas
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I would like for the ending to leave you encouraged that it will be a happy outcome.  Just too depressing.
044024367X|5.0|Lee Child is a wonderful writer. I love all his books and was able to find all of them in one place<br />How cool is that!!!!!..
B008Y73940|5.0|this is Matthew McConaughey at his best.  I like that the movie is filled with suspense.  Matthew basically got his client off and convicted him at the same time, but he deserved it.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|Hard to maneuver and understand how to send a message to someone. Need better tutorials on how to do things in the system.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Fun it is awesome my cousin has the video now I have the game he is going to be happy
B005ARYEPK|5.0|This is an old DVD From many years ago. After I saw the current movie , I had to order the older version to compare.
B000FC12C8|5.0|Must read for anyone who would like to be an &#34;Intelligent Investor&#34;.  Read it and learn the right way to invest.
B001KL3GZO|4.0|As a kid I was introduced to jazz not long after this came out and owned a couple records from this period of Miles's career - late 50s to early 60s, prior to the advent of the Tony Williams lineup. My favorite was Round About Midnight which features a lovely version of Bye Bye Blackbird in addition to the Thelonious Monk title track. Kind of Blue is a deservedly famous album, one of Miles's best, but I get sick of the 'greatest record ever' hype and the never-ending flow of remasterings, each puportedly higher res - and more expensive - than the last. Also, jazz marketing has always suffered from an excess of posturing and pseudo-intellectualism, comparing the music to Zen Buddhism and Einsteinian relativity and the Orgasm. The liner notes to KOB are not short on such beatnik kitsch. Poo. The music is really nice whether or not it bears any relation to Japanese finger painting. Also, if you really want to hear this album to best advantage find an old vinyl lp. The zillion bit remasterings always boost the highs to the point where they are irritating. The lineup is not ideal. Cannonball Adderley and Coltrane together are too much. It would have been better to use one or the other. Despite Bill Evans's greatness I think I prefer Red Garland with this group. I won't trash Jimmy Cobb. Compared to Philly Joe he was never much on fills but has a terrific beat - he's my man. Apart from Round About Midnight, either of the Carnegie Hall sets are as good as KOB in my opinion, or better, depending on taste. The earlier one features Hank Mobley on tenor, Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. It's a fantastic set even though the personnel are not as illustrious. The later set features the group with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams and they are truly electrifying. Anyway, I encourage everyone to go out and get a copy of Kind of Blue but there are a number of other albums my Miles - including a couple with Coltrane - that are arguablyas good.
B00136Q342|5.0|I grew up listening to Johnny Cash all the time. So I was glad to buy this when I saw it for the price. I recommend this to anyone who likes country music.
0062238868|5.0|This book is amazing. It tells the story of a wonderful man. My son called and said I want this book,<br />I told him I knew just the place to get it... And I did, I had it within days. impressed!!!!!
B0025T6EY0|5.0|These first episodes are classic and will never be replicated. As the series becomes more popular, the content changes most likely because the audience changes, the word gets out that their is nudity, drugs, drinking, and lots of sex and once this word spreads the idiots who do not know how to change a channel if they find something offensive start bitching at the network to change or tone down the content. Anyway - always enjoy the first 3 they are the original and the best.
B001TH44VY|3.0|If you are in no hurry, I'd get the DVD so it can be viewed later too. I was OK with this web-based movie since I got to view it right away, and I can view it again, just can't view it on my TV set
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app it is so cute it is a have to buy app it is good for kids 9 and under its fun having your own town. BUY IT.
0440243688|5.0|Lee Child is a wonderful writer. I love all his books and was able to find all of them in one place<br />How cool is that!!!!!  love Lee
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Turned the main character into a wimp. No one wants to read about a heroine who spends nearly the entire book in a hospital bed. I don't care what happened to her. Doesn't make for a good read.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|There are not enough scifi dystopian  shows/movies  in  the world.  Great show on  a budget, just  hope  it lasts a while.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I cannot stop playing this addicting and awesome game. the graphics are awesome and this game is great for all ages.
B007SGM084|5.0|Can't wait till the next one!!! Christian story will be very interesting and will fill in the holes that these books didn't fill.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My whole family loves this one. My kids are ages 6-13 but my younger Nieces and nephews play it with<br /> no problem!  Lots of fun for anyone :)
B001ANSSDC|3.0|With all the award nominations and acclaim that the movie which is based on this book has received, I had high expectations for this book.  Sorry, but I was not impressed.  I like to read the books that have movies made from them before I see the movie because generally the book is better.  So, I haven't seen this movie yet.  Maybe my general rule will fail me this time, we'll see.<br />The writing did not seem particularly interesting and the story seemed predictable, ordinary and rather shallow.  I've read many other books that held my attention and had more interesting characters.  It was an OK read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome game and I think they should make more I play it everyday I enjoy the challenge and the graphics are awesome  and i hope that many people are happy about it too
B008458O3S|5.0|Very challenging game for puzzle lovers!  Great satisfaction when you solve a difficult track layout!  I can't wait to see what's coming around the bend in the next level!
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Had to get this classic in the Blu-Ray version.  Such an awesome story!  If you havent seen this yet, WATCH IT! and buy it on blu-ray as it gets a nice bump in visual quality.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is a  cool game it's  like temple run but has animals my favorite one is the<br />Platypus this is a awesome app it  is good for kids .
B00BHMF578|3.0|I'm not sure why everyone thinks this is such a great movie. It's more like the reenactment of an interesting story. The acting isn't anything special. I wasn't moved.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is ALWAYS there to give me a report on today's weather. Great app. I can get the weather report from halfway around the world. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|The only thing I dislike about this app is that if you leave the sound loud enough to hear your alarm, then it is too loud to sleep by the sound.... soft enough to enjoy the sound--- you can't hear the alarm.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love that I can find a large variety of apps for my andriod tablet. Have downloaded several app. Downloading is quick and easy
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I read the entire trilogy. Just finished this third book. This one felt forced and messy. Still very entertaining and with a good finish. He brings Salander's evolution to a good, final conclusion. But some of the writing and story telling got labored. Still, worth reading if you read the first two books.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This product was cracked when I got it. (Amazon gave me a replacement.)  It feels flimsy and cheaply made for how much it costs, and I would be afraid my phone would break. I honestly thought I had a fake one at first because it felt so poorly made. Waterproof feature is a nice bonus but you have to do periodic checks to see if it still is in fact water proof. Directions to apply the case and remove it don't come with the product, you have to look them up online. All in all I prefer my Otterbox. It may not be water proof, but if I drop my phone (which I do all the time) I know it's safe.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Such a wonderfully made unique movie for all ages. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. It gives \\"monsters in the closet\\" a whole new meaning.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It surprises me how these wonderful authors never seem to loose it. Their amazing ability to have readers so captivated, on edge, hungry for more even though they've had their fill. This is the second book I've read and I am not one bit disappointed,can't wait to read the third...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good graphics, story line, and level of difficulty.  If you get stuck you can always go to the map but, there are also prompts to help you.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|One of my all time favorite John Wayne movies!<br />John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, the good guys, battle against the bad guys, guess who wins?!?
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Well written ... History relived for me..  I was a flight engineer on a b-17 in world war ll.  I learned a lot about the German Air Force that I did not know previously.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My daughter loves this game and spent much of her time stuck in it. But there are not a whole lot of small games or anything inside of it so it winds up being the same thing over and over and gets boring.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The principles in this book offer the power to make real changes in your life. I can't recommend it enough.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Books have been written on the film...the documentary about the film is in some ways better than the film..no one would outside the US know who Randolph Hearst was!
0767812166|5.0|very satisfied with all purchases that I have made to date. will be ordering more in the very near future.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Storyline gets even better in the second book. It is definitely more fast paced and keeps you hooked. It explains so much more and really gives great back story. There is a whole lot of &#34;eureka&#34; moments. Totally worth every cent!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So glad this is on amazon prime.  It'a wonderful show and I'm glad there are lots more episodes to watch.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Best mission yet !! Cinematography, locations and actor/actresses choices were excellent.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a great story ans non stop action
1781163243|5.0|Great colors, good paper and sturdy book overall.<br />Lovely art and it shows very much of the process. If you are a fan of environment art (paintings) and the Halo franchise this is definitely a book worthy of buying!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I dont know why it took me so long to find out about this, but I am hooked.  I love the unbelievable story lines coming to life with the great background plot.  I cant wait until that becomes the entire show
B0084AXZK0|2.0|Im sure I will get vilified for writing this. But this is book is pretty boring. The central idea is quite clever. There is some of Oscar Wilde's wit but this classic is only a classic for the idea it presents. The method in which it is presented is poor and boring. I can see why many people have seen and like a movie of this. It would translate well into a movie (I have not seen any but know there are several) But as a read its dry and slow. At least for my tastes. Every person has different likes and dislikes.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I really enjoy the dynamic singing of this cast doing Les Miserables - There are 2 great CD's in this set!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a simple game of fitting all your groceries into a bag, and sometimes go rage on it and destroy everything!<br /><br />The game is light-hearted with lots of personality for each of the pieces you put in the bag. The group combos gives it an extra level of challenge.<br /><br />I reset my phone a few times for one reason or another, and I enjoy Bag It so much that I just keep playing over the game from the beginning, very well done!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I just got it (because it's free today) and soon I got the hang of it. I was going when I saw him I thought OH MY FREAKING GOD turned around and ran ( really walking). I had 7/8 no joke he went up 2 me and screamed NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! And sadly I was murdered. :(<br /><br />This is the best slender game out there buy it right.now!!
B0066W1AZK|1.0|do not by this app! I do not like this app! it is very bad! just do not by this app!
B006O6F932|5.0|my daughter loves this toy, is very nice and wonderful for kids since 8 years old. It is easy to play and save anywhere
0345525558|2.0|As didn't read, can't offer an opinion...mores the pity.  Perhaps it was the subject which did not entice me to read this book.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Maybe not the deepest movie out there but very good entertainment, enough to make me watch it twice, something I seldom do. On the other hand, not enough to make me buy it, only to rent it.
0375505091|5.0|We both have a photographer's interest in Annie so this made an awesome gift.  It wasn't the book she was expecting.
B00AHJXRS6|5.0|Fans of Riverside. Rush and Porcupine Tree need to discover this band.  Brilliantly produced, In Crescendo epitomizes what prog rock is supposed to be.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love listening to this cd in my car.  She just belts out the songs and makes the hair on my neck stand up.  There's not a lot of singers that do that to me and when they do I can stop listening.  I recommend this cd.
B005TZFZ9W|5.0|i am a love rap it is not even funny so this disc really helps love rap even more than i do
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Great plot, excellent interwoven story lines, strong characters -- flawed, but endearing heroes and brilliant yet ruthless villains. A really engaging read!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application is a Must Have for every user.  Keeps you informed of weather all over the country, near and far!
0385537816|2.0|I have read these books before buying this set. I love the books!!  But when I received the set, the cutting job of the paper and the placement of them in the binding was horrible! My 2 years old son could have done a better job with scissors.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|The app, is great, when it comes to things like, movement, and graphics to some degree, but Slender- Man is quite pathetic. You can literally watch him slide toward you, and during one walkthrough, he spawned and slid from the front of a sign, to the edge of the map, which is easy to see and walk to. It's not scary AT ALL. But, it's better than ANY OTHER slender game on the android. I'm still wanting &quot;Slender Rising&quot; -_-
1426308469|5.0|My grandson (4yrs.) played for hours with it and my (older) granddaughter (5 yrs.) kept interested looking  through the books I also ordered....Entertained  for hours.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this application.  If you want to check up on an item, at any time, this is the one for you!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|After getting close to the end, all that was left was Rainbow Dash, my daughter logged in and the<br />game was reset to level one.Spent some money but not alot so it was a bummer.  Until then she really enjoyed the game.  Sent in a customer request a month ago and have not had a response yet.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Although there were moments where the novels dragged I thought the overall trilogy was very well done and consistently kept me wondering-i don't think I'll find another trilogy to take its place
B008XNZMOU|4.0|This was a gift requested by a teen age girl so I know she is getting a lot of enjoyment out of it.
B0012C7ET0|5.0|If you are into Stevie Nicks this cd in my opinion is a collection of her best works ever I highly recomend this one
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An amazing story of a true American warrior. A book that is both engaging and emotionally evocative I would highly recommend this book to anyone but especially those who aspire to become America's elite, US Navy SEALs.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series is the best thing I have read in years! Please keep the story line going with Anastasia and Christian....
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have not read this yet but I know I will love it since I love all of John Grisham's books.
B001YXS7JI|5.0|As the cd name says, it's a collection of Dire Straits very best works, an absolut cd for any fan of theirs
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|What the It will not let me play. The app that I thought that it was the best but it doesn't work ahhh!!!!!!
B003AWRMCE|5.0|great clinton eastwood is fantastic his movie will make you stay awake to see the whole movie so 5 stars
B003EI2EH2|5.0|No BS advice to becoming stronger, faster, leaner, better in \\"the sack,\\" and much much more. Might be the best book I've ever read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Using this on my Kindle Fire. Takes a little more skill than other games I've played. Timing is everything wether sliding or gathing in coins. Most of my other games are word type games and decided to try an action game.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This product is great. It holds everything I need it to hold. It's great for when you are going out somewhere but it is also good for at home.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|i am into westerns a big fan the movie is great i went to stores here and could not find it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game js so much fun and so realistic some times the daily tasks disappear  ut other than that i find thiz game very fun.
078689136X|4.0|this book was written with more flow and was and enjoyable read. actually the only one of the series. I purchased the book form as I want to have them for my library but this is the only one worth keeping
B007MAETA8|3.0|I have lots of CD's by John Mayer this CD has a few good songs, but over all CD is not scratched and plays very well.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The story is written from the perspective of the inside of a damaged mans head as he recovers from a mental breakdown. He is childlike but compelling. I was surprised how much I liked it.
B001AP11KW|3.0|Not nearly as good as it was supposed to be. My unfamous Bow Thayer purchase was much better.Contrived and icy.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|The game's sound and graphics are great.  I was just really disappointed after all the hype I've been hearing about Slender Man.  How in the world is this game scary?
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I read the reviews and i was excited for a complex storyline and sweaty palms...silent hill was great. This was just not what I was expecting...the controls are nice and smooth, but it's so boring. You walk around picking up notes that are hard to read then you see a guy. You're like &quot;awesome, about time something happened.&quot; So you run up to the guy ready to dive into the story and then...you're dead. Please review this if you play it. I do not see how there are so many 5 star reviews. I'm gonna go delete this now.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was very fun. To play, I thought the graphics, sound and story line to be very entertaining.  I would definitely recommend this game to a friend.
B00005K9LM|5.0|this is probably my favorite Priest album. It's up there with Screaming. I played this cassette over and over again. But back in 1984 things were a lot darker in music and in your face and this was hanging out there by itself where nothing could touch it. big guitars and big production. Halford and the boys just delivered great songs. The melodies just stick out. I had hoped for the same with Turbo but it was a different time. If you never heard priest before. Crawl out from your rock, put your leather on and get this for your first experience. And then get Screaming, British Steel and Hell Bent for Leather.
B00338QENI|5.0|Skloot does a fantastic job explaining the science and the issues of medical ethics.<br />She also wonderfully relates the story of the Lacks family.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott's book has some great life lessons, too that I found myself thinking about as I completed long meticulous tasks.  When Scott finds himself inclined to write a second book, it will be an even greater book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Graphics are just like the Pc. Game is real not pictures and. Best slender game for android. Also. It has different settings then just a forest
B0063GORYU|4.0|Works just like the computer version and it is free! I like the choice of background and card colors.  Thanks for making it free.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Odd graphical issues on my rooted Evo3d didn't effect gameplay just a little distracting though if they fix it 5 stars. I was playing with my daughter next to me and she told me she was scared so game was doing it's job.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This is a very rare special mini masterpiece.  I've heard virtually every top 100 album on Pitchfork and Metacritic, and this album blows virtually everything away.  The gall of these youngsters to go so over the top like Queen, the Beatles, The BeachBoys, Jelly Fish and even Vampire Weekend.  To tap into the Carpenters and all that over indulgent piano, orchestra and harpsichord 70s rock tropes is just gorgeous fun triple scoops of sugar pleasure.  The Beatles got away with indulgence, why not Fun?  And of course you cant miss the ELO references just about everywhere, with a little Elton John and Jellyfish<br /><br />What a brilliantly theatrical effort at knocking Queen out of the heavens this album is
B000K3M1VI|4.0|I have heard about Sophie's Choice since the movie was released twenty years ago.  I heard through many sources what her choice was, and felt at that time that I couldn't handle the movie.  I had a small child and the thought truly made me ill.  I cannot in my worst nightmares imagine what those years in Europe must have been like for so many millions of people.<br /><br />I think I expected more of a &#34;Schindler's List&#34; (which I also had not been able to watch until two weeks ago) type of movie filmed completely in black and white; and, more of a concentration camp filled movie.<br /><br />Sophie's Choice was different because it was about a beautiful Polish woman who had survived - physically- the horrors of WWII and was trying desperately to live a new life in the United States.<br /><br />I'm not going to say more about the movie because I really don't like it when people tell me the endings of movies I haven't seen and am planning on viewing them in the future.  Talk about spoiler alerts.<br /><br />What I will say is this movie is a different view of the lives of three people who lived through that horrendous time, all with different backgrounds, different stories that were their lives, and all with different outcomes.<br /><br />I highly suggest this movie.  Meryl Streep was as amazing as usual.  Kevin Costner, I feel, should have also won an Oscar for his role.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I think this game is very fun and good for little kids, and maybe even for older kids that like pets.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|And never has a eight year old been so right. Fun to play, adorable graphics, and keeps me occupied for hours.
B0091REZMW|1.0|me and my mom hate your game to much money to complicated don't buy it worst app ever if you bought it delete it or don't get it at all
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game, while it is fun and suspenseful, is not that scary. The goal of the game is to collect eight notes, but you must avoid the Slender Man, who is pretty much a faceless guy in a tux. He can be creepy, but not really scary. Either way, you should keep in mind that you should not play this if you are easily scared. Overall, this is a really fun game, and as the free app of the day, it is a must-have.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I love the amp on my Razer Electra headphone an JVC  Headphone Xtreme -Xplosivs. my friend love it to and is 20% cooler too.
B003GK212G|5.0|What a book!!!! This book had me on the edge of my seat. You had a little of everything in this one. Keep writing.
0062082353|5.0|Rest in Peace Chris. We will miss you for all of history. Thank you and your family. Rest in Peace.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I ordered this for myself in December of last year as a birthday present and I'm so happy I did. I loved Daria when it first came out and since there aren't any consistent places to watch reruns I was going through Daria withdrawal. I don't care that the original music could be used, the only point I ever really noticed was when they go to Alternapalooza but other than that it's not a big deal. I'm so glad that I finally have Daria: The Complete Animated Series to call my own :-)
B00AFEY354|5.0|Interesting, funny at times, and meaningful, too. Everyone has problems no matter what age. The actors were very good, too.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I'm reading this book at the moment. So far it's really good. Can't wait to get back to it and see what happens. Thanks for the joy of reading. I never have a dull moment when reading your books.
B00005R8FI|5.0|People are always surprised to hear this album.  It was during a quiet period in the Mayall history and never go the attention it deserved.  I think the prformance by Johnny Almond is an all time classic
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very entertaining series and is highly recommended. We plan to watch all the episodes for all seasons.
B000N6UERK|5.0|An exciting and interesting movie. Good concept. Very good acting. Had to watch this one very close to understand what was happening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game!!! I can play this game for hours!  The little girl I babysit loves this game!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|With so many shows screaming out, &#34;Me, Too!&#34;, trying to mimic each other with a similar series, this one stands out and is worth watching.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game was so cute! I love this game! Although I cannot get to Earth! I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is one of the most meaningful movies I've seen in a long time. Also, very interesting, very sad, very haunting, really makes you think. This movie tells the very desperate story of a family living in very harsh circumstances. In a strange way, it still depicts family loyalty. This movie is well worth seeing. Hard to watch at times. Jennifer Lawrence does a terrific job of acting. The whole cast is very good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie about the hostages who escaped when the embassy in Iran was taken over and how they got out of Iran.  Ben Affleck was great.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Have never lost interest in this show in all of the years I've been watching it.  Matt Smith brings traits of previous Doctors and makes his own character quite memorable.  Always looking forward to a new episode, and very much enjoy watching the past ones.
0061474355|5.0|I absolutely love this series! Had to buy another copy of this book after I lost the first one because I couldn't be without it on my book shelf!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it's so addicting you should try it although the things are expensive to buy try the game!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffer because the way u play and that game is different then anyother game that I play like l havent seen the way these character feel
B0087HT36U|5.0|Similar to Angry birds but different enough to be fun.  The whole family enjoys playing it.  Great time waster. Still can't get the gold crown on a couple levels.  :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lives shattered, broken hearts and minds, all of these feature so prominently in the book and in our lives. Captured and portrayed with accuracy and sympathy, along with all that is required to complete the series.  A sad but great read, and I am left heartsick and almost crying for all who survived.  Wonderful series.  Make time to read it.
B008B68IV8|3.0|Ghoulia is a pretty doll but the hair is gelled to much so I wouldn't get her because her hair can't move  like that if it is gelled to much.<br />The basket can't even put food in it and the doll doll came one day late.<br />She is new but Ghoulia Yelps Basic Travel doll is not a good doll.
B007US9NA8|4.0|good information, detailed info, pics, workouts, lots of good stuff. I would recommend this book for people wanting to get serious about working out or bodybuilding
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very well made app.Has Great graphics and sound effects.Fun for all ages. Got it as FreeApp of the day but would have paid for it; it is that good.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is fun, but the app sucks on my kindle. It freezes up way too much. Would be 5 star worthy if it didn't.
B00AVF8USS|5.0|My Favorite movie and now I have it to watch anytime.. Great when you are at an office visit or away from home.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|Quality of DVD is excellent, The story it self is good for being made in the 50's compare to today's movies the story is a little tame
B004UID2LC|3.0|it was a little slow but it was worth it. I wouldn't reccomend it though. it was ok I didn't really like it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|As a retiree, I found this movie very enjoyable and with some of my most favorite actors.  My family enjoyed it with me.
0307455874|4.0|I read his first book &#34;the dreams of my father&#34; and I like it so I bought this one because  the title is inspiring and so deep. BARACK OBAMA the best president ever
B000NQRE1E|4.0|I'm sorry I can't give you more information about this item - it is a good film - that's why I bought it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It took me a bit to get into it but once I did it took off.  Well written and enjoyable!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love it. Arrow is a great show.It is filled with action and drama.The story lines are great too.<br />I watch each episod at least twice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. Its so fun. I love to update it and the more it get updated the gunner it gets.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great movie. Very entertaining and fun to watch. I watched it on my Ipad while I lay on the couch.  The picture was clear and sharp.
B005I3PAUO|4.0|A good read that is fast paced in true Baldacci style. For me it missed the top mark because I have a problem with moments when the character seems defy gravity.<br />But certainly worth the buy on Kindle and helped pass time whilst traveling.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The end was a surprise and left the reader hanging. I am a Stephen King fan and feel that this one came up short to other KIng's writings.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Good story to read if you like murder mysteries with a little twist.  Fun characters - great setting.  Highly recommend reading all of them.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Love everything about it!!!  So amazing how it guess's every charactor I think of! It's so fun for pretty much everybody!!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|I love this movie and it is a glimpse into our past they way I remember it.  It is sad that we will never see this fine style of life, of relating honorably to fellow humans again in our society.  I always love the ice skating scene.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A REAL PAGE TURNER WITH INTERESTING  AND FAST PACED PLOT<br />I LIKE HIS POINT OF VIEW AND HIS STYLE OF WRITING.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  I love the language, the accents, the english manners, the posture, the relationships between family and servants. Glad to see Mary and Matthew have a baby but the last episode was a total surprise.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was Ok, did not make me too excited to maybe ever watch it again. ***** I could not say to see this.
B001XVD21Y|4.0|Leo DeCaprio was great in this movie playing an undercover plant in organized crime group. Matt Damon was the guy you loved to hate.
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]<br /><br />Every decade has a few films that define that age. Star Wars. Rocky. E.T. Point Break is such a film. An adrenaline filled, testosterone soaked action classic, Point Break came out during that small window in the early 90s when Gen-X came onto the scene.<br /><br />Keanu 'whoa' Reves is Johnny Utah, football player turned FBI agent who is as much a seeker as he is an investigator. Gary Busey of Lethal Weapon fame plays Reves' partner. Patrick Swayze is Bodhi, surfer-bank robber-philosopher who leads his own tribe of lost boys in robbing banks to finance their endless summer. There's a lot of discussion in this film about life, choices and what it means to be free. The surfer sub-culture is given a fair amount of respect. All of which raise the film above the standard action fair.<br /><br />Car chases,foot chases, parachuting and of course...surfing. All wonderfully directed by Katheryn Bigelow.<br /><br />The script has lots of quotable dialogue.<br /><br />'You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta' go down.<br /><br />'If you want the ultimate, you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price. It's not tragic to die doing what you love.'<br /><br />'Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.'<br /><br />I could go on.<br /><br />There was talk a few years back about a sequel. That won't happen now that Patrick Swayze has passed away.<br /><br />Pity.<br /><br />All in all, a very cool movie. See it if you haven't.<br /><br />And if you have, see it again.
B009HELT3C|4.0|The young agent K was really remarkable and the special effects were great and fun. These movies are so imaginative and original.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Layken's  and wills  love story is one of the most beautiful and realistic ones i read in long time. Colleen hoover draws you and and leaves you wanting more and more and more. I laughed and cried and felt every single felling they experienced.....I can not put into words how much i loved this book and i sure as hell couldnt put it down. I highly recommend it<br /><br />LOVED IT
B001A3GSFW|4.0|For the price it's a great buy. There's a couple of songs that could've been on this album that I feel were keft out. Other than that great album.
B000CNE092|5.0|I love Don Bluth! He really nailed it with this movie. Great characters, funny protagonist, epic villain, a lot of funny scenes, music is SUPERB, lots of drama too! Its not historically accurate at all and might offend Russians but aside from that, I love this movie!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. It has something for everyone and you will hum the songs for days.
B00003CXB4|5.0|One of the best openings ever, great characters, tortured protagonist, pure-evil antagonist, epic music, artwork is lovely, and each scene will shake you. Loved this movie as a kid and love it even more now! BUY IT!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma stone is a gem. This is a wonderful telling of The Scarlet Letter. It's funny and quirky and just all around a good time.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Definitely one of those movies you have to watch more than once... But awesome! Great acting, characters, story line, etc. I really enjoyed it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|There are no words to describe the wonderfulness that is this album. I only knew the song &#34;I'm on top of the world&#34; and bought it anyways. The songs are catchy and have great lyrics. This one is worth it.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This. Movie. Is. EPIC. Completely different from the original (and that's okay! Better even!) but it owns! Great characters, great action, great character interactions and tension, CG and special effects were amazing... no complaints from me!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Every talks about Tegan and Sara and I am so glad that I sprung for this when it was on sale. It is so much fun with the 80's feel. its not what I was expecting but I loved it.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you don't consider the book at all, I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10. The story line is solid, great actors, heart-pounding action scenes, antagonists you love to hate, a relatable protagonist, great CG and special effects, etc. It really is a great movie! If you consider the book though, goes to about a 6.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't know where they could go in the second book.  I was hooked!  The drama built as the story unfolded, and I can hardly wait to read The Mockingjay as a follow up to Catching Fire!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome because there is many different blocks and the mode are easy toy should totally buy it
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The author's path to success delights me very much. But I find Wool itself only mediocre because the world and the characters it depicts are too inconsistent. The pacing is excellent but for me it was a bit spoiled by too many moments of saying \\"but wait, that doesn't make any sense\\" or \\"that doesn't seem like something that character would say/do\\".<br /><br />I suspect some of the things that bothered me may be side effects of the process of serialization, as (I assume) the author doesn't get to go back and revise earlier, already released sections to better support later parts. In any case, Howey writes very well and I look forward to more of his work.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|i cant make this app work my invitory will show up and i can edit it  and it says it saves and when i open minecraft my original i cant make this app work my invitory will show up and i can edit it  and it says it saves and when i open minecraft my original invitory is back
B005723JSQ|4.0|Like most of her books, the story is a little over the top, but also entertaining and fun to read.  Good book for the beach or lazy weekend.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Reading this book made me want to count my blessings! Such a tough life for this sweet little family. Would recommend!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|As is common with muse albums, it is all over the place, good singing, good rock, then some dubstep for fun. I love the Unsustainable songs for their use of the definition of entropy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book.  The suspense is killing me to find out what happens next. June can't come fast enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and exciting game. I recommend this game. Its just like Temple Run but with a few twists. get this game.
1423140591|5.0|This is the second in the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan. This is a novel about the trials Percy faces after Minerva takes away his memory and drops him into a hostile Roman camp. Percy must then fight his way through the ranks and make new friends along the way. Riordan weaves a magical story in this novel with Greek and Roman mythology sprinkled throughout. The language is not very hard to comprehend but is engaging enough for older readers to be drawn into Percy's fantasy world.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|A great movie that is sure to inspire fathers everywhere. This heart warming story is sure to bring families closer together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those books that you are anxious to keep reading but at the same time, you don't  want it to end. It was a great book to savour.<br /><br />I have mentioned the book to many people. Some are not interested in Sci Fi. But, I tell them that it is good just for the mystery and suspense.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Howey!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Great game to play and just to pass the tike. Presonly I think it is the best angry bird game to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 2 is one of the best apps I have on my kindle! Also Temple run 2 is much better than the original temple run! I reccomend this app to everyone and anyone that wants just a fun game to play
B008MA83HC|5.0|I LOVE Mana!  This is a great collection of their hits.  It's upbeat and soothing at the same time.  Great band!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|get it you wont be disappointed. it is the greatest game i have ever played ever. im just saying this to get the sequel
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great show. Love the premise and the characters. Still working on Season 3, but plan on finishing it within 2 weeks
B0013F1D02|5.0|If you need a spot of adventure, magic, and romance to lift your spirit and warm your heart, this is one of the best movies in a long time to do just that. It's a grand story with colorful characters in a voyage of exotic locations and joyful discovery. It's simply a wonderful movie you can come back to again and again.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|I enjoyed The Long Walk. I found it to be thought provoking and entertaining. A look into the minds of many who experience the same event.
0143120530|5.0|It is interesting that Moonwalking with Einstein is not a how-to book. As what Foer said, it is not a self-help book. The book is a non-fiction but reads like a novel. The purpose of the author is to improve people's memory. However, he does not just simply introduce how people should do but in a manner that is much more captivating and informative - Foer tells his journey of winning the U.S.A. memory championship from a freelance journalist without any memory expertise. Along the way, he paid visit to the groups of people that we know little about, like mental athletes for memory competitions, people with extremely poor memories, and people who never forget. He kept revealing fun facts about the particular groups of people and explained the science around them, which make the book entertaining and practical. For example, in the book chapter four, Foer visited an old man, EP, said to be the most forgetful person in the world. His memory is so destroyed that he \\"doesn't even remember that he has a memory problem.\\" (Page 73) Through his visit to this friendly old man, Foer thoroughly teaches the readers the science around this unusual case. He brings the concept of psychological time and develops the theory that \\"monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it.\\" (Page 77) It is pleasurable to go through Foer's journey of memory and absorb knowledge about it, instead of just being told what to do to improve memory.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|awesome and inspiring series.I hated that the last season rushed the characters to conclusion; however, it was a great series
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have probably read this book 3 or 4 times since owning it. Yes as some people say a lot is common since but really life gets so busy that sometime you need a reminder. And I can honestly say I never stopped and thought &#34;O maybe the reason I dont feel loved is because.... or maybe my husband isnt feeling loved&#34; This book helps keep us both on track. If your a no it all then dont worry about spending your money but if you truely care for your spouse and just want to see that your not alone or want to learn a different way to express your love this book is worth ever penny
B00A5052YE|5.0|What an amazing album! She always impressed me how every album has it's own signature<br /> with Alicia's unique sound. I was  inspired with her words and happy she brought the changes in her life to the album. LOVE IT!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read the books! the movie is nothing compared to the book. I am really glade I read this trilogy before the movie was made. The movie is good but the books, as always are way way better.
0307719774|5.0|These took a little longer to get here than wanted but I did order several for gifts. This journal is such a great gift for family or special friends...it makes journaling easy! It also gives you an opportunity to look at how how you answered questions from previous years. It's really fun to share with my 19 yrs. old daughter!
B007SGM084|3.0|I couldnt wait to read this trilogy and all though its good its not great. I couldnt really loose myself in the book, there was a lot of slow parts, it just took me for ever to read because I just couldnt get into it and was glade when I finished the trilogy. If you want hot and steamy I suggest the sleeping beauty trilogy
B005GFPZYK|5.0|the book is amazingly detailed and tells you about combat and sniping in combat, it talks about Kyle's life and his family's difficulties
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It boggles the mind trying to comprehend why this series wasn't renewed.  If you like science fiction, this is top notch stuff.  Funny, witty, and cleaver.
B000E991HA|4.0|Have always love Charlize in this movie. So stylized and carefully designed, from the costumes and backdrops, to the acting styles of the characters. Story is even ok....
B009EJSUBY|5.0|Yes, Van Cliburn will be sorely missed.  I was fortunate to have attended three Cliburn concerts.  In Pittsburgh, he did the Rachmaninov 2nd; in Philadelphia, The Tchaikovsky 1st; and in Toledo, Ohio, The Grieg A-minor.  They were all memorable performances.  Now all of these gorgeous works, and many more beloved pieces from the Romantic piano repertoire, can be heard from this album collection.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer, who said that Van Cliburn had a \\"relaxed virtuosity.\\"  One is not constantly reminded that he or she is listening to Van Cliburn as a performer.  Instead, the listener is enjoying good music.  He was a musician first, who happened to be a great performer.<br /><br />The recordings are very good.  The piano comes out clearly.  I will definitely be playing these discs a lot.  They are worth the price.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual I was hooked from the beginning and finished the boom in two days. Loved it! I can't wait for the next Reacher book to be done.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Read, read, read, read, read. Interesting if disturbing. Good book to read in order to keep the mind sharp and your point of view relevant.
0307352153|5.0|Great book. Clearly explains why introverts are not just shy people and they it is all about how people respond to stimulus differently and how we energize. Lots of talk in non-academic terms about the science over the years, especially recent year, about the difference in how it all works. Looks at the impact of how our extrovert focused world has undermined things for those who quite often are the most creative among us. Open work spaces, group projects, rewarding outgoingness instead of actual productivity and success. The world has catered to the belief by some that the super extrovert is the best sales person and everything is about selling yourself these days and this book puts that belief in its proper place.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Easily one of the best I have read in a long time.  Rothfuss has real talent.  I can't wait for the 3rd book.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|It's most certainly worth the money, it's also cool how you go through a portal into the dark forest (by the way it's hard to survive in the forest) it's as good as temple run 2 and it has great graphics, the only reason I rated it four stars is because it failed installing twice, but I would have rated it 4.7 if I could, I would suggest buying it you will LOVE IT. P.S. I've been hearing from people that the dark forest isn't working, my only suggestion is to uninstall the application and reinstall, then never download the dark forest, sorry that you will lose your progress (Note I have not tested this it is only a idea) I hope this helps you.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Not real crazy about the story line.  I have watched this with my grand daughters age 3 and 5 about eight times.  They are thoroughly entertained.  The cartoon artistry is amazing.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Touching, \\"real\\" and satisfying. An interesting story. Genuinely talented cast. Cinematography does what it should--adds to the story telling without distracting the viewer from the story itself.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars!  I learned things that I didn't know and I really appreciated that.  I liked how the story went back and forth from when Henrietta was alive to when Ms. Skloot was going through the process of gathering information for this book.  Even though this was a required reading for my class I would recommend it to everybody because I'm sure they will learn things they didn't know with this book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a great book.  I also have it in hard back and intend to keep the whole set.  Can't wait for the third book to come out.  I am reading the second book now.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game can be very addictive!  I suck at temple run, so I thought this would be a simpler alternative.  Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm not swiping my finger correctly or what but the game won't cooperate.  Sometimes it will freeze up.  I'm not sure if it's because I play in areas that don't have wifi or what but if they can fix that small glitch then I would love this game.
B001LF347E|5.0|I intend or order all five season.  I am sad that it is going off the air in May.  I am a loyal fan and watch every one.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|My father was in Belgium and France during WWI in the US Army Engineers.  I was almost 4 when WWII began.  Although we were constantly learning of American setbacks as well as successes, all we young boys learned how important it was to be a \\"good soldier\\".  But no matter how much I pleaded, Dad would never discuss his experiences in WWI.  Once, when I had an accident that almost ripped my ear from my head, the doctor assured me that I would be a \\"good soldier\\" if I would let him sew my ear back in place without numbing it.  That was very important, even at the age of 5.  I said ok and never uttered a whimper during the entire procedure.  An added bonus was my vow to become that understanding, compassionate man.  I never wavered in that conviction, became a doctor and entered the US Navy where I became a flight surgeon.  Sledge's book graphically showed me the horrors we young boys escaped.  Sledge's book took me where my father never would--and made me understand just why he wouldn't.  Thank you.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Loved this movie! I had heard so many good reviews about it that I had to get it for myself.<br />Haru is just an ordinary girl who one day saves a cat. This cat turns out to be a prince, and his father, the Cat King, bestows many rewards (such as mice and cattails) on her, which she instantly regrets. When she accidentally consents to joining the cats, she goes to the Baron for help. From there, a whimsical journey and chase take place.<br />I feel as though a lot of girls can relate to Haru, and it's such a great growing-up story.<br />I recommend this movie to anyone who love magic, imagination, fun, and of course, cats.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Rating: 2.5 stars<br /><br />I remember reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower years ago. I'd guess 10 years or so. I didn't remember anything about the book really, but I did remember liking the book. I wanted to read the book again since they made a movie about it last year. Well, after reading the book again, I can say I'm not sure why I originally liked the book. Maybe my tastes have changed or something, but I found myself very underwhelmed by The Perks of Being a Wallflower.<br /><br />Charlie is a very emotional teenager (and by this, I mean he cries A LOT, not that he really has a wide range off emotions because he doesn't), though you aren't clued into why until the ending of the book (I'm assuming this is because Charlie himself doesn't know why). Instead of being able to connect with Charlie and understand his emotions, I found myself getting annoyed with him. I feel like I would have been able to sympathize with Charlie had I understood or at least had some idea of what was going on with him. Is Charlie autistic or did the childhood trauma make him the way he is? We're never given any answers. Since we're stuck with Charlie's detached narration, the book falls short. There are many dramatic events that happen, but I wasn't able to connect with anyone or care about the things that were happening. Maybe the book would have been better if it was written in third person.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I wasn't sure I wanted to write a review about it at all. I say skip the book and just watch the movie.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is truly one of those films that you have to be in the mood to question everything and anything. Good quality DVD and the packaging was in good condition upon arrival. Somehow the first package either got lost or my neighbors may now be enjoying it, but the seller promptly sent me another copy and I was more than satisfied with my service and product!
B001QWBM62|4.0|I haven't had as much time to play with this as I'd have liked in the week that I've had it, but I'm loving it so far.  I don't have much experience with recording (I did some fairly simple stuff using free software on my computer a number of years ago, and that's about it) but I was recording using the stereo mode on the H4n within a few minutes of getting it out of the box.  After that, things got a little more complicated.  This thing is packed with features and I think there's going to be a pretty steep learning curve as I figure out what all it can do and how best to utilize it.  It comes with what seems to be a pretty comprehensive instruction manual that I haven't had any trouble understanding so far.  It does seem to have been written by someone for whom English is a second language, but it's much better than many that I've seen.  With the help of the manual and a bit of trial and error, I managed to find the 4 track recording mode and record a short song with guitar, frame drum, flute, and riq parts, install the included Cubase software on my computer, import the tracks that I recorded into the software, and tweak them with some EQ and effects.  Next step will be doing a final mixdown and exporting it as an mp3, hopefully later today.  :)<br /><br />The only reason that I only gave the H4n 4 stars is because the user interface is a bit clunky and hard to navigate.  It's getting easier as I learn my way around and get used to using the side scroll wheel and buttons, but I've been spoiled by touch screens.  I sometimes find myself poking at the screen on the recorder out of sheer habit.  Hopefully the next generation of recorders will incorporate touch screens with more intuitive user interfaces.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend the H4n to anyone else looking to experiment with home recording.  It's a very versatile little device.  If you're looking for something for one specific application, you may be able to save some money by getting a more specializedrecorder, but if you want something that does a little bit of everything, the H4n seems to me to be a great value.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is scathe but I beat it on hard go ahead try for yourself just remember NEVER look back and RUN like a BOSS!!!!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I have not gotten very far in this game yet, but I am really enjoying it so far. I am playing the free version and plan on buying the full version.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game is super awesome!!!! The graphics are amazing and your surroundings change the farther you run! The only thing I don't like is that you can only play as one character. The game is also similar to Temple Run 2-which is free. I still love this game, though.
B00BESM14U|4.0|I would recommend this movie to all of my friends that lived through the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />The acting was fantastic and the story line seemed so real......<br /><br />I felt like I was back in my teens, doing crazy stuff and getting away with it!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I chose a five star rating because as use it was very good read and I enjoy reading it I would recommend it to everyone
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Sandler's cast with many of his buddies from prior films which makes this a good watch for anyone. With these voices, including Kevin James, David Spade, Andy Samburg, Molly Shannon and Cee Lo Green as the Mummy, it's full of laughs.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This was an awesome book. The only bad part is it ends HORRIBLY. Leo says, \\"Let's save somebody.\\" Then it's over!! A great cliffhanger,but then you have to buy the next book, which I can't find on the kindle store. BUMMER!  D:<br />  Also, if you see other reviews during that this book crashes on kindle  and e readers, they have fixed that problem.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After the blissful experience that is Kid A/Amnesiac I was actually happy to hear some rock music on their follow up to that period.  Some have criticized this LP for being disjointed or feeling less cohesive than other Radiohead efforts.  While I can see where they are coming from, this is still one of my favorite Radiohead albums.  I actually don't think there is discontinuity on here.  I read that the band felt they should have left a few songs off this record and shortened it up (specifically a video I saw with Ed and Colin and then a print interview with Thom).  And yeah, I suppose that tunes like &#34;We Suck Young Blood&#34; don't resonate with me like &#34;Scatterbrain.&#34;  But I am happy they left this album long.  I would hate to know which tunes they would have cut.  &#34;A Punch Up at a Wedding&#34; might not have made the cut and that's one of my favorite songs on this record.  I would even suggest that this is a good place for someone not familiar with the band's catalog to start.  Think about it, you get every single style of music in this band's incredible range, and you get some phenomenal tunes like &#34;Sail to the Moon&#34; (personal favorite) and &#34;2+2=5&#34; along with &#34;Myxomatosis,&#34; &#34;Go To Sleep&#34; and &#34;The Gloaming.&#34;  I mean what kind of world is not better with songs like &#34;Sit Down, Stand Up&#34; and &#34;There, There?&#34;  Not to mention &#34;Backdrifts,&#34; Where I end and You Begin&#34; and &#34;A Wolf at the Door.&#34;  Wait, did I just list every song on this record?  If not, &#34;I Will.&#34;  LOL.  Geez, I gotta stop writing about this and just listen to it RIGHT NOW.  :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is way easy to use! I love it for anything and everything i esp love the big buttons for easy to see and alot easier to hit the correct button
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I love this book! It's so romantic I wish I could  find some one like John he sounds so wonderful and I love him haha.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so awsome and i love playing it. this is the best app i have ever played well one of the best.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was a great movie.  Even better knowing it was based on a true event.  Acting was excellent and the movie was suspenseful.
B0012GN47C|3.0|I guess is not one of my favorites, maybe it will grow with time after ALL is Santana...... and it happen before I hated Sgt Peppers the first time I heard it, and NOW is my favorite Beatles Album
B005K17RU0|5.0|I tried a few other weather apps but I find myself going to this one all the time. it. i find it accurate
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I enjoyed the wit and humor of this book... I found myself laughing out loud at many points. Oberon the Irish Wolfhound made the book for me... How can you go wrong with a GIANT DOG that wants to be Genghis Khan?
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Gotta love a band that will not sell their music to a commercial brand if they don't like the product and THEN turn around and SUE that company for hiring studio musicians to copy their trademark sound and using it instead. BRAVO BEACH HOUSE!  However, the music they produce is original and very entertaining. Avant-garde? Maybe. A cross between art and pop? Maybe. Worth buying? Definitely. If you want to enter a world of music different from the mundane- Beach House BLOOM, is a must. Just don't ask them if you can use it for your commercial!
B001JNNDAQ|2.0|I find myself flabbergasted that this film won the Academy Award for best picture.  We watched it last night for the first time, and had to force ourselves to finish it.  This film consists of little more than stakeouts, bickering, and eating, and it has so many flaws that it's almost laughable at times.  For example, when Frog One is eating lunch, Hackman is standing on the sidewalk in plain view watching him for the entire lunch, which was very long.  No cop in the world is going to remain that visible unless he wants to be seen.  And let's not forget that the famous chase scene begins when Hackman sees the sniper on the ground--already running away--from the roof; when Hackman runs down four flights of stairs and gets on the street, he's less than 100 yards from the guy.<br /><br />Characters are developed only in the most superficial of ways.  Hackman utters a few racial slurs, so we know he's a racist.  Schieder's character just hangs around with him, but we learn nothing of him as a person.  We know nothing of any of the criminals other than the fact that they're criminals.  And let's not forget that Hackman was taken off special investigations, yet a few minutes later is back on, with no explanation as to why.<br /><br />All in all, there are a few strengths here, but they're not enough to pull this film from the depths of mediocrity.  It was unique for its time, but that doesn't make it a great film, and it certainly doesn't make it a classic.  It's very dated, very slow, and only slightly believable (the scenes in the bar with the black men are actually cringeworthy).
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Very flexable and configurable calculator package for Android devices and includes RPN entry as an option.<br />A must have for students, engineers, people working in physical sciences and mathmatics.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is the best series since &#34;Friends.&#34; Well worth the money to collect this great ensemble of funny actors. Thanks.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I thought this was easy to understand. I just published my first e-book and &#34;Building Your Book for Kindle&#34; helped a lot.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|The game doesn't even let you swing your sword. Bad Bad Baaaaaaadddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I only played once because it sucked. Did I say it was bad. Because I think it is.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I  can't remember where the recommendation for this book came from but it was spot on.  Good story. Good writing. Well paced.  Great suspense. I could not read the book when I was home alone at night.  I've been recommending it to my friends.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I had a dream just last night about Jaws.  He didn't kill me but he was sure scary.  I go surfing about twice every year it's great for the soul but I get freaked out every time not gonna lie
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Movie was definitely for mature audiences only! I can only say that it ended the way it should have. He did the right thing, but I admire the fact he could function under extreme conditions; both personally and professionally. Something to think about the next time you fly.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have read this book 3 times, and I enjoy it more each time.  I recommend this book to every young women that I know.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Only got this because it was at the holiday priced.  The fact of having 13 episodes for over 50 dollars is stupid  I wish that the other season would be between 20-30 dollars each.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I have other cds by Josh Groban and this is very good and easy to listen to. Good for loading to walkman and taking to the beach
B004T32SOK|5.0|Works great and I can access my files on the go.  I have not tried to upload files using this app and dont think I would need to.  No issues so far so I'm very satisfied.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|Good listening, when relaxing.<br />Would recommend to my friends<br />I like this type of music<br />and have purchased like cd's
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I haven't had this App for terribly long but so far it has been able to do everything I've asked of it, mostly basic math and trig.  I am running it on a 10&#34; Android tablet (Xoom) and have not had any problems.  It operates in the portrait mode however and my preference is working in landscape.  I'd like to see that selectable but I would not let that deter you from an otherwise quite capable calculator app.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is a very cute  love story with a strange twist. It was kind of like reading Sleeping With The Enemy meets Ghost.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so good I couldn't put it down. Even my husband was getting up dates as I read.  It would be even better if there was a sequel .
B009A3NGF4|5.0|As good as their previous album is, improvement was no small task.  This album is more consistent.  And I really enjoy the bonus tracks.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Don't believe the propaganda campaign that's been launched against this film by the GOP and the gas and oil industries. Do the research yourself, and make up your own minds.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I like the graphics and the game does provide suspense but actual help with the controls in the Help section would be useful. &quot;Run, collect notes, don't die&quot; (or something close to that) is not very helpful if you aren't instructed HOW to run.  Eventually I got it figured out but it was very frustrating in the beginning.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the best book EVER!!!!!! I literally COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!!! There were so many revelations that i seriously did not see coming! So well written and just amazing. Go read it now! Ms. Hoover definitely has a new fan in this girl!!! *points to self* :-)
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This is a simple box with just what I wanted and need, the three Toy Story movies.  It is an imported Blu-ray but has no problems playing.  This set will be enjoyed for many years to come.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|I like this adapter but it's a bit tricky getting it into my stereo system. It's the only one that i have seen that does the job and it does work great!
B001NN4162|5.0|This particular one is from a different region but plays with no problems.  I bought it before the US blu-ray release.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Those that are considering watching this show well this season is a must see since it can hook a non fan like myself into a fan in just one episode
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|First off-the subject is sex and it is fairly graphic. But I found my mind moving beyond the subject of &#34;sex&#34; and onto the need for intimacy.  Helen Hunt and William H. Macy are beyond brilliant. I laughed and cried and fell in love with all of the characters!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I gave it three because it managed to get one knife sharpened another just dulled more ( both knives had same grind and angle) like the rod but it doesn't work that great either. Don't buy this unless you're puttin it in a BOB or SHTF bag
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel, as always, was amazing!  But it was a tough story to watch. I gave it 3 stars. But it def not something I would recommend-except to an addict!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Entertaining enough. Simple language. Easy read. Not a literary masterpiece. Did not live up to all the hype in my opinion.....
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a great update of two of the most intresting detectives to ever come along.  The twists and surprises of the plot keeps you guessing as you try to solve the mysteries along with Sherlock and Dr. W.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Not as intuitive as I hoped but has lots of good information.  The accuracy is good and the graphics are good
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel carries this movie for sure. Without him, I cannot see it working.<br /><br />As far as keeping me interested, this movie falls way short.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars for the acting of Denzel and John Goodman.<br /><br />Overall I feel let down by this movie. I wasted my time watching it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Play it all the time I find it relaxing and play it often to rlieve stress great pass time relaxer
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wow!  Great ending to this book! Man I just couldn't put it down!Nicholas sparks never disappoints.  I love the way he goes so in depth with his characters.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|When I saw this in theatre, I felt like it would be one of my all-time favorite movies.  I rarely watch movies more than once, but I can watch this over and over.  I swear the ending is different than the cinema version, though, and this version has a little less punch.  Rooney Mara is so freaking good in this role, it is just killer.  Her facial expressions are amazing.  Have not watched any other features, so cannot comment on that.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|Very interesting and informative. I have found a lot of info explaining pain which gave me understanding of my condition.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is a great collection, if you love Columbo, this is definitely for you , the video quality is awesome , the only bad thing I have experienced is sometimes the DVD will freeze and you will have to restart it from all over again , I am hoping that's my DVD player and not the actual DVDs ( it only happened to me twice thus far )<br />It's worth the money, mine was on sale for 69.99$ one weekend, and if you open an amazon credit card, you get 30$ off so I ended up paying 39.99 $ . Honestly I was going to pay the original price of 129$ if it wasn't on sale.<br />Columbo was before my time, my mom loved watching him, so now I know why she did :-) get it & you will have a nice collection of 8 DVDs total , each DVD has 3 or 4 sometimes 5 DVDs inside, and each DVD will have two or three episodes .
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|GREAT MOVIE PERFECT VIEEWING ONLY WISH PRIME MEMBERSHIP WOULD ALLOW ME YO WATCH OUT OF THE COUNTRY! CANT UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN ORDER AND WATCH PAID MOVIES,  BUT FREE PRIME MEMBER MOVIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorite pastimes is comparing film to the source book. So, when OPB aired the BBC series starting Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, I had to read the book. To make a long story short, Miss Austen acreated characters that have stood the test of time. They have depth, virtues and faults. The twists and turns in the plot add interest to draw out her sketches of human behavior and paint glimpses life that would otherwise be lost. Eliza Bennet is an independent and intelligent main character who proves adaptable, sensible and very adequately romantic.
B000002OAZ|4.0|This is a good blues album, but it aint the hard driving blues, south Chicago cant sit down stuff. since getting this album I triped across a very special set of albums: BB King with Bobby Blue Bland.<br />The best single blues vocal in my opinion is Howling Wolf doing Smokestack Lightning. then comes about 5 Otis Redding numbers. BUT I totally forgot about Bobby Bland. He is as raw as Howlin Wolf. He only had one Big Hit, Turn On Your Love Light. But this joint effort with BB King (two separate albums actually) is over the top, with lots of live performance jive, and with BB King playing almost like a good rythm section, Bobby screams and snorts in his unique feral style. gotta love it. In comparison I rate the London Wolf at best 3.5 stars, and Bobby & BB Together for the First Time, and Together Again as solid five star, unforgettable blues.
B009X01C64|5.0|Fits my Fire HD great, good protection for it, feels very solid.  Love my Fire HD and this cover. Highly reccomend
B009C7JS14|4.0|I have used this app many times since getting it and it gives me a clear picture of what to expect for the day and future forecast which helps to prepare for wardrobe and packing for trips.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Normally this is not my kind of movie, however, I really liked Pitch Perfect. Some of the lines in this movie are absolutely laugh out of the chair hilarious.  Rebel Wilson had me laughing from the beginning of the movie straight through.  They should have turned up the volume a bit so you could easily hear Hana Mae Lee's lines which were equally hilarious.  The mixture of some really good acapella, better acting than I expected in this type of movie (Skylar Astin, Britney Snow, and Rebel Wilson, to a lesser degree Anna Kendrick), the satirical qualities of the depictions, and the humor made this a movie I'd watch again just for a replay of the lines.  I would recommend this for at least a 1 x view.  My actual rating 3++ to 4
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Great follow up to his previous album which was popular.  I like the music and gets better the more I listen to the CD.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I didn't think that Matt Damon could be easily replaced in the Bourne saga, however, Jeremy Renner was much better than billed.  His character was believable.  He pulled off the martial art scenes and conveyed the anxiousness, that would have naturally been present, as one would imagine it would actually be.  I thought Rachel Weisz complimented Renner wonderfully even though her portrayal of Dr. Marta nearly overshadowed Jeremy because she played the part so well.  I thought the movied equalled the others in the Bourne saga.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action/adventure movies.
B0014LX420|3.0|Good selection of songs, i like the rhythm and the beat.  2 CD's gives great value for the money spent.
B00BHMF578|1.0|Basically, the real life story is an incredible story that was crammed into a movie setting by a very poor actor and director.  The movie's billing would suggest that the scenes are very intense, keep you on the edge of your seat, and that Affleck's performance would be over the top for the role like, for example, Heath Ledger's &#34;Joker&#34; in Batman or Charlton Heston in &#34;Ben Hurr&#34;.  This movie does nothing, in my estimation, to suggest Ben Affleck will ever be more than a pathetic actor with a pretty face. The scenes are rushed, barely believable, and, with the exception of a couple of scenes (short enough to nearly be considered cameos)  by Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and very limited scenes by the lesser known actors making up the group of hostages, this movie could just as easily been performed by a B movie cast with a similar or better outcome.  The money spent for production is barely visible but enough so that it would not be considered a pure B movie.  Academy award worthy?  You have to be kidding me.  I would not recommend this to anyone except to the extent it could be used as an example of how bad a movie can be and still get an academy award.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Interesting gameplay, strategy, cute graphics, entertaining quests, surprising interactions AND Pirates! What more could one ask from a game? Yes, you might have to buy diamonds to speed the action along, but I loved the Playmobil characters so much I didn't want to miss a moment with them!
B00AESN8XY|2.0|I found that this game had accidentally been removed from my device, I reinstalled it, only to find that all, ALL of my purchases were gone, I checked again only to no avail, I refuse to buy and play through to unlock the types AGAIN. Other than this issue it is a wonderful game, just be wary.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|No TV show is perfect, but it's been a while since I was anxious to get home from work and watch more of one.  Downton Abbey is usually quite well scripted, with interesting character relationships and focusing on a period in history that is quite unlike any other.  Some things are a little forced, and while there are character arcs, it's sometimes hard to tell if they are naturally occurring or the writer just really wants them to be different.  Worth watching for the Anna/Bates relationship development all by itself, most of the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very well set up for the learning of what it takes to own and take care of a horse. Fun game I just wish it was easier to get coins and gems.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Gan we get to the action, please? Oh, wait there is a ten second fight, now more character introduction and exposition.... At least the fight at the end was cool.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|This entire album is brilliant.  Emeli Sande is a talented artist and I cannot wait to hear more from her in the future.  I just saw her live and she's just as amazing.  Get this album, you won't regret it!
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|This is from the new school of thought that says, 'why cant parents/adults enjoy this also?'. It was well written, tells an interesting (all be it simple) story and was a joy to watch with the kids.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really fun game!!!! Eats up lots of time!!!! Fun story line!!! Fun to play if your bored or have nothing to do!!! Great app and even better its free!!!<br /> /
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's really creepy but addicting and fun.... but I keep fa amount through holes I the map it sucks cuz I had like 6 or 7 hours each time
B00BHMF578|4.0|Definitely an academy nominee.  Just the right amount of poetic license with the facts.<br />But probably should not have edged out lincoln for best picture.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this app! I find it to be very challenging and I do win sometimes! The polyp ads are kind of annoying, but I won't let that stop me from playing.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|All of the actors are exceptional.  Not a bad one in the bunch.  Good story lines.  Fast paced enough so you don't get bored with the story.  I have watched only season one and the first episode of season two, which was my least favorite due to the ghost girl being the main storyline throughout.  I'm not into ghost stores.  I hope the remaining episodes will be as good as the first season.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downtown abbey is completely addicting. You have been warned. You will get lost in the time period and the drama of the Grantham Family and their staff. The cinematography is breathtaking.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|The show continues to surprise.The acting is great.I look at everyone in the show wondering if they are one of the cult.  I'm glad that it's been renewed.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I love all the songs on this cd and I received it in perfect condition. Nice to have for any collection
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Very good service and a good fun game to play  Wish for more games like this one.  Thank you kindly goodbye
B006HL9G10|5.0|easy to use,  pleasant sounds. i like the different types of tones.  the extra features are also very nice. works well on my kindle fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best I always wanted it on kindle and now it is it still gets update but not. the same as pc
B001GUXJQA|3.0|The Black Ice is the seventh Bosch book I've read. I started with some of the later publications. I am now in the process of reading the entire series in order from the beginning. Black Ice started out well but seemed to drag during the middle at a deadly dull pace. There was way too much narration to keep one interested, almost like the author was trying to stretch the word count out. I was close to giving up but glad that I didn't. The last 30 percent of the book was worth the wait. I also noted some grammatical errors and even \\"person\\" errors throughout. I was surprised because Connelly is noted for almost perfect copy and content editing. Overall, I rate the book a 3 1/2 on a 5 scale.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read, the only bad thing about the books was that they had to end. I would recommend these books strongly to anyone who wants a good thriller of a story.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As I had read different biographies, when Steve Jobs died and this one came out. I think it was after his dead, I bought it. I like better the Allan Deutschmann one, but this one goes till 2011, so gives a good review of the last years.<br /><br />The point is the last years have been so exciting, with the ipad appearance, that the book does not have time to tell us the incredible boom we are watching with tablets.<br /><br />The present has to be written by us, his inheritance.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I read the many positive reviews and some of the negative ones and I have to agree with the negative reviews. This game is very pointless. Unlike other negative reviews, I actually like the control system. Most games like this have static controls to manipulate movement and view, but this one seems to register correctly everywhere I touched making it kind of cool.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the game itself really sucks. I played \\"road\\" or whatever and basically you just walk down the road and get some notes. Every once in a while you see the \\"slender man\\" appear in the woods and if you approach him you die. Other than picking up notes from trees and crap you don't really do anything else. The sound is very repetitive and somewhat reminiscent of the sound you hear in a Friday the 13th kind of horror movie when the killer is about to strike...only it's far less ominous and just loops over and over and over again. After 5 minutes I had to turn the volume off because of how annoying it was.<br /><br />So, maybe I don't get it...I never heard of \\"Slender Man\\" before and there seems to be some lore around him...but the game itself is incredibly and horribly boring with no story line that I can see, no action, no activity, and nothing at all scary. With the hundred+ reviews talking about how incredibly fun and scary it is, I was expecting more...much more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent game for horse lovers good graphics suitable for all ages my six year old niece loves it as does my twenty six year old sister
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|When I was a kid reading comics with my fellow pre-teens, we fantasized about our favorite superheroes being made into live-action movies. It finally happened.<br /><br />My own personal copy of Marvel's The Avengers is one (of many) proofs that there IS a God.<br /><br />And He answers prayers.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Awesome series. Great story line. Keeps the view wanting more episode to episode. Working on season 4 now and cannot stop watching.
B005FDXT32|5.0|I don't have that many movies in my movie collection, but I just HAD to have this one in there. It's a freakin' CLASSIC. 'nuff said.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Good story, and when it uses over-the-top technology, etc., it does so with a wink at the audience. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the story moves along well.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Somewhat disturbing revelations of treatment of children in church-run orphanages.  Story ended well though. Interesting reading in comparison to some books I have read lately.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Sometimes movies that combine superheroes don't work, but this one does. And the storyline works too. Good for people who have followed these individual superheroes, and even if you haven't.
B00B1MHA18|4.0|Dear Ben Harper, this is a good album. But it could have been a GREAT album if you could be a little less careless with your bad habits. Charlie Musselwhite- Don't change a thing!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A friend gave me this book.  I started to read it but after turning 50 Shads of Red I put it down.  I told her it was too sexually grapfic for me.  She told me a little bit about Christian's story though and talked me into trying to read again.  As I started to realize he did have a story I got interested- he is a very compelling character.  Anastasia however comes off as a very intelligent but immature young woman (she's only 20).  I would love to see this book written without hundreds of &#34;Holy Cows and Holy Crap's&#34;.  Very juvenile. She is very confused for most of this book but seems to find her direction right at the end.
B003PWPGT0|4.0|As a life long Heartbreakers fan, I give this album high praise. It passes that test of being new and familiar.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|O.k., I read the first book and got really interested seeing where the story would go.  Christian's character grows when he finds he has to make adjustment to have what he really wants-Anastasia.  Anastasia however remains intelligent but immature (no more &#34;Holy Craps&#34;-puleeze) Is she an adult or not? Does she want him and all that goes with him or not?  Cant seems to make up her mind and sends lots of mixed signals to poor Christian who is trying to let go of his old life to please her.  Am hooked now and wiill read the third book to see how the story ends.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This was an &#34;okay&#34;read. Not sure I would recommend this book. Left me not knowing whether I like or dislike this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|O.K., Christian has totally become  my hero.  He has used loving Anastasia as a way to bring him out of the darkness of his childhood and toward leading a more normal life.  Hooray, he deserves it.  This book in the trilogy has better writing (except for the continued mixed signals from Anastasia and more &#34;Holy Craps&#34;.  Her character did not seem to grow at all, she just demanded what she thinks she wanted and then accepted Christian even though she keeps delving and changing him.  Christian evolved but she did not.  Even after all the kinky stuff she did with Christian she would lot let him go into the bathroom with her when she had to pee?  Come on, normal couples do that even those who have not engaged in the acts, using the special devices, Christian introdduced her to.  Makes no sense.  But then she is still sending mixed signals to Christian even while he is trying so hard to get better and be what she &#34;says&#34; she wants right to the end.<br />Glad I read the series and looking back I see I rated the first book 3 stars, the second 4 stars and the third 5 stars so I guess I felt they improved each time.  Interesting sidelines with her boss, both their families, and her friends.
B002QEXN8E|5.0|If you're a Mano Chao fan, and i don't get it if you're not, this is just  terrific Mano Chao.
B00785P2QC|5.0|BEST GAME EVER TOTALY WORTH 5 STARS......GET THE GAME get it get it get it get it get it get it get it
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|my only complaint is that you should add the ability to, every 10 levels, be able to buyvanother breeding cave. great game otherwise!
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift for his setup in the car. He uses it on long trips and says it works perfectly. Prompt delivery.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Heartwarming, humerous, and delightful.  &#34;Intouchables&#34; gets FIVE STARS WAY UP!  One suggestion - sometimes subtitles can be hard to read.  Subtitles should always be displayed in black print so that they clearly show up on the screen.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was an entertaining read about two lovers with issues. Who can't relate with that? Only 3 stars because I don't want to relate.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl's mother was a free spirited woman who never held back her love. She provided the foundation for Cheryl's world. That world seems to crumble around Cheryl  when her mother passes away from cancer. Her family drifts apart and her own reckless behavior leads to divorce from her husband Paul.<br />Cheryl decides to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in an effort to overcome her grief and find a direction for her life.<br />Her boots are too small and her pack, &#34;the Monster&#34; is too large. She relies on a trail guide, hikers, other good souls she encounters along the trail, and her friend, Lisa, who sends the resupply packages that Cheryl left with her before her journey began. She tells her life-changing story with honesty and humor.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|We recently purchased a new HP printer. This app is available to install on the Kindle Fire to enable wireless printing. It was easy to download onto the Kindle. I had it working in a short time following the instructions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I avoided Downton Abbey for a long time. I was not an Upstairs; Downstairs fan, and I thought this was more of the same. I was wrong!  I care about the characters - we human beings, whether rich or poor, share a commonality when it comes to flaws of character, and also when it comes to finding redemption. The acting is terrific. Maggie Smith's expressions and timing set the standard for the rest of the cast. Cinamatically, the sets and costumes are outstanding, the show is a visual treat. I found myself drawn into the storyline and I was always sad when the episode came to an end. Give this series a chance. You will learn what good story-telling is when you became part of the Downton family..
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is not that cool! Pc edition is better because<br />you can get a skin easily and the controls are easier  to use and there are mods and it rules!!! Period!
B007FSF1FE|4.0|A gritty, greasy, soulful recording. Dan Auerbach takes Dr John back to his roots, and it's fantastic. Could have been recorded in the 70's (and I mean that in a good way!)
B0063IH60K|5.0|very colorful and fun, much better that playing it on a Kindle in black and white!fun fun fjun fun fun
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I'm not certain why some said you had to read the book to appreciate the movie. No doubt reading the book would have given more insight to the main character, but as someone who never read it, I was still able to follow the storyline and found the movie worthwhile.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|didn't care for this very much, but you really need to shorten the &#34;words&#34; for these reviews, too much too
0765334798|4.0|It took about 50 pages to get into this novel, and I wasn't really impressed with the writing - it seems (and rightly so) a veiled ghost of Galaxy Quest. That being said, the final 50 pages brought the rest of the novel into focus. The entire concept is ultimately, one big con. I may have read too much into this, but the change in writing style is jarring near the end, leading me to believe that - like films like Total Recall - what you see is not at all what is actually happening. I realized the poor writing is more calculated than we might have been led to believe.<br /><br />If you think I'm being vague, well, I am. This isn't the most original work out there, but once I got what the author was trying to do, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and saw it through to the end. The final chapter is great, and leaves you scratching your head.<br /><br />This is more than a satire of Star Trek, so give it a shot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has been a while since I have gotten this app and finally I am writing a review. You want to know why it has been so long? I was just too busy actually playing the game!!!!!!! You don't even have to think about it....JUST GET THE APP!!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|So that's something of a bold statement to make in the title, but &#34;Skyfall&#34; truly looks and &#34;feels&#34; very different from the previous two films. It's a great movie, no question there, and I have watched it three times since it arrived and maybe by the fact that it does seem so different is what keeps bringing me back to watch it. I love &#34;Casino Royale&#34; as well as &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; and am solid in my opinion that Daniel Craig has created the single best version of James Bond in the entire Bond world, and that consistency continues in &#34;Skyfall&#34;, even with the the movie having such a different look and feel.<br /><br />I can, and do, recommend &#34;Skyfall&#34; and it's a movie I have to watch again multiple times in part because, in my mind, it really does stand apart from every other Bond film made.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Never thought I'd have the opportunity to have this type of calculator on my phone. It's great in the event that I forget my regular calc.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|One word that comes to mind about this one is \\"confusing\\". There was a lot going on in this movie, and maybe I should have watched the first two again before seeing this installment but in general, the storyline seemed thin and barely able to hold itself, much less the overall movie, together. It's another movie that left me feeling generally underwhelmed, partly due to not quite understanding what was directing the characters; as if there was another movie that built up to this one and that movie was never seen by anyone. It just seemed like there was a lot of back-story that just wasn't expressed or developed enough to enable me to \\"get behind\\" the characters and believe in them.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is one of my favorite movies, \\"The Dark Knight\\" was great but, in my opinion, it was such a fast paced \\"in-your-face\\" kind of experience, (particularly in the theater), that it was hard to follow specific things and/or actions at times. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" just felt like a slower-paced, hodgepodge of elements that just weren't knitted together quite right, the results of which made for something of an underwhelming finale to the series.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|Love this show! First time i ordered it though, the package was broken. I opened it and plastic pieces fell out, so i shipped it back to Amazon, requested a replacement and i got one without no hassle and no fees..so that's why the 4 stars. I'm rating the ordering experience. I give the show 10 stars! :D
B005LAIHQS|3.0|I don't know if it was my mood the night I watched this or if it really is just a so-so movie. Maybe another viewing will inspire a better review, maybe not. I think this was better than MIB 2, but not by much. The novelty of &#34;Men in Black&#34; was refreshing, entertaining, and fun. That aside, both sequels just haven't had the magic of the first movie. Almost as though the folks involved are just trying entirely too hard to top the first movie and just somehow missed the magic. I don't know, I'm not in the movie business so I don't know what goes on or how things are done. What I do know is that the word &#34;lackluster&#34; came to mind as the ending credits began to roll.<br /><br />Admittedly I bought MIB3 just to see it and partially because the reviews I read online lead me to believe it was better than the second installment, but in general I was underwhelmed. I'm going to watch it again at some point and will update this review if there's a change in opinion.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This Disc was worth the price. Which was very fair. We have watched it several times. Makes a great gift for the classic rock fans.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Keeps  my grandson busy and is habit forming.  He would play it all day if I let him do so.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|Ben did a great job with this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was great to see a movie be so thrilling without major explosions or massive gun fights.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Although the story line may seem a bit far fetched, the book is easy to read. Full of both humor and heartbreak. And a couple of surprise twists. Well worth the read.
B005COO1X6|1.0|thank God it was a short story... After ready 11/22/63 which I consider to be his best book ever, this was crazy.

0307719774|5.0|My best friend and I talk about everything!!! While looking for another journal I came across this one and told her about it.  We decided that if one of us got one they other had to have it as well.  I got us both one for yule and we started them as of January 1st this year (2013.)  We answer them every day and talk to each other about what we wrote.  It is a great way for us to laugh at how different but the same we are!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I ENJOY playing this game, it goes fast, is easy to play.  Simple, good to pass the time so. Fun
1401223176|4.0|Jeph Loeb is worshiped by some, and &#34;meh&#34;d by others. well, if you need a reason not to &#34;meh&#34; Jeph Loeb. read Batman: HUSH.<br /><br />The plot is great, story is great, the characters are great, and the artwork....JIM LEE IS GOD!!!!<br /><br />er....ahem...<br /><br />Jim Lee is an exquisite penciler,  putting forth effort, honest to goodness effort, to make this book look amazing.<br /><br />do not pass this up. It is a must own for any fan of the comics medium, or just a fan of great stories.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I price insurance products that are complicated and have to be accurate. This book hit home.  We were doing things using our gut or our brain and missing the 'stupid things'. We also had a Master Builder approach that relied to much on expertise.<br /><br />We are now using the checklist approach throughout our process. I have bought this book for several team members and spreading the religion. We are even planning a visit to a construction site to see checklists in action.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with a complicated process and who has been wondering why there have been mistakes made along the way.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Very cool version of Angry Birds. Love the weapons, sound effects and cast of Star Wars birds in their costumes.

B006CBSE86|3.0|seems like once tarja did her own thing that maybe she has become more mellow. there are some good songs on this but not nearly as likable as any of there others
0399245030|5.0|We watched the award-winning short film based on this book; loved it so much we had to purchase the book. Oliver Jeffers is now one of our family's favorite authors. We regularly read this book at bedtime. It is such a sweet story that we don't mind reading it over and over again. I cannot recommend it enough! You won't be sorry.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Always enjoy a game of solitaire. I play it sometimes when I have a busy day as a way to de-stress
B0002EXH5E|1.0|Look - There is no Reason to say anything about this CD - It sucks really bad<br />Biggest sellout in a real bad way in the history of Metal<br /><br />I personally don't think naming the album \\"Risk\\" excuses anything. I mean, it's a bad album. Personally, I can't stand Risk, and even if the title explains it's a \\"Risk\\", so is every single musical album ever made, this one failed, but I'm supposed to be OK with that because they thought it might?<br />If St. Anger was called \\"It Might Suck\\" would that﻿ be better? Or new Morbid Angel was called \\"Not Our Usual\\" would it excuse the complete lack of good music?<br /><br />By the way - this is not a one off bad album for Megastink - 80 Percent of their albums suck - I know Dave is not trying to be a Vocalist - But there are good Non-singers: Lemmy, Geddy Lee, Cronos, Udo and than there are people who spent an entire career actually making money with the most abominable vocals ever laid down. If Dave Mustaine went to a karaoke night and got up to sing - yeah, we would all laugh at how terrible his voKills are, but that is the fun of karaoke - but this guy made an entire career on abominable Vokills and the fans still bought it not realizing it was only the riffs that make Megedeth Good - But Dave gave up the Riffs to try and be a Singer Songwriter when he has no talent at this.<br /><br />On this CD - Its not just the voKills which suck - everything on this piece of crap sucks - its to be laughed at and mocked<br /><br />Other Megedeth albums that suck: - Well, Pretty Much everything starting with Youthanasia - this is when Dave<br />Thought he could be a \\"Non Great Riffs\\" Band and started to try and make more commercial sounding albums - if he wanted to do that he should of brought in a real singer, or at least a good non-singer. He still might have failed as he has little talent other than being a great guitarist and coming up with good riffs<br /><br />Stick to Rust in Peace - Risk is the Bottom of a career of reallybad albums<br /><br />Id give this a Zero but they don't offer that option
B005IDXIL2|3.0|It's okay---not much of a challenge but I wasn't looking for that, it is a nice relaxing game---it only gives a couple of options to change things up, would like a few more.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Good clean fun movie, you can enjoy with the whole family or an evening alone.  I wish I would have watched it before the Avengers
B0063GORYU|4.0|spider solitaire can be a small challenge some times but fun. It is a great way to pass the time if  you are at an appointment or can't sleep at night.
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Excellent writing and kept me engrossed waiting for the next shoe to fall.... Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys irony
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like it because it has a lot of meanings to a lot of words so I like it ok
B008133MDK|4.0|I truly enjoyed the writing of the show and the acting. The only issue I have is that there are not enough episodes!
B009E3EY38|5.0|This set was way more than I could have hoped for. To see them and to hear the same sounds was truly awesome.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a fast read but like all Sparks books, it was pretty predictable.  It really reminded me of the movie &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;
B007K8ILTW|3.0|I honestly didn't know anything about the story of Kubrciks first film.  I never expect a fiction world surrounded by war.  I guess this 1953 reflects the concerns of a young American about war.  Madness, murders, meaningful life etc...  It is not really a good film, but help us to show young Kubrick´s concerns, for example in Paths of Glory...
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is just what it says; an easy to use white noise generator for relaxation. It opens quickly and doesn't try to sell me other things. I like it.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Loved going back to the 50's and 60's of my youth. That day is burned into my memory and the possibility of a different outcome was very interesting.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|The app installed easily on my phone and works well. I can select multiple items for upload and download, and the thumbnail viewer is fast. It also allows me to open the photos with other applications for editing, or upload to Facebook and Flickr.
0452295548|5.0|As a scientist who has had some &#34;brain work&#34; performed on me, I found this step-by-step explanation of Dr. Taylor's very personal &#34;what's and why's&#34; of her personal journey from near-total-failure to recovery to be a magnificent presentation. It should be required reading for all members of all families (that's a lot of people!) who have had any sort of brain-function upset. Dr.Taylor leaves no stone unturned.<br /><br />It's too much to hope that the general population would care to dip into this wonderful personal story, but there is so much to be learned and understood about this incredibly complex mechanism residing within our skulls that makes us who we are.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor's students are fortunate to be associated with such a gifted communicator. And we are fortunate that she has addressed us with her book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|watched the first 2 DVD's, the third season DVD is just as great, can not wait for the next one!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got frustrated many times with streaming . At times it would freeze but undid find during off hours it worked better but it shouldn't be that way. Many times I debated just buying it on iTunes and watching it on Apple TV
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Faster delivery and I just plain old like his music.  Keeps me centered and helps at home and on the go in traffic.
B009UWYFFK|4.0|We finally had a chance to watch this movie, which the boys had been talking about since seeing the adverts back at Halloween. Short version is that it's great fun.<br /><br />The story is pretty simplistic. You have an over-protective father (who just happens to be Dracula) and a human who wanders into a hotel for monsters (all of whom are more scared of him than he is of them). Don't expect too much in the way of Pixar sophistication or pathos either. This is more about fart jokes.<br /><br />And you know what, that's fine. Because this is aimed unashamedly at kids. And it gives them things to laugh at.  Adam Sandler and his usual band of cohorts provide solid vocal work throughout but the star of the show is the animation.<br /><br />The movie was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky who is probably best known for his traditional hand drawn 2D animation for the likes of Dexter's Laborator or Samurai Jack. Here he fully embraces what 3D computer animation can offer, without feeling obliged to mimic real life.<br /><br />That's what gives this film energy and propels to above average status in my mind.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|You buy one of these calc programs and across the to, on your yor home page it says &#34;best app&#34;. I returned the kindle and do not like the limited apps available

B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Falling Skies is a great and unexpected TV series. I'm glad it's here for Amazon Prime users. Great actors and story. I care about the characters and what happens to them. Hope the series continues.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For 3 seasons I listened to everyone rave about this show ... finally I decided to give it a try through Netflix .. after a few episodes of season 1 I was hooked. It is not about the Zombies, it is about the directing, and production and acting that goes into this show. Not to mention the amazing special effects and make up.  A show worth your time!
B008Y73940|4.0|My boyfriend and I enjoyed this movie. Sometimes its difficult to find something we both enjoy watching, so that was a big plus for me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle is a true American hero! This book chronicles his selfless dedication to his country and to his brothers in arms. Its an easy read with a great story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! Fun and educational. Perfect for those who want a horse but don't have a place for one! A1!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A lttle different than solitaire. Again, you use the battery faster but I enjoy the game. It's a good pasttime.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I would give this 5 stars if it would allow me to link to Facebook like it is on my phone
1572814349|5.0|I love the pictures, I bought it as a gift, the recipient loved it. The interpretations are similar to standard Waite Rider/ Pamela Coleman sorts of language, but with a twist. The Illustrations are adaptations of Renaissance paintings.
1401234550|5.0|great artwork and a good start in a story that will captivate for a long time with many more issues
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful! I know exactly how much battery life I have.I would definitely suggest someone to download it. It's free Abe very useful. At first I didn't know what it was and thought it was just a cool gadget my daughter had downloaded. However, when I used it it proved itself very handy.
0316212377|3.0|I've been reading Banks since the late 90's and this is one of the best Iain M Banks stories I've read since Excession, my favorite IAB book. It's true space opera with intrigue, interesting alien cultures, manipulation, conspiracy and space battles. Unfortunately, the action in this book is really lacking. It's simply not compelling at all. It doesn't grip you and seems flat. At moments, it's even difficult to follow. By the end of the book I found I skimmed the last &#34;big&#34; battle just to get to the conclusion. When I put the book down, unlike Excession, I knew I would never read it again because the action just wasn't there...what's space opera without cool space battles?! It's a decent read, but I would recommend a library read versus a purchase.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A fun soap opera set in the early 1900's. Fun, fun, fun. Can't wait to watch season 3 and season 4.
0984380213|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best, applicable sales books I have read and I've read many.  While it focuses on Saas products given Aaron's background at Salesforce, we've found it to be an excellent &#34;blueprint&#34; for building the sales process in our consulting firm as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an entertaining because you get to maintain your own horse it is very extremely fun to help your horse
B00ALQSY2Y|5.0|The depictions of the dinosaurs were amazing - color and texture, you would swear you were looking at a real animal. Very nicely done, so much so I am really glad we were not on the planet when this big fellow was.
B0081336FO|5.0|I can't wait til season 3 - Really enjoy the way this show is filmed and the friendship between Sherlock & Watson is portrait with great care.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been on Facebook for about 5 years now and it has had me hooked the entire time.  A great way to keep up with old friends and make new friends.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Again only took a day to watch and left me wanting for more. I can't wait until Season 3 & 4 are on Amazon Prime.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is easily the prettiest game I've ever played and maybe one of the most fun! If you liked Empress of the Deep 1 & 2,  or Ravenhearst you'll love this. The story is great, too, but as gorgeous as this game is, it's just a super bonus.<br /><br />The ho scenes are chocked full of topical objects fully visible and none below the inventory bar. The zoom feature works great without loss of resolution. Hints work great, too. Puzzles are good but do have a skip option. Really runs perfectly and smoothly.<br /><br />I really, really wish the whiners who don't want to pay for his game would just shut up, already! It's pretty good bet that if a game tells you it is set up to take cash that you will have to pay for something!!!! No one is holding a gun to your head to make you buy it. This game gives you more than plenty of time to decide whether or not you want to buy more! In this instance I paid 4.99$ to upgrade from within the game and I would gladly have paid MORE!!!!<br /><br />This game has it all...it's visually stunning, has a great story, no glitches whatsoever, hours of play and replay AND is a superb value! I loved the fact that you CAN'T get stuck or too confused because the game tells you when you have completed a scene. This is a GREAT GAME, certainly one of the very best out there and would be fun to play with kids or grandkids, too! Can't say enough about it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a great little app to kill time with. The kids like trying to unlock the different games within the app. Some are more challenging then others.
B007N31XNA|5.0|Omg the digital copy was still good , that's why am so happy . I have seen this movie so many times .
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|To enjoy a horror movie, one has to suspend their disbelief. I get that. I'm a huge fan of the genre and am used to acknowledging that the characters are going to be put into dire situations and behave in unrealistic ways. I do enjoy movies, such as Cabin in the Woods, that poke fun at that aspect of the genre, but I usually have no problem going along for the ride.<br /><br />This movie really stretches what I am willing to accept, though. The  movie lost its ability to scare me because Ethan Hawke's character behaves so outlandishly. His character is a once-celebrated author whose last few real life crime stories did not sell well. He is so obsessed with once again becoming famous that he moves his family into the house where a family was murdered so he can investigate the crime.<br /><br />This may be a spoiler, but, as it occurs fifteen minutes into the film, it's not much of one. Hawke's character finds a box in the attic that contains home Super 8s of a series of grisly murders. By comparing some photographs, he realizes that the box was left by someone after the police had cleaned the house. He does what any intelligent person would do. He calls the freaking cops.<br /><br />But--this is a man who is desperate to regain his fame, so he hangs up the phone and decides to play Inspector Gadget himself. This is where I lost interest and all sympathy for our hero. Under the best case scenario, a brutal serial killer left a box of movies for you to find in your attic. At worst, something supernatural is afoot. Either way, do you stick around?<br /><br />I also found this movie predictable. You can easily figure out \\"whodunnit,\\" so the big \\"surprise\\" ending wasn't much of one. I only kept watching to see if his wife would wise up and leave him. *Spoiler alert* She does not.<br /><br />I guess the movie was creepy in spots, but it loses its tension early (and not just because Hawke's character is an a-hole). The scariest jump out of your seat moment happens about thirty minutes in. After that, we just see a drunk Hawke do a really pathetic job of investigating some murders with the help of a dingbat deputy and a professor played by Vincent D'Onofrio (who was the high point of the film).<br /><br />I gave this movie two stars instead of one because I think Ethan Hawke, even in this dog, is an excellent actor. Other than his performance, seeing Fred Thompson as an a-hole sheriff (if only he had stayed on Law & Order and aborted the presidential run!!!), and a few cheap scares, this movie has little to offer.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|not very good. barely gives u any time do do any thing. and takes like 6 min to load on my kindle. I hate it. I wouldn't get it. only reason I got is cause I only have 60 cents on my card, but this tame sux.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I am a big fan of this show and this season did not disappoint. I would highly recommend to any Castle fan.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love Castle  Like the chemistry between Castle and Beckett  Always interesting story.  Support cast is great  Looking forward to rest of season
1449410243|5.0|It had all of the greatness of The Oatmeal in one conveniently portable book. My husband loved it. Has new comics as well as the beloved classics.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|the pc version is a lot scarier/better, i almost beat this my first try, i walked around for 15 minutes looking for the last page on the farm, I gave up. to anyone who doesn't understand how this is scary play the real game in a dark room alone
1616550414|5.0|I pre-ordered this book almost a year ago - it arrived on Feb 13th of this year, just in time for Valentine's Day. My husband screeched like a parrot when he opened the box. I'd say it was a success. It's filled with great concept art, all of the games, a letter from the creator, and a really awesome manga comic in the back. Overall, extremely pleased.
B008220AVW|5.0|I loved it so much that I watched it 2 times in a row!! I didn't get the 3-d movie but it was still good!!
B000001ES9|5.0|So glad to see them finally make it to the Rock and roll Hall of fame,and this is where it all started! Thank you Donna Halper for pushing this band sooo hard in Cleveland,and getting the ball rolling,so this band would be heard all around the US!!! Highly recommended!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|this app is fun but you could add some colour to it, lime sepia, to make it haunted and spooky. or you could make the red parts stand out and everything else sepia Kt black and white.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|If you're afraid to fly you may not want to watch this movie but otherwise it was really good.  I do wish amazon could bump its HD quality up a bit and start offering movie streams in 3d.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is soo addicting. Hard to put it down because I keep thinking, &quot;just one more time,  I can do better&quot;. Grandkids got me started playing.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for one of my granddaughters (age 6) for Christmas.  She loved it.  I like to get the kids more &#34;traditional&#34; toys as opposed to the electronic ones they have.  The Friends Lego sets provide hours of educational and make believe play.  It's great to see Legos marketed for girls too.  I would definitely recommend this set.
B008220C38|5.0|This movie has produced a strong divide among viewers--it seems either people love it or they hate it. I, for one, loved it! The cinematography was artfully done, the costumes were beautiful, and the music was unique.<br /><br />In film adaptations of such a long book, things will inevitably be left out. The director's choices were bold, but I thought they made for a captivating and thoroughly enjoyable movie-going experience!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is amazing.. there is no words good enough to explain this masterpiece.. It chokes me up. Just WOW
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It was an interesting read on the life of a SEAL in Iraq. Some of the stories were fragmented, not quite as polished as Lone Survivor.
030758836X|1.0|Anything interesting or clever in this is completely undone by the ending.  It's so bad it rendered the rest of the book a complete waste of time.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so scary only in needs better contorls to run AWSOME GAME GET IT WHILE ITS FREE !!
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I gave &#34;Everville&#34; two chances before setting it to the side unable to read on. The writing, while not horrible, probably appeals to a younger audidence.
B007NZQU72|5.0|It's nice to know I am among about 20% of all creatures who are highly sensitive and that this research was finally done so people can stop calling me &#34;too&#34; anything and start reading this book instead! LOL. Seriously though, it's great to have context when living within a culture that would try to convince you to be like all the rest of the supposedly homogeneous group. That's just silly. We are all unique and still connected at the same time. One group is connected through being highly sensitive, sometimes via a sense like sound or touch, and sometimes in other ways like socially or emotionally--and Ms. Aron has done the research. Woo-Hoo! Good book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|And the list goes on about 50 Shades, this is one of the few books that are so intense that you'll get up in the middle of the night to continue reading. Because you have to know what happens next and you can't put the book down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't think I could love Downtin Abbey any more than I did after the first two seasons.... but I do!!  I am in love! His long do I have to wait for season 4??
B0063IH60K|5.0|Almost sorry I downloaded this as now my husband wants the Kindle while we're traveling and I can't read my book! A good quick game of Solitaire - very quick to play a game or two to distract you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is so addictive I can play it for hours the only thing is that it restarted so I had to start all over.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I like it bond fan watch it in the movie theater like it good bond movie  must watch bond movie
B006LSZECO|4.0|Tired. The ending didn't quite do it for me. Would say more, but wouldn't want to spoil it. A good read.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love this HBO original series so buying it on Blu-ray was a no brainer. I watched the whole thing in one weekend and loved every minute of it!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is probably one of the best apps. I've played to date, anyone who hasn't played this app. is really missing out, I also play it on my X-Box 360, another great way to pass the time, and also get alittle excercise as well.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />ral
B00B10ENBA|4.0|Argo was very nearly the movie I'd hoped it would be - great writing, directing, and acting. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and Ben Affleck is proving himself to be an A-list director. I can't wait to see what he does in the future. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 5-star review was the ending. Without spoiling, I will say the &#34;chase scene&#34; at the airport was contrived and unrealistic, drowning the impact of the movie overall. But STILL, an excellent, excellent movie and definitely worth the watch.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a really good free app., I'm a 80's buff of these types of video games, and love to play it, especially at night before I goto bed, it's a good time passer, when you just need to relax and not concentrate so much on all the things that you have to do each day.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />ral
B0029LCJJS|2.0|This could be a top flight series with superb cast, outstanding costumes, and excellent acting. My big drawback is the graphic sex scenes which overshadows this series. Definitely not  family entertainment, which is too bad because this could be a wonderful informational show for the entire family but one I am uncomfortable with.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Well written, great novel,lovelly femle chracter, wonderfull values  my daughter and i read it and we love sharing our favourites parts of the story
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a movie you can watch every few years and still thrill at the ability of these gifted actors to take you to that time and place. It will go down in history as one of Hollywood's greatest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome app not only for your kids but it's a great game that adults can also use and enjoy.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Has not crashed ONCE, is automatic in scanning anything that I download and telling me that it is OK, I love that, it makes me at least feel safer and more secure, whether I am in reality or not.  lol  Recommend this one.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It was first one dollar and now it's free. Now I wish I got it earlier. They did the same thing with the amazing Spider-Man.
B004OZZ624|4.0|The movie was a little slow laying the ground work for the story line,but it paid off later on in the movie which brought me to my four star rating,I didn't love it,I wouldn't buy it,but it was worth watching for me,just for the &#34; What if this happened to me&#34; factor .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy and fun, it has square roots Pi and fractions. it takes up the whole screen which makes me smile.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Its pace kept up with past Bourne movies even though Matt Damon was not in this movie.<br />I would recommend it to my friends.
1451695195|4.0|I didn't know much about near-death experiences till I read this book. I found  Dr. Alexander's report valid and convincing, a confirmation of what many people of faith believe will happen when life on earth is over. I believe Dr. A. overstates his case however. For example, he wrote at the end of the prologue, &#34;What I have to tell you is as important as anything any will ever tell you...&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  I don't buy the extra coins.  I just let them build up in between plays.  You could get very wrapped up in this game if you bought the extra coins.
1891252089|4.0|I have been practicing yoga for half a year now, and I just can't get enough of it. I'm as interested in the asanas as in the philosophy of yoga. I bought this book because it is required in most teacher trainings and I thought it would be a good guide. And it is!! The poses are very detailed, the pictures very descriptive, and it also includes short forms of 15, 30 and 45 minutes, for not-enough-time-for-the-whole-series people (where I include myself). Doesn't have the five stars because I am missing some anatomy tips, how you have to feel the pose physically and what you are working, like muscles being strengthened, internal organs being massaged, part of the body being stretched... that can be found in other yoga books, though.<br />I would definitely recommend this book!!!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Now the story is beginning to gel.  More action, more suspense, more info on the dynamics of the Cullen family.  Going to watch Part II tonight...
B009329Y30|5.0|Awesome movie, real good chick flick. A moving story that should be loved by all . A great gift for your girl.
B00AHH0XOY|5.0|Was so fun and great for some chuckles gave me a huge warm feeling inside of the center of my body and the kids loved it
0545259088|3.0|It is hard seeing the final book of a beloved series be released, knowing it means that is it for your favorite characters. And the worst is if your started the series with the first book, waiting a year or more for each installment. After a few years, you look forward to that last book with as much anticipation as dread. That is how I felt about Forever, by Maggie Stiefvater, the conclusion of the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.<br /><br />Grace saved Sam from becoming a wolf forever by injecting him with meningitis, which fought off the wolf. Bought what neither of them expected, was that Grace was becoming a wolf. The horrible fever she had as a child that stopped her from shifting wasn't permanent. Just as Sam is cured, Grace is lost. Without Grace, Sam is completely lost. it doesn't help that Grace is officially missing and the entire town, Grace's dad and the police included, think Sam killed her. But there are bigger problems in Mercy Falls than Grace and Sam. Isabel's father, seeking revenge on the wolves he thinks killed his son, has finally won his petition to remove the Mercy Falls pack from the protected list and organize a hunt via helicopter- one where the wolves will have no chance of survival.<br /><br />With Grace, Beck, and the others out in the pack, Isabel, Sam and Cole are desperate to find a way to stop the hunt. Cole takes a different means of attack by trying to simultaneously find a way to catch a wolf (Grace in particular) and cure them or turn them human again (even if only briefly). While Cole's ego is tough to take at times, his devotion to Grace and Sam leads him to practice his concoctions on himself. Even Isabel, who can't admit she loves him, thinks he has lost it. What they don't understand is that Cole has never really had family before, and he considers them family and will do anything to save them. When the hunt is moved up, they must do anything to get the wolves to safety, even if it means trusting people they never thought they could trust. The fate of the Mercy Falls wolves are in the hands (or paws) of a few teenagers. Can they pull it off?<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I was underwhelmed by this story. The excitement of saving the wolves was basically ignored (with the exception of Cole) until the last quarter of the book. Most of the book was Sam pining for Grace and Grace unable to control her shifting. It left me a little annoyed with the main characters and more interested in the chapters about Cole and Isabel. Cole's character is the most interesting, with his crusty exterior and complete, surprising devotion to the people he now calls family. Otherwise, the story was very slow until the very end. I was surprised and expected more from the final installment of this series.<br /><br />The story is appropriate for any middle school through high school student. As the last piece of a trilogy, it won't make much sense without having read the first two books. I am sure anyone who got this far will want to read the book to finish out the series. I was, however, very happy with the ending. It was bittersweet, but I think it ended well.could trust. The fate of the Mercy Falls wolves are in the hands (or paws) of a few teenagers.

B003Y5H4SY|5.0|WOW.  I mean, WOW.  Watch this movie in the dark with headphones or a home theater.  Turn off your cell phone.  Focus.  You will be scared many times, and you will probably cry at the end.  And as the credits role I promise you that you will have an entire different outlook on life.
1429218207|4.0|This book was just what I needed for my  class.  Great condition.  Better than what I expected it would be when I orodered.
B000Z8KAUM|4.0|It's tough to follow Ocean's 11 (but kind of easy to follow Ocean's 12); this end to the trilogy is a lot of fun to watch.  Admittedly not as good as 11 but bringing Al Pacino into the movie was a evil genius.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love this CD. I can always count on this CD to make pick up my spirits. If I have had a hard day, I use it to relax me.<br />I would recommend this CD.
B0042KA4VO|5.0|Love this show really enjoyed it read all the books doesn't always follow exactly but really enjoyed ithope you do too
0757302661|5.0|Great! Used this with my last baby, had all natural quick easy birth. If you are pregnant buy this book. The CD is amazing.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down & I am so excited to dive into the 2nd book.. I just wonder what happens when they get back to district 12 & their families!!!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and enjoyment for the family. I like just about everything with Robert Downey jr in it.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I have been waiting for the blu-ray version of this movie for a while.  It is a very well written, directed and produced story of the horrors of the holocaust and at the same time paid homage to Mr. Schindler, wonderful man who found a way to make a difference and save the lives of many.<br /><br />The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.&#34;<br /> -- Albert Einstein
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|keep up the good work! very good game top to bottom. I could play this all day. makes me want a green beer tho
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As an author Nicholas Sparks is tops!  Once I started reading this book, I stayed up all night until I finished it -- and suffered from sleepyness the whole next day -- but it was worth it.  Now I think I'll go see the movie and see if it's true to the book.
1593272200|5.0|First of all, I have never written an Amazon review on any of the previous books I've read, however this book is so amazingly wonderful, that I feel the need to share my excitement!<br /><br />I have never learned so much about the internals of Linux, and UNIX, in general, in such a short amount of time.  Nothing is left out!  It is well written and very easy to comprehend. I can honestly say that this book has made me a better C programmer.  Not only has this book given me the tools to create Linux applications with ease, but it has also given me the motivation to continue learning the internals of Linux.  I'm only about halfway through the book and am already excited to continue learning about everything the Linux kernel has to offer!<br /><br />The Linux Programming Interface is a very large, very comprehensive book.  Nearly every system call (and associated library functions) comes with a complete, fully functional example program; it's not like other books that simply show an excerpt of a function's use.  On top of that, the freely downloadable source code is available on the referenced website.  These programs come with even more code, showing how to make the program completely portable across other UNIX systems--literally, no shortcuts are taken.  I am truly amazed by the effort put forth in this publishing.<br /><br />Even after I finish reading this I know it will remain by my side at all times.  It makes for a great reference (I have already used it as such multiple times).  The table of contents is well organized and the index is very complete.  Plus, the exercises at the end of almost every chapter helps to reinforce the knowledge gained in the preceding chapter.  These exercises can be used as \\"refreshers\\" when the time comes to create production code.<br /><br />Obviously, the code in this book is in C, so if you're C knowledge is lacking, I recommend you check out [[ASIN:0393979504 C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition]] by K.N. King first.  Once you understand all the subtleties of C, and you're looking to learn about properly interfacing with the Linux kernel, you then NEED this book!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The best. Very  imaginative and great use of using new science to entertain. I am hooked on the series. It is one of my favorites.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Get ready for a conclusion to the trilogy that takes your emotions on a rollercoaster ride.  I might have given the book five stars if I wasn't so darn depressed right now.  What that indicates is that I cared what happened to the characters, so I'll have to congratulate Ms. Collins on a job well done.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|I bought this for my husband, and he loved it. I always like getting cd's and even movies off amazon, it's so much cheaper for the same stuff!
014241493X|5.0|This book is in perfect condition when I received it yesterday.  I am already 80 pages into it since last night.  Hard to put down.  I highly recommend the book and the seller!
B00009RGBS|5.0|Great movie I recommended 120 percent it's my favorite musical of all time. If you haven't seen it you should.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I have seen every episode numerous times due to reruns, but I love it so much, I had to buy the seasons.  I love the humor and wittiness of the show and Sheldon is one of the best characters ever written! I also have a BAZZINGA tshirt!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I loved the Lost show.  It is probably my favorite show ever.  6 seasons of cliffhangers and deep stories.  Getting to know each and every character was such a joy.  The show looks fantasic on Blu Ray.  The packaging is really cool.  There's a &#34;secret&#34; compartment in the box that hides a bonus disc.  I found it because my box was broken and the latch fell off to reveal the disc.<br /><br />Awesome show on an awesome platform.  If you're a major fan buy this.  If you're just curious check it our on Netflix first.  Then I'm sure you'll be making the purchase after a few episodes.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Jon's philosophy is greatly needed today to help us block out much of the commercialism ,shock and crime in the movies and on TV. Fortunately we still have books, but much of what is written in them is only  shown rarely on those medias
B008OOYALE|3.0|Without spending any money, you are pretty limited on the kinds of dragons you can buy. It also takes a long time to make enough food on the farms to grow your dragons, but some people seem to have figured it out (or else they are pumping money into the game). Either I'm not very good at figuring out the secrets, this game is pretty lame, or both!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love, love, love this series and I recommend it to everyone that I talk to!  I never buy dvds, but I had to have this one.  I also bought season 3 the moment it came out.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Love love love, such a great show, i can't wait till the new season. Love love love love love love
0525958002|5.0|My wife loves Duran Duran and loved the book so I took a read on it and its great! Worth every penny!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I rented this movie because I remember seeing the tv series when I was way younger.  It was alright but not what I remembered.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was my first experience with this game. I found out that my grandkids are into this game and that there are many products on the market that go along with it. I've had fun &#34;sharing&#34; with the kids and sending them little &#34;bird&#34; products.
0307719774|5.0|i had a friend movie away and i thought this would be a great way to curb her anxiety, and it was a great way to look at where she is now
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed these games. There are so many to choose from and are different than the original games....
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I enjoy watching Troy so I had to have the disc.  I found it on Amazon for an unbelievable price and with Prime I didn't pay any shipping.  It is a two-disc DVD and I got it for around $3.00.  Even if I hadn't liked the movie, it would still be a good addition to my library at that price.
B00942YBQ4|4.0|was an amazing love story but the end leaves you hanging they should have added more to the ending that's why I only gave it a 4 star movie
B000P0J0EW|5.0|A strong and compelling movie, I found it entertaining and not at all boring. I have seen before and will watch many more tiimes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it has everything from fashion to food recipes and gives you great ideas to wipe together quick snacks or great dessert
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is one killer movie if you like a little older suspense movies.  Hot cars, hot women, hot asphalt, cops hot on his tail.  Don't miss this one, people!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have had facebook for awhile now on my pc the only down fall on amazon espcially if your looking a facebook thru your kindle is that all the post are super huge and there's no way of minimzing them to see the whole pic someone post
B000062XGG|5.0|Gotta love sci-fi action thrillers like this one.  Will Smith is top notch in this futuristic alien space film.  Several great actors in this one.  Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.  But hey, I'm a Will Smith fan anyway.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|I like it. Good CD and excelllent range of songs. I recommend the CD to anyone who likes the movie and it's m usic
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I purchased 'Expendables 2' as a X-mas gift for my dad, who LOVES the movie.  One of these days, I'll have to sit down with him and watch it 'cause I do like all the actors as well as great action films.  By the way, I ordered this at the very last second and Amazon made sure that I received it before X-mas. Thank you, Amazon.
B006GKHE6G|1.0|The tilt function to steer does not work on the Nabi 2.  Very disappointing since this is my 3 year old son's favorite game, and this function does work in the demo game. Please fix.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|... and she loved it, just as she does all of the Twilight films.  She has the entire saga now!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another DeMille good read.  I learned a bit more about Yeman as well.  Sounds like quite a place in the middle east.
0394800389|5.0|I remember my dad reading me Dr. Seuss books when I was a kid. Here's hoping that my kids find as much enjoyment with these as I did.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Wow!  Eye opening and alarming.  Really makes you think about where and what you buy.  I have a new appreciation for the family farmer.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have to say this book kept me guessing as to what would happen next.  There is so much action for each character.  I was shocked at two events in this book (ha! no spoilers here).  It's creepy about the Others and the wights coming in such numbers and no information yet as to what/how/who is controlling them or originating them.<br /><br />The only storyline that I don't care much for is Danerys.  While I like her, I was grossed out about the details regarding her army of 'Unsullied' soldiers.  And some of the city conquering that she is in charge of was abit too easy.  She is supposed to be only a young 16 or 17 year old, yet she has the wisdom of a 50 year old woman.  Dany was heavily sheltered her entire life, so it makes me wonder where she is pulling all her foresight from.  I loved the book regardless.  I find it very difficult to turn my Kindle off at night as I want to read until I have finished the book.<br /><br />I  read all the Harry Potter books. I personally feel each book is written by different authors, trying to sound like the original author, but failing to capture her quirkiness of the first book.  Book 2 was very boring and slow.<br /><br />Each Game of Thrones book flows smoothly from one to the next, all from one mind and one author.  Not each character gets equal time, but I've liked  different perspectives from the good and evil guys.  Some of the  evil guys are really, really dispicable.<br /><br />This series does more than satisfy my thirst for a fantasy series since the demise of the Stargate franchise and Star Trek series on tv.  I hope we see at least 5-10 years of Game of Thrones.  I just bought the Illustrated Book and hope this enhances my enjoyment of the reading and tv watching experience.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|3.5. Why has this become my most common rating lately. It's not that the book is bad necessarily but it changed so far in direction from what the series start out as. The series began as a Dystopian story with a pretty strong love story and a very interesting premise that love is a disease that could be cured and therefore prevented to make humanity more even keeled and predictable. The second book was Lena finding herself and her role in the resistance with a touch of a love triangle thrown in because  hey that's what all YA series do. The third is all about the resistance finally making progress with Lena taking a large role and virtually no love story. I know it's probably difficult to pursue a relationship on the run but Julian is out resisting, and Alex is brooding silently most of the time until the very last second when he declares himself, gives Lena a feathery kiss, and curtains close. With all the stormy feelings that would accompany the life in this revolution, I would expect a little more emotional or even physical release at this moment.<br /><br />On the other hand there are a lot of themes that could have been developed more but once again, I felt the YA classification holding the author back. The book is a little more violent than most YA, but hey this is a revolution. Violence is to be expected and maybe there should even have been more in the book. There is a last minute brief exploration of faith, which showed potential and some poignant writing, but heaven forbid a YA novel start to get a little deep. Even the idea of the deliria cure not working would have made for some interesting pondering. The chapters by Hana I found most interesting as it is clear that the cure works by wit of a placebo effect. I wanted to read more about that.<br /><br />The ending of this book is open and leads to believe and to fear, somewhat, that publishers will pressure Oliver to write another one. The ending definitely left me feeling something was missing but I  don't think there is another way to continue unless the series comes out of YA ties that bind.'t think there is another way to continue unless the series comes out of YA ties that bind.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi is a touching story about the love of a dog for his master, and his undying loyalty tugged at my heartstrings.  Any dog lover, or anyone who has a heart, will be touched by this movie.  I rarely feel the need to own a movie, but I wanted this one to share with friends and family.
044024613X|3.0|&#34;This book kept popping up on lists of &#34;books you might like&#34; on websites so I thought I'd try it. I'd go with 3.5 stars. Until 2/3 of the way through the book, I would have given it 4+. It's really a tight thriller with a devastating premise. The District Attorney's 14 year old son is accused of the brutal murder of his classmate who had bullied him. What really got me at the beginning was the literary quality of the writing in addition to the exciting thriller element. It started out to be a condemnation of the legal system, a theme that was dropped and picked up throughout the book. It promised a disturbing but fascinating picture of a family falling apart, and it delivered that too. It makes you question how well you really know your kids.<br /><br />My problem was a feeling that things began to unravel at the end. Maybe it is partly because I am used to a neatly tied up bow after the resolution of the conflict, and this book didn't give me that. It resolved and then ratcheted up the tension again right afterwards. This development threw Jacob's character development across the novel off. We could see he had the potential to become a psychopath only near the end with the psychiatrist's evaluation. That only several pages later, we see that he is indeed a fully formed psychopath, at the age of 14, made me feel the characterization up till then wasn't true enough. There was only circumstantial clues to this psychosis. If he were really as far gone as he proved to be, there were no clues along the way. In addition, is it possible for such a young person to already be a serial killer? My second problem is with the actions of the mother, Laurie. What she does at the end seemed out of character.&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and I am glad I did because the concept of the story would have been difficult for me to fetch. I enjoyed it so much that I borrowed the second book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favorite app on my kindle I love it and I love the world tour it is so cool and it is so fun
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A compelling script with interesting well developed characters, not to mention a host of solid performances.  These films of Wes Anderson's have layers and call out for repeated viewings. I look forward to many more films from this wonderful director.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Good cpu fast reliable, The heatsink included with this cpu was hard to latch i had to use a alot of force to latch it afraid i was going to break my mobo, other than the heat sink this is a very good cpu if you look at benchmarks it does keep up with FX processors and even performs better than some considering this cpus age thats pretty significant!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I can see how this game might be unnerving but for me it just didn't make sense due to no direction or objectives to reach. The controls and tilting of screen were hard to manage again without direction.<br />Once I turned and the slender man was in the distance and it said game over. !???<br />I might have missed instructions somewhere but if so they are not obvious.<br />If the game had the objectives then I would try again. Until then I feel its not a game just walking around listening to creepy music words and pop goes the bad man and game ends.<br />Uninstalled<br />FloridaMom
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's a great game but I lost all the work I did the first time I was doing just fine and then the next day I got on all my stuff was gone not happy about that
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Lavish production and beautifully shot!  The performances are terrific.  A little too much gratuitous sex for my taste or it would have had five stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!! So addictive!!! So much fun!!! Ok . Really enjoy This game B-) have lots of fun on it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ummmmm I like it but things are waaaaaaaaaaay too expensive and you barley make any money!!!  Other than that I like it! Its a pretty good game. I like how the money you get doesn't expire because your not going to be on it all the time.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's a sweet game but it needs tons of updates-<br />1. Some spots you can't walk up on (map glitch)<br />2. In the cemetery, there's a spot that makes you fall straight down<br />3. Controls are blotchy<br />4. Slenderman is glitchy<br /><br />Like I said, awesome game, just needs lots of updates!! :D
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Just goes to show that Denzel Washington is a very good actor and can play anypart,  almost as good as American Gangster
0345410025|2.0|i should never impulse buy  this one just didn't fill any of my expectations  most likely it was an &#34;at it's time&#34; book to read
B00AG51V8E|1.0|did not like this movie at all, was a waste of my money,  would not recommend to anyone, not a good Bruce Willis movie
B003MC5N28|4.0|I chose the rating less then I hoped for.It took me awhile to figure out what was taking place,in regards to the way the people were living,in their world.But once I figured it out,it was very heartwarming.I would say  it was a scientific read.All I know whom have read it,have enjoyed it.The ending,was a bit difficult to understand.But I would recommend it.It was a different read for me.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved this movie it is so worth the money. The story behind all the striping is so good the way he is trying for somthing better and he almost has it just to have to give it away to save someone else, it is real good and the half naked men don't hurt either
B009POCG2C|5.0|I watched this film last night with a friend..I had no idea how much this film was going to affect me, and i am STILL thinking about it.Haven't so many of us had a dad like that? or similar? we feel AMY ADAMS pain, and how the resolve it is unexpected..we expect to get one scene where they work it all out, get all the bad stuff out, but it doesn't come at all. Don't miss this film, watch it with your family, you will not be sorry..except when it ends.I will NEVER look at peanut vendors in the same way again..WONDERFUL FILM..DAVID IN PA
034580404X|5.0|The story behind all the BDSM is really good. The way it evolves is so great, at first it is a slow read and you are thinking man I hope it gets better than this and it so does...I so recomend this book it is a great heartworming story that has a lot of kinky sex in it..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's one of those rare books that catches your attention from the get-go. I loved it from beginning to end.  I was touched and teary-eyed while reading some of the chapters.  It was that engrossing! Highly recommended!
B0080CL0HM|3.0|If all you want to see is Robert Pattinson have lots of intercourse with three different women and being a jerk then this movie is for you. It is kind of boring I get that his parents were poor and he grew up poor and wants more for himself it is the way he goes about it that is so bad..
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I Loved this book! There are some surprises and I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say buy it or download it and enjoy!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This disc froze at the same scene each time that it played and the pixels became scrambled during various chapters.  Disappointing.
0062127241|5.0|this was a great Xmas gift for my husband, he didn't know this had been written, and really enjoyed reading it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Excellent movie.  Denzel Washington did an excellent job in this movie and there's a great supporting cast.  Watch this movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really fun and the ads do not get in the way.  Great way to waste time when you have a list of ought too to get done!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Needed to decorate for prom was able to get a bunch of ideas and it is so nice to keep your ideas all in one place to go back to. LOVE IT!!!
B0094D462M|5.0|This is hopefully going to be an all time classic movie. The dogfight scenes are well put together. The F14 is an awesome weapon system.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This is a good read if you are a cronic procrastinator like myself. It is basically a kick in the ass to remind you that you should be out working instead of sitting at home scratching your balls.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is the best movie ever, my daughter and I loved it! We laughed and cried. Cannot rave enough about this movie!
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|The book focuses more on the main character's internal world. I wish the movie did too. All in all, not bad. They did a great job with his last days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its just so wicked man!!!! I wish i had made the game in it fam!! Its as crazy as temple run, maybe even better shoombla!!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The second in the series. Few books have held my interest to this degree. Highly recommended, but only if you have extreme discipline of your time, or a series of uninterrupted days to read.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Real easy to find the books you like to read.  Selection is great no matter what you are looking for.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I tried the demo a while ago and even though I liked it, I felt there was something missing... you need to experience the whole game to see the scale and epic proportions of such journey that will captivate your heart. Even my 3 year old daughter enjoys playing the game!
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|You can get around in it with less back tracking.  Everything in one place is the only way to surf.
B008OOYALE|5.0|its a great game but I just wish it didn't take so much to clear your land... maybe they could take it down a little
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should really get this game<br />If you like temple run get!!! It<br />I got all of the updates New York!!! Rio!!! And Romo<br />Really fun game
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I am not a cable subscriber and so this is the only way I can watch the show easily and inexpensively.  The quality is good and it is reliable.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read.  You do not realize the trained and talent that we have in our military.  This novel is so true to life.  5 stars!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I strongly recommend this show to anyone the writing and story progression are top notch. i know a lot of people might be turned off that there are zombies, but it is NOT a zombie show. It is a drama with zombies in it. do yourself a favor and watch a few episodes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. The graphics are excellent, the game fast paced, and it's challenging. This is definitely a hand-eye coordination game so if you don't care for those, this isn't the game for you. But if you do like that kind of game, I would highly recommend this one. Very addictive!
0062014536|3.0|I loved the first two books in the Delirium trilogy, but this last book made me so mad at the end.<br /><br />I loved the writing and the pacing until the end. Just like another reviewer said, it felt rushed at the end like she had to quickly write it so it could be sent off to the printers. I felt like it was an open ended ending. IT felt rushed and hurried, and there wasn't a lot of action. There wasn't a lot of romance (which I liked and disliked at the same time). I just feel really disappointed for buying this book, only to be let down in the end.<br /><br />So, my final thoughts are that if you want to read this book, then go get it from your library. Don't waste your own money on this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you've played the first version of this game, you will love rev 2. Even more challenging than the first! Great graphics and a lot of new stuff - new tools you can grab in transit and new moves. Like the first game, this is a hand-eye coordination-type game.
B001TH16DS|5.0|what I enjoyed most about this DVD is the fact that you have the best of both worlds. You have the unenhanced version and the computerized enhanced version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfed because it is fun and I am able to be free and run.Everyone should play this game because it's so addictive and fun.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|what I enjoyed most about this DVD is the fact that you have the best of both worlds. You have the unenhanced version and the computerized enhanced version.
B000002G30|5.0|The music on this great album truly is magnetic!!!!! Almost every track on this album is great, with only a few fillers and some less than desirable ones. Monster Magnet is a very interesting band on to itself since they draw so many different influences. They are a mix of old school metal like Black Sabbath and Pentagram, and also old school alt-rock like Pink Floyd, King Chrimson, and also Windhawk, which in the opinions of a lot of people is the 1st band 2 blend science fiction with rock music. The image of monster magnet is also something that has also been changing from album 2 album. In this album they still had a msytic and somewhat dark image of the band. Getting on 2 the music, this album has some of the best songs Monster Magnet has ever written such as the title track Dopes to Infinity! The song is heavy, catchy, and has some of Dave Wyndrofs best lyrics! Negasonic Teenage Warhead may have a very odd and strange title but that is another great song by Monster, again very heavy but has more of an alt-rocker sound. Then there are the hidden gems on this album like Blow'em off. This song is really deep and focuses more on a persons revealing self image and what happends when you do not help those who have been there for you. It has a Bassline that like the minds of this great music is out of this world! Look to your Orb for the Warning is another underrated gem on this great album. It has a very solid guitar riff that drives through out the track and some of the strangest time signatures, and the song is just great. I will save the rest for you when you experience this great album. If your a fan of Monster Magnet then this album is a must, or at least just check out some of the tracks that are on it. A great album from a great band!!!!!
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for ages and was delighted to find it as a Kindle Whisper-Voice option. The narration is nicely done and the historical information is well detailed, never boring. I found myself so involved in the story that at times was talking out loud to the narrator. I want to listen to it again and take notes. This book should be taught in schools. After reading/listening to Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, I know will purchase more of Dee Brown's books. Very well done!
B008M4HANQ|2.0|Yes, you did read the title right. The story is a very interesting take on the legend that is snow white. However; it doesn't can't live up 2 what it should have been. The story was very long, and I found the characters 2 really lack depth in their acting. The CGI speciel effects were good, but you see it so much in movies as of late its nothing 2 write home about. Save your time and check out the Lord of The Rings movies, or some real fantastic classics like Legend, Willow, or one of the most unqiue of the genre Krull.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The game is pretty good. However when walking around it keeps stopping.  I'll be walking forward and it will just stop. I'm playing this on the second gen kindle. If it wasn't for this issue i'd rate it full stars.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was my first hidden object/adventure game and I had trouble putting it down. I highly recommend this game. I would like to see more like this one.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|They have captured the emotional struggle, and sometimes absurd and ridiculous reasoning, by which the addict thinks.  I esp. like that they developed the character's nature of free choice; he chooses to drink, albeit because of his deep pain, but nevertheless he is cognizant of his destruction.  Drinking is the only disease I know of that is cured instantly when the addict stops raising the bottle to their lips.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I am a great fan of this author however this ws just not his best in my opinion. But still a fan
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I looked at temple run when I turned on my kindle fire and was like that looks like a new app. its now a picture of a camera or something and I even tried deleting and re-installing Temple Run and it didn't change. I tried revolting my kindle too. Please Please Fix
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I have the Super Mario game for WII, so playing this game did not leave much to be excited for, but for those who have never played a Super Mario game, this is a great game to start with.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just love it all, brilliant acting, brilliant writing, thoroughly entertaining. No tips just watch them all! And my name is Grantham!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and really captures the scene and fun for people any age. but for kids its very fun to play
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Everything worked great and it turned out to be a great gift for my GF and the price wasn't too bad
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Found the game boring.  Not much to it and wasn't overly impressed with graphics. Cheap thrills but not a challenge
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I watched it twice ...thinking I missed something.  Fell asleep both times.  Not sure why Argo won the Academy Awards ... Lincoln was soo much better ...at least it kept me awake!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was a great one day read. It was a typical Nicholas Sparks story, but well with the read. I always like to read the book before seeing the movie and I did this with this book as well. Now I'm looking forward to the dvd release of Safe Haven. My adult daughters said the book was much better than the movie but I'll watch it anyway (:
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's really good I like it. The graphics are so good and the game is really fun it's entertaining when ur bored a rate out of 1-10 I would give it a 8.  :) I hope this was helpful BTW: this game is to good to be free
B004S3MB2U|5.0|It is a great app. Very easy to use. Many functions. Easy set up. Great price. It was the free app of the day.
034580404X|5.0|Loved it<br /><br />1
B0039OC64M|4.0|This film recreates the darkness and despair of Orwell s novel quite well. With superb set design and  casting, I would rate this double-plus good.
B000002J6H|5.0|First, I can't believe how ignorant the Amazon reviewer is. Stephen Stills is and was the most talented musician of all 4 of CSNY and he holds his own with them as a songwriter. He also had a beautiful voice and it was unique!<br />This album is timeless and will take your breath away today. I never tire of hearing it. Stephen Stills is one of the most<br />talented musicians to ever walk this earth and I believe his legend will only grow. Buy this album!!!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Great movie, pretty good story, thought it was great seeing characters from a lot of old games I used to play with personalities.
0375842209|5.0|I read just about every available young adult Holocaust-themed book when I studied the Holocaust in sixth grade, so I've seen pretty much every possible point of view. \\"The Book Thief\\" was new and fresh in comparison due to two features: Death as the omnipresent (and omniscient) narrator and an underground railroad that comes from the perspective of the German helpers, not the Jewish refugee.<br /><br />Zusak's prose is beautiful - instead of attempting to describe it, just read a chapter or two, and you'll see what I mean. I was afraid that the style he used would cross over into \\"purple prose\\" territory when I was reading the first couple of chapters, but he managed to straddle the fine line between emotional description and over-the-top imagery.<br /><br />Another point that speaks to his ability as a writer is that he basically reveals the entire plot within the first section of the book, yet you still feel the full emotional impact as the events Death describes occur.<br /><br />The one negative aspect for me was that it took me two or three tries to really get into the story, since the setup was vague and failed to pull me in until the fourth or fifth chapter. But once the story actually starts, it's hard to put the book down, so I recommend waiting for a time when you have an afternoon or two to read.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|So I was trying to make a vid and I selected 1080p and it crashed. I found help on the app and it told met<br /> To force close and clear all so I did but now the camcorder doesn't work. Please help.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is pointless.  You run around using crap controls while some cheesy music that is supposed to be&quot;scary&quot; is playing.  The five star reviews must be fake.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This is a very good, thrill packed adventure worth watching.  Don't miss it.  Brutal at times but those times were very brutal so face it.
B0061QD88S|5.0|It is a story without violence for children. It is funny; it has music. The animation is excellent.<br />I recommend it to young children. The story is easy for them to understand.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Very compact and light weight. Breaks down into one handy unit which includes the stove and pans.<br /><br />One fill cooked a pack of hotdogs, and a second fill of the until boiled a can of stew. It really saved my bacon on a soggy camping trip.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Watched this movie with my husband and son who because of the title weren't sure they wanted to watch it. But I have to say we all ended up really liking it. It was one of the better movies we've seen in a while. Very cute and loving sorry about some unexpected high school students who end up becoming very good friends. We thought it was a very good movie!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|The additional footage really changes the story. I loved The Professional as a kid, but I enjoyed this version even more.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|3.5 stars, I rounded up.  Somewhat predictable events, but still somewhat entertaining.  Goodman and Arkin add character and humor almost as an aside to the movie story.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Tremendous brand, company, and customer service. I've been through 2 Scosche passports in 4 years that never sounded quite right, even when working. I have a 2008 Volvo C70 and am using an old 32gig iPhone 3G as a music player. (The Volvo needs this type of 12 volt to 5 volt translator, as do many other older cars.) Ordered this from Amazon with 1 day service, since I'm going out of town for a week. It came on time, along with a 6 foot dock extender cable (in case the old one had been compromised...if not, I can use it with a sounddock). Products came today as promised (Amazon has always been terrific for me for a number of years with their customer service). Just plugged this in. wired in the cable, and it works, without the constant wiggling that the Passport required! (It's nice when something goes right.) And, the sound is noticeably better. Scosche does make some good products (or at least used to), but not the Passport.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show about a post apocalyptic alien take over showing the strength of humanity. Can't wait for the new season
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I didn't like the book as much as the series.  For one thing 200 pages is not really a book.  I like to read and I like a few more twists and turns in a mystery.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A highly experienced hunter-killer meets the battered newbies in the sky over Germany. In only a few minutes, one German and  ten Americans lives are indelibly changed by an unlooked for and almost unnatural reaction by the German. All these lives, preserved for the future, will be indelibly marked by the actions of one honorable man, caught by circumstance in the 20th century's  greatest cataclysm. It is an almost unbelievable set of coincidences that brings these men together and then lets them return. For those who know little of the German side of the war, this sheds light into the unbelievable challenges that faced young German pilots. Thank god the Germans lacked the industrial base of the allies.
B003THHIEM|4.0|I enjoyed watching the first season.  I had forgotten about the beginning episodes. The enter action between Beckett and Castle is great.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy facebook. My whole family uses it. Iwould recomend it to frends. I enjoy seeing what everyone has to post. have also found some great sights.
B005O7PXNS|4.0|I really like this season.  I liked the way it ended and then was taken up in Season 5. Now that they are together I hope Abc doesn't mess up next year and do something to take them apart.  The characters are a lot of fun to watch.  The reason I like the show is because I like mysteries and comedy mixed together.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I loved Skyfall! It's seriously one of the best Bond movies in years, and Daniel Craig was terrific! I don't buy many movies, but I definitely bought this one.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I was looking for a good series of crime stories and especially enjoy the Scandinavian feel.<br />This story, although set in Australia, has this feeling. Good and entertaining story.<br />Recommended!
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a book that you just don't want to end.  A well documented internal and physical struggle at the same time!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good historical novel. Interesting story of a German girl growing up in Nazi Germany. Best quote \\" he had perfected the art of promise keeping\\".
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a game that even us old people can follow and enjoy as we go.  I found it full of excitement, the graphics were good and the storyline easy to understand. I am hooked on G5 games!
B004UHSB5A|2.0|I love playing dominoes, but there is nothing about this game that makes it fun. The dominoes are tiny, it's hard to move the pieces for play, and I can't figure out the scoring.  I wish I hadn't wasted by money.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she just loves it!  The message of the movie is, if you want something bad enough, then you fight for it.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|This is an awesome gathering of Florence & The Machine Songs. A couple I pitched out but to find an artist these days what you like 90% of their songs is hard to come by. She is great!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read third book troug school, but it was so good that I finished it 3 weeks before we has too, and wanted it to be longer! Love this book!
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I admit to being hesitant to spend $300+ for a flash..it was worth it. Read the clear instructions, pushed a few buttons, attached it to my D5100 and instant communications. No fiddling, no set up other than setting it to auto, slip it on, lock it down, perfect exposure. Bounce it off the ceiling or wall indoors, use it as fill outdoors, the camera and the flash have communicated each and every time with great results. I tried the $59 to $99 dollar 2nd and 3rd party flashes with poor to mixed results, could have saved myself a fair amount just purchasing this first. ( I'll never learn, I have three of a lot of things)<br /><br />It is powerful enough for the average to advanced consumer, has amazing recovery speed from flash to flash. If you're indoors with a few lights giving half the light you need it'll recharge fast enough to expose the 4 shot burst in a second my D5100 outputs. Other than the battery door it's solid and robust (dropped a couple times and keeps on flashing) just take care with that battery door.<br /><br />One more thing the SB-700 thrives on standard eneloop rechargeable batteries. I have a host of different rechargeables both low discharge and regular high capacity rechargeable. Of all the different brands and types I've used the eneloops are outstanding in terms of number of flashes and recovery time. Don't use regular alkaline batteries unless it's an emergency...the SB-700 will eat them like candy putting a dent in your wallet. One of these [[ASIN:B004J6DLD4 La Crosse Technology Alpha Power Battery Charger, BC1000]] and a set of these [[ASIN:B004UG41XW eneloop NEW 2000mAh Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 8 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]] and you'll have all the power you need.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing book really interesting can't wait for the next book to come out in 2013 . Loved this book so much
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is definitely in my top 5. I loved the underlying romantic theme and could not put the book down.
030758836X|5.0|The best book I've read in the past couple of years.<br /><br />A \\"whodunit?\\", or rather, \\"did he do it?\\" with constant twists and angles and insightful descriptions.<br /><br />Love the writing style. The characters were constantly developing and changing. Each half of this troubled couple constantly juxtaposed against the other. Just fascinating.<br /><br />Because it didn't garner favorable reviews from everyone, even being so wildly successful, I was prepared for the ending perhaps not being what I, and I expect all those disgruntled others, wished it would be.<br /><br />But the final two sentences quickly ended the impending doom of the novel not being tidied up so neatly. Just had to laugh out loud after reading the end. Gillian Flynn redeems that impending doom with one last bite of humor. Hurrah!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I really like all the different functions from speed and distance to quantity conversions. Definitely the calc that does it all.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|Looking forward to season 3...  Very good season 2, just not the amazing season one that can never be duplicated....
B00005BGV2|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is one of my all time favorite albums. From front to back, Tool has crafted a masterpiece of music and emotion that is rarely seen in music. From subtle, intricate tones to roaring, in-your-face metal to mathematical theorem inspired time signatures, this album has it all. But since there are plenty of reviews that speak to the musical quality of this album, I will confine my review to the actual physical product.<br /><br />The presentation of the vinyl edition is stunning to say the least. It comes in a 2xLP holographic gatefold jacket, and the artwork (as with any Tool release) is breathtaking. The front and back covers and inside of the gatefold are adorned by holographic circles of eyes which are fascinating to look at in the right lighting. The slip covers contain the same pattern, but not in holographic form, as well as a chart themed track listing and credits. The discs themselves are works of art. They are fully illustrated with four different stages of a face in profile stripped away at various layers (bone, tissue, organs, etc...).  Trust me, they look simply amazing on any turntable. The only reason that I give this product four stars instead of five is because the records themselves are a bit noisy. Apparently this is a common issue with picture discs, but I don't have enough experience with them to speak to this. It may just be my copy, because the second disc has considerably less surface noise than the first.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly reccomend the vinyl edition of this album to any Tool fan. The art and presentation alone make it a must have for any serious fan of the band. The surface noise is tolerable, and only really noticeable during the quieter parts of the album. As I said, one of the most phenomenal records ever recorded.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie. it was very realistic but some of the language was not good specially for kids
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Glee gets better and better every season. I love the way the Glee creaters, writers, and producers have incorporated Lima and NYC. I wish the season would never end.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is awesome I already have 36,000coins I can't wait to get frizzy that's<br />What I'm saving up for
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Purchased for grandson...he likes it. He has several Lego sets and enjoys them very much. Will continue to purchase Lego.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|The film is a distraction from everyday life, but I found it to be beneath Diaz' other work.  It's just a soft-porn hack's version of cinema.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so addicting! If can't help but to play in non stop! I just can't put it down!
B00005LK94|4.0|I bought this film because my lady friend adored the story, and I made her a present of the DVD, so she could watch it anytime she wished.  Anna Pacquin and Jeff Daniels had good chemistry, and the animal actors were a lot of fun.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have this book on my iPad and have not completed reading it.  So far it continues the saga and having it on my iPad is a very convenient way to carry the book.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|This film is excellent, particularly if the viewer likes the &#34;mysterious&#34; relationship between man and his equine friend.  As a &#34;horse person&#34; myself, I enjoyed the story and the weaving of the characters, animal and human, into a moving story of travail and triumph.  Some might find it schmaltzy, but there are some times in life when life is really like that.  The incredible coincidences notwithstanding, this is an uplifting film.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was a gripping read, in spite of the fact that I'd seen the movie and knew most all the facts set out in the book.  As a caucasion woman, I've discussed and shared this book with black friends and we have found it to be of equisite interest.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in our country's history.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A little predictable, but great story.Cant wait to now see the movie. I hear they stayed pretty true to the book.
B00498YZH8|5.0|jennifer lawrence, you are amazing! way better in this movie than in Hunger Games, and I liked her in Hunger Games a lot. Kinda depressing, but so real and deep. The story seems like its not hollywood-made but taken from actual people, actual families. My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.
B0058SNI9O|5.0|Bought these for my daughter that is 6 months pregnant and she loves them.  As usual with Crocs, they are very comfortable, light weight, helps with back pain but these are cute and stylish.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 year old says it is better than the first one.  My 4 year old loves watching but says it is too hard for him to play.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is a great game! First off the control system is something I've never seen and I'm a huge fan. takes a second to figure out but functions well. It will get your heart pumping as well. I was skeptical when I started playing. I didn't think an app game could scare me, but that slender man made me jump out of my seat!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Bought this for my 7 year old.  She played it and then moved on to Angry Birds and Where's my Water.  I played it....and got hooked.  Great entertainment for a 40 year old.  Not very hard but fun to play.  A bit addicting... I just can't put it down!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is really fun and addicting. It does take some slight responsibility and time if you really want to achieve things on here.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good writing....holds the readers attention.<br />Compelling story, plot well woven. Would like more of stories with same characters. Enjoyed the book.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|Watched it for the acting. Skip the story.. A most  unlikeable group of characters with no real meaning or conclusion.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I find it hard to believe that this is their debut album, as \\"An Awesome Wave\\" is one of the more breathtaking albums that I've heard in a long time.  As someone who voraciously runs through albums and moves on, I have been listening to this record on repeat for weeks now.<br /><br />The first three tracks (\\"Intro\\", \\"Interlude 1\\" and \\"Tessellate\\") all blend together to make an excellent opening suite and I often find myself repeating those three before getting to the rest of the album.  They set a somber tone but other stand out tracks like \\"Breezeblocks\\", \\"Fitzpleasure\\", and \\"Taro\\" display their poppier side.  Like later period Radiohead, of whom they have been unfairly compared, they marry the synthetic with the organic to stunning results.<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant debut album and would recommend it to anyone who is into modern alternative such as \\"In Rainbows\\" to current era Radiohead, Tame Impala, and Beach House.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|All her stuffed animal bears are named Mordu now! Too cute! It's a great movie to teach the value of family relationships to young ones.
0307463745|5.0|This is a fast read that packs a punch. I recommend this book HIGHLY to everyone. It's a book that will challenge how you think you should work, but frame better options in a very memorable, enlightening way. Loved it.
B00005RRHC|3.0|First seen in 1992 it was fresh and funny - seeing it 21 years later I had difficulty sitting through it to the end. Particularly bad is Emma Thomson's very over-the-top portrayal which is ridiculous by today's standards.
B005USZML4|5.0|...and older ones, too. When I bought this book for Kindle, I didn't realize it was part of a youth series. The story was very good and kept me interested all the way through as most Grisham novels do. I will read more about young Mr. Boone.
B007Y612KA|2.0|We are seniors and this one was a little out of our age group.  I did not like the effects and the way the movie was made.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This was my first book about Theodore Boone and led me to others. I really enjoy his approach to cases.
B0094K1K42|2.0|In my case this is the type of person who I would hate to be around.  A very spoiled female who just never did get it so why would I watch a movie about such a person.  I guess I am just old.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|If you are a fan of this type of movie you should qwn this one. The action is fast. The actors play their part well
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Outstanding.  This is a page burner.  There is no doubt that this book is a book that reflects are current world situations with other countries.
B0017VQB40|5.0|I saw this as a child with my mother like the storyline and the music. Favorite song I am so pretty
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Fun movie to watch at least once.  Had good action and kept interest.  I would have given a different title.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm glad amazon is around. I had heard about downton abbey but missed it when it aired. My wife and I watched season 1 and 2 on amazon. What would we do without you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great story. Once you start reading this book nothing will get done until you finish it. On to the next book. Thank you Nicholas Sparks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, this program got me hooked immediately. I am looking forward to season 4! It is a must see.
B001HN6922|3.0|We purchased this disc used from the seller. It was advertised as being &#34;in excellent condition&#34;, however when the disc arrived, it had a severe scratch on it that made an important scene in the middle of the movie unwatchable, damaging the whole experience. Because of lack of time, we were unable to contact the seller for a replacement, so don't hold it against him. That said, this is the first used DVD that I've bought (and I've bought several) that turned out to be damaged. I'd say that's a pretty good track record!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Creates a wonderful image in your head. I would recommend to teenagers to older women. I'm older and loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it, addictive earn coins take care of horse, kind of like farm ville only just one animal...addicted to it, takes a long time to dl...takes up space on sd, but so far no problems with that
B008MG1E4A|3.0|If you are interested in this type of book you should read it. I really only cared about the UBL raid. I wanted to know what happened before I saw the movie that just came out.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very interesting story that definitely becomes more gripping as it develops. There's a sense of uncertainty present that is both claustrophobic and exciting. I like that as the reader, we're dropped into the middle of a story that is revealed only as we follow the characters. When you finish this omnibus make sure to follow with the next of the series, the Shift Omnibus. So good!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Creates a wonderful image in your head. I would recommend to teenagers to older women. I'm older and loved it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The more you read, the more layers appear.  The reader gets to know each character fully.  But, towards the end, one realizes all is not what it seems.  Mr. Landy, being a lawyer brings his expertise of the law making the color of the book more interesting. The characters are described so that the reader gets to know how the arrest of their son for murder affects them.  Each parent is affected differently.  A great read for those who love family stories, but also those who are lovers of courtroom drama. I actually believed the boy was innocent until the questions that surfaced after a young giril was murdered while the family was on their Caribbean vacation..  The construction of the book reminds me of several Steve Martini tales.  I couldn't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really good I play it every day to earn<br />More and more money pleace help me get more
B005HSL626|3.0|Fruit Ninja is just another tablet based game. It's okay to pass the time until another generic game comes along.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I have downloaded this app and cannot work it. O would appreciate it if someone can explain how to use it on the kindle fire. My email is msmary_113@yahoo.com. Thank u
1419702238|5.0|This was the best series of books i`v ever red:)cool  I'm glad someone thought about this series cool I'm so happy<br /><br />Hey
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This was an easy read and look forward to the release of the book from the male perspective which I believe is released in April 2013.
0307236722|3.0|I do use this book and found some recipes to be easy and good, however I am always running to the store to buy products I do not normally have on hand. Some of the recipes are very fiddly.  Great tips in this book and for that alone I love the book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it has very good graphics and it is a very fun game. I play it all the time and I'm hooked on it for a hour atleast.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I read the first book Delirium and was not impressed. Decided to read Pandemonium anyways and started to love it. Anxiously awaited the third book and it was GOOD! It was getting even BETTER...and then the ending. It wasn't an ending at all. I'm left to wonder what happened between Lena and Alex! They were my favorite and even though I liked Julian too, I really wanted Alex and Lena to be together...and now I will never know. Who knows what happened with the resistance either. The wall was torn down. Great. Then what??? What happened to Hana??! Do her and Lena find each other again? Does she join the resistance?? Is Fred dead? Ahhhhh!!! Lauren, you NEED to make another book, pleaaaase!!! Give us something more to work with. I can't believe this is how it ends!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|So far it has met my expectations. came in a good amount of time. Easy to use. I would reccomend it.
B001N8Q6V0|3.0|Firefox is a good \\"mission impossible\\" style suspenser, slow to start but overall well done and entertaining, despite some pretty cheesy music. (It's remarkable how much music can either help or hurt a film.)<br /><br />The quality of Amazon Instant Video was disappointing: very jerky. That really hurts in the action sequences of a film like Firefox. I get better streaming on the exact same hardware from various TV show websites. I won't be purchasing Amazon Instant Videos again.<br /><br />So, good film, but either download it or get a physical disc. It loses too much immediacy when streamed, at least with current technology.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really can't improve upon all the excellent and enthusiastic reviews already posted - can only say: I agree! What they said! :) It is a lovely piece of work.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I give up, how could anyone possibly give this 5 stars?  You wander around collecting notes for some reason until you die for no reason.  I must be missing something, but it's too stupid to even try to figure out what I'm missing.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good story, well written, good segue to follow-ons<br /><br />This will likely be my last review.  Too many requirements to pass the stupid software monitors.  I don't have time for this.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|ok but what is stopping me from taking one of those cars and drive away<br /> and that's it I win.
078401213X|5.0|\\"Pi\\" as an Allegorical Explanation of Life<br /> As a film concerned with the explanations of life's inner sanctums, its reason for existing, and man's role within its borders, \\"Pi\\" unravels nebulous borders, conveying within its galley the allegories, mystic bridges, and religious underpinnings which score our senses, while  successfully opening our eyes to unrealized passions. Within these un-secured parallels  the questions still unanswered, yet closer to our minds, in a film considered a genius epic, undertaken within a maelstrom of mistrust and self-loathing analysis.<br />Take for example, the duality expressed by our protagonist's immense desire for security and secrecy i.e. a multitude of door locks and his desire for complete academic openness, as indicators of man's classical battle between trust and distrust. Additionally, the total disregard of the venerable 216 as the true name of deity, while concerning himself with its focus on the idolatry nature of \\"Pi\\" reflects the demonic duality with angelic forces, as foretold in the Holy Bible.<br />Upon viewing, one can plainly see the self-destruction of his computers as an attempt to free contemporary society from the rigors similarly dealt with in the Garden of Eden through serpents and rounded fruits, while the numbers bandied about through stock market manipulations clearly relates those presently living with post- Apocalyptic dissipation of our current days' diminishing totals. How clear it becomes to liken his being told \\"Take a bath or there will be only chaos, never order\\" to the societal cleansing required to re-structure contemporary life in a self-effacing manner.<br />Only with a scrutinized vision can one interpret the film's depth and care for analysis and retribution toward self. When performing his mind cleansing lobotomy he relinquishes his hold on the structure and knowledge afforded to a select few while developing the ability to smile when speaking to a child. Are we not being castigated for viewing the world around us through our cerebral acuities while ignoring the passions of our heart? I think that the oft repeated visual of a removed brain being repeatedly stabbed and poked in rapid order affirms that query. The making of a classic film, told through symbolism and stretching the peripherals of our own boundaries can be clearly identified upon its viewing.<br />The use of spiral to signify the epiphany of life and its continuing struggles help define the nature of this film as it meanders through Freud's cabal of Id, Super Ego, and the manipulative and societal securing Ego to both explain the intellectual struggles and shifting compasses of moral turpitudes with which we approach our lives. It is with these identifiable and subliminal messages of text and vision upon which this film operates. Its beauty, horror, and self-effacing mockery perhaps defines us and our search for placement in this and other possible universes perhaps more clearly than any other current film. The progress established through its parables and the questions raised through its visions are why \\"Pi\\" should be considered  a select film, best reserved for those seeking honesty and the hidden structure of the smallest pebble on Earth, while still bowing before the graces from beyond.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I needed both a basic calculator and for that occasional challenging number crunching session something with more horsepower. This calculator delivers on both requirements.
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book as a child, and now wanted to pass on the joy of reading and interacting with it to my kids.  Remember poking my fingers through the holes in the food and imagining the hungry Caterpillar doing so as well.  Lovely surprise at the end.  I like the fact that it's a board book, which gives strength to the pages while trying to put your fingers into the holes.  But with a board book, the pictures are smaller.  I don't know that it's a problem, if the child has never experienced otherwise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Every chapter had a cliffhanger that makes you wanna read it all.<br />I have read the whole series twice because it was so good.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Still that great voice but some of the songs were not album material.....more like fillers to have enough to create another album that his label knew would be purchased just because all the others were really great.
B002R5HR70|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. Rest in peace Whitney Houston you are missed.  Video quality was excellent.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was so suspenseful! The characters developed well over the books in a believable way toile this book fantastic.<br /><br />I'd recommend for all readers.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I hadn't watched a John Wayne movie for a long long time. I remembered this one from when I saw it as a kid. This is one of the &#34;Hey you in the jail&#34; series of John Wayne westerns. Great old fashioned Howard Hawks straight shooting western. Young James Caan was likeable and kind of fun as an inexperienced dude ex gambler. Ed Asner nicely dark as the bad guy. Christopher George as an odly mannered gun for hire. Robert Mitchum and Wayne - too much testosterone to jam into the frame. As always good looking women sprinkled around to hang on our heroes. Kind of a throwback movie but really a hoot if you go for a great old western every now and again.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|I have really been enjoying this music - never owned any J. Lo. before, and am surprised at how much I'm liking it.
0062209493|5.0|I recommend this book because it's very personal memories of the man who loves country. The book talks about inside out of the military operation in Iraq and how its affected his life. The guy is proud and I like this. Real Texan boy.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|I am so glad to have found this book!<br /><br />This is an excellent resource for all bilingual families. Easy to read and follow, a first hand experience mentioning also research results, this is a must read for all parents who want to raise bilingual children.<br /><br />It changed my thinking and now I realize that it takes a lot more effort than I thought, bilingualism doesn't just happen by itself. Both parents need to commit to raising their child bilingual /multilingual and it is a daily job. It made me realize that I need to plan now, what resources I can use, who are the persons that can help me, how to make it interesting for a child and not imposed. It also got me to appreciate more my friends who managed to raise their children bilingual.<br /><br />Plenty of creative ideas and speaking from own experience of a loving parent.<br /><br />I would recommend it to all future parents who are thinking of raising bilingual children and especially to those who have a more complex situation with more than two languages in everyday environment. Even if you are not convinced that bilingualism is beneficial for your child, read this book, it will probably change your attitude.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|This album is perfect, musically, vocally and lyrically.<br />Beyoncé is one of the few mainstream artists who get involved in all aspects of her work, making it her own and you can feel that in the music.<br />This album and &#34;4&#34;, are her best and if you don't like them, I don't know what it takes to get your attention, but Beyoncé's pretty much amazing.
B006HL9G10|5.0|this app is amazing! the sounds are great it sounds like youre actually in a rainforest meditating i love it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|My reading time with my Kindle is too precious to waste on whining, self-serving characters...and in the end, I didn't care if he killed her or not.
B005HGKWLO|5.0|This movie is awesome. Loved it!! I recommend watching. It is a great chick flick for those of you who like them.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|The book is well written and has a ton of useful info in it. It's really helped me a lot.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play.  It's very relaxing for me when I'm not reading.  If you love spider solitaire you will like this.  If you've never played it helps you learn.
B005R32L66|1.0|2 second Echoes, and never wants to connect. Uninstalled! Tanjo works much better and they don't want credits for every littlething you want to do.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm not a big game person but I love having them on my kindle for when I just don't want to read.  It's nice and relaxing!
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|Great album I would highly recommend it. They are one if the best bands out and I purchased all their albums.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  We all enjoy watching Grey's Anatomy!  Can't wait to be able to get her all of them so we can start at the beginning and watch until now!  We DVR the current episodes!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This movie was originally rated R, with good reason. Some of the scenes will stay with you long after you have finished watching the movie. It is graphic, and it is realistic. You will see innocent people being murdered and there is no sense of justice for them in the end. That was, sadly, the reality of the Holocaust.<br /><br />With that warning, the movie is definitely worth watching at least once in your lifetime. I think children in upper grades should see it as well, so they realize that the Holocaust killed 6 million individual people, who had lives and personalities. This movie drives all of that home when Schindler makes his \\"list\\" of employees he decides to spare from death.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I normally don't like reading biographical type books but I really enjoyed Bourdain's story of his journey through the restaurant world and simply, his love of food throughout.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love the CD.  Opens strong with Brave and conitnues on through a great variety os songs.  It's one of those albums I don't have to skip over the songs I don't enjoy!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have enjoyed reading Mitch Albom's other books much more than this one.  I never felt any connection to the characters and was just glad to get through it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i enjoy playing this game after a stressful day.  Helps me to relax before bed time.  I would recommend to freinds
B00112GVFO|2.0|Best part of this movie is the first scene that featured a Civil War blockade runner. After that, its pretty much a flop.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Just like Frankenstein, this book should be a required read for anyone who follows the movies and is interested in the original story.  So much better than any of the movies, this book deserves the acclimation of one of the classic science fiction/horror stories of all time.
B007SGM084|5.0|This has been one of the best series i have read in a long time. I have also purchased for a friend
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My grandson (age2)LOVES this movie!!! Sits with no problem then talks with me about it. SO CUTE!! I would also say to get Gruffalos Child. Both are Wonderful
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Solid read. Not the best book by Grisham but still worth reading. Look forward to the next book by this author.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this keyboard app. It truly is the best one I've used. Have it on my phone and tablet.
B00AA0U046|5.0|200 Gram vinyl double album a value at 29.29 with shipping.  Beautiful insert with great pictures.  Comes with anti scratch/anti static sleeves.<br /><br />You know the music is great, won't even go into that.  Fantastic product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is the most stupendous superb awesome game ever! But it is way too easy for a name like leperchaun world
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Good story for young people -- Rick Riordan has excellent ways of keeping the tension.  My 11 year old grandson is fascinated by his stories.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Slow but fun<br />Some are REALLY tough to do!<br />Definitely does not get easier as you go!<br />Wish there were more hints available.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Would give it 5 stars if not for the constant refusal to load because this is a great game with killer graphics for an Android app.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The adventure, despair, triumph, and heart filled pages of unbelievable courage are brought to life in  a tale of all tales you'll never forget.
B008JFUNAU|5.0|Making a prequel for such an iconic fantasy and beloved film as the Wizard of Oz at first glance seems like just more grist for the Hollywood mill, but said assumption couldn't be farther from the truth.<br /><br />Oz the Great and Powerful (aka Oscar Diggs) is a magician in a small, traveling circus who is good at fooling an audience, most of the time, and sweet-talking the local ladies.  The latter becomes a source of trouble as an angry boyfriend, who just happens to be the circus strong man, prompts Oscar's hasty departure from the troupe via a hot-air balloon and bad luck turns worse when it flies right into the path of a tornado.  By some twist of fate, or divine intervention, Oscar finds himself not only alive but in a strange and beautiful land where magic is more than sleight of hand and its local residents, including three lovely witches, mistake him for a heroic wizard and either a potential savior or threat, depending on the point of view.  Many people found in a similar situation would probably stumble around in denial and disbelief but Oscar is a performer of the first order and subsequently cons his way through just about every fantastic or difficult situation thrust upon him all the while struggling to suppress the true hero buried deep within.<br /><br />James Franco in the lead role brings his usual intensity with a hint of gravitas, a healthy dose of light-heartedness and a smile that lights up the screen; he's utterly convincing and captivating as both con-artist and hero and I believe this role was perfect for him.  I thought the film seemed well-cast all around but let me just comment on another dual role I particulary enjoyed; that of Theodora/ Wicked Witch of the West (as portrayed by Mila Kunis) because this part was just so pivotal to the story and a remarkable performance really helped to buoy what at times edged towards a one man show.  Cinematically, the land of Oz is a feast for the eyes and even more striking when set against the B&W opening (used to full advantage as with the original), the creature FX were stunningly perfect including the terrifying flying baboons as well as Oz's newfound traveling friend Finley the flying monkey, the wizard duel towards the end was brief but visually exciting, the finale was so creative and it demonstrates the solid writing behind this film and I just gotta admit that little China Girl completely stole my heart.<br /><br />I have no doubt that many professional critics will write this one off as light fare but for me it's films like Oz the Great and Powerful combined with exceptional actors like Franco and innovative and distinctive directors like Sam Raimi that help to restore my faith in the modern, American film industry.  In the end this movie just made me happy, I left the theater with a huge smile on my face... I really can't recommend it enough for people of all ages that enjoy a good fantasy-adventure or just great cinema.  :o)pening (used to full advantage as with the original), the creature FX were stunningly perfect including the terrifying flying baboons as well as Oz's newfound traveling friend Finley the flying monkey, the wizard duel towards the end was brief but visually exciting, the finale was so creative and it demonstrates the solid writing behind this film and I just gotta admit that little China Girl completely stole my heart.<br /><br />I have no doubt that many professional critics will write this one off as light fare but for me it's films like Oz the Great and Powerful combined with exceptional actors like Franco and innovative and distinctive directors like Sam Raimi that help to restore my faith in the modern, American film industry.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Very action packed and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I love match 3 games. This game is challenging, but not so much that you want to stop playing. I would recommend it.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|Twisted ending. It's a novel that doesn't really come together until the very end. Leaves you wondering. A quick read
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was buffering so much it ruined my experience. I have excellent Internet service at home and can't imagine it had anything to do with my cox Internet. This was solely an amazon issue. I think I am done watching instant videos from amazon.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|The auto charger did not fit the opening in the cigarette lighter, nor did it fit the adapter I have in the car. It was larger than the openings, so I could not use this product.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This is just a bad game.Not awful, just bad. The controls are annoyingly frustrating: switching between pan &amp; move. There is no direction on where to find notes, no map to tell you where you are or where you can go. And I don't know why anyone thinks this is scary. Uninstalled.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|i recieved this in a reasonable amount of time and was way more than i expected i give this dvd cd combo a thumbs up
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|creepy but shakey contols. i would have given this five stars except for that. also, on the road level is a modern tardis. lol.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|What a wonderful love story. It also had great humor. I like just about any movie with Patrick Swayze in it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game was so good that I had to buy the full game it was so fun me and my brother love it we can't stop playing it!
B003UGLCIA|5.0|I like this movie as much now as I did when it first came out. It's one of the first horror movie's I went to see at the theater.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Interesting characters and setting, but too clever by half. It was also hard to follow at times, because time and place kept changing.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I rate this game A for AWSOME because it is extremely fun even to teenagers if you want to kill the bouardom
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Love the the game. The artistic buildup of the armor, equipment, and weaponry is simply amazing. The game's storyline is creative and exciting. But I was hoping for an online multiplayer game. Like an RPG. When I first started to download the game, I was hoping to travel all around a random world, complete many different types of quests (and the main quest). Plus, I wanted it to be an online multiplayer game. If it was I would say this is the best game I have ever played :)  Plz, take my comment and make the next DUNGEON HUNTER the best experience ever.  ^.^  Sincerely, Devin ?????:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing. It's not like any other Nicholas sparks books I have ever read!!! It is a must read
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was chosen for our February Book Club offering.  It was very much enjoyed by all. Left room for much discussion.  I liked how one chaper was on the family and the next was on the scientific side.  It was a book I thoroughly enjoyed, so much so, that IS downloaded it on my Kindle so that I could lend the book to a friend to read!  This book tell the story of segregation and Civil Rights in America in a totally different way, and shows the continuing impact of how things were done then and what affects lives now. Ethics, greed, morality, education, science, and economics are woven into this book to leave you to ponder the way things are done.  Most highly recommended!
B0036S4B2G|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It really makes one think about the events that have shaped your life.  I have given it to all of my family.
B000FCK65W|5.0|A much simpler time,  a much harder time a hundred years ago.  The joys and struggles of a young girl and her family, and how the struggles shaped their character.  Very well developed characters.  Just the story of life, as told though the eyes of a young girl who seemed to have nothing going for her, but the strength of her mother and the tiny bit of love she got every so often from her alcoholic, weak-in-character father.  You wept with her, you cried with her, and you cheered her one.<br />Don't let the fact that this is an old book stop you from savoring it's wonderful story of a bygone era.  It is a treasure.  You will love it, I'm sure! :-)
B006HL9G10|5.0|I really enjoy this app, even though I don't meditate. Its very relaxing, but helps me to refocus and reduce stress. The bells sound pretty realistic given the generally poor quality speakers in a tablet.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The game is fun, but I find a bug. I was walking from  the cemetery towards the building on the hill, staying  right against the map edge, and fell through the world. I managed to get a screen shot I'd the developer is interested.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|One of the biggest problems I had with \\"Predator 2\\" was that it abandoned the atmosphere of the original \\"Predator\\" movie. As for the AvP movies, forget it.<br /><br />Well, \\"Predators\\" has a completely different cast and setting from the original... yet it successfully captures that grimy, sweaty, blood-stained jungle quality. The difference this time is that all the humans are also vicious killers of one kind or another, and strong performances by Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne and the rest keep us invested despite the nastiness of some characters.<br /><br />Eight people find themselves parachuted into an unknown jungle: Royce, an American mercenary (Brody); Isabelle, an IDF sniper (Braga); Hanzo, a yakuza enforcer (Louis Ozawa Changchien); Nikolai, a Spetsnatz soldier (Oleg Taktarov); Mombasa, a Sierra Leone death squad member (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali); Cuchillo, a cruel cartel thug (Danny Trejo); Stans, a serial killer on death row (Walton Goggins), and a seeming harmless doctor named Edwin (Topher Grace).<br /><br />At first, the eight people have no idea who they are doing there, or how they came to be there. They have even more questions when they realize that this jungle isn't even on Earth.<br /><br />But that isn't their biggest problem: someone is following them through the jungle, and slaughtering these seasoned killers one by one. Also, there's a crazy guy (Laurence Fishburne) who may be a lot more dangerous than he seems. Their only chance of survival is to somehow kill the alien Predators that are following them -- assuming they don't kill each other first.<br /><br />When I first heard of \\"Predators,\\" my first thought was that it sounded more like a remake than a sequel. But it does successfully twiddle the original formula -- the humans are all professional killers, none of them know each other, and there is no safe haven for them unless they are able to somehow get a spaceship. Even the \\"obfuscate the heat vision\\" scene is turned on its head.<br /><br />But at the same time, director Nimr&oacute;d Antal and producer Robert Rodrieguez GET it. They know why the original movie worked, and they successfully twiddle the formula without losing what makes it good. The story is simple and mostly straightforward (with a few easy-to-predict twists), with the sweaty, bloodstained atmosphere of people trapped in the jungle.<br /><br />The one big problem? Well, halfway through the movie we're introduced to the idea that there are different breeds of Predator, and they hunt each other as well as other species... it's never explained enough. It's a bit confusing.<br /><br />I was initially skeptical of the casting of tall, skinny Adrien Brody as the lead character, but he's frankly pretty awesome -- a lean, wiry, cold-as-ice guy who has a soft spot for \\"nice\\" people. The gravelly Batman voice is a little off-putting, though. We get it, you're tough.<br /><br />And the other actors all do brilliant jobs, fleshing out their characters --  each one gets pros and cons to their personality, no matter how repulsive they may be. Braga and Taktarov are especially good as the only \\"good\\" people in the group, who seem to have stable compassionate personalities, while Changchien manages to make a likable, interesting character out of only a handful of lines and a truly awesome kendo duel. And yes, Grace has a wonderfully chilling performance set apart from the assorted soldiers and enforcers.<br /><br />\\"Predators\\" catches the tone and atmosphere of the original \\"Predator,\\" then twists around the entire formula.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! I'll start playing it and become completely engrossed! Is a great way to pass the time.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great for young and old. One that I will rent again or end up buying. No question it's worth seeing again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good for scifi fans, and suspense/horror fans alike. Overall a quick, captivating read.  I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So mean, really mean, President Snow is the devil in this world. Never nice at all, well, to his subjects in the capitol he's like the holy grail. I still loved it, this is the second book and I thought the first book was unfair and just mean towards Katniss and the other districts. It's weird how he calls all the old victors back for the quarter quell. I think this really adds more suspense to the story. I love how this book starts and ends, I also think you will to.
B004PR71JC|5.0|My kids love this CD, as much as do I. The music is fun and conjures up memories of the movie. It's fun to dance to also. I'm so glad we got it!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Loved the music of Sugarman (cross between Jose Feliciano and Dylan) and the mystery surrounding him from the perspective of another country. Riveting with a happy ending, and oh that hauntingly beautiful music.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written book giving a glimpse of what it was like to grow up German during WWII... Loved The Book Thief!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The performances were excellent in this film, but it contained disturbing sexual scenes and there was a vagueness to the plot and characters that seemed like we were being led around aimlessly with  no resolution and no point to be made.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Works most of the time. When video loads correctly it's good, but sometimes it's difficult to use. Maybe I just need to use it more?
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Thin story-line. Stereotypes. Junior high level movie. Embarrassing Glee rip off that misses its mark. Might want to save your money.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book and can't wait to read the next two. The way the characters evolve is great and the suspense keeps building.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have finally caught up on Downton Abbey and it is absolutely wonderful.  You can love and despise the same character, depending on what the situation.  Kudos.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must for anybody who loves video games and especially Zelda. A lot of encyclopedic knowledge inside!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I would totally recommend this one... there is a lot of hidden object games but this one tops them<br />and I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 Games +31 has some really fun games to play when you have nothing else to do on your free time!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ive wanted this app foreever and now that its free im geting it. So scathe and good graphics.<br />So check it out its amazing.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I watched this one many times 20 years ago. Almost knew it by heart. I am a huge fan of Jim Henson's work. My daughter had NEVER seen it until I bought from Amazon. Thought David Bowie was creepy, but really loved the movie. Great video. Great price. Great movie.
0553386794|5.0|I watched both series on tv first and then decided to read the books.  I have more insight into the characters from the book.  I think the series stays very true to the books.  This is not fast reading for me since there are alot of characters, and I want to understand who everyone is.  If you read the books, I would highly recommend watching the series.  It brings the books to life in a way you could not imagine.  I will continue to read all the books, but it will take me a very long time.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Love finding out what hotels are the best, seeing pictures of rooms and learning about the area you are going to
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I was hooked when I heard Next to me track on vh1. Bought the album and have not been disappointed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|While the story is kind of predictable it is also wonderful. There are just enough twists and surprises to keep it interesting and you can't help but hope that the good guy wins in the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There was so much tension between the characters  that you can  feel it.  I was rooting for them to be together but they get torn apart again and again. It was an emotional roller coaster ride.  I couldn't put this book down. It was an easy read.  When I finished, I found myself rereading certain parts just to relive the emotions.  I can't wait for the male lead's version of the story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am completely enamored with this show. When I watch, I am completely enthralled and saddened when the episode is over. This show makes the royals authenitc, caring people and I love the interspersed stories of the servants.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|First couple of seasons were really good. Last 2 were stretching things a little.  All in all it is a good show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! It's really addictive and I love the world tour part! Powerups and characters are a bit pricey but I play it so often it doesn't matter.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 not working at all. The disc keeps spinning inside and fails to play. The other parts had the same problem too, but when I take them out, put them back in (without doing anything) they played. I haven't faced this issue with the other series I bought along with this one: Matrix, LoTR, Fast and Furious, Dark Knight.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Truly dives deep into what makes Bond tick, with yet another great cast. Of course, Bond has the most screen time, followed only by Judi Dench's M. But other than that, the rest of the cast at first seems like they don't get enough screen time. However, this is not the case - their roles may be smaller, but just as significant. The action scenes are really not the highlight. What makes this particular entry standout is the wry humor, gut-wrenching suspense (shrouded in enough mystery to last you for a lifetime), and the clever homages to the older films. The best Bond film of the Craig era, no contest whatsoever. I've never seen any of the others, so I can't compare it to those, but I have no doubt this one could hold its own against whatever the earlier films (before Craig) could bring to the table. A film that succeeds at being impressive...most impressive.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Well thought out well done. Entertaining, intriguing, &#34;V&#34; was played superbly by the actor. Natalie Portman was excellent and sexy ( even in the scenes with no hair). The genre is 'comic&#34; book comes to life but it is better than all the comic book movies ( like the Dark Knight batman movies are very good, more real). fantastic dialogue &#34;V&#34;'s Sililoquy is well written and witty, intelligent movie. Great action, smart storyline.  Love it recommend it, Quality all around.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|John G. Avildsen directs yet another underdog \\"rags-to-riches\\" kind of story, much like he did with the 'Rocky' films, 'Lean On Me', and '8 Seconds'. This time, the film tells the tale of a New Jersey teenager, Daniel LaRusso, who reluctantly moves with his mother to sunny California. Of course, he is an impatient and impractical smartmouth, but the real Daniel - the Daniel that's actually tolerable, is not far beneath his rough exterior. Due to his new kid status, he is bullied by the Cobra Kai, an overly agressive group of teenage boys that are obsessed with using their own form of karate on their weaker 'inferiors'. Daniel also takes a liking to Ali, who is of course the former girlfriend of the Cobra Kai's leader. Amidst all this, he befriends the handy man at his apartment building, a Mr. Miyagi. Like everyone else, Daniel at first underestimates Miyagi. Over the course of the film, we learn that Miyagi is really a very wise man who knows a lot about karate - the less aggressive and more genuine kind. The Cobra Kai continues to torture Daniel, and he finally convinces Mr. Miyagi to teach him the ways of the ancient art. But it is not just about getting back at his tormentors - Miyagi teaches him to use karate as a way to discover himself, as well as learning about honor, responsibility, and the like. While I would agree that the film is predictable, and Daniel could get on anyone's nerves, the true magic of the story is Morita's performance as the wise handy-man/karate instructor. Rather than just come swooping in at exactly the right time to save Daniel's sorry butt, we meet him as a handy-man first, and therefore learn about him as a person before putting him into hero situations. His performance makes Daniel tolerable, because without Miyagi, I don't think anybody could stand Daniel. Morita earned an Oscar nomination for the film, and while it was highly deserved, I can't really say whether he should have won because I don't know what his competition for theaward was in 1984, without researching it. However, it cannot be denied that he displayed masterful acting talent, and the only element that made the unnecessary and very repetitive sequels watchable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games so much. It has so much passion enrolled in the plot. I love this series and would recommend this book to anybody who loves the other Hunger Games books and loves action and suspense! The Kindle Fire displays the book wonderfully as well. It's great!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I've had it for a while and it helps hold up the Kindle Fire well. I'd recommend this cover to others.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|This is a great movie to watch every so often. Even after all these years, the movie still holds up.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am enjoying this series so much.  Can't get enough of Downton Abbey! Highly recommend it for others to watch!
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|Though I could not fail to finish this book, I thought it was a bit less compelling with the story line.  Having said that, I find that the real problem I have is when the book waddles through climactic moments at an excruciatingly slow pace.  Other than that, I am still a fan and will likely read the last book.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I've tried several workout videos. This routine is one of my two favorites. I alternate this with aerobics. When I've had to miss a month or more of exercising, this one in particular helps me get started again because it is adaptable and rewarding. The background music is pleasant; the thoughtful production is interesting, and Cindy does a good job explaining. There are breaks to do a heart rate check or to prepare for the next set. All in all, I plan to keep doing this particular workout- hope it's available to years to come. Radu has been featured as a fitness coach in media a long time, adding to the appeal.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Fun, but in a unique and original way.<br />You need to watch it : nothing is expected in this movie so it's better to watch it before reading about it
B006X415GK|5.0|I purchased this doll for my daughters birthday. She has not received the doll yet but when I opened the package to make sure the doll was ok I must say she was beautiful. I think this will be a wonderful doll to add to her collection of Monster High dolls and I was able to get her at the average price of the Monster High Dolls. I was concerned at first about this doll being in just black and white as I was really looking for the one that had color to her but after seeing the doll all my concerns were gone.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|What a great album.  Falsetto is hard to pull off and not be annoying after 3 songs (IMO)... RHYE master it.  The music perfectly matches the soft voice.  Musically I can make the Sade comparison - but overall (musically & vocally), I can't help but think of Everything But the Girl.  However, they ventured off into largely electronics towards the end...  (Tracey has reined it back in with her solo work - somewhat) but RHYE recall a nice organic sound that I always wanted EBTG to maintain.  Anyway - After a few listens, I'm LOVING this.<br /><br />Standout track here for me is 3 Days.  Not sure what's going on in the story although it sounds pretty grim.  But damn, it's a GREAT song.  The vocals are perfectly layered  with each chorus...<br /><br />These songs are very delicate but never weak.  I like the 10 song offering because it leaves me wanting much more.<br /><br />listen with the windows down
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Fun game for any age!! My kids love the challenge and colors. Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun..
0439023521|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot, and I'm a man, not a 14 year old girl.  Not particularly well-written, but the action is constant and the characters are likable.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Omigosh this game is really scary! It basically teaches you how to shun people (and slenderman). If you're a beginner i recommend Road, Day, Easy. Don't listen to me and you're in trouble! Slender's coming! If you see him, look at the ground and pretend he's a pile of dirt or something. . . Good luck! Tip: If you see him too long, you're dead!
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Is it possible for BR to release anything that isn't immediately legendary, timeless, and awesome?  The answer is no.  As per usual, this album is thoughtful, fast, melodic, and perfect.  This really does harken back to their Holy Trinity of albums (Suffer, No Control, and Against the Grain) while maintaining their elegant, polished style.  Long live Bad Religion!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had heard a lot about this book, but I didnt think It would be something I would be interested in reading. I was sadly mistaken,  I could not put the book down, good read, story line a little over the top. The things a government in a make believe state can do.I will read the second book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Characters are believable and the plot intriguing with a surprise ending! I would definitlely recommend giving this a read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was absolutely amazing, Suzanne Collins is a genius. The way she turns a thrilling action book into something will backstroke, and its a brilliant love story between Katniss and Peeta, Somebody please buy the second book for me now!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was enjoyable. Kept me busy and entertained. The story line was good and I liked that it had the extra adventure.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I finished the game and it was fun. I can't wait for chapter 2. It was easy for me because all I did is I kept my head down. I saw slender 5 times.  He's watching you!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an amazing series. Just like everything else I am always late to the game when reading these types of popular books. But I bit the bullet and bought the whole series when it was on sale. Really enthralling read. You care about the characters and want to see to their safe ending in the series.  While it is not all roses and sunshine for these characters they show a strength that says volumes about them as developed characters.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|At first I was turned off 0.99$ i dont have money NOW it's free for a day get it you won't regret it
B00979JV00|5.0|I have been totally blown away and sucked into this world I can't wait for the next season! If you haven't seen downton abbey yet and have any love of period pieces this in a must watch series!
B00000DHRX|5.0|This took me back!  Great songs and voice..  I really liked how easy it is to order and get the music from any era!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has done it again! I could not put this book down! A touching story! Loved it! Now go ahead, beginning reading. You will not be disappointed!
B00005JLEU|5.0|my grand-daughter loved it. she was very happy when i gave it to her. She had  been wanting it for a long time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Truly fascinating, gripping story made even more enjoyable and down to earth due to the personal insights on his relationships with his wife and friends.
1577314808|5.0|I have been reading quiet a lot during my life. This is one of the best books ever. It is written in an easy language and I like the style it is written (answer - question).<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone. When you try the teachings of Eckhart Tolle in practice it feels amazing. I believe it can bring significant changes in life.<br />Enjoy :)
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is a really heartwarming story. Great movie, nice era piece. She should have gotten the academy award. The story is unique and interesting
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A rare book where you care about almost every character. Sad but joyous at the same time. Beautiful conversation that makes you wish you had such friends or thoughts or both.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because I miss my horse. We sold her because we had a house fire and I could not take care of her or bee ankle to ride again. The app is great it is fun and is great for teens or kids that wants a horse because it pretty much is true on what u would have to do with a real horse. I luv it.
0375413405|5.0|I loved the movie Julie and Julia so I was motiviated to read the book that this movie was about.  It is an interesting read and this used copy arrived in good condition.
1451695195|4.0|I heard about this book on TV and am very interested in this subject.  It is just what I was looking for.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Unfortunately I read this book after Chris Kyle's passing but I must say that this is definitely worth reading and adding to my military history collection. Mr Kyle speaks frankly and pulls no punches. RIP
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The last episode's finale was poor!  Killing off Mathew in a car accident?  How unoriginal when the rest of the series had such outstanding writing, acting, costuming-everything was above and beyond, but that finale was so weak!  Quite a disappointment.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Built this system for my retired mother. She plays simple games, browses the internet, etc. and it is a peppy little machine. Disk IO is noticeably faster than a sata3.0 system. boot times are QUICK<br /><br />Just note that there are some drives that this machine does not like. I originally purchased a Crucial m4 64GB mSATA Internal Solid State Drive CT064M4SSD3 and the BIOS thought that the drive had a password set on it. Needless to say, it went back to Amazon. I ended up with a Mushkin 128gb and all is well.<br /><br />Do some homework on the Intel website and ensure that you are purchasing hardware that they have either tested and verified or someone else has tested and verified. It will have you the time and hassle of trial and error; like I had.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watching this series was like reading an excellent book-so hard to put down.  I had not followed the series when it was first aired so I had to catch up on Amazon.  I watched several episodes at a time.  This was so well done.  The best drama on TV in a very long time.  Couldn't wait to see Season 3.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is so adorable I don't know what to do its a fun game for anyone any age at any time its a perfect game
B009VB7P6G|1.0|Pretty animation, but Disney has a way to go with its plotlines. Why are they aiming movies about anguished separated lovers and sisters separated at birth at three-year-olds?. Perhaps it wouldn't bother me quite so much if Disney hadn't gone out of its way with the series to make this story.
0345308239|5.0|I have read and reread this book enough to have worn out my first copy. It obviously is a favorite. The new copy is a replacement.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow. This book left me speechless. The ending had a lot of suspense, romance, & confusion. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series can't wait to see new season. I have season two and three now. I like that I can watch them any time -any where.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|great cd by talor swift. she more a pop artist the n a country artist, either way a great  cd
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|At first, this game didn't seem that interesting, but when I started playing, I collected coins and bought gadgets and jetpacks. This game has so many possibilities, so it is fun for everyone!
B00846REIS|2.0|It felt like I was reading Fifty Shades again.  WAY too close to the Fifty storyline!  Powerful rich guy with infatuated girl!
B00000IQW5|5.0|I have always loved this movie every since it came out so many years ago. Thanks for having it available.
0525423656|5.0|Interesting story line.  Took a while to get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down.  Would recommend the series.
B003XU3MWM|5.0|Very good loved it.  Great film the characters are amazing. We have watched this at least three times.  Great stroy
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|For no particular reason, human beings choose lives that make &#34;a dent in the universe.&#34; Inspiration comes from within, but confidence and awareness resonate from what we see and learn from others.<br /><br />This book is of resonance, builds confidence and awareness and triggers inspiration from within. A work of art by Isaacson which I chose to read a second time after reading Einstein's biography he wrote.<br /><br />And I will read it again someday.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|This game started out great. However, near the end of the game, you have to run from one end of the map to another alot. I can't finish the game now because it won't let me select the last object in a h/o game. Have tried everything I can think of with out success. Frustrating.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Reading this book and seeing how Mr. Kyle lived was a blessing. I'm so glad to have read this, too bad it was after he was killed.<br />One other thing I liked about this book was that he didn't go into how tough BUD/S was.. We ALL get it, it sucks, move on as was done here.
B009O2XY12|3.0|While I enjoy the game, it takes way to long for you lives to renew.  Other wise it's not a bad game.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Without repeating what others have already written, Safe Haven is a beautiful love story. I did find I got a bit bored in the middle as not enough to keep me entertained. However, the ending is great and gets you back in not wanting to put the book down to find out how it ends. Will make a great movie for romance buffs.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I wish you had more lives instead of having to wait for them to renew.  Other wise it's fun to play.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game is great, but it needs better navigation. It's not smooth as it could be and it's a bit glitchy. Other then that, it is a good game.
B009EELKMA|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. There was a great deal of action and character development. The cinematography was also excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is one of my first young adult books, as my first book by this author.  Very good and easy read..  Hopeless!!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|When I first saw this movie I didn't know what to expect. The cinematography was great and the storyline was excellent. The boy and tiger could not have survived without each other.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is with Leo a girl fairy and there us 100 levels the first one is easy addition and u figerout it out :)
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I rather enjoyed this book. It unraveled itself slowly, not in a boring manner, but as if it was peeling away delicate and intricate layers. I was easily sucked in to so many scenes and found myself standing in the circus eating chocolate mice wandering through tents or at midnight dinner parties thanks to the rich details in the writing. A few slightly cheesy lines kept me from the full 5 stars but I enjoyed the book from start to finish. It was nice to read something unique and not necessarily know where the journey was taking me while not feeling like I needed to know immediately.<br /><br />If I had to compare it to something- maybe a little bit of Heroes meets a bit of The Illusionist.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|A  book  with a lot of interesting facts like how the katana  is a great weapon or AVOID CITIES  and that chainsaws are not a good choice because what happens when you run out of fuel
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I had no idea what this game was but I tried it and it freaked me out. I didn't like the controls much, when I stopped walking to change my view or direction it was hard to get it to walk again. But anyways I was in a house on the side of the road and I was in the wrong room and when I turned around he was there and I screamed! My mom got a good laugh at my reaction tho she wasn't sure what I was playing.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Its fun and i love it.  But sometimes it freezes my kindle fire hd. And  i had to delete this app and re-download it multiple times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series certainly kept my interest.  Loved all the characters. I will be looking forward to the next season.  Kinda like a soap opera or much better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really love this book and who ever gives this book under a 4 star rating is definetely really Cray-Cray
B008602KQI|5.0|The book kept me interested, I couldn't put it down, which prompted me to watch the movie. I thought the characters were wopnderful
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Dickens was the prime exponent of Victorian literature, but he had lots of company.  The 19th Century was the great age of melodrama.  The emotions were big, the prose purple, the coincidences uncanny.  Damsels got into distress.  Sweet and innocent people died.  Foreigners were stereotypes who talked funny.  Villains were easily identifiable and got their just deserts.  Bram Stoker’s DRACULA is a wonderful example of a Victorian popular literature, in addition to being the granddaddy of all vampire stories.  Stoker invented the vampire rules (e.g., “Vampires can’t abide the crucifix” and “vampires can’t cross over water without being invited”).  Is it scary?  In comparison with films like “Alien” it’s not scary at all, but you can see how it might have creeped out 19th and 20th Century readers.  The “scientific” aspects will make even today’s children scoff.  (For example, a lady is anemic and needs a blood transfer.  The doctor takes blood from four different donors for her without ever testing any of them for blood type!)  Nevertheless, it’s a lot of fun on several levels.  Three stars and a smiley face.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great, can't wait to see the movie for this one. I always watch the movie first, then I read the book. This time I did it the other way around. The book usually has more in it than the movie, so you get some surprises. But with the Hunger Games it was pretty much on target. Hope the second movie is to.
B001OSIV62|3.0|This was very interesting and quite fasinating, especially with all of the information about the World Trade Center towers. However, my 12 year old daughter downloaded this to my kindle and I was totally unaware that the end of the movie contained a very inappropriate bedroom sex scene. I was shocked and disappointed.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I tried to follow the instructions but it won't work like when I shut down my kindle it doesn't work.so It's a pain in the butt!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I think its really fun. I have a kindle and at first it didn't work so I keep on trying then it works I like how you can buy the salt water fish and you can buy other things
B009EE1GC4|4.0|Really enjoyed this film. Good lesson on how not to act in a foreign country. The actors pulled you in emotionally.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played. One reason I really like this game is that it doesn't<br />flight or blackout.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I was looking for a great cover for my new Kindle. this one is just what I was looking for
B000002W9Q|5.0|I purchased this cd because I really like the movie and I enjoy all the songs on the movie. It was a must have cd for me.
0307730697|5.0|I hope this review will do Adam Brown justice, just as much justice as it sounds like Adam Brown brought to the world around him. I've read a few books about Navy Seals; their accomplishments, their trials, their paths, their qualities and have scene a few documentaries.<br />FEARLESS: the story of Adam Brown, too me, definately stands out on top as one of the most interesting reads about Navy Seals but not just because he had the title of Navy Seal, but because of the PERSON he was and the accomplishments he made.<br />Adams path to becoming a Navy Seal is more of an unusual one than what a person might think about when they see the words Navy Seal and what media and television has shown about them over the years. For me it only makes Adam out to be more human and his Spirit and character as a person more outstanding.<br />This book just doesn't talk about what Navy Seals have to go through to become Navy Seals, what they experience once they are Navy Seals but it also talks about in captivating detail how far one man fell at a certain point in his life and then how he pushed through his hard times to find himself,find his path, find a wife that came into his life at the right time and that helped him along the way and ultimately finding out how much character he was made of.<br />Filled with memories, incredible first hand accounts; funny, unbelievable, inspiring, from family and friends, pictures, personal journal entries makes me agree that Adam Browns life story definately had to be put on paper. A unique individual I wish I was able to know him personally but this book definately shows you who he was. Best regards to his family.<br />Joyyyyyyyy to the worlllllddd. Drum roll please!
B004TOC8HQ|5.0|I purchased this cd because I really enjoy listening to Billy Joel songs and this is my favorite cd of Billy Joels, it includes all of my favorite songs that he sings.
1401938906|4.0|The concept with E2 is that instead of reading about how our thoughts can change our life, we can test it in a series of experiments. Pam compiled nine simple tests that anyone can do for basically no cost. It is a good strategy for those not quite sure about the whole \\"mind movement\\" and if it has any truth to it or not.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because it was filled with science, but it did not talk over my head. I am not a scientist, nor do I have the background to dive deeply into every detail on quantum physics and how everything is connected by energy. I gather the basic premise, but even if I didn't have that I still believe this book would be an easy enough read to walk away with some benefit. It is presented in a logical manner that is a far cry from many \\"self-help\\" books that can be over the top with the whole cheerleader mentality.<br /><br />Also, there are many hearty laughs abound as Pam is a riot! It is entertaining because while you put on your science hat and experiment with the concept of an energy force you can also get some good humor. This is not a dry and sleepy science book.<br /><br />Overall, E2 took a topic that has been written about endlessly and managed to present it a fresh manner.<br /><br />I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes.
B000001FDK|5.0|I purchased this cd because I really like the movie and I enjoy all the songs on the movie. It was a must have cd for me.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is super scary! It's scary like yo momma at a beach! Scary like Obama with your personal credit card! Scary like George W at a western store! Scary like the Kardashians! Play with caution!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better. I was a little skeptical at first when I started S1 Ep1, but after I watched a few episodes, I was hooked. I ended up watching all of season 1, 2, and up to current on season 3 in less than a week. Now the struggle is waiting week to week for new episodes.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading book 2 of the series.  Though I felt that some parts were disconnected or slow.  Looking forward to finishing book 3!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I've been hooked on this series from Season #1 and it keeps on going strong! I can't wait to see what comes next.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I loved the movie. Great movie for a date. Both myself and my girlfriend thought it was great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|I loved this as a child just as much as I do now, Delia, he wants his cake you know!
B00992CF6W|1.0|it took every thing I build so hard on my world.fix this<br />I work this hard.then it got threw away in the minecraftian sky.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great visuals, I always love Charlize Theron, Its true what they say about Kristen Stewart's lack of true emotion in acting but it was cool
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This calculator works great. It does every since thing I need for my homework. I'm very happy with it and lucky I got it when it was new to test it.
B00B8PMWJI|5.0|This is one of the most Unique, Awesome, Fun, Visual, captivating movie I have had the pleasure of seeing. Worth every penny WILL be buying hard copy!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|For me this was one of the better concerts. Loaded with stars of past and some new and upcoming talent as well. Great chance to see and hear people of the past. As with all videos some will not like the angles of some shots but for the most part it's very good. As for the audio it's first rate and although this may be too long for some (4 hours) I didn't want it to end. My only complaint would be why two DVD's rather than one? Overall Great concert!
1451696191|5.0|Whether your still in high school or if it was more moons ago than you care to think, this book is a must read.  Well written with a lot of heart, I can't reccomend it enough.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have the game on my I phone and wanted to get it on my kindel big mistake. it glitches it stops it freezes it just awful.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app! It sure beats trying to use the calculator on my laptop! Thank you for offering it as a free app.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Frankly,  I was a little disappointed in the songs themselves, not Josh Groban.  He always delivers. But there wasn't one really great song that would play in your mind or haunt you a little.  The songs were just generic.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I LOVE this film. Just the right balance of A-list and alternate-list actors. Stunningly atmospheric settings and soundtrack, good plot, and happy ending.  But this is a dark and strange film although the characters and dialogue are so authentically quirky that it does not oppress.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game either doesn't work or I'm retarded. I got to #2 and nothing happened. I'm glad it was free because 5 seconds of play time wouldn't even be hooker worthy.
B0013O123Q|5.0|Stunning visually. When watching, pay attention to the fact the the most intense scenes are uncut: the camera never moves and the action is continuous (i.e. taken in one shot). The net effect is breath-taking.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for a few years. Could not put it down! Jack shows us how we all look at the world in a unique way due to our experience and it is often difficult to imagine life in any different way.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I love her voice, always have and I love the Phantom songs. Susan is a joy to listen to and her duets were sucessful pairing.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is great , didn't think I could find anything like Mario, but it's just as fast paced as Mario and good music behind it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Like the first season's shows we enjoyed these episodes as well but the storyline seemed a little more unbelievable and contrived and a little too much of a soap opera. Still worth seeing if you liked the season 1 series.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Amazon is doing no one a service by offering this flick for 48 hour rental.  I don't think you can watch this thing without falling asleep at least once. 48 hours is just not enough time to start stop this thing often enough to make it all the way through.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|good graphics and don't listen to the haters who call slendy silly because they probably wont write another app review ever again but this game is about as close to Pc version I have ever seen
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|As it says in the title. I downloaded this game for my Kindle Fire HD a few weeks ago. Great overall. The only criticism I'm going to make is the pushy pop-ups that encourage you to purchase oil, money etc. Instead of earning them through the game ( to be fair though these only pop up if you have a shortage of the offered item).<br /><br />Definitely worth it. Even if your not convinced, just download it... ITS FREE.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Put one of these in our entry way closet. I used to search in the dark for gloves and a hat on morning dog walks, but this works great, and i don't wake the family turning on an overhead light.  Not sure on battery life yet, but i was able to put it on the side of the closet where it is out of sght, and it either turns on when i open the door, or when i reach my hand in the closet.  Better than i expected and i am pleasantly suprised.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read in years. Safe advice, you wont regret reading this! Epic.
B0097L29KM|4.0|Nice recording from a legend performer. Has all of the requested quality drum and solo riffs expected from this Canadian performer that keeps on 'rocking in the free world'.
B003XKAZKO|2.0|How ironic that Morrissey authorizes an album re-release in cheesy packaging and modified versions of the beloved original tracks. It is like the Smiths song \\"Paint a Vulgar Picture\\" except Morrissey hasn't died yet. Talking about the greed of the record company deceiving the buying public with bait of extra tracks and the switch of the classic songs.<br /><br />Bona Drag represents Morrissey's solo career at its very best. It was the album that had a wonderful flow, inspired lyrics and skilled musicianship. Unlike Viva Hate and his later albums, Bona Drag was not recorded as an album but was instead a compilation of his singles and some tracks that were left off of Viva Hate because they didn't work with the album's vibe.<br /><br />As for being \\"Re-Mastered\\": It is louder but not really any clearer than the previous releases. The sound quality is best described as \\"bright\\" and \\"tinny\\". In other words, the sound is loud, high and flat with an oil drum acoustic. It is not any fuller or richer than the CD and less so than the cassette and vinyl formats.<br /><br />In hindsight, I wouldn't have purchased this album and it is only worth buying for the alternate versions and unreleased tracks. If you are looking for a quality version of the Bona Drag album for the songs you know and love, this is not it.<br /><br />Although Morrissey is not a dead star as described in his earlier mentioned Smiths song, he certainly is a fading star. Each album after this one loses a little bit more artistry and magic while each consecutive album gets weaker and weaker. I stopped buying Morrissey's new work after \\"Your Arsenal\\" (which itself is fairly weak and uninspired). I lost a great deal of respect for Morrissey when he assembled his rockabilly group and his live shows were clearly desperate contrived displays, surrounded with all the trappings: trite \\"ROCK 'N ROLL\\" rebellion of tattooed guitar-smashing wannabees. Replacing talent in exchange for image. So disappointed. So trite.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|A bit darker than some Wayne's other works, but that's what makes this Western so good.  It's also more sympathetic to the Indians than other westerns of the period.
1419702238|5.0|Have you ever had a friend who was just a little tedious?  Found it difficult to be on your best behavior on those days running up to Christmas?  Felt embarrassed about being bullied once you saw the bully through someone else's eyes? These are some of the painful moments you will relieve with Greg Kinney in Cabin Fever. It can be tough to find other sources of entertainment, but when the school playground equipment disappears piece by piece that's just not playing fair. But things really heat up as Greg finds himself on the wrong side of the law (it was an accident - REALLY!), and holes up in his house while a vicious winter storm batters the area and the Kinneys are left without power. Inconvenient, yes, but maybe it will buy him some time. Let's face it: Seventh grade is tough - no other way around it.  Maybe it's a rite of passage through which every human being must walk, and now we can forget our own pain as we watch Greg's accute discomfort in the newest entries of Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever.
B000002SYG|5.0|This album is a good compilation of the best songs by Culture Club. I really enjoyed their music and videos in the eighties and it's nice to relive some of those experiences. There are morte complete  albums out there but this one certainly gives you the highlights of the group.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|In the style of Jane Austin, felt like I was back in the early 19th century with all the details.  I love details and also enjoyed the mystery.<br /><br />Sally
B003YGSLDA|5.0|This story of Santa Claus and how he came to be is touching, one of the best Santa movies of all time. The amazing cast and story will keep you mesmerized.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Saw this movie years ago. Have loved it ever since! Seriously, Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki haven't done a horrible movie yet. You can't go wrong with this movie, even the visuals never get old! Looks just as good, if not better then todays animated movies.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I watched all episodes in no time at all and recommended it right away to a friend of mine.  It's so, so sweet!
0061438294|5.0|My husband is a P.I. and needed this book to aid him in his investigation when he has to interrogate people and this book help him identify the body language of people to see if they were lying or telling the truth.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This album is a must for anyone who enjoys catchy pop tunes.  Cleverly crafted, slickly produced, high energy songs that are insanely fun to turn up loud and sing along to... even when the lyrics venture over to the ridiculous side.  Perfect for a night hanging with friends, a summer road trip, or a day at the beach.<br /><br />Format note:  I've got both the CD and MP3's (thanks AutoRip!), and while the MP3's sound okay, the songs sound so much clearer and better when listened to in the better CD format.  Do yourself a favor and pick up the physical disc -- it will add another noticeable dimension to the listening experience.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this for my 6yr daughter!  She loves ' it, but I am the one who plays the game most. Love the whole concept, being in my 40's it reminds me off pitfall.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This movie is a nicely done film from Dave Grohl, whose career took off after the release of Nirvana's &#34;Nevermind&#34;, which was recorded at Sound City Studios.<br /><br />Sound City Studios -- the location where many BIG albums were recorded -- owed much of it's success to the sounds recorded by it's analog gear.  However, as digital recording studios gained in popularity, it became harder for Sound City to compete.  Fun look back at old footage and new interviews of the people and gear that made the studio the success it was.  Although the Sound City Studio is no longer in business, it's legacy lives strong, and some of the gear has a new home...<br /><br />Check out the film for the history, nostalgia, and jam sessions from some big names (Stevie Nicks, Trent Reznor, Paul McCartney, plus).
B00BESM14U|4.0|Not the greatest movie but definitely entertaining. It has a good story. Good to see at least one time. :)
1616550414|5.0|I just got it in the mail and I must say this is everything and more for any Zelda fan.<br />I remember going over to my friends house just to play a link to the past so many years age. We had played practically everyday till we beat it. (With some help from his older brother). I was immediately brought in by the story and the sense of adventure it gave more than any game at that time. It was until I played ocarina of time where I knew I was in love. Not only was it the first game I beat by myself but it had also been the game that really got me into gaming.<br />Fast forward to 2013 and at this point I've played almost every Zelda game out there and now consider my self to be a huge fan.So when I heard they were releasing the hyrule historia it was pretty much a no-brainer. Now I have collected many art/info books from my favorite games through out the years (Halo, Assassins Creed, etc) and many of them have done a good job diving into how they're made. Hyrule historian is different though, not only does it have concept art for the games but it also dives into the philosophy of them and even features an official timeline of the Zelda games. The Hyrule historia dives into 25 years of how they were able to bring the magic to each story and also the future of this wonderful series. If your're a loyal legend of Zelda fan. Do yourself a favor and get this. You really won't regret it!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Washington was awesome, as usual. This movie made me think if I ever want to fly again. Kept me interested.

B000GFLE1S|5.0|One of the best! Proves how wrong first impressions can be and how easy it can be to open your mind (and heart) to something or someone different. I watched this movie many years ago and have always meant to purchase it - now I finally have!
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This is a very fun and good game to play you should try it! Awesome is another word to describe this game!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Good book, not as good as gone girl, but entertaining none the less.  She really knows how to end a book!

B0040HO01Y|5.0|I found this a very entertaining series and went on to Season 2 right away to continue the story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like it. you have fun a lot.<br />You start very easy but you can you set goals increasingly strong
B008A8AJ4G|5.0|We might be ordinary men (and women), but we all loved this picture disc. It was exactly for what I was hoping!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It had the spooky music and stuff. it has weird controls ( in my opinion ^^)<br />but otherwise it was fun and scary :D :D
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good story about a very realistic situation.  We are surrounded by folks who are struggling wiith some type of mental illness.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|after my first personal video as it stopped replay a mysterious voice came on reading a book with no way to stop it except by shutting down the kindle;  repeated twice with the same result but not the third !!! what's going on?  can't cancel my order and delete it form my kindle, just lost .99  boohoo!  Don't know how to fix it and i have to keep writing for the system to accept my review; don't know how long you'll have to keep on reading this for the summit button becomes active.  it took nice quality pics but reverses the scene from left to right

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best series which I have ever watched! So worth watching and I cannot wait for the next series to begin!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I'm a big Kate Morton fan, but this is her best book yet!  Looking forward to her next work of genius!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|So sad that this Veteran's life ended so soon so tragically. I truly enjoyed getting to know this true patriot through his book.
0865479410|5.0|I hesitate to call any book life-changing, but this book comes close. Being an overly goal-oriented person, I really needed to read this book--In fact I'm rereading at this point. Luckily this is a pleasure, because the book is not only full of some real wisdom (in my opinion) but also well written and hilarious. I really do highly recommend it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have all of the Nicholas Sparks book and love them all. I haven't read one that I didn't enjoy
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The controls and basic game engine are great and could be used to make a great game. This is not that game.<br /><br />The gameplay is boring and pointless. It is hard to figure out what to do, because there is so little to do. Finding all 8 pages is a challenge because endless pointless searching is mind-numbing. Aside from taking pages you cannot interact with your environment, even though it seems like you should be able to (open doors, pick up a gas can, etc.).
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Awesome, beautiful movie...funny, bittersweet, heartwarming.  Two unlikely human beings connect and transform one another...my favorite kind of movie.  I loved the music too... already ordered the soundtrack.  Watch it!  :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was looking for something to fill my 'Downton' gap and at first this seemed kind of slow.  But I've now worked my way through the entire series, up to the last episode (which I'll see today sometime), and I find I'm often thinking about these characters.  They are all quite compelling, especially once you get to know them.  My one criticism is that they seem to drop characters often with no substantial explanation.  They go away for a 'short time' and never come back, i.e. Robert Timmins, Jimmy Dowland and Lord Timothy.  And then after only 6 episodes in season 4, it is no more?<br /><br />There are two characters that are so annoying it's all I can do to keep from shutting it off and walking away - the blithering, blathering brain-dead Minnie (and who can understand why intelligent Alf would tolerate her)  and the loud, overbearing, selfish, non-thinking Caroline Arliss. When she talks my brain says &#34;Make her go way!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;.<br /><br />:::sigh::: Now I'll have to find something to fill THIS gap after I see the last episode.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Great CD for easy listening.  Great relaxing music to go with any study session or just chilling.  Highly recomended 5 stars
B0073U2FB2|5.0|this is a great sifi movie that keeps you on your toes through out the whole movie awesome thank you

B009AMALGM|5.0|awesome movie it was the final one to complete my collection thank you i watch them over and over love it
B0086HGW42|4.0|The whole album is really good for background music or playing in the car. The lyrics are fun and clever, and Ed Sheeran has a beeeaaauutiful voice. But within the album, there are a few songs I can play over and over and over.  My only gripe is that &#34;Give Me Love&#34; and &#34;The Parting Gift&#34; are one track. I used an mp3 splitter to separate them, so it was an easy fix.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My high school aged kids and several of their friends read this book.  I think this is  the new &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34;.  However the subject matter is defiantly geared to a high school student. I would not recommend this book for younger readers.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A complex topic that Lewis somehow makes easy to read with Interesting characters and precise details. Enjoy this trip to the evil side of Wall Street.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game for kids and adults. Great game to kill time. Mg 3 year old nephew and 28 year old brother play this game toghther. Great family game.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was very good. Very good read for young adults who like romance books. I was looking for something steamier so that would be why I rated it 4 star.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|love it you can adjust different campartments in it to hold exactly what you want! Best of all it was FREE with my purchase!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good app, very fun. I would definately recommend this to anyone. I think it is very realistic and is totally worth downloading. Works great on kindle fire too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book. Plot was good. A bit hard to follow at the end though. It was worth reading.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very different kind of challenge. Good for the brain. Great way to spend time while listening to things on TV.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|A very unique read - intertwined layers of a story from different perspectives. Once I started the book I was barely able to put it down.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I gave a three because of the Mcikinley stamped on the front,But FiiO is a realy good product if you are truly a music lover you will love there product From the E-1 to the E-12,,all are wonderful the sound clarity is amazing.
0061978078|4.0|When we see Lena again in this book, she is a very different Lena.  The events of the first book have changed her and hardened her.  She is now a part of the Resistance and no longer uncertain about her feelings towards the government.  This book gives us a very bitter Lena, and I'm not going to lie, I kind of missed the old naive Lena.  However, it was nice to see her character grow.<br /><br />Fans of Alex are not going to be thrilled with this novel, being that he does not have a real presence.  I am one of those people, I enjoyed the book, but I desperately missed Alex.  I honestly did not realize how much I liked his character until he wasn't there.  I kept hoping he would appear, only to be disappointed.  The introduction of Julian (a new male lead) annoyed me, and in my opinion Julian was no Alex, not even close really.<br /><br />Once again, Oliver leaves you with an ending that will leave you dying for more.  I re-read the last page over and over again hoping that more pages would magically appear.  I would definitely recommend this book.  However, if you don't do well with cliffhangers, I would recommend you wait to read it until next February when Requiem (the third and final installment) is released.  I know the ending messed with my mental health, and I almost wish I would have waited to read the series when it was completed.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|Great movie. No issues with sound or recording. It has been played multiple times. Great for in the car ride!!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Overall, I thought this book was simply okay. There wasn't anything about it that really pulled me in, and a lot of the book I simply found boring. That's not to say the book didn't have its moments, but it took a while to get to these good moments.<br /><br />Like Matched, this book also dragged.  It felt like it took forever for Ky and Cassia to find each other, and then in the end they are only torn apart once again. It made the book feel very repetitive. I really just want to know why Ky and Cassia couldn't stay together. In essence, both Matched and Crossed leave the reader in the same place. Cassia and Ky defied all odds to be together, only to be ripped apart again.<br /><br />Cassia is starting to come across as very fickle. I hate The Society, but its comfortable. I love Ky, but I don't know him, do I need to know him, blah blah blah. She just needs to get over it already. It is obvious she loves Ky, so she needs to move on and get over it.<br /><br />I am with Ky in not trusting The Rising. In my opinion, they have way too many similarities to The Society. 1) The members of The Rising, can only know about what they are assigned to. 2) People are still sorted. Also, it is clear that they were the ones to wipe out the Farmers. They are no better than The Society and I do not trust them. Also, I think it was The Rising who put Ky into the matching pool, because they somehow knew that Cassia would get him to join with them.<br /><br />Also, as much as I hate to say it, I don't know if I really trust Xander, as much as I want to. There were a couple of moments where I doubted his intentions. I really hope I am wrong. However, for someone who knew a lot about the red and green pills, he should have known what the blue pills really do.<br /><br />The long distance love triangle is probably the most annoying part of the book. Cassia just fled her society, and risked her life for Ky, but she is still thinking about Xander. I mean, come on, everything Cassia has done will have been for nothing if she all of a sudden decides Xander is the one for her. Her feelings for Xander feel very forced, especially since Xander is practically nonexistent.<br /><br />One thing I did enjoy about this book, was Ky's point of view. I feel like I understand his character much better now, although I still feel that there is a lot to be learned. Ky really needs to learn how to open up. I like Ky, but he is far from one of my favorite fictional characters.<br /><br />All in all, Crossed is just alright. It is no Delirium or Divergent, but if you are a big fan of dystopians, you will probably enjoy this.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love grisham and this book is another success<br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone. I can't wait for the next book
0061726834|5.0|First off, I loved this book and the ending left me speechless.  The story was beautifully written and from the moment you read the first sentence, you know you are going to adore this book.  Lauren Oliver creates a wonderful dystopian world.  A world that would be very hard to imagine if it were not for Oliver's writing.  It is so hard to imagine a world without love, since our world is so centered around it.  It is a part of every book, song, movie, conversation, etc...  It is interesting to watch Lena fall in love, when she grew up her whole life believing it was a sickness.  The reader soon learns that the cure isn't about protecting people from love, but merely about control.<br /><br />Alex and Lena's relationship is extremely sweet.  I enjoyed reading about their relationship because there wasn't anything particularly special about either one of them.  Meaning neither one was immortal or a vampire or whatever.  They were simply two teens who fell in love for the first time.  Only problem is that love is forbidden in this world.<br /><br />I don't want to say anymore or give away the ending, because it is truly mind-blowing.  This book makes you realize just how important love is and what a world would be like without it.  I recommend this book to basically anyone.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Having worked in several IT organizations a different levels of management I can attest to the importance of the points made in this book. Although the story is a little bit &#34;over the top&#34; in some places I could not help myself from smiling all the way through as I remember being in exactly the same situations and meetings...:-)
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The movie made me laugh and cry.  It brought the realization of how someone's world can be changed by human touch and compassion.  Life is what YOU make of it to be either positive or negative.  The movie demonstrated that it is simply mind over matter and what really counts is how YOU contribute to it.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|After disappointment with Morph the Cat, Sunken Condos hooked me with its fantastic funky grooves from the first listen. And while it doesn't have the tonal and chord complexity we got with Nightfly or with so much of the superb Steely Dan material, it really does grow on you and you find different changes and little Fagenesque tricks that delight throughout, even if you're not a musician.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed a certain prescience in Fagen's themes? Like how he and Becker put out Everything Must Go as the fiscal bubble was preparing to burst and this solo recording came out just weeks before Hurricane Sandy?  Fagen knows something we don't. Or suspects something we should.<br /><br />So it's a rave. Why only four stars? I would reserve that distinction only for the masterpiece material -- stuff like Nightfly and Aja. But coming from anyone else, I'd probably try to give this six stars.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Parts of this biography dragged, but it always kept my attention and I felt it was a very impartial view of his life.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|this movie is the best movie I have seen in a while.  Action packed and thought provoking.  Awesome from start to finish.  Must watch!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Every Time I play this game I can't stop playing. I love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love this game.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The first part of the book started out great. Very atmospheric. I felt like I was back in Gatlin with my old friends. Then is got a little slow and boring. But once Ethan and Link started their quest in the tunnels, it was exciting again.<br /><br />We learn a lot more about the caster world, and meet some new creatures, like the Vex. Ethan learns that many from the mortal world are interconnected with the Caster world.<br /><br />Ridley also shows up again. I like her relationship with Link, and would like to see it develop more. Link is such a great character, always so positive.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in the second half of this book. A lot of characters show up, both old and new. The epic battle at the end seemed to resolve a little too easily for me, but this book was still fun to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A very creative and fun game that can keep anyone occupied! You can build just about anything with various types of blocks in creative mode and hostile mobs in survival mode.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Essentially one more story about the ebbs and flows of a sociopath, with the addition of a narcissist to mess with. I won't tell you who is who so as not to spoil the story. I liked some of the turns of phrases in the book. I only liked two characters: Go, Nick's sister, and the female cop.<br /><br />Basically, I'm bored with stories about sick people and how sick they are. Flynn is a good craftsman in terms of crafting this story, but I found it unbelievable most of the time. If it had been mostly about how a marriage can go wrong--a cautionary tale--I may have liked it more.
1451629192|2.0|I have read at least half of the reviews for this memoir, and I see a pattern. Those who loved it champion Jaycee's triumph of spirit and courage, which was well deserved. Those who criticized the writing got shot down by those mistaking their reviews for a criticism of the writer. Again and again, their responses to a writing critique scream SHE WAS ELEVEN.<br /><br />But Jaycee herself had the awareness and the wherewithal to say in her disclaimer that if readers want a less confusing (more coherent) work, they should come back to her in ten years when she will have sorted it all out. I believe she should have waited the ten years.<br /><br />Her therapist suggested she use writing as therapy, which for trauma survivors is very, very helpful. What she presented as memoir, I believe, was a therapeutic work that, if she had nurtured her writing skills and gotten the perspective of time, could have been turned into a truly eloquent, deep, and moving memoir.<br /><br />On her list of things she wanted to do, one was to write a best seller. Doubtless she was approached about creating a book. I find it shameful that Simon and Shuster allowed her book to be published unedited, because I believe it was a marketing ploy. I get that people defend the work as written in her own words, but editing it would have retained her own words, just eliminated the errors and made it more readable.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|it is so cool because if you see all the pictures it is like you know what is going to happen.when I was staring somewhere there was slenderman so newsflash this app will scare you but it will be cool

B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Only if you have a heart of stone will you not love and hate this film.  Steven Spielberg's most fascinating and emotional film.  I know of no one who did not have their breaths taken away by the pure horror of the madness of the SS during WW II.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It kept you guessing until the very end,  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery!
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Das Boot is the most accurate film of the true horror of fighting in submarines during WW II.  There is nothing good about the terrible lives these men suffered under to serve their country.  Sherman was so very accurate.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Great movie.  Love the Boston theme and the back drop.  The acting is outstanding and the action scenes are the best.  You really get into the action.
B007FO5PYK|5.0|Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar doing the Tango makes this a legitimate 5 State film forever.  Al Pacino makes this his tour de force and he deserved the Academy Award for his performance.
B000M341QE|5.0|I really like watching this movie so I what it a few times a year.  The DVD was like as new and it shipped right away.  The cost was low and all worthwhile.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm a single, working mom with two little girls under five. My greatest recommendation of Downton Abbey is that I make time to watch it. It's so good, I can't bear to miss it, as crazy and busy as my life gets.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I fought and fought and could not get it to work. Eprint is like built in on my Iphone or the Iphone has a built in system to connect it to the printer. The Kindle did not. So I had to get eprint and it was a fizzle to me.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|It's a strong claim I realize and people are welcome to disagree, but this is the best Sci-Fi TV show ever made (yes I have thought about Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, etc).  I am not a Sci-Fi connoisseur, but in comparison all other space based shows lack the soul, the grit, the humor, the creativity and the excellent dialogue of Firefly.  Other shows certainly had bigger budgets and to some the sterile looking bridge of the Enterprise probably holds more appeal.  I'm not one of those people.  In the short space of 14 episodes, I grew so attached to the characters that the cancellation of the show was actually painful.  I still get angry at Fox when I think about it, even when part of my brain realizes that the Fox execs probably had good business reasons to commit their heinous unforgivable disgusting horrible abhorrent detestable crime.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Fun jigsaw puzzles to do when you have nothing else to do.  Great for a trip.  These puzzles would be a nice introduction to jigsaw puzzles for kids.
B0076DELIG|1.0|About half the story is vintage Bosch but the rest is 9 Dragons type shoot-em-up and conspiracy.  Bring back the old Harry!

B00A31UXLW|5.0|Despite this being more expensive that previous Kindle editions of Connelly's books it livecd up to his normal standards.  It really kept you in suspense until the end
B0012HFH9E|4.0|If you love Alan Parsons, you probably already own this album. If you don't own it yet, do yourself a favor and press the trigger on the purchase button. I bought this album used through Amazon and was extremely pleased on the quality of the album (used). The shipment was very quick. This was another successful purchase from the Amazon marketplace.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book dragged . Sucked . For quite sometime the chaptersdragged .<br /> I hope the third book is better and . More . Interesting
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent read.  First hand account of what it takes to become a seal and remain one.  Accounts of his deployments by both himself and his wife.
B003WTE886|5.0|I really like this cd.  I would recommend buying the deluxe edition so that you can have access to all the bonus songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 year old played this on a friend's fire and had to get his own copy. He really likes it and thinks it is a great game. Watching him pkwy it is a well-done and silly \\"Temple Run\\" type game.

1608871452|5.0|I absolutely love this book :) It has lots of full colour photos of all the characters, mainly Sam and Dean, but lots of Cas, too :) It has postcard type pictures stuck in there, a map of where the boys have travelled in the Impala, comic book cover posters, stickers, so much cool stuff !! I would reccommend this to every Supernatural fan out there, this book is awesome :) :)
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The book started off slow and strange. But it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the characters. Read this series for sure!
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Wreck-It Ralph is one of those rare animated movies that hits all the right notes for kids and adults alike. You don't have to recognize all the game references in order to enjoy the film, though they are great Easter eggs for those who grew up with the classic arcade games. I liked that the main story was original and paid tribute to the classic characters without relying on them too much for support.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this movie is not the movie itself, but the quality of the physical product. When I opened the movie, I found that the blue plastic case was cracked down the middle, almost falling apart, and it doesn't close on one end because one of the plastic tabs was broken off. Because the bubble mailer AND the cardboard slipcover for the movie had no damage, I can only assume the case was broken before it was even put in the slipcover.<br /><br />But even worse than the packaging is that the DVD copy had multiple scratches on it before I even took it out of the case. They don't look deep enough to cause too much damage, but I have not yet tested it, so we'll see. It still is very disappointing to have a brand new product shipped in this condition. I have come to expect only the best from Amazon, and this is the first time I have been let down by their product. Now the question is, is it worth the 1-2 week wait to send it back and get a replacement?
0307352153|4.0|This is a well researched topic & well written. For an introvert it is very reassuring and supportive and explains many things about the USA culture that I had never really thought of before. It also explains the introvert characteristics and behaviors in many different environments. I have never seen a book like this before - I heard it reviewed on NPR and highly recommend it.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I love the fact that you only need the base. You can take it with you and it can use bluetooth. It is also made very sturdy unlike the $300 Summer one that feels like a cheap toy.  Can't say enough good things about this,
B001NS7J02|5.0|Bought this knowing I had heard some Type O Negative in the past, but never owned an album.  The album just takes off from track 1 and kept me rocking through each track.  My favorite track has got to be Blood + Fire.  I played the album for the first time and i never skipped a track... Buy this if you want some great rock music to keep you moving..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am 50 years old and really enjoyed these books. Yes the books were written for a younger audience. That just made them read a little faster than other books. You have to read all 3 books to understand the overall story. I can see why they turned into blockbuster movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book. Couldn't put it down now I'm on to the second one and having a hard time putting it down too.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|very easy process and the songs are pretty nice, maroon 5 really outdid themselves this time even though they do record good albums all the time
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is what has happened and what has never happened to me in high school. This novel is honest, relatable, and encouraging; I feel so animated when I read, and can only hope everyone else who reads will too. A fantastic work of art worth every minute, every time, even with the movie. It just makes me feel so \\"Infinite\\"
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King is the master of story telling.  This book was easy to read. Don't let the size of the book fool you, you will be finished before you know it.
B007G3H8Y0|2.0|While it wasn't really bad, after other &#34;Train&#34; albums I've had this one was a bit of a downer to me. However I ordered Maroon5's &#34;overexposed&#34; at the same time and after listening to that upbeat album, pretty much anything would be a downer. I really didn't find a special connection to any of the songs on this album as I have to many of their songs in the past, and none of them seemed to have much spunk to them.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just the right amount of weird and creepy.. I Love it! I think you will too! Watch and find out!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I love Graceland music and love Paul Simon - I had this CD before but lost it (or someone took it)??? - so I replaced it. Thank you
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I look forward to each episode and enjoy the quick and witty interactions between the actors.  The plot and writing are a welcome relief from brain dead sitcoms and reality TV, at least for me.
B000AYQJ3I|4.0|This was a present for my husband who is a fan of the Beatles - he loves it and have watched it with him many, many times and every time we enjoy it.  Thanks!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Another great Kate Morton book.  Great historical fiction.  I missed the characters when it was over.  I can't wait to read another.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy the game. However, before every new game there is an advertisement and they are sometimes advertising singles websites. Not appropriate for the children. Too distracting!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Stinker. Over stylized. Badly acted. Horrible fake version of waltzing. All in all, a waste of tens of millions of dollars. Save yourself from wasting any more and don't rent it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|There interaction of characters - the twists and turns of the plot and the crushing reality of a feudal world are all here.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|loved it so much i'm going to acquire another for my son in colledge. my m50 headphone sound great, but they are awsome with the fiio 17 amp...
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I didn't think I could keep track of the various overlapping stories of 25 different &#34;main characters&#34;, but I've started to feel like one of them myself. It's a soap opera without the cheese and bad acting.

1400062756|4.0|I say intro book because, although Dr. Dweck has much experience in this field researching and teaching, she wrote this book for a seventh grader to understand. Great material though. Definitely one of those books to give as a gift to a friend you want to be more successful at work.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Free. May not be super-challenging but will kill some time in the waiting room, or in line for a film, etc.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read in a while. Nerve wracking suspense, coupled with laugh out loud humor, the Martian delivers... in spades. Kudos to an outstanding author for bringing the space program and the men and women who help run it to the fore front of new literary fiction.
B0032Y0OH0|3.0|Reviews were positive and it wasn't very expensive; but the included (or available on Contour website) software profiles for a lot of things are waaay out of date. Sound Forge 8?? Really? Acid Pro 4??  If you don't mind spending hours matching the Shuttle profile to your software s keyboard shortcuts (and even then they sometimes inexplicably don't work), knock yourself out. Maybe the more expensive Pro model gets all the support. My unit, which arrived on 3/5/13, was apparently made in 2009. Feeling a bit deceived, but was able to get it configured for Acid Pro 7 in about 30 minutes of fooling around. I think I might return it and try the Pro.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love that the ABR is ad-free. I have problems with the version that had adds on my phone. The adds would pop up when I'm trying to launch and automatically take me to the webpage of whatever was being advertized. It may not be HD, but I'm an Angry Birds addict
0865478007|5.0|I knew from reading: Bitter Pills: Inside the Hazardous World of Legal Drugs by Stephen Fried, that this was the norm in the Medical/Pharmaceutical Industrial complex but I had no idea how insidious it actually is.  Also I am reading:<br />The vaccination policy and the Code of Practice of the Joint Committee on<br />Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI): are they at odds? Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD<br />Neural Dynamics Research Group, Dept. of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British<br />Columbia, 828 W. 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L8,<br />in addition to other studies over the last 7 years I've been seriously researching drugs and vaccines, I am at a loss for words to describe how the American people have become so complacent and lazy when it comes to the health and well being of a loved one.  Because medical people come from a misguided position of power, people don't question and challenge the ridiculous things Dr's tell them.  The revolving door of Big Pharm, The CDC, The FDA and government officials is the most incestuous relationship that exists.  If this book outrages you, read the transcripts from the Simpsonwood conference held in Norcross, Georgia on June 7-8, 2000.  It's another &#34;secret&#34;meeting resulting in SECRETS being kept from the American people and people around that word that has profoundly impacted the health and well being of humanity.  The information is overwhelming that the world has been manipulated from birth to death, from vaccines given to pregnant women (Dtap, flu vaccines-hep B vaccines given to newborns less han 12 hours old to chemo therapy & radiation given to a cancer patients hours before they die.  It's about money, power & control.  It's time to wake up people.  America ranks 37th in Health Care in the word and continues to go down and infant mortality ranks anywhere from 37th to 49th in the world depending on the source.  Read this book and you'll know why.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The song selections and presentation are wonderful.  Every one an enjoyable experience, well organized and beautifully done.<br /><br />We've heard the songd before, but not like this!  Excellent.
B008EZVNO0|2.0|Unfortunately, Van Morrison's new CD is a snooze fest.  It sounds like Van had a party and played some music to relax.  The opener \\"Open the Door\\" is only average with familiar bass lines, familiar riffs and nothing much exciting.  I like Morrison's beat on \\"Goin' Down Monte Carlo,\\" but it doesn't go anywhere, just the same stuff over and over for eight minutes.  \\"Born to Sing\\" sounds lifeless, routine, perfunctory.  Unfortunately, the CD doesn't much improve with \\"Close Enough for Jazz\\" sounding like elevator music and \\"Mystic of the East\\" like a sonic tranquilizer.  \\"Retreat & Review\\" & \\"In Money We Trust\\" likewise fail to find any sparks.  \\"Pagan Heart\\" heart may be the least interesting Morrison ever.  \\"Educating Archie\\" has a pedantic diatribe for the lyric juxtaposed to a repetitive sonic snore.  Morrison's voice, as always, is fascinating, which still ranks him as one of the all-time classic pop singers.  On \\"Born to Sing\\" he is boring.  Taxi!
1451695195|5.0|Pure joy! Gratitude that Dr. Alexander had this great gift but also the ability to effectively narrate the wonders and the powerful effects on his own mentality and attitude.<br />It was a thrill to read the first time, but most rewarding to read and comprehend more the second time. It is a great gift that I have sent to each of my children. Yes, they also have knowledge of someone who has had NDE. This i the greatest find of all.<br />Every mortal should have the privilege of reading this. Then read again for the third time page 71. We do hear so often about love. This puts it front and center.The pages 159,160, &161 really helps to create a wondrous excitement.<br />Can you imagine, all knowledge and  wonders? He did not see the face of God. That will be overwhelming!!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|John Rebus may have retired from the CID but I am thrilled that he did not retire from us.  This is another in a long series of excellent and fulfilling stories about a tremendously dour but greatly effective and strangely appealing ex- DI.  Others have touched the high points of the book.  Suffice it to say that at the end I was ever so happy to know that Rebus lives to give another tale.  His racing heart unnerved me and is probably a harbinger but I refuse to dwell on it.
0525952926|5.0|I couldn't put the first book down, and this keeps the story going just fine. It is more about the 2nd generation though, the kids of Book One's main characters, but Follett is such as great writer, that your interest never wanes. Can't wait for Book Three!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|A light-hearted (mostly), fun romp through monster movie memes and films.<br /><br />The characterization of Dracula doesn't fit with more traditional depictions (this version is basically just an overly-protective father figure, albeit with the powers of a vampire giving him somewhat more threat to back him up).<br /><br />However, while Sandler gives an effective performance, it's the other characters in the movie that really give this movie its heart; Dracula is just a bit too over-the-top to be taken too seriously.<br /><br />A fun watch, though.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I've noticed while playing this game it is sort of like the Mario bros game, witch is pretty cool stuff!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Growing up in England, I'm familiar with the original version of the character from the comic book (2000 A.D., I think it was called, but it's been a while). This version is far more faithful to that version than Stallone's effort (not that I thought that version was bad, but this one is better).<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind about this is that the original comic is a satire of American culture, taken to its extreme and from the point of view of those of us in ol' Blighty, and this movie reflects that well. Just remember that satire does not mean parody--a parodic film would be played more for comic effect; this one is handled with deadly earnestness.<br /><br />Decent action set pieces; somewhat over the top, but that does reflect the original material, at least what I remember of it.<br /><br />Dredd is suitably ruthless, but still possesses more compassion and humanity, in his way, than some of his fellow Judges, despite his rigid adherence to &#34;the Law.&#34;
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Anybody who likes books with plot twists you never see coming will really enjoy this book. I started to get an inkling about who the killer might be, but then I was thrown for a loop. This book is really engaging, and worth the money. Gillian Flynn's first novel got me hooked! The only thing I can complain about is that there are only two more Gillian Flynn novels, all of which I had devoured within a few days of reading Sharp Objects. The characters are REAL, and there were never moments where I was thinking &#34;that would never happen&#34;. Never.
B00BLGZDYA|4.0|This is a weird one; not really for someone who isn't prepared to think, and has some extreme moments so should not be considered family-friendly. I do not suggest watching this if you are easily offended, as there is one scene with gratuitous nudity--albeit blurred out in the edition I watched--and some over-the-top, almost comically so--violence (not much, but it is there).<br /><br />Not a particularly complex film, but very dense with symbolism and film imagery and memes; this is a film that will probably leave you scratching your head and thinking &#34;What did I just watch?&#34; However, the lack of complexity is subjective; this film will be as complex or as simple as you decide it is, since it's interpretation is very much up to the observer.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that the key to &#34;understanding&#34; it (if this is even necessary) is to realize who the person at the beginning of the film is; with that understanding, suddenly the whole film takes on a whole new meaning and became (for me, anyway) clearly understandable.<br /><br />Your experience will almost certainly vary. Have fun with it! I did.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I am an avid reader. I devour books like my kids devour candy, and this book was no exception. Most books I read leave the characters a little flat. There are so many unrealistic qualities about them that it can sometimes be difficult to even care what happens next. But Gillian Flynn is truly a master at creating characters that are real people. We accept them whether we like them or not because they are so utterly human. Lily Day, for example, is not a very likable character--at least not at first. She is lazy, she is bitter, she is a drunk, and she isn't somebody I would ever have imagined caring about. Except I did.<br />The portrait of Lily's mother and family rings so true that I found I just had to know what happened to them next. All of them! More twists and turns than I can fathom in this book made it compelling, and this book was another one I devoured in less than a day. Keep 'em coming, Ms. Flynn!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|An entertaining film; not without it's faults but, as you might guess, I feel it's strengths outweigh what faults it has.<br /><br />The plot is a bit obvious at times--quite predictable, especially for an adult--but this doesn't stop it from being an entertaining romp through the world of video games. Somewhat of a modern, less grim take on Tron (that said, don't watch this expecting it to be Tron--it has more in common with Reboot).<br /><br />If you're not a fan of video games, this is simply an above-average story about a guy who tries to show he can be more than he is believed to be. Not great, but far from the worst Disney has produced.<br /><br />Has some strong moments and well worth watching at least, if not owning.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I didn't love this book, but I did find myself engaged with the characters and wondering what was going to happen. It seemed very unrealistic in places, but I still found myself wanting to know what happens to Sky, and why the boy she loves is so utterly Hopeless.
B00A12VJZM|4.0|I wish there were more new songs, or some remixs on it, would be great for someone just discovering the Rolling Stones, but older listeners not so much.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Every time I read or see the series I am so much more thankful and appreciative to this incredible Generation of young men.  I have heard it said that every generation going back is tougher than the one that follows it.  Today we have an incredible generation of selfish, self-entitled, lazy louts (especially my nephews)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Superb acting, excellent cinematography; plot lines complex and sometimes a little too overblown (but excellent for the most part).  Almost up to the standard of Foyle's War.  I have the same comments about Season 3.  I was unable to view Season 1.
