B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever!!!!! I think out of the whole thing this is the best one and I hate reading I can't wait for the movie!!!
B00797MB0O|5.0|I don't understand people who did not like this movie.  I just loved the sarcasm and black humor of this movie.  It's subtle and different.  This is not a mediocre hollywood comedy.  Charlize Theron was great for this movie too. This is good!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed the 5 ft cord. It makes it easy to plug my kindle in to charge each day  After reading most of day.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is hilarious! LOVE the soundtrack; it is becoming more like a sing-along when I watch it now. Great for movie nights with a group.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a well written, suspenseful novel.  I really enjoyed the character development and the plot twists.  I would highly recommend it.
0679809015|5.0|This book has durable flaps and has a lot more pages than I anticipated for its size (10 hidden animals).  My 14 month old enjoys opening the flaps which makes it quite an interactive little book. I plan to purchase this book for my friends' kids as well.
B00908DDZM|5.0|My daughter and Loved the CD.  This was the best CD always listening to it in the care with our windows out!
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|It's very rare when a reunion album deserves immediate attention but this one takes it. Great songwriting, musicianship, and authenticity to Suedes original sound.  It's a keeper.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game but after a while of playing my game just turns blue and I can`t play anymore I have to turn my kindle off and on before I can play again
B006362ZR6|5.0|I love this CD! I've been a fan of The Fray since they first came out and this cd completes my collection. The Fray is one group that when I listen to their CDs I love every song on them right away! Scars & Stories is a must purchase!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really struggled with the first two books. They were very hard for me to get into, just because they were so confusing. I felt like if I understood everything that was happening along with all of the terminology being used, then I would be enjoying it. I could tell it was interesting, but I honestly wanted to quit out of pure frustration. Thankfully, this book had been recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I trust implicitly, so I decided to keep going. And whoa! Was I in for a treat! By the middle of the third and definitely by the end, I could NOT put this book down! I was so desperate to find out what happened with every character and to figure out all the mysteries within the story.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the fifth book I understood the significance and importance of the first two books. They laid a very solid foundation that set the rest of the story beautifully in motion. And  one plus, I don't feel like anything was left unanswered.  I have a new favorite author. Thank you Mr. Howey for such a great story!
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was a complex mystery with great characters and many twists and turns.  In my life I've known a few men like Puller, so the book kept my attention.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I like the product.<br />It's what I wanted.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone shopping the market for this type of item.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is the same funk and disco as Discovery, but with 70's collaborators that make it more funk than imagined. The vocorder sounds more human, the beat is still the same, and its Daft Punk. I reccommend this to anyone. Guys, girls whoever. When this album came out i performed at my apartment pool and everybody came out to hear it and it was a total disco jam.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I like the product.<br />It's what I wanted.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone shopping the market for this type of item.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has provided me some incredible insight into how people communicate their love and need love communicated back to them.  Very insightful and particularly for marriages where the parties are frustrated and think that one does not love the other one.  As it may turn out, they just may have different &#34;languages&#34; for displaying their love.  I highly recommend that both parties in a relationship read this book!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I like the product.<br />It's what I wanted.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone shopping the market for this type of item.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i LOVE THE CHALLENGE TO KEEP GOING TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.<br /><br />I love playing this game because its so challenging.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A great story, very well written. Although I did catch the plot from the beginning. Spoiler Alert: as soon as they brought up Valentine being married to Clary' s mom and as soon as Hodge stated, that Valentine was willing to sacrifice his son.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is like super cool and it makes you think but it is way to short it needs to have like 40 levels or something and on the last level it is like super ultra long and it is really hard it is fun though you should get it if you like solving puzzles and brain teasers
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|I saw trombone shorty in a new orleans jazz festival video and had to purchase the disk. I have played brass for over 30 years and thought i was pretty good, but this guy is a prodigy. His voice is excellent also. The disk does have some filler material but it is still worth the money.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|I fell in love with this series and thought that my mom would too; I was correct! Excellent sci-fi adventure!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's an interesting game.  Took me a bit to figure it out at first, but once I did it's a fun application.  I hope you enjoy it too. Take care.
B007NESBK2|5.0|A visual and auditive masterpiece. This DVD is a must for all Sade fans, as well as,all those who enjoy good music.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have a lot of favorite games this one hit top 5 for me with the mystery and suspense I just couldn't  get enough can't wait for the next one I would even bye it for $3 :-)
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Really good movie if you like a film to grip you emotionally.  Pulls you in.  Good directing, good acting, good story.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this version, I like the shuffle option even though it sometimes feels like cheating! I haven't had any issues with mine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You will become addicted. It has become a source of competition that everyone can participate in.<br />I also like the different locations.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Graphics are great, very enticing. Puzzles draw you into the game, each level solved drags you in further. You kind of know the end is coming/ and wish you could have more time to explore.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great read. I was intrigued by this book. Kept me coming back even when I had to put it down.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I found the story to be slow, annoying and sad.<br />I could not figure out where it was going and I gave up.
B008133MDK|5.0|This series has brilliant writing and superb acting by all!  Be prepared to sit and watch them all in one sitting!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is the best show I've seen in years, such great character development and this series is just perfect.<br />The storyline is fascinating and the sense of menace and suspense is so compelling.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone.  My grandchildren will be encouraged to read it.  I hope they do!  They'll be receiving it for a Christmas present.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I uses ColorNote all the time. you can create text or make a check list. furthermore you are able the place :<br />- reminders on each note and change the color of the sticky note<br />-change the theme to white or black<br />-you no limitation to how many note you want to make<br />-you can create a backup using your email address (google account) or the sd card<br />-also you have a master password for each note you make<br /><br />get this application its worth it..<br />-
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Dropped in late 1982 nobody would have expected the boy wonder from the Jackson 5 to blow up and become the most famous man in the world i sure didn't this album won 8 grammys in 1984 and MJ had the whole world in a daze, fans from all ages and races waiting to see this man perform, so when he did perform it was one to remember which he did most famously at Motown 25 in 1983 to introduce is trademark move called The \\"Moonwalk\\" from there he soared higher than any black artist before him his videos where always shown on BET, MTV, VH1 etc... You name it he was on there, 7 singles were released with \\"Billie Jean\\" being the most famous and signature song of his career \\"Beat It\\" changed music forever \\"Thriller\\" a 13 minute short film was released and the rest is history \\"Human Nature\\" always a fan favorite and always played on radio \\"P.Y.T.\\" another top 10 hit for mr. Jackson \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\" 6 min of pure funk should have made a video for this song \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" i never liked this song shouldn't have made the album imo those where the 7 singles released out of 9 songs \\"Baby Be Mine\\" track #2 from the album i like this song alot \\"The Lady In My Life\\" closes the album well and has been sampled many times you'll know why when you listen MJ tears this song up. Thriller remains the biggest selling album of all time for good reason and will remain so until the end of time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Yes, this book is not a great literary achievement-it's really not that well-written. But all the same, once I got into it I couldn't stop. Of course, that might just be my lady parts saying that-they certainly enjoyed this book more than my mind did. :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is a fun game. I think is way better then the first.so I give this game five stars.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this as a wedding gift for my wife! She used it to download the wedding pics from camera to iPad. It worked very well. She loves it!
B00005JOA0|4.0|The talented Tara Fitzgerald spends so much of this series being a complete cow to everyone but her milquetoast young son that it is hard to believe why anyone bothers with her. Especially Toby Stephens  -  never more handsome and sexy in his role as the north country neighbour (except when at certain angles he looks too like his mother Dame Maggie Smith. His father was actor Robert Stephens.). Rupert Graves seems to be enjoying himself as Tara's dastardly first husband. It's a reasonable adaptation with pretty scenery and three attractive leads. Good for a rainy day when there's nothing better to do.
B0000BWTK3|5.0|This pair of performances, well recorded in 2002, are of a musical distinction sufficient to raise this disc to the level of other fine performances now available. The performances themselves fall into the thoughtfully sensitive type of interpretation as opposed to the more 'heart on sleeve' or more overtly dramatic style. All of these views are equally valid and choice will be a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />The Schumann concerto was recorded 'live' but there is no suggestion of an audience - not even with concluding applause. The Grieg was recorded in a studio a little while later and both recordings sound as if they had been recorded in the same conditions as each other.<br /><br />In terms of older alternatives with the same very popular coupling, Kovacevich delivers one of the most dramatic performances of both concertos. Fleisher delivers one of the freshest pairings. These three pianists between them show the variety of interpretations that can give equal satisfaction. There are numerous other fine individual pianists to consider giving performances of distinction amongst whom one would have to mention Richter, Argerich and Brendel in the Schumann and Curzon in the Grieg. These represent just the tip on the musical iceberg.<br /><br />For collectors interested in a recent pairing of these two works, this new disc certainly deserves to be considered seriously as one of the best in a very crowded field.
B00005UWUE|5.0|Roman Polanski has produced a dazzling, terrifying, blood-spilling film version of Shakespeare's darkest play about evil inhabiting the title character and his equally ambitious wife. The dark, foreboding tone commences chillingly with three hags declaring the prophecy of Macbeth's rise to power. Bleak landscapes, cold, wet weather, the discomfort and crudity of medieval living -  even for the mighty  -  lends a constant simmering unease throughout the violent and ruthless proceedings. Jon Finch as Macbeth is fine as is Francesca Annis as Lady Macbeth  -  the famous &#34;mad&#34; scene performed in the nude. The supporting cast is good as is the soundtrack, production design, hair and costumes. The film is brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski.
0425252868|5.0|This was a great read, and a riviting report of the WW-II experiences of two survivors.  For we Americans, the perspectives on the deteriorating situation in Germany and the reactions of the German pilots to the stupidity of Hitler and Goehring was most revealing and interesting.  It also was extremely intersting to learn about the anger of the German people to their own fighter pilots who had been blamed by Goehring for the destruction of Germany by the Allies.  I also had not known that the German aircraft engineers had designed and flew the very firtst opeational jet planes toward the end of the war.  It was a report of German ingenuity and creativity that was news to me.<br /><br />This is a really great book to gain some perspective on what many pilots experienced during the terrible days of the war!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  Lots of things happening all at once -- very engaging and great performances. Aside from the story, it's fun to see if you can figure out which character is portrayed by which actor in each time period.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|The inferno is everything I wanted in a gaming mouse. DPI control  is right on the money with solid performance. The laser tracking is flawless and it moves across the mouse pad so easy with the wide slick feet on the bottom of the mouse.<br />I love the mouse and it's from cooler master so you know it's well built. All I need now is more time off from work to play my games.<br />For the money the mouse is a good choice for gaming and the control of the mouse in the software is super. The software dose take some getting use to but overall the mouse has worked out very good for me.<br /> I have paid a lot more money and got a lot less mouse.. Over the years of building my own gaming systems I have found cooler master to have great products that do last well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is way better than what the description made it sound. Who knew leading a bubble through a maze ccould be so much fun.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|At the time it was the best price for the set came in all wrapped new no problems at all.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I love this movie. If you get any joy from a garden you must see it. There is much beauty in the homes and the outdor scenes. The story is very touching.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great game, easy interface, cool graphics, and a story line to boot! Only limiting item is there are no bonuses for logging in each day.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|You either love him or hate him!  And I love love love this series. So glad I got The Complete Series which includes movies. I'm going to have hours and hours of complete enjoyment and entertainment. This was a good buy. If you like Columbo, order this today!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love all 3 of them. Wish there was more!Let me know if she writes anymore of them! Thank you, Shirley
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have never before needed a personal account email, it used to all just make its way to my main inbox. Now, I can differentiate and categorize things on multiple accounts with one app.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A very good action adventure, comparable to Tom Clancy novels and movies with Jack Ryan characters. I definetly recomend it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Real time updating, very user friendly, and streamlined to make the processing of payment as efficient as the site itself. The only problem I found was my dwindling bank account!
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Not gripping like some of his other books but a very entertaining read nevertheless - it made me chuckle quite often - I don't know if all the characters were really believable but I enjoyed the storyline and the factthat at the end &#34;good&#34; triumphed
B00CXN2JNS|3.0|I have been a Megadeth follower since 1989 and I love their style. I consider Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction in my top 5 heavy metal albums as far as having a serious number of songs on each album in my Megadeth Playlist. I love songs that make me want to pick up my guitar and learn the riff and jam to it. Some of their past albums have had some great singles on it with many albums having multiple memorable songs. However this album left me feeling flat. After listening to it I honestly could not recall more than one or two &#34;jingles&#34; and none of them made me want to pick up my guitar (other than to play Tornado of Souls to cleanse my metal palette).<br /><br />It is not a bad album, it just isn't memorable.  Maybe after a few dozen listens that will change.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As usual, we're a little slow to the party-- but are hooked on this show.  We both think it's like watching a favorite book.  I especially like the depth of the characters, they are complex and change over time, like real people do instead of most movie or novel characters.  We'll be sad when it comes to an end.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super fun and addicting.  A must play.  If you like building things and are detail oriented this is a perfect game.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I had trouble with the language, as the brogue seems exaggerated. The story line is very entertaining. I began to wonder if Irish people really talk like that.  As tedious as the story was, I enjoyed it.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I purchased this for my wife. Today I'm a hero. You can see & hear these guys on YouTube if you haven't heard their music before. Classical instruments used to play non classical music.
B007P06DOK|5.0|It was given as a gift and the recepient was extremely pleased.  I could not find it in the stores.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|First book in series was much better.  This one is interesting but not as unexpected as this first one was.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a handy little app. My favorite feature is the temperature gauge, which lets me know if I should rest my kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft 7.1 it has buckets and chicken eggs and cake and fire . the duplication glich still works
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|Last weekend, I went with the family to go see After Earth. For the first time in a long time, I didn't read the critic reviews on the movie before I went to see it.<br /><br />And I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />From watching the trailers alone, I expected to get nothing less than a good action/sci-fi/thriller movie. To my delight, that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />There was a heartfelt message in this movie that was difficult to miss. I cried, smiled and giggled at some parts. I had the perfect movie-going experience. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Okay, I'll do my best to write this review without giving away too much of the movie.<br /><br />The thing I liked most about this film was the development of the father and son relationship. In the beginning, there was an obvious disconnect between Cypher--the father, and his family, more so with his son, Katai. Throughout the movie, flashes of the tragic backstory explained his emotionless demeanor and disconnect. He wanted to reconnect with his family again, and to do that he had to start with Katai. So he took Katai on an excursion, which turned out to be disastrous.<br /><br />They crashed landed on earth. Now keep in mind, this is 1000 years later. The air was different. There were no buildings and roads, or subways and such. Nature had completely taken over, and animals, who were inferior to humans, ruled the planet. Some had even grown to massive sizes.<br /><br />After gaining consciousness, Katai found his father alive, but fatally injured. That wasn't the just of their dilemma though. The beacon to contact their home station had been damaged, and the other beacon was on the tail of the ship, which was torn off during the fall, and was more than a few miles away from them. On top of that, an alien creature known to torment and kill humans, crash landed with them. This creature feeds off fear. In addition to fighting and fleeing from all the other threats on earth, Katai had to cast aside his fears and battle this creature.<br /><br />It gave a new meaning to the term, `Man up!'<br /><br />I was literally on the edge of my seat during many parts of this movie. There were some powerful and scary scenes that pulled all kinds of emotions out of me. I walked out of the theater glad I saw the movie. And YES, I will be purchasing it when it releases in bluray. I have to add it to my sci-fi collection.<br /><br />When I got home, I looked up the critic reviews and was shocked at what I found. The critics totally ripped the movie apart. I couldn't help but think to myself, they couldn't have seen the same movie I saw.<br /><br />I had the same experience with John Carter. The critics panned that movie and I absolutely loved it. I only wished I would've seen it in the theater. After I saw it and enjoyed it, I decided not to listen to the critics anymore.<br /><br />Look, I understand the movie world is pissed at M. Night Shyamalan for what he did to The Last Airbender. I agree wholeheartedly that that flick was an epic fail, and I too was highly displeased because I'm a huge Avatar, the Last Airbender fan. But come on, let's not stay mad at the man. After Earth was a great comeback. It was a fabulous storyline and it played out very well. In addition to that, Will Smith and his son, Jaden were a dynamic duo.<br /><br />Instead of listening to the critics, I suggest you go see the movie yourself and make your own judgment.ears and battle this creature.<br /><br />It gave a new meaning to the term, `Man up!'<br /><br />I was literally on the edge of my seat during many parts of this movie.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling delves into her characters in The Casual Vacancy with the same eager curiosity I found in the Potter books.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Ang Lee has done it again. Great visually appealing movie. Especially vibrant in Blu Ray. An all around thought provoking movie.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|i've bought other lightning connectors, including apples, which do not hold up to the abuse my 9 year old puts them through.  this one holds up the best, and charges my iPhone5 the quickest
B008Y73940|5.0|Good acting and good storyline. A nice group of characters.  A puzzle to figure out how he gets out of his predicament.
B000056JYC|5.0|For anyone who did not hear Humble pie or George Harrison's All Things Must Pass Peter Frampton must have been a big surprise in the spring of 1976. Regardless of wether you had heard of him this recording made sure that everybody knew Mr Frampton. I remember that on the week he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone he played an afternoon concert at American University's outdoor ampitheatre. They did not anticipate a large crowd. Now twenty five years later he is reviving his &#34;Monster&#34; hit recording with some extras thrown into the mix. I was able to see the concert and can tell you he is even better now! For those who did not catch the show the first time this will be an opportunity to hear one of &#34;rock&#34; music's more gifted guitarists. It is a fine recording and fun to listen to.
0525478817|4.0|The book was somewhat depressing overall and  perhaps I am old  fashioned but why does a book with a target audience of 14 condone sex? Reading about teens talking & thinking about sex is ok, but doing it? I preferred the movie, which portrayed the teens as beyond high school.<br />In spite of my better judgement, I gave a copy to my granddaughter, who loved it, as did her siblings. She asked me to send her all of  the author's books, which I did.<br />Obviously, In spite of a career in secondary education, I am out of touch  with adolescent literature!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|When I bought her first collection of songs I ust admit it was after I saw her music video . However, then after listening I quickly forgot the video and focused on the songs. She gets her melodies and lyirics into your mind and they do not leave. She creates great images and story lines. This recording comes a few years after her last effort and she does not miss a beat. While they are obviously her songs she is not repetative and brings you up to date with her current thoughs and feelings. A movie soundtrack for the mind where you create the visuals from her script and soundtrack.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book! It brought you into a world of fantasy with a bit of intrigue. From the first page, I was hooked.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh is a fine guitarist. Not only that but he creates snappy guitar riffs. Why I would say that he put the spark into the Eagles when he joined that band. His latest independent recording just proves the point. His songs are relavent and poignant. However, he is joe Walsh and does have fun with his lyrics at the same time. After all this is the guy who wrote Lifes Been Good To Me. I recomend this recording to everyone especially to the guitar player near you!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is even better than I remembered from fifty years ago! Children really should be encouraged to read the books that got their grandparents hooked on books!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Much nicer than I thought it would be for the price. It was on, sale by the way, and only in black. The swivel feature is a little stiff and hard to turn at first, but gets easier as you use it. It does a good job of protecting your Kindle.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Gorgeous graphics . Fun and exciting game. I never got bored with this mystery and found it easy to navigate through the different areas. Would highly recommend this game.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I loved this movie.  It will make you laugh.  It will make you cry.  It is based on real people.  It is one of the best French movies I have seen.  If you like foreign films,  see this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It was great, left me on the edge of my seat... just the ending sucks. I hope a second room comes out soon!
1847879071|5.0|This was a book that was assigned for 2 stats courses. I found myself reading ahead just for the sheer enjoyment! Hilarious examples of studies that used the various tests. Great step by step directions for SPSS with pictures to guide plus how to write it up when you're done.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|As advertised, a great retrospective!  The story line is interesting and the concert footage shows the band at it's peak
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this app is the best with all the cool graphics and how the animals and dinasuars keep on moving. so this app is the best.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made about true happenings in real life.  I have a bipolar son and could relate to the movie so so well.  I loved it and will watch it over and over again
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished \\"Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 _ 5 )<br />What a terrific series. I hated when it ended. I Need more Silo stories.<br />Are there anymore of these stories and  is there more about these characters or just new ones?<br />I can't wait to read more.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I loved the way the outcome/ending was so unexpected.  I have recommended to all my friends to watch.  Great movie
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I really like that I get to choose how I want each princess to look. I also can create little personalities and lives behind them. I just don't really like how they limit you and pretty much force you to buy the full thing. But other than that, I absolutely love this game and recommend it to all who live giving makeovers!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A sweeping, time sucking, life consuming epic saga. While that description may sound over the top and even slightly mocking, it doesn't even come close to City of Bones. I finally bucked down and bought the first of this series when I learned about the upcoming film adaptation. And ever since Lord of the Rings I've made a point to read the books before watching the movies. I'm so very glad I did so with City of Bones. It's the kind of story that makes you feel like you've fallen down the rabbit hole, or some kind of parallel universe where monsters, fairies and nightmares walk among us.<br />Clary is a perfectly average, normal teen with the usual mother issues and a secret thrill for the unknown and dangerous. Her best friend Simon isn't simply some wimpy sidekick, but a fully fleshed surprise. Can't even begin to describe his transformation. Both of them are thrown into the world of the supernatural when they meet Jace, Isabelle and Alec, three Shadowhunters.<br />Jace is simply delicious and complex. I love how Clary peels aside his layers bit by bit. And the build up till the end of the novel leaves your heart in twisted shatters, until you're a victim of classic teen angst.<br />I have to say that this book far surpasses any other YA epic that I've read so far. Because of Clare's willingness to boldly go where few YA authors have gone before, and offering us not just a rich tapestry of words but fully fleshed out characters. Buy, borrow or read this book as quickly as you can because I guarantee you won't be disappointed. For anyone who craves the \\"sight\\" I recommend this book. But beware, readers, once you've entered the rabbit hole, you might not be able to come up anytime soon.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|app works better than what it says i love this app i highly recommend this app for adults and children who need to get up for school or go to work.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Mortal Instruments is the sort of series that not just sucks you in, but makes you feel as if you've swirled down a whirlpool. If you try to swim your way out you just get dragged down deeper into the world of Shadowhunters, Warlocks and demonic forces in their battle between light and darkness. Lines are blurred and drawn between our heroes. Possibly one of my favorite new additions to this part were the Seelie Court and the lycanthrope, Maia, who may or may not be interested in Simon. As for Simon, Clary's best \\"mundane\\" friend, his life is altered to a degree you might suspect but wouldn't believe. We learn more of Valentine's plans to conquer the world for mankind. Like any great supervillian, he's convincing enough that even the reader starts to question the goodness of the Clave he's determined to tear down.<br />The High Inquisitor, meantime has arrived to find out where the loyalties of the New York Conclave lie, and Jace is used as a tool or revenge and retribution. Clare does an amazing job of interveaving character view points and motivations so you aren't sure who to root for, or exactly where their loyalties lie.<br />At the heart of the novel is the forbidden love between Jace and Clary. I have my suspicions that the \\"children\\" of Valentine may not be quite as he declares them to be. And it's heartbreaking as well as rendering to watch them fight the feelings they have for one another. In almost any other circumstance you know you should be revolted by the idea of them together, but Clare once again, burrows you so deeply in her characters that you feel as helpless and anxious to see them come together.<br />Anticipating to see what City of Glass brings to light.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Obviously music is a specific taste to everyone but this is one of the best new albums I have heard in years.  Not a bad track on it.  Cannot wait for their next effort.  Leaves you wanting more.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|I like the typical Steven S. style and the actors were good, but the ending left me flat.  I guess I was expecting more from such a sinister plot and America's scary submission and control from the pharmaceutical companies that rule us.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A well-crafted fiction about an individual's capacity to turn self-righteous indignation into a clever scheme of revenge and deadly retaliation.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|One of the best books out there.once you start you have to finish.Really enjoyed reading it. Can't wait for the next one.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|Original album remains a fantastic slab of modern day Brit pop glam, but the remastering sounds way better than the tinny original mix, it is much fuller, the bass is actually audible. Second disk is an orgy of wonderful b sides, half of which rival the quality of the tracks from the original album. Great package design, too, although the spine buckled a bit after a few months.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor i would recommend to anyone wanting to upgrade there AMD system.  It is blazing fast and brought my Asus motherboard to life.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Could have been a lot better if Franco had worked on a little country accent circa 1890 vs west coast surfer circa 2014. The premise and the writing were both weak. In general a lot of time was wasted on random little ideas va

1401937519|2.0|It is sad how many of us bought this book hoping to learn what \\"really\\" happens after death.  After reading this book (a couple times in case I found \\"something\\" insightful) it does not sound that this woman experienced death.  I mean actual death.  I was very disappointed in everything she wrote.  You and I have read this \\"stuff\\" time and time again...\\"love yourself\\".  I was truly looking for what happens after death.  It is NOT IN THIS BOOK!  I don't know if she was cured or not, if so I would consider it a miracle (my words).  She never speaks of God (or call him anything you want)..she never mentions how it is in the after death.....  my gosh wouldn't you?!  For instance (believe this or not)...I (and my husband) about 20 years saw a flying outer space object.  Large so close we thought it was going to hit us.  We are business people, educated.  Open minded....but truly we would not say this \\"unless\\" we were absolutely certain..  Both of us would take a lie detector test, we saw what we saw.  We could and would tell every single detail. I mean every detail!  She, in this book, told us nothing....I mean nothing.  Just what \\"she thinks\\".....even her words written do not sound like she speaks.  I have read Dr. Dyer's books, many at least the first 5......this book sounds more like him.  He too has changed....in the beginning he had an insight, which one could believe.<br />Again, I absolutely would not buy this one....it's not worth the paper it's written on.  I truly don't mean to be so frank, but this one is being shown as something you can learn about death....nope...it is what it is....a book to make money!  Sorry, but true.  (I know you will probably buy it like I did...this one is going in my rummage sale, I would not pass it on to anyone I know)...waste of your time to read!  I guess the answer is \\"all of us will never know until were \\"actually\\", permanently dead!  I wish you well...let's just try to enjoy today, believe what we believe.....and leave it at that!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|This movie was awful. I couldn't even sit through it.  I gave up after about a 1/2 hour and figured just because I paid to rent it didn't mean I had to suffer through it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I found this meter pretty easy to learn, and it has wonderful reproduction and sensitivity.  Display is easy to read.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|nice case, great protection, only drawback is flipping it open to answer the phone can be a pain, overall worth the price
B002UJIY7A|5.0|This one has it all....but not a lot of computer<br />generated crap to the point where you just might<br />as well be watching a cartoon........I mean people<br />are really acting in this movie. It's awesome!!!!
0385349947|4.0|I bought this book because there was so much hype on the social media about it.  Having read so many business books targetted at women, I was sure that this book was going to be much about the same.  To my surprise, this book was very engaging and motivating!  Sheryl is so honest in sharing her experiences as an ambitious female in her career, and she openly shares her opinion and views about the issues facing women in the workplace.  It was a truely inspiring book, and I greatly appreciate Sheryl for allowing all women to access her insights and encouragement. This is truely the best business book for women that I've read so far.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The aesthetic and music in this game would appeal to any pony fan, but the actual game is repetitive and dull. It is also not possible to complete many of the quests without social (which I don't allow my young kids to use) or money. To get Dashie and Rarity, you must spend real money - something like ten dollars I think. This game has probably made more sadness than fun for my kids, now that I really think about it.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|We enjoy Galaxy Quest so much that it is fun to gift it to someone who also finds it a great movie to watch more than once.
B00AGJ4HC2|3.0|This game is a great light short game.  Playtime is 15-30 minutes and the rules are pretty much restated on each card.  The only reason it is not getting 4/5 stars is because the cards are not the best quality, highly recommend card sleeves.
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Movie is great, Blu ray and DVD feature wonderful, but, Digital Copy Expiration Date is not April 30, 2015, it is 12/31/2012 -- that's right 2012!

Jack is Back and better than ever in this latest edition. Get your copy now!!

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Funny movie and loved the stars, they work well together. It had some very funny parts and some very sweet parts. This movie has a little something for everyone
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Having seen this show at least 5 times, the music just stays in your soul. The story is so real and heart wrenching. Recommend this to anyone who loves musical theatre.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Love the movie a beautiful story based on real life, the courage of a young girl, who learns how to do the thing she loves most!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish there were more levels. I enjoyed this game. I found myself wanting more. I hope they add more levels soon.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Started reading these books twenty-five years ago and they still spark my imagination. All young readers would enjoy this whether they notice the symbolism or not.

B00CSWA1PM|5.0|I saw the show during previews in early April and the cast recording just came our at the end of May.  I love it the more I listen to it the better it seems to get.  Makes me want to go back and see the show again. Its wonderful. I love &#34; I'm not my father's son&#34;

0679805273|5.0|I purchased this book for my 4 year old grandson as a graduation gift from Pre-k.  He loves to books and Dr. Seuss books are some of his favorites.  As he enters Kinder,  I can see him enjoying this book for several years to come.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Ruined the whole story for me . I seriously needed to go back to the previous book to remember what I've forgotten after the long wait , and what a disappointment ,,,, when you try to sum up this book , you come to the conclusion of no substance , just greed for money, I'm living the disappointment of Nora Roberts all over again , but at least she had the decency not to bull this none trilogy crap on us. No more crossfire novel for me , I had enough.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app works very good it even gives the name of songs just released. I downloaed it on my Samsung Note 2
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was so funny that my husband kept coming to check on me because was cracking up so much. Fun read, different than what is out there now, even from a male pov.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game. Seems like there are more level obstacles, and the zip line is great! I would recommend this game.
B002RI9MWA|3.0|Having heard about the upcoming film of this book - and a glowing commentary on the book by David on At the Movies - I ordered this book with keen interest. The premise is intriguing and topical - a secular muslim educated at Princeton and achieving in the US finance industry talking to a mysterious American in his hometown in Pakistan and slowly revealing his disillusionment with the West. But I found the tone unconvincing. And the accompanying love story was a strange and disconcerting distraction. But I can see that the concept could provide the basis for a great movie script so I look forward to seeing the movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I don't usually like subtitles, but I needed them for this one. I actually enjoyed it.Need to watch it again
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game was completely worth .99. Hours of enjoyment even though I'm starting to hate Greenland (in the game, of course, not real life)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very good game takes a while to make money but once you do you will love it. Very addictive. Hours of fun
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I love it! Addictive and outstanding, with a great cast!  Made me want to go and do historical research. Overall a great show, can't wait for what coming!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I kinda thought this would be bad cuz of the reviews but it's actually very good!  Download it now cuz it's awesome!
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|Insightful writing about &#34;American Africans&#34; provoked many thoughts and comparisons about class and race. This African American learned from & enjoyed much of this book. Author illustrates many choices made by Nigerian characters and impacts on themselves and others around them.  I found most of this book interesting and enjoyable.<br /><br />Sadly, I thought that the last part devolved into a boring romance novel.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I'm a 32 yr old and I play this game on my daughter's kindle fire and for some reason I can't stop playing it graphics are amazing
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great product to access your computer remotely. I use it because I'm lazy and don't want to get out of bed to shut my pc down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Have a hard time putting this game down. Definitely not one to take to work....would be in trouble o unless all the time!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The book might start off slow, but once you get into it it is really enticing. The storyline just sucks the reader in, as the reader you want to see what happens next. I liked how Mark Twain includes  humor into this book, it seems that thats how it would have been like in real life. He makes the characters feel so real, the reader feels as if they are in the book themselves!
B000EXZI14|4.0|The first time I listened to this live album, which I understand was their last one, I could tell that their voices were not as clear as 20 years earlier, which is to be expected. But, after listening to it a few times I realized that they had a more mature sound than their much earlier albums. So, it grows on you.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This app is fun for adults and really great for the little ones. My 3 and 4 year old daughters love it. It encourages them to exercise their critical thinking skills while having fun. Plus the little blob monsters are just too cute!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good information for anyone wanting to publish on Kindle.  Look forward to publishing my first book and many more after that.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story brought home all the sad realities of hardship which could be inflicted on a child and yet the child's heart and hope survive.  The merciless horrors of these real life orphanages were beyond suffering.  To think these places existed is to look at the dark side of religion and acknowledge that an organization, even one intended to foster hope and belief in God can be self serving and deeply flawed.  I gave this five stars because it appeals on so many levels and held my interest from the beginning to the very last page.  You know a book has touched you when you reach the last page and wish there was more.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The characters came alive to me in the first few chapters.  I soon found myself not able to put the book down.  Although predictable--I love predictable endings.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Movie... awesome. Lame attempt at making extra cash... well, LAME. James Franco is proving to be a versatile actor. I had my reservations in the spider man series. But then Pineapple Express. Since then he seems to reinvent himself in every role he takes on. The movie was well put together and as prequils go, it did the original justice. However, it has a long way to go before it becomes an icon such as the original Wizard... ENJOY!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Corn bread fruit! I didn't even read it!! No one reads dictionaries so I recommend this book to my worst enemies. Now leave me alone, I'm just trying to play subway surfers but this always keeps popping up.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i LIKE THE FACT THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO AN OUTLET TO USE MY KINDLE, GIVING ME MORE CHOICES.
B009IH0ICG|3.0|I previously had a Weber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter but since downsizing my grilling operations to a Smokey Joe thought this was a better fit. And it is a good fit in terms of charcoal amount for a small grill like the Smokey Joe but it really doesn't work as well as the larger size. Almost always need 2 newspaper sheets (one after the other) whereas on the larger unit one sheet was usually sufficient.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Adding that another reason for opting for the larger one is that the small one is pretty much unusable with lump charcoal. Many times I prefer lump charcoal and don't want to have to manually break it up before placing it in the chimney.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I found this app to be one of their best! it doesn't crash no viruses. it starts right away. wish all the apps were as good working such as tubemate it needs work you cant download without
193700788X|5.0|Charlaine kept the great storyline going.  She so could keep going now that Sookie is with Sam.  I truly am going to miss this but hey it is definitely a  great book to reread.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Since Hangover III was coming out, i had never seen the first 2.  So I ordered both of the older movies and they were great!!!  Too funny!<br />Actually HO one was better than HO two!
193700788X|1.0|Not what I expected.  The story as a whole and the ending felt as if written in a rush...just wanting to get it over with, and never look back.  So sad that Sookie ended up with Sam!  How did that happen?  They have been friends all along!  Too bad this series ended this way, disappointing so many followers.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love the CD. Met the young man in Washington DC over the 4th of July last year. Can't wat for his tour.
B000002O3I|5.0|These recordings represent the work of Howlin' Wolf in his prime.  The only warning I would give is that the sound quality is not comparable to current albums.  The 20th Century Masters album has better fidelity but lacks many of these songs.
B005O242D0|4.0|True to the author undistorted by later events. As the enemy in World War Two, his thoughts were deliberately twisted.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Hey, its Alien movies all together in one pack.  What else needs to be said?  I did watch Aliens directors cut and it did have a lot of extra footage in it.  Some of it I can see why they cut it out to shorten the movie, just did not add to the story.  A few cuts though did add a bit more background to the plot and the characters.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|A rather short series that sets the ground for the epic second series. Excellent acting and deep character portrayal. Well thought out and intelligent scoring. If you liked the films, you'll like this.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I read this novel for a class and loved every minute of it. It gives a good insight into the characters lives and the reality that life is very different in other cultures.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very handy app letting you know how long you have left to read, listen to music or play games. It is easy to read and attractive to look at.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I spend 5 days a week 1-2 hours a session in the pool and find that training with music makes my training substantially more enjoyable. I have, however, had a challenging time finding a dependable swim unit until I started using this neptune.<br /><br />I have gone through several different brands and models only to discover some hiccup with each model, which I do not have with this neptune.<br /><br />For instance: I tried the underwater UwaterG4 from Fitness Technologies and was extremely disappointed. Yes, it was the smallest unit available however the ear buds fall out of the ear during flip turn and then stop working, then when I tried to replace the ear buds, I could only order from that specific company because of the screw thread that makes the ear buds waterproof. Every time I swam, I was needing new ear phones and it was a pain so I stopped using the unit. This experience cemented my decision to stay away from 'waterproof' ear buds. This unit also had issues with continuos play and I had to hit the start button after each song played which was so very annoying.<br /><br />Then I started using the FINIS SwimP3. (The model before this neputne)<br /><br />I really like the SwimP3 however I wished that it had a screen so I could see what I was playing. I love the jawbone technology and was very happy with this unit for the year that I used it. I currently use it as my spare now in the event I forget to charge my neptune.<br /><br />Then I started using this Neptune and I have found it to be the perfect unit for me.<br /><br />I do not have any of the hassle of the ear buds falling out or not working because this uses the same jaw bone technology as the swimp3 which I really liked. I love that I have a screen to see what song I have set and my repeat/random settings. The unit clips onto my goggles so when I flip turn it does not fall out or move at all, and it is surprisingly light weight for it's size, I barely notice that it is there.<br /><br />When I went to load music on it, it was extremely user friendly. Plugged directly into my computer with no issues and it came with an easy to read step-by-step guide. I have a Macbook Pro and had no issues loading or unloading music.<br /><br />Finis also gets a +1 for their awesome version of Hotel California that they had preloaded on the unit.<br /><br />This unit offers everything that a swimmer needs with the least amount of hassle possible, I am a huge fan!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome I wish it had more levels and it sad to say that it got so hard that I had to find a walkthrough to pass some levels. But awesome can't wait for more levels. I would recommend to anyone who likes these kind of games.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|This product needs no more than this one word to describe it: Wow!! It is super easy to use, fitting snuggly against your cheek with nothing in the ear. Thus I can still swim with great technique whilst wearing it. The sound is of impeccable quality and I love the new OLED screen that allows me to scroll through my playlist and choose the song I want to listen to for that specific set! Long workouts are a greatly enhanced with this product and I highly recommend it!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The game is really cool but they should give you more stuff in the beginning that's the only reason why but every thing else is pretty good
030758836X|4.0|This book was captivating almost from the begininnng.  I always love the narratives from different perspectives and at first the characters are both likeable and interesting.  Many times throughout the story I was shocked and compelled to read more.  It rruly is a great mystery.<br /><br />The ending has left me angry.  I am angry at the wekness and apathy of the characters.  I am angry at the sick, twisted relationship but I suppose that is the point.<br /><br />Thanks for a great week, Gone Girl.
0385535147|5.0|Lots of twists and much more of a tale than seen in first few chapters. Enjoyable read. Give it a try.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I downloaded another alarm clock that was a FAOTD a while ago, and just uninstalled it because it NEVER went off. Thought maybe it was because I forgot to turn the sound on my Kindle up, but nope, the app just sucked.<br />I got this one as a backup because I always either accidentally shut my phone alarm off or hit snooze too many times. Now I won't even be using my phone for backup, because this one is really foolproof. After not sleeping for a couple of days because of two jobs and school, I had set this for 10:30 this morning with the intention of getting up to finish school work I need to catch up on. I ended updates hitting the snooze button until after noon, but it NEVER shut off on me. I have issues where I go days with little sleep bc I have so much on my plate, then I crash and sleep through my alarm until it shuts itself off, which is usually after a couple of minutes. Or I hit the snooze button until it stops, usually after the third time I hit it. I won't need to worry here, this app doesn't shut itself off for anything except you hitting the tiny button telling it to. In contrast the snooze button is HUGE, so you can't inadvertently hit off when you meant to hit snooze. Also it will turn your Kindle back on from a sleep state, and if you forgot you muted your device, it will take care of that for you too. REALLY FOOLPROOF!<br />Only 2 drawbacks, but still 5 stars bc everything else is so good. 1. I had to download a free alarm clock sound because the one included wasn't annoying enough to be effective for me. 2. I can't find a way to listen to an alarm sound in advance, except for setting the alarm for a minute from now. That could be my own stupidity though. Still a 5 star app.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great acting.  Love the way they put tips on the screen to show the view what Sherlock is noticing at the crime scene.
1575666286|5.0|Do not believe in the greed-driven American Medical industry, backed by Big Pharma. Reversal of dis-ease in the body requires natural nutrition to rebalance and restore good health. The Gerson Therapy works and I've already seen big improvement to my health. This book arrived in new condition. Never give to the hoax of a billion dollar Cancer &#34;research&#34;, since they only want to find a solution to your healthy through profitable drugs, all of which have serious side effects. Just listen to the ads on TV and the pending  class action suits for damage and death done by properly-prescribed prescription drugs! I'm an RN and I stay away from Doctors, since they don't understand nutrition or the healing process of the body. Many drugs cause disease and they pretty-much all harm the body's immune system.. &#34;Let food be your medicine and medicine by your food&#34; as wisely stated by Hippocrates! The Gerson Therapy by Dr. Max Gerson proves to be a threat to the medical industry. (poisoned twice to ensure his demise, since his knowledge reversed dis-ease and took away from the greed-driven allopathic poison/cut/burn barbaric control over ignorant people. In addition, due to medical administrator's goal of profit, a hospital is not a safe place due to the insane high nurse to patient ratio. This wide-spread practice to heavily burden nurses to make more profit totally refutes any concern for patient's health. That being said, this book is a God-send! Albert Schweitzer stated correctly that Dr. Gerson was an intuitive genius after Gerson cured him of diabetes and cured his family members of other diseases...! .

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|JIMI at his very best. the cover picture of him is amazing. it's in 3 d i can't take my eyes off of it. what a shame we lost him so early in his career. this man shaped the face,body, and soul of blues/rock. thank god for Buddy Guy, sounds as though Buddy has some of Jimi's soul. Gone, JIMI, But Never Forgotten!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome!!!! I have played this game 92 times and I'm in level 7. It helps pass time by. Hope you enjoy it!!!!!!
1416972250|5.0|This book was purchased for my daughter. This is the third in the series that she has read. She loves this book and the series.
B00CISC244|4.0|Tomorrows Harvest is a great addition to the Boards of Canada collection. The vinyl version comes with a download card for MP3 version of the album. I was especially impressed at the arrangement. Each side of the vinyl (about 4 tracks per side, 4 sides) seemed like its own mini experimental album. It was great! Don't fret if you don't have the time for the whole album, just pick a side and play it!
B002HSSAY6|5.0|This is probably the greatest western I have ever seen.  It's not fast moving - plenty of marvelous closeups - and time to think.  The background music is fantastic.  Sergio Leone outdid himself, as he did with Once upon a Time in America.  This is a western for thoughtful movie buffs.
B0050546IM|5.0|Vinyl version comes with an MP3 download card. Beautiful white vinyl with gorgeous labels and sleeve. My favorites on this album include 'Eyes Be Closed', 'Amor Fati', and 'Before' but the album as a whole is excellent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Face it - it's a soap opera but what a soap opera.  I wish Amazon would let me stream Season 3, but alas I'm waiting at the library for it.  The cast seems so real, and the overall production is outstanding.  It compares favorably to Upstairs Downstairs.
B001GJ30Y2|5.0|The Vinyl version I received came with a CD of the abum and a free MP3 download card. Great 2 LP album, very much M83.
159448385X|5.0|When I read &#34;The Kite Runner,&#34; I was in awe of the amazing story that Khaled Hosseini weaved with this words and the events he created to lead to its end. This story continues that. He creates real, life-like situations that make you think. Amazing story.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The reason I gave this cord a 1* rating is because the item I ordered it for my Kindle Fire it does not work with.<br />It may work perfectly fine with other micro USB tablets as it is suppose to be universal just not for my purpose.<br />In all fairness maybe I did not do enough research on product.
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|I was having different leather case before I purchased this and it wasn't have good quality as this one.<br /><br />1st, I liked the material of the leather so much, even my friend love it and I liked the way when the phone locked and unlocked by closing the case and opening it.<br /><br />2nd, the only thing it's not good at, it's the protection, when my phone fall it's didn't protect it and cuz of that the screen get broken and it cost me more than 200$ for fixing my phone.<br /><br />the case is not protecting the corners of the phone and this is more important.<br /><br />if u look for design and quality this one is great, but if look for protection I prefer to look for another case.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Keeps my I5 over-clocked to 4.5 Ghz @ 26 degrees &#34;C&#34; at idle and 40 degrees &#34;C&#34; at full 100% load.<br /><br />Great cooler and no leaks to worry about.<br /><br />Highly recommended !!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story was great but not realizing this was part1 of a trilogy. I had just spent a lot of emotional energy getting to the end then to find out I have two more to read. So I did not like the ending at all.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Why spend another $100.00 when this processor will do everything the I7 will do.<br />No problems at all. Installed in a Gigabyte Z77 board, over-clocked to 4.5 and away we go.<br /><br />Very fast boot time with SSD drive. Blink your eyes and your up and running.<br /><br />Highly recommended !!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|You give me the kind of feeling  that is wanted and needed everyday on the scale to 1&10  I am at a 100  I can't get enough I can't stay away if you need it I got it comes in everyway
B00190OHD6|5.0|I watched this movie with my 15 yr old daughter and we loved it.  It was quite touching.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|...I just wish the movie was as good!  Every now and then it happens; a musical score elevates a film, as is the case here (making it watchable).
B00BLSJI80|5.0|You can hear the maturity in Demi Lovato's voice if you compare it with her past albums. It's not an album you should miss and it doesn't really broadcast &#34;teeny bopper&#34; anymore.
B008393Q2O|4.0|Had been unsuccessful trying multiple notes apps.  Have found THE ONE.  Very user friendly, love the multiple color catagories and that you can line out the finished items.  One thing I would love to see is when an item is completed and checked off, it should move to the bottom below the 'still undone' tasks.  Otherwise they are filling up screen space, when they should be out of eye sight since they are completed.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It's ok, I would prefer it to be like the regular youtube icon on droid or iphone.... do better by replacing it with the regular youtube
B00005N6KG|5.0|If you want something that blocks out all external noise don't get these - they won't. My wife & I use these to run with. We wanted something lightweight, comfortable, that stays on while we exercise, and allow us to have awareness of traffic etc. These fit the bill nicely. They are flexible so they travel well - we usually fold them up into our sunglasses cases. They (and previous similar versions) seem to last ~ 5 years before falling apart. We do abuse them with our travel (sometimes they just get thrown into the carry-ons.
B009B2VBWE|5.0|I love the fact that she sings the blues and jazz the way you should be sung.she has an amazing voice and ability to use it.
0060090367|2.0|Not a great book especially since it seems to take forever to get this girl to stop living in self pity.  I'm having a hard time finishing it - or even getting to the middle.  I'm more of an Outlander fan - so this style isn't for me.  I got this on the recommendation of an acquaintance - and now know not to tell her about the Outlander series.  She's not ready for something that dynamic!
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|I have seen most of the other productions of this drama.  in spite of the choice of the great actors I do of the director seemed to ignore the major points of the story.  The movie did not follow the book in really showing the real conflict with the convention of the time with the desire of the characters.  Rochester's character was grim all through which was not true in the book.  Why didJane fall in love with this person?  the only point in this production to me was the scenery.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I was expecting a cheesy PG-13 action movie trying to be badass ala The Brothers Grimm (with Matt Damon and Heath ledger) or Sucker Punch. Instead I found myself with a big smile because this movie knew exactly what it wanted to be, a fun Rated-R gory actionfest that doesnt hold back. This is the type of movie I wished Mortal Kombat was. People get torn apart, explode with guts and brains spewing all over the place, head stomped like grapes, etc. If you enjoy fun violence like a Robert Rodriguez flick (Front Dusk Til Dawn, Machete, Planet Terror) then you will like the action here. The runtime is short, and thats a good thing. We have Witch Hunters, and they are hunting witches. The end. We dont want it longer. Very fun movie that will get repeat viewings from me. Keeps you entertained from start to end.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book that takes you out of reality and puts you in a whole new world. I was hesitant at the thought but Katniss is a string individual and not a weak girl. Can't wait to start the next one!
0679805273|5.0|I plan on having my 2 granddaughters' teachers write something about them at the end of each school year and give the book to them after the 8th grade.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This third book in the trilogy was disappointing. A very obvious stretch to make more money, now that the series is to be extended to five books. Will not be purchasing the rest of this series. You can ask for a refund within 7 days of your purchase by going to Manage my Kindle in your account, finding the book, clicking on the arrow and choosing the option to receive a refund.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love the variation of the game from arcade to classic. helps not to get boring. my favorite is the arcade with star. just a fun game
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My little 5 and 2 yr olds love to play and &quot;help&quot; me play the harder levels. (They love just watching and cheering.) Can't get enough Cut the Rope.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone who loves the collaboration of these two great artists.  A definite must for your collection of blues.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|There so many things you can say about this album after a few listenings, sure it's a solid release above my expectations and the sound it's rich and bold. There is no doubt about it, if I would need to define it with a quote, I think this is a \\"Classic Sabbath album!!!\\"
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app is awesome and much much better than games like epidemic which I can't stress enough is a bad game. It has a very nice interface and is good for passing time.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|This is an awesome album and Adele at her best. I think it is a collection of her best works to date.<br />This is a purchase that would be considered money well spent and you can not beat the fact that about<br />30 seconds after you pay you have the music to enjoy listening to, it's a win win, buy, listen, and enjoy.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Love the huge variety of music styles, vocals, and just the breath of different piano visions they create.  I have listened to this CD over and over!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Good Holmes rendition and well acted. Looking forward to the new season! Only thing I want is more episodes..now! LOL
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Dramatic emotions and visions!  The depth and richness of these instruments is soothing at times, and also creates ambition and energy!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I have used this very minimally but the feel is fantastic. I love the feel of it and the size, I will update if it does not hold up to its reputation when school starts in august!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Alicia has a hard row to hoe and does it with such class. This is one of the best shows on TV. It has been fun to watch it all again
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|This movie was pretty bad.  It was poorly directed and the actors look really bored (especially Franco, who looks like he's on painkillers the whole time).  The story wasn't engaging at all, and relies on a  really cheesy and cliche \\"crazy woman scorned\\" narrative. Finally, there is an over reliance on CGI that doesn't look all that great to begin with and will only look worse in a few years.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is easy to use for quick basic math functions. I use it figure pay checks and bills weekly. My daughter also practices her math skills on it.
1416914307|5.0|I loved this book.  It came to me in a timely manner.  Packaging was good.  Condition of book was good.  I will be sad when I complete the series.  Thank you Denise
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|This is one of those movies that struggles to stay up with the music.  Ennio Morricone is pure genius and the soundtrack is fantastic.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This wacky comedy series presents interesting characters with a lot of, albeit far-fetched, science.  There seems to be an underlying theme of people working together to improve the human experience through learning and discoveries.  Eureka is light and pleasing!
B002BWP49M|5.0|Another great segment in this very different love story. The special effects are awesome.  It's really a good lead in to the final chapter.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|It helps to appreciate this film if you have seen the earlier more serious film Yossi and Jagger. Yossi and Jagger introduces the character of closeted Yossi who loses his lover Jagger because of war, and he is only able to verbalize his love when Jagger is dying. Even after Jagger's death nobody knows the depth of their relationship.<br />Forward ten years to Yossi the film. He is now a doctor who is alone, sad, and still grieving for Jagger. This film is somewhat lighter in tone in that there are comic moments as Yossi tries to get into the gay scene with less than satisfying results.<br />He meets a young soldier with whom he has an immediate connection. The young soldier is able to bring Yossi back to really living and loving. There are second chances if you will take them. Ultimately this is a very sweet romantic film.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe at his best. Great CD includes acoustic versions of Joe's other CDs selected songs, but the acoustic version surpasses the electric guitar version. The musicians play as if they've been playing together for years. This is a wonderful example of &#34;the whole is more than the some of its parts&#34;. Well done.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|As she often does, the author takes characters and situations familiar to readers and weaves a story that keeps you involved to the last page.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|This is the type of syfy show I love, the mad scientist it's right in the middle of it, alternate Universes, the fearless government (FBI) team dealing in only the weirdest cases.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Contra was a great album, but Modern Vampires of the City is better. This album travels a bit away from what us fans are used to, but I honestly think that it is a good different rather than a bad different. The tracks Obvious Bicycle, Diane Young, Everlasting Arms and Worship you were the highlights for me, but in a album of good songs it's hard to say.<br /><br />There are albums that are good (a few good songs), albums that are great (A few bad songs) and albums that are amazing where every single song is great and no disappointments exist. This is an amazing album.
0345525558|4.0|I found it very interesting learning about the definitions of the flowers, otherwise I was very frustrated with Victoria's lifestyle.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I have listened to this entire album at least 40 times.<br /><br />There is rapping in this album, however I don't believe that it detracts from the music at all. I would even go on to say that the rapping adds to the music. In the song Broken Arrow, the rapping is perhaps the most pronounced, because it takes up a majority of the song. I found the rapping to be tasteful and not out of place at all. I think that at heart, The Script is a band that values both vocals and spoken word. It's \\"their thing\\" and it's what makes them them.
B008BT1060|5.0|Influenced by Faure, Debussy, Ravel, Saint-Saens and later Messiaen, one of his contemporaries, French composer Henri Dutilleux's self critical approach to his music has meant that his life works is relatively small, around 50 pieces. He has rejected almost all of his work written before his Piano Sonata of 1947, considering it too stereotypical of French music as all charm, elegance and wit. The net result of this is a box set of 5CDs offering most of his orchestral, chamber and concerto works, plus all of his solo piano compositions.<br /><br />Much of this work consists of small, subtle, teasing melodic passages developing into larger themes before falling away to be redeveloped and re-evolved. I find this so much more accessible than the rigid atonal and serial music typical of the 20th Century - there's something here for my ears to latch on to, and I can enjoy listening to the music progress and expand while still retaining a degree of coherence which I can understand and enjoy. Also though, there are some starkly concentrated pieces such as Ainsi la nuit (Thus the Night) which is evocative, mysterious and at times difficult to listen to, but it simply grabs attention and makes it, for me, compelling listening.<br /><br />The recordings on this set are all good. The earliest is a very good 1954 mono version of Le Loup, the Symphony No 1 is from 1977, and the rest are from the 1990's and 2000's. All performers and venues are detailed in the booklet which also gives a brief biography and account of the enclosed works.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This is the third episode is this series of futuristic alien movies. It is Funny and entertaining for the entire family.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|It is a shame this movie did not become the classic hit it should have. One of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. I enjoy it more every time I watch it.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I've read all the books in this series and they are WELL WORTH reading. The movie does resemble the books but is nowhere as interesting.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My daughter and I stumbled upon &#34;Once Upon A Time&#34; season 1 while checking out Netflix for something to watch...we fell in love after the 1st episode!  We quickly finished the first season and were ready to move on to season 2, lucky for us it was available at Amazon!
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|Setup and install was easy - Driver and windows install went easy and the bios is as easy or as technical as you want it to be via settings. I have been an Asus believer<br />for many years and many motherboards (and other items) since I know their quality is real good and their tech support/warranty support is excellent. I used my existing<br />cooler-master hyper 212 which fits perfectly. The only other thing extra I put in was a cables to go external E-sata adapter since this board has no external e-sata.<br /><br /> If this is your first motherboard install make sure that your case has install hardware as this unit has none.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|Movies not nearly as good as the books.  They skip a lot of really important information and I feel that if I hadn't read the books I wouldn't be able to follow the plot.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am a James Bond fan and this is one of the better ones. It seems to get better after you have watched it a few times.
B005HSL626|5.0|vs with my dad on his iphone. I beat him. we had so much fun with this app! happy costumer.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This a cute little puzzle game. Beautiful animations. The music is a bit repetitive, and if you're familiar with Quell you will see that there is a similarity, but still it is quite enjoyable.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So good. I READ this book in 1 day, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommended it. The story draws you in and keeps you interested in the characters.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Django had a nice story arc,  good acting but brutal at times in violence.  Quite a bit of dry humor and all the major actors did a great job of playing their characters with cameo appearances from stars of the 70s and 80s. Who knew Don Johnson of Miami Vice could play the leader of Klu Klux Clan only to be shot down like a dog by Django.
B007Z9RS22|5.0|This movie shows two romantic leads at their best.  Both actors are believable and endearing in these roles.This a good movie to watch when you need to remember to live and love in the moment.
B00004D2YN|1.0|it did not play o my dvd players and it would not play on my ps3 i was very mad!!!
B008EDGBW6|4.0|This young man may have a crazy personal life but his music is always wonderful!! I have three teens and they actually enjoy my pics!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|For those of us who like problem solving and are into science fiction this storey is a winner ,would make a great movie.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|This is ok, the shell kinda feels cheap. But it looks great. The kick stand works on flat surfaces better than on non flat surfaces.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|to ban danceing and music or certain kirnd of music is crazy because one group of kids wanted to be careless. was good to see it only takes one person to stand up  for he or she believes in. like in the movie others will  follow
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best game that I have ever played. The game is almost the exact same thing as the show. I really get very entertained by the best game.
193700788X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the series and I thought that it was the kind of ending Sookie needed. A quick nicely paced read
B000FBJAEG|5.0|David Baldacci knows how to write an excellent book.  He captures you on page 1 and continues to enwrap you in the story until he expertly unties the mystery.  You will be thoroughly engrossed from start to finish!
0312379293|5.0|Mr. Archer must do extensive research to give us such glorious characters and glimpses into the past.  This is a wonderful story of triumph but still the emptiness of revenge.  I really enjoy this man's work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Such a good game and really good for any age. There are a few hard things to figure out but once you have realised it all makes sense and you get a good feeling!I would recommend this to anyone!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I have been listening to this masterpiece over and over and over again for the past 24 hours.  It makes me want to get better headphones, it makes me want to get bigger speakers.  It's that good.  I haven't felt this way since listening to NIRVANA NEVERMIND in 1991.<br /><br />This soundtrack is amazing, congratulations and thank you to Hans Zimmer and everyone involved.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|Uses a battery a day.  Other than that it works ok.  Can't think of anything else to say about this product
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Takes me back...... I highly recommend.  Not completely true to history, but still exciting and fun.  A must have in every movie collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a whole lot chanlleging than the first one they created that's I thinks its great and people should like it or if you don't give it a chance
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was a surprise to me.  A straightforward one at that. You need to read this book. It gives hope without prejudice.  I feel strengthened by this account a peaceful feeling that we all matter. Life after death.
074401493X|4.0|I went to order this guide from amazon until i saw the \\"usually ships within 1-3 months\\". How can you say that for a guide for a game that just game out a day ago. So i ended up getting it locally for a dollar more. It's a really nice guide as far as game guides go these days. Plenty of information to help you out along the way. A little high priced as there is very little difference between it and the paperback version though.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|5+++++++ Stars<br /><br />Gideon Cross. Pfft...what a hunk of alpha male.<br /><br />Seriously. This book was one of my all time, most anticipated book releases. And trust-you-me, it didn't fail either.<br /><br />The love story of Gideon and Eva is met with so many twists and turns, you have to wonder, \\"Can they survive this after all they have already been through?\\" And then you flip the page and you're met with another twist or another turn in the chain-of-events and somehow, their true love conquers all.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending of this book, although, it is NOT the last book in the series (need I 'mind you), but I was thoroughly thrilled to see what happened actually happened. (Whoa, talk about some cryptic writing, eh?)<br /><br />The very tail end of this book definitely left me feeling like it was just left hanging a bit too much for any of my lovely cliff hangers but I guess I will just have to get a release date on Crossfire Book # 4 and start the dreadful countdown once again. I mean seriously, who loves having to wait MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS.........AND....MONTHS!! for a book release to happen in one of their favorite series? Pfft, not this girl!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|BEST READ EVER!!! I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN!!! BUY IT, DOWNLOAD IT!!!  YOUR GOING TO LOVE IT!!!  SO MUCH FUN
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game I downloaded.Decent graphics,fun different rooms with different voices.Sometimes it freezes but it's better then most games &  the music is a nice touch.I like the fact you have challenges for each room.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|great app everything is real I have never typed in something not real but some stuff is odd all in all great app
B007SGM084|3.0|it is to repetitive... To unpredictable  They are making love every two pages !!! To god to be true. It's a fantasy.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|As with all Stephen King books this is extremely well written with great character development. However, much of the book itself was plodding along with limited action or causes for you to have imagination. Not the best, but worth a read.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It was so awesome<br />I can't tell you  how good it is<br />Get it please<br />Super fun<br />I played it and everything was awesome in the game
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I am astonished at the negative reviews which seem for the most, guilty of their own criticism; critically incoherent and childishly petulant. The film has arresting characters and astonishing characterizations, exemplary visuals, great editing and an evocative musical and philosophical narrative. Seriously - what does it take to please you grumps? Your xboxes broken?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|love this game!! It is super fun and super worth it. It's free, what can you loose?? Nothing, if you don't like it delete it from your device :D
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My sister Joan told me about a year ago I needed to read this, but never thought I would enjoy it. It takes awhile to get familiar with all the names, places, etc...but once you do...WOW!  Really enjoyed it and now can't wait to buy the second one!  Thanks Sis! :)
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A wonderful feel-good movie. Predictable, but still great fun! Clint Eastwood is always good, and I love Amy Adams. Good movie.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this games and have played it over and over. Highly recommended. Great time waster. I enjoy this more than Candy Crush.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've read WWZ just a week before the movie comes out. I'm sure I'll be disappointed in the movie now as it will never be able to contain all the detailed storytelling from the book. I intended for this book to last for two weeks; I finished it in five days.
B00164GDD2|5.0|The picture and sound are great.  And . . . the ONLY thing Missing: There was NO DIGITAL COPY!!  The extras are extremely interesting to watch and give you a lot of insight to the restoration of everything from the film to Ecto-1.
193609648X|5.0|The book is awesome!  It has patterns that are easy to follow.  Great illustrations through out the book.  Thank you for the quick delivery.
0307476464|3.0|(NO SPOILERS)<br /><br />I honestly enjoyed reading through the book.  That alone could be biased, however, because I was reminded of the time I spent in Japan.  While reading I kept drawing conclusions and recognizing patterns and was looking forward to resolution.  And while we do get some conclusions, Murakami leaves this novel largely unfinished and the reader's theories unaddressed.  I was satisfied while reading but unsatisfied when it was over.<br /><br />I realize that this is three books compiled into one volume.  This might by why Murakami has failed to finish what he started: he's unable to go back and change the first book!  He found himself stuck without the imagination to finish it.  This might also be the reason that the book is annoyingly repetitive and twice as long as it should be.  But since parts one and two were selling before it was finished, it's understandable; and shortening the compilation would make it a different version.<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />(COMPLAINTS & SPOILERS TO FOLLOW)<br /><br />Patterns, patterns, patterns! - Besides the obvious patterns or connections--Tengo and Aomame as kids, Eri talking like Tsubasa, Aomame's friends' method of dying--there are a good dozen patterns that are never mentioned.  Tengo and Tamaru's similar body-size, for example.  The old lonely dowager was a female version of old Professor Ebisu.  Eri being shut up in a room while Aomame was in her room.  Ushikawa's married life being similar to Tengo's father's life.  Tengo and Aomame being 10, Eri escaping at 10, Tsukasa being 10.  None of these and more are ever mentioned.  \\"Book Four: The Final Conclusion,\\" needs to be written.<br /><br />Advertising - Are authors throwing in advertising these days?  I don't read modern fiction, maybe because I don't want to read about iPads, Facebook, and terrorist bombings.  I read to escape this world not to see another similar version of it.  I saw a lot of name-brand clothing in the book (Japanese are huge into expensive clothing).  I read a James Patterson novel and it was sickening the way he would say, \\"She took pictures with her Canon camera.\\"  No mention of photography other than that line.  No use of the pictures she took.  Why Canon?  Advertising.  Sellouts.  Also odd in 1Q84 was the use of CD players and Nike gym bags in 1984.  Yes, they existed, but I doubt a 80 year old widow would have a CD player in 1984.<br /><br />Translation - I speak Japanese but others do not!  There are, I feel, many things that the reader doesn't get explained.  A friend read the book and didn't really understand that Japanese last names are places or things.  You don't really even get an explanation of ao = green and mame = peas.  There are other places and things that go unexplained.  I'm sure most readers were begging for footnotes, especially when discussing something of the Japanese language.<br /><br />Filler - Much of what is explained in the book lacks any significance whatsoever.  I bet you could fill 50 pages which the explanation of how Tengo, Aomame, and Ushikawa cooked their meals, stretched, slept, woke, sat around, drank, walked, looked at the sky, went to the bathroom, etc (yes, they were always alone while doing these things).  Not only could this be minimized, but Murakami continuously repeats things over and over.  For example, the few connections that are addressed and repeated until they're not interesting anymore.  The book could be 500 pages or less.<br /><br />Magical Connections - After there are some real connections to be made, the mystery lies in how it will all be put together.  How did Ushikawa realize Tengo and Aomame were connected?  Oh, he just guessed!  It's also great how Aomame recognizes a disguised Ushikawa in the dark having had never seen him before.  There's one point where Tengo is daydreaming and seeing himself when he, as a 10 year old boy 20 years ago, held Aomame's hand.  He searches his memories and realizes that while Aomame was holding his hand she was looking outside.  What was she looking at?  Well the moon, of course!  And this little titbit of implausibility is what makes Tengo go to the park--which is conveniently located by Aomame's safehouse--and eventually be spotted by Aomame.  So the few connections that Murakami does make are magical, implausible stretches of the imagination.  The reader doesn't buy it.<br /><br />By the way, how are Aomame and Tengo connected?  Well, they were both outcasts in grade school due to their parents' work and religion; and they did hold hands once in class 20 years ago but....yep, that's it.  The book was based on magical beings called the little people (whom are never explained) knowing the internal secrets of two 30 year olds who for some reason just happen love one another based on holding hands once when they were 10 and not having seen each other since.  Uh-huh.<br /><br />There are so many more questions that go unanswered:<br /><br />What become of the little people?<br />Who becomes the new leader?<br />Why did Komatsu temporarily act like a dohta?<br />Where'd Tsukasa go?<br />Where'd Eri go?<br />Why the long explanation of Tamaru's friend pulling rats out of chunks of wood?<br />How does Aomame know it was Tengo in the park?<br />How does Ushikawa know it was Aomame at the apartment building?<br />Why is Aomame pregnant?  Why is it Tengo's?<br />Why did Sakigake want Aomame?<br />What happened to Sakigake's offshoot?<br />What about the young girls who rape Leader when he is paralyzed with an erection?<br /><br />And that's just what I remember off the top of my head.  To conclude, it was an enjoyable read.  After knowing what I just told you, however, and you know nothing is concluded, you might not enjoy it.  Forget this review and Then read it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|So easy to read.  This book held my attention the entire two days it took me to read it.  Enjoy
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|Another hokey love story from the Hollowood 50's (not anywhere near reality).  A no-brain, watch it and be quiet movie.  My kind of show but maybe not your first choice.  That's the way it goes.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|The setlist is superb, however i miss Desert Plains<br />But the only thing i really have a complains is that the stage prodution isn´t at Judas Priest´s level. The crowd, also, is very cold.
B006E2VTG2|5.0|I should have watched this movie months ago. It was an action packed movie. Zoe Saldana was a great choice for the part. I have to look up more movies by her on Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks
B00CM96A60|5.0|OK, I might be a little biased since I am a huge Armin fan(since 1999), I've seen him perform in SF, LA, Las Vegas, and Miami, and sometimes I only go to music festivals only if he is going to be there.  His latest album is his best work to date IMHO, and I think it is the best trance album since Ferry Corsten's Twice In A Blue Moon.  It's rare that I can listen to an entire album without skipping to the next song, and I can only name a handful of trance albums that are like that.  To be honest, I'm glad Tiesto sold out and switched to house because now there is no question in anyone's mind that Armin is the best progressive trance DJ in the universe(back in the day Tiesto was the best but that quickly changed).  I have seen Armin perform at Marquee in Las Vegas countless of times and it is just amazing how he can control the crowd.  Not many DJ's can do the same at that level.  Most recently I saw him perform with W&W at Story night club in Miami during WMC and Ultra week and that was one of the best live experiences I have ever been a part of!  He basically plays the best of the best and it just so happens that many of the best songs out right now are from his album Intense!!<br />This album has so many good songs, it reminds of the first time I listened to ATB's Movin' Melodies. I remember standing in the Virgin Megastore in 1998 listening to that album from beginning to end I was so impressed. I can honestly say I like every track on the album with my favorites being Beautiful Life, Waiting For The Night, Alone, Forever Is Ours and Who's Afraid Of 138.  I am a sucker for vocal trance, especially with female vocals, and Armin definitely produced some of the most chilling and melodic tracks in a long time.<br />If you like hip/trendy vocal progressive trance then you will definitely like this album I guarantee it!
B007EECSFA|3.0|It was a really long book! Sometimes I wondered if it would ever get anywhere. However, I'd  already read so much, I couldn't  quit. Ultimately, it did end. Nice resolution, good story. I'd have enjoyed it more if it moved a little faster.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it kept you on your toes and you never would have guess the ending.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Well as a 10 year DJ vet i can say that this band was cool when I was 12 years old and \\"Around the World\\" came out. This album had no beat, no climatic build to any of the songs, and it almost sounded the same on every track. Its like they didn't know how to just do what they wanted to do. It sounded like they didnt want to evolve with the music but forced themselves to do so. Almost like a demo or trial album. Daft punk is an icon in Electronica. Why would they waist all that money on marketing and then push that crap out. I would say stop the crap. If you dont keep it real and original you will never make it. I am learning that the hard way as this album will teach everyone a lesson. The whole voice changer thing is played out. But that doesnt mean make a non dance album and call it electronica. It sounded like it was created in FL studio or with an old floppy drive mixer. Please retire or push out a product like you had in 1997. The 90's were awesome. Bring it back like snap backs. Seriously Daft Punk A$$es.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I just match I'm not sure what to do when a jewel on fire shows up...  And then I run out of time
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Even if you're not an animal lover if you haven't seen it or read the book, I highly recommend this one!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I heard the 1977 edition of RTF with Joe Farrell up at Ohio Weslyan in Delaware Ohio. Great concert in spite of the heat & the amount of smoking material being consumed by the crowd.<br />This recording proves the band & the material still holds up. Good performances & recording. Now I kick my self for missing this concert when they were here in Columbus.
0525425772|4.0|I did like this book, but it does take a long time to actually get to the main plot of the story. It does keep your interest with all the jumping from one disaster to another. One other thing about this series of books I'd like to address is the fact that each book goes on with a new story line without giving the information the reader needs for closure on the last. Case in point: Was the husband convicted and sentenced for killing his wife in a previous book?
B000060O58|5.0|The re-mastering, the performances are all top shelf. No reason to hesitate, buy this now. there is no reason to hesitate on this recording.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I was so happy to get this deal & overly pleased with the value and content.<br />Best complete series that I own!
1400165172|5.0|Enjoyable to listen too.... I enjoy anything 'Sherlock Holmes'. This CD of several stories is a nice addition to my MP3 to listen to while working around the farm. No problem distinguishing between which character is speaking. Fast delivery by Amazon.
0785125965|5.0|People read World War Hulk for all the wrong reasons. I didn't buy the World War Hulk TPB for the plot. That's what the Planet Hulk series was for. I purchased this graphic novel to see Hulk friggin Smash. What's the point of having an in depth storyline when Hulk is basically trying to get his revenge throughout the whole series? Just sit back and enjoy the show (splash pages galore and all).
1781162646|3.0|If this was written by anyone else I'd say \\" nice job\\"  good summer read.....but were talking about Stephen King here!!  I'm chasing the dragon for his old days but sad to say sometimes it's better to exit on a high note.  Except for Gillian Flynn who comes a distant second, I've yet to see anyone do Horror like the King but the king has left the bulding :(
B00821OX98|5.0|a very good seires.my kids love there is nothing wrong with the movie and will always watch it.best movie i see yet.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I never write reviews, but this book was getting so much hate that I had to. I love the story between Gideon and Eva and the fact that it continues on is wonderful. I did start reading this book knowing it would not be the final book in the series, so that may have helped since I was mentally prepared to be left hanging. The story was great and the love between Gideon and Eva grows stronger. I can't wait to see what is in store for the next couple of books. Just go into this book knowing you will not get closure with the series and you will enjoy the read.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie the plot was nice, and it made me think about humanity and the way in which we treat one another.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wonderful book. I love the Gideon and Eva story. Love truly can conquer all. Sylvia Day is wonderful. Her books are totally awesome
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is amusing, but there are tons of notifications. Very annoying. Sometimes the game glitches out with the ads when first starting up.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Again, Martin is descriptive and sells another bestseller, but the book can NOT be compared to the tv series!  This is the third book in a six book series, and just when you think you have an idea of what might happen next, an interesting twist of events is played out again. The story just seems to have no end, which is why I was challenged in writing this review, as I am sure the producers also met the same challenges.<br /><br />If you read the first two books, you know that Martin's writing is a challenge, and it is key to read slowly and carefully. Also, to back up your reading, note the key differences and watch the HBO series which is not for the feint of heart. Finally, after you have unleashed the pages of this book don't waste your time-Get the fourth book \\"Feast for Crows,\\" before Season four in March 2014. Happy Reading GOT fans!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Most Excellent very cool and unlike many other artists Viva La France 8 more words required:-)<br />Viva La France Go Robots Go!!
B00005BPKD|5.0|I have 2 kids...a 6 year old boy and a 4 year old girl.  Neither one knows how to swim yet (although the 6 year old seems to think he can).  I purchased one of these for my kids and figured I'd also purchase a cheap $5 styrofoam kick board from Target.  My kids loved this one.  My little girl will also use the Target kick board...but this one is her favorite.  I went on vacation with my sister-in-law and her kids (also 4 years old and 6), and all 4 kids fought over this inflatable kick board.  I'm going to purchase a 2nd one of these...they really are awesome!<br /><br />Pros:  Very well made!  My kids love it!  Children seem to stay on it comfortably and haven't fallen off.<br /><br />Cons:  All of the kids want to use it...so if you have more than one child...buy more than one or expect fighting over it.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|I got half way through the movie and stopped.  After a while I finished the movie.  I really wish I would have stuck with it.  The movie was inspiring.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I am not one to overload my phone (Motorola RAZR MAXX HD) with apps but decided to try this. Pleased with design and performance. Nicely executed.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Haven't played very long but it's ok.. trying to figure everything out but it's an ok review so far. I will keep trying it to see.then I'll do another review
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I do think things went a little bit crazy towards the end. It was like the writer got tired of writing a good story and couldn't come up with a better ending.
B006LSZECO|2.0|but I thought it to be dark and did not enjoy it very much.  Finished it because we chose it for our monthly bookclub read.  Most in bookclub did not enjoy it.  &#34;F&#34; word way over used!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|When I first began to use this app, it was fine. Now for some reason I am unable to open downloads.
B00C2VIA52|2.0|PLEASE FIX YOUR SERVERS FOR A GREAT GAME AND PERFECT SCORE!!!!<br />Battling against others suck when your server can't handle the load.  I keep looking battles because I'm dropped and I can assure you my internet connection is excellent!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It was helpful to see Season3 since I missed it on TV., Looking forward to Season 4 in January, 2014
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A perfectly portrayed splice of a life. Pure, open, heartfelt, and masterfully poignant. A gift to the reader of how to appreciate our journey as Harold learns to appreciate his.
0345529057|4.0|A GOOD STORY WHICH I ENJOYED I REALY GOT IN TO THE STORY,WHEN IT STOPED HALF WAY THROUGH.  TRYED TO COTINUE THE STORY BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTES OT BOOKS BUT NOT THE CONTINUING STORY.  SO I HAVE NOW LOST INTEREST.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This was a really fun game that I enjoyed. Some levels were quite easy but most were engaging enough to keep things interesting, but not irritating. Good game! Of course I really like Noodlecake games. :)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app will have you nodding off to sleep in no time! If you have trouble sleeping, I can't imagine a better way short of narcotics to put you out. If I meditated, this would be the sort of thing I would listen to. VERY nice. I set it on crickets and soft classical music, set the built-in timer for 30 minutes, and go to sleep.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Interesting format but the same words are used over and over. Got boring pretty quick. Not one I would keep on my Kindle Fire.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I played this game once and it was a lot of fun. Good graphics. But since then it has crashed right after loading over and over. It is not my connection... restarted my device... redownloaded the game, still crashes. Now all of my gameloft games are doing this and nothing else. Please fix.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|umm.... what did i just watch?? this was by far one of the dumbest movies that i have ever seen along with movies produced by M. Night Shyamalan. what are producers producing? nothing but ....
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent entertainment. Really interesting to watch the family moving through time. Wonderful acting, great costumes, can't wait for season four
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Easy to use, multifunctional, customizable.  It is as it says on the tin.  Using Nexus 7.<br /><br />It also does binaural beats, odd, but pleasantly so.
B009MYARIK|4.0|If you are looking for a fun summer read, this is it. I have to add more words so read it
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my four year old cannot put it down Nd neither can I.  we both have a kindle fire Nd we compete. it is awesome
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I love this album from beginning to end, every song has its own flavor. Everything sounds sharp, the tempo in every song set up a nice cadence that is not repetitive & allow each song to exist on it own. In other words it does not sound repetitive. The songs have a great balance between heavy rifts & metal harmonies, Dave voice have a nice melodic raspy edge tone that adds to the experience. Do yourself a favor and get the album.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think this is a very good app. Its a very useful tool in letting you know the rate of usage, and charging time to full charge.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is an excellent movie-I watched it several times! The action, the plot and the acting-all are superb. I really like this story and the characters in the movie. Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its cool..more options for building the game will be nice. I just started, im hoping it gets better. Once upon a time this review was required to get some permits that are required to play the game.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Another phoned in performance by Tom Cruise. Sometimes I wonder just how long he can live off of his popularity because his acting is so monotone - each character is the same just change the name.<br /><br />This movie has Tom playing Jack Reacher a ex military cop who doesn't care about laws he only cares about getting rid of the bad guys. At least he doesn't have a love interest, all he has to do is hit people/ or shoot people, in other words the same old, same old.
0671646788|5.0|The book expresses and shows examples of certain cases and people who lives are so much different do to their thinking. I say everyone should get this book if you want to expand your horizon into a better quality of life. It's not who you are that makes up your life, it's how you think is the main point of the book. Which is so true!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series, enjoyed this and Season 1 and 2, Amazon beats all other prices such as Fye and Newbury!  Looking forward to Season 4!
B005JE1KHE|3.0|Pretty tedious, too slow, can't understand the logic behind (even in imaginary world should be some healthy logic), seems like withholding events & information to be able to sell more books.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  My wife says that she never likes to see a movie more then once, but will watch this one again and again
B00CW665VI|4.0|Emma Chase is destined to give Alice Clayton a run for her money.  I love that it's from a male perspective and the delivery was laugh out loud good.  Drew hoping for a peek of Belle's (Beauty and the Beast) cleavage still gives me a chuckle.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I'm a movie buff, so I had to watch it and it was kinda entertaining. But overall nothing like the original and he didn't even really seem like a barbarian. More like a Pirate.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I love it love it.  Very real.  Nice to see about different illnesses.  And that two people can get thru it and to see chris tucker was awesome...
B00338QENI|5.0|In light of the recent SCOTUS ruling on the patentability of human genes, it is worth our while for all of us to understand more about the legal and ethical implications involved in the tissue samples we routinely give to doctors.  Loved the way this book uses an actual case to frame the argument!
B004DHUAZQ|2.0|its and ok movie nice to see the old timers all together.. I dont know if i would watch it again
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|not what I expected, but a good movie, a little slow in the beginning. good special effects, and graphics. not too long
B00C7DGRL4|1.0|Graphics show clear line from set to cgi. Storyline was really predictable and no unexpected buildup. Acting was transparent. All around disappointed. Surprised by reviews.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Alot of people think this is a amazing rock album like me, and others just think it's just another grunge album. But the pumpkins are so much more than another grunge band, their one of the most creative and amazing rock bands of all time my opinion of course. I think this album is the pinnacle of all their albums. Sounding more like classic rock and metal think ( led zeppelin, black sabbath, queen, UFO, judas priest) mixed with early eighties goth rock ( the cure, the smiths, my bloody valentine) while mixing elements of alternative rock that was new and refreshing at the time think( James addiction, soundgarden, nirvana) and turning into something more and new. There a little but of everything in this album for everyone the loud fuzzy guitars on most songs to the soft acoustic ballads on others, to the light and heavy shades on others, bringing in different elements from all genres of music making something new and creative. Great album for any rock, metal, or just a music fan great album to add in your collection.
0767817729|5.0|If you love dramatic romance this will move you~i purchased this movie to add to my collection~It is a great story line and i woudl recomend watching this is you find Keven Costner as handsome as i did in this film~it also has action scense as well very moving plot.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|It is a beautiful, useful, and perfect case. The material is good, the IPhone 5 fits perfectly. I do really recommend it!
B000050FEN|5.0|Saw this years ago & wanted to add it to my collection its morgan freeman & brad pit~So that alone screams volume~this is a crime thriller that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat&#62;
B001RNO7C6|5.0|Good looking shoe that's also comfortable and sturdy. Good to find a stylish shoe that's also waterproof. I highly recommend.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. Hands down, bingo blitz is best bingo game out there!!I absolutely can't get enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the book very much. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. Recommend this series of books.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Have not finish it, but what I have read I like  I really like reading Stephen King's books(been reading his books for many years).
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it more and more everytime I play it . I would recommend it for those who are bored time will pass.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I like that King's writing makes me feeling like I am there in the middle of the book. Good read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Wonderful alarm clear loud it makes sure the job gets done because it works like a charm. Does everything it says that it will. Love it so much
1573226521|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, extraordinaire. THE BEACH is a superb novel about the search for meaning through travel, longing and the failures of the human heart. It has a slow, almost rocking pace, that will lull you into a false sense of comfort. It's been often compared to LORD OF THE FLIES, but think about it more as a HEART OF DARKNESS, sponsored by an American Airlines.<br /><br />Loved THE BEACH for its predatory, deliberate way of examining mediocrity through the extraordinaire and its amazing insight into the dynamics of human interaction. While it is a beautiful, visual novel that might give you the travel bug, it'll also make you think twice the idea of \\"settling\\" and to stop thriving, even in a secret paradise you have all for yourself.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Part allegory, part voyeurism, this is a unique view into the opaque world of totalitarianism. It reads better than Solzhenitsyn because of its obvious concern for society as well as the protagonist. Brilliant writing.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love it! Can't seem to put it down once I start playing it, very challenging.<br />Don't get much else done if I get into it!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This a really great app and fun to play around with. I would recommend this to anyone. It's also at a really good price considering all the great effects it has.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|this is one movie that you will really enjoy..my husband thought it was one of the best television series that he has see in a very long time..get it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app! Works great on my phone &amp; I even use this version on my tablet because I like having the arrow keys (which the tablet version doesn't have). I also like the option to add different languages. All around fabulous.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game because if people were addicted to slot machines then with this you don't have to pay with money so it is fun and can help with gambling issues
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The author does an excellent job developing the characters and their relationships.  You get the sense that you really know them but she holds back just enough to keep you wondering.  Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  Great book for any age group.  Really easy read!  Can't wait to read book 2.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Complex, connected and alive. Once more Hosseini takes the reader on a journey into a rich culture unknown to most Westeners.  Thank you.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game but when you buy land the time frame for use is too long need to have more weapons to use surface to air missile defence
B001BANK32|5.0|I am not a great Stephen King fan, but have read some of his books. Having seen the movie a few times, I wanted to read the book. I did the same with the Dead Zone. As usual, the movie was great, but the book was that much better. The characters are much better developed and the plot is different enough that I didn't know exactly what was coming next. Very gripping read. I read everything from Science fiction to non-fiction to suspense and technical works so a story really has to hold me for me to continue reading a book. This one did not disappoint in that respect.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Thanks for a great game.  As another player said it reminded me of the mist series.  The whole world of gamers are not all shooters.  I often wondered why there were so many killing games.  My theory is that we are in a time of turmoil and the killing games reflect this real world phenomena.  After the mist series there was nothing to play in that type of venue. So please more of &quot;The Room&quot;.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|That's about all I have to say about this game. The variety of missles (birds) does make it interesting, though.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Hansel and Gretal was a dark, wild romp of a fairytale.  I liked how the dark  witches were more classic in style, with cackles of evil and enchanted brooms!  The costumes and make up were also very nice, making the witches suitably evil.  I did think the weapons were mighty inventive but somehow, their contrivances felt \\"familiar\\".  The story wasn't at all deep or meaningful;  for what they were trying to do it didn't have to be, nor was I expecting as such...In the end it wasn't something I'd let my little ones see what with all the cussin', but as far as being entertaining, well, Hansel and Gretal did its job.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play everyday its really fun and addictive. there's a lot of rooms to explore and plenty of quest to do.
B007SUW24W|5.0|This is a wonderful singer with  mind provoking lyrics and he has a  way of drawing you into his music. Great artist and look forward to more of his music.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This is a great app it's wonderful I have been using this app since I got the kindle it's perfect for looking at videos and for downloading them onto mp3 I'm not going to lie it sometimes has problems but it's still a good app you just have to know how yo use it
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I ordered this but it will not open and play.Very disappointing.Maybe y'all can fix this issues or refund my money.I ordered a second time and finally got it to download and play.Very disappointed with the content.Watched maybe five minutes.Very bad!Who would let a favorite childhood teddy bear get high?I turned it off after 5 minutes or so.Very bad,not funny.I want a refund for not only the 1st attempt but the one that did download and play.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|And didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Wish that there had been one less story line to develop the character story line better
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I don't suspect that any die-hard Killers fans would call this the band's best album,and I wouldn't either, but it's by no means a disappointment. In the first half of the album (tracks 2 through 7) we're treated to a slew of enjoyable, but unspectacular love songs; sonically clean, mainstream rock that's not as synth-y as \\"Hot Fuss\\" or \\"Day & Age,\\" and not as gritty as \\"Sam's Town,\\" and whose lyrics are the standard power-ballad fare. Around the middle, tracks 5 and 6, are a bit reminiscent of Brandon's \\"Flamingo.\\" The last half, roughly,(tracks 8 through 12) are a little more lyrically and musically adventurous. In my opinion, the album's real stand-out tracks are \\"Heart of a Girl,\\" \\"Be Still,\\" and \\"Battle Born,\\" which are all clustered near the end. The first two of those three are beautiful and otherworldly. The album's closer, \\"Battle Born,\\" is downright epic, certainly one of the heaviest, and best, tracks the Killers have given us so far. Its lyrics lament the decline of morality and patriotism in America.<br /><br />All-in-all, although it's really not as timeless as their previous work, I'd say \\"Battle Born\\" is still probably better than the vast majority of music that is being produced (and listened to and praised) these days. It's a shame that it quietly debuted, and then quickly slipped down the charts. For a committed Killers fan, it's definitely worth purchasing, but for the casual passerby, you'd be better off with \\"Hot Fuss\\" or \\"Day & Age.\\"
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Even though this is an excellent movie with great actors Some of the dates and years do not add up Mistakes in the storyline were made Which Liberace was in love with Sonya Henie  in 1977 but she died in 1969..the music is excellent ,the wardrobe is flashy over the top His Las Vegas home It was beautiful I also remember the palimony suit And the scandal that was made of it The movie shows a realistic lifestyle of two gay men At times you feel like you're actually there living it with them Hats off to HBO for having The good sense to bring us such a powerful movie That really could not be told until today ..
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I always enjoy these novels.  I don't have to think.  I sinmply enjoy the plot.  I still need five words.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Just finished reading &#34;Insanely Simple&#34; by Ken Segall, then read The One Thing. The obsession of both Jobs and Keller is amazingly similar, focus is simplicity, and when compounded by hard work, is success.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|While the original stage recordings are better quality, this is also a fun version to own.  I've seen Les Mis twice on stage, and I loved the movie.  However, I think that the movie soundtrack is more powerful when you are actually watching the movie.  Without the context and the visual effects, the motion picture soundtrack loses some of its effect.<br /><br />That said, I loved the movie version and its interpretation.  I thought the music and the singing were beautiful.  I would recommend that anyone who enjoyed the movie and its rendition of the music should add this album to his or her library.  It's not as complete as some of the others, but being able to picture the faces when you hear their voices is a treat!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|My 4 children have not yet seen the Wizard of Oz and now after seeing this wonderful prequel they will Love the Wizard of Oz that much more. I grew up watching The Classic every year around the holidays when it was on television, this movie opens your eyes to before The Wizard of Oz and how the Oz became what he was ,not just some old silly guy behind the curtain.. This movie was Awesome and any negative reviews must be from people that don't appreciate everything that goes into writing a screenplay and all the work making the movie.<br />My family and I loved seeing this movie and we range in ages from 48 to 7. We loved understanding the witches and which witch was which !
B00002N9ER|4.0|I like these clips. They work great for my needs and I am very pleased with them. I would recommend.
193700788X|5.0|I enjoy the cover photo and content of Charlaine Harris Novels. Sookie Stackhouse is my favorite returning character. Charlaine rocks!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I was so interested in this book. It is a great children's and young readers book any adult and kid can read this book
B00915G6YE|5.0|Well written, acted, and produced. Easily one of the best shows on television, and easily one of the most riveting seasons.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book, lots of loose ends, can hardly wait for the next book to see how Martin ties them together!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I watched 'Les Mis' as a video rental. There were several people present, and very few of the guests were able to adequately discern the lyrics of many songs. One of the guests was quite familiar with the score, and even she admitted that some of the deeper implications of the script didn't come through as clearly as it might have in a theatre.<br />  The show was brilliantly photographed. I would recommend this be viewed on a system with a surround sound capability.<br />  As it is I will probably purchase the sound track to review the parts I missed.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Been waiting 35 years for this album that features the original vocalist OZZY. It's the best album I've ever heard. Loved it. If your a true sabbath fan, I'd reccomand it for anyone. Job well done guys.<br />\m/(>.<)\m/
B004498KPU|5.0|I paid $18 for all of his videos on one DVD. This was a great purchase, I recommend it to MJ fans.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|VERY well written and deeply perceptive....One of the best books I have read this year.  Thoughtful, written with excellent care, not an easy subject,  I would recommend this to anyone over perhaps fifteen.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|A very insightful commentary on the history of marriage throughout time and across culture, and how the research of this subject guided the author to a comfort level within which she could marry that Brazilian guy from &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34;.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Woohoo I liked it although the epilogue was the best part. Although I will read it again once the whole series is written.
0143039431|5.0|)<br />An incredibly powerful work; it took me a couple of chapters to like it at all, but soon I was hooked.<br />Young Tom Joad has just been released from prison but returns to his home in Oklahoma to find his family and many others) packing up to leave their sharecropping lifestyle - new tractors have made them surplus to requirements. They head off in an old jalopy to the 'promised land' of California, where fruit picking jobs have been advertised...<br />Although we simply observe the characters' actions and conversation - Steinbeck never tells you their thoughts - they soon become incredibly vivid: Pa and Ma, the grandparents, Tom and younger siblings Al (whose life revolves around cars and girls); self-centred pregnant sister Rose of Sharon; and the 'little fellas', Ruthie and Winfield.<br />As they travel they strike up close relationships with other families in the same plight, and Steinbeck's thoughts on the benefits of unions and socialism to the working man are illustrated.<br />Recommended.
0345803485|4.0|Heard so much; had to get this book.  Was fast paced enough to finish quickly although skimmed the over-the-top repetitive steamy scenes.  Fast delivery from Amazon.  Satisfied purchase.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Too slow paced.  Too much descriptions<br />Don't waste your money on this book story good but not written well at all
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Kind of lame wish there were internet without wireless connection to go on Google or youtube.  DO we need WiFi?
1432794426|5.0|This is the most complete information about our beloved Michael Jackson ever written. The way Karen Moriaty describes with precise points of view of his life as an entertainer, as a father, his heart of gold and full of feelings for the children around the world.<br /><br />To read what Michael Jackson went through happiness and  kindness, worries and sadness like a rollercoaster and became THE KING OF POP where there will never be someone like him, not in this century or the next.<br /><br />I truly recommend this book for those who don't have a full view of who was really Michael Jackson, his simplicity and complex life being always humble among his fans but grand on stage. Unique in his dance and  music where he was the best in history.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this if anyone of you have ever played&quot;roblox&quot; it's just like this but better but this is good too
B00ALKPTFA|3.0|This is an interesting story. For me I've read many self help books and there was no new information here, but it was packaged in a user friendly way. In parts it was a little long winded and tended to repeat the same points. It could have been shorter.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Daft Punk have created a doffetent sound for this album and the album is superb. The sound of this vinyl is fantastic. You will not be disappointed at all.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Ended up paying 5 bucks a movie, all came in one sturdy case. I have no need for all of the extra special features, just some good old Harry P movies.
B002TLSSXO|3.0|They look great in the picture but the box I received was poor quality. I ended up going to my local specialty cooking store to buy them individually. They look a lot better since I could see them in person.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It helped me much with my scientific work, when I needed to write the review. It was so quick and comfortable to browse my saved articles and to make small notes on it. And the most useful - different sorting order. Adore this app
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A great story, well written, and a pleasure to read and enjoy.  It is clear why it has stood the test of time
B0083V2WBS|5.0|What I best like about this is how varied it is, I love too the musicians, the singers the atmophers it shows.<br />Hugh Laurie's voice is so fabulous.
0802473156|5.0|I wish I knew some 30 years ago what I have just learnt from the book. However, it is never too late.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My only regret is that there are so few shows each season. I can not get enough of Downton Abbey. Every character is vital.
B007HJ84ZK|2.0|I realize that sex sells, but this entire episode was about nothing more than women are sex objects. They are naked, scantily clothed, or having sex. Wher'd the story go ? it's just too bad. I am sure you will love this if you are a man. Krystal Jonas
B002SF9YYI|5.0|Fantastic quality of sound and the videos... one of the best collections of BF, all in a classic small CD case!
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|After two rather interesting and entertaining movies...how did Will Smith get coerced into doing this pathetic role?  Fell asleep watching it...which was sad because I was trying to stay awake while snapping green beans.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|What a fabulous album!! I highly recommend the deluxe version over the normal release. I just think these guys are a great band, great writing and wonderful music and beats to go along with it. Not to mention I hear they're super nice.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S AWESOME I LOVE IT YEAH YOU HEARD ME I LOVE THIS GAME DID YOU HEAR ME I SAID IT'S AWESOME
B00915G6YE|5.0|Amazing season. If you love the show there will be some cool surprises from the past. Best season since season 4. Definitely one of the top shows in television.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so sad to read the final page of Wool, Silo Saga.<br /><br />This author is imaginative, but plausible.  Can't wait to read more of his work!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm a major fan of Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen are favorites! This version of Pride & Prejudice is very entertaining. The music is also very nice! I give it a &#34;thumbs up&#34;!
B005NS0VNU|5.0|Loved it.  It was bought for my son, and he was so excited to receive it. He plays it in his car.
0780020685|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband. He put it on his Christmas list one year. We've seen a number of Mr. Kurasawa's work. We do recommend this DVD.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love the game... fun. Relaxing game...I love puzzles so perfect game for me... keeps your mind busy which works for me.... I would recommend this game for anyone who loves puzzles..
B001N3GUIE|4.0|This movie and others of the same genre were such a part of my childhood I just love revisiting them and sharing with friends.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Very intuitive and easy to use.<br />It has a nice left-hand navigation-easy to see how far behind I am in my reading!
B009VIZDLI|3.0|A light and engaging enough read.  The main character was fairly one dimensional and the plot pretty predictable but was written well enough to get away with it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written for a book but I could not not do one. This book is amazing!!!!! Drew made me fall in love with him from the start. He has a great sense of humor that will have you laughing out loud more than once. I can't wait for another book from Emma Chase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be one of the best games ive downloaded its fun and always intertaining I love it and I bet u will also.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was counting the days for the release of this book and I can honestly say that I'm really disappointed with the results. Eva and Gideon lost something in this book and I just can't quite figure out what it was. I truly only enjoyed the last 3 chapters. I hope Sylvia Day gets her mojo back for the next book in the series.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I think it is neat and you should try it and rate it for yourself. Some times I don&quot;t like how the food is gone so quickly.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|it is not an easy game to play on a kindle.  the screen is too small.  works much better on a pc
B001G2B5HI|5.0|My sons mother had this book as a kid and I love reading it to him! This book was a buy!
B008220BLG|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  Mundane plot, no character development, and a arbitrary use of zombie rules.  All of the sudden zombies can feel emotion and start to talk?  I think not.  Please pass on this film.  We turned it off half way through.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its my favorite card game when no one is around and you want to play.. this is a great choice!
B002N2LEVM|3.0|This is Season one, repeated, with lead character a little less coma-like.  Here's an suggestion for &#34;next time&#34;:  a bit less gratuitous sex and violence and a little more character development and plot.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I loved this game it is very addictive. I played for hours before I stopped it has flood graphics never slowed or froze and overall was a good game.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|As a prequel to a classic the expectations for this movie were high.  The actors were fun to watch and the story of the witches is compelling.  I suppose it doesn't hurt that I have a soft spot for scoundrels.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is an game that u can play with out wifi this game is cool creative its the game to play against some one its really cool
B007FG9LIE|5.0|You never know where this story line will take you.  Just when you think you know what is going to happen-you are pulled in deeper.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I can't live without it. I depend on it before using anything in Kindle. It helps me to know it is recharging. Savior
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Language was awful. The over use of the F word made this movie unbearable to watch.<br />Wish we could get a refund or credit.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|got a 7.3 on the Windows experience. play every game i throw at it. Recommend this over an i5. Use that extra money for a graphics card
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Enjoying. N loving it<br /><br />Excellent good neat good<br />Good app to play n u can time pass<br /><br />Good game to download
B001IZIDHI|5.0|Excellent CD. Very relaxing and what a beautiful singer! I don't know how I missed this album and waited so long to get it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is, by far, the BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. I would recommend this book to people ages 9-12 or anyone who is interested in Greek mythology
B004SIP9U6|4.0|Still one of my favorite movies. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. Only internal button for CD was broken and it rolls around in the case.
B007WOA1IS|3.0|Links to Google maps, vendor site, etc are great. Used this book heavily in my recent 5-day stay in London. Wish there are more sections on day-trip excursions from London like Stonehenge and Cambridge. Map resolution is low. You don't always have data link to see Google map.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Backatown is packed with energizing music, I never get tired of this!  Troy Andrews at his best with Orleans Avenue.  If you haven't heard him yet, don't miss out he is a superb musician along with this fabulous band!  A must see in person also, you won't be sitting in your seat for one second!
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Because of the end I was left hoping that his next book will be a continuation of the story of the Clifton family.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|This book was very good in several ways. Just as an adventure story, it is excellent. But it also takes us deeply into the author's life and history.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is quite Fantatastic. It is nice to just surf the streets of different countries and do awesome tricks. Keep the good work up
B0016PM722|5.0|The shipping was fast...it arrived in 5 days (from the US to Malaysia!). The packaging was HUGE! MASSIVE! Extremely lengthy.<br />Anyways upon opening, there was little to do but remove the stickers and turn on the lightsaber and start playing around. Its much better than my Ultimate FX lightsabers for sure (for one, you can't see the mini LED's, the hilt is made of metal, its much more longer and the sound is more realistic). And its bright. I preferred the non-attached one because it uses AA batteries rather than the smaller AAA ones hence the blade is much brighter compared with the newer Force FX lightsabers (and its also more cheaper). I've used it to hit other objects and the other lightsaber, so far alright (but don't hit too hard of course). All in all a very satisfied Jedi (or Sith) here.
B00BV9S01U|5.0|If you are looking for the Whitesnake of hairspray and Spandex, this set is not for you.  If you became aware of them before that, when they wore denim and were a regular-though-very-talented, straight ahead bluesy, rock n' roll, band, you'll love this set.  I heartily recommend this package as long as you know what to expect.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Brought it for my brother for Christmas, and he loves it. We all sat down to watch the third one in all of its Blu-Ray glory.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Engaging and very entertaining series that explores what happens to people caught up in the larger events of their times. Well acted by very attractive actors.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game! The story line is excellent and the search for clues and puzzles are great! Well worth the 2.99! Wish it was just a longer game!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The songs on this album remind me of some of the great Blues inspired Rock and Roll of the 60s and 70s.  They do it almost as well as anyone has before them.  The Blues infused hard driving Rock and Roll is timeless when done well and this album does it very well.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just purchased and have played several levels. So far it's a lot of fun. Loving it. The classic level is easy to play.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A different time, yet familiar earth. After a while it will be difficult to imagine that the main character is a child. A good read especially if interested in the upcoming movie.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Meh. Wasn't horrible. A little much on the nose-to-nose, whip it out and we'll see whose is bigger, kinda stuff at times...it would never be confused with smart viewing, but watching it didn't kill me. Which is probably a win, of sorts.<br /><br />-AnnaLovesBooks
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Another incredible masterpiece from the great genius of modern Prog-<br />rock.  SW Soars on extended tracks like LUMINOL, THE HOLY DRINKER,<br />and WATCHMAKER.  Creepy stuff... especially when you read the stories<br />that go along with the tunes.  THE TITLE TRACK is performed with sincerity<br />and conviction-  a hauntingly beautiful and movingly dark ballad.<br />A good song to mourn by -  DON'T MISS THIS ALBUM !!
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I hate to give this a &quot;3&quot;, but the positives and negatives on this game are equal. Storyline: I liked that it had a native American twist and instead of the usual &quot; I have to save my wife/kid/grandparent&quot; it was a quartet of women doing the saving. On the other hand the rest of the story was predictable and somewhat boring.<br />Gameplay: everything worked fine, no double tapping or glitches, but there wasn't much to do except look for a few objects in each scene that were easy to find. Only three HO scenes, a few puzzles and the rest was &quot;find and solve&quot;.<br />Overall: graphics ok, story ok, puzzles ok, length ok, cost too much at $4/5.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Everyone had been recommending this series to me for a while. I picked it up and I found it enjoyable.
B000FGGE5Y|1.0|Movie looked like it was copied from beta. Very distorted and fuzzy.Everyone sounded muffled. Case was in bad shape and disc was dirty
1572814136|5.0|These are sturdy, vivid cards. In fact, better than the original Rider-Waite out there. The item was received expediently (to my surprise - I received item quickly.)
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|The game was cool, with great graphics and an interesting storyline, but the hidden object puzzles got REALLY old very quickly. I've been buying games from big fish for a while now, and tried a few of them but just don't care for it. I've never understood the fascination with that genre, it's monotonous and just gives me a headache staring at one screen for so long.the other puzzles that were included were interesting,but the controls were really delicate and requires several attempts to get the cursor to respond correctly.  In all, the story kept me playing,but the  I just got more and more frustrated every time I saw another room  full of junk I had to look through. Unless you are a fan of HO games generally, I'd recommend skipping this one.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Not as fasted paced as I usually like until the very end but still a good read with good character devo
B0053O8ARI|5.0|I purchased season one on blu ray because I'm a fan of the show. The video and audio quality are brilliant. Many of the shows writers, consultants, producers used to work on the \\"WIll and Grace\\" show, so it's no secret were this show gets it's wit and humor from. The blu ray packaging offers a \\"freebie\\" in the form of digital copies of the entire season through the often loathed and hatred of \\"Ultraviolet\\" and it's sister or partner company \\"Flikster\\". I have never been a fan of either and never will be. I refuse to let these companies dictate when, where, if and how I can watch my content. That being said I decided to suppress my usual vomit inducing tendencies when either of the aforementioned names are uttered, and proceeded to activate the code on Flikster's web site to gain access to season one. My intent was to watch  the series using the free Flikster app available for use on apple's iPad and phone. if you do this you will be wasting your time people. The series is not available, and there is no eta as to when it will be available. You are then directed to click on the picture icon of the series once in the app, to direct you to others sources to view the series. You are then redirected back to ultraviolet's web site which doesn't have an available app to watch on apple products either. Seriously?!?!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the rope time travel HD rules. I can't wait for there to be another age. It will be so......
B008XX6J4C|5.0|First discovered them on you tube. Their music is a mix of jazz, classical and modern  standards.This cd is worth listening to over and over. Great study music.
1476734941|5.0|We bought it! We are doing it!  It is simple!  The book is well written! The sample meals and examples and food lists and portions are easy to follow (100 grams equates we figured out to about 1 cup - that was the only &#34;challenge&#34; as we are not Brits) and it is fun to do and not hard at all.  The we of us is husband and wife....and we enjoy &#34;planning&#34; the &#34;fast&#34; days menu and look forward to those days amazingly!  We feel better on the FAST DAYS than we do on the &#34;other&#34; days.  LOL!  It is a great book and well work the few coins for purchase.  It has changed our eating habits for the better as well as our cholesterol and blood pressure and glucose levels!  That kind of says it all.  BTW, we are senior citizens....if we benefited from this book, you can, too!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|their second  cd is just as good as their first. This is perfect back ground music. Very impressed how they can make a modern song classical like.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Overall a pretty good album.  A couple of songs are wonderful, but some are eh.  Still a great listen!  GAGA!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael buble latest is more standards of singers of the past . if you like standards music with a little swing ,then buy this cd
B00005OAE6|3.0|depends on your taste in songs, I ended up only liking 2 of the songs, but play the heck out of them.good price.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|If you surf the net, this program is a must. It blocks all the ads and even in programs. I recommend it! --Christopher
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good graphics and a decent plot. Clues were just right. The mini games were great and not so hard that they had to be skipped just get through the scene. it was sort of hard for me to take breaks because I kept wanting to get that next clue!! Great job!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun little room escape game. Clues are easy to find, sometimes too easy, but still challenging. Clear graphics and has good navigation.
3836538725|5.0|The images in Genesis are typically outstanding - but more to the point, they have been created with purpose and passion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game rocks. I play it all the time.it would just need a bit more stuff that's exclusive to the game.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|I've been a Jackson 5 fan all my life and Michael Jackson still reigns as King of Pop.  I first heard In the Closet when I saw the video on VH1 and loved it then.  When I saw it was available on kindle, I thought \\"about time.\\"  A classic Michael song.  Perfection.  I only wish I could have downloaded the video to it as well.  Hey now, kindle, there's an idea!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I've been a Trekkie since William Shatner first showed his handsome face on my parents TV in the 60's. The only captain who comes close is Patrick Stewart's Picard, & this movie shows off his superb thespian skill.  Great movie & love the Borg leader being placed into her body...that scene always gives me goosebumps!  Jonathan Frakes is truly a Trekkie's director & when he shows up on the screen with his megawatt smile you know he's loving every minute!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I love all of Tom Clancy's work. This is  just another of his great action packed novels. Intrigue and realism. Love it!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I would recommend it to a mature person with an interest in psychology and thriller reading.  It was my first Harry Hole novel and I enjoyed it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it's a very good game and my brother has it. but it would be better if you could be on the ground.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great continuation of the story of Eva and Gideon. I look forward to reading about more of their journey together.
0807014273|5.0|A five star rating is true ratingfor a life changing book.  Deep thought,  Deep reaching.  Deep truth.  I sent the book to a friend who has been in prison for many years in an effort to help him free up his thinking.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|Its been some time since I last watched this awesome movie and it was better than ever thanks to the HD format. This brings back a lot of memories, being on the road with the wind in my face and the sun on my back... \\"Just A Willow In The Wind\\".  Doc
B006L9B6TI|5.0|If you have read The Secret and The Power, The Magic is a practical application of the principles of the two ... a natural progression.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I could not even open the program on my Kindle Fire HD. The program tries to open, ask if I want to provide feedback and crashes.
B00CNL2TIU|5.0|i was hoping to find same old, watered down knowledge that self-help books known to provide from this book but it proved me wrong. right now, this is the single most beneficial book in my life. thanks Darren for writing a practical self-help book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought it was well written. Kept me turning the page, wanting to know what happened next; suspenseful. Sad that it's over.
1442346949|5.0|took a while to finish the whole audiobook. i listen to audiobooks or podcasts while i am working. i am glad this book covered all the things i wanted to know about Steve Jobs and the narration was beautiful.
B004NS710C|4.0|Movie shows how one stupid person can do alot of damage. It also shows that 2 devoted people were willing to give their lives to save many.
B004GYY714|4.0|Tunein Radio is easy to use and lets me listen to my favorite stations when I'm not in the car or at home.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|A friend brought this over to play with; within 5 minutes everyone knew the rules and were playing.  Great portable game that's easy to pick up on, quick to play, and there's even some simple expansion dice you can buy and add in with minimal fuss.  Good mixture of luck and quick decision making.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app I have installed in my kindle fire. I would highly recomend it to everyone. Buy now
0307592731|5.0|I can't believe the woman made it past the first mile, much less the entire trip.  Very well written, very engaging.  The only negative is that I was disappointed that she didn't cover the John Muir Trail where I've done most of my hiking.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun but challenging. The music is very relaxing. More than worth the app price, this game is great for anyone who enjoys challenging puzzles. Try it and you'll love it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. In fact I'd put it in my top 3 favorite game apps.<br /><br />While the game initially costs ¢99, the sales model allows you to spend money and unlock other features. I dont believe this is really necessary as many of the features that you can unlock with cash can also be unlocked by progressing through the game.<br /><br />That being said, it took me quite a few tries to beat the game the first time just to unlock the second plague type. Despite that, I had a blast playing the game over and over and I think that is the greatest strength of this game, replay value. Its also pretty fun to simulate the demise of our species. Call me a misanthrope.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Calm music with sometimes challenging puzzles. Makes you think without stressing you out. Love it!<br />Anyone who enjoys puzzles will enjoy this game. More than worth the price.
B0089PWU2E|5.0|I LIKE AND RESPECT THE MUSIC OF BUDDY HOLLY, HE WAS GREAT. I DISLIKE NOTHING ABOUT THIS CD SET, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL
B008476HBM|3.0|After starting this book, I realised that I had read it years before, so didn't proceed with it.  I don't like reading books a second time.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|Sometimes it freezes but other than that I think its the best working fb  app out there especially when priced for free.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I play both visitor and facebook. Gives me something to fill in time.  I like to read chats from all over. Sometimes there are  glitches but has been running smooth here lately.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|My granddaughter and I had a blast with the original version of this brain teaser.  We played Quell so often that we began memorizing the solutions to the different mazes.  So happy they developed a new set of puzzles.  This is a wonderful, relaxing way to exercise your brain !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow!!!! This the 3rd book just keeps getting better and better.  I'm super excited to know that more of this love affair is coming. I highly recommend this book.  Do NOT pay any attention to the negative reviews. This book is EXCELLENT and a MUST read.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|the soundtrack is fun and upbeat- just what i was hoping for and and all the song i wanted on there
B00D8RYV52|1.0|My son loves these games. It worked the first now doesn't work at all. It freezes on the main screen or force shuts the game. My son is very upset that he can not play his new game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Intriguing, very good. I liked it because it was thrilling to read. I hope all the  people read this book.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is the latest offering from Stephen King to give the Hard Case Crime imprint the benefit of the King name and a King original. The tone of the novel doesn't match the hardened noir and pulp fiction of the publisher's other offerings, as this reader did what was intended and bought several other books from Hard Case after reading Joyland, but it is classic King and does have a bit of a crime story.<br /><br />Joyland is a bildungsroman written from the point of view of the older man and it is elegiac in tone and intent and is in fact a beautiful story.  The reader follows a young man through his first broken heart, a summer job at an amusement park and not only his sexual initiation, but his initiation into some of the more somber realities of life. As we all do, the narrator both cringes at the callowness of youth and longs for it....not for its own sake, as youth is harder than many remember, but for the chance to do things over with the wisdom of experience. It is a universal wish and to my knowledge, none of us has yet managed it either for ourselves or in advising those that come after us. We all make our list of joys and regrets at the time we are most ignorant and impulsive and then live with them forever after.<br /><br />That musing is what makes Joyland so powerful and so poignant. King is a master of his craft so the story and the characters are well written and well drawn, but as other reviewers have noted, there is nothing particularly revolutionary in them; here they are very much in service to the theme of youth and regret and memory. This reader was moved by King's reflections on these themes and Joyland is more than worth reading.<br /><br />Hard Case Crime is worth checking out for readers with a taste for noir and pulp as well. All in all a great purchase.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it helped so much. it was totally worth getting I dint have to pay for it because it was free but it was really awesome and effective.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|This show is written impeccably. It's witty and unpredictable, and the actors are smoking hot!! It is definitely one of my new favorites.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is amazing and is worth every penny , and the DLC is really good also. This is the best game I have on the kindel.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Really enjoying this simple game of strategy with our son.  Some friends introduced us to it and we HAD to jump on Amazon and get it for his birthday a few weeks ago.  Simple to play, games are pretty quick, and its fun - what more could you ask for?!  Well-constructed and game-play is straightforward and easy for young ones as well.  Recommended as an \\"antidote\\" to video games and for restoring some family time.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I just don't care for this and removed it from my Kindle fire.  It doesn't make any sense. not good for me
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R R Martin takes all we learned in school about how to write a story and turns it upside down. This is the saga of a world that, although magical and fantastic, represents reality in its chilling truths.  Martin takes us to Westeros and Essos, where endings aren't always happy, where good doesn't eventually always triumph, and where the good guy doesn't always win. It is impossible to predict any plot's path, only to hang on for the thrilling ride! Stay warm as you read....for remember, winter is coming!
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|This book is a fun read although it's a little frustrating until close to the end. A bit unrealistic and fairy tale like
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its ok its just that everything is too high in prices and the special things you need to unlock people alyou need to get at least 50 of them its just rediculus.<br />So yeah its kinds stupid '!!!!!!
B000FA5STS|5.0|I found this book to have a great plot and character development - could not put it down- one of David Baldacci's best books
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ok at first  was not grabbed .  That was yesterday ! I.m not gonna go into techs .  Saw orignal  band 3 times as younger guy . First at 15 at Cal. Jamb  & rwice at Long Beach Area . This has alot of good stuff !  Get delux  13  !  If  old Sabbatht fan it will grow on you !!!  :)
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I liked this book a lot although there are other Baldacci books that I like better. They are all page turners
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun app to whie away a few idle minutes - takes a bit of thought and requires some thought.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|LOVE this app! I haven't used it with headphones as recommended, but I find it soothing and relaxing all the same. My favorite aspect is that you can play more than one sound simultaneously and it is very realistic
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|When I read the bad reviews I thought people were just mad because this wasn't the last book.  I was fine with that. But after reading it I wish I could get my time and money back. It really does seem like she's stretching the story out to make more money.  There was no point to this one really.  Shame on you Ms. Day. You could have done so much better.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was great. Once I got into the climax I couldn't stop reading. There were so many twist and turns. It was full of suspense and adventure. It was definitely a five-star book!!!
0887307280|5.0|Want to start a business? Must read it. It really helped me learn how to think when designing my chiropractic practice.
0671646788|5.0|This a must read for all inspiring entrepreneurs. It is a great follow-up to Think & Grow Rich. A must read!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It is so fun and I had a great time playing it! Challenging but not too difficult!  I adored all the characters and the graphics were better than I expected!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Like his other writing, it was interesting, and I really enjoyed world<br /> war z. Will read more when it comes
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Sharpens really fast and accurately.  Blade is very sharp after using so be careful.  Works for all different types of knives.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So when I first started Tangled, I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It's told from the point of view of a guy, and not just any guy, but a gorgeous, wealthy, arrogant jackass. However, I must say that it was surprisingly refreshing and raw. Drew Evans was an interesting character, and the book was pretty well written with just enough humor, not at all over done. I would definitely recommend.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I felt as though I was visiting the night circus and was part of the story. Beautiful imagery. I feel like a revure
B000VE439Y|5.0|I will watch this movie over and over, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. SO THERE
B008RTJQDI|5.0|This cd/dvd package totally satisfies.  I first heard this group on Nashville's (TN) independent radio station, &#34;Lighting 100&#34; 100.1 FM.  I was immediately taken by them and decided to get the album that had the single, &#34;Wolf,&#34; on it.  It came in perfect condition with a poster, a DVD, a booklet (lyrics, credits), and a guitar pick!  What we have here is a beautiful pair of sisters whose voices blend so well and who write amazing songs.
B000CRQX34|5.0|I will watch this movie over and over, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. SO THERE
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Excellent reboot of the classic series. Even if your not a \\"Trekkie\\" you will like this movie.  I gave it a well deserved 5 stars
0545123275|3.0|I'm still reading, I've kinda put it on the back burner and started reading other books. I like the concept but I feel like its a little dull when it has so much potential.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This was a funny movie, I thought it wouldn't be that funny but was surprised by how many times I laughed out loud
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Recommend this to anyone young or old feel like it has cleansing healing properties.<br /><br />Haven't bought a cd for ages was suggested this on a forum and very happy to have found it.
030758836X|4.0|It was a very good book.  The ending of the book was very ironic.  Overall I liked it and lent it to other people who liked it also.
B00C50NV2M|3.0|got 4 free pairs with tv piece that fits around your ear is lose on all 4 pairs if no careful well fall of face i contact amazon they are going to send me 4 more free so turned out ok
B005LAII94|5.0|While this one is definitely not for kids or the faint of heart, it is a very well acted and produced story of good guys gone bad. The characters come to life and keep you spell bound for the duration. Drugs were used as the catalyst for destruction here, but really, greed and corruption are the real villains . Something for everyone...eye candy, gore and violence mixed with an unusual but touching love story.
6305090564|5.0|Good action movie. It's got monsters,mercenaries & unexpected turns and comic relief through out the entire movie  not only that but a Bond girl in distress.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I could not stop watching this season and I can hardly wait to be able to watch season 3 on Amazon Prime.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Well, what can I say, this is quite the shocker as I did not have a clue there would be more. Can't wait for the next chapter!
B00881PTRC|4.0|Some of the animation might upset or confuse little kids a bit.  Generally, if you are trying, you will rarely get far enough in that you see those animations.  (There's nothing graphic, but sometimes you do actually see the hanging.)  The earlier ones are just funny.  It's well worth $.99.  Two player mode isn't what I thought it would be though - I thought we'd both work on the same puzzle generated by the computer, but we'd just be going back and forth.  That isn't it at all - one of us comes up with a puzzle for the other to solve.  Possibly that was well-explained in the app's description and I just missed it.  Enjoy!
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|was a little disappointed the vol.2 the &#34;Wrath of Kahn&#34; has a glitch in the middle of the movie, had to fast forward and miss half of the movie
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|First thing's first: this US Blu-Ray set is 100% NOT Region Free.<br /><br />MAD MAX is Region A locked, so do not buy this set if you don't own a multi-region or Region A compatible Blu-Ray player. MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR and MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME however, are both Region Free!<br /><br />Right, onto the films and the set itself.<br /><br />MAD MAX: The first movie is fantastic: a jaw-dropping action film like no other, made at a time without CGI, when stunt men and women really put their lives in danger, for our entertainment.<br /><br />The disc allows viewers to watch the film in the original Australian audio-track in a newly-created DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack or dual-mono if you prefer, or the horrifically awful US English Dub, (in dual-mono only) in which many of the characters are dubbed into American English. Not only does it sound terrible as a soundtrack, it's a pretty ropey dub. Considering all the dubbers had to do was translate Australian English into American English, it really shouldn't have been that hard. But boy, oh, boy, do the dubbers monumentally screw this up!<br /><br />Stick to the original Australian, and you won't go wrong. It's a meaty, beefy, loud and monsterous sounding 6.1 track, and the throng of the car and bike engines really feel like they're being revved in your living room! (Other audio track and subtitle options are available, including English Subs for the Deaf and Hard Of Hearing.)<br /><br />The picture looks very good, but I'm sure it could be improved, if someone was willing to give it the time and care it needed. I have no idea if the Blu-Ray 1080p print is taken from a 35mm Master Negative, or not, but whilst it looks clear and crisp, it probably could look even better. Still, you won't be too disappointed. The print is totally uncut, which is always a plus-point, including some of the slightly gorier moments that some countries removed or toned down. So if you've not seen it uncut, then this is a good reason to own this set.<br /><br />There's a 25-minute featurette, but I've not seen that yet, plus an audio commentary. Not exactly the best set of extras, but it's something. However, definitely a case of \\"must try harder\\"!<br /><br />MAD MAX 2: Also known as THE ROAD WARRIOR, improves on the original, in so many ways. A bigger, better, more souped-up version of the first, this is a film for petrol-heads and action-fans!<br /><br />Essentially, an action film, with minimal plot, but it's a stunner! Feel every single car crash, every bike smash, and every pounding thud, screech and squeal, as vehicles and people are trashed. There are too many great moments to single out, but the Gyrocopter scene is always a good one.<br /><br />Again, we have another newly-created for this set, DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack. The print is once again, uncut and uncensored, including some gory violence that was cut in some countries. The print used on the film is back to what it should be - namely MAD MAX 2, and not THE ROAD WARRIOR. Alas, the extras are the exact same ones on the old Warner's Blu-Ray release: one audio commentary, and a short intro from film critic Leonard Maltin. Fun, but not exactly great by any means. Where are the behind-the-scenes shots, or outtakes of the many incredible stunts? Disppointing, but forgiveable, purely because the film itself is so damn good. Sadly, the menu screen is cheap, and naff. A static shot, and a few icons at the bottom that let you play the film, select a chapter, play the trailer, or chose your audio and/or subtitle options.<br /><br />MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME: Definitely a disappointment after the high's of the first two films, this feels very much like a typical Hollywood \\"third wheel\\". It's an okay film, with an okay plot, and okay characters. It's decidedly very average. Gibson and Turner try their best, and whilst there are occasional moments of greatness, it's definitely not a winner, even if you take the film as a bog-standard action film, let alone as a MAD MAX movie.<br /><br />On this disc, you get a reasonable set of soundtracks and subtitle options, but it becomes clear very quickly, that no one at Warners was that bothered with this film. There are no extras, other than a 4:3 VHS-quality trailer. The menu screen is as static as they come, though it does tie-in to MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR. And you're left feeling like this was very much an unnecessary add-on to both the franchise, and this Blu-Ray box set too.<br /><br />Talking of which, the Steelbook case is more like a thin tin, rather than a true Steelbook Case. Essentially, a case, with a lid, printed all over, it looks nice, but it's not exactly outstanding by any means. It also feels thin, and a little on the cheap side of things. If you're ordering this, you may want to double-check your set arrives undented and unmarked.<br /><br />Inside the case, is a standard-sized Blu-Ray Amaray case, with a tray that holds the first two discs, and then the third disc goes inside in the usual position. The discs are dull: plain black with just the titles on, and a few other superfluous details, and the sleeve artwork is merely acceptable, though not great. Oh, and it's one of those horrible \\"recyclable\\" Amaray cases, with the tri-arrow recycling logo cut out of the front and back of the case. Not only does this mean the case is physically less strong, it offers less protection to the discs themselves, and there's the added potential that you can puncture the sleeve artwork, causing a nasty, irreparable tear. It smacks of cheapness. Companies need to stop using these cases immediately! I know they may be better for the environment, but on premium products like Blu-Ray's, they really do give the customer the view that you don't care if their purchase arrives damaged!<br /><br />So, overall, one great film, one truly superb film, and one distinctly underwhelming film, all wrapped-up in so-so extras, and an okay case. Most people willbe buying this set for the first two films, but it really does feel like this is a lot of money, for a set that's not really worth it's weight. I'm certain that once MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is unleashed onto the  public, there may well be a Quadrilogy set released, but don't bank on it containing many more extras for the first three films.<br /><br />Such a shame that Warners decided that MAD MAX fans weren't worth bothering with. Ultimately, a very disappointing set. Nice to own, but wait until the price comes down.<br /><br />ADDENUDUM: There are no forms of digital copies included. UK Region B fans should take a look at the UK Release due out on 12th August 2013 as shown at Amazon UK here...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mad-Max-Trilogy-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B00CP1ZRYQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top<br /><br />Be warned, though. The UK tin set, designed to look like a petrol/jerry can, is cheap looking, and cheaply made, and to be frank, is not even as nice to look at as the US Version.<br /><br />Price-wise, the US set is a £1 or two more expensive, when importing to the UK, but if I were a fan, I'd still buy the US Set! It's simply not as tacky as the UK version looks. However, if you can't play Region A Blu-Ray discs, then you have no choice, but to buy the forthcoming UK release.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Great movie. Classic from when I was younger. Love the performances by Ricci, Huston and Julia. Great to watch anytime.
B00123AYNM|5.0|I'm not quite sure what to compare this album to, it's sort of an alternative metal/progressive rock combination.  Anyways, I heard about this group when I was looking for bands similar to TOOL (you can't really compare the two groups together that well, except that they are both rather unique and difficult to describe).  But you should check them out, favorite song is Trains, search for it on youtube.  The whole album is great though.
B000VD5I94|3.0|I got the blue ray and on the plus side it was the unrated director's cut but there were not a lot of special features. A side from the original trailer and a few trailers from other movies there were not any special features; no making of documentary and I don't think there was a commentary either.
B0037DBM86|5.0|I highly recommend this band to anyone who enjoys TOOL, if you're a fan of them you know there aren't very many bands that you can compare them to.  My two favorite songs on this album are Goliath and Deadman, check them out on youtube, but the entire album is great.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|This is a great teaching tool to help you preschool children get introduced to letters. There are three games for each letter, which are easy enough for possibly a 1&1/2 yr old, but definately a 2yr old & beyond. My almost 4  yr old twin boys really got into putting the puzzles together and matching the shapes, while becoming more familiar with the alphabet. The graphics are very good, & very user friendly.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|POOR quality transfer, can't fix anything on picture,over rated,I would give D-. Can't reapair photos,one at a time drag, small LCD<br />need bigger screen
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Recommended if you need some background noise to fall asleep or just to relax with.  Lots of choices from which to pick.
B005TKD512|5.0|I love the way this book is written, and I loved the humour in it!! The 'steps' to take are very clearly detailed and success examples, being of people in less than perfect circumstances, makes you believe the change is possible. Now to go back and actually make some changes :)
B0000844I8|3.0|THis movie had some really strange plot twists and interesting betrayals, etc. but has anyone noticed the similarities between this movie and the Disney cartoon Atlantis: the Lost Empire that came out a year before it? The nerd scientist called in to translate, the scientific expedition, the nerd scientist falling in love with one of the inhabitants of the \\"other\\" world\\" and remaining behind at the end. The top military man that takes matters into his own hands? The list could go on. Someone was chanelling the same story when these 2 movies came out only a year apart from each other!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I honestly really love it, no complaints! Good graphics, fast paced, really well made for the kindle! Thank you for it!
B005LAII08|5.0|I ordered it because my husband liked the movie.  I did not realize it came as a digital version, DVD and Blu-ray!  Wow!  The story rang familiar for my family.  I did not know how many Irishisms had passed down over the years into our lives.  It was well done.
034580404X|5.0|I just recently received my Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy order on June 3rd. I have finished all three books in under 10 days. I couldn't stop reading, I wanted the story to keep continuing. Anyone who hasn't read these books, is definitely missing out.
B0095MVOMC|3.0|I love the scenery, but some of the numbers are just hard to figure out in each scene, it's and OK app.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a great Star Wars boxed set!  We loved every minute of it. Star Wars is AWESOME!!!! High quality video.
B007X0ZLLI|5.0|I saw this live on PBS, just had to get it, each instrument hjas a solo with Yanni.  I recommend this.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is always a good movie! I grew up watching Disney movies now my daughter gets to watch them too!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|this is a show that makes you wish you had her powers...(at times) try it you will like it very much
B00CW665VI|5.0|I wish I could give this book 6 stars - but can't<br />For those looking for a serious book that will have you pondering deep thoughts during yoga - skip this book.<br />Those people looking for a fun, make me smile and laugh out loud book - this is for you.<br />Written from the point of view from the male character throughout this book, I thought I would not like it. But I LOVED it.<br />Emma Chase did it perfectly with great humor and humility.<br />I don't care if men really think this way or not, it's hilarious!<br />The part where the male character needs to win his true love back draws on a tiny bit, but we are rooting for him the whole time. It got a bit silly, but what are romance books for if not to lose ourselves in romance?!?!<br />Emma Chase wrote these characters beautifully. We can see Drew's flaws, but they are not really flaws that we dislike him for, he is more of a younger brother that we can roll our eyes and and wait to catch up with us in the maturity lane.<br />I highly recommend this book if you want to smile, laugh and have a fun read with a bit of steamy romance!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if u like horses this will be a fun app for u. You have to work hard to keep your horses happy and it teaches responcibility.  It is also fun to compete with other horse owners and this app allows u to do just that.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|ITS accessible but ad's on pausing is annoying and sometimes I want to pause to see something but there's a stupid advertisement in my way
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It's a fun game and helps pass the time, just wish the prizes you need to finish the puzzle would be more often and wish it wouldn't take so long to gain more coins..
B005XSSEDE|5.0|I choose this rating because it was in good condition, arrived on time, and is a very good movie. I loved the sound, music, and special features of both the blu-ray and the DVD and the artwork of the box is impressive. For those of who you are interested in anime, this is the film I recommend you need.<br /><br />But if you do wish to purchase this product, always remember to keep it in good condition. For this is a technical marvel that still stands very high to this day.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great free game that does not force you to spend money to play. Very high replay factor, try out different hero types to discover which you like the best. Highly recommended.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are without a doubt the best headsets I've ever used.  They fit great and the range on this is awesome.<br /><br />I love the features where you can flip up the microphone to mute yourself automatically and the ear pads bend outward so you can set it on a flat surface in a neat way.<br /><br />It's built very good and it doesn't feel cheap.<br /><br />These work with Windows 8<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good long term headset who does not want to spend bunch of money buying low quality ones that are going to break in a couple of months.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and i like how it looks real and feels real omg oh my golly Roger I have fun playing it
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The writer did a fantastic job of all the characters backgrounds. First six chapters were dynamite. They deserved a 5. The real problem with the book, and the only one, is that<br />It flies in the face of today's women's lib and their fight for real equality.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app was really surprising when I got it mojang did a great job except for some tiny little things.<br />1 Redstone has no use  at all it just there<br /><br />2 there is no running / sprinting feature<br /><br />3it's not.as big as the pc version needs some.updates<br /> 4 there is no skins or a.good mp feature<br /><br />All together this is a great app aside from those bugs I give it four stars don't get me wrong I love minecraft I just prefer pc more than this
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Pat and tiffany's characters remind's me of  a realationship I was in with someone. After watching this I realized I might be undiagnosed crazy like she said.
1250012570|5.0|The first thing I loved about this book was its setting. Set in Omaha, Nebraska in 1986 during a year of high school. I mean, you remember high school, right? Some of you are still IN high school, but you get where I'm going.<br /><br />What a perfect setting for all of this to unfold. It's the `80s (which means amazing music), it's high school (hello `Sixteen Candles' anyone), and it's first love.<br /><br />This was a time to be different, where it was usually rewarded, right? Wrong. All an illusion. While we cheer and champion for people to be who they are and celebrate it, the truth is that society is about conformity. The question is this: who chooses it?<br /><br />I bring this up because of Eleanor's character. Talk about going against convention. And yet, she has no choice. She is returning to live with her mom, siblings, and step-father for the first time in a year. There is little money to meet the needs of the family, much less anything \\"fashionable\\" for a teenager. Eleanor will take what she gets (which is usually too big and is men's clothing). From the Goodwill.<br /><br />And so she steps on the school bus that first day (the epitome of hell for a teenager for so many reasons), with her crazy, frizzy red hair and clothes that do not meet with the conformity of Omaha teenagers. I mean, talk about the author feeding a character to the wolves.<br /><br />But it is the first day on a school bus that will change Eleanor's life. Forever.<br /><br />It doesn't happen right away. It builds slowly and snowballs into something amazingly beautiful.<br /><br />The entire time I was reading Eleanor's story, my heart was breaking in two different ways: remembering my own horrors of growing up in an abusive household and teaching students just like her.<br /><br />Eleanor's story is one of my favorites ever told in YA literature. It is raw. It is real. It transcends into another level that reminds me of the adage, \\"Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\\"<br /><br />When I speak to my students about why reading is so important--as a skill for our mind as well as for our soul--this is the type of story I am referring to. For those who have grown up privileged with money, with family, with friends, etc., Eleanor will remind you to keep and cherish them always. Not all are as lucky.<br /><br />And then there is Park. Oh Park. While I identified with Eleanor's character on so many levels, I just wanted to grab Park (and his parents) and say, \\"Thank you for having a loving heart and open mind.\\"<br /><br />When Eleanor gets on that school bus that first day, no one will allow her to sit with them. Bus seat loyalties already exist, but Park moves over. No words. Just moves. This one gesture, this one slide toward the window, changes his life too.<br /><br />And they do not speak. Park can't be seen talking with the new weird girl. While he isn't a part of the popular crowd, he isn't NOT a part of either. They kind of let him be.<br /><br />Remember the snowball I mentioned earlier? It all begins with comic books. Oh yes, that is correct. Park reads them on the bus. Eleanor does too. Park happens to notice that she seems to be following along while he's reading, so small gestures like waiting to turn the page, and leaving a few on her seat for her to take and read on her own, is how the snowball begins to build.<br /><br />Soon, words are exchanged. It seems that once the words are spoken, they build and build and turn into a beautiful friendship. I say friendship because I feel this is where the depth of their love is born. They are friends, not just two teenagers looking to get lucky with one another.<br /><br />Park seals the deal with this book. While this is Eleanor's story, there is no story without Park. He is not a boy with a golden heart looking to swoop in and save the day. He just really likes Eleanor.<br /><br />He doesn't really understand the deal with Eleanor. What he does understand is that she is cool, smart, and loves the same music he does.<br /><br />Park is what I hope my own son will be,<br /><br />But I will tell you, there is one scene in this book that grabbed at my heart so hard. It deals with Park's mom. When she first meets Eleanor, she is not so kind to her. After all, why is her son dating the new weird girl who isn't allowed to date? And then she sees Eleanor with her family at the grocery store (and that's not revealing anything important, I promise. I'll let you read that for yourself), and her whole character changes.<br /><br />Let me tell you why this particular scene is so amazing for me: without using a lot of words but instead implied meanings, the understanding that happens for Park's mom and the truth of Eleanor's circumstances brings so much beauty to the table. It is as if in that single moment she not only understands Eleanor but sees her son in a new light as well.<br /><br />So. Beautiful.<br /><br />I recommend this to all readers of all ages 12+. It is beautiful writing, storytelling, characters, etc. This book really is the whole package.mart, and loves the same music he does.<br /><br />Park is what I hope my own son will be,<br /><br />But I will tell you, there is one scene in this book that grabbed at my heart so hard.

B000000OQY|5.0|Think of this record as an extension of Appetite for Destruction. It withholds the raw street power the band once had. Much like Appetite for Destruction. No song on this record will disappoint.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|WOW, had no idea Mila could not act.  Watching her in That 70's Show for years playing a ditzy girl, her actor skills were not at a level one would critic, however here in this role was glaring...she can't act!!  How can you NOT play a witch?!  She can wear make-up and leather pants...pretty.  Opens her mouth, OMG!  (Does Disney know you have a talking part?!) Thankfully her role was limited and the movie was good.  Franco was excellent, as was Michelle and Rachel, who I don't care too much for.  Entertaining and fun to watch especially IF you are thinking you know the story....this story.<br /><br />Enjoyed the movie, just couldn't believe Mila is such a beautiful nitwit.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan you know this is one of his best (in my opinion). It just gets better every time you watch it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Imaginative visuals; stays with traditional Tintin story lines to satisfy fans. Contains frequent action scenes including chasing and fighting but compared to other PG movies, nothing too intense.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|John Wayne fans know he did very little comedy, but this one is the exception. The plot may be a little thin, but the story keeps you engaged from beginning to end. A great cast and a wonderful movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love looking through Pinterest.  I always find something new and exciting to try.  It has given me many good ideas and I feel so inspired by the beautiful photos.  A fun way to spend a few minutes or more browsing.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This product does a great job.  It is priced right and well constructed.  I would recommend heartily. A real buy!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My 4 year-old loves this video!  The morals and entertainment levels are perfect for her age group and what little girl isn't interested in princesses!  I bought the book to go with it and read it as soon as the package was opened.  This gave her the background for what she was about to see.  I'm glad to see new entertainment with high moralsl for her.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is very fun to play. I love the different worlds that they have. I highly recommend this really fun app!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great. It's a great way to use ebay on my Kindle Fire. No problems. Easy to understand and use. Connects right to paypal. I probably use the app to do most of my ebay searching and purchasing.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I've been listening to Accuradio for several years. Over the years they have continuously expanded their music genres (which are vast); and each song played conveniently shows the title, artist and abum. Also, when you click on the song it links to Amazon.com. Very cool!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was really surprising. The surprising thing about it isn't that it was written beautifully or have the most exciting story line, which is crucial in every good book and this book didn't really have those aspects. The surprising thing was that even though it was simple and had everyday things in it, it was so emotionally touching that it may be on  of the best books I have ever read. I would definitely recommend it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|It's very enjoyable game makes you think and win don't wait download it now, you won't regret I'd you do download, but you will be sorry if you don't
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first watched The Hunger Games with a friend who was visiting the islands for a few weeks, not really knowing much about the story or why it was so popular.  After my first watch of the movie, I was intrigued and decided to read the first book of the series. The story moves very quickly, and I was inspired to finish the trilogy.  I am now on the final book of the series.<br /><br />I am quite surprised at how fast a read this was.  I am not much of a fan of sci-fi genre, but this story was very mesmerizing. Perhaps, because it addresses a topic that is somewhat more than simply sci-fi escapism, but topics of universal truths of the human condition, and the seemingly impossible decisions we all must make in our day-to-day lives.  It seems to be a clever metaphor for the changing times we now live.

B007VUCAVO|1.0|Hello out there. This is Joey with another review. Why waste money on an app that you could get for free? Get Battery Doctor. Type in battery doctor in the search in appstore and see the amazing things battery doctor can do for you. If you own a version of a kindle, nook, iPad, tablet, or an up to date touch phone, battery doctor saves you 5 extra hours of battery life. I used to have to plug in my kindle every 7 hours. Now the battery lasts for 12 hours! Do not waste money, take my advice and get battery boctor.
0062238868|3.0|It was a right.  It just shows the mind set of a person in war and how you set aside all feelings to do what you need to.<br />It just shows a mind set of a person and how they justified their actions.
1781162646|5.0|I loved loved loved this book, as a long time Stephen King fan I have to say its by far one of my favorite reads. For one night  I could not put it down, I cried, smiled and stressed out. Even if you are not a Stephen King fan give it a try it trully worth it!
0316067601|4.0|Gives a view of a person dedicated to their service and duty.<br />Gives a view of a country and way of other people in that country.<br />Interesting read.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|It takes many minutes to do a search that should be done in a second or two.  Cannot go to the table of contents to select.  I've tried it on a Kindle and the Kindle for Android app and i can't come close to recommending this.  Navigation is completely horrible.
0143122916|5.0|Gives a view of a country that is a closed society.  He starts at as a total dirt wad for his mothers treatment but you can understand why he did as he did.  Wish him all the luck in the world.<br />It sounds like around the time of the Great pyramids but this was in this century.  Humans have advanced so little in some places.  Some times it is all about personal gain to some and to hell with the fodder below you.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This film exceeded my ridiculously high expectations. I was blown away. David Goyer and Zack Snyder created a masterpiece with Man of Steel. One of my concerns before going in was the casting. However, soon after the film started, those concerns were put to rest. Another aspect I was impressed by was the dialogue. Flawless, IMO. Lastly, the action is the best I have ever seen. Definitely the icing on the Superman cake! This film made me feel like a kid again and 24-hours after seeing this film, I am still beaming with joy! This is easily a Day-One buy for me and I will thoroughly enjoy it for years to come.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|I noticed a little reduction in brightness when two monitors were connected with this product but it works. I can't even be sure it is the cable that is reducing the brightness, for all I know it could be the video card. I'm happy with this, especially for the price. It is sturdy and has threaded screw holes to secure your two VGA cables to the splitter.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I couldn't get out of work fast enough to finish this. It was that amazing. I actually had to read it out loud because  it was to great stay in my head anymore. I loved loved loved it!!!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is so great even when I die because its my favorite thing trading cards.  you should try it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Awesome!!!  This book is a definite must-read for anyone looking for political suspense and intrigue.  You feel proud to be an American after reading it.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|fantastic. start to finish. being a nerd who loves sci-fi , but loves girly romances, fairy tales and anime ....not to mention Korean dramas. /cough( sure its random but my friend got me hooked) Its like all my interests were shoved together in a book that was ACTUALLY WELL WRITTEN! I've read alot of books, and currently this series is in my top NEED to follow. Even if you don't share my interests you should pick up this book !
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|The psychological insight of mr. Rubin must be phenomenal. One can say that this wonderfully well produced piece of classical rock-music is an achievement of all people involved. It is for sure the bold and dauntless attitude of this soft spoken producer that he 'understands', and I repeat: really understands, what the strong part of Black Sabbath was, and thank God, still is!<br />To be able to feel the same excitement I felt in the seventies is amazing. And yes, although I know part of it is shear nostalgia, another part comes from well educated ears that don't get fooled easily. In these days of pre-formatted time-frames I am SO happy to see two opening tracks with 8 minute length... It's so interesting to dig into a record again, and listening to it over and over, while it starts growing to you, and you slowly reveal the secrets that it contains.<br />All that said: one of the nice things about a good rock record is it's sound-impact. If you hear rock, you want to feel it, you want to be hammered down by the molecular intensity of low-tuned riffs that roar in your belly. That's materialized excitement! And that's exactly what this great record does.<br /><br />Last thing: buy the special 2 disc version. Those 3 extra tracks just flow naturally in the mood of 13.
B005LAII80|5.0|If you even think of comparing it to that terrible Stallone / Rob Schneider movie you are making a huge mistake. This did not get marketed well but is the way Dredd should look. I want a sequel.
B00917IQFY|4.0|Parker is tuned into current American politics and makes some uncomfortable but brazenly honest pronouncements. These include \\"Snake oil capital of the world\\" and, most discomfiting,\\"Coathangers.\\" Yes, girls you may need to keep them at the ready these days.<br /><br />But he also takes a poetic turn with \\"Three Chords Good,\\" which is a brilliant ode to songwriting.<br /><br />One of the best songs on the album is \\"Stop Cryin' About the Rain,\\" a very well done relationship song. You will love it.<br /><br />Hope you also stay tuned and listen to the rest of the album. It takes some work but the band definitely rewards that work.
B003G4W49C|4.0|What can I say. Once you start this book you can't put it down and before you know it it is over. A real good story with good character development. You really get to pull for all the Ender has to do and go through. The never ending challenges he is put through and the way he solves them all. Whether it be in the game or conflict with people.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was never a fan of Angry Birds until I got this game. I love how they designed the Star Wars characters as the original birds. It's like Angry Birds Space but better. There is DLC (Downloadable Content) but you can set parental controls. However my one concern is that Android and Apple get the updates faster like with Both and Cloud City. I wish they would update at the same time. Other than that it is an amazing game worthy of any Jedi.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|This book, along with The Kite Runner, has completely changed my perspective on life. The characters are so believable - so REAL, that you can almost feel what they're going through. This book made me cry. It's simply beautiful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish it was  longer but I absolutely loved this game. Can't wait for part two!! Highly recommend this game to any puzzle lover.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Each Beatles record was an advance and a revelation of some sort.  Each album introduced something creative and new. Sgt. Pepper, however, rose above the rest.  It represented a quantum leap beyond what had gone before, beginning with the cover.  It was an explosion of imagery and artistry and innovation from beginning to end.  (That might not be apparent now, over 40 years later, as the innovative techniques which the Beatles inspired and pioneered have become commonplace.)  The lyrics, the tunes, the voices, the harmonies, the instruments, the orchestrations and the technical wizardry of George Martin all conspired to reflect the spirit of the time.  This might be best embodied in the aural perfection of the closing \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  The album continues to amaze me.  When you buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, as you should, turn down the lights, turn up the sound, and just listen.  It's a trip!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Great game. I was addicted from the start. Thanks to the developers for creating such an awesome space rpg app.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Had decided to not read any more books recommended by Oprah. Didn't like any that I had read, but my book club chose this.  I am so glad they did.  It is a really good story.  I have been many of the places she visited and had lunch in Lone Pine, Ca the day I was reading the part where she was in Lone Pine.  Would recommend this book.  It is interesting that I say that because I am the last person that would hike the PCT.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for books destined to become classics.
B0089J270U|4.0|My husband and I truly enjoy musicals, especially the earlier ones.  The story line was well played out and it was entertaining; however, how many times can you see the same routine shown several times in the movie.  I realize they were going to different venues to perform, but it was monotonous after two or three times seeing and hearing the same routines..  The finale with the entire cast back together again with the performance of &#34;There is No Business Like Show Business&#34; was fantastic and worth waiting through the less interesting numbers.  You have to love the entire cast with the exception of Marilyn Monroe.  Not a big fan which is my problem.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love it.  Fan of the series always welcoming more parts to the sega.  Still don't know why she didn't choose the wolf boy :) I would have.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Read the first book in the series in one day and read this one in less than a day. Sad I have to wait for book 3.
0439023513|2.0|Angry, broken, empty, unsettled, BETRAYED - this is the feeling I can't shake even days after finishing Mockingjay.  I loved the first two books and consumed them within days, looking forward to book 3 with more anticipation than probably any other book in a series.  Then, *blam!* chapter by chapter, Collins begins crushing everything I loved about the first two books.  I tried to retain hope that at least the ending would make up for it, but think again, the author delivered one last sucker punch: a cheap, rushed and totally unsatisfying ending. After the last page, I wanted to throw the book at a wall, yell at the author, demand a rewrite.  I cannot accept this is how the series ends.  The only thought that makes me feel better is, 'they better fix this in the movie version!!'<br /><br />********SPOILERS*****************<br /><br />I expected the story to take a dark turn and for important characters to die.  This is not my issue.  What I cannot accept is that the author pulls a total bait and switch - writing two books with an amazing flow, characters that are witty, interesting and relatable, a love story full of promise brimming near the surface...only to slap the reader in the face with an entirely different kind of third book: slow, empty, confusing, cold, detached, depressing.  Where the love story stalls out to preach about war, too much action happens 'off-screen' (and we're simply told about it later instead of shown), and main characters are frequently missing or routinely acting in ways that seem totally illogical.  At one point, it's even admitted that Katniss is an emotional robot. This is not the story I signed up to read!  I signed up to read the story about the girl who continues to beat impossible odds, helps her country win a revolution, and finally embraces love, not a descent into madness story.  I feel deceived and cheated.<br /><br />In short, I feel the real Gamemaker is Collins, luring the pawns (readers) with a false glimmer of hope and victory, only to gleefully yank it away when it seems closest, much like the heartless Capitol.<br /><br />I can not, will not accept that:<br /><br />- Katniss suddenly goes from nightmares to PTSD, routinely checks out mentally/emotionally, and becomes a pain-killer addict.<br /><br />Are you kidding me?!?!  This is a girl who grew up watching the hunger games yearly and her neighbors routinely starve to death.  Been through not one, but two arenas herself!  Hated her mother for checking out and despised watching people (Haymitch, morphlings) use drugs to do it.  If she's going to suffer a breakdown, it should be after Finnick or Prim's death, not right after the Quarter Quell, in which nothing terribly different happens that she hasn't already seen.  It's maddening how often she just hides and falls asleep in closets.  I wanted to yell at her, \\"get up! You don't have many chapters left to finally stop being a pawn and take charge!\\"  I can't imagine the movie version will do well unless they tone this part down, which I'm greatly looking forward to.<br /><br />- She becomes extremely accident prone and practically lives in the hospital<br /><br />Ugh. Right from the start with Katniss' head injury from Johanna, she just takes way too long to heal.  The concussion wasn't so bad that she couldn't run to the beach and shoot out the arena forcefield, but now suddenly, she's has to bedridden and drugged up beyond recognition?  By the time she gets shot, I'm rolling my eyes that yet again, the author has hit the 'send to hospital' button and we miss out on Katniss actually moving forward.  It also gets really old being stuck with a first-person narrator that's trapped in a haze and has to be told 'here's what happened while you were sleeping...'.  I loved being inside Katniss' head when she was lucid and plotting her next move, but this is just painful to read.  The last straw was Prim's death.  Just as Katniss is about to finally accomplish one major goal (killing Snow),she ends up on fire and (of course) back in the hospital.  She misses the fall of the Capitol.  She even misses her own trial.  These things just kind of work themselves out while she's knocked out.<br /><br />-  That the Mockingjay's power mostly went to waste (in my view)<br /><br />Why disappoint us after so much foreshadowing that Katniss would finally take control of her destiny?  Telling us leaders feared her for a good reason.  All the people that bet on her (Cinna, Finnick, etc). Peeta saying she didn't know her own effect and she should find out more about what Coin/District 13 were really up to.  Instead, she has a few moments of briefly fighting back, but spends more time playing powerful on TV, plus one very long and disastrous mission that ends in being almost pointless.  She's basically handed Snow and Coin.  Why couldn't she have at least made it into the mansion to take out Snow?  Seen Prim burn and used that to make her death count, while turning around and then taking out Coin in the process?  Paylor could know that Coin was evil and pardon Katniss.<br /><br />- The love story resolution is missing about 20 pages of detail<br /><br />Of course Katniss loves Peeta and should be with him.  This is the right ending, but how about letting the readers actually SEE that happen!!!  Haven't we earned it?  Instead, we are simply told they 'grow back together'.  We're cut out, disinvited from the action.  And then, oh yeah,  by the way, they're married and have 2 nameless kids that might have a chance at happiness.  That's it?!  After 2.75 books of Katniss building up to finally accepting her love for Peeta and telling him, of Collins taunting us in detail with situations in which Katniss has the chance to finally embrace him and say it, the readers deserve better!  Here's where she could have/should have done/said more:<br />  -When she visits him after he's rescued from being viscously tortured.  He's brainwashed and can't reciprocate, but so what?  He'salive!  (Nope, instead she's defensive and hurt.)<br />  -When she sees him in the cafeteria and he alludes to memories of there being more between them.  (Nope, instead she gets up and walks off with Gale! wth?)<br />  -When she's guarding him at camp and they're playing the real/not real game.  (Nope, as soon as she starts to get emotional , she runs to hide it, ugh!)<br />  -When she kisses him to help him calm down from an episode (wow, and then just goes back to what she was doing?!).<br />  -When she leaves him at Tigress' house, knows he has a nightlock pill (!) and that she may never return alive from Snow's mansion (come on already!!)<br />  -Finally, last chance, it has to be when she sees him for the first time back in District 12, out in her yard, alive, no current life-threatening dangers  (Nope, she just says `oh you're back' and then runs off.  SERIOUSLY!!!??)<br /><br />This was actually one of the most upsetting things to me.  It feels so incomplete and passionless.  Ruined.  Is this really how I'm supposed to feel at the end of this story? Collins says they do have passion, so where the hell is it?<br /><br />I gave the book two stars because there were a few things that were great:<br />- Shooting President Coin and thereby ending the Hunger Games for good<br />- Katniss' relationships with Johanna and Finnick<br />- Cinna's foresight in planning, knowing he'd probably be killed<br />- Peeta mostly returning to himself<br />-  The cat's part in this book
B0000029DD|5.0|Through the sixties and seventies, Tim Buckley was the man.  I grew up on him and was devastated at his death.<br /><br />Around the time that Jeff came out, I was way into reggae.  I missed him then. But this year, I found out that Jeff had had a career too.  It is too bad that both of them died so young.  I was listening to this album and when Corpus Christi Carol came on, I started to cry.  I had never in my life heard anything as beautiful as that.  Jeff had a fabulous voice!<br /><br />I know that he would not have liked to be compared with his father, but as I listen to Jeff, I can hear Tim through him.<br /><br />This is a wonderful album.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|Purchased last night and had my grandson for the day.  He is four months and it was a great toy for him to play with for a while.  He really liked the cat and bird it was great to watch him try to reach for them.  I don't think it would be the best toy for him everyday because I believe he may get bored.  A great toy to have at grandparents house because it is small and don't take up a lot of room.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Everything was great, 10/10. 3D is seamless and adds a lot to the fight scenes. Movie is funny and action packed.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Simple, clean, exciting, mysterious, and very well acted. The cast is brilliant! Jeff Nichols is a fantastic writer-director. His new film Mud is also very well done.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|too bad you can't  see season 5 unless you buy it or lease it on amazonI I enjoyed every minute.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Good album. The deep resonating voice and interesting poetic lyrics are here again. The National is going strong with this new release.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|the music is amazing and the arrived as anticipated. i would recomend to any one, buy this cd it is awesome ! !
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This calendar is great. User friendly.  It helps me keep track my aging parent's many doctors appointments as well ad my own family's schedule. It even syncs with other calendars you may already be using. I recommend this app!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Nothing says summer like Vampire Weekend. Each of their albums is slightly diff so they take a couple listens to get used to ...that being said by the 3rd time you hear the cd you will be addicted to the music. A must buy... I suggest getting the CD or Vinyl...Why not own the physical medium....especially because the package is so iconic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to play when you have nothing to do! I thought i may be too old to keep up with the required speed for the game, but I am actually doing ok! Give the younger one's a run for their money and prove you're never too old!!!
B009P13RQY|5.0|With epically heavy guitar riffs and lore based lyrics, this is another must have album from The Sword. They are slowly changing it up ever since &#34;Warp Riders&#34; came out, but the basic heavy metal foundation still exists. The production value of this album compared to their last 3 is miles ahead and will make any respecting audiophile proud. I have seen these guys live twice so far and let me tell you...these guys are the real deal!
0385720920|5.0|Like some people, I discovered other Chuck Palahniuk after graduating Fight Club.  I did not understand the cult following that Chuck has just from reading Fight Club.  Post-Choke, like the great awakening, I finally get it.  Palahniuk is a jedi master of an author.  This is my second favorite book of all time, right behind Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock (which is an entirely different animal than this).  Read the description.  If it sounds interesting, immediately put it in your amazon cart and do not look back.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|These 60 year old men have been through so much in their lifetime. I'm not sure if this will be their last album ever or not...but they sure went out with a bang if it is!! This album is one of the heaviest things I have ever heard. Ozzy literally sings his heart out while Tony Iommi lays down the sickest riffs I have heard ever. If you call yourself a metal fan, pick up a copy of this album and remember why these guys are the founders of metal!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't normally read but the moment I started it I couldn't put the book down ! Good read if in mood for a love story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing<br />I love this game, I can  put it down. My kids think the game is great to its  pretty all they talk about anymore
B00BF123WG|4.0|acting was superb.  should have showed loading hard drive evidence and body into helo.  could have had vignettes of burial in ocean.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not like this book  it. Is not my type of read . It was ordered  by mistake and I did not read it I cannot recommend it
B009MYARIK|5.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella/Madeliene Wickham fan, and this book did not disappoint! I will never tire of losing myself in one of her books...a lovely distraction from real life :)
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Great female vocalist.  If you like Bonnie Raite or other female performers you love Gardot.  Good mellow music for a sunday afternoon
0399226907|5.0|How do people give this book a bad review?  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a classic.  This little board book is going to last for years and I can't wait to read it to my little one.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|Having loved the book, my wife and I battled bravely to try to make it through the movie.<br /><br />I suspect we made it about half way.<br /><br />This movie was a bore, with none of the charm or beauty of the book.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Inventive and very funny. Trite but true, I could not put it down. Do not miss this book. Great read.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I figured that Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe could carry the film. They both try very hard but even their talent couldn't fix this mess.<br />It's over the top gore wise. The \\"rap\\" music score is a terrible distraction. It makes the film darn near unwatchable. This film is a loser.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. once said he was born to play Chaplin, and boy, is that the truth.  Excellent in every way.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched it when it came out but thought it was ok.  Seeing that it was available on Prime, I decided to watch it again and found a wholly more enjoyable movie the second time around.  Having not read the book, I was not sure what to expect and the first time and was slightly taken aback by the story.  Not so the next time I watched, having now understood the characters and their predicaments, this has made me very excited to see the next installment in the series on the big screen in November.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The game is another Mahjong game but to me the layout is easier to see on tablets and phones. Usually on the phones its impossible to see the tiles but they did a good job on the tiles being readable. There are many levels. I would suggest this game to others.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I never write reviews and I read all the time but had say this book was not worth the it, like the first two. I read of another person who gave a written review on this third book that it seems Sylvia just wrote this book for money, just to sell a third book because the first two were good. Well, I'm starting to feel that same way. The third book Entwined with You is not about anything, it just circles around different unimportant things happing in their lives. Nothing really happens. I would suggest just wait for the forth book, if one comes out and read that because there is nothing in this book that you need to wait to read. Very disappointed, and waiting months for it to come out. The author (Sylvia Day) writes good books and in my opinion she knew it wasn't anything special in this book before it went on sale and that's what is wrong for the people who enjoyed the story and purchased the three books. Will I purchase a forth book, sure I need to know what happens but this third book, I'd want my money back.  Sorry Sylvia but please write a forth book that will make us change our minds and soon.
B00000GAIW|5.0|You can't go wrong with buying this cd. One of best jethro tull cd's out def worth the money. would recommend buying
B00AREIAI8|4.0|checked it out thinking my 3rd old twins might enjoy it with out realizing how detailed it was...now I'm slightly hooked taking care of &quot;beauty&quot; older kid's will probably get into this app quickly.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|It was okay, it wasn't everything it was amped up to be. there were some cool parts and some shocking parts.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I can't wait to get the following book! As I so much loved the first one that I finished it within a day...
B00AAQHP66|4.0|Like the movie it is about true people and the surfing action is insane. It is a good rainy day film
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This album is typical Michael Bluble as he sings his way into you mind and heart!  He puts his mark on old favorites and new songs.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The story of Jaimie McCloone is tragic, sad and at the same time humorous at times.  I totally enjoyed reading this book and its unexpected outcome.  If you like a fast yet satisfying read you will love this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app has literally changed my life! I've become much more active; I bake, craft, and create more than ever before! I also found so many fandoms I'm a part of to share my obsessions, and it so incredibly fun! After I told one of my friends about it, she got this app and now she is so glad I showed her it. I would suggest this app ti anyone and everyone. There is so much to find and share, from the beauty of landscapes to the fandoms of Doctor Who, and everyone will find something. I guarantee it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was funny and awesome cant wait to the new one comes out wonder what that is going to be about.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|Heard 'em live 1 1/2 yrs. ago.  This is the best of their all-around cd's with all of their biggest hits.  Excellent quality and sound for GK fans.
B00433SVP6|5.0|This book was amazing! It was very gripping which was surprising since Percy wasn't in it!<br />I'm looking forward to picking up the next book and can't wait for them to find Percy . Does anyone else see Piper aspiring to be the Greek version of Sadie Kane ,well we certainly need one to keep drew in check ! ^u^<br />I would totally recommend this book series to anyone but you should read the Percy Jackson series first!
B005JABN8Y|5.0|the product arrived very clickly and was very great it was like the image but the problem was it didn't said that the caracters was 0.5 inch tall
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Its fun but still challenging at the same time. Can't wait to get farther in game. Really cool. Executing<br />Great game.
B006LSZECO|1.0|No one in my book club liked it & we couldn't figure out why it is so popular since there are so many wonderful books to read.
B000002KE2|5.0|I have been a Sabbath fan for over 36 years. Volume 4 is one of their best releases. Highly recommend this album from the original Metal Gods.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author intertwined history with fantasy, and did a remarkable job. I read the first two books in this trilogy in 4 days; they are easy to read and you can't put them down. I highly recommend this trilogy...except wait for the third book to be released before you start reading. The anticipation for finality is highly annoying. Great job, Ms. Harkness!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Contains some killer dark riffs. The influence of Chris Cornell is obvious. Audioslave sounds very similar to Soundgarden. If you like Soundgarden then you will like this album.
B00338QENI|5.0|I enjoyed this book, and believe that it should be mandatory reading for seniors in high school. Thank you, Ms. Skloot, for writing this book and providing the world with the Lacks family's story. I will definitely pass along the information about the story of Henrietta Lacks!
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I've listened to this record several times in order to let it settle in to my psyche as I always do with BoC. I can't help but associate the vast landscapes of this music to the visages of the brilliant Koyanisqaatsi: Life Out of Balance. Rather than attempt to give an audiophile's critique I will simply state that this recording is a stunning commentary of us; of how we've managed, in less than a century, to lose our connection with the natural world. Maybe it's a cautionary tale? Listen, in particular, to \\"New Seeds\\". There's hope among the dust. Thank you, BoC, for this seminal work of art.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely am in love with this game! It's so entertaining, and gives me something I love to do in my spare time. The dragons are so cute and the mechanics of completing tasks emphasizes the way you should care for your dragons. This game brings me euphoria and I'm sure you will love it as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A truly original story about a dystopian future. Flawlessly written.  I couldn't put it down.  Stop thinking about it and just get it - you won't be disappointed.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story is not like any other I've read which takes place in a rural mid-seventies Ireland about a simple man and parallels with a simple woman, both single never married in their early 40's who meet through a newspaper singles ad.  At first you are to believe this man and woman are set to be together romantically in the end, however the story takes such an interesting turn, certainly not what I was expecting. There are parts that will bring tears to your eyes and rip at your heart, but all in all a very touching story that is believable with past and present stories of what brings these two people together, the end sort of came a bit unexpectedly, since I was reading on a Kindle, and maybe I would've liked it to had another chapter, but still a wonderful story.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game has plenty to keep you busy, the hidden objects searches are well thought out and I oftentry to redo the object search is just because I enjoyed them. Although many are used several times in a row looking for different objects it does not take anything from the game and overall is a fun game, definitely one worth checking out.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I have water damaged many phones that I've owned. When I finally upgraded to an iPhone, I had to get a good case. Otter boxes don't fully protect like this one does. My local news station, KWCH12 has a &#34;Does it Work?&#34; segment and when I saw how great this does work, I had to get it. They buried the iPhone in sand, threw it in water, etc. Best investment that pays off in the long run. Knowing me I would have had to buy a whole new phone. The only downside is that it makes it a little hard to text as fast because the touch screen, while still being very accurate, isn't as accurate for this speed texting 18 year old. :) I'd recommended this to anyone. Oh, and I LOVE the color. I'm kind of pink obsessed:) And it fits perfectly for my 4s!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books do not disappoint! I totally recommend the entire series. Hopefully the author hasn't given up writing cause I will definitely look for more of her books.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|This 8-disc blu ray set seemed like such a great deal. Seemed great when it came too until we went to play the first disc. We have a blu ray player and 1080p hdtv. The movie just started to play with no previews or menu which seemed odd. Then the movie started... It was such poor video quality it looked like a bootleg. Our DVD version of the Harry potter movies looks better than these \\"blu ray\\" copies. The sound quality was also very poor. These were NOT BLU RAY. I don't know what happened because I called customer service and they said they were sold straight from amazon so they could not be counterfeit. But these were not blu ray copies. Thank goodness I was still able to return them
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It could have been more funny. Something is missing and I can't tell you what it is. But I didn't laugh as much as I though. I though the creator of Family Guy will make me laugh to death.. not this time!
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|My 2 year old grand daughter can't get enough of it.  We now all know the words to many of the scenes.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie was too slow. Acting was good, make-up excellent.. just it was missing something. I feel asleep one hour into it!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|the movie turned out to be pretty good. Although Amazon's instant video quality was ridiculously horrible. the video was very pixelated making it hard to see the movie often. I would recommend renting this on on a physical disk than renting instant video.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I haven't enjoying watching actors act like that for years. Leonardo and the German fellow did an amazing job. Nice one.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Being a Buble fan already, I just loved this album.  Michael, of course, has a fabulous voice and wonderful style.  Thanks
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|So fun, couldn't put it down. Love the challenge it presents and how it made me jump! Ready for another G5 game!
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie is moving a little away from her country roots!  The album is a good one, and Blown away has the country theme to it.  I just loved Who Are You!  Keep it up Carrie, we just love you.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So many of these types of books lately have little to no plot and WAY too much sex.  This book is no exception.  Too much of \\"I love you, you're mine!!!\\"  \\"I love looking at him.\\"  \\"He's so beautiful.\\"  \\"He's mine!\\"  I had to skim over those parts which is a good part of the book.<br />It's all filler with no actual plot and all of a sudden the BDSM is thrown it??<br />This could've been so much better if there was more story line.
B000U6BT40|4.0|This is a fun show w/likeable characters and easy to watch episodes.  I would say that some episodes are PG13 rated w/language and adult themes, but most of them are PG.  Wish I would have supported it while it was on air, but it is nice to sit back and know you can watch all 5 seasons uninterrupted.  Give it a chance and I think you will like it. :)
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Punch quest is awesome, the best part is when you reach an<br />egg I mean a goat as a unicorn so creative.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter based on all the great reviews.  when I opened the game it needed to do an additional download that has not completed all week!!  This is ridiculous and I plan to uninstall since we can't play.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I wasn't really expecting much from a free sound machine app but I was blown away by the selection. There are many different sounds; all are comforting and soothing to fall asleep to. What I really like is that there's  a timer so that after the specific time is up, whatever sound you choose will turn off. It's not going to stay on the entire night, wasting the battery. I have used this app almost every night since got it and I will continue to use it.
B0086700CM|5.0|My whole family loves this game. You don't want to put it down. It is so addicting and fun to play.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|I didn't pay for this movie. I watched it on the movie channel. This review may contain spoilers, so if you're some bright eyed, optimistic person reading this, then turn away. I, too, had high hopes once. But no more. It started off well, with scantily clad sexy men dancing across my television screen. I was pleased...upbeat music....dancing men....the bar was high. Then there was talking....and more talking....more talking than sexy dancing....I was confused. What was this? Talking? After confusion, came disappointment. The talking just wouldn't end. My spirits would rally with another dance scene...and then....more talking. This movie was formulaic and predictable. Honestly, if you like chick-flicks, you'll probably like this movie. I don't. Let's call a spade a spade; I had a crappy day and I wanted to see scantily clad packages bouncing around. There was very little of that. Seeing this movie has been the pickle on the crap sandwich that has been my day. The fault does not lie with the actors and please don't think I'm bashing their performances. The fault lies with the director who made a movie about male strippers and kept them dressed most of the film. Perhpas the fault is mine. I shouldn't have expected a movie to salvage this day. I may wake up tomorrow and see that this review was too harsh. Tonight, with my disappointment fresh and bitter, it feels just...
B0046ECJBY|2.0|Mariusz,said it quite well and there is very little to add.It could have been a great book if Kissinger would not have overplayed his own role.Even Helmut Schmidt,German,s Ex-Kanzler,said it in his last book.\\" The book is more about Henry then China\\".And they are great friends.Anyhow if you want a first rate analysis of China I do recommend anything what Harry Yew wrote.His insights are deeper and well founded in History.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote for several years now and have it on all of my platforms.<br /><br />It has been helpful countless times and of critical assistance many.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great features. Able to change alarm sound. Easy to use. Increasing alarm volume is perfect and hard to ignore. I haven't slept through the alarm since I switched to this app from a standard alarm clock.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a n excellent game. However, some levels can be difficult to see due to the small size of the tiles.
B00009R86L|5.0|I love Domke products, but most of his bags will carry a lot more equipment than you think, so the bags get very heavy very quickly.  I have several of these.  A lot of comfort and for not much more than the cost of a book of stamps!  LOL!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a hot book could not put it down!!! Can't wait for the next book. I'm hooked on this series.
0321544080|5.0|I've been involved in photography since the late 60's and have hundreds of books, but I never tire of reading how other photographers get the image.  Digital has changed photography, but it still all begins with the eye.  Excellent book!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Action packed and I am a huge Liam Neeson fan so I always enjoy watching his films. Taken is fantastic!
0786886811|5.0|This is my all-time favourite book. It is me bed time de-stress book and Nigella's way of writing is so witty and personal that you almost feel as though you know her by the end of the book!
B002GJT4XM|5.0|we just love the dvd me and my wife loves harry potter we just loved watching the behind the sense
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of the the Sookie Stackhouse books and they are never a disappointment.  As always it was fun and entertaining book to read!  I will miss this series.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I saw Lindsey Stirling on a video and thought her music was hauntingly beautiful and the visuals very creative.<br />Her CD is excellent for those that love violin music...and she sings, too!  Love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The most important thing to know going into The Fault in Our Stars, I think, is that the dialogue is *totally* unrealistic. The heroine and hero are 16 and 17, and nobody, and I mean that literally, nobody talks the way these kids talk, especially but not limited to teenagers. Think about the fast-paced and overly deep dialogue in &#34;Gilmore GIrls&#34; or anything by Aaron Sorkin, novelized.<br /><br />And it's absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />So Hazel and Augustus don't talk the way people really talk. The thing about it is that they talk the way people *feel*, and that's what makes great stories great stories and real life so often boring and confusing and frustrating -- we can never quite say things the way we mean them, but these characters can.<br /><br />And this is a great story. Not in the sense that the plot pulls you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat, nothing like that; I knew more or less what would happen from the first 25 pages or so. It just doesn't matter. The language is captivatingly beautiful--I doubt there were ten wasted words in the whole thing--and Green has a way of phrasing certain maybe-otherwise-unremarkable observations about life and human nature that makes them thought-provoking and soul-rattling and unforgettable. And the way things unfold, even if you know exactly how they're unfolding, is beautiful and heart-wrenching. I really can't recommend this enough, and would to just about anyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know a lot of people dislike the book because it's not the end. Well I don't see the problem.....I can't get enough so I'm glad there will be more Gideon and Eva coming our way. The book has some hot and heavy love scenes, very romantic parts, a lot of drama and has Gideon expressing himself in ways he didn't in the first two books. The shocker towards the end really made me happy. I loved this book. Totally worth the wait. Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
0062080237|5.0|I was born in sight of the Golden Gate Bridge. As a child, my family lived in every state in the western US before entering my own traveling period in the early 1970s, eventually settling in New York. I've seen the Midwest, from the road and driven all over the South, from Key West, to New Orleans. Like the Johnny Cash song says, \\"I've been everywhere, Man...\\" but something brand new dawned on me while I was reading Neil Gaiman's great book, American Gods (10th Anniversary Edition), this past week. I realized that my own perceptions of my homeland are defined by the fact of my being born here. Maybe a broader view has to come from outside our borders. Thanks, Mr. Gaiman. You've opened my eyes a little wider.<br /><br />No matter the geographic size of the US, the cultural size of our nation is much, much larger. Large enough to contain the dreams of almost all the world's people. Those living now, and all of those who lived before. Gaiman's grand travelogue of the spirit is a remarkable book on several levels. First, it's a great, wild ride. While it is a cracking fantasy tale of ultimate belonging and redemption, filled with memorable human and non-human, shifty and recognizable characters, it is also a grand lesson. The author teaches us gently, with gem-like specimens of the variety of cultures and locales that make this place what it is. He alternates story chapters with parallel and divergent sidebar-like small nuggets and stories of places and the hardships of those who came to America from their old homes and those who were here to watch them arrive.<br /><br />Towards the end, I was deeply moved by Gaiman's masterful phrasing and thought-provoking explanations. He really knocked me out with a very special gift, waiting within a paragraph describing a line of small gods on their way to do battle, of a nod to Richard Adams' Shardik (one of my very favorite fantasy novels), or so it appeared to me. My memory kicked into high gear displaying mental images of characters and phrases from a lifetime of reading, and I found myself swept away by a feeling of compassion for our species. At our heart, we are really nothing more than small, frightened children, sheltering in a cave near a fire, afraid of what lies beyond our sight. What was, still is. Invention and construction and all our knowledge remains nothing more than our attempts to shine some light everywhere we can't really see clearly.<br /><br />American Gods is one of the most satisfying reads I've had the pleasure of engaging in, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history, a sense of place, and has an eye for detail. It encompasses a monumental range of philosophy, character and landscape and is as big as the sky over the Great Plains.<br /><br />A Note on the Edition: The author explains that this edition contains some previously edited material. I would say that the restored section of the conversation involving Jesus is worth the price of the book on its own.racters and phrases from a lifetime of reading, and I found myself swept away by a feeling of compassion for our species.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle Android app and have been using it to read books for quite some time. A nice addition to a future upgrade to the app would be enabling the use of Samsung's Air gestures to turn pages.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This is the kind of game you do on the bus to drive the guy next to you crazy.  Also great when sitting on the pot or waiting for the waitress to bring your order. The changing physics and widths &amp; heights of the pillars keeps you on the edge and makes the game challenging.  This is the kind of game that you will play &quot;just one more time&quot; over and over just to see if you can get a little further. It is the kind of game that you can play for just a minute or for an hour.  This game makes me twist around and lean over in my chair to in a vain attempt to help the little guy land on the pillar.  Hey ~ it's only a buck. Buy it!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A great time- I love coming of age stories and this one is well told and well written. Enjoy the ride! Can't wait for the next one!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Great series. We have been watching dexter since the beginning. And we were so surprised that we got our order before it was even released.
B000JVT09C|2.0|A comic-book movie that vanishes from memory. Rather than soar to new heights, \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006) emulates director Richard Donner's 1978 classic. Sincere performances fail to redeem this overlong, lackluster revival. Not the embarrassment of \\"Superman IV\\" (1987) yet disappointingly familiar.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I thought the layout of the multiple stories was ingenious but I also found it hard to keep focused. But disclaimer I have ADD. I loved the ideas of the book. Greed selfishness is human kinds extinction. Read it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|My guilty pleasure.  I am hoping this series ends well...I think Dexter and Deb have to die in this final season (8).  Been a fan for many years.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very good sharpener, looks cheap but it sharpens very nicely, for the money it's definitely worth it!  No doubt! Buy it!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I liked this addition and thought it was on par with the first two books. Martin has not lost the shock value of his twists and turns.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really great game. Kept me entertained for hours.  Graphics and puzzles were excellent . Cant wait to play another one!
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie it has all.  Thrill ,suspense, romance and happy ending!<br /><br />Clear picture quality and no interruption while video streaming.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|A really good game, lot of dinosaurs you'll be happy to collect them all, like I do. A little slow if you don't use real money but it's a good game for free.
B00D3V97DO|3.0|I'm quite a \\"young\\" Sabbath / Ozzy fan: they have been playing non-stop in my LP's + cassettes > CD's > mp3's for about ~23 years.<br /><br />I say that this is a good album after a run through it (good = 3 stars; great = 4; F.A. = 5): Oz sounds good as always, Tony has some great riffs and Gzr provides the wall behind it all - but let's not fool ourselves.<br /><br />We will never get anything that will match the immortal classics we always loved (e.g.: Black Sabbath, NIB, Paranoid, Snowblind, Sweet Leaf, Wizard, SBS, Symptom, etc... Of course with Ozzy's vocals). However, I like this album and recommend it.
B0017I91LI|5.0|It was an excellent story very dramatic.I am a strong fan of Daniel Day Lewis and of his earlier works like My Left Foot and The Last Of The Mahicans.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Twitter is \\"okay,\\" I guess. Not very user-friendly when compared to Facebook. I'd dump it in a New York minute if I wasn't following a famous relative.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great UI. Very useful for people with cluttered thoughts like mine. Absolutely love it. Saves a lot of paper too! :)
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book is amazing. It's funny in such an unexpected way!  Maybe it's because it's a translation or maybe it's because the author's mind works in ways we're not accustomed to.  In any case, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  There were laugh out loud events and there was a lot of history wrapped up in the fiction.  The 100-year old man, Allen, gives those of us who are getting older hope that there may be even more exciting adventures to be had if we have the courage to climb out of the window and disappear!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game. I'm. giving it 5 stars because it's. entertaining and fun.Hope you have fun when you play this game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy read and entertaining. We would recommend it.  A lot of unexpected twists and turns. Can't wait to read more from this author.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game has great graphics and progresses at a good rate. It plays like call of duty back in the PlayStation 2 days. Considering the fact that it's a free game it's a must download for the kindle fire HD
B000B589JI|5.0|Finally, got it straight and forward, with no reviews to read and doubts.Such an item you need when in love with Zippo lighters!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I was attracted to this book from the title because I'm a musician and always talk about creativity. This is really great book not only for the information on creativity but the layout and design. Very inspiring and a must have for all creative libraries.
3836538725|5.0|For those who have followed the career and artistic output of Sebastiao Salgado this new book GENESIS will come as no surprise. His vistas of unadulterated nature, shimmering in the lighting he gains form his patient use of the camera, his images of cultures we rarely see, his manner of capturing the lifestyles of animals and birds, and the overwhelming powerful images of man creating/existing/ at labor/at rest - it is all here in some of the most magnificent photographs of the way this world adapts to man and all species.<br /><br />As the promo for the book expresses, `GENESIS, the result of an epic eight-year expedition to rediscover the mountains, deserts and oceans, the animals and peoples that have so far escaped the imprint of modern society - the land and life of a still pristine planet. On over 30 trips - traveled on foot, by light aircraft, seagoing vessels, canoes, and even balloons, through extreme heat and cold and in sometimes dangerous conditions - Salgado created a collection of images showing us nature, animals, and indigenous peoples in such shocking and intense beauty it takes our breath away. In GENESIS, one discovers the animal species and volcanoes of the Gal&aacute;pagos; the penguins, sea lions, cormorants, and whales of the South Atlantic; Brazilian alligators and jaguars; and African lions, leopards, and elephants. Through Salgado's lens, we travel over icebergs in the Antarctic, the volcanoes of Central Africa, the ravines of the Grand Canyon, and the glaciers of Alaska. We encounter the Stone Age Korowai people of West Papua, nomadic Dinka cattle farmers in Sudan, Nenets and their reindeer herds in the Arctic Circle, as well as the Mentawai jungle communities on islands west of Sumatra. This immensely impressive book was designed and edited by L&eacute;lia Wanick Salgado, and features exquisitely reproduced large-format images arranged not by theme or region but rather conceived as a portfolio that takes beholders on a journey around the globe, immersing them in Salgado's vision of the Earth's mesmerizing scale, order, and beauty.'  This is indeed destined to become a Collector's Item. Grady Harp, June 13sing them in Salgado's vision of the Earth's mesmerizing scale, order, and beauty.'

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Using more of the original cast would be a great improvement. Rated as only fair as it did not have the drive or the intensity of the original production..
B003QTUQGU|3.0|This is Alice in Wonderland gone wild, and Johnny Depp was his usual weird self.  Perhaps young adults/teens would enjoy this. I actually used a clip in my English class, and my students enjoyed it (not my most immediate goal but definitely a plus).
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The remastered CD's sound incredible & the mono recordings let you hear the songs as the Beatles intended. It's great to hear the mixes they spent all their time creating instead of the fake stereo with music on one side & vocals on the other that The Beatles weren't even involved in the mixes. Sounds totally different than what I've been listening to for the last 50 years! These mono mixes will blow you away! Thanks, Amazon & Gohastings!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I think this is a great app! I still like wedding salon better though. I bought the full version of both and it is worth your money! I think it is great for all ages.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's awesome for a free game. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes park builders. It is a good game.
B008FPZQRO|4.0|First- Fast ship and fine condition. That being said, can one have too much Tarkus? Maybe. Three CDs (actually 2 CD/1DVD) might be a little much, maybe more than you'll ever need. Still, it's a great work, and I appreciate it now even more than I did back then when it was released.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fantastic game that lets you work with horses without the mess. Also good for kids and teenagers that get extremely bored. Your horse won't die if you don't play for a while so don't worry about that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large screen and numbers are nice for calculating. Simple format for adding percent are  great.  Several friends have commented on the large display.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read. A real page-turner. The story takes a lot of unexpected turns. Ready for the next Grisham work. Thanks.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I have been waiting for a QOTSA album for a while and this does not disappoint! This is a job well done!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game even tho I cant even afford a real live horse. but this just makes me happy to actually have my horse I always wanted Thanks so much!(:
B0012GN404|5.0|Fast ship, fine condition. Still as good now as it was in the 60's. Lots of nostalgia here, and I have no complaints whatsoever. Not as powerful as Cheap Thrills, but as Janis Joplin's debut, still a great album, and a psych classic!
B003L5BRXK|5.0|This is my favorite Stones album.  Every song is a classic.  Unfortunately songs are not written or recorded like this anymore.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My fave bingo app. Great free tourneys and fun to play.  Would totally go for it!  Can play without having to pay for credits all the time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I pass the time way when i&#34;m bored.  It's refreshing and makes you use your brain.  Hope you enjoy it as much.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season was as much fun as the first.  Can't wait to see season 3.  Again, great job by the actors.
0743487486|5.0|my husband took the book I ordered because he liked it so much to work with him for his counselling clients ... I had to buy another one for me worth it
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Thanks for the professionalism & efficiency. Fast and easy to use and download, the kids enjoy this fun popcap game.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The Quell games are simple, quiet puzzle games that work by tickling your brain rather than requiring twitch reflexes. I love the first two games in this series, and having just finished this one can say that it's a worthy sequel.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This series is great for young readers (and really adults too).  I found the Hunger Games Series to be well-written and extremely entertaining.  They sure beat another popular teen series about vampires.  Catching Fire suffers a bit, like the second book in most series, as the author tries to get the reader from where they were in the first book to where the author wants to take the reader in the third book.  This was my least favorite of the three, despite this it is still an excellent read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game if you like playing with your friends on Facebook it is also never ending so you can get something new every so often.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|What fan of doctor who doesn't wanna run around pretending he or she is the doctor trying to save the galaxy.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|If you like the old Black Sabbath you will like this album.  This is classic Black Sabbath music.  I'm happy to add it to my collection.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Thanks for the professionalism & efficiency. This product is exactly what I was looking for to go with my collection.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book takes a while to get into and understand the relationships of the characters that are introduced.  Once that is clear in  your mind you find yourself being able to follow and relate in some ways to the experiences of the players in their lives as they unfold.  While it is fiction, to me it is a great example of how historical fiction can make events of the past much more understandable and fascinating. It is accurate while just not statistical as in a history text book.  I couldn't wait to read the next selection in the trilogy.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is an enjoyable book about an English couple, who have grown apart but find their love for each other when he goes out to mail a letter and keeps walking. It made me want to sign up for a walking vacation in Great Britain. Harold had quite an adventure along the way.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This Star Trek series is the something that will never end.  This movie tells it from the start, how they all meet and how they become friends that will last forever even after they are gone.  I highly recommend this Movie for all Star Trek fans and If your not a Star Trek fan watch this movie and you will be.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|A bit of a cult TV show. Ms Hewitt has a full wardrobe of skimpy outfits. It's odd and sometimes creepy but I like it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Good graphics. plenty to do. might be more difficult for kids under 10. great game without having to spend money.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This show was recommended by coworkers.  It has turned out to be a good show to watch.  Looking forward to the next seasons.
193700788X|5.0|Good mystery, lovable characters and an ending true to Sookie's persona. I felt this was a very appropriate way to wrap up the series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book, but obviously the bridge between books 1 and 3. Some good twists and turns in the story too.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have been a Star Trek Fan what seems to be all my life. When I was young I would never miss it.  I own all the Original movies, that is with the original crew. I wanted the complete Series for my collection.  My family is planning a Star Trek Weekend real soon on (a holiday weekend) so when we start on Friday night we can watch until we complete the series.  I love the way this collection is packaged, the way they are protected in individual plactic covers, not jjust paper sleeves, also the extra movies included was a great addition.  I highly recommend  this product.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This will let you scan something or take a picture of it from an angle and correct it to rectangle like you took it head on and it is very easy to use.  I love it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|HOT, HOT, HOT!!! I wish It would have continued. It's going to be hard to wait till the next story of Gideon and Ava...
B004P2HMNM|4.0|It completely met my expectations!!! The house has a toilet under the stairs!!! You can't imagine the surprises you could find in this Lego....!!M
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played on my Kindle Fire! It becomes difficult as you progress and the coins and gas are extremely helpful. You can continue to buy and upgrade for your vehicle and scene.
B0086HGW42|4.0|Dunno if I have the genre correct, but the music is encompassing and lyrics sing to my soul.  Ed Sheeran can host my party!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. What more could u ask for. Its free!!! Totally worth the wait of the download. I have been jealous of my friends having it for their smart phones. But now it's come out for kindle and I am as happy as any get out!!
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|Paramore as we know it is dead. With Hayley's songwriting partner gone (lead guitarist Josh Farro), as well as the departure of their dynamic drummer (the slugging Zac Farro), this band has no choice but to take on a new identity.<br /><br />Taylor York takes Josh Farro's songwriting place, but it's bass player Jeremy Davis who steps up and gives a huge personal performance, introducing an r&b groove that's an acquired taste to rock fans but nicely done.<br /><br />This album is more of a new alternative record -- you can hear colors of the yeahyeahyeahs and newer Tegan and Sara. There's danceability, really strong lyrics in spots and very strong vocals. But Paramore is pop-punk and this record is not.<br /><br />At first I was confused as to why they self titled a record to identify a gutted band, but I guess it was to make an example that they didn't quit on Paramore.<br /><br />With Tegan and Sara moving towards sentimental groovy rock, and Taylor Swift coming more towards alternative music, I'm not ready for Hayley to get away from her high-energy, biting intensity. She definitely leaves a void.<br /><br />Highlights (in track order): Fast in my Car, Daydreaming, Ain't it Fun, Still into You, Proof
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on a daily based! It is just like the website, I would highly recommend it for download.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Raw, and evocative. Characters you become friends with, sex and passion you wish you were having, happy there's book 2 at hand :)
B007WFR0QS|5.0|A nice voice to cross the Atlantic to smoke the lounges and theaters with her voice and lyrics....<br />To compare her to anyone would only lessen the value of her vocals at the very least you should buy one of her songs so you hear for yourself why it is worth the price of an album.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The writing is meant for all ages and as such It was kind of slow and predictable at times...<br />But I did enjoy it right up to the climactic moment near the end, the bit that followed was some how weird and a bit of a downer...<br />I think what I liked about it most as I went along was the slow unveiling of a rather bizarre reality and that a lot of little clues were dropped throughout that tied in later... this made it engaging...<br /><br />The only thing that continues to bother me, and I'm dancing around giving things away, is there was a bit of an incongruity in the &#34;End Game&#34; (if you will) with the roles played by certain characters that were earlier associates of the protagonist. I think they will change that scenario for the film.<br /><br />Finally &#34;Card&#34; himself defends the story against earlier critics who don't believe even genius children would think and act as these kids do. And I call his defense a success. What I think is a truer criticism is that even if they did.. Adults would never allow them to be put in these situations....but then again it was all super secret military stuff so Who knows???? MAYBE IT'S ALLL REEEAL???<br /><br />So read it and decide for yourself
B00CFITJKW|1.0|When I try to land there is like a black hole and i fall into it. I mean a plane is for flying not stricken go under ground and blowing up. Overall opinion game sucks
B00C2IFMO2|4.0|This book was  bought as a Christmas gift.  I have not read the book.  When you have a stellar cast in a movie ; I can suppose that the original material in this book would be meticulously crafted,
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|While I found the idea excellent, and I'm sure lots of people have thought about this one. I have. It didn't really have a point except that we are different in each lifetime, and possibly connected to the same people over and over again. I kept waiting for something, but it never happened.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Joyful, funny & incredibly well written. The Rosie Project will appeal to everyone, whether a literary snob or a chik lit fiend - it has it all! Highly recommended.
B009K0OL06|4.0|I like this television show. My dad bought it without me knowing...it is really good. I wish abc would show more episodes. the whole season is expensive. Cate needs to learn to spell.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the BEST!!!! Me and my best friends get together about every week or so and play on multiplayer. It is totally worth the money and i love getting all the new updates when they come out! Definitely get it you will not regret it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The story was A beautiful picture of repentance, it was heart wrenching tearing at the innermost human feelings of compassion and love. The music was simply &#34;addicting&#34;, and stuck in my mind for days. I never cared for operas, but this ranks as one of the two best...the other being Phantom of the Opera.
B0019T7PC2|4.0|I am fond of Disney films in general.  Like the rest of you I have my favorite stars, Robin Williams always tickles my funnybone.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Just a chalk this up as another great one by Daft Punk. So easy, refreshing and rock steady.  Definitely pick this up.
B0054NQZ9S|3.0|Good movie for our times.  I am a tommy lee jones fan and enjoyed seeing him in this movie.  Would recommend.
1781162646|5.0|I knew I was in for it when I read, \\"both the best and worst autumn of my life\\". Everything ceased to exist for me from that point on. \\"Joyland\\" just sucks the reader into a vortex and spins totally out of control until the end. This is the only one of Steve's books that made me bawl like a baby.<br /><br />I'm glad writing is now Mr. King's drug of choice because reading what he writes is mine. He never fails to surprise me. I don't care why he writes, just that he does.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Ok, at first I thought that is was a scam, but it's not. You can do so many things, give yourself diamond supply and much more! Just a suggestion- skins and textures.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Fun until it gets boring. The simple play mechanic works well but the repetitive nature of the game eventually wears it down. Great looking, well programed and worth the time.
B00C4Y4434|4.0|So for me personally, the wave 2 picture day dolls have so far been pretty hard to find at retailers. I have been scouring Target, Wal-Mart. etc, to no avail. So imagine my surprise when I found a lone Lagoona on the shelf at Toys R Us last night. Without a second thought I grabbed her up. Her hair this time is long, down to her waist, and predominantly yellowish blonde with blue streaks. It has a slight waves/curliness to it and a piece of her hair in the front is pulled over to the side. She has very pale pink eyeshadow at her lashline, with a darker hot pink along the crease of her eye, and iridescent glitter along her browbone. Her lips are a very light pastel pink. For accessories she wears a translucent yellow tentacle earring in her left ear, and a translucent pink rope and shell earring in her right ear. On her right wrist is a gold bracelet made of little connected balls, and her left wrist has a thin pink bracelet. Her dress is done in an A-line shape. The material has a teal backround with a print of pink orange and chartreuse coral and black fishbones and seahorses. The bodice of the dress is done with a shiny iridescent coral colored material. It has a little bow on the front that is shaped to look kind of like seashells (like the bra Ariel wore in the little mermaid). There is a thin iridescent ribbon tied around her neck and a lime green tulle ruffle at the hem of the dress. She wears a black fishnet short sleeve shrug over the dress. Under the dress, she wears some super cute capri leggings. The are bright pink with shiny silver dots all over them that make them shine and sparkle. Her metallic gold \\"rope\\" belt is adorable, and probably my favorite accessory of this particular doll. She carries a pink purse which is reminiscent of a sea urchin or anemone with a yellow seaweed strap. Her wedge slides are translucent teal blue and made of different size \\"bubbles\\" all stuck together. The wedge heel has some adorable little cutouts as well. She comes witha seafoam green folder/portfolio that actually opens up. It has a fishscale motif molded in the front as well as a little seahorse at the closure. Her included fearbook has a sheet of 16 mini stickers that show various monster high students in their best fearbook pose. It also has pictures of the staff, an autograph page with signatures of her classmates, and a group pic. She comes with a black stand and black brush.

B000FVE3BG|5.0|The quality of the watch is instantly evident.  The brass with the brown band, and the blue face are striking.  A real attention getter.<br />The embossed &#34;Invicta&#34; insignia on the case side is just plain classy.  And the price is mind boggling. Looks like a $700-$1,000 watch, but only $100.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This was a textbook for an introduction to meditation class I took at school. Since then I have reread the book and passed it on to some friends. Even if you are not interested in meditation it is an interesting read with some basic ideas about how to work your way through life with less stress. Although it never said that in the reading and meditation isn't about getting rid of stress I found it to do that for me.<br />Also it is a quick read so if you don't like you didn't really waste any time.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The movie I guess was alright, not the worst movie I have ever seen. It was slow had a couple of funny points but basically dragged throughout the whole movie. I would say save your $3.00.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The movie was as good as Ponyo.  I was not disappointed.  However, I was disappointed that item was sold as new but it had been opened and rewrapped.  I know this  because when I tried to download the Disney movie code, it told me that the code had already been used.

1609611543|3.0|First, I gave this book an \\"OK\\" rating because I think, for people with either Celiac Disease and/or other sensitivities to wheat and starch, it offers some good information and the recipes in it and in the later cookbook appear to be vastly superior to the gluten-free products found in the grocery store.  Now on to my three issues with the book.  I'd label all of these issues as examples of gross over-generalization.<br /><br />First issue: Good experiences with wheat.  There are people like me who have been consuming lots of grains for many years without a single one of the problems or symptoms he mentions.  I'm 75 and have been eating lots of whole wheat bread, brown rice, corn bread, and other grains since before I was 30.  On a grain-rich diet I'm as regular as clock work.  At times I eat crusty white bread soaked in olive oil or true southern buttermilk biscuits but, two days on that, and my body tells me I need to get back to the fiber-rich stuff.  I frequently \\"bread\\" liver with raw wheat germ before frying and if, every two or three years, I get a mild case of heart-burn or indigestion I'll just consume 2-3 tablespoons raw wheat bran, washing it down with water.  Problem solved without a trip to the medicine cabinet.  In the interest of full disclosure he should have included a few stories such as mine.  I've eaten tons of grains during the past 35 years and, to the best of my knowledge, I'm as healthy as I was when I started.  95/57 BP.  No arthritis.  No digestive problems.  Regular as clock work.  No medications of any kind.  Normal blood sugar.  Yes, I'm 20 pounds heavier than I'd like to be but hard to lose weight when you love your own friend chicken and lard biscuits.  Anyway . . . don't over-generalize Dr. Davis!<br /><br />Second issue:  It may not be the grain but the way the bread is made.  He does mention that both milling and baking techniques have changed a great deal in recent years.  But, to the best of my knowledge, he does not mention theway bread was made prior to the discovery and commercialization of yeast (turn of 20th century).  There is certainly not an index item for \\"Sourdough\\" in either of his two books.  Long, slow, acidic fermentation at a cool temperature does amazing things to dough.  (Many commercial \\"sourdough\\" breads don't really count.  Their fermentations are neither slow nor cool and sometimes yeast is added.)  It is the opinion of many that the genuine sourdough method de-natures many of the elements of wheat that Dr. Davis finds offending.  Not only that but people with some or all of the various negative reactions to wheat seem to tolerate sourdough without any problems.  I don't eat a lot of sweets and, if I do, I can feel the sugar high.  Whole wheat bread in general and sourdough in particular (even the white stuff) does not give me any of those feelings.<br /><br />Third issue:  Glycemic load.  (For a description of \\"Glycemic Load\\" and reasons why it is superior to \\"Glycemic Index\\" as a method of rating the impact of starches on blood sugar see \\"Eat Drink, and Be Healthy\\" by Walter C. Willett, M.D.)  Barry Sears in \\"Enter the Zone\\" made the same mistake that Dr. Davis makes.  He used the glycemic index alone to label particular foods \\"bad\\".  Sears said the humble carrot's glycemic index was too high for us to regularly consume it.  But in this, as in so many other things, context is all important.  Carrots do, indeed, have starch that digests rapidly.  It's glycemic index is 47.  But carrots have only 1/3 the carbs of an apple so it ends up with a glycemic load of only 6 (compared to the apple's 15).  (Multiply the carbs in a given food by its glycemic index - a % figure - and you get the glycemic load.)  Whole Wheat bread has a high glycemic index (71% relative to the 100 for pure glucose) but it only has 13 grams of carbs.  Let's do the math:  .71 x 13 = 9.23 glycemic load.  A glycemic load of 10 is considered low and that's when you looking at bare, naked bread.  Now, inmy experience, not too many people eat naked bread.  A few toppings come to mind:  Mayonnaise, butter, olive oil, peanut butter.  We could go on and mention things like cheese or tuna salad but the mayo, by itself, will make my point.  If you chew your food at all it is not going to enter your stomach as distinct items that are neatly isolated from each other.  So to find out the  glycemic load of the bread and mayo in your stomach you are going to have to consider the impact of fat on digestion.  It slows things down.  I'm not sure what the math is to do that calculation but just know that it is now going to be an average of the carbs in the bread plus the carb-free mayo (if it is \\"real\\" mayo!)  If the whole wheat bread you eat is sourdough then you are probably going to have an even lower glycemic index and, accordingly, lower glycemic load.<br /><br />Lest I fall into the over-generalization trap myself I want to note that, with the exceptions of the above, I think Dr. Davis' concern about the ubiquitous presence of grain starch in much of the prepared foods consumed today to be totally justified.  While good butter in a chocolate chip cookie will lower the glycemic load of the wheat starch present in the cookie, it will do nothing to de-nature the anti-nutrient elements of wheat and, so far, I've not seen a recipe for a sourdough chocolate chip cookie!  But, unlike butter-rich cookies, there is nothing in low-fat products to balance out the grain starch and, of course, no processing method to neutralize the anti-nutrient elements of wheat.  (Soaking or souring is suggested by some as a way to achieve this neutralization but I've seen reports that suggest such a method isn't nearly as affection as sourdough fermentation and, in many instances, it isn't either practical or, from a culinary point of view, satisfactory.)  The highly refined and finely ground grain starch that makes its way into so many prepared foods really is a problem for all of us and not just the gluten-challenged.  For me, cold cereals are a problem.  No matter how \\"natural\\" or \\"whole grain\\" they might be, I always find myself at the mercy of the sugar roller coaster which Dr. Davis mentions.  The problem, I think, is that, unlike bread, it is hard to add fat to a cold cereal - no way to compromise the starch of these thin morsels made from finely ground flours.  (Yes, I have usually added raw walnuts to such cereals but it would probably take a lot more walnuts than I typically use to achieve a balance that would work well for me.  The presence of fruit also deserves some of the blame!)  Cooking and eating intact grains (as one would rice) solves this problem for me and especially if I eat it hot 'cause at my house hot cereal always gets a pat of butter!  In any event, I think Dr. Davis' suggestion of using alternative flours in such things as pancakes, muffins, and cookies to be a great idea.  Flax, almond, coconut, and garbanzo bean flours would probably work in such items and I intend to give them a try - just as I intend to try some of these to \\"flour\\" my chicken before frying it.  I am sorry Dr. Davis was not discriminating enough to suggest that in such things as pancakes, muffins, biscuits, and cookies - in recipes where there is fat to lower the impact of the starch - that corn, millet, rye, and buckwheat flours work almost as well as wheat flour and, in some instances, better.  I much prefer corn meal pancakes to their wheat counterparts.  It is, however, rather hard to find whole grain corn meal although one can order such things from Amazon.  Unless one is going to replace wheat flour with a whole grain replacement then I think one's best bet would be to use Dr. Davis' alternatives.<br /><br />I want to share a story I came across many years ago - a story about the value of grain fiber.  A doctor who did some of his work in the rural parts of southern Africa where the diet contained a large amount of porridge made from hand-crushed grains isreported to have said that \\" . . . the larger the stools, the smaller the hospitals\\".  I lived for a while in a rural village in southern Africa and observed for myself that the people who lived mostly on millet or sorghum with bits of meat and vegetables from time to time were lean and healthy.  That they mostly walked anywhere they wanted to go didn't hurt either but their diet wasn't their enemy.<br /><br />It isn't surprising to me, then, that, looking at grains in light of the glycemic load, the Harvard School of Public health has used whole grains (along with healthy oils) as the base of its \\"Healthy Eating Pyramid\\" - see the Willet book mentioned above. I want to conclude with the suggestion that before you embrace the \\"Wheat Belly\\" diet prescriptions you read Willet's book first and then decide what's best for you.

B009NY43NY|3.0|All the other books in this series was filled with excitement. This being the last book of the series I was anticipating this one to be the books of all books. This was the worst written one yet. I am glad this was not the first one in the series because if it was I would never have read the rest. I was really disappointed and still left wondering!!!

B00138J342|5.0|Personally I thought that 10 was the best Pearl Jam effort out there, but that is my opinion. That said, Vs is very close behind. Great music in the way only Pearl Jam can come up with. To me, they have a little piece of the market cornered, kind of a niche. There are a lot of bands that try to sound like Pearl Jam, but just fall short. This album is a good example of that. The music isn't predictable, it doesn't become old after a few times of listening and it is one of those that I always come back to when everything else becomes old.

0061122416|4.0|Lots of books and movies talk about destiny and how to either find it or avoid it.  Examples include the recent Harry Potter franchise, along with the numerous comic book serials of the past century, with Superman probably the biggest one dealing with destiny.  Many of these works are long, featuring a long list of characters good and bad.  This short book however tells the search for treasure and destiny in one tight story.  Centered in the Mediterranean world just prior to the Industrial Revolution, the story follows the life of Santiago, a boy who leaves home and is induced to travel abroad in search of treasure.  Along the way he meets characters he teach him about destiny, and how looking for one can often divert you away from the other.  The book's prose is easy to read, easy to understand, and quite good.  The plot is engaging, and the dialogue is straight-forward, yet inspiring at the same time.  Overall, a very entertaining book.
B0019HQIGS|4.0|The DVD shows JM and his groups during their concert in LA. it showcases Johns depth and ability to fluently navigate through three (3) genres. The Product arrived very fast in good condition.

B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|I'm watching this on On-Demand now and I'm very disappointed. It moves too fast, the acting is a little too over-the-top and I just can't get into the story or believe any of it. It's also really easy to tell what's coming up next. And as much as I like James Franco, this is not the right part for him. Also, I don't like the main character at all--he's nothing but a womanizing, fake jerk. Honestly, it's all just too fake to make a good movie. While some parts are very nice visually, it's not worth more than 2 stars. Not enjoyable at all.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love the CD, especially the music from Paramore.  It's my kind of music.  I couldn't get enough of it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't used this app a lot, but it has come in very handy on several occasions.  It is a great one to have available on your tablet when you need it.  It is easy to use so I would recommend it to anyone.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|This game not only doesn't work, but has a virus or something. My kindle is new, had no problems before downloading this, and once I downloaded this, everything on my kindle went screwy. I had to totally reprogram it! Have tried this several times, with same result. Don't download this!!!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Graphics show clear line from set to cgi. Storyline was really predictable and no unexpected buildup. Book to movie was badly written, especially Radagast the Brown, (thrown in like the book is some kind of big joke) Acting was transparent. All around disappointed. Very amazed so many people liked this trash.  Thank goodness Tolkien is not around to see this.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Story does not live up to the previous Die Hard movies.  A little too unbelievable how he and his son survive all the things that happened to them.<br /><br />It is, however good entertainment, exciting car chases, and always fun to watch Bruce Willis do his thing.<br /><br />Inspite of its shortcomings, it is worth watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good story line. It has everything in it. Romance suspense sex. Love these books. Definitely recommend these great books.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|worst app ever after it goes through its mumbojumbo it just keeps closing on needed worst app ever DONT GET THIS APP EVER IN UR LIFE
B008CP6RWU|5.0|It is very good that they included extra games for this title. Its more of an &#34;experience&#34; than an actual game... in my opinion. Very different, and very beautiful! Kudos for developers who go out of the box and try something fresh! It's not for everyone, but for a select few.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love the alarm clock, and that it's a free download. Plays my music and everything. Will still work if kindle is off.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Sub way surfers is ok.I don't really like it.it's hard to get keys and flamingos so it's almost impossible to unlock new outfits.I think you should make the game a little easier. I got this game on Amazon. It's hard to get characters who you get there things from mystery boxes to unlock them.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a great rotating cover and works very excellently. It keeps the Kindle ready to go and is great for my reading!

B00005ABTT|1.0|Maybe its my fault but I did not see that the movie was Region 2 which cannot be played in my area. I don't understand why we have to have all these region stuff. A DVD should be a DVD!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game..I also play it on facebook. I only wish there was more energy. I need more friends.
B000002OTL|4.0|There is a vast variety of musical genres on this disc, and I loved them all... not to be listened to with the kiddos due to a few clips from the movie with movie director QT's pinchant for profanity flowing out of the speakers, but with todays techie devices, I easily editted it for the whole family to enjoy.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Movie wasn't exactly a train wreck. There were enough creepiness to keep me from stopping it, but I was very disappointed in the ending. Felt rushed.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|excellent movie very good adaption of the book ---has some VERY slow parts and remember that  the 100 page book is now multiple movies, at issue ( for me at least ) the main characters were a bit difficult to warm up to ---didn't have a lot of interest in them  ( as opposed to lord of the rings ---characters were almost immediately embraced and liked )
B009X01FJS|5.0|Kindle snaps in securely, easy to swivel from horizontal to vertical viewing.  Case is very well made, sturdy and attractive.  I'm extremely pleased with it.
B0031R5K72|5.0|This book is extraordinary on so many levels. And it's these layers that subtly convey the complexity that life as a ordinary german in Nazi driven WWII meant.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I picked up Gaslight Anthem's album \\"Handwritten\\" a while back and loved it so much, I had to get this one as well.  While I like this album very much, \\"Handwritten\\" is just on another level.  G.A. just really stepped up their game so much on \\"Handwritten\\" that it's a little hard to not be mildly let down.  If I had heard \\"59 Sound\\" first, I would probably be more impressed.<br /><br />G.A. is such a great band ... fast, high-energy, edgy, punk-tinged tunes that remind me of The Ramones, but never come across as being thrashy.  These guys also remind me of Dropkick Murphys but with better song craft, better musicianship and without all the excessive screaming.<br /><br />It's nice to have songs that are more sophisticated than three-chord punk while still retaining some of that throwback punk vibe.<br /><br />\\"The 59 Sound\\", \\"High Lonesome\\" and \\"Meet Me By The River's Edge\\" are all standouts for me but \\"Old White Lincoln\\" \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\" and others are all thoroughly enjoyable as well.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book I can say is one of the best classics I have ever read at the age of 13.it was full of romance and was never very predictable. Little Women had its joy and its sorrows but I will guarantee that it will make you cry at some parts and cheerful in others. You just fall in love with the characters meg, Joe, amy, and little Beth and their unofficial brother Laurie. I encourage you to read this book that I can proudly add to my list of classics.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Was looking for a fun, action packed movie and I got it. Lots of action with some humor.Just an overall good movie!

B000GIXIGY|5.0|After re-discovering this gem I can't stop listening to it.<br />Annie Haslam has one of the greatest voices in the history of music.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Great game so far. Gamboling lol. Sometimes the moving gets stuck especially on the main map until you get used to it. You can't save until the crystal grants you its light. Before then, if you die before you have to start over unless you turn off your kindle before you die. People are complaining about the money. Theyre so greedy blah blah blah. You guys are greedy. Give them more moneys so they will make more. If you cant afford it play it somewhere else. Complain about how you cant save 15 bucks. Complain about how you need to write negative reviews when you think every app should be under 10 dollars. I make only 300 bucks every 2 weeks and you dont see me complaining. Though i guess I am about the reviews lol. I cant wait for them to release more.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This group sounds like a current take on old Rusted Root.  The song craft and musicality of this band are solid.  They deserve much more attention than what they are getting.  This is a great road trip album that will keep you singing along and tapping your steering wheel.  The sound clips you listen to here on Amazon are an accurate representation of what the complete songs sound like, so don't worry about buying the album and being disappointed.  That the band shares vocal duties and incorporates a variety of instruments and playing styles makes the album very diverse so none of the songs sound the same.  It's the type of album you can listen to over and over again without tiring of it.    Revo:  A nice intro. Upbeat, energetic and really sets you in the right mood for enjoying the rest of the album.    Red Hands:  This is one of the best road tripping songs on the album.  I dare you to listen to this song on the highway and not bob your head.  Lyrics are great on this song as well.    Gang of Rythm: I'm not a Disney movie fan, but this song has a vibe that seems like it would be a perfect match for the Lion King or some other animated nature/animal show.  It's not a cheesy or juvenile pop sounding song - it just sounds like something that would fit a movie scene of a group of critters walking through the jungle or mountains and grooving together.  However, when I'm jamming to this tune, I also get images in my head of kicking it around a campfire with good friends and good beverages - simple pleasures in life... enjoying good company, good music and good times.    Speeches:  Not a bad tune, but also not stellar.  This is a nice appropriate break from the sound of the first three 3 songs.  Kind of \\"Mumford and Sons\\" vibe.    Sometimes:  Another departure from the sound of the first few songs, but a more compelling tune than \\"Speeches\\".    Shake:  Sarah's voice is perfect on this tune.  Especially coming on the heels of \\"Sometimes\\" and the rest of the first 5 songsthat are all predominantly male vocals.  Again, it breaks things up and keeps the sound of the album fresh as you progress through it.    Somebody That I Used to Know:  This is better than the original by Gotye.  Replacing the electronic sounds of the original with creative acoustic instrumentation is brilliant and makes the tune appealing to a broader audience.    These Times:  A catchy tune, but awfully repetitive.  Not up to the level of many of the other songs on the album but it's good enough I don't find myself skipping over the track.    Summer Vibe:  Personally this is my least favorite song on the album.  I can listen to it, but it's a little too Colbie Caillat for me.  Sarah's voice saves it for me... barely.  Again, I don't find myself skipping over it, but it is a tune likely more appealing to teenage girls.    Money Tree:  Mediocre at best.  Next to the last song on the album, they could have done something stronger.    No Ulterior Motives:  A decent end to what is, for the most part, a great album.  I find myself tapping my foot to this tune and imagining kicking it on a tropical beach in the sun with a fruity drink in my hand.  The lyrics are a little sappy for my taste so I ignore them and just groove to the melody.    This album really kind of seems to taper off in the 2nd half.  That's the only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars for me.  It comes across sounding like they got tired and complacent after having so many great songs at the front end of the album.  However, it's obvious this band has tremendous potential for a long career and devoted fan base.  I hope they step up their game for the \\"entirety\\" of their next album.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I went into this movie thinking it would be another Twilight kind of movie. But it had more humor than I expected and a touch of action. Nice story, so guys shouldn't be afraid to watch this one with their significant others.

B007SPN5MA|5.0|Best kept musical secret of 2012, Glen Hansard (&#34;Once&#34;, The Frames, The Swell Season) has completely come into his own with a solo album that rivals the high tide points of the Oscar-winning &#34;Once&#34; songs!  It's so good, you don't pick a favorite, you end up with 5 or 6 favorites!!  Must have if you liked &#34;Once,&#34; you like Irish folk-rock, or you like Van Morrison or Cat Stevens and want to see who is doing new music like that.
B000GCFD72|5.0|There is nothing in this book that I disliked or disagreed with! Essentially, take true anarchist principles in tandem with the non-aggression principle, apply them to parenting and you get unconditional parenting theory. In other words, do not be a ruler over your child, do not be aggressive or accusatory; Work -with- them instead of do -to- them, not taking punitive actions (not only because punishment does not work, because it is also immoral), but showing them how to be compassionate, altruistic, empathetic, encouraging their curiousity (instead of diminishing it) and constantly making sure that they feel unconditionally loved and supported. I feel like if I could only read one parenting book, it would be this one.

In particular, those responsible for corporate governance realize that they must take practical steps to eradicate such practices, including the new offence of failing to prevent bribery.<br /><br />Avoiding legal risks such as these requires firm action and therefore is no easy task, especially within a large and complicated corporate structure.  Fortunately, practical help and guidance is at hand via this informative and revealing new book recently published by Globe Law and Business.<br /><br />The book is referred to quite rightly as `a unique book from a unique group of contributors.'  There are thirty-one in all from a wide variety of jurisdictions and academic disciplines worldwide including, of course, consulting editors Stuart Weinstein and Charles Wild.  Generally speaking, the contributors as a group offer a combination of legal expertise matched by penetrating academic analysis.<br /><br />Interestingly, editors Weinstein and Wild -each with dazzling CVs -- lead the `Legal Risk Management Governance and Compliance' course at the University of Hertfordshire, the first and only such course, apparently, in the UK.  (Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Columbia offer such courses already.) `This text,' they say, `comes at a critical juncture in the recognition and acceptance of this area as a significant part of both legal education and practice at a national and international level'<br /><br />The book is designed to assist the informed professional on an incredibly wide spectrum of issues and policies involved in the development and implementation of a risk management and compliance culture with teeth. As the publishers point out, the book contains chapters on everything from board structures, corporate governance, fraud and bribery, arbitration, mediation, and data protection, as well as offshore and human resources issues - and we cite only a few examples here, of the book's comprehensive context.<br /><br />The book is divided, naturally, into three parts, with Part I covering legal risk management -- and matters relating to governance examined in Part II.  Chapters dealing with compliance in Part III are usefully grouped under bribery and corruption... health, safety and environment... human resources... information systems... process management controls... and regulated industries, specifically the financial sector.<br /><br />Writing in the Foreword, Lord Gold refers to the `real-world insights into risk management and governance' provided by this innovative title, together with cutting-edge research in the field. `This book will be useful,' he adds, `for any manager seeking comprehensive guidance as to how day-to-day risk, governance or compliance issues should be managed.'<br /><br />Outside advisers, in-house counsel, or indeed auditors or managers charged in any way with implementing enlightened compliance procedures within their organisations -- will welcome the practical and erudite guidance provided by this book.

Characterization is excellent; you're drawn into the film.....you're there. It's so realistic in so many ways. The humor is ....well, it'll have you in &#34;stitches&#34; sometimes. I hope they make a sequel to it but I'm not holding my breath. I highly recommend this film...but some language may be innappropriate for young children.

As the expert authors of this comprehensive practitioner's guide point out, `insolvency and restructuring experts have come to understand pensions... and pensions experts have begun to learn about restructuring, including cashflows and issues of wrongful trading'.<br />`Both areas of expertise,' they add, `are immense and the industry continues to suffer from experts in one area who lack understanding of the other'- the results often being uncertainty and confusion.<br /><br />Recently published by Jordans, this book aims to address these problems by indicating in a single volume the multitude of ways in which the two areas relate; thus providing the practitioner with much easier access to the law and practices in both disciplines. `It is hoped,' say the authors, that `practitioners can benefit from the clear understanding of the legalities and the practice in this growing area of work.'<br /><br />The first two chapters introduce the reader to firstly, insolvency law, and secondly, to pension schemes and pensions law.  The following chapters cover, respectively, preparing for insolvency, the role of the adviser and financial assessments and of course much more.  Chapter 6 aptly titled --`Negotiation with the Parties: A Cacophony of Competing Interests' - includes sections on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF); its obligations, powers and strategy, plus, in part, the duties of the employer, the creditors, the employees and the unions.<br /><br />Not only does the book cover the main issues, (including the financial assessments and necessary negotiations) but the many risks -- including regulator risks - and other pitfalls commonly encountered in these interlocking areas of law.  Note also that there is a chapter on international issues and the export of the Regulator's powers, with examples offered, including Sea Containers and Nortel Networks.<br /><br />For researchers, the book contains extensive table of cases, statutes and statutory instruments -- and thanks to the detailed table of contents, the index and numbered paragraphs throughout, the book is easy to use, especially for practitioners under pressure.  Another noteworthy feature is the glossary at the back with its detailed definitions of terms.<br /><br />If you as a practitioner are involved with matters where there are pensions' issues on a corporate insolvency, you really do need this book, which we would say is distinguished by the clarity and practicality of its approach.

0307946711|5.0|movie and book have such a sweet love story, while not losing the element of surprise. very great read! This movie stays true to the book and It was almost redundant (almost) to read the book after seeing the movie. either or, they are true to each other in accuracy, and this has such a unique love story, even though you at times want to stick you foot up Dexter's butt, or give him a good slap or kick because he is so narcissistic. There's a sweetness to him, but he waists an awful lot of time getting there!
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|1st of all, I want to apologize to all the people that help made this film because I didn't get it.<br />It was very confusing to me,  maybe I was a little sleepy or the film was so confusing, boring that made me feel sleepy. You get the point.<br />good that I got it from AMZN so I can return it and get some refund back. Got nothing but the best to say about AMZN.
1594744769|3.0|I was excited when this book arrived. I had high hopes when I read what other reviewers had to say about it. But to me it did not live up to the exceptions I had for it. It flows well and the characters are likeable enough. It was just lacking something, but don't let my review sway future readers of the book. After all you don't know if you like something until you try it.

B0002DB0FO|4.0|A few years ago, I was watching a very forgettable movie on cable, so forgettable in fact, that I can't even remember the name of it. This film did however have a tremendous teen actor, who I took note of, because of the charisma and intensity that he brought to his role. I thought this kid could one day be a big star and took note of his name, Gregory Smith. Since then I have become a huge Gregory Smith fan, seeing most of his films and now his TV show, Everwood. The story of Everwood begins when world famous neurosurgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams), loses his wife in a car accident. Distraught, Brown decides to leave his prestigious job and move his family from New York City to the small town of Everwood, Colorado, where he opens up a free medical clinic. Brown was a brilliant surgeon, but really doesn't have a clue about how to be a father. His children, in particular his son Ephram (Gregory Smith), does not make the transition easy on him. To be honest, this isn't the kind of show that I usually go for and I was only planning on watching a couple of episodes. A couple of episodes quickly turned into much more as this infectious group of people really drew me into their lives and touched me in a way that a TV show never has. Part of me could really relate to their personal struggles and attempts at overcoming the adversity they faced, if nothing else, It was empowering and inspirational. Veteran actor, Treat Williams, leads a truly terrific cast, playing the man whose turned his life upside down in order to get closer to his children. Dr. Brown is supposed to be the one who has all the answers, at the hospital, that may be true, but at home, it's a big learning curve for him. The dynamic between this quirky celebrity doctor and his introverted, yet artistic outcast son, is really the heart of this show. Gregory Smith is off the charts good as young Ephram Brown, who possesses many of the same qualities as his father. Those qualities are usually at odds with the qualities of his mother, causing him to be a bit impulsive and quick to speak his mind. Ephram quickly falls for the most popular girl in school, Amy Abbott (Emily Van Camp), who is the daughter of Everwood's first family. Amy clearly has feeling for Ephram, but a shocking secret that keeps her from getting close to him. Van Camp, now the star of ABC's Revenge, is asked to wear many hats, sometimes she's sweet and innocent, while at other times she's immature and irritating. but no matter the mood, she's always at the top of her game, really letting you feel, what Amy is feeling. Amy's father is Dr. Harold Abbott (Tom Amandes) who was the only doctor in Everwood, until Dr. Brown showed up. Abbott is arrogant, egocentric, and absolutely hysterical. Amandes brings some much needed comic relief to the show and his interactions with the other members of the cast are priceless. If it wasn't for Everwood being a WB show, Tom Amandes would have several Emmy Awards by now, because he really is that good. Everwood is a family drama that is at times hard to watch, because you will be deeply affected by these characters and at some point will be able to personally relate to what their going through. It pulls at the heart strings, that's for sure, but seeing that adversities faced by these characters and how they were able to over come them is really an inspiration. I said earlier that this is the kind of show that I don't usually watch, but it should be for the way it made me think and the way it made me feel.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Where did Lawrence come from and how has she done so much in such a short time?  The story is timely and worth considering (like why are there so many problems like this and why isn't more support?) and with De Nero in the mix, the prospects for success were pretty good.  But Lawrence makes it all work.  Let me pre-order her next movie.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book eloquently defines introversion but also honors and values those of us who are introverts.  Cain explains the subtle change from valuing character to valuing personality and the subsequent effect on introverts.  It has practical advise for introverts and those who deal with us. This book has great potential to enlighten extroverts about the habits, preferences and strengths of the introvert.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|If you were looking for unengaging fodder, you've found it.  This is not just a bad adaptation of Tolkien's story it is an entirely dull replacement story.  Their really isn't any story left.  It's just a bunch of filmmaking nonesense. Worth skipping it.  Seriously!  We stopped after only half of this film.  It was that dull.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I am not sure what audience Mr. Bordaine was aiming at, but it really wasn't me.  He would go on listing food in French, or speak about tools and terms only used in the trade with only a little explanation in a random chapter near the end.  It was a scattered euphoric recall of his career.  I was really interested and could somewhat relate to two parts.  The time he worked in the Rainbow Room.... How interesting to read that he might have been in the kitchen when my dear old dad took me there, and what craziness actually happened behind the scenes.... And his trip to the Tokyo branch of Les Halles.  I am left wanting to eat at Les Halles at some point, and to go back to Japan with the hubster to eat a ridiculous amount of fresh, still wriggling sushi.  Also, I read the entire book with his dry sardonic voice in my head. I am not even slightly tempted to read his other books, but I might watch another show starring this lanky Chef. Two and a half Stars.  On Goodreads, it's 2 stars, which means it was OK.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I was nine years old when this event took place, and had just moved from NY to NJ. I remember my parents and their friends talking so much about it. I saw the NY Times photos in my house on the breakfast table. I thought it was cool.<br /><br />I don't remember ever really thinking about it again, even when the towers were destroyed. But when I came across the movie on Amazon I was intrigued to find out 'the real story', and boy am I glad I did. What an amazing adventure, from his initial flash of inspiration, to his obsession to achieve his wirewalking dream, to his planning/practicing, and finally to his band of misfit (and I mean that in the kindest sense) accomplices.<br /><br />To see the behind the scenes story played out, with some very cool archival movie footage, really made the story come alive. Philippe himself is a giant among men, unable to see limitations. To witness his walk, to see the photos, to see the heights...... breathtaking is the only word that comes to mind.<br /><br />What kind of person would even think about doing this, much less actually do it? A man like Philippe, who lives his life to the fullest, and whose talents and physical and mental abilities put him a cut above. I am humbled to even have seen this story, it's just unreal that he not only pulled it off, but achieved it with the showmanship he always displayed in his performances.<br /><br />The dry humor, multiple points of view, and details of the planning make it that much more compelling to watch. Sure it would have been great to see more movie footage of the actual walk, but the stills somehow provided more feedback about the enormity of the scale and the incredible danger of the walk itself.<br /><br />Wow.

1451627297|2.0|The premise of this book was very intriguing, and I was really hoping that King would do it justice. Sadly he drops the ball by making the novel painfully long, full of sappy, poorly-written romance and unrealistic relationships instead of an interesting exploration of American history in the fifties and sixties. When King is in his wheelhouse building tension and providing flash moments of fear, he is excellent. However, when he lingers too long on relationships he is out of his element. There is very little of the former and much of the latter. King's folksy, corny dialogue is very unnatural and often sounds like it was written by a high school student. He could have overcome this weakness by examining in more depth what it would be like for a person to have the opportunity to witness famous figures and events from the past and learn about the lives of older family members and friends. Instead, the cloying, uninspired love story takes precedence, making the book feel like little more than a wasted opportunity. There are some moments of intrigue, and I did feel that I learned more about the people and events surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Beyond that, reading 11/22/63 felt like time poorly spent. For King fans only.

B0094AH3OI|4.0|Let me get my bias out right here from the beginning- I love this opera.  It is my favorite Verdi score after Traviata. It is filled with gorgeous arias and duets, and terrific chorus pieces.  In short, one great tune after another- and packed with emotional drama as well.<br /><br />I also have a good history with this opera.  Living in Boston, we have GREAT classical music concerts (especially early music-Baroque, etc) but NOT a great opera company.  Perhaps being only 4 hours from New York City has inhibited its development, but there is not a major opera group here, nor has there been.  So my opera viewing since its inception (about 15 years ago), was with smaller companies, venues, etc.  Finally, in 2004, my wife and I attended one of the great opera houses (Covent Garden) where we saw Forza.  Our first experience with opera in a major place- and it was overwhelmingly terrific.  (Violetta Urmana, Salvatore Licitra, Ferruccio Furlanetto) I was even able to get a bootleg audio of the performance as there was a radio broadcast.  What a great souvenir from a special night.<br /><br />So, this opera is special to me.  At this time I have 14 dvd's of this opera (including many boots- which are unreleased TV broadcasts).  How does this performance stack up to that list?  Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag- some excellent stuff (and performances) and some terrible things as well.  I will detail below.<br /><br />However, before I get there, I want to make some comments about the opera itself, since I am so familiar with it.<br /><br />This opera gets a bad rap, mostly for its libretto/story in that some incidents seem ludicrous or the coincidences are just too unrealistic, leaving the whole vastly diminished.  I will detail some of them, and make some comments on that as well.<br /><br />Leonora, daughter of the Marques of Calatrava, is awaiting her lover Don Alvaro, as they intend to elope, of course against the wishes of her father.  He bursts in on them before they flee, and confronts Alvaro angrily.  Alvaro draws his pistol, but does not intend to shoot her father.  Instead he gives himself up.  In the usual staging of it, he tosses the pistol onto the table in surrender, but it accidentally goes off and shoots her father killing him almost immediately (but not before he curses the two of them!).  (Note, I will comment on how that is staged here below.)  So, the opera begins with a major development that seems a stretch of logic.  BUT, without it, there is no story, so you must give the writer his leeway.  (The rest of the opera deals with the tragic consequences of this event.)  Also, two other points to make here-<br /><br />1) The opera is based on an early Spanish plan in which this is the key initial event;<br />2) Many other operas (including Verdis) have similar logical difficulties in their back story (read the plot summary of \\"Il Trovatore\\" for a start), so this is NOT unusual.<br /><br />Subsequent to the death of the Marques, there are several coincidences (accidental meetings of persons) that strain the logic further.  In the Act 2 tavern scene, Leonora (fleeing in disguise) ends up in the same tavern as her brother Don Carlo, who is trying to kill her in revenge.  (They do not actually meet, but being in the same place heightens the drama.)  In the major scene in Act 3, Don Alvaro saves the life of Don Carlo, whereby they swear soldier's loyalty to each other, each without knowing who the other really is.  The drama becomes almost excruciating when they discover the truth and engage in a duel (the first of two).  ALL accompanied by incredibly powerful Verdi music.  In the final scene of the opera, they resume their duel (off stage), coincidentally right outside the cave where Leonora, living the life of a repentant hermit to expiate her sins against her father, is located, which allows Don Carlo to stab and kill her in his final revenge, as the curtain falls.<br /><br />Again, these coincidences, and the developments of the plot (there are more) have been the major criticism leveled at this opera which, I believe, have prevented it from become more popular than it should be.  (The dvd includes a brief video summary in which it states that this is the 11th most performed Verdi opera.)  But I address these \\"deficiencies\\" in this way-<br /><br />1.  Many many other operas (including Verdi operas) have far more ludicrous plot developments or revelations regarding the history and relationships of characters (it is an opera staple that anyone thought dead is really alive, and that there are family relationships among the principals that completely change the story and its resolution.)<br /><br />2.  Here, these developments lead to HIGHLY emotional scenes and music that are exceptionally powerful.<br /><br />3.  Much of these developments come from the underlying Spanish play which was the source of the libretto.<br /><br />4.  The opera itself is specifically and consciously designed to highlight these issues- hence the name: \\"The Force of Destiny\\".  This is often overlooked, so I will elaborate on this point.<br /><br />Most Verdi operas feature strong, powerful characters who dominate the action and the other characters in the story.  (Too many to enumerate here.)  Verdi specifically wanted to create something different here- a story where the hand of fate is the dominating force, NOT the characters themselves.  Where \\"Destiny\\" is the all-powerful movant of the action- and for him to depict the human consequences of this.  Again, the title sets this out explicitly- \\"The Force of Destiny\\"- tells us what is really going on here.<br /><br />This is definitely something different (and not something that Verdi did again).  But it triggers the incredible music that makes the human drama so effective to us.  So, in short, look aside from these plot problems, accept them, and let the drama, and the accompanying music, take you to a different place than Verdi usually goes.  You will loveit.<br /><br />Now, let me discuss the DVD here- which, as I said, I found a bit of a mixed bag.  I'll start with the performances, which are generally excellent.<br /><br />I really like Aquiles Machado, going back to his first dvd [[ASIN:B0000C7PRD Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Esposito, Machado, Marrucci, Canzian, Schrott, Muus, Macerata Opera]].  A beautiful voice, and I think he handles the role of Don Alvaro very well, though another reviewer here really despises him.  Dmitra Theodossiou is a big star, with MANY dvd's to her credit.  She sings beautifully as Leonora, with great emotion and conviction.  Vladimir Stoyanov as Don Carlo and Roberto Scandiuzzi as Padre Guardiano are also very good. I particularly liked Carlo lePore as Mellitone, a big, hulking, helpless monk.<br /><br />As for the production itself, this is really where there are ups and downs.  The set is pretty bare- a slightly raised stage with these massive two walls that get moved around a bit.  No other stage furnishings at all.  In certain scenes (Act 1 in Leonora's home, Act 2 in the tavern) this doesn't work at all, and is quite ineffective.  But for the monastery scene in Act 2 (perhaps my favorite scene of the whole opera) it is quite visually effective.  The massive walls are moved alongside each other with a space in-between, and with a cutout above, you have the outline of a very large cross (see the cover of the dvd) with golden light shining out from behind.  Then, the monks come out carrying torches- very moving.  The final scene removes the walls entirely and has a large fallen cross with rocks (tombstones?) around it that works very well.  One final point (a minor one for me) is that the costumes are awful.<br /><br />Let me point out one instance where the poor sets really hurt the drama.  In the first scene, when Don Alvaro throws down his pistol in surrender (and it accidentally goes off killing Leonora's father), most stagings (like the Met's [[ASIN:B0009YBYSE Verdi - La Forza del Destino, Remastered]] ) have the pistol thrown on the table next to which the Marques is standing.  Not here- because there is no table (or any scenery).  So, he throws the pistol to the ground, and it goes off killing the Marques.  That certainly stretches the credulity of the scene!<br /><br />In general all of the scenes with the principals listed above are well staged, acted, sung, etc, and very enjoyable.  The real disappointment here are all the scenes with Preziosilla.  They are TERRIBLE!  She is meant to be a gypsy (fortune teller), follower of the military, and supporter of the soldiers.  It's a light, somewhat comic (flirtatious) role (think Beverly Sills in Fille du Regiment).  Here, it is extremely heavy handed, no joy whatsoever and is just a disaster.  (There is very little humor in this whole show except for Mellitone's feuding with the poor in Act 3.)<br /><br />So, if you ignore the costumes, all scenes with Preziosilla, and some of the early sets, much of the show is quite excellent- and really what is very good here is at the heart of this terrific opera anyway.  Not the best dvd, but still quite good.

Some of these stories are amazing, especially the part where the light bulb goes off when the realization occurs that, maybe, smoking was bad for you. The stories about the researchers seem miraculous. Research is all about slowly chipping away at a theory and seeing where it goes.<br />Terrific book for anybody who reads.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great time consuming game, if you enjoy this type platform. It is easy to upgrade your vehicles &amp; advance to additional stages.  It's challenging to improve on your score in each stage.<br /><br />The one downside I have with this game is that after about a week of play, you've purchased all vehicles with upgrades &amp; all of the stages (All in game credits, no actual money is required to progress along). After that, you really have nothing to aim for and you have loads of game money you can't spend on anything.  I say this but I don't know how you would change it other than adding additional vehicles and stages.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's still an enjoyable game and passes time quickly. Thanks

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Van Halen is about the only band that I can think of that came back with an album worthy of their classic sound and that was because they used songs that were written during their classic period.  This album is simply fantastic and fits in perfectly with the first 5 Sabbath albums.  I don't skip a single track on here.  Ozzy's vocals sound a bit too processed but that is about my only complaint.  The drumming and bass is perfect and of course Iommi's riffs are next level.<br /><br />I see some complaining that the mix is too loud.  Sure, it is, but not nearly as bad as most of the other rock/metal records that are released today.  The other complaint I see is that the album is too slow...  I just don't get this, what did you expect from the inventors of Doom Metal?  They aren't a thrash band.

Dumbo didn't deliver for us.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|The variety, contrast, and sounds in this album are classic Muse.  They once again showcase their outstanding musicianship and creativity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft PE! It is easy to build and destroy blocks. I like how it is pretty similar to the Xbox edition and the PC edition. It is also a great game for kids, teens, and adults. If I were you I would totally download it.
B001DDCVCI|5.0|This is a review of: At Folsom Prison Legacy Edition (2CD/1 DVD)<br /><br />Amazon,  you may want to give this special Legacy Edition its own review thread as it stands the comments are comming from the Vinyl, mp3, Audio CD  AND At Folsom Prison Legacy Edition (2CD/1 DVD) altogether. The CDs of which I write have more content than the original vinyl and the remasterd version CD of the that Album.<br /><br />What many people don't know is that on that day at Folsom Prison Johnny Cash gave two concerts: one at 09:40 AM and another at 12:40 PM. The 09:40 concert is the one put on the album most of us are familiar with. During the 12:40 concert you can tell right out that Johnny Cash had just given a previous concert as his voice is tired and he made more slip-ups--but still a good listen I think.<br /><br />\\"The show at Folsom in 1968 was a long one and I always thought that the the songs that were not on the album were as worthy of being heard as the ones that were.\\" --Johnny Cash: June, 1999 (Taken from enclosed booklet of the Legacy Edition).<br /><br />If you have the remastered uncensored Audio CD of this concert you should know that this Legacy Edition has in addition to the extra tracts a little more of Johnny Cash chatting and making remarks.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most is the  2 Hour and Ten Minute DVD. It is a Documentary and not a live film of the concert though you get plenty of live shots bw/color from other Johnny Cash concerts and audio snips of live interviews given by Cash commenting on the start of his career. Marshal Grant talking about the beginnings of The Tennesse Two and the old-times is priceless! W.S. Holland also puts in his memories of the early times with Johnny Cash. There are also interviews with Merle Haggard, Rosanne Cash, Marty Stuart and former inmates who saw the concert.<br /><br />The enclosed 39 page booklet includes photos by the Folsom Prison Concert photographer Jim Marshal --up to now unpublished.<br /><br />All in all I think this piece of history is a steal at ca. $28.00.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Don't be fooled by the presentation of this movie as being a surf movie. Yes, it certainly is built around a surfing theme, but it is a relationships movie. It is about a few peoples lives converging at pivotable moments in their life; how they overcome their fears of love and commitment,  opening up old wounds and healing. Then there's the wave - Mavericks, and the detailed teachings the experienced mentor gives to his young, ambitious, prot&eacute;g&eacute;e ; zen lessons that come with surfing and respecting the ocean. A great family movie for sure, perhaps too heavy for really young kids.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am not really a fan of science fiction, so I almost decided not to watch this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, when they movie was better than I had expected.  I didn't like the violence, but the story was done quite well, and I think that  we will be seeing much more of Jennifer Lawrence as an actress.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|\\"From Up on Poppy Hill\\" was definitely under my radar.  I am a Miyazaki fan and I eagerly await anything from this illustrious studio.  Yet somehow I missed the US theatrical release of this film.  I only discovered this Japanese language DVD on Amazon.  It is a film by Goro Miyazaki son of Hiyao Miyazaki the world's greatest animator.  The elder Miyazaki did contribute to the story but Goro is the director.<br /><br />One thing a viewer should understand, Japanese animation is not necessarily a child's medium.  This film touches on things your six year old will not understand.  This is a `PG' film not `G'.<br /><br />This is a period piece set in Yokohoma, Japan.  The year is 1963. World War II has been over for almost twenty years.  The current generation is coming of age.  With the Olympics coming to Japan in 1964, there is a huge push to show the world a new Japan.  It's time to set old things aside and usher in the new era.<br /><br />Umi  Matsuzaki is 16 years old.  She lives in an old hospital owned by her family overlooking the harbor.  Her medical professor mother is training in the US.  She lives with her grandmother, three borders and her younger brother and sister.  Despite the presence of the grandmother, Umi is the true head of household, preparing meals, doing laundry, keeping the books, etc.  Her one eccentricity is each morning, she raises maritime signal flags in a ritual honoring her late father, a supply ship officer killed during the Korean War.<br /><br />At her school, Konan Academy, she finds out someone has been watching her morning ritual when she reads an anonymous poem in the school paper.  It seems she has an anonymous admirer. On the campus of the school is a large old building called the Latin Quarter.  It is used by the boys of the school as a club house for their various extracurricular activities including the school paper.  The school's board is considering demolishing the building a move objected to by the Student Body President Shiro Muzunuma and his best friend Shun Kazama, son of a tugboat captain.  At lunch, the Shun performs a daring stunt seen by most of the students to promote their protest.<br /><br />In the instant he jumps his eyes connect with Umi.  While this can't possibly be the first time they see each other, it is the first time they really see each other.  A connection is made and it is the beginning of their romance.  But Shun is adopted and the story of his origin could derail this relationship before it really gets started.....<br />This is a Japanese film done in traditional hand-drawn animation.  It is absolutely beautiful. I really wish I'd seen this on a big screen.  Being forced to read the subtitles do not take away from the cinematic experience.<br /><br />There are cultural as well as temporal differences.  Remember this is a period piece.  The children wear uniforms to school.  The amount of detail is incredible. Light and shadow in the animation imitates life.  Shun's father stands at the wheel of his tugboat erect (like the former naval petty officer he'd been).  His eyes miss nothing and he turns the wheel with confidence and no wasted motion.<br /><br />Shiro is a subtle character.  He is a brilliant student academically as well as socially.  He runs the student body and misses nothing. Shun is his best friend and partner in all his endeavors.  The boys complement each other.  Shiro is cool, calm, caring but calculating.  Shun is bold, dashing and courageous.<br /><br />This relationship is best illustrated during a spirited student debate over whether or not to demolish the Latin Quarter.  It's also the most hilarious scene in the film.  Don't worry I won't spoil it for you.....<br /><br />The romance between Umi and Shun is the centerpiece of the film.  These are high school students in 1963.  There is latent sexual tension but that is not the point of this relationship.  This is the love we feel when we are happy just being together.  They are afraid to touch each other. But they hate to be apart.  Goro Miyazaki has his father's talent for romantic scenes.  Randomly meeting Umi on the street, Shun gives her a ride on his bicycle.  I know that does not sound like much but when you see it in the movie you will understand the emotional impact of this scene.<br /><br />Anyway I think I have written enough.  If you are looking for space aliens, car crashes or alien invaders this is not the movie you want.  However, if you want to see quality animation, intelligent characters that you grow to know and love and a great film, this is something you should see.

B00C061I3K|5.0|Veteran pop/rock/electro stars rarely get more popular as the years go on.  The ones who maintain the public's interest for as long as Daft Punk has have a tendency to feature the young, up and coming talent on recordings to attract their audiences.<br />Random Access Memories is by far the most anticipated record of the year, perhaps of the past 10 years.<br />But instead of collaborating with the up and coming, Daft Punk reaches into the past, the originators of hip.  Two tracks on this album feature musicians in their 70's, one of them whose biggest hit was &#34;Rainbow Connection&#34; by Kermit the Frog.  The album heavily features the guitar work of Nile Rodgers, whose guitar work has not been on the airwaves since the 70s.<br />Daft Punk is teaching the world to listen to an album again.<br />Respect to Daft Punk for taking risks, bringing the funk and defining hip instead of pursuing it.

B001NLL8LA|3.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher books are all great, but this one falls a little short.  Child's lengthy, too-detailed descriptions of New York City, hotel rooms, and other assorted places simply take up space and are a little too much for this reader to put together.  Most importantly, this level of detail is not necessary.  But, Reacher prevails, and his persona once again saves the day.  Still a good read, if you can put up with the detail.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this in a movie theater when it first came out, rented it once, and then had to buy it! I always enjoy movies that introduce me to other cultures, and this one did a wonderful job. The story line was delightful and thought-provoking. I thought, perhaps I like the movie so much because I've just arrived at &#34;retirement&#34; age; but both of my daughters said they loved it, too. It's definitely a keeper.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|my grandson loved it.  he \went to hte movie and loved the game.<br />the game is rivating and always entertaining..
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok. So, I read this book in a day and a 1/2. The first two books I couldn't stop talking about it with coworkers and the best lines are highlighted. But, this book ... nothing was memerable to me. Seems like this wasn't the original &#34;last&#34; book. There were a lot of filler plots, and not getting to Giddeon's dark side was bugging me. When will we learn more about him? Who cares that Carey is going to be a daddy? This book should be about Eva and Giddeon and it should've ended with this book. Stretching it out will just make the readers impatient and loose interest in the book. I will still buy the next couple books to get to the goods of the dark Giddeo Cross!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|If you are expecting Booth and Bones episode please be advised you won't find  it here. What you will find is a satisfying who done it with plot twists and turns, a cast of quirky characters and  interesting and educational clues and hints. Tempe`s forensic narrative is not for the faint hearted. In the end everything is tied up in a satisfying tale of who,where, when and why.
193700788X|5.0|Well, this is the end of the road for The Sookie Stackhouse Novels. I've read all the books voraciously and in hours after purchasing them in the past, but took days to savor the last book as I would a dear friend's last visit with me.  The characters all had closure and will remain part of Sookie's extended family, and trust.  The author outdone herself, and will remain one of my favorites, that I have gotten many of my co-workers reading and talking about the stories, and use me as the go to guy about the books.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|The total production, writing, acting, is well done.  A bit more excessive on the gushing blood scenes then would seem necessary to carry the story forward, but all in all the rest of the movie keeps me coming back for more adventures.
0425263924|5.0|Having highly anticipated Sylvia Day's newest release in the Crossfire series I can honestly say I was not disappointed! Having read most of the reviews on Amazon prior to receiving my paperback copy I was a little worried, but then I thought to myself I really don't care what other people say about things because I always go into something with an open mind.<br /><br />I LOVED this book! I think that both Gideon and Eva faced some major challenges at the of Reflected in You. Having said that I think they both came a long way in this book, communication and trust is still very hard for them but I in no way found either of them making major mistakes. I love how through all the obstacles they constantly face from almost everyone in their lives that they both still know there isn't another person in the world for them. I think that is what makes this book so special, because you can feel the connection they have with each other.<br /><br />\\"From the moment I first saw him-- saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside-- I'd felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself. I needed him like I needed my heart to beat, and he'd put himself in great jeopardy, risking everything-- for me.\\"<br /><br />While this might not be everyone's favorite part of the story I was finally happy to see Eva stand up to her mother. I don't think she acted childish when confronting the situation and she is slowly growing into her own independent person.<br /><br />I have heard that Sylvia Day has had a lot of backlash from readers about how the series is being stretched into two more books, and I personally have no qualms about this. I think that Gideon and Eva's story is too complex to squeeze into three books, if anything people should be thrilled we get to see more of Gideon!<br /><br />I think this is a phenomenal book and I can't wait to see how Gideon and Eva's story progresses from here! Sylvia Day is a fantastic author and I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed this book! I think it might even be my new favorite!<br /><br />5 out of 5 STARS!!nd I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed this book! I think it might even be my new favorite!<br /><br />5 out of 5 STARS!!
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I appreciated the Search function, but the number of times I had to sign into my Amazon account became ridiculous. At first it was once a month or so, but it became more and more frequent. After the eighth or ninth time, I uninstalled it and went to another product. Rated at two stars for irritation.
B008AT9XOC|3.0|Maybe the blu-ray release of this long-awaited disc is fantastic, but the DVD...the sound is horrible. I have to turn my TV up severely just to hear the movie, and most of the songs sound echoey. WTF? Then, when I turn on the bonus features, the sound is normal again. C'mon guys, give us a decent sounding dvd.
0375507256|3.0|Bought this book since the movie trailer looked intriguing. Never ended up seeing the movie, and instead read the book. It's kind of a puzzle book, and for the first half, you're interested in figuring out how this will all link up and be related. Then once you figure it out, it becomes a little less interesting. The book felt like it was going to have a Big Important Truth to convey, but in the end it was kind of ho-hum, simplistic, obvious sort of assertion it conveyed instead. It's worth a read, it's pretty good, but it's not some mind-blowingly amazing book. But maybe that's an unfairly-high bar to set for a book. It's pretty good. :)

B000WC39SG|5.0|This was a birthday gift. It's spectacular on Blu-ray and for about the price of a movie theater ticket you can own it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This album doesn't disappoint -- it's just as fun, catchy, and inscrutable as Vampire Weekend's last two albums. I particularly like &#34;Obvious bicycle,&#34; &#34;Step,&#34; and &#34;Hudson.&#34;
B00000JPH6|3.0|I first saw this film in a theater the day after Christmas, 1982.  I was so captivated by it that I saw it again a month later.  Unfortunately, subsequent viewings have worn off much of the fascination.  My admiration still remains with Brian Froud's marvelous designs, less so the story and its characters.  By its own admission, the story is only concerned with the dark crystal, the 3 suns, and the shard all getting together on a certain day, there is very little elaboration beyond that.  The quest for the shard is limited, the interchange between characters sporadic.  On the whole, this is a dry and joyless film.  It doesn't say much that the only well-thought out characters are buzzard-like creatures in fancy dress (the best of the lot being the whimpering chamberlain).  The rest are `sculptures' that move.  The Gelflings in particular are very expressionless (like plastic dolls).  Speaking of Yoda, Aughra is a poor substitute.  Again Yoda, when Jen's master is truly dead then gone, this smacks of plagiarism.  Also when a Skeksis cries out, \\"feel the power of the Dark Crystal!\\"  The Force is not with this one.<br /><br />Dark, grim, and way too somber, this is a sad piece I'm not sure I'd care to see again.

1451629192|3.0|I didn't see Jaycee's interview with Diane Sawyer but imagine for those who have, gave this memoir outstanding reviews. From a literary standpoint, I was not impressed. Jaycee had but a fifth grade education when she was taken and she tells this story in that arrested voice. She weaves her reflections in between chapters, in a voice coming to grips with trying to understand the past horrors, a voice now modulated through that of her therapist. There is a copy of a handwrtten journal she chronicles of her kitten, Eclipse, and in later chapters, shares typed journal entries describing her confusion, her questioning sense of self, but that also include thoughts that allude to her strengths, of her hopes for the future and the wisdom to know that the dysfunction lay with her captors. All in all it is a hopeful story, of someone with the capacity for loving the furred and feathered, her children, her family, and through the J A Y C Foundation, other families who suffered from similar, horrifying circumstances. This book is a five star for touching the heart.
B001DSNELA|5.0|If you are a 007 fan or a fan of Casino Royale this is the edition for you.  I only bought this because I watched my original 2007 copy of CR so much that I literally wore it out.  I was gonna get the same version, but since the original version is lacking in special feartures I decided to give this one a try.  The special features are a lot more extensive.  If you don't really care about the special features you could go with the 1 or 2 disk original.  But used, the 3 disk is about the same price anyway.<br /><br />The box comes with very stylish photos and information on the film.  The set also includes a pretty interesting book with trivia on filming and 007 history.<br /><br />Shipping blew my mind.  It arrived across the country 3 days earlier than the minimum arrival date.  Like I said, I bought the used copy and only paid $8.99 including shipping.  The used copy may as well be new.  Not a scratch is on any of the disks and they all play fine.  The actual box came a little worn, but I was more concerned with the quality of the DVDs.  Highly recommended.

B00CN8U60Q|4.0|Nice mix of medieval sounds and more modern sounds. The Rainbow song &#34;Temple of the King&#34; is nicely laid back in BM's style. Good Dio tribute. &#34;Carry on....Jon&#34; is one of the best songs Ritchie Blackmore has ever recorded.  Love the Jon Lord sounding keyboard near the end. A great tribute! The rest of the songs show good songwriting and musicianship skills that are lacking in most of today's pop music. If you're a Blackmore's Night fan, don't miss this CD. If you're just checking them out, try &#34;Ghost of a Rose&#34; or &#34;The Secret Voyage&#34; first. Carry on....

B003EY7IRC|5.0|This is a story I'd read over again. I kept expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised at the end. I loved the main character and she developed the strength she needed over the course of the story. I have to admit I didn't like her very much at the beginning of the series, but she got stronger. Wonderful character development!

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I am hoping I won't have to change my review, but so far I like what I see. It's a nice, light, compact and well designed unit. I have only had it a few days and have used it and it works good with no discernible loss of speed. My only concern is that in the instructions it says not use it with hard drives.  I have plugged in two external portable hard drives and it worked great on my Macbook Pro and iMac.  They were both detected and both went to sleep properly.  If I can't use this with my external drives when I travel then it is worthless, so we will see if it holds up.  It's not something I will be doing often anyway so it should work out fine.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.If you haven't seen it,I would highly recommend this movie.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What a nice book. Creative. Extremely intelligent. And a great read. After a long time (basically after Wool) have I found a book that one is compelled to finish in one go. For a new author, this is an amazing achievement - to get the perfect balance between details and a fast pace. The basic plot is also very interesting. Not being an 80's geek, I could not appreciate some of the finer points, but at no point did I feel that i could not adequately follow the story. I am eagerly waiting for his next work. Ash

B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is the third of Hosseini's books and I liked it very much but it didn't hit me as hard as his first two; The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. These books describe lives in Afghanistan over a wide range of years and political circumstances. They are not about wars or religion or politics...they are about people. Regardless of race or creed the human story speaks to all and this author does a marvelous job.
