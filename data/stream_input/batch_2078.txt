B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Bocelli was probably  \\"pushed\\" to do this album for commercial reasons. But he did a great job. It's so romantic, so nostalgic, especially  \\"love at Portofino\\".It takes me back to the time when I was young and in love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when it comes to games I am very picky. temple run provides that satisfaction I crave oh so much. temple run keeps me on my Ase for days I love it<br /><br />-Dre
B000T433L0|5.0|So good. Must watch film. De Niro is perfect. Amazing final scene. Believe everything you hear about this movie and watch it right now.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Quick, easy read. Interesting look at this intriguing world of memory contests. It also gets you thinking that you can do this, too! Perhaps not for competition, but how you may be able to use memory techniques to improve your memory and work/home life with names and faces, shopping lists, things on the &#34;to do&#34;  list a work...
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Ordered this movie because of the lead player but found out it was a really great story, well handled. I have the highest regard for the crew that put this film together.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my favorite sparks book. Cant wait for the movie. It keep me glued to the pages from the begining.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Was a good book, really falls well with the other two books in the series so far. Look forward to Hades Hall this Fall. I recommend this book to any fan of Rick Riordan
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|This movie is terrific because it let's you ride along with ordinary people going through a mind blowing experience.<br /><br />How would things go down if you and your friends were hanging out one night and the world around you completely fell apart?  Not from a birds eye, flashy Hollywood view, but the camera is on YOUR shoulder.<br /><br />I loved that it felt so real in how people reacted to events so outside of their scope of reality.  You experience them going through the stages of terror, mental shut down and then clinging to their sanity by grasping onto a goal that made sense in a world that had become unbelieveable.<br /><br />It engaged me by walking us with the characters step by small step through chaos.  Get out of the city- devastation at that attempt.  Then living from one meter to the next- hide behind car, next objective: make it across the street, next objective: go down those stairs...  it was so real- as real as a monster atacking a city can be- that's what's crazy about it.<br /><br />I didn't mind the over the top and random plot pieces like the army coming out of nowhere or them crossing highrises at the 57th floor- it worked and made that step in their journey more rich.  I just really enjoyed the experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i only truly liiked 2 books this year &#34;Gone Girll&#34; and this book. This author is so talented., and is more in the genre of The glass castle, The art of racing in the rain...ish

B006LSZECO|1.0|Got the sample read and just didn't get hooked so tried audible. Just kept falling asleep and going back to relisten. 5 stars for replacing ambien.
0802473156|4.0|Easy to read.  Don't agree on all.  Basically makes sense.  A little preachy, but it could be helpful in understanding how your partner views your loving gestures since we all don't agree on how to show love.<br /> Gifts may mean a lot or may mean nothing.  Partner may prefer some quality time vs some flowers or jewelry.  Makes you reevaluate how you're showing love to others and be more accepting or understanding how your partner is showing love perhaps by doing things for you, acts of service rather than say nice things to you or physical touch.  Unfortunately, we may not always understand how others demonstrate their love.  This book may help sort it out.
0385334206|5.0|Break fast of Champions book. You can get -lots of hard-to-find titles!  Great price, fast ship, highly recommend . A++
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My little girl loves this movie. Lots of bright colors and sounds!! Definitely recommend for anyone with small kids. Love it!
B005W0ARFQ|5.0|Great noir writing. Dark, but not too dark. Engaging character in Bernie Gunther. Provides insight into a fascinating terrifying time in recent history. Read all the series
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished watching the whole series, and now I get why there are over 4,000 reviews and why almost all of them give this series five stars as I did.  This is tremendous television- great writing, great ensemble cast, judicious use of special effects.  And Morena Baccarin is so beautiful it almost hurts to look at her.  I can't even imagine what the suits at Fox were thinking when they cancelled this outstanding show.  Thank goodness the cast was re-united for a feature film, which is also excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great follow up to the original. Fast and clean. Good look and fun game play. Just got a new character!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mars seeemms to be trying to kill our hero, but he is both lucky and very resourceful.  If was a fascinating read.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have found that Tunein Radio has good, clear sound, even for distant stations. The connections come quickly and smoothly. The variety of available stations is broad. A very competent and useful radio station!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is great! It really works when you want a puzzle (or two) to do. In my opinion, it is also a bit difficult, so the fact that it offers hints is a great feature. Overall, beautiful!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I can't say this was a great movie and I usually like everything time travel. But it's interesting to watch if you have nothing better to do.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great novel, Rick Riordan never disappoints! Book was just as fun to read as are all his god series books, will definitely read the next one!
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I could not put this down and in doing so miss a very important date.  I loved the plot and the characters.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|If you haven't read Pecks books, this would be a great one to begin with.  A rarely heard perspective on life so needed in today's narccistic culture.
034580404X|3.0|It's not written well, but it's entertaining. If you like Twilight, you will like this. It's essentially the same thing but replace vampire with flogging and you have a book. Something to do when you have no plans and TV sucks.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I loved the video of the recording session, it made me feel like I was there during the recording. Great video! The CD was awesome! I really love this CD! Everyone shoud get this!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a much used app on our tablet. It has a thesaurus as well as the dictionary. It is easy to use.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I liked this book but liked hopeless a lot more.  I gave this book three stars because there were things I liked & disliked (the liked outweighed the disliked hence the three stars).  Liked the male lead in this book and the love & strength of family in thus novel. Golden Hoover is a genius for making great boyfriends in her novels.  If we could only clone them into real ones.....My dislike of the novel was the protagonist who at times was so selfish and whiny.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I first saw the DVD of this performance on public television and knew I had to have the recording. It is excellent.
B001A4LYN2|3.0|Slow and dark but very well acted.  Lewis delivers but not for women and children in my opinion.  Guys movie!
B0042JSMV4|5.0|This book has helped me understand the construction of a decent border without having to put days (weeks!) of thought into creating it. She explains how to put on a base row and then it's very simple how to add the remaining rows to add pop and drama to the rest of your blanket or whatever it is you want to dress up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to add a little yarn zing with color and texture in their lives.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follet's characterization shines in this epic sequel to Fall of Giants. One day over Christmas holidays I actually stayed on the couch in my pajamas for six hours plowing through it. Every time I put it down to do something the story drew me back in. I enjoyed it much more than Fall of Giants.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|This record is tremendous plus a bit nostalgic for me personally. This album came out when I was in high school and still stands up this many years later.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Michael Shannon is great and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good. The dialog and story is pretty cheesy, but overall a pretty fun movie with cool visuals and great chase scenes. Not a lot too remember but the chases and speed of it.
0984725113|2.0|Given the other reviews, I was expecting an interesting examination of what is a very real challenge to our economic system.  This short read offers a cursory review of the challenges wrought by rapid tech innovation and bare bones solutions.  For a superior treatment of the same subject, read Martin Ford's Lights in the Tunnel, which I'd give a 4-star or 4.5-star.
B0000024YL|5.0|I grew up listening to this music was very happy to find it on CD.<br />I would recommend this and the seller to a friend.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Would recommend this product. Nice, lightweight, but thickly padded. Great for clumsy people like myself. Nice quality for the price
B000GB775E|5.0|I was very pleased with the movie. Enjoyed it would watch it again.<br />I would recommend this movie and the seller to a friend.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I really like this app, however since i installed it, my phone keeps freezing. my weboot security warned against installing it but i had it once before with only this same issue.<br /> That being said i love the pictures in the add on puzzle packs.<br />It would be great if they could fix the problem, beside then i would give it 5 stars
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyable conclusion that had held me in suspense from the start.  I enjoyed a chapter or two each day until finished.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I highly enjoyed this film. Well acted, well written story with lots of heart. While it is heartbreakingly sad, it also manages to be uplifting and life affirming at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. I highly recomend this game to anyone who likes temple run; because Subway Surfers is 10 times better.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This movie is LEGENDARY!!!  One of my all time favorites, I just wish they would come out with a sequel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever is a lot of fun and some time challenging but it is awesome
1451629192|5.0|This book gives a great deal of insight to the kidnapping and the 18 years of being held hostage of Jaycee Dugard. Also, it tells of her recovery since being found. This is a very interesting account of a real life drama.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Useful for  how much battery time  you have for certain apps and the graphs are also interesting to look at.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book I couldn't stop reading it. Although it ended predictably the twists and turns made it worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Some days you will feel bored then something hit you that mad people are talking about subway sufer and then you got the app and that game is amazing lol.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy was awesome.  Talk about keeping you intrigued.  My daughter is not a reader, but once she started this trilogy, she read all three in one week
B00867GJYK|5.0|This movie is one of the best disney pixar movie ever invented and the first pixar movie that won an academy award, it contains a whole fun for anyone of any age. This movie would stay in your heart for the rest of your life specially in a father and a son. Anyone who said that this movie doesn't worth of one time, that person doesn't know how to appreciate a really good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Swear this s*** is addictive. Uber good!!!  DOWNLOAD!!! I make sure i play this game everyday. All the updates and ñew ppl. Sooo fun. Better than temple run -___- dead ass. Keeps you busy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Initially, I was skeptical about the subject matter of the book, but decided to give it a try.  I can truthfully say that I had trouble in the first three chapters understanding the terminology, and the strangeness of the settings.  However, once I made it past chapter 3, I was spellbound.  I had trouble putting the book aside to do household chores, and it was often haunting to me at night when I would sleep.  All in a all, I'd say that it is probably one of the best books I have read in many years, and as far as the subject matter goes, I can now visualize our world and the US being in such a state of destruction.  I have since read books 2 & 3 of the series and loved them!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Thank God for hints because it was hard the first time through to figure out where to go. Many different locations to explore and a great storyline. It is a &quot;to be continued&quot; ....so if that sort of thing bothers you, this might not be your game. It really isn't much of a cliff hanger but more leaving it open for a sequel.  I did have trouble at the end of the game because it froze at the rock when I did it wrong. I reset the whole game and played it again.....darn...Lol. it was fun enough to play twice!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is an Awsome and interesting game. I recommend that every one should try it. It is so fun and enthusiastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter kept telling me to read this, so I finally did.  Once started, I couldn't put it down.  Great!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Where I want ... move between rooms, on kindle fire.. I love it.  I am not tied to a room and can have great sound and video quality anywhere I choose to watch it and when I choose
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my brother got it and he had to reload the whole thing but on my lindle it didn't even need to be reloaded.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are much better than the first temple run the weird monkey is even better and bigger than ever. The game has more obstacles including an mineshaft and zip line. minecraft people who like minecraft it is like the ather
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is way better than temple run..at least I think.  If your playing boring old temple run get sub surf
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Kahnemann shows us lots of potential failure points in our judgements. It's a great read, making you really think that people are not always as smart as they think. The professional research and reasons behind are truly something to appreciate.<br />A definitely worthwhile read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book I will classify as one of the best books I have read so far.He keeps you in suspense the entire reading. I finished it in less than 2 days. I had a problem with putting it down. I had to keep starting my Kindle so I could find out what was happening next. A five star book for sure.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I think the idea is great, the style (or the six different styles) are amazing as well. It's the plot that bothers me. I expected a strongr connection with the stories, somehow it failed to realize...
B004GHNIRK|5.0|a very interesting book, I found it interesting, a great story makes the film more interesting, I found it easy to read,
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love this production-the performers,music,set design as well as the lighting are first class.Ramin,Sierra and Hadley(Fraser),acting complements each other very well.And Andrew Lloyd Webbers music is wonderful and passionate.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys opera or live stage productions.Nancy Costello.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is very sweet. You never know what may happen next. It's not the usual sappy love novel that women eat up every word of. It's real and for the most part, believable. A very good read.
B0076DELIG|2.0|This is another great book by Connelly. Interesting story with plenty of twists and turns that keep the reader eager to turn the next page.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yum all al all al stuck advice about weird alwhiz whiz whiz whiz would weird whiz al all ask hpquip al all<br />I Great app. It

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app has amazing graphics, and is so much fun to play. It has all new characters and one BIG monkey! Get this app, it's great!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie was the biggest seller for a reason.  Joss Whedon did an excellent job as both writer and director, and Tom Hiddleston as the evil Loki steals the show.  Even if you've never heard of a Marvel comic, you will love this movie.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Ice Age is always good! Very entertaining. The characters are so cool! I will look forward to another sequel! Great
B0091W9L58|5.0|This is the ultimate Romantic musical of its era!<br />Wonderful!! music and story are delightful. recommended for all family members
B008M34INW|4.0|I like the thinking behind it. Meal's character was pretty smart. It wasn't a lot of bad stuff. I liked it.
B0026NBZEY|2.0|I downloaded this book to my Kindle via my local library, but couldn't finish it, 'cause I had no clue where the story was going.<br />I mean, what was the point?  I never figured it out.<br />Then, there was all this back n' forth with the diaries.<br />The whole process just took too long.<br />I'm probably too shallow to enjoy a book like this.<br />Oh well ... can't enjoy 'em all.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I read to be entertained, really, and this book did that. Enjoyable, well written, it was just a good book to read....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like a bit of drama, history and romance this has it all. I can't wait to get to season 3
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love the story line, the actors; the main house and houses; their clothing; the village.  Maggie Smith is a riot; love her!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my son loves this game, i think angry birds are okay,. really not for sure what the big to do is about them. but it is fun to play

B00A757EFW|3.0|this game is okay. loved the old pacman game. its a little hard to control the pacman. but its worth playing sometimes
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  Really gets the mind working.  I can sit for hours playing it.  Great for all ages.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|This game is well done; looks great; very fun; needs online player to player to get 5 stars. Great board game for those who love to try and outwit their opponents.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great story with characters that you fall in love with immediately.  Well written. Good acting.  Can't wait for more episodes.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Written with historical accuracy, Follett weaves the story of four families and seamlessly intertwines then. I highly recommend this book.
0757302661|4.0|This book was a great introduction to the concept of hypnosis for childbirth pain control.  It was my first exposure to the idea, and it sold me on it!  This book made me believe I too could do a natural unmedicated childbirth.  However, even though I listened to the CD and read the book, I felt I did not have enough tools to figure out how to make it happen.  I yearned for a program to follow or a training method that this book did not offer.  I eventually ordered and used the HypnoBabies Home study program.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|he loved it. right out of the box he began playing with is. the gold guy is his favorite character
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I was a fan of the original screen adaptation &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; with Sylvester Stallone at his scenery-chewing best.  If you didn't like Sly, you still had Diane Lane to look at and Rob Schneider's character for comic relief.  Even though the film had flaws (notably a flat, unexciting ending) it was fun if you didn't expect too much.<br /><br />This sequel (it's not a remake) manages to keep all the flaws of the original but throws away all the fun stuff.  There is no humor, no real interplay between the characters, and there are no breathtaking special effects vistas or action set-pieces. Virtually the entire movie takes place inside one large, generic, scummy-looking building which looks drearily ordinary.  Dredd (Karl Urban) never takes off his helmet during the entire movie.  Come on - even Robocop took off his helmet at some point.  The IMDB entry for this movie says the cost was $50 million - it sure doesn't show on the screen.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Much better on the computer, iPad, and iPhone. A decent attempt at a Kindle app, but it falls short of being good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful but painstakingly sad story.  I devoured it in almost one sitting. Now I want to read it again and absorb it.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I couldn't get past Adam Sandler as Count Dracula!  It is a cute story idea, but I've seen better children's movie.  I'm glad we rented it, but I don't think we will add it to our children's movie library.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This has all the key title tracks along with other key songs and some filler. The only thing missing is the Skyfall tracks but I didn't want to wait another year and then get the 26th anniversarry CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi this is fun to play subway surfers became you can run jump and roll thank you how ever made this.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so amazing. It has put so much more fun into my life. Most days I would be bored,but now I can read and comment and even create my own life changing pins. This app changes lives ,for real.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lots and lots of fun.  closest thing to owning a real horse.  This app works great on the kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best game. I think it is better than temple run but it still has to have some edges need to be tweaked up.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is adequate and serves it's intended purpose. It gives you a visual as to your battery status and it shows you how much battery life you have for each application.
B000RO9VJK|3.0|The book starts out good, you get an idea of what a business is, however he takes way too much time and detail to give you the information you need to move on. Also was not really happy with trying to get my own business running by myself. He assumes everyone wants a chain of business or many employees. I don't!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love how Stephen King gives you unexpected twists that really make you think.<br />You just never know what life will throw at you and how you react can affect the world around you.......
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. She is a very courageous woman. Don't agree with all her choices in life, but then I try not to judge. Her life, her decisions. But still a very good book.
B0093OGBL6|2.0|Many people loved Michael Jackson for the creative genius that he was. Not everyone should write a book. Especially someone that didnt actually know him.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has all the stuff I want to know about.  Lots of ideas and stuff I'm going to do &#34;someday.&#34;  AND a place to store all those ideas..
B009MO57H6|3.0|The DVD itself was fine, exactly as I had expected.  The false advertising involves the fact that the digital download IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN USA.  This fact CAN ONLY BE LEARNT when one reads the advertising label attached to the outside of the DVD packaging.<br />American film marketers sell to the international community (i.e. accept OUR MONEY) but treat ANYONE outside America as VERY second class citizens.  Extortionate prices for software and hardware is another example.<br />Given that I do not know anyone in America, NO, I would NOT RECOMMEND it to ANYONE!<br />On the contrary, I would highlight the false advertising and America's disdain for all customers living OUTSIDE the US (but NOT for their MONEY)!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very entertaining! Kept me busy while laid up. Well worth the money. I have spent more on these types of games that pale in comparison. Thank you for great games at affordable prices!
B003TOP7RK|5.0|WILL MISS HER! WISH EVERY ONE COULD EMBRACE THEIR UNIQUENESS AND BLOSSOM AS WELL AS SHE DID. INSPIRATIONAL SHOW. STUMBLED ON IT AND WAS SURPRISED HOW WELL IT WAS WRITTEN.

B008220BLG|5.0|So you probably knew or read that the new film Warm Bodies is based on a young adult novel, and you thought to yourself, \\"no way, not another Twilight.\\" Surprisingly, this film, while fine for young adults, appeals to the mature romantic in all of us as well.<br /><br />Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: First Class) stars as \\"R\\", the zombie with a non-beating heart of gold who does the unthinkable: he makes you swoon over a dead guy. R can't remember his name or anything about his past life, and he spends his days aimlessly roaming around an abandoned airport with his best friend, \\"M\\" (Rob Corddry - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart). He explains his sorry state of affairs via voice-overs, and we are immediately drawn in by his casual sense of humor about his sad circumstances. R is someone you would want for a friend.<br /><br />R has nothing to live for (pardon the phrase), that is until he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer - Take Me Home Tonight). Julie's father, Grigio, (John Malkovich - Con Air) is a powerful figurehead who leads the remaining, uninfected humans in preserving their mortality. They live in an army base while Grigio and other soldiers carry out nightly patrols, keeping an eye out for any corpses they may have missed.<br /><br />R, M and a group of their zombie buddies cross paths with Julie, her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco - 21 Jump Street) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton - Crazy, Stupid, Love) when they are on the hunt for their next meal. R tells us that he does not enjoy hurting people, and he would appreciate if you look away while he executes Perry for sustenance.<br /><br />While not overly graphic, we do get a few shots of R eating Perry's brains (including that which he saves in his pocket for later), but this is less gross and more symbolic, as R explains that he can absorb people's feelings and memories from their brain matter, much in the same way that cannibals believed they could absorb someone's power from eating their flesh. We are moved as opposted to disgusted as R lives vicariously through flashbacks of Perry's life, and he explains that even though he feels remorse for the way in which he feeds this insatiable need, this act allows him to feel alive again, even if only temporarily.<br /><br />R sees Julie and immediately falls in love. He saves her from his hungry friends by putting some of Perry's now dead blood on her face to cover up her live smell. This allows her to walk past the corpses without drawing attention (paging The Walking Dead).<br /><br />R leads Julie back to his \\"home\\", an abandoned airplane where he stores the items he collects on his aimless travels. Most prominently featured are R's records, which punctuate his feelings with the likes of Guns 'n' Roses and John Waite. When Julie asks why R prefers records to iPods, R responds, \\"better...sound...\\"<br /><br />At first, Julie is afraid of R, but predictably she learns to trust him. She wants to go home, but R informs her it's not safe to leave right away, so she stays with R, passing time by teaching him some of human games and doing other cutesy things. The two grow closer, but how could they ever be a couple?<br /><br />R realizes that he is slowly being cured, and that it is Julie who is bringing him back to life. Though, when R and Julie's relationship starts giving the other zombies hope, what can at first be beautiful turns dangerous as they are not only escaping humans who don't believe in a cure, but they must also evade creatures known as \\"Boneys\\". Boneys live among the corpses, and they kill anything with a heartbeat without a second thought. This was never a problem for the corpses before because they never had a heartbeat, but now...<br /><br />Warm Bodies is a terrific date movie, and it is appropriate for young adults as well, as is evidenced by its PG-13 rating. It will leave you with a warm feeling and it might even make you cry. Warm Bodies has been cited by People magazine as \\"the best zombie movie in nearly a decade.\\" While not all guys may agree, girls may see this as the zombie film they've been waiting for.e.\\" While not all guys may agree, girls may see this as the zombie film they've been waiting for.

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie really shows how gritty Americans can be when we have to.  Packed full of great actors and a movie that's based on real events that actually stayed extremely close to the facts.  If I was Gorro from mortal combat I would give it four thumbs up.  If your still wondering if you should watch it the body count sits at 18 U.S. soldiers vs 1500 dead Somalia militia.  Don't you want to know how?
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Its rare to find a loveable character in a book that really only has one. The style of writing allows us to get into the head (and presumably the authors head) of Mark Watney - an astronaut inadvertently left on Mars. The author has good technical knowledge and seems able to back up all the ghastly situations he finds himself in. Great yarn and a big adventure - Loved it...

0765356139|3.0|Let me preface by saying the first book, The Final Empire, was phenomenal and an excellent piece of fantasy writing. I literally could not put it down.<br /><br />Not so with this one, where it actually sat on my desk for a few days between each reading session.<br /><br />The first major flaw was the dialogue. Sanderson seems to have a habit of making his characters sound like modern-day teenagers, not characters in a fantasy world that is modeled after what I assumed to be France or England in the late middle ages. Maybe most people don't care about this, but it jumped out at me and bothered me. It was present in the first book, but the story and characters were so awesome that it overshadowed the bad dialogue. The irritating nicknames they called one another like they were the best of friends (\\"Saze,\\" \\"El,\\" \\"Dox,\\" \\"Kel,\\") were nauseating.<br /><br />Next was a subplot that literally looked like it was taken from a WB/CW series. You have the love triangle between the \\"good boy,\\" the \\"bad boy,\\" and the female protagonist who felt that she was growing apart from the \\"good boy\\" that she fell in love with. Maybe Sanderson was trying to appeal to a large female demographic by adding some \\"chick flick\\" elements to his book, but I would think having a fantasy novel with a strong female character as the lead should suffice without the cliched romantic nonsense.<br /><br />The next major flaw was the complete lack of events in the first 75% of the book. I am not joking. NOTHING seems to happen at all. We get a lot of chapters of Elend trying to be king and Vin kicking some ass (which was not all bad...). Throughout it all, we have the boring internalizations from Vin and Elend about their relationship.<br /><br />On a side note, I find sex between a 16 year-old and a 22 year old disgusting. If Elend was 30 and Vin was 24, then fine, but not 16 and 22....<br /><br />The final major flaw was pointless characters that were thrown in as filler. Tyndwyl and Zane were a waste oftime. How can I make this statement? If you eliminate them from the story, it changes nothing. Without spoiling anything, Vin's revelation near the end of the book could have been done a different way.<br /><br />I have said a lot of negative things so far, but the book got 3 stars because the final two acts were difficult to put down, and the final battle and the ending was truly awesome.<br /><br />Onto the Hero of Ages....

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so glad I heard about this series.  I watched the first 2 seasons on Prime Instant and was hooked after 2 shows.  I enjoy the third season now on Sunday night!  The best TV in a long time.  It is fascinating to see how people lived in the early 1900's.  We could learn a lot about traditions and respect.

B008CRC506|5.0|I had heard a lot about Smash and saw the first show of the season on TV. There were so many characters that I was turned off immediately because when there are so many characters it is difficult to keep up and remember who is who.  For some reason I didn't let that stop me when the DVD of the First Season came out--WOWEEEE!!! I can see now why this show got all kinds of good press. I just finished watching the whole season from this morning until tonight.  The story reminds me of the movies long ago about broadway and theatre and rising stars. Katherine McFee has a huge part (remember her in Idol) and she is fantastic. Angelica Houston and Debra Messing are also featured prominently and Jack Davenport (if you never saw COUPLES-GET IT NOW!) and a few other people you will recognize from other shows. The story is a story in  a story regarding developing a musical about Marilyn Monroe (if you don't know who she is you must live under a rock!) and the back biting and all that goes with the making of any broadway show-everyone wants to be the star and it's a fight to the finish. The music is absolutely glorious and I intend to buy the sound track asap. This like some of my other reviews is a joy to watch and again with no special effects and music and dancing throughout the show. The main characters - well they are all main characters and they play them perfectly and once I got into it I had no problem figuring out who was who. I can't wait until Tuesday when the second season starts;... believe me--if you don't see this show you will be missing what I almost missed and this is another series I intend to watch over and over and over! They may be some folks who don't know about Marilyn Monroe and I would suggest they seek out some of her movies so they can see why even more than 50 years have gone by and  she is still a box office hit!!  In one word: FANTABULOUS!!!!

038572179X|4.0|This novel is often lauded for the literary devices, such as the `unreliable commentator', employed by Ian McEwan, a mainstay of contemporary British literature. On reading, I found these to be more twists of plot, a plot which is credible though not at all complex. McEwan unwraps events slowly with layers of detail and suspense. His characterisations are powerful, challenging the reader to relate to the characters in unexpected ways - I was particularly taken with a character's experience of `astral travelling', flying above the ground in moments before waking. This meticulous story development makes a reasonably straightforward novel powerfully engaging.<br /><br />McEwan is a gifted writer with a lucid and compelling style. To my experience, he has never written a bad novel. Atonement is exemplary as a rich examination of the human condition.

0765325950|5.0|Those who don't like battles aren't going to like this book, since there are battle scenes virtually from start to finish.  Demandred does show up, and does cause a heap of damage to the Light forces.  There are a few inconsistencies from earlier books, and the ending leaves much unresolved.  However, I think that Brandon Sanderson has done a good job in concluding the series.  Jordan had allowed it to become overly bloated, and it had to be wrapped up.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|This Movie is Biblical!<br /><br />When evil descends upon you, how do you hold onto your humanity, your sanity?<br /><br />I recognized the title of this movie, but was stunned by the character and humanity of The Victim among victims.<br /><br />I truly appreciated Morgan Freeman’s masterful narrative.  I liked the way the victim while having some of the most cruel and spirit crushing things visited upon him, did not become a mean, nasty person; rather he held on to his beliefs, life experiences and used what he had learned to produce good in and for people.  This victim knew the good in himself, and saw the good in others regardless of the bad things they were guilty of committing.  Witness the friendship between Tim Robbins, The Victim (Defresne} and Morgan Freeman (Red).  Oh my God.  Jesus!<br /><br />mmc

B00AGKHEUI|5.0|It's about time a special-special-special (3 CD) edition of this seminal album was released, even though it's technically been 36, not 35, years since its original release date. What more can be said that hasn't already about one of the greatest records to come out of the modern rock era? Not being familiar with the 2004 original remaster, Disc 1 of this set (the remastered original album with the addition of Silver Springs) sounds so much better than the CD I've owned for years & years there's absolutely no comparison. Disc 2, selections from the 1977-78 Rumours World Tour, is surprisingly clear, and it's fun to hear the group perform in their heyday. Rounding out this superb collection is a disc full of early takes, demos, and instrumentals, which is fascinating for any completist or Mac fan who hasn't heard these before. Can't recommend this set highly enough...and the price certainly can't be beaten!
B005LAII3U|4.0|The remake is of a world that is hugely adavanced and totally keeps you wanting more. The machines and gadgets are a glimpse of our future..  And that is where the world is heading. One day robots will do all the work and everyone will be unemployed.<br /><br />The theme of this movie is of two people which is the mind blower: the good you, and the bad you. Which one was he?  Keeps you always guessing. Not knowing which one are you would blow my mind for sure.<br /><br />The arnold version was b-rated and cheesy. The newer version got rid of silly martians and updates this to a totally believable future except I kept wondering where they mined so much steel for a world like that.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi junkie this is your movie.

B00065MDRW|5.0|What became known as \\"progressive rock\\" (and sometimes as \\"art rock\\") peaked in the 1970s and sadly faded in mainstream popularity as punk swept up the charts with its vastly, and often intentionally, less sophisticated instrumentation. Punk's relative simplicity directly responded to progressive rock's sometimes complex integration of classical, jazz and rock motifs that often incorporated \\"heavy\\" lyrical and musical themes and concepts that could run an entire album. Progressive rock also required highly skilled musicians, but almost anyone with a garage could crank out a punk song, which was somewhat the point and likely also contributed to punk's rising popularity in the late 1970s. Pop, rock and many mainstream music forms still live in the shadow of the punk \\"revolution\\" that edged out Progressive Rock and its more demanding musicianship. Maybe that's why listening to a progressive rock classic such as King Crimson's stunning 1969 debut \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" today almost seems like listening to music from another world, especially for those born after progressive rock's reign. How would music like this get made and distributed today? Maybe over the internet by committed hobbyists, but definitely not on any major label. By today's standards, this is crazy stuff.<br /><br />King Crimson kicked off their recording career, and boosted progressive rock's popularity, with the wild classic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man.\\" Following some indistinct murmurings, a massive musical attack rips the helpless sound waves with layers of guitars and horns riding an unforgettable buzzy melody. The lyrics sound ominously prophetic today, especially the line \\"nothing he's got he really needs.\\" \\"Schizoid\\" refers to a socially aloof person given to deep fantasy, a personality type not unknown to our now 21st century. Filtering the half-screamed vocals through tight band saw distortion only adds to their gritty intensity and creates, for its time, a sort of musical psychosis. Robert Fripp's always astounding guitar playing sounds more like classical grunge here than anything typically heard at the time. Its staccato blasts during the verses cut deep into the senses. The long instrumental portion of the song, another progressive rock trademark, showcases the band's exceptional musical skill and weaves in and out of complex timings and styles. Jazz, classical and rock mesh beautifully here. This highly cacophonous and frenetic number remains one of progressive rock's masterpieces. It hasn't faded. A snippet of the song even appears on Kanye West's 2010 \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\\"<br /><br />Following the insane closing of \\"Schizoid,\\" almost immediately the mood shifts to mellow relaxation. \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is as beautiful as \\"Schizoid\\" is disturbing. The transition might even jar some people on first listen. The rest of the album remains largely on this wavelength. Astonishing mellotron washes over the even more gorgeous \\"Epitaph\\" with its melancholy refrain \\"but I fear tomorrow I'll be crying.\\" It paints a somewhat pessimistic, though poignant, portrait with lines such as \\"Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams\\" and \\"the fate of mankind I see is in the hands of fools.\\" \\"Moonchild\\" incorporates fantasy scenarios, yet another progressive rock trademark, and Fripp's ethereal wavering guitar hypnotically completes the scene. The musical interlude here feels like a soft dream sequence. Then mellotron, a sound that would define early King Crimson and eventually progressive rock in general, once again erupts at the beginning and throughout the title track. Following the song's final triumphant crescendo, a small section of what sounds like music for drunken jesters morphs into a discordant variation on the song's chorus and the album closes on a tone cluster. By this time one's musical senses have had a vigorous workout.<br /><br />King Crimson would of course carry on in countless mutations. The lineupfor \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" lasted for only this single album. Robert Fripp would provide the sole continuity throughout King Crimson's long and varied career. The band managed to outlast punk and even the progressive rock era that spawned it. Along the way they provided many curious cochleas doses of rich and unique musical landscapes. \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" remains one of King Crimson's most memorable albums as well as one of the highlights of progressive rock and the music of the late 1960s in general. The also unforgettable cover art sums up the experience nicely.for \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" lasted for only this single album.

I think it will help to make Darth less scary and intimidating for him as well. Again, just a funny and cute book.  Now we are waiting on the Princess Leia version for this Father's Day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great for any traveler or on the go person who doesn't have the time for a PC or game system to stay at.
B005LAII08|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie for my daughter and its finally come!  My daughter loves the Disney princesses but I am so tired of all the story lines revolving around them trying to find and marry princes. This has all of the great Pixar animation and dialogue but with a strong heroine who just wants to go on her own path. A couple of scenes may be scary for younger  kids, but for the most part it is the perfect princess story. I hope to see more of these in the future.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I got this to convert optical audio out to RCA audio so I could use my Boston Acoustic sound bar with my Panasonic P55GT50 tv.  I hooked this up and didn't have to change any audio settings on the TV.  It worked immediately.<br /><br />I also like that it is powered via USB.  So I plugged it into the USB port on my TV to power it rather than having to plug it into an electrical outlet.  I would recommend this to anyone needing to convert optical to RCA audio.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our family of 4 who all have different tastes in board games all like this game--a lot. I'm not a fan of risk or monopoly but love this game and would describe it as a blend of the best parts of both.
B00005KAQP|5.0|Always a pleasure!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game crashes so much....please fix or uninstalling on my kindle fire hd.  Other than that, it's very fun and addicting.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Got this for my Mom as a gift, she watches this over-and-over-and-over again! I think it was her favorite gift of all, but I can't be truely sure, because I cannot get her away from the TV long enough to find out!!!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This series is wonderful! It combines elements of all of my favorite genres ( fantasy, romance, sci-fi, etc...) and even has me appreciating mystery, which I normally don't. It has excellent character and plot development and is frequently laugh out loud funny. Intelligent without being stuffy, it has turned me into a steam punk devotee overnight. I will read EVERYTHING by this author from here on out because she never fails to impress and entertain.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I got this cd for someone as a gift and was enjoyed very much. I did get to hear it myself and I thought it was pretty good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it I  think the limited time people are. Way to expensive I think they should do it 70000 instead of 95000

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. It sometimes gives you a headache if you play it too long because it has so HD graphics. but in the end I recomend this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time I upgraded. it and. instead of regular subway suffers its now Rio subway. surffers
068981528X|5.0|My son found this book in the library quite a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  I used to tell the story of the Three Little Pigs to my grandson every time he went down for a nap or to sleep when I baby sat him.  He is now in Kindergarten and had this story read to him at school and thought it was wonderful!  I bought it for him for Christmas and it is his favorite story.  Fun, easy to read, enjoyable.
B004HD61KE|3.0|The book moved along at a nice pace. You have to suspend reality in quite a few places.  Its okay
0393327345|4.0|He was a normal guy, you know, good but boring job, IKEA furniture, nothing exciting happening in his life at all.  But he couldn't sleep so he started attending support group meetings, for diseases he didn't have like brain parasites and testicular cancer to help with his insomnia.  And it helped, for a while.<br /><br />But then he met Tyler Durden, who introduced him to Fight Club, and he didn't need those support groups anymore to sleep.  Fight Club is an underground club where the rules are simple:<br /><br />You don't talk about fight club<br />You don't talk about fight club<br />Two men per fight<br />One fight at a time<br />No shoes, no shirt in the fight<br />Fights go on as long as they have to<br />If this if your first night at fight club, you have to fight<br /><br />Soon Fight Club leads to chaos, madness, and mayhem.<br /><br />\\"After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Nothing can piss you off. Your word is law, and if other people break that law or question you, even that doesn't piss you off.\\"<br /><br />But hey, I know what you are going to say right now.  \\"I saw the movie.  I don't need to read the book.\\"  So don't.  But you're totally going to miss out on an amazing Chuck Palahniuk book.  Fight Club was made into an awesome movie, but I have to say, the book is just as good if not better.<br /><br />And you know what else?  I'm telling you to read Fight Club.  And my word is law, and if you choose to break that law or question me, even that doesn't piss me off.<br /><br />(Did you see what I did there?)<br /><br />Even in writing this post, I've risked everything by breaking the first rules of Fight Club.  So you better read this book.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game but some of the ppl r outrageous mounts of coins and the 5x coin thing doesn't work at all but other than that it's great and very fun:)
1451629192|4.0|You probably remember hearing the story of Jaycee Dugard, the girl who was stolenon the way to school by a disgusting sexual and emotional abuser and his wife, Phillip and Nancy Garrido.<br /><br />A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard is the story in her words, as she remembers it.  She tells her story of abduction all the way to her current life.  Throughout the story, she has intermixed some reflections of how she feels at this time about what happened in the past, or other information that she had learned.<br /><br />This is not an easy story to read because it's heartbreaking.  Jaycee was held captive in tents and backyard housing for 18 years, and in that time gave birth to two children.<br /><br />But Jaycee and her children were rescued (this is not a spoiler, this was national news), and it's her honest, true story.  She's also an inspiration.  If Jaycee can get through this horrific time in her life, can't we also do the same?  She's so strong and motivated to do the best for others and her family.  She even started the JAYC Foundation, which focuses on reuniting families that have been separated as well as with therapy and workshops for children.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading it, even though it was tough.  It's a real-life version of Room by Emma Donoghue, and all the more moving because of that.<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B000IXUOP0|5.0|No show has ever quite affected me the way NCIS does, and it's because of the camaraderie of the cast and the guest roles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfed is a great game. Exciting and keeps you on the edge. I recommend to other game lovers. Although ive had somecforce close issues lately its still and awesome game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best game ever if I could I would play it all day long!!! I just love how it looks and the whole concept of it

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|A great read on how the ubiquity of information has changed the balance of power in the sales equation and how today's salespeople must adapt to thrive.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|I read the books and love the Twilight series. Each movie gets better. I'm still TEAM JACOB. Bella is still insufferable.

B00015YVD6|5.0|I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing.  They are all good movies and received in great condition.  They make a good additions to my collection.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a great game. It is totally appropriate for children. It is not completely addictive, so you are not glued to your device. I love it because I can play it all the time, and I have my very own horse. It teaches responsibility. To me, my horse is a great game.
B000Q4RJWW|5.0|I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing.  They are all good movies and received in great condition.  They make a good additions to my collection.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to read the Bible.  On every device and easy to manipulate. Been able town read through the Bible three years in a row with this handy tool.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is probably the best mini-series I've ever watched. And, I began watching as a result of the urging of two male friends of mine. Even though their wives had probably been the ones to cause them to watch it initially, they both are now huge fans of the show, as I am. Time was well-spent catching up the first two seasons via Amazon Mp3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am enjoying the Downton Abbey immensely and would recommend watching it on Amazon.com  The picture is clear and, of course, you can watch it any time you'd like.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an intelligently designed and satisfying time waster. It offers a wide range of levels, from the childishly simple to the fiendishly complicated.  The object is to fill the square with colored paths joining pairs of matching circles. The graphics are lovely, and it is very easy to draw the paths on my eepad. There is a speed mode for those who need the stress in their lives, but I prefer the more relaxing puzzle mode. My only complaint, and it is a tiny one, is that it is a little too easy to accidentally obliterate one path while drawing another if my finger strays a bit.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is like a urban version of temple run. I like the spraypaint jetpack the most and my character is a robot named tagbot that runs through a subway that is awesome.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a charming and addictive puzzle game. It is designed so that you can learn how it works as you play it, beginning with very obvious solutions but progressively becoming more challenging. If you don't care whether you finish in the minimum number of moves, it will not be too frustrating. But the last few levels are quite difficult. The graphic design is very aesthetically satisfying, as the lovely blobs slide along the pathways, stopping when they hit barriers. If you make a fatal error (like having your blob go into an infinite loop), you can just restart. Highly recommended time-waster!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a novel of a sister and brother separated at birth. Jamie, number 86 survives until adopted by a kind couple. He has many happy years as their adopted son but upon their death sinks into a depression so severe he contemplates suicide. Though a heart warming series of events he discovers a new meaning to his life.  This is a wonderful story. 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is better than temple run and has better quality. This is awesome nd has a sweet taste bye now
B000002L68|4.0|I bought this to replace the old scratched vinyl - it was good to hear it again after so long!
B00003CXCD|4.0|This was such fun to watch, a gay time with a sense of foreboding knowing it can't last.  The characters were well played, very real in their situations.  They deserved a high rating for  being real.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It was seriously funny! I had no issues viewing it and I loved how quickly I was able to watch it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Never even downloaded. I had to call customer service to have it force stop. Had WiFi going too. Nothing. Glad to finally have it gone from my screen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun and entertaining for pretty much all ages boy or girl. Great game to keep them busy!! I enjoy it as well. ;)
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|it works great, i love this products , everything I expected it to be and a lot more, get one and you will also be happy
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It started off as yet another good read of the genre &#34;literary fiction&#34; that I mostly enjoy.  At some point, hints to a darker plot are slipped in.  Then the book becomes a page-turner.  Ultimately this book will cause the reader to question his own all but unanswerable moral and emotional beliefs.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|it works great, i love this products , everything I expected it to be and a lot more, get one and you will also be happy
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is quite richly featured, especially for a freebie! It has a nice variety of sounds which can be mixed and layered for your own custom experience for meditation or sleep. I especially like that you can control the volume of each layer of sound individually for wonderful effects. The theta wave inducing signal feature is an additional bonus. I like this enough that I may eventually upgrade to get the 96 sound expansion. Highly recommended for insomniacs! I suffer from very extreme insomnia and this has helped me sleep better than playing relaxing music. The fact that it's level and doesn't change rhythm or pitch too much means that it doesn't disturb my sleep at any point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game... I enjoy the updates that seem to come up monthly. I play it every day and have gotten several friends addicted too!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it!  i was a bit disappointed in how abrupt the ending came but overall, i really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great i love this app so fun i do not understand the low ratings  great time killer i love games with &quot;objectives&quot;
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|The movie was just as promised. It was hilarious! and I love the digital copy (actually I think this one had UltraViolet [but same thing]) option that comes along with the movie!
B004LWZW8S|5.0|This movie is great in so many ways. I thought this was going to be a rip off of 300 which it kinda was but this was 10x better than 300. It was over the top, really gory, and acted out very well. If your into old school mythology and gore than check this sweet action movie out. Also don't get it on DVD it looks great on Blu-ray.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson is great at any movie he does. This movie was one of those that made you think a little and those are always good.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If your a fan of Wes Anderson then I suggest that you go out and buy this movie right now. Now I do like some of his movies like, Darjeeling Limited, Mr. Fox and The Life Aquatic. This by far is one of his better films. Very original movie with great acting and dialogue throughout the whole movie. I highly recommend this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Challenging and fun game for true solataire fans!  More challenging than free cell game.  Nice for passing away spare time!
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|The film was too choppy and made you feel like you were on a small boat. Almost like Rocky over done.
B00A6SZRJ0|4.0|If you like big epic music, then Two Steps From Hell make it and Skyworld is another of their albums which showcases their big epic movie trailer style.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is my favorite game but it says that the game is not responding alot.That is the reason why I gave it 4stars but otherwise it's awesome. I totally recomend you getting this game because it rad.It is very addictingly fun.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have read all his stuff. I would highly recommend this series to those who've never read it. Excelant read.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I finished it in one night. And now I want more. Keeps your . Mind going at every turn.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|But fun anyway if you want to kill some time. I never buy extra coins, just use what I accrue from the night before. It does keep you hangiing onn the edge of your seat waiting for that one coin to drop when it's been dangling on the edge. I like when the giant coin drops and shakes a bunch of coins down.
B004HD61KE|4.0|It was very interesting with the history, and mystery. It got hard to keep up with at times especially in the beginning. Once you got a good hold on the characters and their roles it was a lot better.
B005HSL626|5.0|Before I got my Kindle I was not much of a game player but this is one of my favorites. Who doesn't like to hack up fruit? It's fast, fun, and addicting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. There are some good plot twists to keep it interesting.  I can't wait to read more work from the &#34;Wool universe&#34;.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I never was very good at hockey but it's fun anyway, very fast paced. I like how you can change the looks of the board . Just wish I could win now and then.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A well told story of becoming alone yet not being alone. I was moved by something, some message or maybe just to voice of the story, to a deeper understanding of what being set adrift means. It's hard to say more without giving something away but I will say that this story will stay with me for some time to come
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Although I've just stuck with the free version I like the variety. Very realistic looking, easy to work and have had no problems.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Great CD, I love her voice!!  She has such a clear musical voice and I love the songs that she sings!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've never had any problems with this app. It does all I need it to, scrolls fast, no glitches or stalls. Works perfectly to me.
0393334988|5.0|What an awesome story of forgiveness and reconciliation!!  It's not easy to let go of bitterness and hatred, but when you do you win!!
1616550414|5.0|I'm actually an employee of Amazon Fulfillment, a co-worker of mine discussed having heard of the Japanese version of this book, and that it contained the OFFICIAL TIMELINE, something that every Zelda Fan has speculated on for awhile, so I went online to Amazon in the faint hope I might find a screencap of it in the \\"inside this book\\" feature. Instead I found the English Copy about to be released... and for less than 20$! Whoa! I said, just in time to have received a good sum of change from my birthday I had zero hesitation on throwing down that money, best 20$ I ever spent on a book, period!<br /><br />The book actually presents itself as a sort of history book for the game, while there's no specifics on dates and years, there is a very clear chronicle of the CURRENT timeline of the game series. I say current because even on the pages which show it, there is a mention that it is subject to change, and it may not be official canon but is instead the most accurate according to Historians which aren't always known for accuracy. I'd warrant that the timeline won't alter much, but it's good to see an escape clause listed there so they don't feel confined by this auxillary text when it comes to making new Zelda games.<br /><br />There is a lot of mention of course of newer titles, especially Skyward Sword which dominates the entire front quarter of the book (Sigh! Now I really need a Wii!) I was pleased to see that virtually every single Zelda game is covered in this book with some detail. The games that are NOT featured in this are the CD-I Zelda games (not considered canon anyway), the BS Satellaview Zelda game, or Link's Crossbow Training. There is also no mention of the Legend of Zelda cartoon series that aired as part of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.<br /><br />What I was pleased to find was lots of art from the origional game manuals included with the older LOZ titles. The storybook intro cartoons from Zelda II's manual are all here.<br /><br />The quality of the book is not what you'd expect for 20$, it's very nicely done, it's quite weighty and each page is lovingly detailed in full detailed color at high gloss. It was amazing working at Amazon, the few days before release I saw a pallet of over 1,000 copies of this book disappear in less than a weekend. It's definitely a worthy addition to any Legend of Zelda collection, and for the lore-buffs, it's enough to make you cry. Don't hoard your rupees, it's dangerous to go alone, take this!
B00846REIS|4.0|Read these books as a recommendation from a friend. Very well written and hard to put down. Can't wait for the 3rd book out in May.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|It's just like experiencing the movie!  Visual images pop up as you listen to the dialogue clips and the songs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My grandson ask me to read Hunger Games after reading it for school. This has been my first chance to do so, love it. I can see why it was made into a movie. Being involved with costuming for several years made me want to recreate the those described so beautifully. The whole book was a love story to me. Not just  for show to win the games but her love for family. This has it all, love, hope, risks, suspense, death everything needed for a good book or movie. Maybe I'll watch it next or maybe I'll order the next book in the series.
B0036OS3JM|5.0|As expected, nice and confortable. For extreme cold is not the best, but are ok anyway for daily use. Recommended.
B00471TLZS|3.0|The movie was a good movie, but you couldnt see it very well it would stop and have to buffering, really bad,  It was very upseting.  We watched Poltergiest, at netflix and that worked great.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|May start slow, but stick with it......well worth the read. Very well written and now hope that the movie does this book justice.
143911000X|5.0|My son and friends review this endlessly.  They also quote from it.  Shipped on time and was reasonably priced.  Legendary.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I was left wondering who wrote large sections of this book.  It does not seem up to Clancy's usual standards.  For example, if one is to use a term like \\"basis point\\", please use it correctly.  The plot is predictable, except for some of the rather low probability constructs used.  A good editor should have caught the grammar, spelling, and content errors.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|classics just keep getting better, my grandson is re-reading it and finding new meanings he missed as a small child
0385341008|5.0|A lovely book .... wish there were more like it.<br /><br />A glimpse into a little known history but mostly into the way people affect others.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This is a good version of the game, because it is easy to play,  Also the was good price.  Quite addicting
1451620829|5.0|Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, you wanted the dirt on KISS, you got the dirt on KISS....right here in their original Catman Peter Criss' autobiography, Makeup to Breakup.<br /><br />Here, for a total of three-hundred and sixty-five pages, Peter \\"Catman\\" Criss takes the KISS Army on the wild ride that he himself has been living for sixty-seven and a half years (starting on December 20, 1945 in the New York City borough of Brooklyn). You've heard all about the Catman being a tough Italian Roman Catholic off the streets of Brooklyn. Now, you get to learn all of the stories behind how the Catman became the Catman, not only in KISS, but also in his life outside of KISS (remember that Peter chose the Catman as his KISS character because he considered himself as someone with nine lives, which he said enabled him to survive his upbringing on the streets of Brooklyn)! How the Catman became both volatile and soft is revealed here, and how he survived his hellish years in and out of KISS is completely documented as well. It is clear that the Catman is more than just a character in a rock and roll band, and it is in Makeup to Breakup where he reveals himself to the world, warts and all.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we finally see a whole entire perspective on KISS offered from top to bottom (where as \\"Space\\" Ace Frehley glossed over a lot of details about certain events of the band and their career in his 2011 memoir No Regrets). Who ***really*** was behind the band's creative process in the very beginning, why we do not hear Peter and Ace (but instead Tommy Thayer and Kevin Valentine) on Psycho Circus (another important issue that Ace glossed over in No Regrets), plus more....it's all here. Whereas Ace sugarcoated the evil done unto him and did not cover it in full detail, Peter offers a completely full glimpse of it ***all***. And he doesn't just talk about himself (compared to Gene)--he gives the dirt on everyone around him, inside and outside of KISS. Makeup to Breakup is far, far away from being a sugarcoated or one-dimensional autobiography. It is good to see that Peter was able to step up to the plate and unleash the whole entire truth (and nothing but the truth). His honesty makes Makeup to Breakup more detailed and complete, and makes up for what No Regrets and Gene's two autobiographies (2001's Kiss and Make-Up and 2003's Sex, Money, KISS) did not give us.<br /><br />Now, I know what you are thinking...how can we ***completely*** trust Peter when there are two sides to every story? Well, let me remind you of this: it is not just Peter and Ace who have told us that Gene and Paul are major narcissists. From Ace, we learned about some of many lies that have been told about him, like, say for example, stepping back from The Elder and ***never*** walking back to it again. Now, with Peter, we learn of more lies that have been told by Gene and Paul (think that those guys ***really*** brought in Vini Poncia to produce Dynasty because they wanted to prove to Peter that they thought well of his solo record? Guess again!). So, in the long run it is safe to trust Peter more. Ace and many others have proven that themselves. Besides, even when you can't take someone's word about another person over the word of that \\"other person\\" themselves, we've all learned enough about Gene and Paul to realize that Peter is telling the truth.<br /><br />Aside from the \\"two sides to every story\\" issue, you have some important things that Peter did not cover at all:<br /><br />1)His relationship with Eric Carr(sadly, the late Mr. Carr--RIP--who reached out to Peter after he replaced him--is mentioned in only sentence of Makeup to Breakup).<br />2)How a song of Vinnie Vincent's (Tears) managed to end up on Peter's Let Me Rock You solo album two years after Peter had departed from KISS.<br />3)What songs on Ace's Trouble Walkin' solo album we do and do not hear Peter performing on (with the confusion about whether or not it is Peter or Richie Scarlett singing2 Young 2 Die still existing to this very day, with different conclusions still floating around in the KISS Army from the singing voices of Peter and Richie being very similar to each other).<br /><br />Regardless, I can't hold any of this against Peter: while it still would have been nice to learn about things like these, Peter did spend his time chasing after the stories we've never heard before, making good use of the time (there were some stories in No Regrets that I thought could have been shelved in favor of more stories from the reunion, Psycho Circus, and farewell tours) regardless. And, to sum it all up, I will quote the very last sentence of the cover jacket for Makeup to Breakup:<br /><br />\\"Rock `n' has been chronicled many times, but never quite like this.\\"<br /><br />Nothing could be closer to the truth about Makeup to Breakup. So, please sit back, relax, and enjoy the rare journey back through time and rock `n' roll in Makeup to Breakup.2 Young 2 Die still existing to this very day, with different conclusions still floating around in the KISS Army from the singing voices of Peter and Richie being very similar to each other).<br /><br />Regardless, I can't hold any of this against Peter: while it still would have been nice to learn about things like these, Peter did spend his time chasing after the stories we've never heard before, making good use of the time (there were some stories in No Regrets that I thought could have been shelved in favor of more stories from the reunion, Psycho Circus, and farewell tours) regardless.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and was thrilled when I got the email from Amazon saying that I had access to the rest of the series!  How great is that!  Only problem is I can't talk to others about it since they are watching them as they are shown.  This was the BEST season for me and I cried the most!
0316069434|4.0|Let me start out by saying how pleased I am that Michael Connelly is still writing novels featuring LAPD detective Harry Bosch.  I was starting to worry the Connelly had retired Bosch (understandable, in a way, as Bosch is a Vietnam vet and a bit long in the tooth for police rough stuff) in favor of Lincoln lawyer Mickey Halloran (a poor substitute, in my view, but that may reflect my preference for cops over lawyers).  Bosch is my favorite detective character among active police series novels today.  He's smart, intuitive and highly principled (he says of murder victims, &#34;they all matter, or no one does&#34;) without the unrealistic quirks that authors feel they have to build into their detectives to make them interesting.  For example, John Sandford's Lucas Davenport is a Porsche-driving millionaire, PD James' Adam Dalgleish is published poet, and Elizabeth George's Inspector Lindsay is a member of the House of Lords.  Bosch is a realistic figure.  But The Black Box left me just a bit unsatisfied.  The detective story is interesting enough, based on Bosch's cold-case investigation of the unsolved murder of a Danish photo-journalist in LA's 1992 race riots.  But Connelly's recent Bosch novels (not only The Black Box, but also The Drop) seem increasingly consumed by Harry's conflcts with his immediate superiors in the LAPD.  Sure, the uncompromising rebel is a staple of detective fiction (I miss Philip Marlowe and Travis McGee), and Bosch always had problems with the politicians in uniform at the top of the LAPD.  But now it seems he can't even achieve a modus vivendi with the detectives who head his Open Unsolved squad.  One wonders how Bosch can get anything done when his bosses are trying to get him fired.  More detective work, and less politics, would improve future books in this series.  And I hope there will be future Harry Bosch books.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|I order a lot of movies 'blind' not knowing what to expect.  Sometimes I'm pleased and sometimes I'm disappoined.  With Pandorum I was definitely pleased!  This is a really cool movie.  The special effects and CGI is very good high-quality.  The \\"creatures\\" are done very well.  They look realistic and scary without being corny or over-the-top.  The acting is good.  The storyline is good with some interesting twists along the way.  Overall it's just a really good sci-fi movie!  I've been living in a war-zone for 5 years, so I'm out of the loop with what's going on in the real world.  When I saw this movie, I didn't know if it was a big-budget blockebuster or a cheaper B-movie.  But after watching it, it's definitely a high-quality movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book, read it to connect with my two older granddaughters. They have seen the movie and are in the midst of reading the whole series and nana has to keep up.  I'm in hopes as I read the next one it doesn't disappoint.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|An Inconvenient Truth was an extra credit opportunity for my college non-lab science course. The politics and name calling and insults were unnecessary and actually diminished any respect I did have for Mr. Gore just as a human being. The science in the documentary  was great.

075669812X|5.0|The Encyclopedia is perfect for the Ninjago fan. My six year old grandon loves to look at it, especially since he can take it where Ninijago Legos and other toys cannot go. He is just learning to read so the pictures are very helpful. He loved the fact that the &#34;green&#34; Ninjago warrior came with his. I guess he is very hard to find.
0812982622|3.0|This is the BEST BOOK I've read in a long time!!! I could not put it down and as a result stayed up till all hours finishing it!!<br /><br />I was astounded to read that the author is NOT Korean!!! It is so authentic that I just assumed it was written by a Korean!! As it turns out Adam Johnson was born and raised in the United States! WOW!! How did he know all the nuances, customs, and even dialects of the characters he writes about??? Amazing!!<br /><br />Yes, at times the plot was hard to follow, but well worth the concentration required!  I was fascinated by the brutal life in North Korea during Kim Jong II's dictatorship.  The propaganda, the random arrests and imprisonments, the paranoia, the starvation, the torture, etc. were startling conditions to me especially when remembering this was during 1994-2011.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was when Pac Jun Do got to come for a brief visit to Texas.  The vast contrast between life in America and life in North Korea could not have been more dramatic!!<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|With the chapters running back and forth between husband in present day and wife explaining their past, the book starts out rather slow and I didn't think I would like it.  There are clues dropped, but sometimes undetectable.  Once Amy's chapters return to the present, the book takes a very interesting twist and her megalomaniac self comes out.  Even another twist emerges with an old lover--big clue as to how &#34;sick&#34; Amy really is.  Don't want to give away the ending but just to say good doesn't always win out in real life.
B0015DROBO|2.0|A very gritty mystery.  Not really a surprise for the ending, and the lead character was well...not believable.  For me did not live up to the praise it was given.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish it were a little more interactive with grooming, like brushing it. I still love it though! ~Yu gi oh 5ds ftw~
0765325950|5.0|There is one regret that I have about this book and that is Robert Jordan was not able to complete it.  Other than that Brandon did an excellent job of filling in the gaps that were left.  Yes I am sad the series is done, but at the same time I feel that it was ended very well and didn't leave me feeling disappointed, that was the most important thing.  Much was left to the readers imagination such as the rest of the lives of the characters, and other characters were given their just rewards.

159315724X|4.0|The Compound Effect is a great, easy read which encourages action. If you have read any Success literature or self help material in the past then there is nothing new here. However, in The Compound Effect Darren Hardy brings together all of those little habits that are scattered throughout other titles within the genre. None of the information is really &#34;new&#34; and if you have read or listened to Darren Hardy you have even heard him say many of these things before. But in a world where we are pulled in so many directions at one time this timely little book on habit and discipline is right on the money.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|If you grew up playing games than you will really appreciate this movie. There's tons of throwbacks to older games and it's amazing how many iconic gaming characters Disney was able to use in the movie. Wreck-It-Ralph is one of the more unique animated movies I've seen thus far and it is definitely worth a purchase. You'll be able to watch it multiple times and still enjoy it which is really the only reason to ever buy a movie.<br /><br />Younger people may not get some of the references in this movie since a lot of it is from pretty old games and the same goes for people that don't play games at all. You won't appreciate Wreck-It-Ralph nearly as much if you don't know who most of the characters are. Seeing all the iconic gaming characters from the dawn of gaming is really what makes this movie so great. While watching the movie I began thinking about when I was younger and played most of those games. I've never seen a movie that made me remember so much from my childhood that I had forgotten over the years. It's a trip to say the least!<br /><br />Wreck-It-Ralph is one of the best films of the year in my opinion and I think everyone should see it at least once!
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Sometimes it works, sometimes it will load but you can not play it. A waste of money. My child is always frustrated because it will not play!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I almost play it everyday but the thing that makes me mad about it is that I never got the jackpot and them bouncy shoes are so stupid so I think you should take them off....
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Is very helpful when you are away from the home computer to be able to acess the Kindle for facebook.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|This was the pilot for a show I never saw in it's first run.  I can see why this charactor is an icon for resourcefulness and is frequently mentioned on Mythbusters and NCIS.<br /><br />It is a very witty and lighthearted show.<br /><br />I wish it was available to borrow or rent.  I don't think I will watch it very many times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty awesome but it takes a lot of coins to get boards and characters but it's worth it for cool stuff and also you can get special people that are limited addition that cost 95,000 coins but you can save up for them cause they give you 16 days.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I have not  finished it yet, but so far I would describe it's separate sections as fascinating short stories, masterfully written. The time periods and characters differ widely, but the author's control of his characters and his ability to draw the reader in to each new scenario does not. I suspect the  plot lines  will converge in the end, but it is so good, I don't want to rush it! Susan Frost
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really liked this game. Not your typical hidden object game, there is a lot of variety to keep you interested. The minigames were fun but it was nice to have the option to skip if you did not want to play them. I hope there are more new games like this one.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Oh George, you almost lost me with this one.<br /><br />This has got to be the worst book in the series. It's a tedious read. The descriptions are belabored and unnecessary. Too many new characters are introduced, and there's not enough of the old ones to sustain interest. The prose is noticeably weaker. Martin is no longer even trying in some parts, using the same words, expressions, allegories, and examples to describe very different situations with different characters. And I noticed some proofing mistakes as well, as in mispelled words or missing words. So evidently the editor didn't want to read this mess.<br /><br />It was also during this book that I realized how much Martin had bit off when he attempted this story. And he's not really handling it well by this point. I think I know what he's trying to do. There is a feeling that he's setting up something very elaborate for the later books, but in the process of the set up, he lost sight of the fun and intrigue that captured me in the first place.<br /><br />It feels like the series is unraveling, it's becoming very piece mealed, and there's a sense that even Martin doesn't know how he's going to pull this off.<br /><br />I'm worried.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can never get tired of this game. I play almost very day. It's so much fun!<br />Everyone should have this game.
0345535421|4.0|And the rabbit hole goes deeper. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that this series is becoming more complicated and intriguing by the book. At times it does feel convoluted, or at least, confusing. I had to re-read some sections several times, and there were many more characters introduced, which is kinda overwhelming. However, there is a rich fandom and lots of websites dedicated to answering questions and discussing plot points. One shouldn't have to rely on that though. That said though, I can't stop reading. This particular book had some major plot twists and revelations that have pulled me deeper into the series. I have to see what happens next, how all of these characters paths cross, and where their roads will lead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive a great time waster n its always the best when u try to outrun your friends. also each day you play it u get more coins and its rly rly fun alot of people are playing this game. Its somewhat like temple run but its better! :)
0439023521|5.0|Set in a post-apocalyptic future North America, this book is about one girl's fight to stay alive. 'The Hunger Games' is a yearly tournament in which the districts that make up the civilization known as Panem, have to send in representatives to compete to the death until one survives. Two children, a girl and a boy, from each district are sent to this tournament, where they are given minimal training and then thrown into a controlled arena surrounded by cameras for the whole country to see. It's reality tv on steroids. But unlike our reality tv, they aren't competing for personal gain. These kids have no choice, and the prize is a unusually generous amount of food for that District. You see, the districts are all under control by the Capitol, which rations (and withholds) food and resources to maintain control. The Hunger Games is a reminder to the districts that they are in power and must honor that power. The children who are chosen to compete are aptly called Tributes and it's supposed to be a honor to fight in the games, but as you can imagine it's terrifying and something to be mourned if you get chosen.<br /><br />This book focuses on one Tribute in particular, Katniss, from district 12 and her journey through the tournament. Of course this isn't just about Katniss. We get to know the other district 12 Tribute, Peeta, and their mentor who survived a previous Hunger Game, as well as a host of other characters who either help prepare Katniss for the competition or who are competing with her. I won't say much more than that because what's so awesome about this book is that you really don't see what's coming. I had no idea what to expect going into it, half way through it I had no idea how it was going to end, and even at the end, I had no idea what could possibly be next, but I really really want to know. So thank goodness I started reading this after the trilogy was completed because there are two more books.<br /><br />I really love the protagonist, Katniss, the most. She's a strong, smart, and tough girl, but she's emotionally retarded. We see this most in her budding relationship with her fellow Tribute, Peeta. That relationship in particular was a surprise for me as a reader because I thought this was just going to be about fighting, but there's romance, or at least a strong potential for romance. The writing style is very simplistic, but deceptively so. There are layers here and emotional complexity with subtle social commentary or rather observations that ring true to our own society and human nature in general. The narrative never comes across as preachy though. It's written in first person, and you really do feel like you're listening to Katniss' thoughts. There's also a lot of ambiguity that will leave you with mixed emotions - my favorite type of story. For those who may be put off by the premise and prospect of children killing children, I won't lie, it's brutal at times, but there are also moments of inspiring human kindness and sentimentality that will give you hope.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is  a very fun game, download the game, play the game, like the game.  You will not be sorry.  I putty the fool who does not download.
B0082S3FA4|1.0|I can't. And I really tried. I made it through the first quarter of this book before stopping and asking myself why I was putting myself through this torture? Was it because it's a much beloved and highly regarded classic? Was is because not finishing a book about a brilliant British detective would some how reflect on my own intellect and refinement? I don't know, maybe it's all of these things, but I no longer care.<br /><br />Holmes is not an interesting character. He reads like a fantasy caricature. And I like fantasy, but I need to be able to relate and like the characters. Holmes' supernatural ability to guess and observe any and every thing about everything got old really quickly. He's unreal and I can't relate or learn to like him. With each new situation, his absurd propensity for solving all problems grew more annoying. And the scenarios he's put in as well as the side characters he interacts with (aside from Watson, who I actually liked) were even more unbelievable.<br /><br />So basically, overall, I really disliked what I read, and frankly, I don't care how uncultured or dim that makes me look. I'm smart enough to know when a book is simply not my cup of tea to stop reading it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  game is spectacular, amazing. The graphics are mind blowing its make he or she finger active<br />To me as a fan it's the best game out right now<br />Personal as fan some of the game is boring
055357342X|5.0|This is the best in the series so far. It's also the longest.<br /><br />There were so many *shocking*, and I do mean, terribly shocking twists in this book. I wasn't prepared for the level of character development, particular for some of the \\"bad\\" guys from previous books. No one is really bad here, well, perhaps two or three, but everyone else is grey. Some of the chapter were very poignant, and Martin builds suspense like a true master. I'm still reeling from the epilogue, and I can't wait to see how the author is going to continue it.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Sometimes I just want a mindless game to pass the time with, and though this game can have a timer and the pressure therein, you can set it to endless with no timer and just play around at getting your highest score swipe.<br />I also like that you can change the skill level to suit your skill and/or mood.<br />All in all, a fun little game.
0439023491|4.0|A worthy follow-up to the first book in the series, 'Catching Fire' starts off where \\"The Hunger Games' left off. I can't really say much more than that because it'll ruin the surprise, or perhaps it isn't much of a surprise. I had an inkling where Collins' was going, but I wasn't completely sure.<br /><br />I think that the second part of any series suffers from the novelty and high expectations set by the first. So I did experience that with this book. It feels like we've been here before, and not just because it's the same setting, and characters, but because there is a plot device used can be mistaken for a rehash. But it's really not. There are new characters, and new challenges, and unexpected reveals. Once again Collins manages to fully engage the reader by putting us in Katniss' shoes, while revealing a much bigger, bolder (and more dangerous plot).<br /><br />My only real complaint about this book is that sometimes the survival games felt too far-fetched, or rather, unlikely, even in this futuristic sci-fi world. A lot is left up to chance and super-human ability to beat the odds, which are pretty slim in the first place. I was pulled out of the book a few times due to my own cynicism about how the characters (and author) would pull some of this off.<br /><br />But she did. Ultimately, this story works, and gives you just enough to want to read the final book. Really by the end of it, you have no choice.
0345803485|1.0|In the copy of the book I received, page 454 is followed by a repeat of pages 39-54, then picks up again at page 471. So I'm missing pages 455-470. I went to my account to return it as defective, but found out I'm 2 days past the return window, so I guess I'm stuck with it. Now, if I was enthralled with the story, I would be upset at missing out on a chunk of the book, but honestly I just don't care. If it was a good book, I would have finished it within a couple of days, I would have discovered the missing pages and been able to return it. But it took forever to get through. The story is dumb, unrealistic and basically a glorified romance novel. The sex scenes are intense, so if you want to read it for that, I would recommending highlighting those passages so you can go back to them and skipping the rest of the story. I'm sure that's the only reason this book has done as well as it has. None of the characters are likeable, especially the main characters. I'm sure there are better, well-written books with likeable characters that are also sexy, so skip this one. Oh, and the ending is just a ploy to get you to buy the next book. No thanks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved loved loved this book. I think this one was the best in the series. I love the first book because it introduced us to this new world, and we get to know Katniss and her family, Gale, Peeta, and her design team. And I liked Catching Fire because we really get a better sense of the type of evil Katniss faces and there's an entire new set of characters and complexities she has to deal with both within the arena and outside of it.<br /><br />But this book, Mockingjay takes the cake! I don't even know how to articulate how much this book affected me.<br /><br />*Warning- Spoiler Heavy Review*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />First, I felt like Collins' writing in this book was much more visceral and imaginative. Not only does she put you in Katniss' shoes, but you actually are in her head in a way that makes you feel like you're one with the character. I had a problem trusting Katniss' judgment in the first two books, but in this book, I was there with her, empathizing with everything she did and said. Even when I didn't like her reactions, I understood them and they seemed completely reasonable to me. Towards the end, when Collins' is trying to really convey Katniss' feelings about what she's seen and felt, she uses really powerful images. Entire paragraphs read like poetry, but somehow they never feel purple or pretentious, they just take you to a deeper level of understanding what Katniss is going through. I thought the last three chapters were pretty brilliant.<br /><br />And I really loved the politics and turn of events involving Coin. The way the story played out rung so realistic to me. I also really LOVED Katniss' surprise act at the end. I was pumping my fist when she turned her arrow. Really, the entire conclusion unfolded in a very satisfying way for me. I haven't read any reviews for this book yet, but I know there's some dissatisfaction among fans. I'm very interested in reading what people don't like about this book. The only thing Iwasn't particularly happy about was the lack of closure with Gale. I was sad and disappointed that they just stopped being friends and had no further contact, but at the same time, it also felt realistic considering his role in her sister's death.<br /><br />This isn't really a review but a list of things I noticed while reading this book:<br /><br />1. Like in the first two books, some of the violence, especially the pods that caused people's insides to explode and the mutts that clawed at each other to get at Katniss, seemed a bit extreme, and took me out the book a little. But for the most part, the action was really gripping and made me jump and flinch in places.<br /><br />2. I cried harder over Finnick's death than I did over Dumbledore! LOL. I don't know where that came from, but somehow Finnick really wormed his way into my heart, and it hurt so bad when I knew he wasn't gonna to make it. I think besides Katniss and Haymitch, he may be my favorite character.<br /><br />3. One thing felt forced to me: the conversation between Gale and Peeta towards the end where they're talking about who she would choose. It just didn't seem likely they'd actually voice those sort of things, but it wasn't so terribly forced that it took me completely out of the story.<br /><br />4. I figured out that the rebels had bombed the children before Katniss was told. I'm not sure why I suspected that, but it seemed illogical for the capitol to bomb it's own kids. Did anyone else figure this out as well?<br /><br />5. Despite that though, I was very surprised about Coin's ruthlessness. And I'm still a little baffled about Katniss and Haymitch supporting the proposal to have Capitol children participate in a Hunger Games. Was that just a ploy to placate Coin or did they really support the idea? I hope not, but I can't tell.<br /><br />6. I loved the ending, with Katniss confirming that she loves Peeta and that it's real, and the epilogue was so awesome. I'm glad she was able to have children, and the last line is brilliant.

0553801473|4.0|Much better, George. Much, much better! 'A Dance with Dragons' is a redemption of sorts from Martin's last book 'A Feast for Crows\\". It starts off a little slow, but then gets a lot more exciting as it progresses. Martin still tells a lot more than he shows and when he shows sometimes he shows too much, but at least here he practices some restraint. The editing is tighter, and the prose is much stronger. Best of all, there's a lot more action, and it involves my favorite characters. I was surprised by a few things, but overall there were no shocking twists. I am concerned about one character in particular. I can't see how the story can go on without this particular character, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see. The strength of this series is that you have no idea if the characters you love will make it and I really appreciate that Martin isn't playing favorites with any character, even the popular ones.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good read. Not the best in the series, but definitely not the worst. I have renewed hope for this story now, and I really wish he would hurry up and write the next one!<br />flag
B000KKPN5C|4.0|work properly, perfect fit to the camera and easy to carry. Arrived before predicted and in perfect conditions. Great value acquisition.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|This soundtrack is incredible. Every song is unique and tells a story of it's own. When compiled together, it creates a rich tapestry of music both past and present. The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is the dialogue from the movie that's thrown in before and after each track. I loved this movie, but I don't want to listen to bits and pieces of dialogue while I'm trying to relax to music. I find it terribly jarring, and disturbing, especially since a lot of the dialogue taken from the movie is focused on using the 'n-word'. I thought the use of the 'n-word' in the movie was appropriate and effective, however, on a soundtrack, it's just distracting and takes away from the listening experience. But overall, it's a great music compilation.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I've \\"dealt\\" with my curly hair for 40+ years.

B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I was reading an interview with Pete Townshend and he said Ozzy's bio was his favorite of the bunch. I can see why.<br />Unlike a lot of these books that come out slowly, Ozzy comes out firing and wild and stays that way. I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game. It's entertaining way better then temple run, if I must say. I like how they change the are where your playing at. I've had the game for maybe about a month and a half and its Ben changed three times. It's been to NYC and now Rio.great game.
B00B2QA646|2.0|I really hate to say this but, I really do not like Kierra Knightly as a period actress. She is very beautiful and show up well on screen, but there is something missing in her period films and I keep trying to watch her period films and constantly being let down. This movie cinematography was fabulous,the rest of the cast were great, location was great, and the costumes were superb. This was suppose to be a great film and the build up to the film was great. To me and this is my opinion I think that Miss Knightly was missed cast for this film...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Subway Surfers is amazing. It is really fun. The world tour makes it even more exiting. I love unlocking all the characters and getting the mystery boxes! Subway Surfers is the best game ever!!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First impression upon finishing Wool? HOLY CRAP READ THIS NOW!<br /><br />Second impression upon finishing Wool: But seriously, you should read this.<br /><br />I didn't know a thing about this starting out. I just saw that it had good reviews and I was in the mood for something scifi-ish so I went for it. Little did I know that this would turn out to be one of the best books I have read in a while. The story=fantastic. Characters=Fantastic. If I had to boil it down to an easy description I would say it has elements of Hunger Games mixed with a Video game series called Fallout. Mostly because there are underground vaults in Fallout and the dystopian aspect of Hunger Games. That is where the similarities end though. My point in all of this is that you should read this. You will not regret it and will likely be dying for more in this series. I know I am!
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved this app at first but then its gets boring. I loved it for the first few days but then temple run 2 came and its so much better but I give this 3 stars but I say get 2 instead
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app and In my oppion it is 10 times better than the first temple run,so if you enjoy the first temple run you'll love this one as well.I recommend it for all of you.GET IT!!!!!!
0141341416|4.0|I ordered this gift to meet the requests on a Christmas Angel tree for a needy child.  I was thrilled that the child requested books & this boxed set was priced so reasonably & is such a popular choice for young children.
B0080CL0HM|1.0|I love just about any adaptation of literary classics but this one failed on so many levels.  The costumes and lead actresses looked great, but there wasn't even much of old Paris to enjoy.  these seemed to be no point to this movie other than to show the teen vampire was a grown up...look at his bare butt sexing Christina Ricci!  Ugh.  I fail to understand the good reviews for this terrible movie.

B000005DQQ|5.0|This is a classic that any hip-hop head has to own on vinyl.  The sounds included in this record are astounding and catchy.  DJ Shadow created a true masterpiece in this album.  I love to spin it for any hip-hop newbies who define their music with the radio.  I love the aspect of diggin through crates to find those sounds (and I've come across a few of those sampled in this very album!)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Julian Fellowes is either really brilliant or a big turkey heart breaker.  This was a major hankie experience and, beyond that, it would be hard to say anything without revealing a story well worth seeing.  Not quite Dickens, not quite Jane Austen but definitely holding the hardship and personal interludes included in these authors' works.  Up and down and all around the viewer is led:  Downton Abbey is saved!  Downton Abbey is doomed.<br /><br />The characters and their relationships are so well wrought, down to the extant cultural limitations of behavior and manner, with great compassion and surly back biting and everything ordinary in between.  The class differences are blurred with Maggie Smith's character, seemingly so intolerant, the most accepting (and not) with love, care and common sense.  Her life experience, shared by no one else, can dictate nothing else.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a good escape to another oddly compelling planet of life experience.  While Mr. Fellowes may pull some heart strings, sometimes the good cry is worth the tears.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is an incredible upgrade from my old build that housed an AMD Athalon x2.  I love the transfer rates and video transcoding in a flash.  This processor is bound to be efficient and fast for years to come.  It was easy to install and came with a stock fan that I would recommend replacing if you plan to overclock the chip.  Other than that, its a great value for incredible speed and versatility.

B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This is not my first watch, but it is now my favorite. Seiko has several versions of the watch: with a black or blue dial, different colored bezels and metal or rubber bands. I got this one because the price was right, it had good reviews and I was not a fan of the blue dial. What I was looking for was a solar watch with a chronograph. The fact that it's a diving watch is a plus. These considerations basically left me 2 choices: Seiko or Citizen. Citizen's watches look great, but they are just more expensive than Seiko's. The closest Citizen solar chrono diver watch to this one was around $500, but it also featured depth measurement. However, the Seiko just looks nicer. I don't plan to dive to 600 feet anytime soon, but I will probably wear this watch everyday.<br />When I opened the package the watch was already ticking, but it had to be reset. I set it to the atomic clock on the second and it is still accurate to within a second a couple weeks later.<br /><br />I would suggest paying a little extra for two day shipping. Think of it this way, you will get to have your watch for another week, so your watch will be a week newer than if you paid for economy shipping. Who wants to wait for something like this anyway?<br /><br />The rotating bezel is awesome. I use it about five times a day - I prefer to use it rather than the chronograph to time my 30 minute lunch break at work. I can't believe I wore watches that didn't have it - such a good feature. The chronograph is great, since the actual second hand is a stopwatch rather than the second hand. I always preferred watches that had  a sub second hand, and this is the nicest sub second hand dial I have ever seen on a watch. It is big for a sub second hand and even has Luminova on it.<br />Last night I tested the luminosity of the watch. I set the bezel and set it under a lamp for twenty minutes, then I turned off all the lights and went to bed. It was glowing brightly until 5:30am, when I woke up and still noticed it.I went back to sleep and woke up again at 7:30 and it was no longer glowing. This means, that from 20 minutes of strong light, the luminosity lasted at least 8 hours.<br /><br />A few things that were not perfect:<br />Though the sub second hand is unparalleled, it is sometimes a tiny bit hard to read if the minute and hour hand happen to be hoving above it. In these cases it would be hand to be able to switch on the regular second hand, and to have the choice of switching it back and forth, which I don't think you can do, having glanced over the instruction manual pretty thoroughly.<br />Many people complain about the band. It's true, the band is stiff plastic-feeling rubber. I am sure it's not plastic, but it feels a tad like plastic. I have already ordered an obscenely expensive band for it though - the Super Engineer Type II Solid Metal link band. The band is 20mm, and I will update this review when I receive the band. A watch like this needs a better band, and if you aren't a fan of stainless steel, I would suggest heavy italian leather with six steel lugs. I am still looking for one that is the right size on Ebay. In any case, this watch would have been perfect if the band would have been on higher quality feel and the lugs were a more common 22mm rather than 20mm - which is a little small for a 40mm+ diameter watch.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely pleased. Amazon raised the price of the watch as soon as I purchased one, so it seems that they have a limited supply. That means buy one sooner rather than later.<br /><br />Some people complain about the 24 hour indicator. I can see where they are coming from. However, I actually like to see the hour indicated like that, since I am more likely to look at it rather than the hour hand sometimes. I don't know whether I would have wanted another feature in its place - there are already so many things to go on about this watch - but an alarm dial or compass would have been quite impressive. As it is I can't believethis watch remains in the 200$ range. In twenty years, when I am still wearing it, I am sure it will be worth more than 200$ as many vintage Seiko divers watches are selling for hundreds on Ebay, even ones that are 20 years old.<br /><br />You should hesitate to get this watch, but keep in mind that you will probably be disappointed with the band. It's an easy fix, and there are a fair number of options (Ballistic Nylon, Silicon) to satisfy you.

B0034G4OYA|4.0|Hotel Transylvania was a movie that my family and I got a big kick out of. Adam Sandler was the perfect voice and personality to make Count Dracula come to life. The supporting cast was wonderful and the overall movie was pretty funny. There is some bathroom humor in this movie, so if that offends you or if you don't want your kids watching it, you should be aware before you let them view it. It isn't anything vile, but there are some references to things that not all parents will find appropriate.<br /><br />What I did like about this movie, was that the story line was strong. The father was trying to protect his daughter and as the movie progresses, aside from the humor and the silliness, the movie actually has a point, which is saying something for an animated movie these days. I loved that all of the original horror characters like the invisible ,an, the hydra and and the werewolves were involved in the story.<br /><br />All in all, this movie made us laugh a lot. The kids enjoyed it from beginning to end and the animation was great. I'd recommend it.
0316044695|2.0|Okay, let me start off. I am a Democrat. I understand that Luttrell is a Republican, and many who read this are. And I'm fine with that. However, as the title of this review suggests, with all of his comments on liberals and the 'liberal media', it was difficult to get through. He starts off with an infrequent comment, but when the **** hits the fan in the book, he gets really colorful with his thoughts. I found myself frequently putting the book down, just because I felt like I was on WorldNetDaily or the like. My problem with the book is amplified by the fact that 1. Nowhere in the promotional materials does it indicate that this book has a Republican slant (yes, I realize it's not the main focus, but it deserves a mention), and 2. At one point, he clearly states that he is not a political person. And yet, he finds time to say how much the liberal media vilifies the military, how the rules of engagement are too leftist, etc. That really rubs salt in the wound. Besides that, there are a couple of other issues I have with this book. Namely, after he states the policy of not killing unarmed civilians, he goes on about how he wanted to kill some unarmed civilians his team had found. In addition, it does feel like he's somewhat full of himself and the SEALs, though I'm willing to let it slide given the fact that what he went through was crazy.<br />On to the positive stuff. The book did grab my attention, and when he wasn't going on about liberals, it was actually pretty interesting. I especially liked his description of SEALs training, as it really captured the intensity of it. So yeah, at least read that part.<br />In the end, the book did have a great story underneath it, it was just hard to get through those endless political comments to find it.
0740797719|5.0|This text was recommended by a local fine art painter, Tom Kegler, who is truly a gifted talent. He counseled me that Gurney's text would inspire and instruct me in the use of color and light better than anyone. It excelled my highest expectations. I am a very basic beginner, but Tom and Jim Gurney have changed my life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. if your a horse lover you will love this game. that is why I rate this game 5 stars.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Bought this as a gift, my sister loves it! It allows her to watch tv on it and read easily.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My five year old grandson loves this.  He says it's more fun than playing the video game version of Angry Birds, although it isn't MY cup of tea (but I am an old codger).
0143143492|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is my favorite author and this book is the most profound I've ever read (listened to).  I highly recommend it.
1442339527|3.0|This isnt a bad negotiation book but seems to be geared more towards professional negotiators, I was looking for more of an every day guide
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I don't pay for many apps, but love kakuro, so figured it would be worth a buck.  Money well spent.  Some reviews were complaining about not being able to do multiple penciled in numbers...  not sure if program was updated since those reviews, but multiple pencil marks work fine.  Also, on kindle fire, complete screen shows, I know one reviewer was having an issue with that, but not sure on what hardware...only con is that puzzles could be a little more difficult.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|...to India, that is.  You'll enjoy this story of unlikely British companions ending up in a small inn in India.  Award winners abound in this sweet story.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|This blu ray will not play in the 3 blu ray players I have in my house.... I'm very disappointed I have to go to the trouble of returning it.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|The whole series is great. Lots of action with a very good story line.  Amust if you like Vampiers and Lycons!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVE THIS ! It's like Sylvia Day met with E.L. James to make this amazing story! I am definitely looking forward to the third part!
B002ZG9800|4.0|Jim Carrey was good. It had me cyring until the twist at the end. This was a crazy, mixed up movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|LOVE THIS ! It's like Sylvia Day met with E.L. James to make this amazing story! I am definitely looking forward to the third part!
B004LWZW9C|5.0|This movie is so good  so many stars, each with their own scenario  Have watched it so many times and will wach it many times more.  Of course, when you are a Bon Jovi fan, this movie is or you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Enjoy the game. The daily challenge keeps me coming back. I am able to play without having to spend money. That aggravates me with some other games.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is fun and challenging. great for kids, teens, and adults! it is great for long car rides since I get bored easily.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I had this one on VCR tape and just wanted to update. This is one of my all time favorites.
0061537934|4.0|I didn't want to read this because it was written by a dog.  I just thought, no way would that concept hold my attention or interest for a whole book.<br /><br />How wrong was I?<br /><br />Many a tear was shed during the reading of this book.  It got to the point, I couldn't read it in public due to this weepy behaviour.  That's because the story is so real, well told and so emotive and believable - and all told by a dog (Enzo).  The highs and lows in this dog's life as he accompanies his loyal and loving owners own troubles and joys, drew me in from the start.<br /><br />Not a huge dog lover?  Nor am I.  But it doesn't matter.  You can't help but be drawn to the story and when it ends, you know you have read a great story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A book you cannot put down. The mind of this author to male this womwan do the unthinkable. It scraes me to think people are out there with this kind of mind. Hated the ending. She should of been put down
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I'm sorry to say that while you generously replaced our charger with this one, along with the Powerfast for Accelerated Charging, for free, it turned out that we needed to replace the Kindle Fire that was not charging.  (That was under warranty as well, thank goodness, and you replaced THAT free of charge, too).  Unfortunately, this USB and the Powerfast do not seem to work in my new Kindle Fire, either.  I don't know why.  Luckily, the new Kindle came with its own charger, as usual, and charges the Kindle just fine.
B00866JL96|4.0|Good to see Zac Efron in a grown up role for a change. Good story. The dog who played Zeus was excellent.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this tool all the time. It makes checking on items very easy. If you use E-Bay or want to start I would recommend this App.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! It seems so real! The horses look really neat and you can take part in training the horses and it's really fun
B008602KQI|5.0|I gave two of these as gifts at Christmas.  Both girls really wanted their own copy and were quiet excited about it.
B00466HM28|5.0|I really like this. It's amazing (hence the title). It's really easy to set it up as a midi controller, especially if you're using Ableton Live Intro.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a great game it is soo addictive I love playing it but my two favorite things are playing the game and herring the mystery boxes!!!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is an awesome series! It's wonderful to witness the love and caring between two brothers. They also show tremendous loyalty to their close friends ( ex. Cass-who makes a wonderful addition to the series).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. So addicting. I'm always playing. Even though I am not sure wat the 2x thing is. It needs better explaining
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In my opinion, The Racketeer wasn't Grisham's book ever.  BUT it certainly had a twist.  It was just good to read a Grisham book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This dvd is an above par film that I enjoyed completly. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk are all in this.  Loki comes to get what is being called the Tesaract. Loki enlists the aid of some nasty aliens to boot. Iron Man rocks and the Incredible Hulk steals the show. If you like comic books then you'll love this. Scarlet Johannson plays black widow and she does an excellent job of that too. I highly recommend this to kids and adults alike. If you enjoy fantasy and science fiction then you'll like this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mincraft oh Mincraft this game is really awesome if you don't know what Mincraft is I am going to cry this is an amazingnl game please buy! :)
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Spent an enjoyable hour plus watching this flick. Laughed and could relate on many levels. Who could go wrong with the cast! Great film to watch with the spouse, kind of makes you think a bit!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next season! This is one of my favorite series! Downton has many stories and the characters become very real to you
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 of the movies are spectacular. Nolan is a directing genius. From memento to these, i just love everything he puts out
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br />Wireless<br />Noise cancelling<br />Rechargeable battery<br /><br />Cons:<br />7.1 is a bit gimiky<br /><br />Notes:<br />I've had these headphones for over a month now and really like them.  They fit nicely over my ears and cancel out a good bit of background noise.  They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time.  A full recharge takes about 3 hours via USB cable but you can recharge them while you use them (which is really nice).  People I talk to on skype noticed an improvement in voice quality from my old $30 wired headset.  The 7.1 is a bit gimiky.  It sounds good, but doesn't sounds like 7.1.<br /><br />I've never heard any static or other noise with this headset even when roaming around my house.  The base is sitting on my computer desk (not elevated) and I was able to go ~40 feet away with three walls between the headset and the base and didn't notice any noise or loss of connection.<br /><br />I've used these for gaming (CS:GO, Diablo III, BF3) listening to music and to make phone calls and am very happy with their performance in all three categories.  It's nice to be able to pause music, skip a track or adjust the volume right on the headset (especially when wondering around the house).<br /><br />The fit is very comfortable but tight enough so the headset doesn't fall off when you tilt your head or look down (a problem I have with the wireless supra-aural headphones I use at work)<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />I really like this headset and don't see myself upgrading for years (or as long as they hold out).<br /><br />-Sammy_K
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Whatelse to say. If you loved friends then this a must have for you. It was the best of must see tv

B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was slow moving until the very end.and it was very wordy and redundant . At some point you knew the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game earns 5 stars because the game is fun and sometimes challenging  and when you get enough coins you could get a better person
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Season one was better. It was Scarier with a love story.  Season two had too many story lines going at the same time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS is like the best game I love it u should get it  GOOD trust me u will NOT be Srry
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you're looking for a Minecraft game,this is it. Its worth the money! Never be bored again! Get this app!

B009AVCAJ4|5.0|This blu ray release see a dramatic improvement in quality from the original release with the added benefit afforded by HD. Sound quality is clear with each channel balanced and pronounced.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am not a gun owner or a military person, but I read Kyle's book with great interest in the lives of people who defend our USA. The author gives new meaning to the term &#34; it's a long shot&#34;.  How sad and ironic  that Kyle has been murdered at a Texas shooting range.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great game. Temple Run 1/2 doesn't have anything on this game. It is more challenging than temple run and more fun. Instead of a fake monkey-bird thing, it has a cop and dog chasing after you like real life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome i tell u!!!  the theme/place changes about each month and you get diffrent people and challenges 2 win stuff... THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! and the best part: its free!!! get this app!!!!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say great great great!!! I truly like this series. It is done very well. Not disappointing. My sister told me I should give it a look.
1401201911|5.0|You like superman?  You like Russians?  The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Not fantastic but a descent hero fix. Gets better as the season progresses. I could do with less family drama and more arrows...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Its an easy read - well written - romantic, (at times steamy),  emotive, and slightly erotic - Definitely a cliff-hanger.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Fans of John Rebus will be satisfied his return in this book. Rebus is retired but working as a civilian on cold cases. A woman shows up seeking a daughter who disappeared 13 years ago, whom she believes to be connected to a series of disappearances along the isolated A9 highway. The scenes of Rebus' growing respect for a young DC whose remit is &#34;social media&#34; as he tracks the case is enjoyable. Rankin has included his more recent protagonist, Malcolm Fox of the Complaints (internal affairs), whom Rankin fans know is a sort of anti-Rebus, as compulsive about sticking to regulations as Rebus is about bending them. This was the least successful part of the novel: Fox seems stuck in, and has no involvement in solving the crime. Instead, the two of them seem to be used as good and bad angels in an uninvolving psychomachia for the police soul of Rebus' protegee Siobhan Clarke, a much less satisfying doubling than when Tony Hillerman decided to put Joe Leaphorn and Tony Chee together.<br /><br />I suspect Rankin has a follow-up planned. Rebus' relationship with the &#34;retired&#34; crimelord Cafferty seems poised for further development, and a new Edinburgh villain arises. Perhaps the Rebus/Fox relationship will become more complex in future books.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Talk about escapism!  I felt I was in another &#34;land,&#34; a fascinating demography -- albeit filled with hard-hearted, mean-spirited people.  A book of amazingly detailed imagination.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be nearly as good as it was. After all, I'm a dad with two kids of my own in high school. I should be too far removed from this film's target audience to be effected like I was. But, this movie is so well done that age proved to be no barrier to my absorption into the story. The actors are uniformly terrific. Emma Watson is radiant in her role, and even smaller parts played by big-name actors Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, and Joan Cusack are so well-played that everything in the story feels real. The affection the kids share, the pain, the angst, all come through without being preachy. It's simply a year-in-the-life, but it's very well done.<br /><br />I think this is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who's ever been in high school, but don't recommend it for children under the age of 12.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Truthfully wanted to buy local on this but couldn't find it anywhere for less then double the price.  Arrived on time and works great.  Would recommend...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it does crash on the save me and you loose your run that stinks but it is better then the first one
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I read mostly tepid reviews of this movie.  I found the movie to be much better than the reviews suggested.  Some elements of the story don't really make sense...  Why does organized crime have control over time travel for example?  Who knows.  If you can get past those elements, it's a solidly acted and thoroughly entertaining movie.<br /><br />I feel the ending makes up for any mediocrity in the middle.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game. Very addictive. Lots of power ups, add one and new cities make game more exciting. I highly reccomend it

B005KELQEU|5.0|Though rarely used the sleeve is perfect for taking the Kindle along on trips. The Product was exactly as expected and perfectly satisfactory.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is quite a long book but the pages just fly right on by. There's never a dull moment! I would definitely recommend it to someone else.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun but educational at the same time because you get to take care of your very own horse, and you find out the technique and ways of making sure your horse is properly taken care of and it is healthy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best, every month they update it and take the game to a new city.Now they are in Rio and last month they were in New York. Get the game it is amazing!!!!&
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I installed this app when I first got my Kindle Fire HD.  I usually use an alarm clock on my cell phone and thought this would be nice too.  Sadly, however, they push so hard to get you to purchase the full version every time you make a move that I found it rude and offensive.  The full app might be nice. I was almost tempted to try it because it wasn't that expensive, but there's nothing I hate more than when an app aggressively pressures you to buy a full version.  I pay for lots of apps but that's because I find I love the free version so much that I can't wait to see what the full version will offer.  But I'll never know with this one because it was too pushy and in my face so I removed it from my device AND the cloud and picked another alarm clock that I already like better anyway.  If you don't mind pushy ads and aggressive sales tactics, this is your app.  No thanks for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LIKE THIS GAME IT FEELS REAL AND ITS JUST SO FUN TO OWN AND TAKE CARE OF IT OWN HORSE
0714843377|5.0|This is a clear, concise book on how to make the most of your life.<br /><br />It's the book I'd like the entire population to not just read, but really absorb into their minds.  It's a real-world primer on working hard, taking intelligent risks, and building vision.<br /><br />If you're already an expert on that, skip it.  It recognizes that time is the last luxury, so it doesn't go into deep philosophies or life strategies.  I like having it around as a handy reminder, but I also like motivational quote magnets on my fridge.  That being said, there are a lot of books that will provide more detail and guidance on any one particular topic, but this one covers the foundations.
B00B7G23KQ|5.0|awesome movie scary made me jump a little but not to scary just don't listen with head phones on full volume
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game totally rocks, my stepdaughter who's almost 13, my son who's 2 and me who's 31 love it. I'm so good at it and look forward to playing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book pulled me into the lives of the people of Southport. I felt moved by Katies strength. Nicholas Spark you did it once again a real tear jerker.
1401940676|5.0|This is really an amazing book.  Her story is so inspiring, of true healing, and her experience of the deeper spiritual world underneath our apparent material world.  This is something everyone should read.  I give it to my friends.  Hearing her voice on the CD is especially down to earth and humanizing.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|This is a great series and the characters are well thought out.  I am on the 4th season and they are all great.
B005LAII9O|5.0|I enjoyed Savages very much because it was action-packed.  The women in this movie were strong characters, and Salma Hayek was stupendous as always.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Jack Jr.continues to carry on the family tradition of love of country. Clark, although older,still has what it takes to serve and protect the USA.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|We like action and adventure and this  movie did not disappoint.  The streaming was good with no stops or glitches.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Diana Krall has a sweet, sexy and pure voice that demands singing the Blues and old standards.  She's the best.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This was a very funny movie for a mature audience.  We enjoyed it so much that we are making this our annual Christmas movie!
B003G4IXBK|3.0|After receiving my &#34;new&#34; GG record I was immediately struck by the overall volume of the recording. The levels are much higher than the original, and I suspect there is some compression intruduced. With the louds softened, and the quiets raised the presentation is quite forward. The real problems however, are the sonic gremlins that plaque the record. There are spots of noise all over, almost like an electrostatic discharge. My original WWA press does not have these artifacts and is much better overall. Although a good original is no easy proposition, it is worth the efforts. This record has some good points, but I suspect that anyone looking at this title would prefer the qualities found on an original offering. Also my high quality record cleaner did not remove the glitches, they are not release compound related. The quality presented here is, in my opinion, better than the harsh CD versions around and not a total dissapointment, but not amazing like a good original with proper set-up.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This had a good mystery as well as the action and adventure.  If you have seen the commercials and assumed you knew how it was going to end...think again.
B0011TMOIK|5.0|This movie does the book justice and is a great fun experience. Love dobby the house elf and Tom riddle but the basilisk is the best
B005IU1OMA|5.0|The production quality on this is amazing. This is seriously the prettiest snowboard movie I have ever seen. They do awesome runs in some incredible places and it is put together incredibly well. My friends that don't even like snowboarding like this movie.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great time passing game. Its timed and the faster you clear the board of tiles the more stars you will recieve. You also get trophies on your accomplishments. I would recommend this game to anyone.
0425263916|3.0|3.5 stars.<br /><br />I don't really know what I think about this book right now.<br /><br />On the one hand I still don't really like either Eva or Gideon. Both are still entirely too possessive and jealous and have weird (for me anyway) reactions to things the other does. However I did mostly enjoy the book, despite having some issues with the storyline, some dropped questions that weren't answered (until the very very end), and the fact that the last 30 pages everything is neatly wrapped up.<br /><br />What I liked: The secondary characters. Cary, Mark, Shawna, Steven, etc. I really enjoy reading their interactions with Eva and Gideon. We finally get to see and meet one of Gideon's friends, who was protective and concerned for him. We only see him for about 10-20 pages but he's a great addition.<br /><br />What I was 'meh' about: Eva and Gideon. I find I occasionally don't mind their level of possessiveness and jealousy when it's only in one book or there is only one book, however when it's more than that one book I get fed up fairly quickly. Eva jumps to conclusions quickly and doesn't let Gideon get a word in edge wise sometimes just barrels through what he tries to say. However Gideon expects Eva to trust him completely when he gives her little or no reason too. Eva was correct, Gideon doesn't tell her anything so how can she blindly trust him?<br /><br />Lastly what I didn't care for: As I mentioned above there were some dropped questions/requests. Eva's mom came to see her and when they were coming back from lunch she froze, in front of the Crossfire building, she didn't say who or what she saw and scurried away quickly. So Eva asks Gideon to check the security cameras to see what her mom saw. After that there's not a word or thought about it till the last 40 pages. If my mom was that freaked over seeing something I'd been bugging Gideon every day to get that footage and I'd be wondering why he wasn't giving it to me. Another issue I had was Gideon being socold to Eva during the last 2/3 of the book. Now there's a part of me that understands and is fine with why Gideon separated from Eva during that time, because it's explained why he did it at the end but then there's the other part of me that is annoyed and angry at him for putting her through all that. Again, he's asking her to trust him yet hasn't really showed why she should trust him. She's told him so many things about herself and her past but he remains closed off, I don't blame her for not believing him for a while.<br /><br />Overall I will read the next one in the trilogy (I think it's going to be a trilogy anyway) but it's mostly to read the final book and get closure on the series instead of being really interested in what happens next.
B000EYK2GE|3.0|Music legends gather for a a once in a lifetime star studded Rockabilly jam with the great Carl Perkins. This soundtrack is from a cable special that originally aired in the 80's. I've deducted stars because the recording sounds like it was dubbed right off the film/video, so it's not too good. Perhaps this is the best that could be produced from the original source available. On the other hand, the packaging is excellent and there are plenty of liner notes.There is so much energy and good playing on this cd. Dave Edmunds, George Harrison, Ringo,and Eric Clapton pay due reverence to the rockabilly icon that helped pave the way for artists like Roy Orbison and Elvis. It's a shame that a better recording is not available, so this will have to do..
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|A great film that expands Holmes and Watson's relationship as well as introduces new characters, especially the imposing Professor Moriarty, whose intellect is equal to only Holmes'.  A good purchase for those who enjoyed the original.
B00A993UWM|5.0|There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said.  You either love Ke$ha or you don't.  Personally, when it comes to music that makes me want to get up and dance, there is none better.  There are some tracks in the middle that I could live without, but I can completely forgive those for the rest of the disc.  I love the beats, I love her voice, I love that her message is to just have a good time.  Don't let anyone shame you for that!  If their lives are so miserable they have to bring you down, screw them.<br /><br />Ke$ha is, hands down, my favorite current pop star.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|Enjoyable if not safe soundtrack by Thomas Newman for this newest Bond outing Skyfall.  Disappointingly does not include the Adele title song, so purchase that separately if you want to hear it.  Tracks are out of order, which is not exclusive to this CD but has always annoyed me, but does not detract much from the experience.  A good buy if you loved the music from the film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a wonderful game I love to play it it is great for anybody how wants a horse but cant have one :)
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore's return to Middle-earth brings back several familiar themes but mostly features new music for the adventure tale told in the film.  This special edition is fantastic in its packaging, with great liner notes and photos from the film.  The extra tracks and extended track are quite enjoyable and I cannot wait for the Complete Recordings edition's release which I can only hope is forthcoming.  A great buy.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|What I like:<br />The game has awesome graphics and can easily compare to Temple Run. The object of the game is to run as far as you can collecting coins, power-ups, dodging trains and barriers, all while fleeing away from the 'Inspector.'<br />What I don't like:<br />HOWEVER, when I reached about 30,000 coins the game reverted back to the original start-up. Therefore, I lost ALL of my progress bringing me back down to 5,000 coins and stripping me of my upgraded power-ups. (App deleted!)<br />Overall, this is a great time killer, but eventually the developer will rob you of all your progress.<br />(I am using a kindle fire)
B0058YPL66|5.0|I bought this set of DVDs so I could watch it without the constant interruption of TV commercials.  I am enjoying it very much.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read all if Ms. Morton's books and have lived them all.  This one was a little harder for me to get into but the mystery kept me reading.  Was not the ending I expected.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Since I like to know exactly how much battery life I am working with, this app has been particularly useful.  I recommend it for ease of use and convenience.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Very easy read, but you just don't want to put it down.  Lots of guessing, I wasn't right, don't know who is good or bad till the end.  Action, intrigue, some impromptu romance, Reacher gets the woman.  Great crazed bad guy. Another excellent Jack Reacher book.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I received the movie pretty quickly. The movie is funny and touching. I'm glad to hear that there'll be a second movie.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Wow this is such a good game .I can not stop playing this game.!!!=) I asked if my sister wanted to play it . She said yes and she played it for a while. :) =)
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|I borrowed this movie and loved it- had to own it! I loved Natalie Portman as a coy and sexy character. Career women have needs too.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Just an ok movie. I felt like I was watching glee. I did enjoy the song and dance but the plot was the same as every other teen movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not much for writing reviews. I have read 100's of romance, erotic, and paranormal books. This is without a doubt one of the BEST books I have ever read. This will be a book that I will go back to and re-read again. Gripping, sweet, first love....and heart stopping surprises. You will simply not be sorry that you picked this book up to read.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We have a 6month old, a 5year old, and a 10 year old. The older kids were home sick from school, so we bought this for them. The 5 year old watched it 5 times that day! Then, once the next day. The 10 yo watched it 3 of those times, and even the 6 mo embossed the graphics and music.  I think it was a hit!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|This is a fictionalized version of the story of LA gangster Mickey Cohen, excellently portrayed by Sean Penn who looks nothing like him. The action takes place in 1949/1950 and is not shot in black and white. Combat veteran Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is asked to form a squad of elite men to take down Mickey Cohen, but not as cops, but as a gangsters hitting his places one by one.<br /><br />John has a pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) who would rather leave town than have her husband take on the mobster. Saddled with the fact it won't happen, she helps her husband assemble a squad which includes Jerry (Ryan Gosling) a playboy cop who is seeing Mickey's girlfriend (Emma Stone). Emma Stone has played too many down to earth women to pull off a swanky mobster girl. She looked like a kid who was playing in her mommy's make-up box. Perhaps that was the genius of the film as she was to suppose to be a small town girl out of place.<br /><br />Jerry uses a pick up line from 1941 comedy \\"Hold That Ghost\\" when he talks about playing post office. Again, was this bad writing or would have someone used a line from a film? At times the characters acted like they came out of \\"Sin City,\\" stereotypes of themselves. Where do they get all these new Packards to shoot up?<br /><br />The film had some good lines such as Sean Penn: \\"All good things must one day be burnt to the ground for insurance money.\\" There is enough humor in the film to keep it from becoming dry.<br /><br />Now the bad news is that Mickey Cohen was actually brought down by the IRS and not the gangster squad. His girlfriend Liz (not Grace)did three years because she wouldn't testify against him. So as far as facts go, rate this well below an Oliver Stone film. I liked the film, but not because there was any truth to it.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Stripper with large pasties.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD and am very happy with the performance. It 'does exactly what it says on the tin'.I can see at a glance how much time I have for reading, gaming or surfing the web before I need to recharge.
B00992CF6W|1.0|i played this game everyday. i loved this game until like five minutes ago i went on all my worlds and every songle block i built gone!!!! this is the worst thing ever! i used tp love it more than any other app. NOW I HATE IT MORE THAN A YEARS WORTH OF WORK GONE!!!
0670023329|4.0|I purchased several copies as Christmas presents for family and friends.  So far the feedback I've received has been very positive.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent dramatic series. The product itself, however, was defective.  One of the Season 1 discs skips over a significant part of the recording.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|for those who have not watch the Vampire diaries . let me tell you do not start half way go to the forst season and watch right through you will love it and want more
B0097F3QYG|5.0|Excellent!  Definite understanding and pathway to make what is currently called Positive Affirmations work or not work. I can't believe it was written so long ago. Amazingly perceptive
B005LAIHYU|5.0|The movie is one of the best which gives the writers view of thre turning points of the civcl war. It has been said the rebels gave all as idf there was no tomorrow or they could nor die. a few twist made the movie interesting to watch wich unexpected turns along the way.  I look forward to the next movie writtenand produce well done love it

B004EPYZPS|5.0|Not what i expected. the movie unfolded give tit bits and you wanting for more. then the ending I would never have expected
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is much fun I wish there were more lanes to move into and that the world should Paris. If you get this your fingers are going to get a serious work out!

B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a great way to spend some free time. It has great features. It allows you to undo and show moves.
B004A8ZYZE|5.0|great in addition to HBR  book on presentation skills. Would highly recommend to those wishing to do more than just impart knowledge but to actually move behavior with presentation.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i love playing the game but i had had it for three days and it wouldnt let me play it. It would load then take me back to my home page. So i deleted it and got it again and when i turn off the tutreuil it gets stuck so i have to exit out and it wouldnt save.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|All of these books keep the reader spellbound from start to finish.  As an avid reader, &#34;best series&#34; honors are not conferred lightly.  Thanks Diana!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found myself captured by this book. It was romantic but had an edgy feel. As a women on her own I could identify with some of Miss Steele's traits.
0547884591|5.0|This guy really knows how to mix things up.  Lots of outstanding information to give old and new cooks different ideas of preparing food.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|It was so refreshing to watch.  Now I am caught up with the series and can discuss the sow with my friends.
1475143389|5.0|Mike has cut through the exercise noise and has delivered a books that is clear and practical. Working out in today's society is almost held as a lost art. Only a handful seem to posses the genes or guts it takes to get in shape. This is entirely far from the truth. Bigger Leaner Stromger brings everyone closer to their fitness goals. No need to pay tons of money for supplements or waste time with trainers. This book has it all. Just buy it. I'm serious. It's only like $12. If used properly, this book will pay for itself a thousand times over in terms of self esteem and healthy habits. Start fresh and make it count with this purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best good graphics you can feed your horse clean it play with it!!!!!!!!!!  i recomend it
B003L77GG0|5.0|Again, I love Smallvile and the discs are perfect. Can't say enough about the quality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|in my oppinion the graphics were better than the first temple run<br />but it would be better if you could have more charactors like the first
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very adventurous but a little disorienting as the Terrain will move for you. The jewel and upgrade system is new and everything has been revamped
1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves these books. I got it for him for Christmas, but gave it to him early he was saving his allowance for it. He really enjoyed it
B0061S073A|5.0|I like the easy switch of this app my little kids are not noticing it. Thanks a lot. Recommend it to parents to prevent unwanted charges!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I had to have a copy of this movie.  Fanciful, charming and creative writing.  Great acting and a wonderful escape movie!

B001P59V5Y|4.0|This movie  rates as one of my favorite Monty Python films.  Typical Python humor at its best as the troupe takes on the Christian faith.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was of highest quality.  I have the Kindle HD and it was like I was there, fantastic.  I recommend
0061655554|5.0|If you have never read a business book before, this is a great place to start.  While this is not my personal favorite business book (that would be Reminiscence of a Stock Operator), I will concede that it is the best business book ever written.<br /><br />This book perfectly captures a period in time that was in retrospect one of the biggest transitions in American business history as the power shifted away from management teams and towards shareholders.  As shareholders gained more power, however, the \\"family\\" aspects of many businesses also disappeared.  It also captures the end of the LBO craze fueled by junk bonds that defined the 80s.<br /><br />The authors do a great job of telling a compelling story while withholding judgement.  They smartly avoid the preachy moralizing you find in similar books by James B. Stewart and Bethany Mclean.
B0012Y1J3K|5.0|The music is great - but we all know that. I love the performances, although I've not yet done the vocal/choral works (which are lower on my priority list anyway).<br /><br />Maybe the others can help out here: where is the famous lullaby? It's not the 4th or 1st Symphony by any means, but it is famous, many of us can hum it, and it would be nice to have it on a truly professional recording. It isn't on any of my other CDs I've bought over the years (which don't have a lot of the lesser-performed works that this boxed set has). Maybe it's named something I didn't recognize: I went through the listings on the backs of the sleeves and didn't see it. Didn't hear it, either.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was the best app because the movement of the horse is so lifelike. I love this game! Get It.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. The book is well written, the story flows well and it has an ending that concludes the story and does not leave you hanging.  It is a touching story of the lives of Louisa and Will and how they connect with each other and the difference they make in each others lives. I would recommend this book to other readers.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you love the Dark Knight series, then this is a must have! I love that it has all 3 together and a nice book to boot!
B00B0NDQPC|4.0|I am a big fan of the talented and versatile Emmy Rossum.  I like the style of music in this concept album. Emmy's rendition of Autumn Leaves is outstanding. My only disappointment is don't particularly like a few of the songs. As far as Emmy Rossum is concerned, she is a real talent, and I look forward to more music from her in the future.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Awesome game. Lots of fun.<br />Challenging. Kids love it. Adults love it. We play first thing in the morning and laugh out loud!
B00005M91K|5.0|I got what I asked for and I'm elated.  This was priced at a vast amount but it's worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very good idea that came to life.  The only thing is that it gets kind of obsessive.
B001MSMULG|2.0|I'm about a third thru the book and I'm still finding it hard to really get into the story and I'm having to push myself to keep reading.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|This book... i really liked it, at first, but that stupid, horrible ending and all the stupid thingsthat happened made me really angry and frustrated!  Kay, first of all,wtf! seriously? you make Clary pick Jace over Simon and then decide, what, you know what know one would see coming? Let's make the biggest sibling love plot twist since Luke and Leia. You know what this book needs? A little bit of good, old fashioned incest. No, Ms. Clare, this book does not need a leia luke relationship, and it REALLY does not need any form of incest!!! And you know what else i hated about that, it was predictable! I think I knew exactly what would happen before it actually happened. And, by the way, at the perspective of a teenage girl, I can honestly tell you that if I found out that a boy I think I might love and have kissed, aggresively i might add, I'm positive that I'd be a little more upset finding out that he was my blood related brother! Clary's attitude was just, oh well, guess Dorothea was right, Jace did fall in love with the wrong person. That bothered me A LOT!!!!!!!!!! In conclusion, i wish i would've kept thee six dollars this crap cost me and would've instead bought a good book with no sibling love or this amount of predictiveness, or maybe just sat outside in the snow and imagined my own story. It would be less painful.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly, and this was another of his novels that I just couldn't put down!  The Lincoln Lawyer was one of my favorites, and this one followed suit, perfectly!  I loved how the title is finally revealed in the plot.  Just another terrific novel from one of the best writers of this genre.
B009POCFTG|4.0|it contains some scenes that are filled will violence and nudity. I would not recomend it for children. It's geared more for older people.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Reading each book has made me useless for the daily chores.  I cannot keep the book down once I get over the first 4 chapters and got the momentum going.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The app works well but all the ads that take over and require you to skip or take some action at every game is too much.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is written in such an entertaining way that you forget you're reading about deep history of medicine and how surgery essentially began.  Wonderfully laid out! Highly recommend to everyone!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed the &#34;Slammed&#34; books and was eager to see what else Colleen Hoover had up her sleeve.  This book is a mystery that unravels as the pages turn.  I liked almost everything - except I think that the ending was a little too abrupt.  I would imagine Sky will need many years of therapy after all she goes through!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This one needs a little more concentration on my part.I play for hours at a time, great stres reliever. Mariyn Allen
B0018QQQK8|5.0|As all of Nicholas Sparks books this is a wonderful love story with just enough twist.  I highly recommend this book!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loved the different games,  different levels from simple to not so simple. Keeps you entertained for hours., great fun alone or with my child. Marilyn Allen
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|The music is wonderful, but the soundtrack is missing many of the songs from the movie. I was dissapointed when I realized I hadn't bought the full version. Wait until they come out with a two disc set!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is a really horrible game it has words u don't know that u can learn to spell every day in the daily language challenge we do that in school already I mean r u hidden me. Sometimes it is fun seeing the characters skateboard and stuff but this game is just a rip off of temple run .
B00992CF6W|5.0|when can there be the 0.6.1 update coming because I have the update on my ipad but not on my kindle fire please have the update on the kindles please<br /><br />Things in the 0.6.0 update are baby animals,armour,quartz and now when you make the nether reactor it turns into netherrack.
B001JIFYSA|2.0|I did not find any of the character's even remotely likeable. There is little depth to any of the characters, not a feel good movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun way to pass the time when waiting on something else to do.  My daughter also loves this game. The  competition part actually takes a littleskill.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Although there was really nothing original about this story, I enjoyed it nonetheless!  That is, until the very end, when Sparks had to go and ruin it for me!  Why did he have to go and push it one step too far and add that nonsense about Katie/Erin's &#34;discovery&#34; about her neighbor, Jo?!?!??  I really have to stop getting sucked in to Sparks' novels!  It's hard to take him seriously as an author anymore!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great for a free download.  I played the original until I maxed out all my upgrades.  I was happy to see a sequel and have not felt disappointed except for the game freezing occasionally when trying to use a jewel to continue.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has heart and soul. How this author captured a dog's perspective is beyond me! Wonderful read, even if you're not a dog lover!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a good app.Great equipment and mobs,but the nether core reactor's obsidian can only be mined by a diomond pickaxes,and you cannot make a nether portal.The best world seed would be Juan,because I found 15 diomonds,&lt;100 iron,and &lt;49 butter.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I don't like violence so I can't give it 5 stars, but this movie was interesting, entertaining and action filled
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and productive. I teaches kids both hand-eye coordination and how to manage coins and money. But this game isn't just for kids it keeps adults and teenagers entertained. With new themes and characters each month it is surely always going to keep you on edge. It is fast pace and fun. You will never get board with it. Subway surfer also has different power ups and levels that will help engage you and have fun.I would recommend this game to everyone and all ages.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and it was filmed really well.  I don't know how much the historical facts are made up, but I found it interesting from a historical point of view.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've played since well..... Ever!<br />You jump on trains roll under and over signs but don't bump into stuff
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should make a new version but saying that it is a  brilliant game If this game came in shop and it was $100 I will still buy it look at the rate that I put out of it<br /><br />That's the how much I am happy<br /><br /> if you predict a new version.Thank you Jake Smith
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!!!! It great!!!!. I think it's a wonderful game. My friend has this app too. It's FREE!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|To every man out there it's hard being a man in today's world with pornography,the world telling men that we are not important in our marriages, well we are! Men love and cherish the family that god In-trusted you, be involved in your children's lives, discipline them, tell them that living a godly life is important and that Jesus Christ is God, this is the truth men live your lives to please him and only him. And one more thing, love and respect your bride and tell her that she is beautiful and special and that god blessed you with her, god bless you.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The games was fun but some what easy for me to finish.  Even if you finish it quick it's still a fun game to go back and play again.
B007HGPBRC|1.0|I can't read this book because it keeps asking me to rate it that's is so stupid to ask someone to rate it if the reader hasn't read the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun that me and my friends had a contest. I just love it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it! It's so much better than the first one. It's more challenging as well making it require more concentration.
1594488886|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. It truly depicted life for women in Afghanistan in a totally realistic and sympathic story. I liked this book even better than the author's more well known novel, Kite Runner.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I've read this book 4 times now, and it never gets old! It is a must read. I can't wait to re-read the whole trilogy. Throne of Fire here I come!
0345541588|1.0|This story started out interesting enough, with a suicide of a young woman, on a train, but soon sunk to an aimless search for the reasons for this suicide, with one boring, endless & action-less goose chase after another. Just when think think there will be some sort of conflict, Jack Reacher always seems to get out of the situation without swinging a fist, shooting someone, or just making the story interesting for the reader. This is my first Jack Reacher novel, and judging from the lackluster way this novel was written, probably my last. I say probably, because every novelist occasionally comes out with  a boring novel, and for the author's sake, I hope this wasn't his best effort. A novel without conflict is boring, and the only conflict I experienced while reading this story was to ask myself, why I was bothering with it. Needless to say, I didn't bother finishing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run but this version rocks!<br />I enjoy testing my reflexes by playing temple run and temple run
B002VKE0XA|5.0|The movie itself is, well, meh.  It's good, but borrows from a lot of genre predecessors.  What makes the difference is atmospherics.  I've got a pretty ridiculous home theater with Martin Logans and Denon and Oppo blah, blah, blah.  I turned up the sub and had it going in surround and what a difference.<br /><br />Without the sub, the movie lacked a tremendous amount of \\"terror\\" that comes with the setting and atmosphere.  For instance, when you knew something spooky was going to happen and the aural \\"fog\\" came in my sub went nuts.  Granted, it's a Paradigm 250 watt RMS sub but you get the point. And when the first real terror point hits as something pounds the headboard my whole theater lit up.  Wow.<br /><br />Watched on TV speakers or without a sub this movie loses much of its appeal.  But crank up the surround and the sub and your whole room becomes a coffin...just as the director planned.<br /><br />Overall, definitely a scarefest of significant proportions if you've got a good surround system.  I do.  So two thumbs up.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|They are wonderful together and I can't wait for there next cd and I hope to still hear their amazing voices for years to come thank you both for the chance to enjoy your cd  wonderful
B004IAR4Q6|5.0|Definitely a feel good album that reminds me why he was so popular in the first place. For people who like blues like I do, this is a great album.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|but I was wrong. This show is so engaging, and the development of the lead characters and their 'friendship' (for want of a better word, although the series suggests that Sherlock doesn't have friends) is one of the things that makes it so watchable. The others are the plots, which are often very clever and always interesting, and the actors. To a person, they give excellent performances and make you forget they are anyone other than the characters they portray, which can be difficult if you are immediately recognizable. I will be really disappointed if there is no Season 2.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I prefer this game because the player has three distinct games to play. I especially like the dig game. Lots of rolling puzzles to figure out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|As another \\"messed up\\" person in a world full of messed up people, the rare honesty with which these characters are written is heart breaking and uplifting at once.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is wonderful to watch a show that is witty and subtle like Downton. I only wish there were more than 7 or 8 episodes (series) per season.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|nobody puts Janey in the corner. i wouldn't dream of giving her less than 5 stars. Ms. Austen always gets 5 stars. and they all live happily ever after. the end.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I worked really hard and got 70045 coins and unlocked most people it took me a long time. then I opened to play and the game started over all my people coins and place were gone!
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John Hiatt continues to churn out solid country-influenced rock and roll.  He never disappoints.  On first listen, there are a couple of gems in here.  Of course, I have my John Hiatt favorites (Drive South, Icy Blue Heart, Have a Little Faith) so comparing to that is perhaps not fair.  But it won't disappoint.
1401937519|5.0|I have not completed this book as of yet; however, so far, I have enjoyed the style of writing.  It is very interesting in that it touches on the writer's life and the milestones within it.  I can't wait to finish reading the book and see what insight she has regarding her near-death experience.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a family member rebuilding his Disney library after it went missing in a household move.  Received it on time and in great condition.  This is a GREAT way to build a library.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Even if you have seen this movie, you really need to see it on BluRay! Gave it to my niece for Christmas and she has watched it at least 5 times since then.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is definitely better, with more complex trails and uses for your coins DURING the game, and has many new elements(ziplines, minecarts, hills, barrels of death, etc.. There`s less characters, but more powerups and enhanced graphics. Although, it` easier. There are gems that give you extra lives, and shields that let you take a hit. But, i can`t blame imangi studios, because otherwise, you wouldn`t get past 2,500m. If you have the first one, you should still get it. It`s a new experience &amp; will stop your kids from whining, &quot; BUT EVERYONE ELSE HAS ONE :(!&quot; It`s worth the money the money ($0 plus the money you pay for Wi-Fi access),but whether it`s worth the memorie space depends on what apps you have. It`s less addictive, possibly due to more quiet music soundin` like a lul-a-by. The fact that it has a GIANT  demon monkey doesn`t effect the game. The controls are the same and so is the genre (endless game).  .  RECOMMENDED!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely addicted to this series, the best, the best show ever !!! Can watch all episodes over and over, thanks!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet did an exceptional job of telling the complex and dysfunctional path that led us to WWI. I was completely enthralled from the start to finish. The stories of the families and their diverse struggles allowed the reader to empathize with all sides to some extent. This book may not satisfy a true historians need for extensive details, but as someone who loves history and the stories it tells, I truly enjoyed it.
0670026182|5.0|What a great book! I've made three dinners out of it so far & each has been fantastic - clear directions, wonderful flavor a, and inspiring photos. This one has definitely earned it place on my bookshelf!
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was a book that keeps you on your toes and has a lot of historical facts to back up the story line.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses so this app is fun. I wish it was easier to earn gems though. It takes a long time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it<br />So intense hit,heavy,romantic,controller,can't wait to read other sets<br />Keep writing books like this so couples can be happy
B003L77G8I|5.0|This is an amazing and addicting show. Jumping in in the middle might be problematic. In that case, just buy all the seasons and start with episode one!!
1470056496|5.0|Fanny Price, a timid and gentle nine year old, is uprooted from her impoverished home in Portsmouth to live with her wealthy relations in Northampton. Of them all, only righteous Cousin Edmund has any idea of her loneliness amidst the splendours of Mansfield Park and he sets out to befriend her. His kindness has the inevitable result and Fanny grows evermore attached to him as she grows into her subservient position in the household.<br /><br />As she reached young adulthood, Sir Thomas is called over to the West Indies to investigate problems on the plantation which is the source of the family's riches and at this point Dr and Mrs Grantley (the clergyman who has the local living) introduce Mrs Grantley's sister and brother to the neighbourhood. Mary and Henry Crawford are irreverent, socially sophisticated and captivatingly good company. Edmund falls in love with the unsuitable Mary and Henry causes havoc with the hearts of the Bertram sisters, Julia and Maria. Fanny watches with a stern and judgemental eye.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book - full of grotesques : the horrid, mean, bullying Aunt Norris, Lady Bertram who never has the energy to move off her sofa or Sir Thomas Bertram, full of rectitude but unable to see how his parenting is stunting the growth of his daughters.<br /><br />We see more of the dark side of early nineteenth century life than is usual in Jane Austen's novels - Sir Thomas's association with the slave trade, the shocking poverty of Fanny's family in Portsmouth (her description of the milk which is served there (\\"motes floating in blue liquid\\") seems to sum up the whole ill-managed and depressing household or the seaman who is brutally whipped on one of William Price's ships.<br /><br />Fanny may not be a heroine the reader can fall in love with but she is the heroine of a multi-layered book which can be read again and again.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|You will want to watch every single episode back to back to back to back. This is the most addicting show ever made. All of the actors do an amazing job and are 100% believable. Great job Homeland!!! Please everyone buy this and tell your friends and family to buy this so this show can stay on the air!!
1572814136|5.0|Love the Rider Waite deck, this one as brighter more eye easy and pleasing colors! Would recommend for purchase! Great
B0053O89WY|5.0|Somehow this show just keeps getting funnier and funnier!! It is so worth buying all the seasons. Also glad to see Penny and Leonard back together..
B004P8JPS6|4.0|What can I say, I enjoy a thinking mans game.  Read and try to figure what you would do .  I hope they make more movies of the series, but use someone other than Cruise, there as to be an actor out there with some size to him, more like the actual character in the series, hell I'm 6'3&#34; and 240 closer to Jack Reachers size than Cruise is, just to old now.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is amazing. it gives you a close experience with a horse but without he work. it doesn't have the same feel as an actual horse but its close enough. if you dang have an actual horse
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift. Received free downloads with tickets purchased to see Gary Clark Jr. in Boston. Bought this for my son because he likes the hard copies, and usually gets them autographed!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a addicting game that I love to play. I play it when I wake up yo when I fall asleep
B003L20IJM|5.0|I have passed up this movie on television many times.  Thinking another sequel - sometimes and usually they are you know.... But I started watching and it pulled me in and was EVERY BIT as wonderful as the Nanny McPhee first movie!!!  I went right to Amazon and bought a copy for my Collection - I had to own one for myself - the tv won't play it often enough.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm so caught up with Gideon and Eva's story. I'm hoping that there's a happy ending to there love story!
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I watched this movie last night on tv - then went right to Amazon to buy it!!  They will never play it enough on television to keep me happy.  I like this actress SO much anyways, but had no idea how great she'd be in this movie.  I only intended on watching it a couple of minutes - then got pulled in so fast I watched it till the ending.. THEN went right to Amazon to buy!
B000056HE9|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Gotta say that acting back in the day was much better than today.  Must be why I like the old movies.  This is a very good movie, uplifting.  Interesting note, a couple of the younger actors in the movie starred in &#34;It's a Wonderful Life.&#34;  I believe the Bishop's little girl played JuJu, and one of the young men in TBW played the young George Bailey who worked in the soda shop.  Who doesn't love Loretta Young, was such a beautiful and talented actress.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I'm probably the last person to buy a copy of this Harry Potter number 1.  I saw it on television the other day and it reminded me how wonderful it was.  The following Harry Potters got so sophisticated in technology and fast paced, that I had a hard time keeping up - they were more &#34;work&#34; for me to watch and concentrate.  But I LOVE the fantasy of this first release and will NEVER tire watching it I'm positive.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Really good game but a little fast-paced also, only one waiter and to get more like 400 heart points? I doesn't seem very fair but hello kitty is super cute!
B000FC13MM|5.0|Entertaining to the very last line. Characters have depth. Plot is quite predictable but this book lays a good foundation for the second one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as fun and addicting as the first one. I enjoy the rollercoaster style trails more then the flat trails of the first one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good workout and can be a nice boost!  I'm a walk at home fan and bought this dvd as a challenge from a friend that didn't think my Leslie Sansone workouts could be challenging enough.  You do more squats here and lunges but I was able to keep up and didn't feel like I was dying like my friend swore I would be.  Frankly, I like my other workouts better but throw this one in to do more targeted workouts from time to time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a cool book and I hope you can make more so that is a cool book hope you can write more
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me being the competitive person I am... I have to beat everyone everything. So this was the perfect game to beat everyone in. It's soooo addictive and I can't put this game down everr!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This and Mad Men are the two best shows on television.  We love this program and can't get enough of it.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The story line is good and the music is incredible, but the foul language (mostly coming from girls' mouths) and sexual references and innuendo really detract from the movie's entertainment.  The jokes are in very poor taste and are lewd and vulgar.  However, the music is fantastic. It's a shame that this movie could have been clean and rated PG and many more people would have probably been drawn to this show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|addicting is all I have to say. once younplay it one time you cant stop. my whole family got addicted
B002361MLA|4.0|Very enlighting! A little dry at times.takes time to read to absorb and understand the books meaning.very interesting!will read several parts over to absorb it's meaning.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Exellent plot but cheesy execution.  Movie could have been more captivating.  I really did not feel involved with what I was watching.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Completely useless. Stay away. Luckily I got it for free so I just uninstalled. I would strongly suggest that no one get this!
B00127RAJY|4.0|3 20 minute workouts that are tough.  Love doing these on days that I don't run.  They always make me sweat and I am usually a little sore the next day. I feel like I get a great cardio/strength workout even though it is only 20 minutes long.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|This good read is fundamentally a history of one book's impact on early Renaissance Europe.  According to the author, once Lucretius' &#34;On The Nature of Things&#34; was re-discovered by ancient scroll-seeking scholars it contributed to the rise of the humanist movement encouraged many influential scholars, artists, and scientists to think beyond the narrow confines of the Roman Catholic Church's world view.  The most enjoyable parts of the book for me were the many digressions into how ancient scrolls were made, the nature of monastic life in the middle ages, and intrigue at the Vatican during turbulent times.  Occasionally the author spends perhaps a bit too much time -- and too much glee for just an intellectual history -- pointing out the many [many] flaws of Christianity and Roman Catholicism.  These sections of the book become repetitive, but they don't last long.  Overall, it is a very interesting read and often entertaining, as well.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|My honest opinion here. It's just movie just like every other movie out there. People really get upset over the first few minutes of this film over the torture scene. Here's how I feel about this Osama killed over 2,000 innocent people the past 15 plus years. If the United States needed to find him by all means I'm fine with it. Those who find it offensive or too much I guess you forgot 9/11 the USS Cole and all the other crap Bin Laden did. Remember it's just a movie you don't have to watch it or hate it because of one scene.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun<br />I really like this game the camera action is good maybe it could be improved by adding more motion to the patting and treating screen
B008518MOW|5.0|This was a birthday present for my husband. It is a fun movie like the other 2 in the sequel. Great value.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Being a 2nd year birder, I didn't know how serious birding was until I saw this film.  I liked the movie, any birder will.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Found the book fairly slow at the first.pretty good ending.not overly well written in my estimation.I expect more from Grisham
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a fantastic expansion on the original temple run. It keeps the same style of game and the same aspects of playability while changing enough and adding enough new ideas to make it a whole new game. One of the best games out there!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each season of Downton Abbey gets better and better. One of the most entertaining programs currently on TV. Thank you PBS for an exceptional program. Maggie Smith has some of the funniest lines!
B00633W614|5.0|Love this book!  Another great Jeffrey Archer read. This story kept me going the whole time. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

B008KE3960|3.0|its a pretty good game. its a nice time killer when you have nothing else to do at the time.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|I'm a firm believer in this album. That 1916 is just as good as Ace Of Spades in its own league. For bands to keep trucking on like Motorhead has is rare, for a band to release an album like this, even in their prime, is even more rare. We start off with The One To Sing The Blues, one of the fast paced songs off the track and doesn't disappoint except I want more of it! I feel like it ends too soon, but it is a great track. I'm So Bad Baby (I Don't Care) carries over the energy from the first track and has a punk rock vibe about it. It is a good solid rock album and should be a classic song from Lemmy. No Voices In The Sky is an energetic track and practically says the truth about the world we live in today. Going To Brazil has a blusey tone to it but I'm not really a fan of this track. It has an old school rock n roll feel to it and Lemmy really delievers I guess I expected more compared to the first three songs. Nightmare/The Dreamtime is sort of creepy but boring once you get into the three minute mark. Love Me Forever, wow. Incredibly dark, gloomy, and depressing. Lemmy really delievers on this track. Its heavy as well. You can feel the pain radiate from this track. Angel City changes the mood back to upbeat and gets you ready for a good time! But has the same qualities as Going To Brazil, still retains the same old school rock n roll tone to it but it is just hard for me to get into. Make My Day, is done in typical Motorhead fashion. Lemmy plays the biker bad guy talking about a girl and resembles a track you could have heard from \\"Another Perfect Day.\\" Ramones is the next track and as any old metal fan, or punk fan can tell, it will have a punksih vibe to it and I'm not complaining really like this track and fits in perfectly. Shut You Down is a fast paced rocker and uplifts the mood right before the final epic track with its painfully true lyrics and theme. 1916, World War I. Motorhead decides to do a tribute and it becomes on of their most lyrically amazing songs ever. Metallica had \\"One\\" Megadeth had \\"Holy Wars\\" and 1916 ranks up there with the best and is told from the view point of a young soldier in this living hell that is called 1916. The drums make this track more powerful simply because of the military sounding theme. Overall, this is one of Motorhead's most mature efforts and one of their bests. I'm really glad I have this in my personal collection.songs ever.

B00005JN8Z|4.0|This film is spectacular in it breadth of coverage, in its photograhy, in its cast of thousands, and in its outstanding acting performances especially that of Pter Ustinov who is memorable as Nero. For the Christian viewer, it is a reminder of just how difficult it was to be a Christian in the beginning. For the movie buff, it is a spectacular film, technologically. It is beter viewed on a large screen as much of the visual will be lost on a smaller screen.<br /><br />It is simply a great film that should be in any collection of film clasics.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played! I love it! If you don't like this game you are crazy!

I have always been very \\"vanilla\\" and never would have thought that this book or the topic would have been my \\"cup of tea\\" but now i find my self wishing i had a bigger house and that my husband to read and manipulate his hand at the same time so we could read together. OO LA LA...
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I have had the unit for about six months now.  To be clear, this is a great monitor for portability and to see your children while away at work or wherever. Yes, two second delay. This was annoying. At first but I got used to it.  We still use a regular in home video monitor for the baby but the withings is used for my three year old and to take with us if we go somewhere.  It will drain your battery on your phone if you are streaming so please be aware of that.  I think it is great that my wife and I can always jump on and see what is going on at home with our phone or ipad.
B008B92U32|4.0|but, If there are more than 2 faces in a picture I have not yet found a way to easily choose which face I want where. Also it would be great if you could swap faces between two photos.  But still its fun and I did<br />laugh out loud at a couple of the results it came up with.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|I remember this book when it came out.  It seemed like it was everywhere. When I finally read it, I hadn't expected it to have so many references to Russian culture.<br /><br />McCandless, who gave away $25,000 to end hunger and then died of hunger in the Alaskan wilderness, was a big follower of Tolstoy.<br /><br />He was idealistic and inflexible, like Tolstoy.  He caused great pain to his family, like Tolstoy.  He ran away to die in an obscure place, like Tolstoy.  However, Tolstoy didn't really get away and Astapovo, the little railway stop he died at, was overrun with journalists.  McCandless didn't have anyone present, but he did attract Krakauer, and that was sufficient.<br /><br />Krakauer spends a lot of time defending McCandless, while others have attacked him.  Again, shades of Tolstoy.  There is a certain kind of inflexible sense of self-sacrifice and setting oneself apart from the rest of society that they both shared.  One place where they were quite different was in sexual styles.  Tolstoy had an intense sex drive, and even when he demanded celibacy of himself, he ended up disappointing himself.  McCandless seems to have had an altogether easier time in following Tolstoy's teachings in this matter than the master did.<br /><br />The structure of the book is quite complex. It moves back and forth in time and setting quite a bit and yet still manages to keep a real sense of suspense. We know from the start that McCandless isn't getting out alive, and yet we are glued to the page, reading to find out why he did it more than anything else. He is a classic likable but flawed character.<br /><br />Towards the end, there's an extended remembrance from Krakauer himself on his climb of the Devil's Thumb near Petersburg, AK. This is to show that both of them did stupid things, but Krakauer survived, and so could McCandless, if he'd had better luck.  But then if McCandless had just taken a map, he would have been fine. Tolstoy made people crazy, too, though, with his ideas of how things would have to be.<br /><br />He just didn't change his mind, no matter what people said.  We can see the same here. Despite Krakauer's defense, it still seems clear that an inflexible moralism and wilderness living are not the best of partners.<br /><br />But part of the power of the narrative derives from its quasi-religious narrative structure.  Isn't this really a visiting of the stations of the cross?  If McCandless didn't die, the narrative wouldn't have its associative power.h his ideas of how things would have to be.<br /><br />He just didn't change his mind, no matter what people said.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|Amazingly well done for its time. Basically it meets the level of old James Bond movies. Quality of Blu ray is very good - sound and vision. A keeper.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game was recommended to me by my daughter's family.  I thouroughly enjoy playing this game.  Warning:  It is addictive!
B001AGXEA6|2.0|First time I saw this movie. What can I say, probably, Burton's fans would disagree with me but I believe it is a shallow, primitive, very uneven movie. Not a keeper at all. Blu ray is ok, but not great.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|so I downloaded this app because it looked fun and. it was free. so I start playing the game and the kindle fire original is lint detecting my movements ans<br />d it keeps making me die. I know some people are going to think I am just not a good player but I am and the kindle fire original is just not picking up my movements<br />...inform me atleast.
B007NESBK2|3.0|Overrated blu ray. CD - the Best of Sade is all you need, quality is better. To see Sade performing somewhat disappointing, expected more.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Just an excellent book. For me I just completely enjoy All of Mitch Albom's books!<br />I am not a writer nor a good critic. Each reader must decide on their own
B0014BQQYS|2.0|If you like this movie as your memory it is probably fine, otherwise it is a predictable, poorly staged old movie. Robert Redford is not a good actor after all, just good looking. Blu Ray is OK.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|An interesting and mind consuming book of fiction, Or is it really fiction????.<br /> For me I just completely enjoy All of Mitch Albom's books!<br />I am not a writer nor a good critic. Each reader must decide on their own

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really amazing. It lets me do things with my own horse. I really like that, also I've always wanted a horse so this is as close as I'll get to one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Its an ap that is more accurate than Weather Bug or the Weather Channel ones. Only drawback is that it doesn't include an hour by hour forecast.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Free app is just a useless video that does not do anything at all. Why would you even bother with downloading this thing to take up space on your tablet or phone?
0307950654|5.0|As a big Jane Austin fan, and especially a &#34; Pride and Prejudice fan, I am always ready to read new adaptations. This one is very. well written and held my interest from beginning to end. Thank you P.D. JAmes! A great mystery!

B00AA7O22U|5.0|Awesome better than part 1. Highly recommend to everyone. Youll love it. Trust me im a crktic of action movies
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I like to order DVDs for my library if they have a timeless story.  War Horse will be a great movie, today or 50 years from today, which is why I rate it as a classic.  The story is about a horse conscripted for the British army for service in WW1.  My grandchildren have watched this movie so many times that they know the dialogue by heart.  There isn't anything a child can't see in this movie unless they are frightened by war themes.  It contains several battle scenes which might frighten a young child, but the overall story has a feel good ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it cannot be anymore better than it already is<br /><br />WHEN my mom took away my kindle I was disappointed because I could not play my favorite game:/

B001NYVY8O|5.0|This album has tons of funny content. The whole thing with Ben Stiller at the end is absolutely priceless. Worth the money...get the entire album.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book.  The stories within the concentration camp held my interest....to the point of not wanting to put the book down.  Then, the second half of the book related to pscyhology and left me a little flat.  Seemed a bit repetativie and didn't hold my interest as much as the first half of the book.  I would still recommend the book...as the first half was written very well and was enlightning.
B001A81CYY|5.0|Fun music. Limp has always been one of my favorites.  Daughter listens to them to get fired up for her volleyball games.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|Three months and counting.  Some of the best albums I have owned haven't lasted that long in the tray.  This album is well written, and will probably stay on the playlist for alot longer.
B0046ECFRM|3.0|The book was okay for YA romance. The problem was that Anna was totally selfish and self-absorbed for about 90% of the book. It was quite tiring at times to read. A bit too much over dramatic angst for most of it
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Well orchestrated mess of chaos and metal.  Another great album from this band.  Heavy deep bass, violent vocals mixed with the standard mix of wailing guitars and creative lyrics.  Well done.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Life of Pi gripped me from the very first page.  I look forward to seeing the film, and hope I won't be disappointed, since I visualized Pi, Richard, and Pi's family in my mind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We had heard a lot about this show but season 1 seemed slow.  Each season is better and better.  Season 3 the best so far.  I guess it's because we know everyone better and can't wait to see what happens next!
0547884591|5.0|I got this for my girl friend and she loves it.  Apparently the way this guy writes is phenomenal.  The recipes seem a little out there though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and the world tour makes it even better I really recommend this app you should get it really
0316010669|5.0|We had to read this book for my psychology class and I'm glad we did.  Some of the book does seem to have a lot of fluff and speculation but the effects that are talked about are very interesting and make the book a worthwhile read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The style of writing was very different so it took more attention to get &#34;into it&#34;.  I had to reread the first couple of chapter to undersand what was going on.  As I read through it, I still questioned--why was this book so highly rated.  I kept with it though; taking a much longer time to read it than usual.  Very disappointed with the ending.  I want a conclusion not the one that was chosen.  I certainly would not recommend it to any one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, especially if you have kids that enjoy horses.  They will play for hours if you let them! (Of course nobody says you have to)
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This CD hits almost all the highlights from the film. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the movie! Only one thing I would change - 'Blood of Angry Men' isn't included.
B0016ITO98|5.0|Wonderful movie! Came in excellent condition! My favorite movie ! Best version ever made! My husband and I laugh every time we watch it.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I loved this movie! The suspense was fantastic. The image quality was really good, but this movie took forever to load and constantly stopped to buffer. The film is great, but prepare some time to let it load.
B007TTFXC0|5.0|loved all of the songs would get any of her c d s i have no more to say just geting all number of words in
B009MCRHH6|4.0|The gameplay is challenging and really makes you think to decipher clues left behind. I got this game as a free app one day, and I think it's pretty fun, but I don't think I would purchase it.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Love the play of darkness in this movie, it brings to light alot of what the story was always missing. The not only self absorbed step-mother queen, but dark and devious, stealing life with beauty. Loved it!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I thought this game was a really fun, creative spinoff of the popular Angry Birds games. Just like the earlier games, it is easy to learn even for young children. Building the pigs' contraptions was a lot of fun!
B007SRZULW|3.0|This book was fun but long.<br />I'm sort of an impatient reader, plus I'm more of an action packed book reader,but it was masterfully written.<br />If I have to read a book about tea and dances this is the one I'd pick.<br />It's pretty fun for a Romance and I found myself hoping she would find her prince.<br />Pride and prejudice is about a girl from a family of like four sisters and no brothers, so their all knight in shining armour chasers except for their father who manages to remain sane.<br />If you like the book you might also like the movie.<br />I know I do, I had a hard time getting through the book.<br />But like I said I'm an impatient reader and I'd prefer to read the Lord of the rings or I am number four.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|I have always liked anything that has Denzel Washington playing in.It  a very good movie and it will keep you watching it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty entertaining. don't like the hiving to sign up for stuff to get points. however you can earn a lot by just playing the games.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|This a grate movie to watch,comes with a good action movie and a movie that keeps your attention from start to finish.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Came on time and it works! Don't really know what else to say about it other than it made my son very happy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty awesome<br />I like this game had on like it on a computer but was really dumb this one is cool.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Entertaining story-line that leads you to believe that you know the evil mastermind's identity until the end. Then, you find out who the mastermind really is.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It is very long its over 900 pages. Also if you are a younger person like in middle school or maybe evan your first year in highschool it will make no sense to you at all. I loved I understood it,and it made me keep readind on and on. Though for some people it will be very boring evan if you understand it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love to play this game on my free time. It is the best game ever. I love this game
B00992CF6W|3.0|I downloaded this app and I absolutely love it! I have it for the Kindle Fire 8.9&quot; and its awesome! I have to say its one of the best games I have downloaded. The only thing that really upsets me about this game on the Kindle Fire, is that since its not an apple product, the updates arent available the same time the updates are available for the Apple products. So since the updates aren't available at the same time, if someone you know has an apple product and their minecraft is updated, you cant play in the same game as them because their world is updated and yours isnt. It's really annoying because I want to be able to play with my friends but now I can't until the updated version of minecraft for the Kindle Fire is available. You also dont know when its gonna be available!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This version is not just like the PC and the Xbox, but it is by far the best of my animated apps. The game still has some issues like it won't let me update it,but that's okay I guess.
B002JODV3S|5.0|The best concert i've ever watched or witnessed. The virtuosity of the great Vai is beyond anything i've seen. The sounds, the background of venue, and not to mention the quality of his backing musicians... It's just simply an amazing concert. It's highly recomended to anyone who likes quality music. I watched this on a home cinema and it feels like i was there.<br /><br />Best 20 bucks ever spent haha.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is nice that the cards are easy to read.  Entertaining game.  I really like the &quot;auto-finish &quot; feature.  I like to play this when I am waiting.
B008476HBM|5.0|detail and descriptive language.  Some of the material in the book was pertinent to todays life.  Hard to believe it was written 200 yea ago.
0547848412|4.0|This is a complex, at times fast-paced book, full of drama and terror.  It is also one that demonstrates the strength, survival, and ingenuity of the human spirit.  It is both spiritual and religious, and I must admit that I skipped parts of the details of Pi's religious beliefs and experiences.  However, this takes nothing away from the author's writing skills.  The ending was a surprise, and I was left wondering.
B00AJER3SE|1.0|Let me be clear.  I LOVE this film.  I've owned many copies, however, I will NEVER EVER buy it when it doesn't come with the original mono track,  the &#34;revised&#34; stereo track is NOT superior, and completely detracts from ones ability to enjoy the film.  I dont't fault them for trying a stereo track, but there is NO ACCEPTABLE REASON to not include the original mono.  There will be future releases, so please join me in holding out for a PROPER release with the mono track.  I have no Blu-Ray of the film now, and never will (even for free) until the mono tack is included.  Respectfully submitted.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is the 3rd Bruce Springsteen's CD I've purchased, and I must admit to loving all of his songs equally.  I enjoy his down-to-earth singing and his moving renditions of hard-working people whose lifes are often one of struggle and strength.  His passion comes through each song.  I've become, late in life, a huge fan of the &#34;boss&#34;!
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I am a huge Clapton fan and own over 20 albums from throughout his career starting with John Mayall. But I never had Slowhand. It's been on my list, but so are countless others and I already had the songs from other CD's in my collection. Then when the 35th anniversary addition came out, I couldn't resist any longer. The extra songs drew me toward my purchase. Some I did not previously own. And I love his live concerts, so the extra disc was a definite plus for me.<br />I've read other reviews. Not all agree, but to me, it's just about the man and listening to him play.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've only gotten to the first two main levels (Greece and Rome), but I'm enjoying the game so far. Its not a high-stress fast moving game, and the music is soothing. Perfect to relax after a long day.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Hollywood should recognize that with great story telling and actors, as exhibited in Downton Abbey, special effects and simulated violence is not required to be a financial success in the United States.  Americans are hungry for quality works of art.  It amazing the amount of great talent that was brought together in a TV series.  The Academy should take exception to recognize the quality that is Downton Abbey.<br /><br />I hope the series continues non-stop.  The Bluray version is the way to watch the series.  The color and sound are superb.  Broadcasting HD via the Internet cannot come close to what you can see from a Blu-ray Disc.  the Brits know how to produce quality entertainment.  Bravo!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even better than the original, this game offers a new twist on the original Temple Run with new scenery in the form of a floating, forgotten city, a jungle, and an abandoned mine. The ability to not only run, but zipline and maneuver a railroad cart makes the game even more interesting.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I was led to this book by the recent movie, &#34;Lincoln.&#34; While the events described in the movie only take about two or three pages in the book, the story of Lincoln's use of his political rivals to craft a successful administration against the greatest odds is a lesson for our time. You wonder if Barack Obama read this book before asking Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Grandchildren enjoy this game downloaded for the Kindle Fire.  Since she received this for her birthday she enjoys hours of entertainment!
B00AFEY354|5.0|A brilliant, beautiful, inspiring movie, not just another high school movie like I thought.<br />a loner Charlie (Logan Lerman)looks on with trepidation of several years of high school when he starts out as a freshman , but i s taking under the wings of two seniors, the beautiful and irrepressible Sam (Emma Watson) and the gay wit Patrick (Ezra Miller) and becomes part of their crowd after some witty repoirtee at a party after he ate a cannibis laced brownie.<br />Soon he discovers the joys and heartache of teenage life, while struggling with the suicide of his best friend and the ghosts of his past.<br />All the actors are amazing, with of course Emma Watson shining as the free spirited Sam.<br />I came away definitely with something from this movie , basically that everyone deserves, through the moments of struggle and pain, to feel alive, and to really reach a stage where one lives life.<br />Great 80's music and feel. Set in 1991 as one can see from the lack of cellular phones and computers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun  the powers are better, the graphics are better, and the gameplay is the best of it all
B000W796OM|5.0|I gave it a 5 start rating because I love the movie and liked how it was delivered fast and was in good shape.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great show, just as good as the first 4 seasons, hope they make another season.<br />good to watch all at once.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've ever played. I can't stop playing it, it's so addictive! One thing though... I believe that coins should be more common. As I said, one of the best. THANK YOU DEFIANT!!!!!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton's The Secret Keeper is gripping but idulgently long. Morton knows how to spin a story and build that sense of dark, Gothic mystery that is a little creepy and a little romantic. Her characters are sharply drawn. The plot is keenly crafted and even though I wanted this to move faster, I kept reading. She had me hooked. The comparisons to Du Maurier are not unwarranted but I would have enjoyed this more if she would have kept it tighter. Bottom line: Good read just a bit windy.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing this on my kindle fire. I have managed to get a few bingos in reserve so I don't run out, but I usually have to uninstall and reinstall once a day to be able to send or receive gifts.  The same issue when I try to play the tournament! Over all I enjoy the game. I give it four stars.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I first started watching because I love the Kathy Reichs books, and I stayed because it is a fun confection - I mean who doesn't love Angela's father played by  Billy Gibbons  of ZZ Top fame.<br /><br />I enjoy the mysteries but mostly I enjoy the friendships involved.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simply amazing! buttons are big...no squinting needed. easy to use. It comes in handy when I am food shopping. You will not be disappointed one bit.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I'VE READ ALL OF THE BOOKS AND OWN ALL OF THE MOVIES EXCEPT FOR BD PT2 WHICH I WILL OWN ON MARCH 2ND. I WILL ALSO GET THIS DVD AS WELL B/C I LOVE TWILIGHT AND ROBSTEN JUST THAT MUCH!!!!
B0070UFMOW|3.0|It's just ok, there are some things I like about it, it does what it's supposed to, it's easy to use, sound quality is nice etc - but I'm very disappointed about the power-supply/battery. Even if you connect it to a usb-port, it won't turn on until the battery is (somewhat) charged. If the battery is empty you won't be able to turn it on and run it on usb-power. Should the battery ever die it will turn into an expensive paperweight. Another thing I noticed is that it loses its charge very quickly. Leave it unplugged and turned off for a day or two and the battery is empty enough again that you have to charge and wait again until you are allowed to turn it on. This becomes very annoying after a while. I don't know if I just received a broken unit, but from what I found on the web it seems to be the nature of the battery used in these amplifiers. I don't think it will be usable for very long..
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I'm now re-reading East of Eden. This book is just incredible, I'm amazed at how enthralling Steinbeck's writing is, and I'm glad I read it years ago so that now I can experience it as an older man.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app it feels like real life most of the time and I love how you can train up and then go to competition
0143034901|4.0|Loved this book<br /><br />It was like lazily floating along a calm river in a small boat with a soft breeze blowing<br /><br />The writing style is gentle and compelling at the same time. I liked the main character and his behavior was so authentically believable.<br /><br />The story weaves in and out of characters with style and purpose. It is funny... I began to think about a third of the way through the book that maybe it was a little too meandering, then Carlos began to draw the storyline threads together in such a masterful way, I couldn't put the book down until the conclusion.<br /><br />Very beautiful and just ordered another of his stories
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is the best tempel run but it likes to crash then not turn on had no problem downloding but the crashing is so anoing
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like to play this game. It shows you who is getting bingo's and I am always trying to get the high spot!. This game play flawlessly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is challenging for everyone. I like that it updates and lets you play in different settings, nice change of pace..download you won't be disappointed ...
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Seems like people either love or hate this movie.  I don't think you even need to have seen the other alien movies to appreciate this movie.  Many people slam Prometheus because the characters make bad decisions but I don't think it really detracts from the experience.  It's a thriller...there are always fodder type characters brought along on every mission, and usually within the first few minutes you know who they are.<br /><br />I generally enjoy sci-fi movies and can really appreciate when people use some imagination, develop a story, and then deliver it in an intriguing way. Prometheus does just that and more!<br /><br />So again, don't let the cranky part-time internet critics scare you away if you evenly slightly enjoy sci-fi movies, just ignore them and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome way better than temple run u can play with friends on fb is an awesome game plz get
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Informative.  Revealing, right to the point.  Made me feel that I was with them, and proud of our SEALS.  God be with them and their families.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|It wasn't a great flying game. plans wasn't very responsive. Story wasn't clear don't waste your time. that is about it .
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am curious about Mr Grey's past now.  Want to keep reading.  I could do without the ignorant girl though.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|It provides a wide array of news in an incredibly artistic format.  The have stunning photograph and good links. You can't go wrong with this app.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|If tiles were a little bigger it would be a five star game. I still enjoy it but must have glasses on
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many apps are good for the bible but this has the best navigation ability I have seen. Many bible version available. Love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is really awesome I am rating it a five it is so cool I really enjoy playing it
0563214546|5.0|Whereas I would recommend the Ballymaloe Complete Cookery Course as the perfect gift for the more experienced cook, Delia's Complete Cookery Course is really the perfect housewarming gift for the newbie cook - it wold be a lovely wedding gift for example. I got mine from my beloved aunt, and I know I will have it, and refer to it, as long as I have a kitchen to cook in. It teaches all the basics, and whereas some of the recipes (and ingredients) even in this edition are definitly dated, the basics are still solid. Having this book on your stand is almost like having your Mum standing beside you, guiding your hand with her experience.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I so enjoyed the first of the Clifton Chronicles that I couldn't wait to finish the second before pre-ordering the third.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Ordered this as a gift for someone and they received it right on time.<br />:) Oh, They also love it.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Could play this game all day. Unfortunately I need to be working. I use this game to destress after a long work day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game espaicially when I update it has cool themes. Right now I'm on the Rio theme lovee it
B005K17RU0|5.0|We check this site several times a day,especially with the weather we have been experiencing this winter.  My husband loves this app.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game its addiciting and the little animals are so cute and its awesome to let time pass bye I e been playing it for hours and I thought it was only five minutes
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I think the graphics are lousy and they should have a newer version<br />of that game.What I like about that game is that you can change<br />the difficulty level.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|My mother and I love this. I bought this for my mom because she had the original jewel case version but somehow it's missing. I was quiet about this and never told her I was getting this when I saw it came with a DVD I knew for sure I was getting it. Anyway I have it to her and she was so happy! 5 Stars!!
1588167461|5.0|An excellent experience, I can enjoy the oversea shopping online. The book is value for money, which I cannot find it in HK
B003IPC5SO|3.0|I was sent this album twice both came opened. No close seal which I was disappointed. Other than that great album.
B0091LS07E|4.0|It's a good album.  I don't feel like it is an excellent album<br />I don't have seven more words to write.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game I didn't think id like it but I was wrong. was not blethering than mincraft or any thing like that
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of those books that you can't put down once you begin reading. I loved that the storyline was a bit unpredictable and that there were twists and turns throughout the novel. I am looking forward to reading more by this author!
0307591549|5.0|I went to a seminar called &#34;Serious Business&#34; and saw this guy in action. He is simply amazing. His books sold out before I got a chance to purchase it. So happy I found it here on Amazon...and at a cheaper price too. This book covers everything he said at the seminar. The book is great but doesn't compare to listening to him live on stage.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book was quite technical in many parts. Basically, it is about an astronaut that ends up being stranded on Mars in the very early days of Martian exploration. The story tells what he did to manage to live from day to day. I have some technical knowledge but nowhere near what is necessary to determine how feasible the actions he took were. It would have been tedious reading if it wasn't for the chapters dealing with what was going on at NASA and the ship he was on initially. The ending seemed a little rushed. It was something different and a good read. I'd recommend it but would understand how some would not want to plow through all the technical things involving electronics, physics, and biology that he had to do.
B0031RS7EK|4.0|A little over the top at times, never the less a very good read. Nick Stone does not let his immage slip as a tough character with all the witty remarks. Another good read from a top Author
B00AREIAI8|2.0|the first time I played i liked it but<br />then it took forever to load next time i<br />tried to play.....
B0001HLVS2|1.0|When I put the DVD into my lap top to play it yesterday, it wouldn't play! All my computer was doing was trying to load it, thinking, making noise. I thought then that it was my lap top so I removed the DVD and tried another movie, which worked perfectly. I was very excited to get this movie and very disappointed at this outcome. :/
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played and it is free you must get this game I haven't stopped playing it please download it is amazing. :)
B008IZYW3U|5.0|Wonderful! The remastered version with the full orchestra is superb. If you are a fan of Freddy or a secret Opera Buff you will love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  I recommended it to my mom and step-daughter as soon as I finished it.  I couldn't wait for them to read it so we could talk about it.  The subject matter was a bit intense especially toward the end of the book so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 16-17 unless they are more mature for their age.
0765325950|5.0|Like many others ive waited a long time for this book. It was simply amazing. Sanderson did a beautiful job finishing the series.
B0058YPGVQ|1.0|We were halfway through watching disk two of Season Four when it froze. Repeated attempts to get the disk to play were unsuccessful. The dvd screen kept saying to \\"check disk.\\" We ended up downloading Sons of Anarchy from Netflix and watching the rest of Season Four on Netflix.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awsomethis game is good for kids and I absolutely. Love itawsome game awesome hi hi
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I don't usually go for these games. I bought it for my granddaughter to play. But I found it addictive and somewhat relaxing.
B00000AF95|5.0|The CD arrived on time & in great condition - no small feat considering the number of CDs I've received with broken cases.  I always love their music, so have been enjoying the CD.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Its terrible. I keep on getting it then play it once then it crashes then I delete and buy it again. For some reason it wont stop crashing.
B008SVFX96|5.0|The CD arrived early & in great condition.  Richie has once again created great music & I only wish he wasn't recording & touring so much with Bon Jovi that he doesn't have more time to concentrate on his solo career.  He should definitely be singing more than once song in the BJ concerts & should record some of the songs on the CDs.  He has an amazing voice!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|More great work from one of today's best cross-over artists.  Another year of life experiences set to music.  You will really enjoy this one.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The Author does not keep it interesting I don't feel I am involved in the story  life of pi may be a good movie
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is just what I wanted from this set. All three movies, special features and booklet. I got a great deal with the pre-order as well.
1939416019|2.0|In general the book was a quick read but the plot was simplistic and predictable. I wish someone would have proof read the book. Too many misspellings and conext errors.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very addicting! Once I start playing I can't stop; leveling up my horse and making it look cooler is a neat aspect in this game!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|This weather app is one of the best for Kindle Fire HD. I use it daily to check the weather (obviously), but the only feature it seems to lack is a good IR satellite image. The radar is there and works great, but checking cloud cover at night is what I want/need the most since I am an amateur astronomer and like to know the type of cloud cover at night. I have the satellite option checked but it can be overcast and I still see no clouds on the map unless it's radar images<br /><br />Get a good day and night satellite imagery and I will bump this up from four stars to five.<br /><br />Love all the features and the layout for this app, and as I said it's one of the best minus this one feature it seems to lack. I don't want to have another weather app just for this one thing.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|One it free....... two  videos to show each exercise...... three  the count down for each section<br />It's a good starting point for me to get back in the habit of working out.<br />short sweet to the point
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun when you have some downtime and don't want to have to think too hard. Simple and addictive.<br />Love it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very addicting game for ages 3 and up. It was funny when my son first tried it, he sent the birds backwards, now, he is good at the challenges and plays to other levels. I was hesitant about the game and was glad I finally checked it out and discovered how much fun it is. I even got other older family members hooked! Love the abilities of the birds and what they could do, which I didn't know until a family member told me how they worked. I also LOVE the various screens to play and so does my son.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this in a day.  I loved the character development.  Such a good movie!  I recommend it to anyone.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a good game and it was fun to show my son how to play. Everything is the same when I used to play it, except with technology its now on a kindle. He is a little young for the game to fully get the challenge, but he keeps trying. It is a great game for little ones and definitely takes me back to my childhood. LOL
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great new course in this second edition to temple run. I loved the first game so much but it was repetitive in the course. The nee graphics and trails are awesome
B00B780TAK|5.0|Every episode has a new twist. And just when I think I have everyone and everything figured out,a road is taken I didn't see coming. I can't wait for Season 4!
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle was killed on Saturday, 2/4/13 at a rifle range along with one over person by an former Marine who allegedly is a victim of PTSD...I will buy the book by Mr Chris Kyle for his family will need all the financial help available....sad unfortunate ending to a good fellow veteran.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like Hunter, Flynn has the knack for keeping one turning the pages. As with Hunter, I have read every one of Flynn's book. Always fantastic, always a page turner and always satisfying. I hate for them to end.
B00AY9RV90|5.0|I'm surprised a lot of these songs never made it to the Waiting for the Sirens song, which is a great album in it own right.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I'm not one to reveiw books or movies but The Windtalkers I thought was just an incredible movie. I always like to read military nonfiction and watch war movies, and this one is that but it's got a great message to it. Like any good book, it requires you to think a little bit about how the characters feel and stuff, to understand the plot something a lot of movies these days wont do. When you start to actually care about the characters, that's a big part of what makes this movie great. This movies also got a lot of good action in it as well, a little gruesome, but not to bad.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />&#34;There are two kinds of serial killers as far as the victim is concerned: the kind that you don't see before they pounce on you and the kind you see and don't expect to pounce on you.&#34;<br /><br />- Pat Brown -<br /><br />The story is about a crime journalist, Camille. She travels back to her home town to write an article about the murders of two girls.<br />It's a small town, population 2000. Most of people there have know each other since childhood and no one believes that the killer could be one of the locals.<br />Cute little town, full of high school sweethearts with their cute little families, houses with the white picket fences and 2,5 kids. Streets are full of cute little boys and girls running around.<br /><br />Cute, right? Well, as you read you discover that behind the close doors, of those cute houses, lives some very disturbing people. The more you read the more it looks like it was a job of a local. Pretty much everyone starts looking suspicious. You reach the point in the story where almost everyone looks, sounds and acts like a serial killer :).<br /><br />Some very dark and disturbing secrets start coming out and at this point you think that anyone of them could have done it. There is a lot of speculation going on, who could have done it and most importantly why? Who could be so evil to hurt a child.<br /><br />Flynn is brilliant at playing games with readers minds. She creates characters that are very hard to like and even harder to figure it out. It's almost impossible to figure it out who the killer is. I have changed my theory on who that might be, maybe a dozen times. Just when you think you know who did it, something happens and you start doubting. It's very fun to read (aside from the fact that kids are being murdered, of course).<br /><br />I would have given it a 5 starts if it wasn't for the ending. It's fine the way it ended, but I felt like the ending was a bit rushed. It almost felt like &#34;Oh, by the way...&#34;. I think that epilogue was completely unnecessary. I would have loved for the story to have ended with:<br /><br />- WARNING SPOILERS -<br /><br />... Disappearance of Lily Burke.<br /><br />- END OF SPOILERS -<br /><br />Readers would still have known who did it and maybe why, plus, it would have left readers surprised and in shock, with bunch of questions &#34;How? When? Why?&#34;. How and when is not important, and as to why, the story had enough information about the murders and characters, for the reader to figure it out.<br />Other than that, it was a brilliantly written story, total page turner...&#34;. I think that epilogue was completely unnecessary. I would have loved for the story to have ended with:<br /><br />- WARNING SPOILERS -<br /><br />... Disappearance of Lily Burke.<br /><br />- END OF SPOILERS -<br /><br />Readers would still have known who did it and maybe why, plus, it would have left readers surprised and in shock, with bunch of questions &#34;How? When? Why?&#34;. How and when is not important, and as to why, the story had enough information about the murders and characters, for the reader to figure it out.<br />Other than that, it was a brilliantly written story, total page turner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game because I have always wanted a horse and this game gives me that wonderful experience. I would reccomnd this game to all u horse lover's!!!!
B002J2WGLI|5.0|Such a great movie and a classic already! Love this movie eveeything about it. All the little thing that a typical Quentin tarentino movie is.
0062009540|5.0|Book arrived in time stated and condition was excellent like always. Never a problem. I think my husband would love to see me not get on but no way.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game that let's you play with your own virtual horses. The only bad thing is that your energy meter runs out really fast so you have to wait or buy an energy treat for your horse. But it is a great game on my kindle fire.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|A great book for us - the geeks of the 80s. great references for good 70s-80s music and vintage video games.<br />Knowledge of these games is not mandatory but the book is much more fun when it brings up good memories.<br />All in all - the tension is kept all through the book all the way to the great finish.<br />Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Let me start by saying I have a tendency to start reading a book and if the first 15-20 pages don't interest me I will put it down and maybe come back to it later. With this book there was no later, from the time I picked it up I was hooked. The story is engaging and you can't help but to get pulled into the charecters lives and start rooting for them.  For three days this book occupied all of my free time and I must say im glad it did.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I was a little skeptical about the quality of DVD (priced very low), but was very happy upon arrival. The DVD played great and it arrived so quick! Will definitely purchase from this buyer again.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|ive noteced when you run into mystery boxes and you open it it sometimes takes coins and I keep trake of my coins when I come back and play there are some missing sometimes as I'm playing I keep track and notice I have less than when I began please fix the coin steeling problem
B00A3XWB10|1.0|Generation wild was one of my favorite CDs, and I actually donated money for crashdiet to help with production costs of this cd but wow, this has to be one of the worst sounding albums I have ever heard.  I wish this isn't the case but its horrendous.  I can't even listen to it.  I have seen this band live and they rock, but something definitely changed on this cd.... Stay the hell away from this ...
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I purchased this as a present for a family member.  I had to wait for the price to come down to make it worth while.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is very fun and addictive when you start playing:) it makes you feel like you have your own horse!!!
B003L20ICE|1.0|Very disappointing! I love Mark Ruffalo in movies, but this combo didn't work and the way the movie ended up going wasn't necessary!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Love it!  This movie is hilarious...we watched it over and over again and will definitely rent again!  I love the lessons learned for all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Knowing the weather conditions ahead, not only saves time, but also does not require a sophisticated news, and weather forecast broadcasting station. Making this app portable, dependable, resourceful, and time preserving.
B009YAIZUE|5.0|I read a lot of &#34;mindful&#34; books and this one is a good one. Take the time, read it and help yourself to become a better person.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Wasn't terribly impressed with this book, either didn't fulfill my expectations based on the book review.  Disappointed, but nevertheless, doubtful I'll purchase anothe rby this author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Choirs of angels.  Actual goosebumps.  This is television so worth waiting for that when it finally comes, you can't breathe, until it comes time to cheer or yell at the characters.  Downton Abbey is riveting and matchless, and the third season is just as strong as the first two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a good game to play in your free time. I will recommend it. Awesomely good. Rate rate rate
B001JQVKBW|5.0|I love the way Seal re did the oldies. Didn't realize until recently what a great voice and job he did with the oldies. Would recommend this album to anyone.
B009PODB76|5.0|Great cd, Wish we heard more and seen more of her here in the USA,I was very happy with it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was the author's first African American character very, very good. Waiting for sequel. I read in a few daya.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great Cd, All I can say is I  feel  Kelly is getting better  than she started. Not that she wasn't always talented, I enjoy her music more now than ever and this Cd  has her best
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Haven't been real scared in a long time.  This is worth it.  I am a little disturbed with the Nazi reference.  Been watching Hitler documentaries prior to this so it did upset me, but that is how AHS is written.  Still scary. Interesting characters.
030758836X|5.0|Wow!  What can I say that hasn't been said already!  Quite possibly one of the most intriguing mystery/thriller/suspense books I have ever read!  I just didn't see \\"that\\" coming was what I said over and over in this great read.  One of the few books I have ever read that I wanted to pick it up and read it again right after I finished to see all of the clues I missed the first time around.  Bravo!
B000BF0D9M|4.0|Very pleased with this purchase; love acoustic guitar.  If you are a fan of Ottmar Liebert, you will enjoy this artist as well.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love how the game allows for your bank to increase even though you're not physically playing it. the instructions were clear and simple with no issues. I enjoy playing these games. it challenges your city management skills and time management.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I would say this movie was childish but then again children cant see a movie with a bear dropping the f-bomb and snorting lines of coke.  The simplicity of the humor makes &#34;Half baked&#34; look like a Moonlight Sonata by comparison and really there was no plot what so ever.  If you think a teddy bear smoking a joint can ntertain you for an hour and a half....this movie id for you.
B0086700CM|4.0|A fun and challenging game for all ages. Me, I ran right off the edge and was done. My granddaughter had loads of fun with it and is a bit faster with the reflexes than I.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|It's OK. I wouldn't go nuts over it. If  you choose to read a book up-right you really can't use the stand. When you use the stand you are restricted as to how many lines you read.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|A challenging game for the Kindle Fire. You really need to pay attention to this one or as the title suggests, you will go over the &#34;EDGE&#34;
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I've always loved toca apps. They are even entertaining for adults! So much to do, a ton of graphics and detail. Well, well worth the money!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Does this game &#34;really&#34; need a rating? The game is and has always been an exciting and fun game. There is only one thing that could possibly make Angry Birds better and that is to play life size(we've done that too).
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Worth the money graphics are awesome and spooky. I love it.  Finished it quickly though wished it was  much . longer<br />Pretty dark. Stuff
B008AK8FHM|1.0|There was too much medical jargon throughout this whole book. There was not enough details about the actual experience of heaven. This book is more suited to someone in the medical or science profession.
B00846REIS|5.0|You'll fall in love with these characters!!! Cannot wait to read the next one. I need to see what Eva & Gideon will they do.....next!!!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|its really good, but I think Theather of the Absurd was better. this is really cool, don't get me wrong. I love this company.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love how easy it is to set the clock up and all the options you have..  tonight will be my first night trying so we will see. Would have liked to seen more cute or melodic choices to pick from without having to load my own.
B009C7JS14|3.0|It was a cute app but I wasn't as happy with it for my needs but others should enjoy it.  It was easy to set-up and get around in.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Great new album.great band to see live also.<br />Thrash metal lives on in testaments latest effort. The entire album is verry solid.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My first read on my new kindle couldn't have been better.  I picked it because so many gave it five stars and because there wasn't profanity.  The characters were so real.  I loved Hazel's dad.  Couldn't wait to get home each night so I could read it. Highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|More fun than the first Temple Run, but the save now button will often cause the app to crash and score/coins won't save.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it has good graphics and I really enjoy it. I would recommend this game to any horse lover's.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is the best game ever but I think it could use like armour so you don't always die when a zombie or skeleton or spider guts what I think they should add to this game
0062206281|4.0|As I have mentioned before this is my favorite author but this is not one of his better works. I was so disappointed.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|This was for a friend, and I never heard back from here if she read it, liked it or not.
1594200106|5.0|When you read this book you get so lost into Barcelona that you feel like you are walking the streets and have the senses of everything going around you. So delicious.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This surpassed my expectations. I'm a bit of a butterfingers and am forever dropping my phone. I've cracked a few plastic phone cases but when I saw this I thought this could be my phone's &#34; life jacket&#34;. It's great.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is the cooler you are looking for! OCed core I7 to 4.2 Ghz idle: 37C burn test: 50C. Can't do better than that without water cooled heat sync. I added another fan to the opposite side.<br />Best one on the market for the price!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|Generic, boring, and just bulls***. I'm the type of person that likes to look through reviews and see what if wrong with whatever I mite be interest in buying. I also take people I know mainly my friends opinion to perspective as well. Now I'm in my early 20s, haven't been a virgin since a young age (15-17) like a lot of women and I frankly can not relate to this bulls***. From what it seems the author is trying to milk the Twighlight fame into her book. As you read the book you'll notice how she describes her characters and scenarios are similar to the movie which was bulls*** even when I was at an age where you'd think I should of been a Twighheart like the rest of my friends (and they still are). I should of considered the reviews on amazon than my friends in lala world that said this book was badly written and thats the sad truth. I have heard that the 2nd and 3rd one would be better than the unrealistic first book, but i can't even get of chapter 10 without either rolling my eyes or doing something more productive like sleeping. If you like actual good book and don't believe in badly written unrealistic love that is told in a lot of romance novels then I suggest not buying maybe borrowing the book if you need some new tricks in your sex life. I know there's a lot people who like this book kiddos to them for looking pass reality to believe something that is highly unlikely (makes me want to cough something up thinking about it) and enjoying horrible descriptions.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This app is a very useful fraction calculator, certainly. There is nothing wrong with what it offers, but rather the fact there is no decimal conversion option. Overall though, as long as you can remember every decimal conversion, than there is no issue. Hopefully, the developer will put in this option soon.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Still working after lots of rain and freezing weather. Fix time is a quick 1-3 seconds,after the initial fix which took a few minutes. Reported position appears quite accurate, although I don't know if that's because my software is snapping to the road and direction of travel. I suppose I'll know more when I head off-road.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not what I expected.  I couldn't put it down.  A little smut and a little suspense, I loved it!!  Super easy read.
B008S847X2|5.0|It was a gift and they really love it! This was definitely worth the money; I highly recommend this latest CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Leaves you a bit changed - more reflected and thankful. Recommend it to everyone from 14 and up, who have read a bit and are looking for something to think about.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|WOW! This is the best animated movie I have seen since Mask of the Phantasm. It is also probably the most faithful adaptation of the comic you will ever see. Heart pounding, goose bump inducing, edge of your seat fun. This is one I will watch again and again, it is truly satisfying. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|Can't stop listening to it. Love the original album facsimiles, and for a music nerd like me, the fact the CDs are numbered in chronological order is heavenly. All the original liner notes are here as well. Would only say a longer retrospective essay to put these recordings in historical perspective would be welcome. Well worth every cent.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Phthysic went ABOVE and Beyond to make sure I got the order I did from him.  I'm VERY happy and HIGHLY recommend him.
1469220660|5.0|I love this book. I feel like I know the characters and it is well written. I prefer this book/series over the 50 shades because the characters both have more troubled backgrounds.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone that would like get an insight into the life a military members at the top of his profession.  There a few things left out of his story, but for obvious reasons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and all my cousins and friends and family love it and subway surfers keeps all the little ones busy during babysitting
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I purchased this movie because the substance as being a father and how it impacts their children's. The quality and level of how it was created have it moments of being low budget in my opinion. Nonetheless, the story line and theme over shadow's that making it a hit for my family. I would recommend this to a family member or friend.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie was awesome. I love it. Had me cracking up the whole time! I would purchase it for a few of my friends when I have the extra money!
B0085776BG|5.0|I purchased this as a gifts for the men in my family. I couldn't resist of taking a peek before giving them away. Boy, the sound, the special effects and the way it all came together was a real treat. Also, all of the actors did a excellent performance playing their rolls. In my opinion, this is a must film and I'd recommend to friends.
B0025VLEM0|3.0|Hot Fuzz and Paul are both funnier movies. I'd definitely recommend purchasing or watching them before watching Shaun of the Dead.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is more than just a zombie series. It is full of action and drama. I look forward to watching it every week!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game in the world so cool unlock a whole bunch of people really cool.Really Cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good and very addicting but it would be nice if things weren't as expensive and hard to get.<br />I like how you can compete against friends too.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The beginning boards are so easy I was thinking of deleting but it does progress to harder boards.  Be aware that you can purchase more boards and get rid of the ads or just enjoy what they give you for free.
B0054X3FQO|4.0|I loved the inspirational quotes and word choice. We all know Miranda isn't a writer, but she is an amazing woman who has been through so much. She is beautiful and kind and I feel we should all choose to follow in her footsteps as a kind, successful person.<br /><br />Thank you, Miranda for sharing your love with me.<br /><br />I loved this book! I just wish it was longer.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is an excellent unembellished rendering of the ugly underside of a world at war. It is graphic in outlining the political and social considerations that informed this global conflict.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like the game, but I wish that they would lower the upgrade prices.and it has has lots of fun packed in it, and they have a theme, every once and a while they change it, right now, it is *RIO* I hope you enjoy it, I do.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This was an excellent thriller in a realistic historical context. Even the villain was given a human face. Tho thumbs up.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to take care of your own horse and train them for different championships the only thing I don't like is waiting for your energy to refill
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I loved it, the difference from a blue ray and regular dvd is remarkable. It came in on time, just like the date said. This is why I love ordering from this site.
078322608X|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it as a child. Now that I'm an adult i love it even more! I am very happy to finally own it. :)
1401235417|5.0|Amazing start to Batman.  The storyline, artwork, and overall feel was incredible.  Highly recommend to both old and new readers.
0062218867|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was afraid it was going to be as badly out of Terry Pratchett's style as Unseen Academicals, which I suspect was ghost-written.  But either Terry Pratchett worked harder to overcome his health problems on this one, or his ghost-writer tried harder to sound like Terry Pratchett, because this book was, for the most part, pleasurably a genuine Terry Pratchett book.  It is of the Angry Sam Vimes genre, so don't expect a light-hearted romp.  That is not to say that there is no humor in the book, just that the humor is of the more grim variety.  Many references to past events are featured in the book, which may make it a little less readable for readers who are new to the series.  My advice to those readers is to start the series at the beginning and read through to this book, and things will be more clear.  Not only that, but you will have hours and hours and hours of enjoyable reading getting to that point.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is one of my very favorite British crime dramas. Benedict Cumberbatch is fabulous. I just wish a season was more than 4 episodes.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|THIS BOOK IS REMINISCENT OF \\"THE GARDEN OF THE BEASTS,\\" BUT WITH AN EXPANDED PLOT AND CAST. FOLLETTE IS A MASTER IN THIS GENRE AND SCORES BIG.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wasn't sure how I would like this show but it has become one of my favorite. I look forward to the witty commentary each week.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Kearns Goodwin does a fine job giving us insight into the cabinet that Lincoln not only assembled but held together. For a reader who has consumed many good histories of the Civil War, much of &#34;action&#34; of the war seems to be left out, but in its place is an interesting and well told tale of big egos grinding away on each other, serving a cause that might well have foundered had this crew not produced for a leader they all initially undervalued.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I think the game itself is fun and a thinker and is fun to play I hope that it remains a thing that amazon will continue to offer.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Video came before the day it was supposed to arrive. The blu-ray qaulity was great, and it really pleased me to see this fabulous film once again. Reminds me of the time I spend on the island every year.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pop music surrounded by enough plot to pull it together. The characters are interesting (if off the wall) and the vocals are stellar.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really great show, great quality video. I was really impressed with the high qaulity of the film. It looked amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever can't stop playing it addictive and love the world tour got Tony and Carmen already awesome and cool
B00005JKZV|5.0|Movie came in when I expected it, it was my error in purchasing 2 of the same movie, had meant to purchase The fellowship of the Ring  also, no problem.
034580404X|5.0|Very spell binding a real page turner and even my husband is reading it! Actually will be looking for other books by E.L. James!
B009LZDGSI|5.0|Ok the blockbuster one with what's his name where homes is an adict and kicks ass?! this is more real and believable<br /><br />Miss Lu is a knockout, I want more Lucy.<br /><br />The characters are great and the show will keep you on the edge of your seat<br /><br />Can't wait for next season!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app, and I think anybody that loves horses will too!  This is the best virtual horse game on the kindle!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|They did it again.  Fantastic new season! I recommend Supernatural to any and all fans of SciFi, Fantasy, Horror or good old family relationships!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this show.  While I love the movies based on comics, the TV shows haven't done so well.  This one excels because of the character development.  Who knew?  Character development in a comic?!?  Arrow is a conflicted human being who is trying very hard to work out his issues.  He doesn't always get it right and he pays a high price from time to time.  A hero who fails, see what I mean about character development?  The supporting characters are well rounded also and over time the viewer begins to feel that they know and either like or dislike these people.  The action is also good and the plot lines are interesting.  Although it is a show with violence in it; it does not contain the horrible graphic violence a lot of shows today do.  I'd recommend it.
1608871452|5.0|Beautiful book, lots of details and shinys inside!  I love the 3D nature of it; it adds a whole new dimension to exploring the Winchesters' lives.  I especially like how it is directed at the more devoted of the fan-base -- this is no 'guide to the show', like most shows have; this is an indepth, hands-on, personal scrapbook of the show for its fans.  Really really nice!
B0034G4OYA|2.0|The movie itself is great, but this purchase option with UltraViolet Digital Copy was disappointing.  I didn't understand the difference between a regular Digital Copy and UltraViolet Digital Copy.  You can't download to iTunes so it was a waste to pay the extra money, as the copy is not truly mobile -- you need internet connection to watch UltraViolet copy since its stored in a cloud.
034580404X|4.0|First book GREAT, wants you reading more......second book good.....third book that's enough. By the third book this got old. Rich guy with body guards = people can still get passed them.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is so much better than the American version &#34;Elementary.&#34; If you have to pick one to watch, definitely pick this one
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have this app on all of my devices and use it a lot for wasting time. its pretty cool and fun.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I love movies that my kids and I can enjoy together.  They tend to fall into a groove where they want to watch the same movie over and over and OVER.  That can get pretty old quickly with some of their choices.  I've now seen Hotel Transylvania five times (yeah, I know) and honestly I'm still enjoying it.  There are plenty of cute moments and catchy songs, and the main conflict is something that any parent can empathize with - a child growing up and wanting to set off on their own adventures.  In this movie, however, the child is turning 118 and her father is Count Dracula.  Just when the Count succeeds in convincing his daughter that the outside world is dangerous and she should remain in his castle/hotel for monsters indefinitely, a 21-year old backpacker stumbles upon the hotel and turns their world upside down.  It has a great ending, and I must say even after five viewings I'm still cracking up in places.  I'd definitely recommend it!
B008220BLG|4.0|Attached to this film is a trailer for \\"World War Z\\", an adaptation of Max Brooks' excellent novel which looks to be a shoe-in for one of the year's worst films. Packed with overabundant CGI, a contrived plot, and seeming to be lacking in the depth that made the source material so great, it's pretty indicative of the current state of zombie films as a whole. What a relief it is, then, that \\"Warm Bodies\\" is one of the most charming and original takes on the sub-genre I've seen in a while, and something I would heartily recommend to anybody with an open mind.<br /><br />The plot, based on a novel by the same name, takes place from the perspective of \\"R\\", a young, attractive zombie with a witty inner monologue and desire to be more human. Enter Julia, a girl whom he lays eyes on after killing her boyfriend. He takes her back to his home (a refashioned airplane that looks like a hipster heaven), and slowly begins to become more human as his heart begins to beat again. Soon, this begins to spread like a virus among the zombie populace (ironic, I know), and they begin to regain consciousness. However, the humans still won't forgive and forget, and the real threat to both the zombies and humans, terrifying skeletal creatures called \\"Bonies\\", begin to pose serious problems. Will the seemingly doomed romance last?<br /><br />You'll be asking yourself that question throughout, which is what makes this film such a winner. Nothing is ever really certain, as it is an experience that is all at once refreshing and unpredictable. At any given moment, something seems as if it's going to go wrong with \\"R\\" and Julia, and you're left biting your nails in suspense not from horror, but from the desire to see the relationship work. This relationship is the beating heart of the film, and honestly, this is what makes it such an enjoyable watch.<br /><br />That said, it might not be for everybody. Much like many cult films (think \\"They Live\\"), \\"Warm Bodies\\" can slow to a crawl just as much as it can speed up to a fever pitch. While some people, like myself, may appreciate the interactions between a human and a zombie, and the unique dilemmas brought about by those, others may find these to be slow and tedious. This is understandable, and I can't fault people for that. This isn't as peppy and constantly funny as the trailers may lead you to believe; its tone is more one of ambiguity, and for some, that may be too demanding.<br /><br />What everybody should appreciate about this quirky little piece, though, is the excellent acting on all fronts. Nicholas Houlten as the lead is a delight, his ability to balance out his inner monologue with convincingly \\"dead trying to be alive\\" acting proving to be a winning combo. Teresa Palmer plays an equally as convincing love interest, acting pretty much exactly how somebody falling in love with the living dead would act. Special props should be given to Analeigh Tipton, who plays a charmingly ditsy best friend to Julie, and John Malkovich (what is HE doing here?!) as Julie's literally militaristic anti-zombie father. The acting drives the film, really, and if one actor was replaced, it just wouldn't be as good.<br /><br />Tied to together with some neat cinematography, which is clever enough to ignore the lacking special effects, and a lovably atypical soundtrack, \\"Warm Bodies\\" is destined to be one of this generation's cult classics. Not for everybody, sure, but those who like it will adore it, and it may likely become one of their favorite films, and one of their favorite cinematic romances.<br /><br />Now, how did their hearts start beating again anyhow...?<br /><br />Overall: Bs it can speed up to a fever pitch. While some people, like myself, may appreciate the interactions between a human and a zombie, and the unique dilemmas brought about by those, others may find these to be slow and tedious. This is understandable, and I can't fault people for that.

Not for everybody, sure, but those who like it will adore it, and it may likely become one of their favorite films, and one of their favorite cinematic romances.<br /><br />Now, how did their hearts start beating again anyhow...?<br /><br />Overall: B
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The dialogue between the protagonists is good - but there is too much of it. The story does not move; it is stuck in dialogue. Obviously written from a woman's point of view and picturization. When the boy gets into bed with her and she asks him to kiss her and he doesn't...that's way out man! Maybe lesbians could do that - I don&#34;t know, but a girl and a boy??? I thought it was so unatural that I gave up reading after that.<br /><br />Jeff Tikari
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|It sounds so real that its presence is incredible. You can't get that vinyl sound, but really who cares with the clear sound, that bass, the piano.  I could feel the instruments beside me.  WOOW!!!!<br />K2 processing is out of this world, much better thn ultra high definition, by the way makes me sick.
0981951252|3.0|The quality of the audio book is great. Easy to listen to and a well done recording. As for the content, Darren often quotes Jim Rohn or Brian Tracy. One of the key differences for me is that Jim Rohn often talks about how his success is more than just learning how to improve and do things others won't do. It is also about how God has made us and how understanding how God has made us allows us to be successful. In a self-improvement book, that shows up in the depth of examples and how those examples apply to our lives. I didn't hear any of that with this. As a result, I found the examples to be somewhat shallow and redundant and not as applicable to life.  When you take God out, it becomes a Tony Robbins-like message that is positive and hard working but not with depth. I was hoping for more.
B008PWUU3W|4.0|I like it for a couple reasons. It is on e that is easy to grab and run with when going somewhere and I like the way the flap folds over secure. I use both covers (not at the same time) and depending on where I take it , each one has it's advantages.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is a great movie.  One of the best acting by Clint Eastwood I've seen in a long time.  I like most of his movies but this one was very moving, emotional and worth remembering.  Great unexpected ending.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love, love playing Mahjong and this allows me to play many, many versions of my favorite game.  And it keeps challenging me.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I loved this it's hard 2 believe it's a true story I plan to read more of Mitch albums books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best knock off game. Even though it is temple run for even younger kids. The power ups need to be changed a little bit though because they are kind of lame.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game because it gave us different scenes of the world. Thank you for making this game so much fun for me and the rest of the family.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I did not receive the book, and got charged twice. I did read other reviews and gathered that the books were<br />rather sophmoric.  Just wish I hadn't even tried to order them.  BTW the review has my husband's name on it, review<br />was done by Nancy Overcash
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is's the best ever that is all i got to say because it is just like temple run 1and 2 just get it right now!To see more about it go on your kindle,ipad, and ipod
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i like how it lets you train your own horse and change our character and present your horse in the wayt that you want
0765348276|4.0|It's been a while since I've read something from the SF genre. When I heard that OLD MAN'S WAR was rated the number one SF book for the 21st century, I just had to give it a try.<br /><br />For the most part, I agree that this is a great SF novel--and it's not so much because of what he writes--as I'll show below much of this is derivative--but *how* he says it.<br /><br />For example, I remember first reading about an earth-to-space elevator in Kim Stanley Robinson's novel RED MARS. John Scalzi just calls it a \\"beanstalk.\\" That one word did more to explain a space-elevator than any amount of technical mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />The first two parts of the novel are comparable to John Steakley's ARMOR, Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS and the drill sergeant scene from the movie FULL METAL JACKET. Why read a book that is just going to rehash something that most SF fans have read before? I'll tell you why: It's rare to see a novel that has religion without being preachy, humor that will make you laugh out loud (the introduction to the BrainPal), sex scenes that actually make sense, and finally, a gay character (Alan) who doesn't try to shove the gay agenda down your throat (pun very much intended).<br /><br />When I watch the movie FULL METAL JACKET, I watch only the first half. Not because the second half is inherently bad or flawed, but because the first half set the bar so high. I believe the same is true for OLD MAN'S WAR. The first two parts are absolutely, let-me-read-that-again brilliant. The second half is certainly worth reading and comes to a nice conclusion, but I wish Scalzi could have maintained his brilliance throughout.<br /><br />One minor disappoint: We are told that the elderly are allowed to recruit because of their vast experience. However, except for a few memories of his wife and his writing career, I didn't feel that John Perry's past contributed much to his success in battle. I would have liked to see more evidence that the long experience-filled livesof these \\"Old F*rts\\" actually made them better soldiers and not just soldiers that reminisce from time-to-time.<br /><br />With that minor aside, I really liked this book. I'd give it a 4.5 if Amazon allowed half-stars.<br />I wouldn't say that this star of a novel outshines STARSHIP TROOPS, ARMOR or the first half of FULL METAL JACKET, but it certainly earns a spot in their constellation.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Ok, so I'm giving this game 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, this game is super fun! I love the graphics and the sky kingdom and the obstacles. I like #2 more than the first one and LOVE the &quot;Save Me&quot; option. Best of all, it's free!! It's just that sometimes when I hit the &quot;Save Me&quot; button it exits me out of the game and it lags sometimes but other than those minor problems, I suggest getting it now :D
0201633612|5.0|I teach OOP and OOD for several semesters now. I knew, ofcourse, about design patterns and the GoF, but somehow never had the chance to read this book. Finally I've decided I have to read it, so I bought it and it blew my mind. Clear, sophisticated and yet so important. It was such a great pleasure to read it, to think about every pattern, to try to understand deeply the solutions - one of the best books I've ever read.<br />My advice for whom it may concern - don't hurry. Lots of the patterns seem identical, and in a brief look you might not get the differences between them. Don't give up - try to understand the solution, try to invent a design problem of your own, it's worthy!
0374533571|3.0|Oddly enough, the movie is much better than the book. I saw the movie first though so maybe the other way around would make the book better...but I doubt it.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|We got 2 of these at an introductory price. Got it almost immediately. I listen to this constantly. Great music!
630587493X|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it always changes first Reguler then new York city then Rio and I like the charicters and the booted and the back round.
B000068TPN|5.0|I have seen the movie and would recommend it. I bought as a gift. They are very pleased with it.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I was very surprised by his talent...I don't keep up with American Idol anymore so didn't watch his season.  I close my eyes and hear a mix of Dave Matthews and Paul Simon.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B0091AJ6PK|5.0|The quality of the artists, songs, and production is so good that this album sounds like it actually came from 1979.  While it isn't as popish as &#34;Squeezin Out Sparks&#34; or as soulful as &#34;Howlin' Wind,&#34; the performance is excellent and it just shows how great all of these guys sound when playing together again... let's hope it continues!
B002ZG997C|5.0|his was recommended by a friend. It needs to be seen at least twice to get the full depth of the movie. Highly recommend.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|This album is subcompact and makes it point and then moves on. The songs are short and the choruses are very catchy, which will make you sing along to it, in your car or even drinking beer with your friends. The first three songs on the album are killers, it will have you fist pumping and jumping around. Their vocals and guitar strumming are out of this world. They did not disappoint on this cd and delivered a solid Hatebreed record. The song 'who got more heart then you' I can see everybody in the club fists pumping, head banging singing Fists Up! Head High! We Own The F.....ing World Tonight.  The best hardcore album out there right now, so if you looking for true rock punk music get this c.d now. I recommend this brilliant c.d to anybody who wants to listen to good music, for this cd rocks.
B0000714BP|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B00AYDC3CG|1.0|The whole movie was in black and white and I thought it was just bizarre for a kids movie.  Too scary for my 5 year old.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the book.it was funny romantic and a little weird but mostly amazing.I think you should read this book.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
1452110581|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for a fellow cat lover. There are a few really great poems and a few that are a little too serious for my taste in that they aren't cutesy or rhyme, as I would expect poems written by cats to be :) Overall, the book is clearly written by a cat owner and lover, and anyone who has a cat will surely appreciate the author's insight into their behavior.
B000065U1N|5.0|I have seen the movie and would recommend it. I bought as a gift. They are very pleased with it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Really cool that they used the same actors from season one. This season dragged a little bit however and was not nearly as suspenseful or compelling
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I have seen the movie and would recommend it. I bought as a gift. They are very pleased with it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show , it ranks with HBO programs. I like watching it with no commercials though , its great to own it like this.
1250004349|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
B0018OFN4U|4.0|We love Zombie movies. This is not quiet as classic as Evil Dead but is very funny and at the same time somewhat scary and suspenseful genre film
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love all of your games... Just wish you could give you're loyal's a break in price. Just chose out ramdomley sp? That would be a good way to give back...<br />I love the way they make you think and remember! And that's coming from a 60 year old! Sharp!<br />Thank you for reading
B000I8COBW|3.0|The highest production cost of the evil dead trilogy. Very campy, great one liners , but does not compare to Evil Dead II
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first. At first ,it seems harder to play because of the new obstacles. But you will soon get the hang of it and power up!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone. A real tear jerker. I also love Richard Gere. He did a great job.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|On the back cover it has a wonderful quote showing how much Audrey's character, Princess Ann, was a Cinderella.<br /><br />\\"At midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper.\\"<br /><br />Her \\"slipper\\" being the 1948 Fiat 500 B 'Topolino'.  Having everyone jammed inside this was quite funny.  Especially seeing tall Gregory Peck go inside this small little car.  The movie [[ASIN:B003B3V0N4 When In Rome]] must have been inspired because they did the same thing.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn really did deserve this award.  I thought she performed quite well as the Princess who just wanted a normal life.<br /><br />I very much recommend this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was prowling Amazon looking for books to read and came across Wool Omnibus Edition.  I found the concept intriguing and saw great value in the price as it included 5 books.  I got through Wool 1 and was hooked... I looked at it as a great short story and then figured out why it was so cheap, it was a collection of short stories not books.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />The Wool series branches out from this first brief tale into more book length editions and progresses in a fashion that kept me hooked as a reader and hungering for more.  Each story digs deeper (pardon the pun... for those who have read it) into the story and wraps up the past beautifully in Wool 5 and I'm assuming segways into the new legacy being created in Wool 6 and beyond (I'm going to be purchasing those now).  In my opinion, you will be hard pressed to find a better value on Amazon in the Kindle book store.  Highly recommend!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is cool and it has no problems. I am on level 50.also there is a sale for every holiday
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|well I realy like this game and leps world 1 I love love this and if u go on club Penguin and u see italyleia friend me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game. Everything is very well thought out and the graphics tell a lot. I really like how there are different places to be at. Great game!!!!!!!
B00074CBIS|4.0|THE TAXI DVD ARRIVED ON TIME AND WITH NO DAMAGE. THE MOVIE WAS WATCHED THE NEXT DAY WITH NO PROBLEMS.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The book \\"Quiet\\" is a great book to help introverts understand and better appreciate their temperament. The author points out that introverts are at times unfairly judged negatively & introverts themselves often think negatively of some of their traits. The author and research sited dispels this negativity and explains the personality of introverts in a wonderfully positive light.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My teens really enjoyed this movie. The music was very entertaining.  The cast was talented The singing was very good. I would recommend this movie
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Over the holidays, my niece got a larger Friends LEGO set and I helped her put it together (it had around 1200 pieces!). I was once again bitten by the LEGO bug. I hadn't played with LEGO's for nearly 20 years but now I had to! I looked around LEGO's website to see what kinds of sets were available - I had seen all the movie sets and what not already in the stores, but wanted something more interesting... Saw these Creator sets and I just had to have them. I ended up getting the 4 that are currently available (Town Hall, Pet Shop, Fire Brigade & Grand Emporium). Too bad the other 2/3 are valued so highly and cost around $1000 each (too rich for my pockets!) but I am looking forward to the Chinese Theatre that will be coming out sometime this year. I wish they made more than 1 of these each year! This set took me about 6-7 hours to complete and it is magnificent! I did a time lapse photo shoot of it as well (which may have increased my build time a little). I've completed 3 out the 4 sets I've purchased and they are some of the best looking sets I've seen and truly had a blast putting them together. One the best parts about these buildings is that they are designed to be connected together to make a street out of them. Can't wait to get more LEGO sets to build in the future.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I just loved this album from beginning to end. If people were unhappy with Bionic, then this defiantly makes up for it. This album is much easier to listen to, and is very uplifting, has confidence and power. We now see Christina in a different state of her life. She Has overcome the lows and is now proving that she is still on top and in charge. My personal favourites are Army of Me, Red Hot Kinda Love, Your Body, Make the World Move, Circles, Blank Page and Around the World (but every track is great). I like the sound this album presents, it's very electronic and dance. You can defiantly see that a lot of time, effort and money has been put into this production. Before you go out to buy other generic, modern pop music, consider this album. You will not regret it. Enjoy!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever ... it's way better than temple run or any other game<br />This is basically all I play ..
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|so far .. its great though i just got it.. its just like mario except the controls are harder .. but its fantastic and i reccokend that anyone who likes mario should get it!!!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey Collector's Edition is a really nice compilation of &#34;different&#34; video games : you don't kill people, you don't race fast cars..... you simply enjoy the moment !<br />You &#34;feel&#34; the games....<br />This compilation is really nice, with a lot of extras inside :images, themes, soundtracks, etc.<br />These games are very relaxing, and you can play for 5 minutes only to 1 hour if you want....<br />This compilation is a nice gift to angry players.. with an opened mind.
