B0000AXE8I|5.0|I am surprised how much negative publicity this has gotten. To me it was the best movie of the summer. It might have left the audience wanting more or asking questions but that's what it was supposed to do. The actions scenes were absolutely fantastic although the fight scene with Agent Smith did continue for just a tad too long. However with that said I came away awe-struck. The chase scene had my heart pounding every step of the way. I love action movies and this far surpassed my expectations unlike Tomb Raider 2 which was a waste of an afternoon. I can't wait for the finale...
0780626478|5.0|We are now all familiar with &quot;situation comedies&quot; that are forced to use a soundtrack due to the inability to arouse any response - particularly laughter - from a live audience.  Then we were faced with a barrage of film &quot;comedies&quot; in which the only common themes were grossness, an inability to act and universal idiocy.  <br />BLAST FROM THE PAST is indeed a blast - a full-throttled engine for enticing laughs from the viewer.  An eccentric Sacramento Valley man (played to perfection by Christopher Walken) builds an enormous underground fallout shelter and the expected event  happens:  Thinking a nuclear war has started he locks in his wife, Sissy Spacek, who would have stolen the show if not for the dazzling performance by Brendan Fraser who stars as the son raised for 35 years underground.<br />Upon surfacing he goes forward with baseball cards (originals of the greats) and stock certificates and through a series of hilarious events slowly convinces the girl of his dreams (Alicia Silverstone) that he is who he says and in the end, they all live happily ever after.  <br />It is hard to select favorite scenes but the double entendres and new jargon (for our hero) are favorites as well as his introduction to new technology.  The over-the-top jitterbug with two ladies was worth the price of the movie. This is one for the collection.
B00001NFCY|1.0|I think that the following statement -a very typical stance on the Creed-- made by a previous reviewer will facilitate the deserved bashing of  \\"Human Clay\\": <br />\\"... 1) Although the Vocalist (Scott Stapp) does sound slightly similar to Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam, 2) the music of Creed is nothing like Pearl Jam and takes influence from Metallica and the Doors.\\"<br /> 1):   \\"Slightly similar\\"?  This guy is trying to tell me that my eardrums have somehow transmitted an errant signal to my brain?  That what I thought was Stapp's blatant mimicry of Eddie Vedder --on songs such as \\"Say I\\" and \\"Wrong Way\\"-- was actually some audible illusion?  An audible deficiency of mine?  As if to insinuate that what I actually should have been hearing was a sincere and individual voice, with the mere exception that Stapp's voice just happens to \\"sound slightly similar\\" to one of the most famous voices in rock `n roll history?  If all of these things are true, I beg this reviewer to please explain why thousands of other nu-rock band vocalists also \\"sound slightly similar\\" to Eddie Vedder.   <br />Odds are that the reviewer would defensively, stubbornly, and, especially, conveniently avoid this insurgent tidal wave of potentially-damaging questioning, and -as if nothing happened-- continue his blind journey with the millions of credulous others who are likewise content to surf the monotonous wave of Stone Temple Pilot vocal banality.  So let's pretend that the reviewer possessed a shred of integrity, and gave me the sensible and truthful (yeah, right)-- answer:  <br />\\"Well, Bubbis Thedog, the inflection in the voice of Stapp is clearly intended to mimic that of Eddie Vedder and Scott Weiland (as evidenced on the corny \\"Are You Ready: and \\"What If\\").  You see, Eddie Vedder and Layne Staley were vocal catalysts of the \\"alternative\\" movement, which proved quickly to be an enormous financial success (Low sound engineering costs and cheap stage sets, coupled with high sales was a heavenly dream to record companies.).  So then, Weiland decided to knock-off Staley's trademark look and sound, but effectively meshed Staley's voice with Vedder's in order to create a vocal hybrid that would attract listeners of both singers to Stone Temple Pilots.  And that's pretty much where it all began, which is why you've heard that same hybrid voice for the past ten years over the same quasi-aggressive music.  It's just so easy to do: to contort your voice the way Weiland did...  And they're making a killing off of it.  So, Bubbis: what I suppose I meant was that Stapp sounds slightly similar to Vedder, AS WELL AS -sorry I forgot to mention-- slightly similar to Weiland.\\"  So we have a new hybrid then?  Enough said.<br />2):   Folks, I'll be the first one to tell you that it is natural to build off of artistic influences, thus potentially improving the initial idea.  But with Creed's \\"Human Clay\\", there is not a single step taken forward.  Of course, those who have fallen victim to conglomerate music chicanery (Stone Temple Pilots, Staind, Nickelback, post-...AJFA Meta-licka, and Godsmack, to name a few) are not immediately willing to accept that they have been condescended; that they have been persuaded to spend their money on countless CDs with the same 4/4 drum beats; the same mindless electric guitar riffs and predictable solos; the same counterfeit voice.  Why adults continue to blindly subscribe to nu-rock clones' rubbish, such as Creed's ridiculous tome, \\"Human Clay\\", as adolescent girls subscribe to Britney Spears' money-driven, prepubescent love-cries eludes me.  <br />And how in the world does the reviewer conclude that Creed is influenced by Metallica?  I completely agree that they do not sound exactly like Pearl Jam (a stupid, hasty comparison simply because Stapp's stylings resemble heavily those of Vedder), but...  METALLICA?  Because Creed plays aggressively, they're all the sudden influenced by Metallica?  This is an unfounded, hilarious remark, andis immediately discounted in my book. <br />Look, people: I understand that Creed has supposedly good intentions.  But, if they have something positive, yet unique to say (which I myself am famished for) they need to utilize a different medium.  As with most modern bands, the lyrical emotion of \\"Human Clay\\" is not consistent with the music.  Inspirational undertones blended with senseless garage band-aggressiveness result in a bittersweet product.
B00005T7I1|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said about this semi-dark example of &quot;film noire&quot;?  Everything about the movie reeks professionalism but in order of importance we have character, mood/setting and plot.  <br />Whoever chose the actors and actresses deserves a special commendation.  After viewing the file for perhaps the fifth time it seems no one could have been a better Tracy than Beatty and Madonna's part seemed absolutely natural as the temptress / schemer / wannabe lover, the perfect Tess and the irrascible &quot;kid&quot;.  The period setting and dark, Chicago, night clubbish modd was near perfection and was only enhanced by the fabulous Sondheim score that blended into the plot effortlessly. <br />The actions was straight-forward:  Good cop vs Bad criminal.  And in the end the good guy wins but not without pangs of regret for what might have been.  The cameo performances were just the right touch and the tongue-in-cheek attitude stayed to the end.
B000000LZV|3.0|I never really saw why this album is so lauded by critics and fans alike. There's definitely some great stuff on here (History Lesson, Dr Wu, The Toe Jam) but I think too many of the songs sound similar and it's tough to take 45 songs in a sitting. Certainly not a bad album at all but personally, I prefer their collections of early singles over this. So there! hmmmm
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am a huge fan of broadway and musicals in particular.  As a working Mom I don't get out to the theatre that often, broadway, or the movies.  When Moulin Rouge came out I was very excited, so I made the trip to theatre.  I was extremely disappointed.  It just didn't sit well with me. As a consequence, I wasn't in a rush to see Chicago, especially after everyone raved about Moulin Rouge.  Well, what a mistake.  I just recently saw Chicago and I was blown away.  They did such a wonderful job adapting it for the big screen.  It was brilliant.  The cast was perfect, the visuals were wonderful, the music was great!  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of musical theatre.

0792836634|1.0|Child's Play is the kinda movie one would think up in a nightmare: an evil doll who runs around with a knife stabbing people.  I know this film tried to be scarey and tried to give a reasonable explanation for why a doll is going around stabbing folks, but it didn't work.<br />OK, Chucky is a doll possessed by some evil guy's soul thanks to some voodoo dude.  Already this is laughable.  So this doll, for no real reason, goes on this rampage of stabbing anybody it wants and laughing as he does it.  I mean, nothing is scarey about this.  One minute a woman is walking around in the house, the next thing you know there's this red-headed doll, in overalls, screaming and stabbing her.  Then after it does its butchering it scurries away laughing like a A-typical villain.  <br />Please, if I took my teddy bear, installed fake dracula fangs in its mouth and gave it a cattle prod as a weapon, my form of \\"child's play\\" would be much more scary.  <br />Not to mention the way this doll talks is funny.  It cusses, it makes these stupid grunts, and these \\"one liners\\" that does little to entertain you.  It would be far more entertaining if Chucky accidentally drowned himself in the washer or finds himself getting molested and torn to shreds by the family's super horny pet.<br />And this is yet another monster movie where the monster won't die at the end.  That's right, you kill it, but it comes back.  You kill it again, think it's dead, but suddenly attacks you again around the corner.  Kill it again, think it's dead this time, but comes after you again.  Then when it dies, you think to yourself \\"why am I watching this movie?\\"<br />I'm sorry, nothing proves to be a bad movie than a monster that has to die a million different ways before the film can end.  I would rather have seen someone just flush Chucky down the toilet than have this stupid head lying on the carpet saying \\"get them, get them!\\"  How utterly stupid.<br />I don't suggest you watch this movie.  But if you get your kicks by watching corny horror movies that are meant to make you scared but end up making you get belly aches from laughing, then be my guest.  Otherwise, find a quality movie.<br />Grade: D-
B00008O31H|5.0|This band stomps a$$.  I knew very quickly that this was the case, and really enjoy this CD.  I think this CD would reach it's apex being played in an older model, flat black, convertible Cadillac- cruising around and about half-way looking for trouble.  It just makes you feel cool- cool for having it, for hearing it, and for getting it.  I hope the band does well, but part of me enjoys the &quot;who the [heck] are the BLACK KEYS&quot; factor.
B000002J03|5.0|From the opening heavy riffs of Whole Lotta Love to the beautiful ending on closer Thank-You, Led Zep II hit the record shelves in late 1969 like a nuclear explosion. This talented but still rather unknown band followed their fine debut album with a monster that took the rock world (& even top 40 radio) by storm. Even in the age of Hendrix, Cream & The Who......Jimmy Page & Led Zeppelin produced a sound so big, so thunderous & original that a new term was invented, \\"heavy metal.\\" It was not a term the band was particularly fond of; because, it did not recognize the tremendous versatility of the group, but it stuck. From that day forward, Led Zeppelin would be the \\"hard rock\\" group all others would be compared to.<br />Whole Lotta Love with it's contagious riff & great solo, became a rock classic & even hit top 40 radio in it's edited form. The following Heartbreaker is a heavy, guitar tour-de-force that contains a spectacular solo by Page. Listen to that solo recorded some 34 years ago & you will know why Page influenced<BR>so many young guitarists at the time. Also, notice the use of guitar overdubbing which would become a Page trademark on all Zep albums. Few do it any better. Bonham's distinctive sound is fully developed on this 2nd album & to this day, no other drummer has been able to reproduce it. Plant's vocals are as great as ever & the Lemon Song is a wonderful example of the tight musical relationship he formed with Page. John Paul Jones rounds out this creative force with excellent bass & solid keyboards. Jones was a very important member of the group who's influence seemed to increase with every new recording. Every great group seems to have a \\"quiet\\" member & while Jones filled the roll, his contributions were considerable.    <br />Years of studio work in London in the early to mid 60's made Page & Jones naturals at producing records & working out the technical challenges of recording, prior to the age of advanced computers. The special effects on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" took weeks of work for producer Page to finally get right. It all comes together on this masterpiece of rock music that will be played by music fans discovering the wonder of Led Zeppelin for decades to come. This record is a must in anyone's rock collection.
0385504209|1.0|Food for thought, just thought I'd point out that one of the things most people point out as fascinating about this book is that it is set with the code and these secret organizations working in the background, this idea is less than original.  Funny, another setting, another genre, but has anyone who read this book read Black Madonna (Shadowrun, No 20) by Carl Sargent, Marc Gascoigne?  Not the same book I'll be the first to admit, but funny how you have a book that is not about Da Vinci, but is set with a backdrop about his code...  A little too similar for my comfort, I would love to know if Dan Brown ever read Black Madonna?  But I don't think I'd trust his answer.

B00000JLWW|2.0|This was not even the best version of Titanic and because a bunch of lovesick girls flocked to see Leo Dicaprio ( why I don't know ) it became a huge blockbuster. I don't care how much money it supposedly made overall, Titanic is a big waste of time.<br />I admire Cameron's approach with the Gloria Stuart rehash, but that got tiresome after the first two hours. Soon it was as if they forgot Gloria was telling the story and flew through too many instances after dragging on for two hours. Cameron made this movie not to entertain but for an Oscar because whenever a boring film drags on for more hours than it needs to, the director is looking for an award.<br />Cameron didn't stick to any facts about the Titanic. I'm talking about historical facts mind you. He got a bunch of insignificant things from other films and some books but he must not have done first hand research because everything he didn't know, he made up instead of questioning historians who knew first hand what the Titanic was like and how it was handled. This is a big part of our history and Cameron made fun of it to rake up money.  He disrespected the families of the victims when he turned the story into some idiotic western at the end when Billy Zane ended up chasing people with a gun! By that time I was already upset for wasting my money at the theater, but I was sickened from that point on.<br />The only great character was Kathy Bates. She is a wonderful actress and I love her wit and wisecracking nature in everything she's in. Kate Winslet was terrible. She might be able to act in other films ( I don't know because I don't watch her ) but she wasn't \\" Rose \\" at all. She was not convincing at being weak. I kept waiting for her to strike back at Billy Zane's temper tantrums instead she just sat there like a lump pretending to be a frail helpless creature. She whined and I was hoping she would have died at the end. Too bad she didn't.<BR>Leo was dry. He's usually good but the only thing he did well wasdraw girls to the movie theaters. Where are those faithful fans now? He could use them. Billy Zane was excellent though the part sucked. He never gets the recognition he deserves. Everyone else was wasted and not needed. Gloria Stuart may have been a good actress in her day but she wasn't too impressive here. Neither was Bill Paxton ( but then again when was he? ).<br />The computerized downing of the ship was entertaining for two seconds. Compared to the special effects these days, it isn't anything to fall over about. I found it tasteless to use the special effects the way Cameron did anyway. He was too busy trying to impress the industry instead of making a film worthy of retelling history.<br />Now that I've said all that...here it goes. If you are one percent of the world who hasn't seen this movie, don't feel you have to. Some people pump up this movie but others know the real deal. If it was so great how come you haven't heard of it in years? It was hyped up by executives and the studio. At first I thought it was just me and my family who thought the film sucked. But as I found out, millions of others felt the same way. Don't believe the hype. It was obvious that the film was only made to boost up Cameron's career after he stalled from the Terminator sequels.  Everyone knew it was a joke when Kate Winslet walked away with an Oscar nomination. She was the most unnoticeable and least interesting character in the entire yawn!<br /> This is a wasted effort and not a WONDERFUL film at all. Cameron trades in good story telling for cheap thrills. No wonder the momentum didn't last. Have fun on the top Titanic because your days are numbered.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This is yet another collection from Donna Summer and you can not complain about the songs on here because they are all classics. The 2 cd Anthology is a better compilation than this but I defy you to find a bad song here at all. The main reason for me to own this collection is the 2 new songs that are on Disc 1 -&quot;That's The Way&quot; and &quot;Dream-A-Lot's Theme(I Will Live For Love)&quot; that reunite her with the legend that is Giorgio Moroder. The second disc also contains the 12&quot; mixes for &quot;Dream-A-Lot's Theme(I Will Live For Love)&quot; (12&quot;Extended Remix-9:16) and You're So Beautiful(The Ultimate Club Mix-10:50) that are sure to be classics as well. Hopefully Donna will try and put out a new cd of brand new material or if there is another compilation from Universal in the next few years then try and put out a box set of ALL(and I do mean ALL) the 12&quot; dance mixes that Donna Summer has ever put out----I know I will buy it.
0743243307|5.0|Brick Lane focuses on the story of Nazneen who moves to a Bangladesh community in London when she is still very young. Her marriage to a man named Chanu was arranged and she had very little choice in what she wanted to do with her life. Her destiny as a housewife and mother seems to have been set, but one of the main focuses of this novel is questioning whether the individual can have a hand in forming his or her own destiny. This age old question is artfully contemplated as we follow Nazneen through a great portion of her life while she gives birth three times and cares for her husband. Much of the novel seems to pass in the calm routines of her daily life. However, now and then we are given glimpses of Nazneen's rebellious thoughts which signify that she is anything but a passive character. When she meets an attractive radical named Karim we are aware that everything could easily change.<br />Brewing beneath this internal and domestic struggle is a conflict in the community of Bangladesh immigrants who are caught between assimilation to English life and reinventing a shared space where they can express their religion and culture. Many of these people came to England with the hope of earning a fortune and returning to their own country triumphantly wealthy. This rarely happens. Many have to renegotiate their sense of their own identities to survive in a culture that is alien and sometimes hostile toward them. Political groups form in the community. Things come to a crisis. It becomes evident that the community is not as threatened by groups outside of itself as by it's own internal divisions. The fact that many of these Bagladeshi people live their entire lives in England and still feel like outsiders is illuminated in a scene where Chanu takes his family on a hilarious outing to view London like tourists.<br />Monica Ali gives tremendous dignity to all her characters. While many may feel a natural sympathy with Nazneen as a captive to her own household, the idealistic Chanu is drawn as a very complex and loveable character. He may be stubborn, unappreciative and lost in his own dreams. But he's also shown to be very loving, honest and loyal to his family. Throughout the entire novel Nazneen keeps in touch with her sister who lives a difficult life in Bangladesh. This gives a hint of the life she might have had if she had chosen not to obediently follow tradition and proceed with her arranged marriage. This novel is filled with humor and sorrow making it an extremely compulsive and delightful read. The familial struggles really transcend any national boundaries however formed they are by cultural traditions. Ali gives a truly universal story in a very specific setting.stic Chanu is drawn as a very complex and loveable character. He may be stubborn, unappreciative and lost in his own dreams.

B00005JKG7|3.0|&quot;The Fog&quot; is a great idea, and a valiant effort, bogged down by too many mistakes and cop-outs, but I still enjoy it and watch it maybe once a year. What it lacks in credibility is made up for by its moments of brilliance.<br />I'm sure it was hard to follow up on the success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, and perhaps John Carpenter was reaching too far, or trying too desperately not to repeat himself. Too many points in the script seem forced or like stock devices, and the final payoff doesn't really work. Somehow I expected more, and got less.<br />That said, there are still many moments in this film that are so good at creating a subtle mood of suspense and terror, that I feel compelled to watch them over and over again:<BR>John Houseman's cameo which opens the film is masterful in how it sets the tone for the whole movie; often what we don't see, or what we imagine, is more terrifying than what is ultimately shown. Carpenter seems to know this, but by the end of the film doesn't trust himself enough to stick to this formula.<br />The widescreen photography is very well-done for a small-budget horror flick, and the establishing shots of beaches and foggy evenings, with foghorns in the background, are excellent.<BR>Hal Holbrook is his usual engaging self; one of the most underrated actors anywhere; and despite rumors that he was not particularly charmed by this project, he does a great job.<BR>The shot of a shadow backing away from the door of a beach house on the first night of the &quot;curse&quot;, is a masterful display of timing and editing.<br />There are many more such small-yet-great moments in this film, and though it's not as good as &quot;Halloween&quot;, it is still worth owning, now that it's finally available in widescreen format, with some very interesting extras, and a hilarious blooper reel.<br />&quot;Who is that?&quot;, whispers a sailor observing the shadowy shapes standing on his deck, and that sums up what's great about &quot;The Fog&quot;; this movie is at its best when it whispers.
B00000IL67|5.0|You have to admire an artist how goes from 60s' psychedelia \\"Don't Blow You Mind\\" to odd songs such as \\"Balled of Dwight Fry\\" to pop/rock \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\" to late 70s' balleds \\"I Never Cry\\" to 80s hard rock \\"Poison\\" I found The Best of Alice Cooper just didn't have enough songs on it to satisfy me so I bought this. I am very glad I did. The box set itself is very well done. The book included is very informative. It has a commentary on each song(mostly from Alice, but a few others as well), some cool photos, and some quotes from other music artists about Cooper. The commentaries on the songs are a real highlight (for me anyway), because it explains alot of the songs. An example is \\"Dead Babies\\" on the suface it might appear rather sick, but it's acually not. All depends on how you look at it. One thing I admire about Alice Cooper is how blunt he is. He is definitely a great lyricist. Many of his fans didn't like it when he changed his stile in the 80s' and onward, I do however. As stated earlier, I admire a singer who changes over the years. Plus songs like \\"Poison\\" and \\"Hey Stoopid\\" are over the top hard rockers with great guitar solos. There are only a few things I don't like about the set. Five tracks from KILLER is a little much.\\"Gutter Cats vs. The Jets\\" is not what I would have included from SCHOOL'S OUT. \\"Alma Mater\\" or \\"Blue Turk\\" would have been better. \\"Cold Ethyl\\" and \\"Escape\\" are also would not be my choices from the NIGHTMARE album. \\"Steven\\" or \\"Some Folks\\" are better. When these few problems are compared to the rest of the set however, they are forgotten. David Bowie has been described as a music chameleon, but I think it is also a title for Alice Cooper as well and he is a great one at that.
B000002U8G|5.0|I can't think of a Pink Floyd album that engages all their essential elements quite like Meddle.  Everything that the popular Floyd became had its roots in this album and its good, but not great, predecessor Atom Heart Mother.  &quot;Echoes&quot; stands as the most important track in the Floyd library, bridging the gap between their psychedelic early days and the music they would go on to make on Dark Side Of The Moon.  But Meddle shows that Floyd has a sensitive side which is clearly on display in &quot;A Pillow Of Winds&quot; and &quot;Fearless.&quot;  These two tracks really make up the melodic meat of the album.  If the album had been a three track EP ending at &quot;Fearless,&quot; it would still have been as great as the album ended up.<br />You can't be a Floyd fan and not love Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, but Meddle deserves a spot in the ranks of the great Floyd albums.  In my estimation, that spot is the top.  If I have to choose a Floyd album to listen to, this one always ends up in the CD player.  Meddle is not as ostentatious as DSOTM and WYWH and The Wall, but that's why it's great.  It's still Floyd.  Even though it's underrated and understated, Meddle is still their best.
044022165X|5.0|The Rainmaker: Legendary<BR>****<br /> \\"Donny Ray sits with his cane between his legs, resting his chin on it.\\" In John Grisham's book The Rainmaker, the lawyer deals with clients very often. The author's purpose in writing this novel is to create a drama that will capture the reader until the end.<BR> Basically, a son goes to college and law school and then starts the lawyer life after he passes the bar. He starts his own firm after working for other people. He has some clients, but one big one in which he has put his hopes in. He then goes to court with the case. The end of the story comes soon after.<BR> In the book the setting has much to do in the way of understanding and comprehending where the characters are. Many times in the novel Grisham changes the setting fairly quickly, but in some places he leaves it where it is for a while. An example of a short setting is Deck and Rudy discussing things over a meal. The court room is a good example of a longer setting because Grisham keeps the story there for about eleven pages. <BR> There are many small characters in the novel, but only one real major character. Rudy Baylor is the main character, who is young and learning but matures throughout the book Deck, Rudy's assistant (\\"paralawyer\\"), is underhanded and conniving, but in and innocent sort of manner. Judge Kipler is like the elder; he is wise and very helpful. He is Rudy's arch enemy; he is older, knows the ropes, and a wanna-be that makes himself into a fool. Rudy and Drummond's personalities collide because they are different, and they are opponents. There is also Kelly who is a passionate person who bands with Rudy, but the rest cannot be told for the sake of the ending.<BR> The plot of the story happens to be excellent, but it takes awhile to achieve the goal of interest and suspense. This story gets off to a slow start when Rudy is obtaining information about the case, and getting a job. The action picks up after that though and the escape from the government by Prince and Bruiser along with the Kelly incident at the hospital picks up the plot and run with it. Of course the court case becomes the best of the plot it starts to wind down, but the end gives it closure with a good plot sequence.<BR> The lawyer jargon such as the \\"briefs\\" and the happenings that go on like the jury selection, are not normal because the readers don't usually know these things, but Grisham does a good job of explaining everything. Other than that the conversation and such are normal communicating language. Grisham's style is mostly descriptive and partially very easy to read and blunt.<BR> This book captures the reader and they won't want to put it down. It is intriguing, entangled with deception, lies, and court battles. It is capturing. Read this book or loose a great experience. This novel truly deserves a five star rating.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|\\"About a Boy\\" has a problem. Everyone thought it was a chick flick so men stayed away from it in droves. A modest hit in America, it suffered from the perception that it was yet another Hugh Grant movie whose target audience was women.<br />But, this is a movie for and about guys. It is a movie that does a great job of examining the isolation so many men place themselves in and their relationships to the boys who will follow in their footsteps. Its proof that every boy needs a father in his life.<br />Will (Hugh Grant) is a man who is living what a lot of us might see as a great life. Thanks to a hit Christmas single written by his father, a record Will happens to hate, Will does not have to work and lives the easygoing life of a bachelor in London. Although not quite rich, he is sufficiently comfortable with his income that he can own a great car, live in a nice apartment, and pretty much do as he pleases. He justifies both his existence and himself by openly admitting he is shallow, somewhat self-centered, and wants to stay that way. Because he is honest about himself he feels everyone should accept him as he is without criticizing him. Will believes that all men are islands and that they do not need strong relationships, so he constantly wanders from relationship-to-relationship with women, enjoying everything but having to break up with them when he tires of them.<br />Will is introduced to a single mom and pretends to like her child in order to date her. In reality he believes he wants absolutely nothing to do with children. When she breaks up with him because she is not ready for a serious relationship, he believes he has hit upon a new dating tactic: date single mothers who apparently are so tied up in getting their lives in order that they will break up with him.<br />In order to better pull off the [trick], he pretends to be a single father and joins a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). On a date with single mom, he meets a young boy, Marcus(Nicholas Hoult), who suffers with being an outcast at school and with having a depressed, sometimes-suicidal mom (Toni Collette), who Will at one point characterizes as \\"a barking lunatic.\\"<br />Marcus figures out Will's [trick], and sort of blackmails him into letting Marcus hang out at his apartment. Soon, unwillingly at first, Will finds himself trying to help Marcus blend in at school (after Marcus is harassed by other school kids, Will advises that Marcus make himself invisible) and advising him on dealing with girls and many of the problems a boy faces growing up.<br />Will then actually falls for a single mom (Rachel Weisz) and finds that the only way he can gain her interest is to  pretend to be a father, recruiting Marcus to play the part of son. Unfortunately for Will, he is actually growing emotionally and finds himself, in a strange bout of honesty, admitting he is not a father causing him to return his \\"island\\" status. Only he now finds he's not too happy with being an island and that he truly feels a bond with Marcus.<br />He attempts to save Marcus from potential social disaster at a school talent show, serving himself up to ridicule and deflecting all of the catcalls to himself and away from Marcus. Will eventually concludes that maybe he is not just an island, but part of an island chain. <br />The movie is filled with clever humor and one-liners and Hugh Grant is perfectly suited for the role of Will. In fact, its hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles in the film; it's perfectly cast. Yes it has a happy ending, but this is not a tear-inducing happy ending, its an ending that seems perfectly suited to those involved without becoming overly emotional or mauldin.<br />The movie, and book it is based on, are really metaphors for the lives of men. It is a great examination of the isolation that men place on themselves. Marcus is heading down the same road as Will, a life cut off from any real relationships, and it is only in developing whatamounts to a father-son relationship that both can find happiness and true growth as men.<br />Trust me, guys, while women love this film, it most definitely is not a chick flick and should be required viewing for every man who feels alone in the world and afraid of relationships.
0385504209|2.0|OK, let's see, I figured out the identity of the Teacher fairly quickly, solved all the riddles almost immediately (except in cases where key information was withheld), I knew the 10 digit account number well before the characters found it, realized immediately where the grail was, who sophia was, etc.<br /><br />The history of the grail was pretty pathetic. Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum covered much of the same ground much more creditably and didn't rely on as absurd of a conspiracy to make it all come together. The crediting, for example, of the biblical canon to Constantine was rather laughable, as anyone who has studied the history of the biblical canon would agree.<br /><br />If you thought this was a good book, do yourself a favor. Get Foucault's Pendulum and read the story done right.
B000003TAR|5.0|Ten years after its release, this album still really holds up. Even if this music was released today, I think it would still sound fresh. Nirvana, as a band, had an incredible energy and skill that beautifully complemented Kurt Cobain's poetic lyrics and wounded vocals. The pain, rage, and self-loathing in the music is so real and so sincere that it speaks to the wounded child in everyone. Because of this, the music has a strangely innocent quality to it. This album is just as much an antidote to the cheesy, contrived rock music of today as it was an antidote to the cheesy, contrived rock music of the early 1990's.

0671027344|5.0|I don't usually enjoy reading. Most books are long-winded and boring and overrated, but I totally loved The Perks of Being a Wall Flower. In fact, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading a book this much! I actually LOOKED FORWARD TO the time I had alone with the book, and that almost never happens to me. Please check it out. Another short, snappy book I liked: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. I think schools should throw out all those boring &quot;classics&quot; and start a brand-new list!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I just saw this DVD last night for my film studies class and I must say that both the movie and the transfer are top quality. Based on the print quality and production values, I would never have guessed that the movie is over 75 years old. There are a few missing scenes, but the titles fill in the gaps unobtrusively.<br />The story of a priviledged young man who discovers his father's underground empire of mechanization and virtual slavery is complex and engrossing. You can watch this movie from a variety of different viewpoints (economic, political, sci-fi, entertainment) and continuously discover new ideas.<br />And of course, the allusion to the Italian superspectacle, Cabiria (Moloch), portrays the machines as demanding human sacrifice to provide the life of luxury for those oblivious souls in the city above<br />My only complaint with the script is the fact that the director overemphasises the moral of &quot;brain and hands must be united by the heart.&quot; But this is a minor quibble compared to the gradeur of the movie. I did not have a chance to explore the special features.<br />I saw quite a few parallels between Metropolis and The Matrix. Not sure if the Wachowski brothers intended this, but it's certainly possible. Common threads: man living in underground cities, man subjugated by machines yet needing them to live, a savior who falls in love with his accomplice in liberating the people...the list goes on.<br />Truly the definition of a Classic film, right up there with Citizen Kane in its timelessness.
B00004RJ74|1.0|What can you say about a movie where during the screening I attended, fully one-half of the paying audience got up and walked out during the movie?  It is that bad.  This movie isn't funny, isn't entertaining, and frankly isn't worth the celluloid it was originally printed on.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this piece of excrement masquarading as a movie.
6305428042|5.0|To sum up how much I love this movie I taped it off tv, then I bought it on VHS and now I have ordered the DVD.  I watch this movie several times a year, not just at Halloween.  I only hope that they someday release the soundtrack for this one.  I would definately buy that too.
B00003CXCW|3.0|Even if you haven't seen this before, it is worth buying for the awesome transfer that they have afforded it, and also for the classic that it is ...<br />A silent screen actress lives in a fantasy world longing for the stardom she once had, to the point that she really believes it is all coming back.  Enter William Holden to help the fantasy come together.  What we end up with is a tragic story which demonstrates how loneliness can affect the mind.<br />Heaps of extras add to the appeal of this DVD.  A must own.

0792844890|4.0|Synopsis:<br />Spaceballs follows Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), running away from a wedding she doesn't want to go through with because she doesn't love the groom. She is captured by the notorious spaceballs in a plot to steal all the air from her home planet.  Luckily, she is rescued in the nick of time by Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and his side-kick Barf (Jon Candy), a mog, half man, half dog and his own best friend.  They are chased by the Spaceballs, led by Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis), a pint sized Darth Vader wannabe.  Add Mel Brooks styled comedy and satirical movie references and you have Spaceballs.<br />About the Movie<br />Spaceballs is easily one of the most entertaining Sci-fi spoofs ever made.  Mel Brook's films have a way of never taking themselves too seriously.  This film certainly doesn't, and it works wonders on the gut. There's a sort of comic genius in Spaceballs, and it's hard to know why it works so well.<br />Spaceballs makes fun of the entire Sci-fi genre, from Star Wars, the Alien movies, Planet of the Apes, to Star Trek and other classic sci-fi fare.  What makes it so entertaining is that it combines elements of all of these, one-liners, exaggerations, sight joke, and twists on elements in the movies it is lampooning, to make a solid story line that holds together while at the same time being extremely funny.<br />While the comedic writing certainly contributes to what makes this film so good, the best aspect of this film is the cast.  Somehow, every actor manages to have perfect comic timing (though film editing undoubtedly helps). The cast is led by several great comic actors, including the late John Candy, Rick Moranis, George Wyner and Mel Brooks himself.<br />Rick Moranis is probably the most notable of the bunch, the perfect casting choice for a glasses wearing caricature of Darth Vader.  Watching him trot around the Spaceball ship in that oversized Vader helmet is hilarious, as he brings a sort of goofy pretentiousness to the role. He is easily the star of the film, though by no means the only one.<br />Dick Van Patton and Joan Rivers also play major roles if the film, as Princess Vespa's Father and the voice of Vespa's personal droid (modeled after C3PO of Star Wars), respectively.  Joan Rivers is perfect in her role, her gravely New York accent is so incongruent from what we'd expect from a brass colored droid.<br />If you love Sci-fi or slapstick comedies, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's a delight to watch and pretty darn funny.<br />About the DVD<br />\\"Spaceballs: the DVD\\" comes in a hard case on a double sided DVD with both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film. The case itself contains a two page leaflet that gives a few interesting production notes about the movie.<br />The picture and sound quality of this release are both pretty good.  The animated menus are humorous and are among the best of the features of the DVD.  The movie is translated into French and Spanish and has French and Spanish subtitles.  Strangely enough, there are no English subtitles.<br />For special features, the DVD comes with a short vintage featurette about the making of the movie, and a commentary by Mel Brooks.  The featurette is the \\"behind the scenes\\" type that was often released on TV shortly before a movie comes out. It contains a few actor interviews that give the sort of congratulatory remarks towards the director that are common in these sort of featurettes.  Over all it's rather unexciting and doesn't provide much entertainment or information about the film.<br />The director's commentary appears to be the one that originally came with the Laserdisc release of this film in the late 80's and early 90's.  If you actually happen to be one of the few people who had this movie on laserdisc, you'll find nothing new here.<br />As far as commentaries go, this one, done by Director Mel Brooks is mediocre at best. Directors who make commentaries should really watch the movie at least once BEFORE theymake the commentary.  It's clear that Brooks hadn't seen the movie in years, and it hurts the commentary's quality.<br />Brooks spends most of the time telling us who the actors are (repeatedly), complimenting them for their senses of humor and laughing at the in movie jokes.  If that's what you like in a commentary, great, but I would have preferred a more meaty information about the production. There is some of this in the commentary, but not a lot.<br />Bottom Line: A 5 star movie on a 3 star DVD release. 4 Stars.  Definitely worth picking up.y make the commentary.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|The first Matrix was excellent because it was most people's first introduction to wire fighting, it was the first movie to use \\"bullet time\\" (a term coined by the Matrix's special effects guru) and it has a huge plot twist in the middle of the movie.<br />None of these things are novel anymore. Since the first Matrix, a thousand movies have used wire fighting and bullet time. I think it's not the content of the movie but the lack of another paradigm shift that has people disappointed in this movie.
B00003CXB4|4.0|It is hard to believe that this was thought of as a secondary or B-movie at the Disney studio. Lion King is probably the best post-Beauty& the Beast 90's Disney movie. This movie brought it all together very well. After this movie, Disney took this format of animated movie and ran with it, although I personally think this was the peak of their greatness. This movie, much like all great Disney movies, have aged very well. The animation, effects, and story still hold up. The only minor complaint is the fart humor, but I suppose it gives the kids a laugh. There have been some reviews that the movie is too dark for kids but I think kids are smarter than we think. I give kids more credit than that. I believe kids like to be taken on an emotional roller-coaster when their watching movies just as much as adults, whether it be scared or sad. <BR>   The DVD is standard Disney DVD fare. It has a commentary track which isn't mentioned anywhere on the packaging but is a nice suprise. Most of the extras are worth your your time. Some of the extras are commercials for Disney World and other Disney merchandice disguised as entertainment. The extras are also kind of hard to navigate through. It would be nice to have a play all feature for all the DVD extras. The new \\"morning report\\" segment in the Special Edition version doesn't add much to the movie but it doesn't take away that much either. Both versions of the movie look and sound beautifully in widescreen format. This probably isn't the best Platinum edition Disney has put out but it is well worth it for the movie alone.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|...<br />Firefly is probably the first of its kind.  It seamlessly blends Western and Science Fiction elements into one cohesive whole, adding into the mix deep characters and more wit than your average sitcom - in an hour long drama series.<br />One of the problems leading to its demise was the difficulty of marketing such a show; most who enjoy Westerns do not enjoy Science Fiction, and vice-versa.  But in this case, it just works, for both parties.  It's a shame neither gave it enough of the chance for it to survive FOX's mishandling of the series.<br />But now we have the DVD set.  All 14 episodes including those never aired are contained within this package.  Not only that, but this set is cram-packed with enough special features to last you almost as long as the episodes themselves.  With this and a full theatrical motion picture on the horizon, Firefly is far from over.<br />And even if you're not a fan of the show, now is the time to give it a try.  It was, plain and simple, one of the best shows aired on TV in recent times.  It, in this reviewer's humble opinion, surpassed even Joss Whedon's other creations, with higher believability, better characters, and wittier dialogue.  The dialogue, in fact, has not yet been matched by any show I have ever seen - and I've seen a few.<br />If you're a Firefly fan, buy this box set.  If you're not a Firefly fan, buy this box set and become one - you won't regret it.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I've never seen a shooting star burn so bright and so long. Until Johnny Cash. His light has burned a permanent glow in the eyes of all, especially Americans.<br />  I've heard many of his songs through my short life, so far, and have always gotten a great feeling of pride. This album is so comfortable, so easy to listen to. It surprises you, makes you smile and feel good, but \\"hurt\\", especially the video,  makes your eyes tear (if you let it). I love the fact the even though his vocal range is limited now, he is still able to sing with such emotion. Most performers strain, hit high notes, stress there voice and make comical faces to show they're singing from the heart, but not Cash. He fills the room with such feeling and soul just by talking through a song or singing in his baritone voice. \\"The Man Comes Around\\" and \\"Hurt\\" are my favorite, six stars. The rest are enjoyable and would rate them three to four stars. It makes for an album that I would listen to only at certain times, but, will truly enjoy it when I do.

0316666343|4.0|\\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\"  This disturbing, yet summarizing quote appears in Alice Sebold's fictional drama, The Lovely Bones.  The book from beginning to end is full of horrific tragedy, sorrow, suspense, and hope all at once.  Sebold uses the gruesome death of the protagonist, Susie, to allow the reader to open their eyes to every aspect involved with not only murder, but death itself.  The author achieves this purpose by allowing Susie to tell the story from her perspective in Heaven.  Not only is the reader informed of the victims past, but also is shown how her family and friends are able to live their lives in the years following her murder.  The most disturbing aspect of the book,is that the reader enters the diluted mind of her killer, and sees just how sick and twisted some people can be.  <br /> The story begins by describing the hideous details of Susie's murder by her neighbor Mr. Harvey, the antagonist.  Although Mr. Harvey's character leads the reader to be utterly disgusted throughout the book, he works well in the story.  This fact is evident because he shows the true nature of a serial-killer, which is something most people are defiantly unable to relate to or even imagine. After the first chapter the reader enters two different world's, Heaven and Earth, and also into the lives of other many diverse and interesting characters.  Throughout the story there is a constant need and longing by the family of the victim, especially her father, to locate Susie's body and killer, who he suspects is Mr. Harvey.  The book is able to show how Susie's sister and friends mature after her death, something Susie realizes she will never be able to experience.  Overall it is a touching account of how some people are able to cope, and how others' are permanently scarred after the death of a loved one.<br /> \\"In the drawing a thick blue line separated the air and ground...an In-between, where Heaven's horizon met Earth's.\\"  This image is how one reading this book should perceive the setting of the story.  Susie is 14 when she is murdered in a small town in 1973, and the book describes the lives of the characters' from that time to the mid 1980's.  Also, during the book, the story constantly switches from the past to the present.  This technique used by the author works very well in the story, because it shows the relationships Susie had with her loved ones while she was alive, which proves why she continued to follow their lives.  The setting of this story adds so much beauty and depth to the book, by allowing the reader to see the wonders of the Heaven Susie lives in after her death, and how it relates to the Earth her body once occupied.<br /> The character's in this story are what make it so out of the ordinary, because deep detailed descriptions are given, of a combination of the good, the bad, and the evil.  Susie Salmon is of course the protagonist, and represents all that is pure and sacred in the life of a teenage girl.  Mr. Harvey represents the appalling and disturbing aspects of a mentally disturbed human, which unfortunately occupy the world today.  Mr. Salmon is Susie's father, and brings about the sorrow in the novel.  His character shows how strong and precious the father-daughter bond in life truly should be viewed as.  Mrs. Salmon represents the part of everyone that wishes they could be someone else, and after the death of her daughter becomes horribly lonely and confused.  Lindsey is Susie's sister, and provides a sense of hope to the story in the way that she is able to grow up into exactly what Susie would have wanted her to.  <br /> The Lovely Bones is told in 1st person omniscient point-of-view by Susie.  Of course Susie encounters an external conflict with Mr. Harvey in the novel when she is murdered, but she also experiences an internal conflict throughout the book.  This conflict results from the fact that she cannot decide whether she should let her family go, or continue to watch their lives unfold before her eyes in Heaven.  Mr. Salmon also experiences a huge internal conflict, because he is unable to allow the thought of his daughter escape his mind, and in a way feels guilty for not being able to find, and punish her killer.<br /> Many literary techniques are used throughout this novel.  The most recurring of these techniques are flashbacks.  In the story, Susie tells about something that occurred during her life while she was alive, and then all of a sudden the setting is switched back to the present which she is viewing from Heaven.  Many beautiful and descriptive similes are used in the story.   An example of a simile occurs when Susie describes souls floating from Earth to Heaven being \\"like snowflakes.\\"  The reader is also able to get a sense of just how sick Mr. Harvey is by disconcerting sensory images that are used, such as \\"the blood I tasted was bitter.\\"<br />The Lovely Bones is an extraordinary book that any teenage girl or women could relate to in some way.  Not only does it show how death is life-altering, but also how lives can be restored and that hope should never be lost.  Anyone who reads the novel will have more respect for the preciousness of life and family.  It also proves that everyone should live each day of their life as if it were their last, because unfortunately tragedy can happen.  Overall, this book is suspenseful, well-written, and in many aspects rejuvenates the soul.

B0000C7PQK|3.0|I am an avid fan of Enigma and consider Cretu a very talented composer, as he has shown to be in the earlier albums. Yet, over time I feel his albums are becoming less and less of my liking.. for instance, he made a terrible decision in LSD leaving out the original TNT For The Brain mix and including that horrible one...<BR>And now he has released Voyageur. Like other reviewers have pointed out, he has focused too much on beat and lyrics, leaving out what really enticed me in his music: the ethereal, subtle layering of enigmatic samples and chants, beats and mesmerising melodies/basslines... good examples of this are Mea Culpa, Smell Of Desire, Principles Of Lust, etc. - instead, he chose to replace them with distorted lyrics (I personally despise the &quot;That's the look, that's the look...&quot; voice featured in &quot;The Look Of Today&quot;) and non-memorable melodies... I can only rescue &quot;Boum Boum&quot; for its bassline (even though I cannot relate those pop-ish lyrics with Enigma at all), &quot;Voyageur&quot; for its nice intro (even though it becomes monotonous) and &quot;Following The Sun&quot; (again, nice melody, but too mainstream-sounding). Other songs like &quot;Page Of Cup&quot;, &quot;From East To West&quot; and &quot;The Piano&quot; are ok, but the rest are simply not memorable. Also, I don't really like the vocalists he chose, Sandra should have been in replacing Michael's singing (his singing tends to be rather anticlimactic, like in the song &quot;Why...&quot;). <br />Overall, I would have given &quot;Voyageur&quot; 2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because I do have respect for the talent Michael Cretu showed in his outstanding first albums. Too bad he decided to take a different road with his music. If you consider yourself an Enigma fan, I recommend you to listen to it before you buy it.

B00005JLKB|4.0|SMALLVILLE is a fresh look at an American icon around since 1938. The writing is smart and sophisticated. The first season stories obviously needed a little time to develop into what is rapidly becoming an incredibly well written and well developed series.<br />This DVD set is an excellent transfer and has some fine extras, such as commentaries of the first two episodes and other extras. However, there are some &quot;extras&quot; that are simply missing and could have easily been part of the boxed set.<br />The previews of the next week's episode is unfortunately missing. These scenes would have made wonderful additions to the set. I originally videotaped the series from television and I will miss these teasers that are not included in the DVD.<br />Another major disappointment is that there are no clips or even the full show of the original pilot that was filmed before Annette OToole won the part of Martha Kent. This would have been a wonderful extra. Unfortunately, we may never experience this bonus feature.<br />Other than these unfortunate facts, this DVD set is outstanding and the series itself deserves great praise. I look forward to the second season and all seasons afterwards.

B000002OTL|5.0|i am a fan of quentin tarantino. not a hardcore fan, but a fan nonetheless. i have loved all his movies that he has made the best being Pulp Fiction and then Reservoir Dogs. by getting the soundtrack to Pulp Fiction, and reading the track list for RD, i cam to the assumption that Mr. Tarantino loves old music. I've got one thing to say about this CD: if you like older music like Dick Dale and Dusty Springfield, then you will want this soundtrack and like it. If you want modern music that was inspired by the movie, you're not gonna get it. A bonus of this CD is the inclusion of some of the best dialogue from the movie except the first bit of dialogue which wasn't necessary. BUY THIS CD!
B000066NW0|1.0|Has anyone else out here wondered why there are 10 different versions of this cd?  Do we know of anyone else that puts out that many versions of an album to make money?  This is just another stereo-typical pop-punk record designed to sink your wallet in the toilet.  The songs are uninspired and horrible.  But, you can't blame Avril...seeing as how she wrote little to none of the music on here.  I would even choose Blink-182 over here even with as bad as they suck.  Don't waste your money on this cd...it is THAT bad.
0380789035|2.0|Having heard loads of good things about Gaiman's work, and this huge novel in particular, I decided to check out this story of the decline of &quot;old&quot; gods in the face of the &quot;new&quot; gods of technology. The notion that the power of gods is derived from belief in them is a fairly basic one, and forms the underlying framework for &quot;the coming storm&quot;, where the old gods in America band together to fight the new ones. The premise here is that centuries of immigrants have brought their native gods to the shores of America, where, we are told, there were no gods. Gaiman uses a few flashbacks to show these gods in action, which are some of the most effective bits of writing in the book. But there are three main conceptual flaws in the premise. The first is that the American mainland was hardly a tabula rasa, there were plenty of Native American deities in place (Raven, Wolf, Turtle, etc.). Secondly, does that mean that there are multiple manifestations of deities-one per geographic location? If the Norse gods die off in America due to dwindling belief, does that mean they live on in Scandinavia? Thirdly, the book totally ignores the monotheistic traditions which dominate modern American belief, which seems like a massive cop-out by Gaiman. Of course, this is a work of fantasy, and one doesn't look for total realism-but these issues undermine the internal logic of the story.<br />The story's protagonist is the cheesily names Shadow, who we meet right before he is released from prison. Upon his release, he is enlisted by the leader of the &quot;old&quot; gods, Wednesday, as a bodyguard. It's troubling that Shadow never seems that perturbed by Wednesday's creepy knowledge of his life, and it's one of the books central flaws that Shadow takes the most bizarre, X-Filesque events in stride, barely batting an eye. He's such a non-reactive character that it's a real struggle to care about him at all-which is a major problem as he is the center of the story. The two set out on Gaiman's attempt at that most traditional of American genres, the road movie/book, as they attempt to organize a coalition of old gods to do battle with the new ones. So, basically, the whole story is a buildup to this massive battle, which... Well, I won't give it away, but it's likely to disappoint many readers. More problematic is the pace, which is numbingly sedentary. The book drags on and on and on at a steady pace, only to culminate in the aforementioned non-climax.<br />Along with these issues, readers who know their Norse pantheon will probably spot the book's big reveal well in advance (Shadow's prison buddy, Low Key and his boss Wednesday, bear names decodable by a child with an interest in Norse mythology). This is not to say there aren't portions that are well written and intriguing, but as a whole, the book is an unwieldy mess of ideas and scenes. Gaiman clearly has talent and imagination, but sustaining a narrative of this length appears beyond him at this point.The two set out on Gaiman's attempt at that most traditional of American genres, the road movie/book, as they attempt to organize a coalition of old gods to do battle with the new ones.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie was a drawn out, overhyped, tooth pulling experience. The fights lasted forever. The jibberrice spoken was boring and repetative. First movie I ever walked out of. I enjoyed pranking my friends on their phones over watching this bore of a movie.Killed my plans of buying the box set.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I just picked up the new Jet cd and it sounds pretty good.<BR>The heavier songs like 'last chance', 'cold hard b****',<BR>'get me outta here' sound like classic ac/dc. The slower<BR>songs are a little boring. Overall the cd sounds good.<BR>I think Jet has a good future.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|This is a good album, and if you're a fan of Muse, I'm sure you'll love it.  Since I bought it, though, I have grown increasingly annoyed with the whines and lyrics.  For example:      \\"I think I'm drowning, asphyxiated, I wanna break the spell that you've created.\\"    I've certainly heard worse, and really... I still like the album!  It's definitely a must-have in a Muse fan's CD collection.  But I find myself listening to \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" \\"Hullabaloo,\\" and \\"Showbiz\\" at least twice as often, each.  Still a good album, but now I'd give it 3.5 stars, instead of 5.
0385504209|5.0|A great thriller, whose shortcomings are more than made up for by its strengths. The factual historical and religious interweavings with a first-rate fictional plot make for educational reading--yes!--as well as page-turning reading. And it's even a bit daring in its summing up of a major religion.<br />One caveat: I came to this book as a layman who knew almost nothing about the Holy Grail other than what I learned from Monty Python. That obviously helped me enjoy this book. From reading the reviews below, if you have a PhD in theology, a lot of the suprises in this book won't be surprises.
B00006AUIG|2.0|Was REALLY disappointed in this film.  Starts slowly, seems like a typical haunted-house set-up - old, disused, abandoned building where disturbing things happened once; whispers are whisped; noises are heard in the dark; people die.  The end.<br />The part where Hank is collecting his stash was very well-done, but nothing else in the film WAS.  And the ending just went on and on and on with the stereotypical slasher stuff, gratuitously violent and, worst of all, in my opinion, decent, sympathetic people die, leaving me sad, not scared.  Whoever wrote the script did a poor job.<br />Do not waste your money/time on this poorly-done film.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|This is a reasonable album but too much of it slips quietly by and is quickly forgettable.  There are some outstanding tracks though as have already been mentioned (Pet, Weak and Powerless, Blue and The Outsider) but they are in the minority.  Far too many are mellow, overly-textured mood-tracks that end up creating an atmosphere but nothing else, and some of these are painfully drawn out.  I'm not suggesting that there should be more catchy pop-rock but if you're honest this doesn't have a lot of replay value, well not for me anyway.  <br />Imagine prog-rock drifting off to sleep for the most part with the occasional hard-hitting nightmare to keep you interested.<br />It's clearly a musical progression for APC, but it's also a step closer to the dusty end of my CD rack.  Mind you, this album would probably like it there... it's quiet, dark and it wont get disturbed very often.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a movie that never fails to score top marks every time. Even the truly horrible, full screen disc that was released a few years couldnt detract from the movie itself. When a 'Special Edition' was announced earlier this year, I was overjoyed! At last, this classic movie is going to get the teatment it deserves. Two discs, Widescreen, Commentary, trailers, making of, behind the scenes, interviews and deleted footage. But, lo and behold, when the 'Special Edition' arrived at my house, all it contained was the Widescreen version and Commentary. Nothing that would make it a special edition! On both DVD realeases there is a shot of the Griswolds collecting their Christmas tree with the site owner. This scene isn't included even though it was shot! Why include this shot on the packaging if it isn't in the finished movie? And why oh why are there no deleted scenes? If you have the fullscreen edition, it is a worthwhile investment to buy this disc (I can't call it a special edition) if only for the Widescreen element. All in all, Warners still treat this title with the contempt it totally doesnt deserve. And its even in a snap case not the better plastic cases that Warners are supposed to be using now! Hopefully by 2010, we will have disc that we truly can call 'Special Edition'.
B00008DYQA|5.0|WOW!  I really want to own this one.  It was realistic but didn't go too far.  It was romantic but not corny.  Perfectly sexy and thoughtful too.
B0000009SI|4.0|Every song on this CD shows the incredible genius of Frank Zappa, in my opinion one of the top 3 electric guitar players of all time.  He  was backed up by other rock greats such as Ansley Dunbar on drums, Jack Bruce on bass, and Sugar Cane Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty on violins, among others - as he should be, as not many artists of his time were capable of playing Zappa's music.<BR>The only disappointing feature of this CD is that this version does not have one of the songs I bought the CD for - Dynamo Hum.
0380789035|5.0|I loved this book. Completely and utterly, without question adored it. Neil Gaiman has a way of writing his novels that makes you believe that he's really not writing them at all, that maybe he has a muse locked up in his room that he coaxes these stories from (you know what I mean if you've read Sandman, Dream Country). This is an elegant novel that reads at a steady pace through its entirety, whereas another novel like this would flounder about or die horribly about halfway through. I have a realtively long attention span, but if a book is slow-paced, I lose interest right away. With American Gods, I found myself not wanting to put it down. It was long, but certainly didn't feel like it. Gaiman's character development skills astound me- every single one of the characters felt as though they were alive. American Gods is a refreshing look at the heart of the United States- written by an Englishman no less! The novel has mystery, murder, legend, lore, cunning schemes, ghosts, and of course, gods. What more could you ask for?
B000084T18|5.0|sorry for the title, i couldnt resist it, anyways, ive been reading other reviews on here and i just think that if your an angry 35 yearold loser who likes old-fashioned music, then stick to it, but dont come on, and act like you can give fair critisism of a man who worked hard at his dream, and became more succesful than you will ever be. Hell, i dont even like rap music, but i think that this is the kind of stuff that crosses all bounderies, and is just good listening. track 19 is the best on the album, probably my favorite rap song, it just kinda gives you a satisfied, arrogant feeling after hearing it.

1573225517|2.0|This main charecter in this book, Rob, made me want to go out and hang myself. You know why this guy couldn't get a woman to stay with him? He's a loser. Fellas, listen! Women want a MAN. And that, by default, implies that you can not be more over-run with your emotions than your mate is. My guess is--Rob's mother raised him to be the oversensitive blok (That's British for Loser), that he is. This guy Rob is so self defeating you almost wish he'd take up heroin injecting to make himself more interesting. This MAN (Insert laugh-track), is as sappy as the love songs that he quotes to death--over and over and over again. You see, Rob owns a record shop that, like the book, goes nowhere, and half way through, you wonder why you're still reading; and the answer is that it's an editor's trick. There's not a lot of words and there's lots of space between the lines, so get you an \\"airy\\" sensation in your mind, and are thus dupped into finishing a book that, like all pop songs, is just one bad, repeating chorus after another. I can't imagine ANY woman worth her weight in gold haning out with this guy, or the writer, who is obviously talking about himself in this story. Not all of Nick Hornby's novels are bad. \\"How to be Good\\"  was terrific enough to scare anyone away from marriage and for that, he should be given the Pulizter. But if you want a story about a guy who can't figure it out, who has no guts, and who has nothing interesting to say, by all means just go out and watch the movie.

B000069AUI|1.0|This band has the worst lyrics of anyone since Britney Spears. And they rip off the sound of mid-1990s Radiohead. Perfect music for anyone who wasn't cool enough to like Radiohead before they were superstars and who isn't smart enough to require lyrics to say anything a Hallmark card or 4th-grader couldn't.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I really, truly, thought the magic was gone when I heard that Jim Cameron wasn't going to work on this project.  I've never been so happy to be wrong.  Mostow did an incredible job meeting the high expectations that fans have for this series.<br />I'm not going to talk about the plot for fear of revealing too much, but I will say that this is the movie where John Connor finally meets his destiny.  This is where the questions and issues of a time paradox (ex: If Judgment Day never happened how did John's father come back in time?  Would he never have existed?) are finally answered (intelligently I might add).<br />And of course, Arnold (or Governor Arnold now I guess) absolutely IS the Terminator.  I don't think I have EVER seen a role more perfectly cast.<br />If there I had any complaints at all, it was mostly just for what I felt I was missing then anything.  I never thought I'd say this about an action movie, but I really wish there was a bit more dialogue and characterization for John Connor.  As I said before, this is THE MOMENT when he becomes the man he was destined to be.  I would have LOVED just a couple of extra minutes to watch him make the transition into the role.  <br />I'm holding out hope that extra footage will be added to the DVD.  I really got the impression that T3 was made with a strict eye on the clock.  The first two Terminator movies are around two hours (more for T2), T3 clocked in for almost exactly an hour and a half, if I remember right.  I honestly think that a lot was left on the cutting room floor; I'd love to see some of it integrated back into the movie.<br />Again, 4 out of five stars.  A very solid third entry into this wonderful sci-fi saga.
B000024MKV|5.0|I can't believe that no one's reviewed this yet!! First off-what a great band!! I love all the influences that I hear in their brand of hard/pop rock!! And they wear them all so well. Throw together Bad Company,Coney Hatch,AC/DC,Whitesnake,Van Halen..hell-you name it!! Just great 'pared-down' straight ahead rock n' roll,and a smattering of also-great ballads.Even a coupla cool tastefully done covers here ( Mighty Quinn &amp; He Ain't Heavy,He's My Brother). This is truely a great rock n' roll disc AND band. Get This NOW..you won't be sorry!Enjoy!!
B00005JM02|5.0|I was skeptical upon seeing this, but was surprised to find myself as a 19 year old guy loving it. The animation was great, the cast wonderful, and the story was pretty good. \\"Finding Nemo\\" revolves around a young fish and his over-protective father. The young fish (Nemo) is caught and ends up in a dentist office aquarium. His father sets off on an adventure across the ocean to find him meeting another fish (Dorie) on the way *fabulously voiced by Ellen Degeneres.* This isn't a movie just for kids. All ages will love it. Highly recommended family entertainment.
B00003OSTK|3.0|This is probably unfair to say, because the book &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; was based on has been out of print for decades and is incredibly hard to find, but this blockbuster Oscar-winning classic film is NOTHING compared to Vicki Baum's 1930 original German novel, &quot;People in a Hotel&quot;. I happened across the book in a dusty corner of a dusty used bookstore purely on a lark, never having seen the film, and didn't stop reading until the last page. It was one of the most moving, beautifully-written novels I've ever read; Vicki Baum's grasp of human nature, from bellhops to barons, is astonishing, and the writing (with assist from translator Basil Creighton) is heartbreaking and thrilling. Just check out this little passage. Grusinskaya (played by Greta Garbo in the movie), the aging, despondent fading-star ballerina, has just finished a dance:<BR>&quot;Curtain and applause. There was even fairly vigorous applause considering how empty the theater was and how few there were to clap. 'Encore?' asked Grusinskaya without stirring from her pose. 'No,' whispered Pimenov in a loud and desperate whisper from the wings. The applause was over. It was over. Grusinskaya still lay where she was for a few minutes like a flake of foam, just as she had died in her dance and with the dust of the stage on her hands and arms and temples. For the first time in her life there was no encore for this dance. I can do no more, she thought. No, I have done enough. I can do no more.&quot;<BR>Unfortunately this heartbreaking scene wasn't in the movie; it gave volumes of explanation as to why Grusinskaya was suicidal, so without it, Garbo just comes off as a melodramatic nutjob. There are many such scenes from the book that were chopped up or cut out altogether that would have added so much, and without them the film just jumps from plotpoint to plotpoint with little rhyme or reason. I know that 90% of any book has to go when being translated from book to movie---and I know that Vicki Baumherself wrote the screenplay, so it was hardly a hack job---but it just seems that so much beauty was packed into so little time that there was no way to really connect with these amazing characters. The acting was brilliant, of course (although why in hell ultra-American Wallace Beery had a German accent when nobody else did I have no idea), but it just left me sad and angered that this magnificent novel, now all but forgotten, leaves its only trace on the world with this watchable but hugely flawed movie. It could have been so much more. If you ever find the book, no matter what condition it's in, BUY IT. Maybe someday if enough people squawk, it'll come back into print.
0385504209|3.0|The book begins with Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon being roused from his sleep by the French Judiciare. The curator of the Louvre was found murdered in the museum's Grand Gallery, his body positioned in the manner of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man and a pentragram drawn on his torso with a cipher patterned after Fibonacci's sequence.<br />With Paris detective Sophie Neveu, Langdon seeks the truth about the murder. In the process, he gets entangled with the Priory of Sion (a secret society that counts Sir Isaac Newton, Boticelli and da Vinci as members), Opus Dei (a powerful religious organization sanctioned by the Pope) and the Vatican itself in pursuit of a secret that could alter the fate of mankind.<br />I have mixed opinions of this book. The New York Times calls it &quot;erudite fiction&quot; and I agree, definitely not your standard-issue suspense thriller. Author Dan Brown sprinkles the novel with ample historical information about art, religion and history, against the backdrop of cryptology and symbology. He intertwines conspiracy theories with historical facts to peel the skin off long-held beliefs that we always accepted as gospel truth.<br />On the other hand, this is still pop fiction; one gets the feeling that Mr. Brown has his eye on a movie deal. His prose is serviceable, but hardly memorable. His pacing also left me exhausted; with every short chapter a cliffhanger, the novel is like a neverending obstacle course on overdrive.<br />This book sufficiently entertains, if you don't mind myriad information that at times stretch credulity. If nothing else, it would make you want to Google away and check its veracity for yourself.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is essential not only to Ledheads, but to fans of all genres of rock and roll. The evidence of greatness is hear on this 2-disc set for all to see, Led Zeppelin is the greatest band ever. They sound as good, if not better, live than recorded. And, their stage presence and fellowship   shows how music can overshadow image. Now that shows how powerful and great a band can be.The Beatles were the first , the Stones lasted the longest , but Led Zeppelin shows everyone on this DVD that they rocked best.
B000089RVR|4.0|When I first listened to this album, I wasn't real impressed. It seemed really boring compared to &quot;No Angel&quot;. But then I gave it another listen, and liked it a WHOLE lot more. Then I gave it a 3rd listen, and liked it even more! It seems it's one of those albums that you enjoy more each time around. The album's first single, &quot;White Flag&quot;, is a good choice as an opening song, because it will feel very comfortable to Dido fans that loved songs such as &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;. The next song, &quot;Stoned&quot;, is a very soothing tune with some sad lyrics, but with an upbeat electronic drum track. &quot;See You When Youre 40&quot; is another sad yet upbeat tune, with probably one of the best choruses I think Dido's ever written. &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot; starts off with Dido singing really fast, which might throw you off for a second, but then you get used to it after you hear the chorus, which sounds like something you might hear from Sade or Everything But The Girl. &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; is simply Dido with acoustic guitar and drums, and sounds almost like a folk song. There are several other acoustic tracks on here such as &quot;Mary's In India&quot;, &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;, and &quot;Life For Rent&quot;. I'm very pleased with this album, if you don't like it at first, give it 1 or 2 more listens, and then you'll start to love it. In all honesty, this is probably every bit as good as &quot;No Angel&quot;. However, that album came out 4 years ago, so it's sort of become a classic already with Dido's fans...which means that no matter how good of an album she puts out, people will always say &quot;it's not as good as No Angel&quot;. But if you were to play both albums to someone who had never heard of Dido, they'd probably tell you that &quot;No Angel&quot; and &quot;Life For Rent&quot; are just as good as each other. If anything, it's great to finally have some new songs from Dido. So if you liked the last album, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.t album, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
0316286443|5.0|For those of us who love makeup, this is fun and inspires one to try something different!  I wish I had time, patience, and the vision of Kevin Aucoin to do some of these transformations, even if just for fun.  Along with demonstrating various &quot;looks,&quot; he takes (mostly) famous faces and transforms them into others with makeup--for example, he turns Martha Stewart (!) into Veronica Lake, Amber Valetta becomes Clark Gable AND Carole Lombard, and Gina Gershon morphs into Sophia Loren.<br />There are a few black women and fewer Asians, so if you are looking for a lot of diversity in this book, you may be disappointed.<br />Still, I love this book, even though I don't actually wear as much makeup as is shown here.  Some of never grow out of playing dress-up!<br />Rest in peace, dear Kevin.  You are missed.
B00005AAFS|5.0|With every cd, Rammstein have given us something different, which always keeps me interested and begging for more, and not to mention, curious as hell as to what their new album will sound like. Herzeleid was a much more &quot;angrier&quot; record, if you will. The highly overrated yet still awesome Sehnsucht was more focused on their Techno-Industrial Rock side which featured many great songs, but I personally think that Mutter stands above the rest. They seem to combine alot of their older elements in with some new suprises with their sound and lyrics on this one, as the guitars have a very cool, distinct sound to them this time around, as well as Till Lindemann's lyrics, which have always been dark and mysterious, and this album is the pinnacle of all of that. This one feels a little more diverse than the previous two, which is always great. Bands that progress, evolve and experiment with their music are the only ones that will truly matter, and last in the end, in my opinion. Rammstein is no exception. They have created one of the greatest Industrial-Rock albums ever with Mutter, from the dramatic strings of Mein Herz Brennt to the powerful guitar and keyboard-driven Ich will, the beatiful ballads of the title track and Nebel, and the fast, heavy, with an awesome solo in the middle of Adios, this album is truly unforgettable.
B00003CXDB|4.0|The greed is good speech in this film is not to be missed!  It captures the essence of capitalism - though the intention of the film is anti-capitalism!  Given the recent high profile scandals of late many would agree with the premise of this movie!  I don't, but that is another matter.<br />What's really at fault, and what I think this movie is, is an expos&eacute; of human nature!  When we are tempted, do we resist or do we eat of the forbidden fruit?  The question is age old, we know the answers, yet some of us set these issues aside - to be confronted with the equal and opposite reaction to our actions and the moral decisions they bring about!<br />This is what makes this a good film!
B0000039QA|1.0|This album is way too overrated by all the controversy surrounding it.The fact is that this album really sucks and is a poor excuse to make money by poop diddy.There are only 5 good songs out of 26 total songs on the album.All the rest are only filler material.This rapper died because the rap world is full of criminals,materialism,greed and jealousy.This guy is no angel himself because he used to sell crack for his own materialistic ends and never really helped his own community when he could have.DO NOT BUY THIS SUCKY CD!!!
0767818040|4.0|A movie is an indulgence in voyeurism, so a movie about voyeurism is no stretch!  Actually it is very effective, as it pulls the viewer into the movie connecting with the voyeur and compels the viewer to feel as though they are part of the movie!<br />The tension is built up very effectively throughout the film, especially during one particular scene that I won't give away.  Let me just say it will have you on the edge of your seat, clenching whatever you can, completely engrossed in the action.<br />If this movie is a homage to Hitchcock, I think he'd be honored!

B00007BKVC|5.0|I first had the pleasure of seeing 'Thelma And Louise' at a friends sleep-over. We put it in the VCR, thinking it would be just an ordinary movie... How wrong we were!<br />This film is a classic and is made even better by the on screen presence of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. The story line is strong all the way through until the surprising finale. I had first had the video version of this movie, so no special features. Then I bought the Special Edition DVD and now I like the film even better!<br />There are many extras on the DVD, all of them top quality. My personal favourites include 'The Last Journey', a documentary about the making of the film, and the audio commentary from Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, and the writer Callie Khouri.<br />'Thelma And Louise' will always be popular as long as there are women on this earth.

Please buy it.<br />If you knew Hollywood (as David Lynch must) and had a nightmare about it which almost killed you (as David Lynch appears to have), this movie would be the result. But it's not an indulgent, surreal free-for-all--it's a compelling story, with some self-deprecating humor, some directorial satire. I think I even see a scene where he takes a perfect little potshot at Tarantino (wait for the closeup with that one tiny drop of blood).<br />My sister told me she thought she had it all figured out, until the last half hour when everything went to Hades. I bought it on that recommendation, and so should you.
B000002UUH|4.0|This has a nice variety of John Lennon's work.  Some of it is fair, some is good, some very good and a there are a few excellent items.  The incessant repeating in &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;Power to the People&quot; started to drive me up the wall very quickly.  These two protest songs are the worst two on the album.  It gets a lot better from there.  The upbeat &quot;Dear Yoko&quot; is fun to listen to, as is &quot;Happy Christmas&quot;.<BR>In the excellent category, I would have to include &quot;No 9 Dream&quot;, &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;(Just Like) Starting Over&quot;.  &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; is also quite a nice sounding song.  This album never really disappoints and if you don't like one particular song, you will like the next one.  There is something here for everyone.  A nice variety pack.  I don't know that I like anything here quite as much as some of the best songs that the Beatles did before they broke up and started solo careers.  The true test of musical genius is time.  Will these songs be played 50 or 100 years from now?  A couple of them might survive; most of them won't.  In fact as I write this review, I noticed that this item is not even currently available on Amazon.  That's a real shame since Lennon and McCartney had such a huge influence on pop and rock music.  The majority of the songs are still better than some of the trash being churned out these days and the album is a must to own if you don't already have any Lennon albums.
B000094DUP|5.0|All it took were a few mentions, and a couple of songs, and I knew I had to have this album. That was in March, and now, she is tied for one of my favorite artists. And I've never even seen her on TV or had to hear her on the radio. <br />Delta Goodrem is amazing. She has a great voice, plays the piano well, and, according to the many, *many* fans who have met her, is a very sweet person as well. <br />In 2002, the Australian soap &quot;Neighbours&quot; wanted a singer on the show...and it went uphill (and sky-high) from there. Her first single off this album, &quot;Born To Try&quot; reached #1 in Australia, and later made it to the top 5 in the UK. The second single &quot;Lost Without You&quot; repeated the successs. Delta was known for working overtime on promotion, traveling between the two countries, and visiting Europe in between. When she was at home, she did in-stores, where she gave autographs and talked to thousands of fans -- once for over seven hours. <br />Delta was going to work on releasing &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; in the US maybe this fall ('03), but as you may or may not have heard, she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in July. But that didn't put her career to a stop, since her fans have been, and will be, supporting her all the way. With her fourth single &quot;Not Me Not I&quot; which was released in September in Australia, she had a record (four number #1 singles from her debut album). <br />----<br />About this album:<br />Well, I wouldn't know how to describe it, but someone else would say &quot;piano-driven pop&quot;, which I don't think really does it justice. <br />There are the  ballads, like the powerful &quot;Born To Try&quot; and the sweet, simple &quot;Will You Fall For Me&quot; as the first and last tracks, respectively. <br />There's the autobiographical &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; in which she sings &quot;Do you remember...when you were seven, and the only thing you wanted to do was show your mum you could play the piano?&quot; ... &quot;Don't let me see mistakes and lies, let me keep my faith and innocent eyes...&quot;<br />On the track &quot;Predictable&quot;, Delta shows us that she can rock. This is especially cool to watch (or hear) her perform live (where she plays piano with her band). <br />----<br />If you want to know, my favorite tracks are &quot;Not Me Not I&quot; and &quot;Predictable&quot;, but I never skip a track when I'm listening. <br />--American Delta Fan (established March 11, 2003)
B00003RQNJ|5.0|this is just a fun movie to watch on a rainy after noon or something, watch some gun fights and bank robbing, some horses and old timey pictures and a young hot Robert Redford. If your thinking \\"she just likes reford\\" well my friend you are sadly mistaken for i genuinly loved this movie. the cinematography and the art dirction was great, the acting was top notch and revolved around characters you actually care about. Brilliant and one of the saddest endings ever
0385504209|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but I did not take it seriously.  The chapters are too short, and most of the book is just one breathtaking climactic leap to the next.  It's pretty easy to figure out who the real villain is after we meet him or her, and it's not that hard to understand why the ending is the way it is.  Do not pay full price for this book.  Borrow it. Buy it very cheaply--under $10.  Could I put the book down, yes.  Did I want the book to end. Yes.  Now the only question is....uhm...who are going to play the leads when  Hollywood gets hold of the rights--Anthony Hopkins is a shoe-in for sure!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Everytime Keanu came onto the screen I couldn't stop myself from remembering the SNL skit of him during one of their infamous Jeopardy game spoofs (I think he was portrayed by Toby McGuire) wagering &quot;eleventy billion dollars&quot;. This movie is horrible.
078881172X|4.0|My three and four-year-old nieces loved this movie.  It's never really been one of my favorites (mainly because Peter Pan annoys me to no end - like other reviewers I'd like to see Captain Hook get a good one in) but that's just my opinion.  (I didn't like the original book for the same reason.)  I liked it more when I was a kid.  I give it four stars for that reason.<br />This brings me to my question:  as a kid, I had both a 33 1/3 record with songs from Disney movies and a tall book based on the movie.  On the record, there was a song, &quot;Do You Believe in Fairies? (Then Clap Your Hands)&quot; which was played when Tinkerbell almost died.  In the book, Peter gets Wendy and all the children to clap their hands to bring Tinkerbell back to life.  I know I'm not dreaming this up - I still have both the record and the book.  <br />Both my sister (who's ten years older than I) and myself seem to remember that this was originally in the movie.  Can anyone shed some light on this for us?
B000002J6F|5.0|Ever since The Beatles released their groundbreaking 'White Album', the phenomenon of the double-LP has been an intriguing one.  Some of these productions are replete with long-winded instumental performances, such as The Allman Brother's 'Eat a Peach', or the best selling double-live of all time, 'Frampton Comes Alive'.  Others represent a true tour de force, such as The Rolling Stones' 'Exile On Main Street', or George Harrisons' 'All Things Must Pass'.  Stephen Stills 1972 double-LP, 'Manassas', joins the stellar company of the latter category.   <br />This masterpiece of composition and performance rests on the diversity of Stills' musical influences.  The album is loosely divided into 4 musical genres, yet the opening side, titled 'The Raven', ranges from hard rock to latin rock to powered blues to romantic ballad, and as such nearly defies being categorized.  The songs in 'The Raven' are presented as a suite, akin to the opening sides of The Beatles 'Abbey Road', or much of The Who's 'Tommy', and the quality of the music holds its own in comparison with these other, much heralded accomplishments.  <br />Side two is titled 'The Wilderness', and features a decided country atmosphere.  Side three is titled 'Consider', offering a bounty of gentle folk sounds with introspective, intimate lyrics.  Side four is titled 'Rock & Roll Is Here To Stay', and as such requires no deep description.  As Harrison would say, someone has given Stephen a wah-wah, and he hands it a grueling workout.<br />Each side of the album contains at least one song which would have to be considered a masterwork.  On side one, the plaintive ballad 'Both of Us (Bound To Lose)' does everything but cry for you.  On side two, perhaps the most alluring song Stills has ever recorded, 'So Begins the Task', finds center stage.  The soft melencholy strains of the acoustic and steel guitars, and the tear-laden lyrics of this song course through the air like the wings of an angel.  Side three opens with another plaintive folk song, originally written by Rick Roberts and Chris Hillman, but seriously overhauled by Stills, 'It Doesn't Matter'.  And side four features the epic rock song, 'The Treasure'.<br />Interspersed are numbers representing the best Stills has ever produced in any vernacular.  His hard rock leanings are indulged in 'Song of Love', 'Rock & Roll Crazies', 'Anyway', 'What To Do', and 'Right Now'.  His blues prowess is delivered in 'Jet Set' and 'Blues Man'.  Stills latino influences are given their due on 'Cuban Bluegrass', and he even offers an appealing, pioneering endeavor on the moog synthesizer in 'Move Around'.  His acoustic folk skills are displayed on 'Colorado', 'Fallen Eagle', 'Johnny's Garden', 'Jesus Gave Love Away For Free', and 'How Far'.  There is virtually no filler on either of these albums. <br />Stills supporting cast deserve much acclaim for the opus that is 'Manassas'.  Dallas Taylor (drums) and Calvin \\"Fuzzy\\" Samuels (bass) joined Stills in previous ventures with David Crosby and Graham Nash, and offer an able rhythm section.  The real standouts backing Stills, however, are Joe Lala laying down a latin-tinged beat through a variety of percussion instruments, and Al Perkins offering scintillating steel guitar solos and background for songs such as 'Hide It So Deep' and 'The Treasure'.  Chris Hillman rides along on rhythm guitar, and together with Perkins contributes haromonies that, at times, complement Stills gruff vocal delivery even better than Crosby or Nash ever did.<br />If there is to be a criticism of this production, it is that the performance of these songs, at times, feels a bit formulaic.  Stills is known to be a perfectionist, and in the recording studio this may lead to a stunted feeling that was overcome when the band performed live.  In 2000 Pioneer Artists released live studio performances by the band in their genesis.  This video, titled 'Live At Musikladen', reveals how much more heartfelt and personal some of these songs can become, especially offerings such as 'It Doesn't Matter', 'Hide It So Deep', and even 'The Treasure'.  Clearly, however, the complexity of mixing the stylings of a seven piece band and an occasional fiddler at times requires fiddling around a bit in the studio.<br />If you enjoy the more visible and  commercial work Stills has offered in the past, such as 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' and 'Love the One You're With', do yourself a favor: purchase this CD and savor the true depth and breadth of a modern day troubador.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Please. What on earth? Really sucks this movie, and the purpose of this film was .... what ??? If there is a purpose to this film, please tell me.
6302415993|1.0|After I watched the show on TV, I don´t even care what the other two reviewers said that the black guy wanted to shoot Jagger on stage and he was killed by the people who saw his act directly. My honest opinion is: I`D NEVER BEEN A STONES FAN. It is the fault of the band &amp; their security themselves, because they gave the concert in Altamont for free. As a result was: everybody from all villages came to see the band, they carried anything they wanted to bring; knives, bottles, haschisch, beers, dogs, children, guns what ever...without being checked seriously by the security. <br />I´d rather to see Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Purple or Black Sabbath shows.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce's album Dangerously in Love was good. I really liked the song Baby Boy featuring Sean Paul and Crazy In Love featuring Jay Z. Many people might say the other songs aren't good now jus because she hasn't made music videos for them. Many people say its not a good cd but yet lots of people are buying the cd.
B000089J0R|4.0|I know pretty few about them. They are English, that is all I can tell you. This album is actually pretty cool. Valley of the damned is their best song, it really rocks. Tha other songs are still good and some great, that really up to you to decide. It still cannot be compared to Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica or Stratovarius just to name some Symphonic power metal. But if you like these last, you will like Dragonforce.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I watched this in the theatres after my brother told me not to waste my money. I should have listened to him. In all honesty I can definitely put this in the top three worst Star Trek films; right down there with The Motion Picture and Star Trek V. I put a question mark because I'm not sure it's the worst, but based upon a simple test of which would I pick last to watch, it garners the worst rating. The sad thing is it managed to edge out Insurrection from the bottom three. I can't imagine that they'll make another Star Trek movie after two bombs in a row and the latest series reeling (which I've also stopped watching). Now you may think I'm not a Star Trek fan but my favorite episode aired the day I was born, I watched Star Trek in german without knowing the language when I was five, and I'm slowly buying up the DS9 seasons as I can afford them. I will never buy Nemesis. I have no desire to have it in my collection.
B00006AG5N|5.0|You know the ad campaign behind this album...&quot;Before Elvis There Was Nothing...Well it was never more apparent then after listening to this collection. Think about it Before Elvis there was &quot;race music&quot;. This was that sick notion by record company execs, who actually believed that blacks would only buy records recorded by fellow Afro-Americans and whites would only buy meonnaise and white bread. And the Asians and Hispainics really didn't fit anywhere into their insane plan.<br />Before Elvis there was this &quot;cardigan sweater&quot; image of what a pop singer was supposed to be. You remember &quot;Bing&quot;, with that menacing pipe smoking delinquent look. And then there was &quot;Frank&quot; donning that checkered hat and rain coat slung rebeliously over his shoulder. These were some scary cats. Hide the young ladies from these overtly sexy beasts.<br />And then there was Elvis....Well you know the rest. This collection burns red hot. I love it.

0345457684|2.0|Morgan's novice novel has a lot of excellent ideas with the rockets from the seediest hellholes on Earth, through virtual reality torture, into several gory firefights, and on to some exotic sexual escapades, however, the writing doesn't have the maturity that you expect for this kind of money.  Morgan succeeded with some of the essentials attempted, but others were full of potholes. It did become rather dull with some of the details, and needs to be more dedicated to the development of the overall story, then it would be an excellent work, but unfortunately, it doesn't have the maturity it should have.

B00004YZFR|3.0|before you believe any idiot that tells you the black guy was killed because 'racism', make sure you watch the film.<br />this guy goes straight up to the stage with a GUN pointed at mick jagger, probably less than 10 feet from him. the Hell's Angels rightfully grab him and one wrongfully stabs him. this has nothing to do with his race. this was stopping an attempted murder of the leader of the Rollings Stones.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|A classic concert film set on the backdrop of an ampitheatre in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, until recently it was only available on VHS. Now, the film has recieved the DVD update and I'm quite pleased with it.<br />An assortment of earlier Pink Floyd songs are played by the band, including \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\", \\"One Of These Days\\" and \\"Echoes\\". While I am disappointed that the audio is only stereo, it sounds better than it ever did on VHS.<br />The film itself is rather interesting, mixing footage of planets and other space exploration with shots of the band and the destroyed city of Pompeii. The footage of Pompeii is best used during the beginning of \\"Echoes, Part 2\\".<br />Overall, it is a decent upgrade of the original film, featuring just enough new stuff to warrant a re-release. A great insight into Pink Floyd just before they hit their peak, and for a good price too!

B00003CXB4|5.0|I give the film 5 stars but I've got to say I was really  disappointed  in the &quot;new&quot; musical number.  I've had misgivings from when I first heard about it, but was willing to give it a chance.  Since I knew the number from the broadway show I knew that it would somehow have to replace certain moments from the original film. I think the song works fine in the stage version, but I worried that it would break up the original flow of the <BR>scene.  And I was right.  I'm sorry, but I really like when Mufasa tells Zazu that he's giving a pouncing lesson and tells him to turn around, and then the next time Zazu looks behind him, the two lions have vanished.  In the &quot;Special Edition&quot; that little moment is gone.  Still I might have overlooked this if the filmmakers had not done the unforgivable:  hired another actor to do a Rowan Atkinson impersonation! As far as I know  Mr. Atkinson is the only voice actor (other than Jeremy Irons) who has never reprised his role from LION KING.  I kind of understand where it might be due to budget constraints on some of the other projects, but to create inconsistencies in the original film ...?! <BR> I kind of had a feeling it would happen.  Good ol' predictable Disney ....  <BR>Thank God the original version is on the disc as well!
0679601686|5.0|this is definately an amazing piece of literature.  i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come.  i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book.  what more needs to be said...it is my favorite book..EVER! i place it above the rest, and truly believe there is no comparison.  the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes.  Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text.  no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself.
B00005JM93|1.0|I love movies and almost never hate one.  I hated this movie.  The camerawork at the start of the movie almost gave me motion sickness.  The story was violent and boring at the same time- not an easy feat.  I truly cannot understand the good reviews it received.
B00005JLPK|4.0|The color choices for movie sets and costumes in this movie are very artistic using mostly primary colors. Weaving all this together with well chosen mexican music makes this movie a refreshing change from the usual studio movie. The scenery is sumptuous and Fridas passion for art is very evident. There isn't much of a story, just the biography of Frida and her art and how it interwines with the relationship she has with mural artist Diego Rivera. Nevertheless, I liked the movie.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Allow me to be somewhat of a voice of reason here.  The Matrix Reloaded was not the new age drek loaded, garritous, messiah wannabe that most people try to make it out to be.  Nor is it the best film ever to be released.  It is instead a innovative, daring, well thought out, and somewhat to contrived for its own good piece of filmmaking that entertains more then most holloywood inspired tripe.  <br />First of all, the films greatest weakness is that alot of its story is so intricate, that it couldnt fit into a film.  Instead the Witchowski brothers wrote some of its backstory into &quot;Final Flight of the Osirus&quot;; a animated short from animatrix, and the rest of its backstory can be found in the video game; &quot;Enter the matrix&quot; which explaines what happens to some of the more underexplored characters and thier origins.  As much as I appreciate new methods of storytelling, it would have been a bit more considerate for the mainstream crowd just to put in what would equivilate to the matrix equvelant of crib notes, to those that dont want to get to involved in the mythology.  <br />Also, this film is defintately daring in the sense that it attempts some different imagery and story telling factors that are rare to hollywood.  It was interesting to see Zion, and its myraid levels of population and how they relate, But the &quot;Prayer&quot; and subsequent Rave that followed was no doubt meant to make us respect the peoples heart and willingness to celebrate in the face of doom, instead... it came off as campy and somewhat garritous.<br />My final complaint is that as a Art/history major, I am familiar with Shakesphere, Locke, Hobbs, Dostiovski, Nietche, and other Rennaisance writers.  So I was able to pick up the references, and characters that are obviously meant to represent the ideals and flaws behind the Philosophies of These writers.  However, for a average movie goer, I feel somewhat sorry for, since they will have a tougher time appreciating the thoughts and ideas the directors are attempting to get across.   The Witchowski Brothers seem to have a fascination with the Rennaisance Period in history, which is supported by the fact that the story in Animatrix that Details how the machines were created, persecuted, and eventually defeated humanity is entitled, &quot;The Second Rennaisance.&quot;<br />Now that Ive Pointed out the movies flaws, allow me to rant a little on what is good about &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;  The story, while yes contrived and a bit convoluted, is very original.  Those that attempt to discern where the plot will unravel will likely be very surprised.  Its very amusing to see how much thought the Witchowski's have put into the saga of the matrix.  Neo is now neigh invincible in combat, but is still fallable by human weaknesses.  Meanwhile its good to see that Supporting characters such as Morpheus and trinity are still capable of fending for themselves whenever Neo is not around.  Each of the returning good guys shall grow and develop in surpring and plasing ways.<br />But it is the Villans in this film that steal the show. Magnovinion, while annoying, is rather intriguing as a villan.  Persephone is as mysterious as she is seductive.  The archetect is cold and ruthless, a master manipulator.  Last but certainly never least, is probably one of the coolest villans in cinema history; Agent Smith.  Smith has returned and is now deadlier then ever.  More of a virus then a program now, he is clever with the insults, and definately worthy of further screen time.  <br />The Matrix relaoded is not the kind of film that comes out every day.  Its story is steeped more in humanities history then it is in the future, but at the same time, is also steeped heavily in myth and fantasy.  The action scenes this time around are original, and garritous, but amusing.  Your jaw will drop during the Burly Brawl, and the highway chase is a scene that has now set the standard for car chases and fight scenes atop moving vehicles.  Though the film is flawed in some respects, the flaws come with the Witchowski brothers sometimes trying to be a bit too over the top, and attempting different tricks that just dont work.  But nonetheless, it is indeed a worthy addition to your DVD collection, the Xtras promise to pump up the value of this already great film.  Next month, Revolutions shall debut, and end off the saga of the matrix.  So the Timing is perfect for the release of this DVD.
B00005A46T|1.0|Iv been listening to metal for years. this isnt metal. this album espically isnt. Slipknot is so far from metal its embarrising. thier nothing but noisy POP music. they think thirt heavy with their cute little two drummer idea, well iv got bands that have one drummer who sounds like three. i see a lot of people with slipknot shirts and all i instantly think poser! but who am i to judge i dont know their home life. i dont know what else they listen to. but if thier listeing to slipknot their not metal heads. If you think slipknot is metal you are nothing more than wussy mainstream pop teenie bopper, who probably only heres music off his car radio. Get away from the dial, there is so much out thier than will blow these clows and i do mean CLOWNS away. you want heavy without the stupid guy yelling and singing all perty. then iv got you a list. and they are geranteed metal. You want heavy peircing, you listen to Strapping Young Lad, you want evil and speed you listen to Children of Bodom, you want chaos you listen Vader, or At THE GATE§, and if you want thrash with a clear voice who truly truly knows how to sing listen to Dream Evil. there ya go. remember im not trying to piss anybody off. and also im not one of those &quot;i had to give it a one, because they dont have zero&quot; kinda guys. this album does deserve a full star. but its just noisy pop no nuthin to it. gets old around track 2. and the opening sounds like there all in the same stall constapated. <br />p.s. if you stay a fan of slipknot and you still need more heavy, i recomend six feet under. there heavier, and they have an extreme pop metal sound. a lot like these guys but these guys dont deserve the metal part, just the pop part.
B00005JLZN|1.0|Death penalty opponent David Gale (Kevin Spacey), himself imprisoned on Death Row for the murder of a fellow activist (Laura Linney), tells his story to a newspaper reporter (Kate Winslet) supposedly so that she can clear his name.  This well-made film with its excellent cast starts out well but soon becomes implausible and silly.  It may appear to be anti-death penalty propaganda, but the illogical surprise resolution of the story reveals it to be completely ambivalent.  While masquerading as a serious film, it is actually an overwritten mystery with a dunderhead plot that portrays those on both sides of the issues as fools or worse--gun-toting good ol' boys on one side and dishonest crazies on the other.  If it doesn't offend you regarding your position on the death penalty, it should offend you as a lover of good movies.
0140271791|4.0|I'm a huge fan of this book.  It's my favorite of all the Keyes books.  It's funny, serious, and heart warming.  READ THIS BOOK!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|What is funny about these types of bands is their ability to make you believe that they are actually good. Unfortunately a song like &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; is a complete abomination of rock n roll.  Its trite, talentless, and style over substance. For those of you buying into this cheese, chances are you shouldn't of been born in the first place. You don't have to listen to it just because its new. This band is basically ripping off bands that got their formula from ripping off bands from the 60's and 70's.  This is music made for the background of commercials and late night MTV2.  This is a product, not music.
0767827716|3.0|It's an impossible task: how do you make a movie about a demonic car scary?  The answer, apparently, is: you don't.  There is not one single scare in this entire movie, nor are there any particular chills.  There are a couple of chase scenes that exude a momentary sense of apprehension, but as horror movies go, this is not one for the ages.<br />That's not to say it's a bad movie, though.  It isn't.  Just not a scary one.  The acting is fairly good; the score (composed of typically nice, if spare, Carpenter synth work and of rock songs) is effective; the cinematography is consistently outstanding; and the special effects are top-notch, way WAY better than anything that would be done via CGI today.<br />The main problem with the movie, really, is that it's a movie about a haunted (or possessed, or something) car, in which we find out very little about why the car is evil.  Okay, fine.  Instead, the movie tries to be sort of a metaphor for the difficulty of being a high school outcast, and for the dangers of obsession.  The movie fails at these objectives, as well.  There is very little dramatic cohesion at work; by the end of the movie, you just don't much care about anyone in it.  Every time I see it, I'm left wishing that there had been a lot more murderous-car-crushing-the-unjust action.  Goodness knows, there isn't much else to enjoy.<br />I'm not trashing the movie, though.  There are individual scenes that are very good, and that makes the movie worth seeing.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Hey, all in all I really dug this sucker! I thought the fights went form brutal,(in The Matrix), to poetic in The Matrix Reloaded.<BR>Okay...I  too scratched my head at some of the dialoge in the second Matrix film, but that's exactly what it is: The middle movie in a serires concieved as a trilogy. I knew this going into the movie, and I came away fairly confident that any remaining,(and new), questions I had would be answered in The Matrix: Revolutions, or a repeat viewing of the first film.<br />Current cinema is being reinvented by young filmmakers who take chances, and follow thier vision. Sometimes that requires an extremely short attention span, and other times these pioneers are challenging your patience &amp; viewpoint. I felt that &quot;Reloaded&quot; was asking me to &quot;hang in there&quot;, and to re-examine why the hell I liked The Matrix in the first place. That is exactly what I did. (Surely that makes me a nerd to the tenth power!) <BR>Today's movies have sub-plots being planted early on, only to slap you in the face once you've forgotten about them, not to mention the fact that movie audiences now require something that is complex yet simple enough not to short-circuit thier brains. That's a fine line. It's like trying to explain a car's powertrain to a child...You don't start out telling them about the whole combustion process, the gear ratios &amp; the transmission...you just tell the kid to step on the pedal and the car goes...And, as they get older..you start to get more &amp; more detailed. Isn't that what's happennig in these pre-concieved trilogy movies?<BR>Hmmm, yeah... So cool it, kick back, and let the whole story unfold. Besides, the directors have sprinkled Reloaded with just enough eye-candy &amp; surprizes to reel us back in for Revolutions,(whether we want to be there or not.) <BR> I love that! <BR>Anyhow, as far as a dvd goes... I am super excited about the Reloaded extras. Most of all though, I am eagerly awaiting repeated viewings of this movie. I will admit that The Matrix &quot;world&quot; might take itself a little bit too seriously. In fact, one of the most &quot;serious&quot; scenes takes place between Neo &amp; the architect, and I have read over &amp; over again how people despise this part of the movie. (It's my favorite!) All it proves is that many of the moviegoers were expecting more answers, not more questions. Still, I wonder just how important all the new techno-babble &amp; philosophy raised in Reloaded really are. Maybe this is a diversion to a much simpler plot. Then again, maybe the Wachowskis just had too much money and time to indulge their bloated vision. Only the individual viewer can decide, and I already have...<br />I was notified of this disc's release by THEDIGITALBITS.COM
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This was a pretty bad movie. It might be good if I had never seen the first one, but this was just a bad movie. I just don't get how it sucked so much. It wasn't even worth watching. This movie was overrated. Same with the videogame &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. Enter the Matrix exits the Matrix and Reloaded is unloaded. Both were horrible. I'm anxiously awaiting the third one hoping it will make this one better, but I kind of doubt it. I think it was the abrupt ending that ruined it most. If you haven't seen this movie wait until November around the time the third movie comes out to watch this one. THen it might not seem so bad, but I'm not sure.
B00004T9UF|5.0|wow... i got this cd back on the first day it came out... its still a cd i listen to on a regular basis. yo DAVID im 15 my mom likes eminem ... i still listen to him. but i can agree eminem gets to overplayed on mtv thats the reason for most his friends. i bet you never heard eminem's nail in the coffin, the sauce, quitter, hit em up (d12 remix) invasion, conspiracy, hail mary 2003, bump heads. i could go on for ever. this cd came closest to all of those tracks. eminem isnt to different from your black rapper except for his commercial songs. this is eminem's best album. the best songs are criminal, stan, amityville, b!tch please 2, and drug ballad. I highly recommend you buy this cd and also look for any nyc mixtapes with the name DJ Green Lanturn on it (thats eminem's dj), thats where he shows his more &quot;gangsta&quot; side. Im Out Pcze - Joe
B00009V7RF|1.0|Ok, first off, i have heard the entire album(borrowed it off sister) and i have to say that was one awful album. I hear alot of people are going nuts over the song &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; and it is certainly the most overated rap song of the year(if you can even call this a rap song). You see when mtv viewers and pop station listners hear this song they think wow that song has some great songwriting, but you see the truth is, this song has terrible songwriting, its just the wonderful message that hides the poor songwriting, oh and please, don't think they are such a nice band just because that song has a nice message, they just made a song with a nice message just to get overplayed on mtv and pop stations like that they could make money, but wait how should i know they did that song for the money!!! Oh yeah they did a song called &quot;Lets Get Retarded&quot; which proves they don't care for about people with disabilities. All in all i say stick away from these sick minded money scammers.<br />Need a rap album??? I say get a Tupac or Cypress Hill album, atleast they don't do music for the money and atleast they don't make fun of people with dissabilities.
B00006LJ72|5.0|This is a great collection of Enya's music. 50 songs and a video, with beautiful photography, lyrics, and nice notes on the music. It's great for all fans of Enya, from the newbies to the hardcore. I'm actually listening to Disc 4 now as I type this, the soothing vocals and music are great for relaxing or just about anything. My only problem is that they could have added some more songs (Aniron from the Lord of the Rings soundtrack comes to mind)but I don't really have that much of a problem with it. Blissful and enjoyable, this is a wonderful set.

B00000F14B|5.0|This is a beautiful film! It's hilarious, can be enjoyed by a variety of ages, has a delightful story-line, and the music is kick-uh... butt! ^_^;;; Robert Preston is one of the best actors you'll see on DVD and this is him at his finest. Enjoy a classic that can be watched over and over without ever growing bored.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Do you remember \\"Ghost\\" with Demi Moore? I have a sneaking suspicion that that was an ultra-Hollywood version of this movie, and yet this 1989 wonder from Spielberg is such magic on film that I bet it'll enter your list of personal favorites on the very first viewing.<br />The very moving theme revolves around Dreyfuss' character who has a hard time letting go of his significant other, played by the irridiscent Holly Hunter. Above all, what'll linger in your mind is an exquisite bittersweet bond of tenderness and sexual tension between Dreyfuss and Hunter, one that parallels Goodbye Girl. Such maturity and understanding is very rare in your average Hollywood fare. With the immaculate cinematography and background score, at times you can feel what their characters were feeling.<br />And yet, the movie manages to be pretty funny, not your \\"American Pie\\" kind of schtick but an intelligent witty kind of humour. Plus there's a bit of thrilling action too, especially towards the end.<br />Of love, passion, friendships, letting go -- without giving any further away, this is a delectable family movie that you can (and probably will) see again and again.

B0000B3FCX|5.0|This album is Great. I have all four of there albums, I'm a huge fan of there's. I don't know if anyone cares or not but I bought this album the first day it was released at a local Wal-Mart.  It came with a cd key code to download a bonus track off of Wal-Mart.com the bonus track was an Acoustic version of the song &quot;Someday&quot;

0380729407|5.0|Perhaps I am a bit biased, but I just can't say anything bad about Ray Bradbury.  I have read the reviews of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" both positive and negative.  I agree with both sides to an extent.  \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" IS a dated novel.  And while dialogue at times seems straight from \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" (Gee whiz!) and the ending can be deemed corny, I feel that this book and Ray Bradbury have stood and will continue to stand the test of time.<br /><br />Bradbury's style of writing may not be appreciated by everyone, but to say that his work is a waste of time seems way to extreme to me.  I love Bradbury's works FOR the metaphors, FOR his long descriptions.  Bradbury does not allow his readers to be innocent bystanders, instead he places them right there standing next to Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, witnessing firsthand the evil that is Dark and Cooger's traveling carnival.  It is a perfect combination of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.  For this, Ray Bradbury is definitely one of a kind.<br /><br />As for the ending, I was happy to read a novel with such a simple message at the end.  There was no big complex (often ridiculously impossible) solution to ridding the town of evil, rather a pure, simple fix.  For me, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a welcomed stray from modern horror fiction.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I enjoyed all of the extra's.some folks who don't know much about Rap&Hip-Hop Culture don't understand how this Film Influenced so many but I'll tell you why:Al Pacino's Role related to the Hood in so many ways.He was Portraying a Miniority in this Country trying to get His Hustle on for His Papers.this Film talked directly to me back in 83&He didn't back down from nobody&wanted His Voice to Be heard.the truth of the Matter without the Rap/Hip-Hop Community this Classic wouldn't be getting half the Love it gets now.so Many Great Quotes Here&if you are about doing your thing then you can Relate to TOny Montana.Oliver Stone made my day saying He got the Name from San Francisco 49er Great Joe Montana.that is Classic.I enjoyed the whole expierence uncut.IMHO this was Al Pacino's Last Knock Out ROle.He has Good Roles since but not One where You would quote Half the Film Over&over again.I can watch this Movie anytime.
B00005JKZV|5.0|How exciting that a film like this is doing so well! An utterly fabulous story, brilliant cinematography and special effects, exceptionally good acting - and a film that can be seen with equal enjoyment by children as well as by teenagers and by parents. It is also a thoroughly morally uplifting tale, the triumph of good over evil - just the kind of thing that we in the USA and Britain need to see at this moment in our history. Buy it, enjoy it and give it to all your friends for Christmas! Christopher Catherwood (from 2 of Tolkien's old Universities), and author of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)
B0000AXE8I|5.0|First off, I would like to point out that the 1st Matrix involed all philosophy.  However, the 2nd Matrix involves all action scenes and very little philosophy.  In other words, the people who rate The Matrix: Reloaded high love action movies, but the people who rate it poorly love a good philosophical movie.  So what kind of a movie do you like?  If you love a great action movie-than this is your movie, but if you don't, well, you will probably not like this movie since it contains only a couple of philosophical ideas.  Another thing, The Matrix: Revolutions should have a variety of both which would make it the best overall of the series, but to understand Revolutions you must first understand Reloaded!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|This DVD is absolutely wonderful!  The music is varied and well-played.  Ive seen Andre &amp; Company in concert and this DVD is almost as good as being there. The &quot;chapter&quot; of the Andre Sisters is a classic. The quality of the DVD is amazing.  I play it frequently and I am charmed all over again by these very talented and lively musicians.  The ladies colorful gowns are a welcome change from the plain black gowns that most female classical musicians wear. Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra  are proof that classical musicians dont have to be stodgy and solemn.
B000002HJD|5.0|I really like this disc. I don't think Morrison was the world's greatest poet, but he was talented. If all cd's are going to be rejected because they're not wholly successful, why bother with art? This recording gives us the best of two worlds that aren't combined much; atmospheric music that rocks, and is by turns jazzy and even latin-tinged. Then there are Jim's words, which in my opinion are superior in a spoken-word album context. In this recording they went for it and gave us something in spoken word besides guns, bling-bling, and other juvenile rap garbage.
B000000HSU|4.0|Lets get one thing straight.  The Bad Brains are, first and foremost, a punk band.  They were NOT, and I cannot overstate this, influenced by reggae from the start.  They were made up of HR brain, Earl Hudson, Darryl Cyanide, and Dr. Know.  they started in 1979ish in Washington D.C. from the ashes of a jazz/fusion band called Mindpower.  They discovered the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, and the Dead Boys.  And they discovered Positive Mental Attitude (PMA for short) through the works of Napolean Hill, author of &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; and &quot;Success through a Positive Mental Attitude.&quot;  This changed their world, and started this band to get people to see PMA.  They wanted to help people, which is what punk is really all about.  While they were not the VERY first hardcore punk band (Black Flag in LA was just getting started) they were one of the first.  They influenced hundreds of punks over there, including Ian McKaye (later of the Slinkees, Teen Idles and Minor Threat) and Henry Garfield (better known as Henry Rollins, later of S.O.A. and Black Flag), and changed the scene, which had been led by the capable Slickee Boys, the incredibly untamed White Boy, the artsy Urban Verbs, and the melodic Half Japanese  (these were good bands but Bad Brains was something special).  One fine day, however, HR grew very very sick with pneumonia.  He picked up a bible and started praying.  This reminded him of when he and the rest of Mindpower had seen a show, with Bob Marley.  He remembered being very impressed with reggae, Rastafarianism, and Marley himself.  In the end, he adopted Rastafarianism, made Marley his idol, became homophobic (which is VERY much against the punk ethic), cried out for the destruction of Babylon, and pushed Bad Brains to playing reggae.  (HR was never one to do things halfway).  While the rest of the band accepted Rastafarianism, Dr. Know and Earl were opposed to playing reggae.  So one can pretty much divide up this album into 3 parts.  Their real punk PMA songs, which include: Attitude, Right Brigade, Banned in D.C. (my fav), the ultimate PMA song Supertouch, Sailin' On, At the Movies, Riot Squad, and How Low Can a Punk Get?  Buy Rock for Light for these songs.  There are then the Rasta but still punk songs: Big Takeover, Joshua's Song, Destroy Babylon, F.V.K., I, Coptic Times, Rock for Light, and We Will Not.  Some of these are quite good (see We Will Not and F.V.K.), but for the music alone, not the lyrics which are very religious, and I being an (informed!) atheist do not like this.  It also took away the message of PMA from their songs, which I believe to be really what the world needs right now.  I dislike these songs for this reason.  Then there are the few reggae songs, which include I and I survive (which actually has a very punk message, if it weren't for the Rasta part), The Meek, Rally Round Jah Throne, and Jam.  Now I am not against reggae, but I think that it is a shame that this took away from the Bad Brains initial message of PMA and love and unity.  So embrace the PMA songs on this album.  This is why you should buy it.  In a world that has serious problems, and people being spoon-fed music through the horrible Mtv, we need the concepts of PMA now more than ever.  (Pick up Napolean Hill's books for more on this).
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Pulp Fiction meets the Shaw Brothers and the Shogun Assassin.  What kind of tunes are you gonna get with that trio?  However, the music does match very well to the movie.  Nancy Sinatra's song, &quot;Bang Bang&quot; is used almost as a narrative to the opening.<br />What makes the soundtrack for me are two tracks.  Hotei Tomoyasu &quot;Battle without Honor or Humility&quot;.  This is the music played on the trailer.  In the movie, it has been given special treatment.  The track is played during a Reservoir Dogs like slo-mo walk which only adds coolness with cool.<br />However, for something super special that cannot be found anywhere, except here, is Super 16's &quot;NEU!&quot;.  Although it was hardly played in the movie, I am so overjoyed that it was included in the soundtrack.  This song was the original theme music for &quot;Master of the Flying Guilliotine&quot;.  Whenever, the Master was on screen, this music was heard.  It is so classic and super super cool.
B00004HYLF|5.0|I first heard most of this album for the first time live on a U.K. music show way back in 197...something or other!  It blew my brain out then and still does, I bought the old vinyl version and I thought it would not be as good as the live show I had heard originally... how wrong I was!  It is still great even now, way ahead of its time.  When you listen as a whole it is amazing, but sit back and pick an instrument line and then listen....you will be saying...huh?  he can't play that like that, there!  oh er yeah he just did!  fusion is not the word for it!  its something else.  but as all this is going on there is a steady musical theme and all is under control.  Go and buy this and you will not be bored.  I could go on and on about each individuals playing but I could not do them justice, just buy it!
0790729393|4.0|Good movie. While the exact story is not true, or, we would have seen the real story on American Justice, can anyone say that the events never took place in some form in this world?
B00005JLSE|5.0|The best movie made in many years.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  Right after seeing the movie we purchased the CD.
B00005M989|5.0|OK. Here is the bottom line. If you have the music that is contained in this album, then THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR YOU! So, to everyone else, purchase The Very Best of Prince if you do not have any other collection by Prince and you wish to sample songs from popular albums like, 1999, Purple Rain, Paisley Park, Sign O The Times, etc... It is &quot;inexpensive&quot; and it gives a &quot;general taste&quot; of his popular work.  <br />Yes, it is true that Prince has many, many outstanding songs and albums. (I even own original 12&quot; extended singles and European releases that were never available in America. Have you heard music from Prince's &quot;Black&quot; album?) <br />The Very Best of Prince is obviously geared towards that individual who has never listened to Prince on the radio or has collected none of his music. (Probably for the younger generations of people and those who wish to expand their horizons from other musical catagories such as country, jazz, classical, etc...)<br />Obviously, if you know Prince then you know his music. You will also know that his style changes from album to album. (Therefore, everyone has a different favorite album. Your's may be Purple Rain, Around The World In A Day, or Graffiti Bridge but my favorite could be Parade, LoveSexy,or Batman - Soundtrack.) <br />Advice to those with curiosity...  Purchase this album if want to explore Prince with a few BASIC songs from his most popular work. If you are a more advid listener with a knowlegde of Prince's music and you want hard to find songs, like Erotic City and 200 Balloons, then purchase The Hits/The B-Sides and if you want to own a collection of all of the popular radio and bar tunes that you have heard, like Raspberry Beret, Pop Life, or Sexy MF, then go for just The Hits 1 &amp; 2.<br />Most people who like Prince will have his music somewhere in their collection. Therefore, I say again, THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR YOU! (But, don't let me stop you from spending your money or adding toyour Prince collection. By the way, Money Don't Matter 2 Night can be found on what other album?) If you don't have it, then buy The Very Best of Prince. (Everybody buys an entire album for just one song, don't they? I have!)<br />Five stars are given because...   (read paragraphs one and three.)
B0000AM6LY|5.0|Absolutely awesome. I bought the CD a few months before it was even released in the states and I can't stop listening to it. I just can't imagine why Mick &amp; Band haven't had as much success here as they have in Europe, but it's a shame. Hucknall is a master of  songwriting, has a brilliant voice and deserves a great deal more attention. (Yes, there are quite a few covers on this album, but they still have a very unique flavor!) Every track on &quot;Home&quot; is gorgeous and the variety of songs is perfect. &quot;Sunrise&quot; is definitely a favorite, as is &quot;Fake.&quot; I was a little surprised to hear &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;-but Mick pulled it off charmingly. A definite must for any SR fan or any nostalgic soul who hasn't listened in for a while.
0345457684|1.0|I thought this was really very average. A few elements from Strange Days mixed with Michael Marshall Smith's Spares. Nothing original here. Not even well witten.
B000092ZYX|1.0|ok, radiohead has got to be the worst band i have ever heard in my life.First of all, the lead singer looks like a crackhead in everyone of his performances, his head just rolls side to side whenever he so called ''sings''. you want good music, pink floyd the wall, metallicas master of puppets, led zeppelins house of the holy, guns n roses appetite for destruction,queens news of the world,van halens 1984,ac/dc's back in black,but DEFINITLY not radiohead. damn.
B00003CXB4|2.0|Disney's Lion King was a great film before it came to DVD, especially with songs by Elton John.  Now, for some reason, Elton John is not singing in this DVD release of the movie, it is some woman.  I did not pay for this DVD to hear some woman sing.  She ruined the movie for me.  It's bad, trust me.
6303471714|5.0|Despite the negative editorial review, this tape rocks! I bought this tape back in 1992, and recently rebought it to get back in shape after having a baby. If you do 1 workout a day for 2 weeks you will notice a huge difference. As a former gymnast and dancer, I can say that her workouts are excellent. As for those that claim they &quot;threw out their backs&quot;, if you're completely out of shape, well what do you expect? And she never extends her knee over her foot, she makes a point to tell you NOT to do that. Disregard the poor editorial review!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot are actually a very cool band. People think that they are a worthless, pointless pile of crap, but I disagree. Although they are not the best instrumentalists ever, the riffs are good 'n' heavy. Corey Taylor, the vocalist, has a nice voice in general, but when he gets hardcore, it sounds like someone is clutching his nads with a vice. All that aside, I'd like to imagine a Slipknot mask kit, lciensed by Corey and by Roadrunner records. So if this doesn't seem too hardcore for you, check it out.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This sounds like The Rolling Stones more than Mick 'n' Keef ever did. Imagine Oasis with a fixation for the Glimmer Twins instead of that for the Liverpool chaps. While in \\"Get What You Need\\" you have a song with a riff worth of inclusion in Let It Bleed or Beggar's Banquet, \\"Move On\\" is the way the Aussies play \\"Wild Horses\\". \\"Look What You've Done\\" could be a lost song from the White Album sessions. \\"Lazy Gun\\" is the glam sound of T.Rex paired with John Lennon's dreams of diamond studded skies. Great stuff. Oh, and they look cool too.
B00005JMEW|4.0|For anyone who wants to question this movies violence or action , all I have to say is do your research. Quentin Tarantino, takes notes, and good ones, some of the best movies. This film has a dreamlike quality, with an amazing soundtrack to boot. <br />It's very rare to see a film that has the ability to carry a plot, so character driven, and balance it with action. The storyline is one that is relatively new amidst the constant parade of romantic comedies and action pics that all seem to star the same people, as well as characters.
B00005JKN9|1.0|No plot; overdone in all respects; poorly cast; ahistorical; rediculous survivals; but most of all utterly pointless.  A waste of a precious evening.

0385504209|5.0|I read a brief excerpt from this book on a book site and it seemed slow and plodding, so didn't follow up and order it.  A friend recommended I give it another try and I am so glad I did.  This is a fascinating read - full of historical detail concerning Christianity and the Catholic Church.  I loved the explanations behind Da Vinci's religious paintings and the information concerning the Knights of Templar and Priory of Sion and their connection to the Holy Grail.  We have been passing this book around in my family and it's motivated some really interesting topics of discussion.
0783231202|2.0|This movie could be really good if it focused on the Middle Passage. The brief segement on the slave ship was by far the best sequence in the film. But the rest of the movie is dull, sappy, and overblown.<br />Also, its not very historically accurate. This is not a problem dramatically (&quot;Nixon&quot; for example:great drama, horrible history), but its a personal pet peeve of mine. Also, as a history teacher, I find it disturbing that teachers were encouraged to use the film for educational purposes when it was released.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is SUCH a good example of Enya's music. My favorite tracks are:<BR>A day without Rain(****)A beautiful piano instrumental.<BR>Wild Child(*****)This is such a fun song! It reminds me of a hyper little 'wild child'.<BR>Only time(*****)Upbeat new age style. One of the best. Great lyrics.<BR>Flora's Secret(****)A fun song! Slightly strange lyrics.<BR>Fallen Embers(*****)A touching, emotional song. One of the best.<BR>Silver Inches(****)A wonderful instrumental. Really cool.<BR>Lazy Days(****)Great beat! But again, weird lyrics.<BR>The other songs are good too, but not the best. This is SUCH a good album! you will not regret buying this!
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is superb! Not only does it have an excellent story line, but the theory and facts were so interesting I was compelled to do more research upon completion of the the book. It was so good that my boyfriend and I almost got into an argument overview who was going to read the book, while reading the same book at the same time. Overall, it was an excellent and informative book that challenges some of the principles of Christianity. If you are a person who seeks unconventional thought and information, this book is a must read!
B00003CXV4|5.0|A compelling love story about how opposites attract.  When Nelson(Keanu Reeves) and Sara (Charlize Theron) meet in this movie it is not love at first sight, but as the story progresses they begin to fall in love and soon Keanu finds out that she has cancer. This story is a tearjerker and is a must see movie!!
B00005JLTN|5.0|I loved the movie for its special effects and action.Though the &quot;The Matrix&quot; had a much better story.In matrix reloaded there is a lot of scenes which were not necessary,like the dance scene in Zion.But the movie is filled with lot of action and high quality special effects.People who love action will love this movie.Do not hesitate to buy this movie.<br />To understand MATRIX i recommend you'll have to see Animatrix which explains how the matrix became.

0684857219|4.0|I bought two books: \\"Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding\\" by Gerard Thorne and Phil Embleton (made from magazine Musclemag's articles), and \\"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding\\" by Arnold Schwartzenegger. I read both books very thoroughly. They are both very informative and good for bodybuilding practicioner. I guess it would be interesting to compare these two.    The books are full of pictures and poses, far more than necessary.    Arnold's book seems to be the honest opinion of generally the most famous living bodybuilder in the world nowadays. In the book all exercises are explained; photographs are not put just for Arnold's fame but also they exactly explain what the author said, much better then Musclemag's photographs; the book is more of narrow scope when compared to Musclemag's; it has less scientific approach than Musclemag's but is more practical; it lacks the completeness of Musclemag's in food and other compartments, but is not boring. Actualy Arnold says the same things as Muslcemag's book.    Musclemag's book is more like real encyclopedia, with a lot of diverse articles covering every possible aspect of bodybuilding; If you would like to read about everything in bodybuilding this is the book for you; the book lacks some consistency because it is compiled from different articles published through a long time period; in that book you will find some exercises explained and some which are not explained at all, what makes the book much more suitable for advanced bodybuilder than for a beginner; the strongest aspect of the book is the bodybuilding practice of the greatest bodybuilders in the world, explaining their principles and routines which is invaluable for advanced bodybuilders but can be interesting (or missleading) for beginners; the photographs are mostly boring because there are too many of them which do not illustrate too well what the author said.  -----------------------------------------------------------  After some time and after a lot more experience I should like to pay your attention on the book \\"Essentials of weightlifting & Strength\\" by Mohamed El-Hewie. I think this book is MUCH BETTER than the two books mentioned above. The point is: Mr El-Hewie will teach you the whole art of weightlifting and not only the bodybuilding, which is only a small part of it. Moreover if you train bodybuilding you are going into trouble with injuries and deformities! So Mr. El-Hewie?s book would keep you safe from such nasty destiny and gives you a complete new world of satisfaction with your training (talking from my personal experience!).    Wish you all fun in your training and life!     solair.eunet.yu/~slavne
B0000AUHOH|3.0|It's so popular to hate The Final Frontier that it's become a cliche.  But I say this hatred is largely unfounded.  This movie has many of the elements that make Star Trek great: an epic story, action and suspense, a search for the unknown, and most importantly, exploration of the bonds of friendship.  <br />There are plot holes.  There are parts that are downright unbelievable.  And there are parts that make no sense whatsoever, even in the context of the Star Trek universe (for one thing, the center of the galaxy is supposed to be thousands of light years away in the Next Generation and Voyager - a journey measured in years - but the crew of the Enterprise-A can reach it in about a half hour).  The exact nature of what they find inside the Barrier is also never made clear.  And some of the dialogue and situations are downright hokey.<br />But what's good about No. 5?  First of all, the music is outstanding - Jerry Goldsmith at his best.  Second, the directing is truly not bad, especially for being Shatner's first feature film.  Certain moments even show a sign of brilliance, such as a long shot of the crew of the Enterprise staring at the viewscreen, watching the discovery being made, with the camera slowly zoomin in on an un-noticed sensor picking up a Klingon vessel closing in, with a faint hint of Goldsmith's Klingon Theme creeping in just as the Bird of Prey appears on sensors.<br />The movie is decidedly more lighthearted in tone than the others, except maybe for No. 4 - the Voyage Home.  As another reviewer once said, it seemed like they tried to artificially capture the humor from the 4th film, and that's probably fair.  But that does not make it all together unentertaining.  Lines such as &quot;I liked him (Spock) better before he died,&quot; and &quot;Spock: I am well versed in the classics.  McCoy: Then how come you don't know Row, Row, Row Your Boat?&quot; still resonate with me as classic moments from the classic cast.  <br />Compared to other Trek films, this one does leave much to be desired.  It doesn't have the drama and epic battles of Khan.  It doesn't have the cleverness of Voyage Home.  It lacks the political intrigue of the Undiscovered Country.  But against the other &quot;weak&quot; films, a.k.a. the odd numbered ones as many Trek fans like to say, this movie holds its own - compared to The Motion Picture, The Search for Spock, Generations, and Insurrection, I think this movie has many advantages.<br />This is a must have to complete your Star Trek collection, and should not be reviled as a necessary evil.  Every Star Trek story (be it an episode or a movie) has its own charm, and this is certainly no exception.  Don't expect rivetting drama, but do expect an entertaining, mostly lighthearted story with a modicum of suspense and wonder.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|Before I write this, I must state that I love Enigma dearly.  That said, this CD is truly horrible.  The only good tracks are &quot;From East to West&quot;, &quot;Voyageur&quot;, and &quot;Page of Cups&quot;.  As for the rest of the tracks, Enigma has completely lost their mysterious, ethereal aura in favor of a trashy pop sound.  Listen to this album carefully before you buy it!
B000021YQV|1.0|This [guy] can't sing.  The music is nu metal [crap]....with no talent.  If you like this, you are under 18 years old.  Otherwise, shame on you.  This [garbage] deserves zero stars.  Are these guys terrorists?
0805017445|5.0|This is one of the first book we read for my daughter.  We read it everyday since birth till now.  She is now 11 months old.  Believe it or not when we ask her to find teacher.  She would be able to find the teacher page and point it to us.  We are so please with the result. We bought at least 5 of this to give away for baby showers.  We would highly recomended this book.  Hope you will enjoy as much as we do.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|First let me state that Rufus Wainwright is brilliant and that I absolutely love this album. It deserves every one of its four stars. The only negative thing about Want One is that it is not as good as Wainwright's previous two albums. <br />The style remains very individualistic. He still doesn't sound like anyone else, but he's moving closer to the pop realm and farther from the pseudo-operatic roots. The lyrics aren't quite as engaging as the previous albums' (though they are still brilliant) and they are harder to make out (though that is why we have a lyrics booklet!)<br />All around I'd say this album is brilliant though, and I am certainly buying the second half of it. (Why didn't they just trust the fans and make a two disc set???) Anywho, hope this helps!
B00000I924|5.0|Jeff proves with this album that he's definitely not \\"washed-up\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  \\"Brush With The Blues\\" proves it.  Listen to the ear-piercing howl of his guitar at 3:02 into the song.  Unbelievable.  And \\"Angel (Footsteps)\\"  contains the most BEAUTIFUL notes to ever emanate from a guitar.  It's just as simple as that.
B00005QDW1|4.0|This album is packed with interesting songs with different beats and rhythms. Some of the songs int his album are different from older No Doubt songs. My favorite songs in this album are &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Running&quot;, and &quot;In My Head&quot;. &quot;Running&quot; is a slower song with a really good message in it. One good thing about this album is that it contains no annoying song. There's no song that you might rather skip. Anyway, this is a good-to-have album. It's the first No Doubt album that I have bought. I have heard from people who have listened to previous No Doubt albums that this one is pretty bad compared to the other ones, but I don't think that this album is bad at all.
B0000507PC|4.0|Cider House Rules is a fine account of the journeys of Homer, an orphan boy.  Tobey Maguire portrays the lead role very well displaying much innocence and curiosity of the wrold around him. Some may be offended by his stance on abortions, but to me I can look beyond politics. Michael Caine is fine in a supporting role as Dr. Lerch. There are certainly many elements to his multi-faceted character. Also, Delroy Lindo stands out quite notably as the lead migrant worker on the farm Homer goes to live.  its interesting how Lindo's character both loves his daughter as a father and as a lover. You want to think of Lindo as evil but there is another side to him particularly in the final scene in which he appears.<br />As evolving as the story is, there are many beautfiul scenery shots where the skyline is just stunning.  The architecture of the orphanage just completes the aesthetic beauty.  Overall, this earns my recommendation on all accounts.
0783225547|3.0|Young vulcanologist goes to small town, scares the local businessmen with his talk of possible eruption; his own boss doesn't take him seriously and stupidly assures the local people that there is no danger; they go into the cone to take readings and almost die; feisty old person doesn't want to leave the mountain....how many more similarities do you need?<BR>Dante's Peak is more or less a re-write of St. Helens, the 1981 film with Art Carney. Of course, modern technology makes this a much more explosive, dramatic movie. Modern technology unfortunately can't make it less goofy.
B000002J1O|4.0|Selling England By The Pound is indeed one of the high points in the long career of Genesis.  Each of the band members put much thought and time in creating the music.  Especially noteworthy is the opening piece, Dancing Wuth The Moonlit Knight.  He starts off at a slow and yearning pace.  Peter Gabriel's vocals sound so poignant.  However, when the band kicks in there are some stunning instrumental embelleshments.  I absolutely adore Steve Hackett's guitar solos on this piece.  Tony Banks and Phil Collins are pretty compelling as well.<br />Many other highlights exist as well.  The end solo to Cinema Show cries with beauty.  Tony Banks sure did vary his keyboard tones on this release.  The Phil Collins sung More Fool Me is quite pretty with nice guitar accompanyment by Steve Hackett.  I could go on and on but truthfully each one of these eight songs have strong qualities.<br />The only minor drawback is that most of the songs are quite long.  Halfof them exceed eight minutes in length with two of them lasting over eleven minutes.  Sometimes the noodling get be a bit patience trying.  However, most of the time this record stands very strong on creativity and musical improv.<br />If you are going to explore the music of Genesis, I would say to start with The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Trick Of The Tail, and this one.
B000007MVM|5.0|If music has to be written it must be for the sheer love of it , as in this album.This album is like an old man trying to live out his remaining days doing things he loves most as best as he can. <BR>I must rank it as one of the most emotional albums ever made and syd probably wasn't aware of it when he wrote all the songs. The album has such innocent brilliance. A lot of the songs are well thought out and very well executed(No good trying,Octopus, Golden hair,Here I go  Late night, Terrapin). In songs like Dark globe, feel,if it's in you, he's clearly not in total control of himself. And that just adds to the charm and emotion.Golden hair is another gem.<BR>It's like he' saying,'I cannot do any better.This is what i think the songs should sound like.And i think its pretty good,you know.' <BR>We truly lost a crazy diamond.
0140131558|4.0|Paul Auster's 'New York Trilogy' is widely hailed as a great piece of modern fiction.<br />I agree. As a whole, it's fantastic. Reading each individual book, you'd never really figure out the connection between them all; which is almost a bonus in some ways. It leaves each one as a startling and enigmatic mark in your mind for days.<br />However, the first two, especially City of Glass, are wonderful.<BR>The third and last, the Locked Room, leaves a little to be desired. As a &quot;tie up&quot; for the first two, I find that the story and conclusion (one in the same) leave something to be desired and, while it does bear the mark of Auster's type of ending... it didn't feel to me like it was the best possible ending.
B000002NG7|5.0|After &quot;King for a day&quot; there were a lot of rumors that faith no more's members are about to go their separate ways... <BR>instead of that, they came back with an even greater album! <BR>Mike Patton sounds like a god and the band are going crazy with songs like &quot;Mouth to mouth&quot; And &quot;Got that feeling&quot; but still take things seriously in songs like &quot;Ashes to ashes&quot; and the amazing &quot;Last cup of sorrow&quot;... Pure fun! Great Inspiration!
0375758992|5.0|I picked this book up because one of my favorite pop culture magazines had named it the best non-fiction book of the year at some point.  Still, I must admit that I did not expect it to be quite so good.  I was absolutely absorbed in this book and practically lived in it for the few days it took me to finish it - and I certainly drew them out as long as I could because I did not want it to end!<br />Alexandra Fuller recounts her experiences growing up in various African countries, part of the white colonialist presence in Rhodesia and other countries.  Her family endures more than its share of hardships, and Ms. Fuller conveys them honestly, touchingly and in great detail.  She does not shy away from some of the less flattering aspects of her parents' participation in a colonialist culture, nor does she pretend that they were free from any sort of prejudice toward the Africans with whom they lived.  Yet Ms. Fuller does explain much of it - why her parents chose Africa and Rhodesia, Malawi and so forth, why she viewed the natives as she did, what she and her sister feared, and so on and so forth.<br />While this frankness is refreshing, what makes this book so excellent is Ms. Fuller's writing, which is simply brilliant.  She describes the lush landscapes, the danger of mines, the violence, the poverty and so on with such intense and vivid details that the book truly comes to life.  Her experiences growing up in Africa may have been in some ways similar to those of other colonialists, yet she makes her story unique through her insights, her sympathy and empathy, and through the changes that she describes - those of the countries in which she lives, herself, her mother, father, sister and others.  That Ms. Fuller's possess an incredible gift for writing is obvious, as is her command of language, with every word and phrase clearly chosen with great care.<br />I could not recommend this book more highly.  I really believe that it is one of the best that I have ever readand certainly one of the best in the past several years.  Already I have begun lending it out, and those who have read it have shared my fascination.  Simply put, it is not to mbe missed!
B000006NPY|4.0|Since the days of Gish,I've always had a love/hate thing with The Pumpkins.My biggest gripes are a)the lyric try too hard to sound relevent &amp; clever all at once&amp; b)Uncle Fester..er I mean Billy Corgan nasally whiny vocals.<BR> Since Adore is a more introspective and quiet album ,those two points come front &amp; center.With previous albums,it was easy to overlook both due to the fact their signature buzzsaw guitars &amp; crafty hooks prevail.But with this album,many of the lyrics just don't do justice for these beautifully arranged songs.On To Sheila the scattered lyrics mar a very beautiful acoustic ballad,and Pistol Pete &amp; Dusty sounds like vault material from Elton's Tumbleweed Connection.<BR> But what Corgan lacks in words he makes up for it in his composition &amp; production genius.Theres no denying the man's talent.The music he visualise in his head ,onto our digitally encoded piece of aluminum is amazing.He can write hard rock &amp; pretty ballads with a sense of balance according to each songs needs,and that what makes Adore such a beautifully crafted album.It seem that he has more clarity in expressing himself in his music than his lyrics.
B0000C8AVE|4.0|Now then this SACD.Brilliant, music and recording. Real presence and timbre. The reason I dont give it the full five stars is when did Bobby use a seperate acoustic guitar player and harmonica player? On some tracks the voice is dead centre, the harmonica comes from the right speaker and the guitar from the left speaker. Some tracks eg dont think twice are spot on. By the way when you buy your SACD dont forget to ask for your 7 track free Bob Dylan promo sampler. They are selling for $10+ on ebay.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Core may have hit harder,&amp; Tiny Music may mix bravery with bubblegum,but Purple is where STP shed the quipes at being the &quot;Stone Gossard Pilots&quot;.<BR> They come into they're own sound as well as bring in a varied mix of songs.Interstate Love Songs is the best of the lot as well as the hypnotic Vasoline.Big Empty is superior to the similarly sounding Creep(from Core).Even the non singles stand up well(Meatplow,Pretty Penny,and Lounge Fly).<BR> Even if the industry washes STP of their hands(due to Scott Wieland's recent woes,Shangra-La-Dee Da's less-than-stellar chart performance,and the unpredictable status of the band)Purple will stand as the one album where they survived the barbs as well as the sophmore slump.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Sadly, I really liked this CD- its (to me, compared to everything else I listen to) kinda upbeat. Good music for working out, but a little to smooth and overly produced for just listening to. I think that the immense sucess of Linkin Park is due to the fact that they seem to angsty about everything, all the time. Their concerts are amazing, but after a while, I think I'm going to scream if I hear &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; one more time.
B000000W5B|4.0|Coming after the monumental,yet substance fueled Exile On Main Street,The Rolling Stones notorious excess takes it's toll on GHS.<BR> The musicianship suffer ,resulting in the album sounding a bit lazy and winded as well as some songs being sub-par.Only Angie and the underrated Doo Doo Doo(Heartbreaker)stand out as well as Kieth Richard's lament Coming Down Again.Star Star is all hustle and half muscle.<BR> Coming after Beggars-Bleed-Sticky-Exile classic album block(All produced by Jimmy Miller, who would bow out after this album),it seemed worse than many made it to be,but GHS would set the tone for future releases to come.
B000002MT0|4.0|I donno maybe its the title &quot;Come&quot; or the fact that it signified the Death of &quot;Prince&quot;.  PRince threw together a highly erotic very dark and abusive compilation with this album.  Trying to hurt His then lable &quot;Warner bros&quot; but what he didnt know is. Their are many gems and well written songs on this C.D.  its really a bump and grind C.D.  I can see the begginning of prince's Spoken Word Poetry Later seen on Emancipation and crystal Ball . But to be honest the real problem with this C.D. is a small portion of the songs just need to be remixed like &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;Dark&quot;. But songs like Come, Space and Papa are the real gems Full of tempo rising grooves and heavy breather melodies. Papa especially is a key song.  A chilling Song about an abusive father putting out all his frustration on his four year old son (PRince). I assume its autobiographical makes me respect prince a whole lot more. <BR>All in All its a very promising C.D. that has been bashed for ages!<BR>Buy it Give it a chance you might like it lol<br />PRince O the times
079073253X|5.0|With a gripping story, augmented by the moral and ethical dilemmas of a lawyer, a journalist, and a priest, Barry Levinson's SLEEPERS is heart-pounding drama at its finest.  Set in New York's Hell's Kitchen--with all of its subsequent turbulence and socioeconomic dysfunction--this film tells the story of four boys, four lifelong pals, who are sadistically brutalized in a reform school and carry the scars into their adult lives.<br />It comes as no surprise that two of the four embark on a problematic life of crime; it comes as even less of a surprise that when a former reform school guard is seen eating in a diner the two men extract a brutal and bloody revenge.<br />At this point SLEEPERS embarks on a breathless course of twists and turns, with one underlying, consistent theme:  the unbroken bond of friendship.  With their friends on trial for murder, the other two men, a prosecuting attorney (Brad Pitt) and a journalist (Jason Patric) put their careers and reputations on the line to exonerate the defendants--who are indeed guilty of murder--and to malign the former guard who was killed.  The stage is set for courtroom drama that is literally spellbinding.<br />Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, and Minnie Driver are exceptional in this film, but the cast is trumped by two &quot;oldtimers,&quot; Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro.  Hoffman plays an alcoholic defense attorney in over his head for the trial, while De Niro--as a loving priest who has been a father figure to all four of the boys--faces a titanic decision as he is called to testify as an important witness.  The acting is compelling and absorbing, and so is the story.  SLEEPERS is about as good as a drama can get.<br />--D. Mikels
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I wish Erykah could get more respect - the album has not been marketed properly - but I'm glad it debuted number 3 - it should have been number 1 though - from the start to the end this album is funky and creative.  Whoever criticizes this album knows nothing about real music. HOLLA
B000092ZYX|5.0|ok...judging from the complaints i've read thus far, i'll have to say that most of them dislike the album while comparing it to the band's earlier days.  and yes, the band has changed direction...and i believe for the BETTER!!!  i loved Kid A...not too crazy about amnesiac, but i really like hail to the thief (with the exception of like one song).  these songs are not your regular rock songs - but they depict an atmosphere that i can lose myself in for hours.
0316921173|4.0|With \\"Infinite Jest,\\" David Foster Wallace has created an exhaustive, and exhausting, look at modern life.  Set in a twisted but strangely recognizable near-future North American semi-dystopia, the book sets forth Wallace's own post-apocalyptic vision.  Wallace's future hasn't been ravaged by nuclear war, but rather by Americans' increasing dependence on material possessions, controlled substances, and above all, entertainment.  Although you have to navigate through Wallace's myriad (and often entertaining) rhetorical excesses to find them, this book is filled with profound statements on the nature of choice and the pull of addiction.<br />The radically non-linear plot is centered on a likably dysfunctional family named the Incandenzas.  James Incandenza (aka Himself), a tennis-academy founder and wannabe film artiste, has killed himself by sticking his head in a microwave before the book's action, leaving his promiscuous wife and three sons: the emotionless tennis/lexicographal prodigy Hal, professional football punter Orin, and the deformed but endearing Mario.  Their everyday problems may be removed from what most readers experience, but Wallace still manages to make the Incandenzas, including the late and eccentric Himself, into relatable characters in one way or another.<br />Himself has also left another legacy in the form of \\"Infinite Jest,\\" an entertainment cartridge (the book takes place after conventional TV has given way to all-cartridge viewing) so addictive that it turns the viewer into a mindless zombie with no desire whatsoever to do anything but watch the film again.  A group of murderous and legless Quebecois separists (the Wheelchair Assassins, who provided the inspiration for my reviewer name) are trying to get a hold of a master copy of this tape to distribute throughout the newly created Organization Of North American Nations.  If this cartridge sounds like a metaphor, it's because it is.  It isn't hard to guess that Wallace probably feels modern-day notions of entertainment are rotting our brains and free will even as we speak, albeit a lot more slowly and insidiously.<br />The plot isn't the main attraction here, though.  It merely serves a springboard for some inspired weirdness.  Not even Chuck Palahniuk displays such a gift for alternating between the profound and oddball as Wallace.  In one scene, two characters are having a philosophical debate about the nature of choice in modern-day society.  In another, Wallace is expounding on Orin Incandenza's gift for punting a football (as a raging football fan, I found this passage especially enthralling).  In another, we get to see how the United States ceded its toxic waste-infested Northeast corner to Canada to form O.N.A.N.  What do these three passages have to do with each other?  Little to nothing, but they're all gripping just the same.<br />Wallace devotes long passages to the state of America life in his near future and how it got that way.  His descriptions of the evolution of entertainment from TV to viewing cartridges displays a remarkable perception of how entertainment works and what people want from it.  Wallace occasionally delves into winding, wordy descriptions of Himself's film work, which apparently straddled a fine line between profound and pretentious.  Himself's films, with names like \\"Blood Sister: One Tough Nun,\\" \\"Baby Pictures Of Famous Dictators\\" and \\"Good Looking Men In Small Clever Rooms That Utilize Every Centimeter Of Available Space With Mind-Boggling Efficiency,\\" serve as catalysts for speculations on what people like Himself hope to achieve through film, how others view it, and what our views of entertainment say about us as individuals.<br />The book, as this site's editorial review mentions, contains an enormous cast befitting a work of such magnitude, and Wallace has a knack for creating flawed, but likeable, characters.  Much of the action takes place at a tennis academy and drug addicts' halfway house in the fictional Massachusetts town of Enfield, and Wallace paints vivid portraits of the residents of both of these institutions.  Everyone is this book seemingly has some sort of issue, whether in their past or present, and there are few if any characters here who could be described as completely \\"normal.\\"  But that's part of what makes reading this book fun.<br />Of course, the most attention-grabbing aspect of the book is Wallace's stunning verbal dexterity.  This guy can seemingly make words do whatever he wants them to do, and I often found myself enthralled by passages that had little if anything to do with any conventional plot mechanism.  Wallace's description of an amazingly abstract and complex tennis-academy game called Eschaton may not serve any real purpose in the narrative, but it had me glued to the pages just the same.  He even manages to make tennis, a sport in which I have no interest whatsoever, seem fascinating because he writes with such a wide-ranging scope and grasp of detail.<br />Of course, with a book this long (about a thousand pages), what I've written is just an overview.  Everyone can get something different out of this book, and if some of the less enthusiastic reviews on this site are any indication, some people will get nothing out of it.  But you still owe it to yourself to read it and find out for yourself what it holds for you.  So if you have an extra three months or so on your hands, \\"Infinite Jest\\" is definitely worth your time.assachusetts town of Enfield, and Wallace paints vivid portraits of the residents of both of these institutions.

B00006F7S4|2.0|I started listening to Beck for his humor and genre-mixing.  While the idea of Beck getting serious intrigued me, the actual album didn't.  Every song on the album feels the same.  While others might be excited by the presence of someone who has produced for Radiohead and one of Beck's earlier albums, Mutations, the airy production only further detracts from the album.  Syd Barrett, one of the big influences you'll hear here, had a sound of immediacy--on his solo recordings, it's as if he's right next to you, singing and strumming his guitar.  Here, the production covers up Beck and obscures the lyrics.<br />If you like acoustic psychedelic Syd Barrett-esque music, try Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot--it's what this album should have been like.  If you still want a low-key Beck, try Mutations instead.
B0000AFQS0|4.0|What can I say? The Who rule! Or at least, did once upon a time. This is a smoking DVD with lots of great features etc... I only give it 4 out of 5 stars cause the audio quality blows massively! Absolutely no comparison to the new Led Zeppelin DVD's audio quality- so don't expect it. I'm really surprised they dropped the ball on fine-tuning the audio here, since it would have made the DVD ten times better.
B00001OH80|2.0|When I first borrowed this album on vinyl, it got off to a pretty promising start.  &quot;Loving the Alien&quot; is more &quot;Bowie&quot; than a good deal of the stuff on Let's Dance (though that album is still a good pop album).   &quot;Blue Jean&quot; is the only other decent song on this album; the rest, unfortunately, is incredibly bland.  It IS better than Never Let Me Down, the album that followed it, but that's not saying much....if you do want to buy it, get it used for a decent price (under $10).  If you're not too keen on `80s Bowie and don't want to buy the entire album, find a US copy of the Rykodisk Singles set (it's not in print anymore)--it includes &quot;Blue Jean,&quot; the special single version of &quot;Loving the Alien,&quot; and some other singles-only songs that are well worth getting (plus, of course, tons of `70s singles, though they sound tinny compared to the more recent Virgin/BMI remasters).

We've all heard &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, and &quot;Overprotected&quot;, which are all great singles in my opinion.  The album version of &quot;Boys&quot; may not feature the Neptunes, but it's still just as good as the remix, which I can't really say for other songs remixed for the radio!  &quot;Lonely&quot; is an upbeat song about moving on after a break-up.  &quot;Anticipating&quot; is a mid-tempo song that sort of reminds me of a song out of the 1960's-1970's mixed in with modern pop.  &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot;  is, of course, a cover of a classic that Britney manages to pull off very well!!  This one is featured on &quot;Crossroads&quot;, which is an excellent film despite scathing reviews from critics!  &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, and &quot;What It's Like To Me&quot; are all excellent uptempos!  &quot;Let Me Be&quot; is a midtempo that still manages to stand on it's own two feet and not be filler.  To help describe this album overall, if you love 'N Sync's &quot;Celebrity&quot;, you'll love this since the uptempos on this Britney release are a bit similar to the uptempos on &quot;Celebrity&quot;.  Worth the money!  I don't even have to skip over tracks!!  I especially recommend listening to this while you're in the shower in the morning!  I do and it definitely gives me a burst of A.M. energy!  Sure, Britney doesn't write her own songs or play an instrument.  BUT WHO CARES?!  THE MUSIC FUN TO LISTEN TO!!  And even I'll admit she's not exactly the best singer in the world!  But she takes the voice that she has and puts out some amazing albums, unlike Jennifer Lopez!  If you don't own this Britney release, get it and also preorder her upcoming album, &quot;In The Zone&quot;!
B00008BRB5|5.0|I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS ALBULM, BECAUSE MY FATHER BOUGHT IT FOR ME, I LISTENED TO IT OVER AND OVER, I THINK IT STARTED ME ON MY CARREER PATH. THE REVIEW I JUST READ WAS SO TRUE ABOUT THE JUNG PART OF THAT ALBULM. KING OF PAIN WHAT CAN YOU SAY.... I JUST CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ALBUM,EXCEPT THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR IT ON CD NOW
B00005JL78|5.0|First, this movie is fast paced (shorter than two hours, I think), so you know that just by the awesome blue, futuristic settings, and the fact that the main character is a cop, you're going to have to pay attention reeeaaal hard. That does come in handy.<BR>I'm a computer geek, and I thought the way they did computers and just the whole background of the place was plain awesome. And Precrime kicked butt! Plus Tom Cruise is... never mind.<BR>What I liked about this movie was the eerie, melancholy way it was. Just the whole morbid setting, with the cerulean glow that the movie SCREAMS out. I personally think the plot could have done with a thicker setting, and less twists, because I felt that if a bird sang I would lose the concentration and train of thought - in other words, the dialogue wasn't loud enough, the plot was much too twisty, and there seemed to be too many characters in the way.<BR>But, in the end, it call came together. Though there were still some lose ends, but then again, I missed the first fifteen minutes of the movie. <BR>Another thing was that I'm going to bring to attention was at some parts the graphics really sucked. Just the computer generations... it bit! But then at others it was awesome.<BR>You would never be able to guess that Speilberg directed &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; movie &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; A.I.. Overall, it was a great movie.
6304806442|5.0|This movie is great, it has a great mix of comedy, and some depressing stuff. The movie is very realistic, it shows the highs and lows of using heroin, the negatives certainly out wegh the pluses, and i would consider it a very anti-drug movie. Because unless you are a moron and think that the stuff that happened to him, his friend, and friends g/f was good. then you should probably go do it and die. Sorry for being so harsh but its true, you'd have to be really dumb to watch this movie and think its pro-drug use. Although they do use alot of drugs in the movie, thats really not what its about. Well it is, but it isn't; its basically just about a group of friends, 3 of which happen to do heroin. And the others 2 aren't that great of being friends in the first place. The good friend in the movie, shouldn't of done what he did. Lots of lessons to be learnt from this movie.<br />The comdey in this movie is something else, omg. It is so hilarious at times, i laughed so hard. That one part, with spud is the best, omg i laughed so many times, i still laugh whenever i see it. And the part while he's at the interview, hilarious.
B0000C8AQM|1.0|The film contained references to 4 AC/DC songs, only one of which is on the CD.  Clearly, the producers regard AC/DC as the greatest rock band ever, so why not include at least one AC/DC performance on the disc?
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I like Rufus Wainwright, but his CDs were never the ones I would listen to days on end.  At first, I listened to this CD and wasn't particularly fond of it.  Then I listened to it again.  And again.  By this point, it was all over.  The brilliant songs never leave my head.  Every night I fall asleep listening to the perfect orchestrations.  If there's one thing this album really illustrates, it's truth.
0449227545|4.0|I started reading this great book while on the john one day and it riveted me to numbness. I couldn't put it down and then I couldn't stand up. I know, just a little more info than most of you probably needed.<br />There is plenty of action and suspense. I haven't finished it yet but I can tell that Ken Follett is going to be an author that I will enjoy picking up about any of his books and reading them.<br />I was given this book by a very strange individual and the moral here is Never Judge a Book by it's Cover! I thought she was giving me some kind of religious book and I don't do those, well wasn't I most pleasantly suprised when I finally started reading it and I am sure that if you like a little mystery, intrigue and a little suspense with lots of action right from the very beginning then this will be a book that you may very well enjoy.
B000066NW0|1.0|My name is Katie.  I am a girl that thinks Avril Laveen is my American Idol.  She is pretty and I want to wear her baggy pants.  She looks mean and that scares me, but daddy tells me she is faking.  Britny is pretty too but my mommy says she is dirty and kisses other dirty girls.  Daddy called Britny a thespian.  I do not know what that is, but I want to be a genus like Avril and Britny Speers.<br />Avril makes good music.  I dance to Avril and Kidz Bop.  I would like to hear Avril do some other things that make me feel good.  My friends told me that Avril is smart, but mommy told me that she does not make her own music.  I like the genuses that make her music for her.  It does make me sad that she does not write her own music.<br />I just saw Avril on Saterday Nite Live.  She was not very happy and did not sound very good.  She just stood there and sang, and she sang bad.  <br />Avril is really getting on my nerves.  The more I listen to her CD, I realize that it is not even her own music.  My father called her Avrilli Vanilli.  She complains about nothing of importance.  Britney does the same thing.  I think I don't like Avril and Britney anymore.  In fact, I loath them.<br />I wonder if Avril Lavigne has ever experienced any of these things she sings about?  If other people write her songs -that appear to be personal in nature-then why does she act as if her life has been so bad?  As if she has been deprived of oxygen on an oxygen-rich planet, that whiny little brat.<br />Listening to this fake garbage has made me grow up quick.  Bye-bye.

B00005OAIE|1.0|This cat is shameless.  But he's brave.  Any man that makes a buffoon of himself like John Mayer needs to be commended.  I mean, let's face it: I certainly couldn't stand on stage, bouncing one leg jubilently, playing the guitar from a raised position, and contort my voice in a blatant attempt to mimic Dave Matthews'.  <br />So we know that Mayer's voice is a rip-off...  But does the music on \\"Room For Squares\\" sound like Dave Matthews Band (DMB)'s stuff?  Well, it's nothing like the early music of DMB: masterful no-holds-barred, sometimes funkadelic/sometimes acid-jazzy, drumming; anti-4/4 song writing; and emotionally all-encompassing violin additions...  Rather, Mayer offers us a drastically toned-down, amateur version of DMB: imagine the weakest song(s) on \\"Everyday\\" (not to imply that this album is bad at all, but almost every CD has its relative duds); now subtract the musicianship, and viola!, you have \\"Room For Squares\\".<br />A couple of examples:<br />#5 \\"NEON\\":  Boring, overused, pseudo-funk guitar licks beat in the dirt by Jamiroquai are integrated with novice Carter Bruford techniques (Just listen to the copy-catting of the hi-hat \\"work\\" [such as backbeats, etc.], and you'll hear what I mean.) to yield a highly one-dimensional, top-40 product.  <br />#3 \\"MY STUPID MOUTH\\":  A shining example of \\"Everday\\" knock-off-ery.  4/4-beat, bubble gum pop-like vocals, and completely unimaginative -catchy, if you're a sucker for top-40 money-makers- acoustic guitar patterns.  A cheap, completely non-addictive sedative, like most of this rubbish.<br />I liken the logic behind buying \\"Room For Squares\\" to buying a bike at Wal-Mart when you already own a Trek of much higher quality.
0060930349|5.0|Although this book is nearly a thousand pages long, there are only eight defined parts. This is only one way in which a lot of material is structured in a way to make it hold together as one unified work. As the title suggests, the heart of the book is the profile of American individuals, but told only in a quasi-biographical form. Rather than fill every profile with every detail, Johnson picks out the essential details, with a goal toward letting the reader get to know these individuals as people first, and historical figures second. In that sense, it takes some of the shine off of the icons of American history and makes them more real. For instance, the achievements of James Madison the revolutionary are well-known to most students of history; his folly as president doesn't get as much attention. Yet Johnson tells this side of Madison's career as well, with unflinching detail.<br />Johnson does a great job of relating these lives to the backdrop of the broader context that affected their lives. For instance, in describing the founding of each colony, Johnson's view that even at the very beginning, the nature and development of the northern and southern colonies were set up for the conflict leading to the Civil War. By highlighting this aspect, it helps set up the reader for a conflict that gets mentioned again 300 pages later.<br />Other literary devices are used as well. In describing the experience women and families had during the Revolutionary War, a striking anecdote is told about Elizabeth Jackson's children/soldiers who suffered at the hands of the British. It is mentioned without any special attention that the youngest (and who would lose his entire family) was named Andrew. In effect, this passage (p.174-75) serves a dual purpose, one in the immediate context, and also as foreshadowing for a hundred pages later when Andrew Jackson emerges onto the national scene.<br />Every once in a while, Johnson steps into the role of historical myth-debunker, whetherit be to correct blatant and untrue attacks on Warren G. Harding, to put Richard Nixon's political career in context with the East Coast media's hostility, or the behind-the-scenes work it took to create the image of John F. Kennedy, and the same media's complicity in allowing it to happen, all the way into his presidency.<br />The book concludes in 1997, so obviously there has been a lot of major events that have happened in America over the relatively short time since then. But the book is still a very enjoyable read, even if the low-key ending can now only be seen as a prelude.

B000075BFK|5.0|This is another album by the lyrical genius 2pac. Here you find meaningful songs, just like in any other 2pac album, listen to \\"Who do you believe in\\"  \\"My Block\\" and \\"Better Dayz\\" You won't find songs in this album about Escalades, bling-bling jewelry and nonsense. This is a must have album, if you like rap there is no chance you could be disappointed. Having so many double albums released while not being among us, proves his brilliance in music making, if you were going to buy a CD, go buy Better Dayz.

B0000AUHPB|4.0|It seems that good movies inspire remakes. As to whether they are &quot;inspired&quot; remakes is always open to question. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting but for sheer acting chops and fun (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake who seems like he's trapped in a film he doesn't like), 1969's The Italian Job is my personal pick of the two. Mark Wahlberg can't hold a candle (and isn't much of an actor frankly)to Michael Caine in the original film.<br />There's almost as many things that make this classic film tick as there are seconds on a clock. The plot focuses more on the getaway than the caper. This unique twist turned the formular on its head. The terrific cast (including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearence and, of all people, Benny Hill!)features the marvelous Michael Caine in the lead. He gives a great performance and helps the ensemble rise to the occasion.<br />The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and wit bringing to life what could have been, despite its plot twists, a routine film. Collinson is something of a cult director who died relatively young before he could fulfill his full promise as a director. I'd also recommend his cult classic psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning which became available last year on DVD. While it's hampered by some mid-70's editing and visual conventions, Morning more than holds its own with the explotiation films of the time.<br />Complimenting the film is a commentary track which features the film's original producer as well as a number of nice extras. It's great to also have this minor classic finally restored to its proper aspect ratio. The DVD transfer is pretty good and while the quality of the print varies a bit, it's really good on the whole.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|The only thing wrong with The Italian Job is a miscast Mark Wahlberg and a misused Charlize Theron. It's a pity that the film wasn't cast with an actor of Ed Norton's caliber in the role of Charlie Croker (played by Wahlberg. Norton can be quite a charming actor and it would have been interesting to see him in the role.  Like the horrible reimagined Planet of the Apes, The Italian Job isn't a remake as such but using the same basic dramatic situation to create a new, interesting and kinetic film.<br />The plot has been pretty well summarized before but it hinges more on the revenge angle than the original film (if memory serves); Charlie Croker (Wahlberg)and his mentor's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron)are going after one of their own. Ed Norton plays Steve a member of their gang who steals from his friends and then bumps off the John Bridges the head of their gang (Donald Sutherland). Croker and Stella set up the ultimate scam/heist to get what was theirs to begin with and extract revenge for the murder.<br />The latter part of the film is set in Los Angeles although the Mini-Cooper's so prominent in the original film still have more than a featured cameo. Turning the original film's basic plot on its head helps make this version a refreshing take on the original tale.<br />F. Gary Gray's direction infuses the film with enough energy to fuel two films. His direction is crisp, sharp and usually on target. The cast he and the producers assembled (including the marvelous Seth Green)can, for the most part, more than hold their own against the Michael Caine's crew in the 1969 film. The only major drawback, again, is Wahlberg who is adequate but doesn't bring any charisma to the role. A better choice to cast in the film would have been George Clooney who at least has the wattage to light up the role.<br />The widescreen transfer looks very, very good. I don't own but did get a glimpse of the fullscreen version as well and it looked fairly good as well. The extras include five featurettes on everything from the making of the film to the stunt driving. While there isn't a director's commentary (much less one from the cast), perhaps that's all for the better. It seems the action speaks for itself. You'll notice you can get both films as a two DVD set. If you're a fan of the original and have seen this version and liked it, then it might be a better way to go vs. buying them individually. Unfortunately, the two Jobs set doesn't include anything beyond what's on them individually, so the only benefit might be in saving a bit of money. While it's not a bus full of gold, The 2003 film packs enough thrills, chills and spills to make it worthwhile viewing if nothing else than for a rental.ude five featurettes on everything from the making of the film to the stunt driving.

B000005JA8|5.0|I HATED this album on first listen.  I just didn't understand a thing about it.  Every track sounded different, yet equally horrible and I just figured I had purchased the most over-rated piece of garbage ever produced.  I was wrong.  This is definitely every bit the masterpiece it is claimed to be and is easily one of the most important records ever recorded.  I think it is safe to say that there will never be another album like this recorded and that is probably for the best because no one could top this.  If you really want a pretty amazing musical experience I would recommend purchasing this, but be prepared for anything and everything.  I would actually suggest downloading some of the songs first like Moonlight In Vermont or Dachau Blues.  If you like these songs I think it is safe to say you will like the album.

630289915X|2.0|&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; was so very UN-wonderful to the American public when it opened that the only reason that most people have seen it is that it was allowed to go into &quot;public domain&quot; because the studio didn't want to waste the money it would cost to renew the copyright!<br />Beaten to death for years by being played on TV stations across America (who could air it for free), it was sometimes shown by three or more competing stations in the same market ... simultaneously.<br />Unable to escape this dreadful mush of shmaltz, millions of Americans were exposed to it.  With bits and pieces of it being shown in other films and TV shows (again, for free), there was no way to avoid having this &quot;meme&quot; drilled into one's consciousness.<br />Seen by itself at some other season than Xmas, shorn of all hoopla, this turns out to be a truly mediocre picture, which has cursed us even more by inspiring even worse remakes, adaptations, and parodies.<br />&quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (preferably the Alastair Sim version!!!) is the best Xmas viewing (preferably followed by one of the earlier versions of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;).<br />IMHO, of course.
B000089RVX|5.0|I fist heard Bring Me To Life when Daredevil came out. Once I heard it I knew I had to get the album Fallen. I'm glad I did. It's probably one of the best CD's I've listened to in a long time. The music on the album is a mix between Christian and gothic. I would definately recomend this album to anyone.
B00006EXDM|5.0|HOT ROCKS 1964-1971, in my opinion is the best Greatest Hits collection by the Stones. This 2CD set has all of their classic recordings from 64-71 which I feel was their most prolific period. If you're a Rolling Stones fan, this album should be in your music collection. All of the songs compiled on this special release are all gems but I do have some that I like more than others. This is an excellent collection and the music contained herein can be classified as timeless. No matter how many years go by these songs will always be part of a great musical style known as classic rock and will never be outdated.<br />My favorites songs on this collection are:&quot;Wild Horses&quot;, I really love this song I think its one of the best ballads ever written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, a great song with some great blues riffs, this one is a classic.<BR>&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, awesome song with great guitar and background vocals, I love the song's intro. &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; a real classic from beginning to end one of my favorites. &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;, fantastic tune I love the music and the lyrics to this song. &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;, simply superb and very original. I love when Jagger starts shouting somewhat to &quot;Hey baby ah, what's your name,. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; their first big hit and a great song. &quot;Let's Spend The Night Together&quot; love this one, this song puts me in the MOOD if you know what I mean. &quot;Play With Fire&quot; soft and mellow, really nice. &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; one of my all time favorites, I really like this one and I don't mind that is a little over 7 minutes. <br />These are basically my favorites on this album. A song that I love and is actually my favorite Stones song is &quot;Angie&quot; but as you know this great classic was not release till 1973, two years after this great collection. However, I pointed it out because I feel that on this particular song is where I feel that Mick Jagger's voice has been the best. Excellent CD, I highy recommend it is a CLASSIC for all times.

I know this doesnt have the famous songs like other AC/DC albums but thats one thing that makes this album even better! You havent heard all the sogns on Powerage 100 times before like You Shook Me All Night Long, and highway To Hell.

0446530891|4.0|September 1996: &quot;It took a split second, although to Secret Service Agent Sean King it seemed like the longest split second ever.&quot; King was protecting presidential candidate Clyde Ritter at a rally that was supposed to be low key. When the crowd moved closer to the guest of honor, King moved closer too and then he heard something --- a bang that sounded like a dropped book. The crowd panicked, the room exploded into chaos and Ritter was lying by King's feet, shot right through the heart.<br />Following this tragic incident, King retired from the Secret Service in disgrace. Over time he made a new life for himself. He became a small town attorney who built a dream house on the banks of a lake in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia far away from politics, government and guns.<br />Eight years later, another election is on the calendar and candidate John Bruno decides to take a side trip to pay his respects to a dead friend. His protector, Secret Service Agent Michelle Maxwell, is furious and frustrated, but she capitulates to his demands in order to keep as close to their schedule as possible. While Maxwell is counting the days until the election when her fast track career could put her in the White House guarding the president, she knows that sometimes one has to break protocol. Or do they? <br />Once there, Bruno angrily refuses to listen to Maxwell, who insists she will not leave his side. But his tantrum is easier to assuage if Maxwell again defers to him, so she allows him to enter the funeral parlor room alone. Then the unthinkable happens --- Bruno vanishes --- and as had happened to King, Maxwell is turned into a scapegoat and her career is over.<br />While King watches the news about the candidate's disappearance, he understands exactly what will happen to Maxwell --- she is going to be hung out to dry the same way he had. He then makes his way to his &quot;day job&quot; and finds a corpse in his office.<br />A few days later, Maxwell begins to research the events that led to King's downfall. She reads the material, studies the photographs and listens to the videotape. She listens so closely that she hears a sound --- a familiar noise that is eerily out of place. She knows that something is very wrong with what she has seen and heard. She feels an instinctive and overwhelming connection to King and decides to seek him out.<br />King listens as she tells him what she has discovered: confirmation of his legitimate distraction eight years before when a bullet killed a candidate and his bodyguard. Neither of them can ignore what they both now know --- especially since he is under investigation for the murder of the man in his office. The two ex-agents decide to work together and begin an odyssey that will take them down the dark halls of Washington politics, bring them into contact with the Federal Marshall Service, and push them forward into a vast conspiracy that was set in motion long before they came on the scene.<br />If you have a passion for intellectual thrillers whose architecture is erected like a puzzle that is superbly limned with suspense and the action is reminiscent of yesterday's news, SPLIT SECOND is an absolute must-read. All of David Baldacci's previous eight books have soared to the top of everyone's bestseller list and his oeuvre speaks to his talent, imagination, prose and ability to tell a story that is convincing, entertaining, fascinating and makes readers feel that they are on a magical mystery tour. SPLIT SECOND tells a very complex tale that will provoke readers to think about current issues in government and offers interesting glimpses into how the Secret Service works.<br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum

0312319517|4.0|It's hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since Frederick Forsyth wrote THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. It wasn't long after that book was published that the world learned there really was a Jackal and that, contrary to the ending of Forsyth's work of fiction, he was not killed moments after failing to assassinate Charles de Gaulle, but actually was still out running around. Forsyth's subsequent novels have accordingly been treated as if they are treatises concerning the hidden history of the world. AVENGER is no different, and while it may be a work of fiction, the foundation upon which it is written is chillingly real.<br />Forsyth spends a good deal of time --- almost the first third of the book --- setting his characters in space and time. As a result there is initially a great amount of jumping around. A lesser writer would have lost the thread of the narrative, and indeed Forsyth is almost a victim of his own cleverness.<br />Part of the gambit involves an idealistic American youth, fresh out of college, who joins a non-government humanitarian relief effort in war-torn Serbia and is casually tortured and murdered by a band of anonymous marauding outlaws led by a violent and dangerous psychopath who seems to have vanished after the deed was done.<br />The victim's grandfather, a self-made millionaire, seeks that which is almost impossible to obtain: justice. He wants his beloved grandson's killer brought to the United States and tried for murder before a court of law. For this, he is placed in contact with a man known only as Avenger.<br />Avenger is Pete Dexter, a former &quot;tunnel rat,&quot; the name given to an elite team of American soldiers who conducted seek-and-destroy missions in the network of enemy tunnels utilized during the Vietnam War. Forsyth takes his time explaining what Dexter did, and who he was, just so that we can get an idea of what sort of skills he brings to the table as Avenger.<br />Dexter now lives quietly, practicing law in a smalltown in Pennsylvania and giving no clue to his past nor to his occasional work as a highly skilled, highly paid mercenary. There is no smooth way to set all of this up, and at times the narrative almost becomes awkward as it jumps back and forth. Every word of this tale, however, is so interesting that reading it is like being swept down rapids --- you're moving so fast and the trip is so thrilling that the occasional bump becomes an expected part of the ride.<br />Nothing though prepares the reader for what the beginning of AVENGER portends. Forsyth is a master gamesman and he sets up a situation whereby it becomes vitally important to the safety and security of the United States that Avenger does not complete his mission. The reader is accordingly on tenterhooks, hoping by turns that Avenger does the job he has been retained to do in order to redress a horrible wrong, yet wishing that those aligned against Avenger will prevent him from doing so.<br />What makes this all the more interesting is that the reader will already know, long before the last page, that Avenger is successful. Forsyth has utilized this technique before. In THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, for instance, everyone knew that the Jackal would fail in his attempt to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. The intriguing aspect of the book was in discovering how he would fail.<br />The mirror element in AVENGER concerns how Avenger will succeed in his own mission, not only with respect to locating his target, but also with respect to abducting him from a seemingly impenetrable fortress and bringing him back to the United States. The answer will keep you reading --- and thinking --- long into the night. But there is more to AVENGER than this intriguing, suspenseful plot. Forsyth sets up a backstory that has so much relevance to today's headlines that after reading AVENGER you'll be unable to watch or read the news without thinking of this novel.<br />AVENGER will not only introduce Forsyth to a new generation of readers but will also have his audience, both old and new, repeatedly revisiting his already extensive bibliography. This is a title to read, discuss and analyze.<br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B00008GKEG|5.0|It's really hard to quibble with this outstanding collection since it contains more archival and performance footage than any previous compilation. While there have been dozens of attempts to tell the Beatles'incredible story throughout the years, this anthology is the most complete. To call it a documentary would be an understatement, there is simply so much history and material here 5 discs almost seem skimpy. For us music lovers, this is a must, the bulk of the Shea Stadium Concert is here (is there a moment more magical than Ed Sullivan introducing the band and watching the kids go berserk when the boys come running out onto the field and take to the stage?), or watching a year later as they perform &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; live, very accurately but clearly very tired (just watch Ringo's face and posture)and one of my favorite sequences, the full clips of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; (check the matching red coats and the new longer hair and mustaches!), the recording sessions for &quot;Get Back&quot; (as a Black man, it's a trip to see my family friend Billy Preston hanging around Twikenham Studios chatting with The Fab Four, but he was there!)right down to the final, very moving clip of &quot;Something&quot; with the guys all cavorting with their wives in some beautiful pastoral settings, no longer a band, but 4 men who have grown up together, conquered the world and are now ready to go their separate ways. We all know that the end of the band wasn't happy or even civil, but this seems an appropriate way to close that particular chapter. The updated recollections by the surviving band members (George's are very poignant, especially now) are priceless since time, history and age have given them fresh perspective and Paul's in depth commentary on their creative process (LP covers, photography, musical direction etc.)is quite candid. The bonus material on disc 5 has become nearly as legendary as the music and film footage on the other discs since it was nearly a decade ago that the entire &quot;Anthology....&quot;project started.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is a straightforward gangster movie, following a potty-mouthed Cuban who attempts to find success in Miami, Florida. The Cuban, named Tony Montana, is beautifuly played by Al Pacino, known for his work in The Godfather series. The plot of Scarface may seem a bit on the generic side, but once you begin to watch the film, a terrific story can be told here. The movie never slows down, with many action sequences, such as the infamous and gory chainsaw scene near the beginning, and many others. You'd be surprised how much ground this fim covers in two and a half hours. And as I said before, Al Pacino does a fantastic job playing a man who wants too much out of life and will do anything to get it. Fans of the Godfather series may find Scarface to be a little too simple, and not convoluted enough. I am a huge fan of both films, and Scarface makes you feel good to be bad. After all, this is a DVD, and no DVD would be complete without extras. The extras to be found here are not going to completely dazzle you, but I got some extra enjoyment out of them. There is one puzzler in the extras, and that is how rappers say that this movie had influenced them to a high degree in their music. Believe me, I am a huge fan of rap and hip-hop. I just don't see how the rap scene quite fits in with Scarface. Rappers would seem to like Training Day better. But whatever the case is, Scarface is an amazing and classic gangster film that most people will get a lot of joy out of, even if it is a little gory or over-the-top every now and then.
B00005MP58|5.0|It definately kept me wanting more just like the book does and I think that it is a VERY good adaptation to the book! Very enjoyable!!! Nobody in the WORLD could ever play Fitzwilliam Darcy like Colin Firth does!!!
B000065U1N|5.0|I had read the book a couple of years prior to the film version's release and had anticipated the release of the movie with unflagging impatience.  If you like non-fiction first person accounts, Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down is definitely worth reading, it makes you really feel for the individuals who participated.  Considering the depth of detail of the book and my mounting anticipation, I had some fears that the movie would not be able to capture the series of events in their entirety as the book had so brilliantly.  Overall I would say that the movie did a fantastic job with the action and incorporating a lot of stories that I would have liked to include, but a review of the original text is mandatory for anyone who enjoyed this movie; as a pair the two do an awesome job of highlighting what an amazing story this is.<br />Please note there are some spoilers in this review.<br />There are some portions of the film version Black Hawk Down's construction however that frustrated me; in particular the casting.  Though Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner are both fine actors, I did not think their placement in this movie was especially warranted.  I have always been bothered by poor imitation accents of any sort, but these are particularly bad examples of false American accents.  Overall I think their failings detract from the audience's ability or at the very least this viewer's ability to be absorbed by the film.<br />Detracting slightly further from this movie was the fact that it was originally scheduled to be released around the same time as the attack was made on the World Trade Center.  The movie was temporarily delayed in its release because it was feared that America would not have the stomach for a film like this given the tragedy that had been visited upon them.  I heard, although I have not confirmed this, that the movie was re-edited to show more of the triumph of the American spirit rather than the disaster that the insertion into \\"the Mog\\" (Mogadishu) was.  This readjustment of the film's tone, I think, if it was in fact made, most likely detracted from the poignancy of the story. Perhaps the film always did carry the strong patriotic undertow; I know it would have been very hard for Director Ridley Scott to gain the incredible support of the US Military that this film received had it not. I will say that in not telling the story exactly as it was I think that the movie does a disservice to the individuals who fought on both sides in October 1993. Again with the amount of material it is very hard to incorporate all of it but there was some material in the film that was revisionist history when the book (which I trust entirely) and the film (which I trust less) are compared.  <br />For example: in the movie the individual who falls from the chopper does so during a unexpected hard maneuver to avoid an RPG, in the book this individual fell because he had way too much equipment and lost his hold on the rope falling some 200' in the process.  The fall from the chopper and the resultant critical patient was the initial event that threw the rhythm of the team off so early and showed that this insertion was FUBAR from start to finish. What I found fascinating in the book which was absent in the movie was how the Somalians figured out how to use a surface-to-surface weapon, the RPG, to down an airborne targets, black hawk helicopters - they dug holes in the streets to absorb the blast from the back of the RPG (which otherwise would burn them if they tried to shoot into the air) and lay down on the ground facing skyward towards the circling helicopters with the end of the RPG in the hole.  I am not sure why they did not include this fact in the movie. <br />Most frustrating is the fact that no mention is given of what brought a good intentioned mission to the point where an entire city was seemingly against the Americans, particularly given the fact that the widely televised landing of the American troops on the beach got very little notice in Somalia. Certain examples of poor PR work which no doubt contributed to the disatisfaction of the Somalis were the chopper pilots who liked to hover over some of the impoverished peoples homes because they found it was amusing when the prop wash literally tore the roofs off these peoples shacks - the same trick also supposedly worked with the women's traditional dress.  True, this should not have resulted in the backfire of a humanitarian mission but certain things like this unfortunately contributed.  I thought it was an oversimplification to show as the movie did that it was only the warlords hired guns Somalian fighters who worked for Khat, a narcotic, who turned out against the Americans.  <br />Anyway, do not get me wrong this is a great movie and it deserves all five of the stars that I gave it. It was a slightly different interpretation of the book than I had made.  I saw the book as a cautionary tale that even the scorpion gets taken down by the ants every once in a while, rather than a confirmation of American might - they got lost in a city and drove in circles getting shot up all day for goodness sake. <br />As a side note please do not get me wrong I support our troops, they do an amazing job but it needs to be recognized that sometimes they fail (and they are allowed to), and I would see this as a failure as well as a triumph. <br />Please enjoy the movie I know I did.

B00005JM4Z|3.0|Fueled by low expectations, 2 Fast 2 Furious (what an awful title) far surpassed its predecessor, exceeding as the movie I expected the original to be. 2F2F has much more action, more outrageous stunts, a plot that I find better suited to this material, and an even sexier cast of scantily-dressed women. For a little over an hour-and-a-half, I was in big-budget, B-movie heaven.<br />Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is no longer with the LAPD, stripped of his badge after the events of the first film. Now in Miami, he makes his earnings through illegal street racing, something that proves to be an easy task for him. But after one particular (and superbly exhilarating) race where he comes out the big winner, he's caught by federal agents and forced to work undercover to nab a powerful drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). <br />They've already got an agent undercover, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), but have yet to pin Verone on anything serious. To infiltrate Verone's empire, O'Connor teams up with old friend and ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson); together, they make for a wild and dangerous driving duo, performing transportation tasks for Verone, including one final assignment that could prove particularly dangerous for O'Connor and Pearce.<br />2F2F, as with most big-budget blockbuster sequels, ups the ante on its predecessor; it's bigger, louder, much faster, and in this case, a whole lot more fun. The race/chase sequences are far more elaborate (unlike the original, when these guys race they actually turn curves and drive pretty long distances, rather than a mere mile-long straight line as in the original) and they're in greater abundance here, a smart move since we're clearly here to watch hardcore automotive stunts, not plot.<br />The story is every bit as dumb as you'd expect from such a lame title, but at least it gives the characters goals and genuine obstacles to overcome (unlike the original, which basically had its &quot;heroes&quot; trying to steal dvd players from trucks in broad daylight). The twists and turns are all easily forseeable (what are the chances Verone won't find out these guys are working undercover?), but the story rarely gets in the way of the action.<br />2F2F boasts three major action setpieces, each of them successively more impressive than the setpiece it follows. The opening race is a doozy and by itself, more exciting than the whole of the first movie. Another race early in the movie puts our heroes (and multiple &quot;tryouts&quot;) in a test to retrive a package in an auto pound 20 miles away, with Walker even driving backwards on the highway at one point. It's the climax that clinched the movie for me, a twenty-minute sequence with cop cars and choppers chasing O'Connor and Pearce, the whole thing concluding with an outrageous but exhilarating stunt between a car and a boat.<br />Even as a B-movie, 2F2F isn't perfect. At a restrictive PG-13, the opportunity for profanity, edgy violence, and nudity is gone. The latter, in particular, is rather irksome. The leading ladies, Eva Mendes and Devon Aoki, are almost as good a reason as all the car stunts to watch the movie. Aoki probably boasts the best-looking body I've seen all year long (a lot of people have criticized her face, but I find it quite uniquely pretty), nice eye candy enhanced by some tight outfights. More screen time for her would have been appreciated.<br />The movie probably could have benefited from the presence of Vin Diesel, but I also have a hard time seeing him fitting into the proceedings. Besides, Walker and Tyrese make an acceptable pairing, the latter of whom delivers an enthusiastically energetic performance. Walker has the straight man role, which is just fine for his rather limited acting skills (though some bad acting on his part is apparent from scene to scene). Cole Hauser makes for a solid villain, and Eva Mendes is strictly eye candy as Walker's love interest (whether or not she's got any talent remains to be seen).<br />2F2F delivers what's expected of it, it may be one of the summer's dumber offerings, but it's undeniably also one of the more thrilling ones, too. If another sequel is ever made (and judging from the box office results, I'd say that's a safe bet), let's hope profanity, edgy violence, and nudity will be thrown into the mix.

I don't think there is any other player in the world who can demonstate the touch and feel which jeff Beck does in every notes he plays. I'd agree that some of the tracks do smack of a producer going overboard with the samples and do question whether this will sound dated in 2-3 years to come but at least its a pleasent change from other instrumental albums simlply being every weird and wonderful scale tacked together being played at a 1000 miles an hour.

B00005RJ1U|2.0|I didn't really have many expectations when I rented Jeepers Creepers.  It's October, and I thought a horror movie would be appropriate.  So, if the chill of mid October inspires you to watch scary movies, you might want to pass on JC and go for something a little better.<br />The movie begins with a brother and sister driving down a desserted country road on their way home from college.  From out of nowhere a terrifying truck appears and nearly runs them off the road.  A jolting experience.  Soon thereafter the brother and sister (Darius and Trish) see the truck parked next to a dilapidated building.  A very sinister looking figure is doing something quite suspicious, and he's not too preoccupied to notice Darry and Trish drive by.  Immediately, the 'Creeper' gets in his truck and eventually runs the two off the road.  Good, so far.  And then it gets lame.<br />Darius insists that the two of them return to the Creeper's apparent home and see what he was up to.  Trish objects, but gives in.  There (the Creeper apparently had other business to attend to and hadn't yet returned) Darius continues to make decisions that will make you yell at the tv in frustration.  Is that good?  There were times when my heart was beating faster than normal, but at the same time I was truly mad about the idiocy of the boy.  And his idiocy and irritating factor never tones down (his character reveals the sophistication of the movie).  After a while I was hoping the Creeper would do him in and get it over with.  The sister, Trish, is likable, and I found myself rooting for her up through the end - I didn't want her to get hurt.  But the slack jawed darius, who's mouth seemed to gape in proportion to his dumbness made the movie too much to bear.  <br />The final scence was also comedic, at least I think.  Maybe it was supposed to be that way, I don't know; it certainly wasn't scary.  Also, the Creeper should have never been shown, at least not in full body shots in ample light.  It was more sinister when he was unknown; being disrobed or unmasked or whatever you want to call it detracted from his creepiness.  <br />Plus (not that the unmasking had everything to do with it), the Creeper was obviously a supernatural being.  Supernatural beings are ok if they're intelligently done, which JC certainly isn't.  For me, being able to identify with the characters and become immersed in the movie, perhaps to the point of feeling like I could be in their shoes or that it could happen to me, is big part of what makes a horror movie scary.  I knew that I would never encounter a supernatural creature the likes of the Creeper; a good horror movie would have manipulated my feelings and thoughts into feeling and thinking that I could have.  But when you rest the weight of your burden on a goof like Darius and get the story rolling with an imbecilic act by the said brother, then it's a good bet you won't succeed.  And Jeepers Creepers doesn't succeed.
B00005QFHG|5.0|This is a rare example of a film even  better than the book, thanks to the magnificent acting of the cast and some slight improvements in where the book needed tightening up. You don't just have to be a chocaholic to enjoy this film - it is life enhancing, fun and simply beautiful to watch!
B00006LLNU|5.0|I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY EXCEPT ANYTIME A BAND SHUTS THEIR MOUTHS AND JUST PLAYS NICE, SWEET, MELLOW, NOSTALGIC MUSIC, I LIKE. I LIKE ALOT.
B00008VPUP|5.0|This is another good, fun, totally enjoyable, delightful and thoroughly wholesome family movie - with the most splendid acting by the famous movie stars who provided the voices for the different characters. This was a great movie for people of all ages when it first came out and it remains so today as a video. Buy it for relatives of all ages and enjoy it yourself!

B000089RVX|5.0|This album can be described in one word: {bleeping] AWESOME!!!<BR>Ok that was 2 words.<br />As a hard rock and metal fan I enjoyed &quot;Fallen&quot;.<BR>Although it was much different then the music I usually listen to.<br />The hard music blended with Amy's beautiful voice and great lyrics made one heck of an album.<br />This cd is a 5 from start to finish, and definitely a must have CD.<br />It offers something for everyone.<BR>Even people who arn't usually fans of the genre.
0553275976|5.0|Perhaps the thing that struck me most about this novel was the fact that even if it was a \\"period\\" piece of the 1980s, it was shockingly similar to the society of the turn of the 21st century, right before the tech-bubble burst.  In 20 years, it amazes me how much--and at the same time how *little*--has really changed.  One might almost expect Sherman McCoy to pull out a miniaturized cell phone to bid on some shares of Enron rather than the Giscard bonds he was involved with.  I felt, reading this book for the first time in the 21st century, that it might as well be the society of today under Mr. Wolfe's satirical scrutiny.<br />The racially, politically charged media circus surrounding his arrest is perhaps now an even more familiar phenomenon than it would have been in the 1980s--something to which we as a society are becoming increasingly numb to.  As the situation grows, and spirals further out of control, Mr. Wolfe makes it increasingly harder on the reader to land squarely on one side or another--on one hand we have the unjust death of a promising Bronx student, and on the other, we have the case being used by various people trying to further their public careers.  One even begins to feel sympathy for the calculating, womanizing Sherman McCoy as his perfectly ordered life comes completely unraveled.  And then we as readers become repulsed by such feelings--which is truly the \\"right\\" feeling in a situation like this?  There is no black or white here (yes, that remark is meant on many levels)--only a confusing, boundless field of grey.  And that seems to be at the core of Mr. Wolfe's purpose in writing this...it is an unflinching look at a society that seems to verge upon the completely amoral.<br />With regards to its \\"unflinching\\" nature, some readers may at first be put off by the extreme bluntness with which Mr. Wolfe tells his story.  Epithets and \\"outdated\\" social and cultural attitudes abound, and Mr. Wolfe doesn't shy away from the harshest, ugliest possible terms for them.  And this very bluntness is perhaps what makes The Bonfire of the Vanities so compelling to me as a reader.  We live in a society that has smothered itself by political correctness--a society where despite seeming openness, the lines of communication are really quite tightly controlled by that strange convention.  To see the veneer of civilization completely ripped away from the society of the 1980s (and, one might imagine, from the very society in which we live now) is at once a repulsive and refreshing experience-- this is perhaps one of the best modern novels I have ever read, fully deserving of its 5 stars.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Ok this move has been under fire since the reviews came in back in May. I want to share my thoughts on the biggest blockbuster (besides those damn fishs)of the year. Nobody realizes that this is a 1/2 a movie. They shot the whole thing at the same time. If the Wachowski brothers could they would have released Revolutions maybe a week or 2 later but those special effects gotta be special. Nobody seems to take this split movie in 1/2 thing seriously. I was relieved to find that ign.com reviewed Kill Bill as only part of a big story and not just a seperate movie. I like to compare Reloaded to X2 because that movie had a lot of foreshadowing. Remember the part when Xavier and Woverine are in Cerebro in the begginng? Wolverine tells him to concentrate harder and X goes &quot;If I did i'd blow his head up&quot; which is what was going to happen at the end of the movie. If the split X2 into two chunks then that scene would be meaningless to you. There is alot alot ALOT od foreshadowing and meaning in Reloaded that should be explained in Revolutions and if its not then I will say: Matrix sucks! But i have confidence in the enigmatic Wachowski brothers that they will come through and on the fateful day of November 5 we will leave the theater going &quot;Whoa!&quot;
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Been longing for a new CD that just makes you wanna go 80 down the freeway?  Yeah, me too.  Look no further.  This album has the kind of pure rock 'n roll that just kicks you in the stomach.  I think a return to this sort of vintage sound is just what the world needed (and this coming from a member of the punk scene!).  It may not be accepted by the teenagers, but anyone over the age of 20 with somewhat distiguishing taste will immediately fall in love.  Thank you Jet for being true to the heart of rock!  Now, come to town so I can see you live!
B000084T18|5.0|I bought this CD because I really enjoyed both 50 Cent songs presented in the 8Mile Movie Soundtrack. I'm a big fan of Eminem, but if 50 isn't better, he's really close to Em. 50 is making Shady Records much better in my opinion, because I don't like Obie Trice.<BR>This album starts with a coin dropping, and this means you haven't wasted your money, because you are about to listen to some wild tunes.<BR>My favorite songs are &quot;In Da Club&quot; (plays a lot in the radio, even here in Brazil), &quot;P.I.M.P&quot; (I knew this song from the MTV Video Music Awards 2003), &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; (featuring Eminem, who sings a totally wild rhyme, it's Em at his best in here), &quot;Many Men&quot; (this song talks a little more about the nine shots 50 got, incluiding one in the face) and &quot;21 Questions&quot; (something like a romantic song featuring Nate Dogg in the chorus), even though all the tracks are great.<BR>If you're into hip hop, then you must really get this CD, and if you're not, I really think you should be. 50 is one of the best rappers ever, without doubt.... Maybe &quot;less good&quot; than Eminem, Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac...<BR>Anyways, this CD is a total masterpiece of hip hop, buy it now. If you don't like cussing, f*ck you! Lol... Just kidding... If you don't like cussing buy the Clean version and have fun.. Peace out!

B0000CD5I6|5.0|For 25 years, my favorite Jethro Tull albums have been &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;-and no other two records have had such a cumulative effect on my musical, perhaps cultural, interests.  The only contenders in the vast scope would be two from Frank Sinatra or Louis Armstrong, but even these fall behind somewhere.<BR> Of course, I've loved a lot of subsequent Tull, especially &quot;Stormwatch,&quot; &quot;Broadsword and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Roots to Branches,&quot; all of them fabulous fusions of rock, blues and ethnic folk.  But I waited 25 years for something as fantastic as &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album.&quot;  It is a perfect Tull record, particularly impressive released right on the heels of Ian Anderson's superb solo album &quot;Rupi's Dance.&quot;  <BR> More than 20 years ago, I compiled my own \\"Jethro Tull Christmas Album,\\" on a cassette I always played on Christmas Eve and, occasionally, at other points during the year.  The collection was added to at various times, whenever Anderson decided to release another Yuletide-oriented number.  Sometime during my 20-plus years of corresponding with and meeting Ian after gigs, I actually mentioned the subject of a Tull Christmas record.  Honest, I did!<BR> Well, it's here-and a real Yuletide gift-and (like so many Tull records) unique.  Unlike the usual Christmas offerings from pop musicians who slog through the old songs with the same tired, syrupy arrangements, the material on &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; is eminently suited to the style and strengths of the band.  My love of traditional British Isles music (engendered in large part by Tull back in the `70s) has always hankered for such a trad-oriented Tull album, mixing the ancient sounds with jazz, blues and rock-as only the Tull lads can do-and in abundance on this record.<BR> When Tull recorded new arrangements of some of their classics in 1993, the results were interesting and welcomed, but a bit varied.  (I do love the remake of \\"My God,\\" in particular-due in part to \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" turning up in mid-tune.)  The fresh arrangements of the \\"old\\" Tull numbers on Christmas Album are all superb; and both \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow\\" and \\"Weathercock\\" improve on the originals.<BR> As always, Andrew Giddings contributes substantially and brilliantly.  The versions played anew by the current band consistently benefit from Andy's recreations of the earlier Tull keyboardists' sounds merged with his own prowess, inventiveness and taste.  His work on \\"Jack Frost\\" is reminiscent of a traditional British brass band; and his take on David Palmer's original portative organ on the new \\"Weathercock\\" is stunning.  This track, for me, is the highlight of the album-and one that nearly captures the feeling of live Tull.  \\"Weathercock\\" has always been a personal favorite, but the new version adds a heap of power and majesty to the sublime beauty of the 1978 track.  (This version may overtake \\"Acres Wild\\" as my all-time top Tull track.)<BR> \\"Weathercock\\" and \\"Jack Frost\\" also benefit from Martin Barre's legendary style, as does the rearranged (again!) \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman.\\"  Anderson's other innovative instrumental arrangements of traditional English carols-\\"Holly Herald\\" (\\"Holly and the Ivy,\\" a lovely tune, and \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\") and \\"We Five Kings\\" (\\"We Three Kings\\" in 5/4 time, reminiscent of \\"Living in the Past\\" and vintage Dave Brubeck)-are equally fresh and charming, as are the exquisite \\"Pavane\\" and the umpteenth rearrangement of \\"Bouree,\\" this time done primarily in, not a swing, but a blues, tempo.<BR> My old pal, \\"Honest\\" Dave Pegg, even turns up on two tracks that he sometimes played with the band during his 16-year tenure-\\"A Christmas Song\\" and \\"Another Christmas Song.\\"  Anderson's son, again billed as James Duncan, provides an economical percussive contrast to the powerful stylings of good ol' Doane Perry; and Andy Giddings plays bass, too, when Jonathan Noyce goes missing from time to time.  There are also some very good new Ian Anderson songs, especially \\"First Snow on Brooklyn,\\" featuring the Sturcz String Quartet (who contributed wonderfully to Rupi's Dance) and \\"Last Man at the Party\\" (with references to curried goat and Frank Sinatra!), and even a Martin Barre original, \\"A Winter Snowscape,\\" which also is featured (sans Anderson's flute) on his solo album Stage Left.<BR> Three new albums from the Tull chaps in short order is a treasure trove indeed.  Thanks, guys-for making Christmas come a little early this year.  (The old cassette is no more!)
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I believe that everyone posting here is a true Enigma fan, and perhaps, Enigma's music has affected us all in different ways from the start.  I was hooked by the debut in 1990, and have been a loyal fan since.  MCMXC a.D. is a top 20 CD in my collection, The Cross of Changes is a worthy successor, and E3 and E4 continue the legacy with some classic Enigma sounds.  I think that Voyageur should've been released under the Michael Cretu moniker, not Enigma.  With the exception of the familiar new age synth-horn loop intro, the rest of the album is a huge mystery.  Forgettable songs, embarrasing lyrics, and no Sandra to be found anywhere.  I can assure you that this album will age poorly.  Some of the synths and effects are just downright primitive-sounding (without sounding &quot;classic&quot;), and there are no memorable melodies or rhythms anywhere on this disc.  This is a major disappointment for me, as a new Enigma album has, in the past, been a big deal to me.  This release catapults Enigma into the realm of mediocrity.  I cannot recommend this release to anyone, except completists.  Sad, but true.
0553277472|4.0|Is the book worth reading? Yes.  Would I have read it if not required to? No.  How much did I learn? A lot.  Would I recommend it? Absolutely.<BR> The book is long; there is not doubt about that.  Someone asked me that if I saw Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance on the shelf, would I pick it up?  No, I wouldn't pick up the book and read it.  Because I was required to read it, I was forced to look beyond my pre-conceived notions to realize there are some merits to the book.  The book gives insight into the values of one very confused man.  The great part about it is that as he works through his past, you work through it as well.  It can be frustrating to try and understand the jumbled thoughts, but read it with the realization that it all works out in the end.  <BR> There is one quote in Chapter One that stuck with me throughout the book:  \\"Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands, disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum.  Some channel deepening seems called for.\\"  That is what the book is about, deepening Robert's understanding of himself and his relationship with his son.  If you're open-minded enough, you can learn a little about yourself as well.  Even if all I got were new ways of looking at things and gaining appreciation of different aspects of my life, it was worth it.
B00006IU73|5.0|Among various &quot;neo-progressive&quot; bands on both sides of the Atlantic, Porcupine Tree is a name criminally undersung, especially next to Spock's Beard or the Flower Kings. They have the advantage of being far more tuneful and catchy than the former while a good deal more focused than the latter; the result is a band that plays lush, experimental pop (think Beatles, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; Beach Boys, Radiohead), bolstered by muscular art-rock workouts and layered with neo-psychedelica and ambient flourishes. &quot;Trains&quot; could easily have been a hit song for R.E.M. while &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; is the ultimate blend of prog-metal thunder and summery avant-pop with a killer hook. The soaring choruses of &quot;...Muzak&quot; send shivers up my spine, while the haunting, icy &quot;Lips of Ashes&quot; combines Crosby-Stills&amp;Nash harmonies with a soaring Floydian guitar solo. &quot;Gravity Eyelids&quot; is possibly the most unnerving, cathartic song on the disc, with an eerily &quot;goth&quot;-like spiraling chorus and atmospherics that rival any of Coldplay's moodier moments. The band as a whole is quite solid; Colin Edwin on bass keeps a rock-solid groove with a McCartney-esque sense of melody, while his rhythm section counterpart Gavin Harrison on drums is the busiest member of the band, sounding a lot like Spock's Beard's Nick D'Virgilio. Richard Barbieri's ambient collages put Eno to shame, and his mellotron usage is much more tasteful and sparing than many neo-prog keyboardists. Steven Wilson himself is a triple-threat. He sings in an incredibly Beatles-like voice with the range of Thom Yorke but thankfully minus his speech impediment, and plays some of the most wonderfully depressing piano you'll ever hear. His guitar work is a true joy, though--combining grinding, atonal, odd-metered Frippian riffage with unexpectedly soaring, lyrical, bluesy leads one might expect from Peter Green. If you haven't climbed this Tree before, do so at once, because this album may only be at your local record store...in absentia.

0385504209|1.0|I love mysteries and thought that this would be a good one since it starts in the Louvre. Was I wrong. As a Christian I take exception with the author making Jesus a mere mortal and saying that his divinity was made up by the Catholic church. Also what was all that junk about Mary Magdalene being a goddess and the wife of Jesus. There is only one God and the goddess bit is just new age stuff. Is the author a new age junkie?  I wish someone would explain why Christianity is the only religion debunked and belittled in books. I gave it one star because it could have been a good mystery. But this will be the last book I will ever read by Dan Brown. I am glad I didn't waste the money on it. Thank God for libraries.

Once you pick up this book, you will not only be unable to put it down, but you stand a good chance of quitting your job and retraining as a Mathematician!<br />Few books of any genre are as captivating and riveting as Singh's Fermat's Enigma. To find a book this exceptional about a subject that many find boring is truly wonderful. It reads like a suspenseful detective novel with substance. I started reading it while night-skiing on a mountain in Canada. It was so good that I just had to take it on the slopes in my pack. I read by moonlight every time I was on the chairlift until it was done. You just can't put this book down!<br />I have bought a copy for almost everyone I know, and many people I don't.

0345451325|4.0|Ok.To the point. I never played Halo yet. Then after I saw a novel about Halo:Fall of Reach..I usually call Video Game Novel &quot;Book Crisis..Dont Read&quot; (A rule number7 towards Borders or Barnes And Nobles).Seeing everyones review I needed to prove them wrong dat this book is another horrible book.. I slammed into my computer,Spent 3 dollars and then snapped the box open and ripped out the book from the Box.. Then read it like an maniac so I can prove everyone that this book stunk..From this point I proved myself wrong..This isnt a Walkthrough of a videogame or neither TIPS AND CHEATS..Its a Story about a Spartan Super Soldier. and tells you every aspect about the games prequal.. This is a book that you can eat off of. When I looked at it I got hooked..bad..<BR> Then it just took me in another world where Alians are attacking and Humans injured in towards a cinematic where you go dizzy with emotional touches..Even thou it has some few boring scripts it was a suck it up book..<br /> At the end..I proved myself wrong..
B000002UAI|3.0|And it shows.  From the cover(where George and Paul especially) look the worse for wear, to the large number of cover songs.  At the time the Beatles were constantly touring, giving television and radio interviews, making a film and other public apperances and yet they had to honor their EMI contract and produce yet another disc.  With all that was going on the boys were obviously short of original material.  Contrast this disc with their previous effort--\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in which all the songs were written by The Beatles.  Here, only 8 of 14 are credited to the boys.  The disc starts off with the acoustic \\"No Reply\\" and although the song has an interesting bridge its pretty uneventful.  \\"I'm A Loser\\" shows John's writing growing and becoming more introspective.  Once again, an acoustic number with some nice country picking by George.  \\"Baby's in Black\\" comes next and this song really highlights the boys vocal skills well.  Although the song itself, like others on this disc, doesn't prove to be too memorable.  \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" is the boys first cover and if you have to cover somebody it might as well be Chuck Berry.  The boys do a yeoman effort and Lennon comes up with a strong vocal, but the song fails to be a classic in the way that their version of \\"Roll over Beethoven\\" was.  \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" is a gorgeous song by Paul.  A nice uncluttered acoustic arrangement augmented by Ringo's bongoes with great harmonizing.  Great job.  \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is just not good.  It has no redeemable qualities so lets move on.  \\"Kansas City(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!)\\" is a piece of joyous music making that harkens back to their early head shaking days.  Lennon's chunky rhythm guitar drives the song irresistibly forward.  \\"Eight Days a Week\\" is the highlight from this set.  The obvious single from this disc, it features a fade-in and some nice singing from Lennon.  \\"Words of Love\\" the Buddy Holly song is handled skillfully by the Beatles.  Excellent interplay between George and John on electric guitars and great harmonizing by the three singers make this an underrated Beatles classic.  \\"Honey Don't\\" is Ringo singing this rockabilly song by Carl Perkins.  After listening to Ringo sing it, one has to believe he had a better version of the song in him than what he sings here.  \\"Every Little Thing\\" is another one of those song on here that are okay but just fall short of being good.  \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\" has more introspective Lennon lyrics and countrish guitar playing by George.  It also boasts a nice tune with some good backing vocals.  \\"What You're Doing\\" is another tune that you won't remember for long after you've played this disc.  \\"Everybody's Trying to be My Baby\\" is, like \\"Mr Moonlight,\\" simply a mistake.  I don't know what the idea was, to see how much reverb could be put on George's voice or give him the song with the worst set of lyrics ever.  A note here:  A surprising thing about this set is the countrish guitar pickings displayed by George, especially after the previous disc. Also, another item to point out is that the bulk of this album is acoustic.  To be sure The Beatles stumbled here, but that would only make their coming discs that more amazing.and John on electric guitars and great harmonizing by the three singers make this an underrated Beatles classic.  \\"Honey Don't\\" is Ringo singing this rockabilly song by Carl Perkins.

B000002H70|5.0|I don't even know where to start......This album will forever be considered &quot;MY&quot; favorite of ALL TIME!!!! To the good people out there who are thinking of buying this cd....DO IT!!!!! I've listened to this album so many times that it's actually starting to wear out. A cd wearing out you ask??? It's true....All I need to do is listen to &quot;prayers for rain&quot;, &quot;disentegration&quot;, &amp; &quot;the same deep water as you&quot;.

B00000ILDE|5.0|This is a brilliant film by James Cameron, who seems to have a natural talent for making some of the humans worse than the Aliens. If you haven't seen it, there's even one scene in which you find yourself rooting for the Aliens themselves, and you die hard fans know what I'm talking about. I hate the term timeless but this movie really is, and were it not for the antiquated computer screens you see all over the place, everyone and their grandmother would have a hard time telling when this film was made. The cinematography is top notch, the script is outstanding, the characters are so real you think you know them, and the emotional adrenaline refues, in most places, to let you get up and pee. You're like &quot;Yeah, Yeah, Get em!&quot; and &quot;Don't take no crap!&quot; and &quot;Oh, my dear sweet God--No!&quot; Though the whole movie. Enjoy.
B000003TAR|5.0|Let's face it.  While Nevermind was revolutionary to mainstream music, it got old fast.  The songs are so poppy, it's hard to stomach after multiple listens.  Compared to Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Superunknown, and Alice in Chain's Dirt, Nevermind was a joke.  But THIS album, In Utero, is amazing.<br />All of the songs are completely different, ranging from slow, muddy, distorted numbers, to mellow, emotional releases, to fast spurts of punk rock chaos.  If your favorite songs on Nevermind were &quot;Breed&quot;, &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;, and &quot;Something in the way&quot;, this album is for you.<br />If you dislike Nirvana because of Nevermind, or were turned off by its poppiness and criminal overrating, get this album to see the REAL Nirvana in all its ugly, distorted glory.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Oh, but how the dark nature of man can be. This is a movie of furious complexity and like all things complex, it is wonderfully simple. It makes one wonder; can we change? Or should we just accept what we are? There is a strong pull towards darkness here, one that is strong because it's so terrifying and so enticing. Unforgiven implies that violence will be the only path, if we don't just forgive and move on. This movie is an unabashed look at how difficult it is to be an enlightened human being, about how difficult the struggle to be good really is, about how one small and simple pull awry, can un-do years and years and years of walking along the straight and narrow path.
B000003TA4|2.0|Ugh.  This album gets my vote for most overrated album ever.  While it's true that it was revolutionary and changed the face of mainstream music forever, it's still not that great of an album.  <br />The songs are extremely poppy and pleasing to the ears on the first few listens, but this gets old really fast.  How many times can a human being take &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot;?  The album hasn't aged well at all, and there are and have been many, many, MANY bands with the same type of sound as Nirvana who can pull it off a million times better.<br />Many people claim this as the album that destroyed bad hair metal and reshaped the course of rock.  &quot;Pffft,&quot; is what I say.  The only thing this album gave us is those stupid, pseudo-angsty nu-metal bands (Staind, KoRn, Trapt, Chevelle, Seether) that are clogging the air waves and are the bane of real music fans everywhere.<br />If you're looking for some REAL grunge/alternative, pick up Surfer Rosa by the Pixies.  This is the album that Kurt was trying to ape when he recorded this pile of dung.  Even compared to other grunge bands of Nevermind's time (Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains), the album is a joke.  <br />Don't give In Utero the skip, though.  Kurt quickly realized what a monster he'd created with Nevermind and decided to record a REAL album.  The result was In Utero.  THAT album gets 5 stars.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok so maybe it is hard to come out with a 2nd album after creating something as amazing as Hybrid Theory but some how LP did it! although this cd may not be as great as Hybrid theory its still an awesome creation. songs are short but very goot.<br />Don't Stay 9/10- Definitley a better opener than Hybrids &quot;Papercut&quot; great for any number track.

B00005JM0B|5.0|Is no on else glad there is a fresh perspective? I won't rehash the story. Many here have done that. This is a great treatment and a worthy installment to the series. Great effects, but thankfully, the camera doesn't linger on them. Great action and cast. Good story and a fresh take on the series. I saw it twice!
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album is absolutely awesome, and has something for everyone. It brings together R&amp;B, Rap, and Jazz with socially conscious lyrics. There is not a single song that I don't like on it.  Fergie, the newcomer to this group, definately adds a new feel to this album.<BR>1) Hands up - a high energy start to the album.  The saxophone on this song is very jazzy, and has the whole song has a bit of a retro feel.<BR>2) Labor Day - Pure Fun.  You can really dance to this song.<BR>3) Let's Get Retarded - This song starts out by saying that it means no disrespect (look up the lyrics if you're concerned about it)  Actually, it uses &quot;retarded&quot; to describe losing control of your body when you dance.  Anybody who listens to more than just the chorus of this song would realize this.<BR>4) Hey Mama - Has a latin, almost jamaican, feel.  Sounds a little like Sean Paul's &quot;Get Busy.&quot;  Fun song.<BR>5) Shut Up - Fergie shines on this song!  More pop sounding than the rest of the album, but it still has a groove.  Fergie's vocals alone make this song worth listening to. Beautiful.<BR>6) Smells like Funk - This also has a retro feel to it.  Nothing particularly spectacular about this song, but it's still solid.<BR>7) Latin Girls - Very latin feel to this one.  Another fun song to dance to.<BR>8) Sexy - Funktastically Beautiful Song.  They did a nice job mixing the piano into this slower song.<BR>9) Fly Away - This song is my absolute favorite - Fergie really shines on this one.  A wonderfully free song... you just have to hear it.<BR>10) The Boogie that Be - Mostly rap, with a classic sound to it.<BR>11)  The Elephunk Theme - An exotic song, with melodies that sound middle-eastern or Indian, blended with aggressive rap.<BR>12) The Apl Song - An calming song, with beautiful melodies.<BR>13) Anxiety - Aggressive rap on top of a some rocking guitar.<BR>14) Where is the Love - This is a little longer than the radio cut.<BR>15) Hidden Track - I don't know what this oneis called, but it's a nice song.  It's slow, soft, and sexy with rap verses blended into a melodic chorus.
B00005RZV4|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. FINALLY a LIVE NIN CD. I bought this one a little late cuz I didn't have any money for quite some time, so sadly I missed out on purchasing the Deluxe Edition, including the bonus &quot;Still&quot; disc, which I suppose I'll just have to order or something...but yes, this cd is, as always, nothing short of amazing. It almost doesn't even sound live, as if Trent went in and totally re-did the songs. Half of the cd is off of The Fragile and the rest are some of the best off of TDS, PHM, and Broken. I don't need to bother to go into detail how awesome this is, you should already understand. The only possible letdown is if this whole concert isn't two cd's long. It would have been cool to hear something like &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; or even &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; on here, or even &quot;Reptile&quot; which is actually a hidden feature on the DVD, and definitely be sure to pick that one up too, it's just breathtaking. You are not a NIN fan if you don't own this, bottom line.
B000099T2L|3.0|The first songs are very good!<BR>The overplayed Crazy in love.<BR>The sexy song Naughty girl.<BR>The smash hit Baby Boy (Ft Sean Paul)<BR>Hip Hop Star (Ft Big Boi &amp; Sleepy Brown)<BR>Ecxept from that 4 songs, the other are ballads!!!<BR>Where are Beyonce sexy tracks!?<BR>Be with you, Signs are the best ballads, Me, myself &amp; I (the third single is ok)<BR>But Beyonce shows that she needs a rapper to create a cool song!<BR>Where are the fast melodies!<BR>But her voice is amazing, so, that 4 tracks at first, be wiht you and signs<BR> She deserves  3 stars! (her voice is the best and I love her)<BR>but I was waiting for more!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2: X-men united is buy far the best marvel sequal to any marvel film currently out besides Blade 2. In my opinion this film totally dwarfs the first one by a long shot.I mean more action, more characters, and Wolverine is seriously ruthless in it than the first.This is a must-have for any fan of the x-men film and for fans who just love action.
0385512104|5.0|We are all familiar with the autistic child; the concern with detail, the high mathematical skill, the complex logical thinking, the low level of coping with society, the groaning, the withdrawals. What is unique about THE CURIOUS INCIDENT ETC. is that it is written from the point of view of the child himself.  Mark Haddon has written a fast paced, fascinating story around Christopher Boone and what happens after he finds a dead dog impaled by a pitchfork in the neighbor's yard. The plot takes you down some very unexpected roads, and by the time you reach the suspenseful climax you are thinking, feeling and experiencing the frustrations of autism.<BR>I for one became a little glassy eyed during the lists and the mathematical explanations, but they are a part of Christopher's mind and I just slipped lazily through them (part of my mind).  At any rate, they add to the picture which is over all delightful.  Highly recommended.
0385504209|1.0|In my opinion, this is a heretical book to be avoided by Christians. If anyone read this book and thinks that it holds any answers to life, I strongly encourage you to read the bible for yourself and see that the Dan Brown's words are like an open grave. Dan's main purpose is to cast doubt on the validity of the Christian faith. He does so by attacking the authenticity of the bible, casting doubt on the Church, and suggesting an alternative spiritual philosophy to Christianity.<br />In his attempt to attack the authenticity of the bible, Dan ridicules the canonization process, making it seem that a group of men came together and picked their favorite four gospels while they discarded over 40 other candidates. This is completely inaccurate, and it is only in a work of fiction that these lies can be presented as truth. In reality, the canonization process took many years, and the ones selected were chosen on three important tenants. 1) The book must have been written by or sponsored by the 12 Apostles of Christ. 2) The content should not contradict the teachings of Christ and 3) It must have been accepted by and widely used by many Churches. Dan also claims that Emperor Constantine heavily influenced the canonization of the Bible. In fact, he had nothing to do with their canonization, and there is sufficient historical documentation to support that assertion.<br />Why would Dan make these outrageous claims if they are completely false? Dan does not believe as Jewish and Christian scholars believe that God has worked through his faithful people to evaluate, treasure, and collect the Sacred Writings that manifest God's will and purpose into Sacred Collections.<br />Dan's second purpose is to cast doubt on the Christian Church. He does so by picking on a very vulnerable denomination, the Catholic Church. While a few individuals in the Catholic church have been guilty of wrongs, largely publicized, and denounced by the body as a whole, even he is not able to completely vilify the Church because the acts represent less than one thousandth of one percent of faithful and Godly men of the Church through out the ages. So Dan has to pick on one fringe group of the Church, which is not at all representative of the body as a whole. In the end, Dan decides to exonerate his characters and the Church, but not after trashing them for over 420 pages.<br />Dan cites wrongs the Church committed throughout history (his charges again inaccurate and unsubstantiated). Claiming the Church was so powerful in the First Century they were able to stamp out anything they didn't agree with, including \\"divine femininity.\\" In reality, the Church suffered horrible persecution with its members subjected to torture and every horrible painful death imaginable. Yet the church continued to flourish, deeply rooted in the doctrine of the Apostles, and watered with the blood of millions of members. With all this repression, why would such a practice grow if it were not fulfilling? If you have never explored Christianity with an open mind, I invite you to set aside your prejudices and do so.<br />The books final point, after casting doubt on the authenticity of the Bible and vilifying the Church is to promote an alternative spiritual path. To me, this \\"sacred femininity\\" is the most disturbing aspect of this book.  Dan suggests that orgy sex, astrology, tarot cards and the worship of other human beings, as gods is as acceptable of a practice for gaining spirituality as the Christian faith. He suggests that sexuality between men and women was an acceptable way of worshiping God before Christ came along, and that Christ participated in this practice, and it was the Church that stamped out this practice because they wanted to suppress the power of women. This is complete and utter nonsense!<br />The Bible makes a reference to Dan's \\"sacred femininity,\\" warning us not to have anything to do with the practice:<br />I have this against you: You tolerate that woman, who callsherself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. I will strike her children dead. Revelation 2:20-23 (NIV)<br />According to the Bible, the reason the teachings of the \\"divine femininity\\" have not survived is because God finds it detestable and wiped out the practice. Dan would have us believe it was the Church who eliminated the practice, but clearly that is not the case.<br />In summary, this is a trashy book with thin character development and a difficult to follow story line. It's your traditional boy meets girl, boy and girl get in trouble, and boy gets girl plot. The story is just a thin cover for Dan's pulpit of presenting his agnostic views and casting doubt on the Christian faith. Only in a fiction book could he get away with his outrageous claims, and only in these days would people read this filth and swallow it as truth.<br />Christians, I urge you to skip reading this book, Dan should not receive any support from the Saints for his heretical views. If you did read this book and were intrigued by his philosophy, I urge you to read the New Testament of the Bible and make an informed decision for yourself. Dan himself even says that Jesus was an important spiritual leader. The problem in Dan's statement is Jesus said \\"I am the way and the truth and the light, no man may come before God the Father except through ME.\\" Either Jesus was a complete liar, or he was the Son of God. Jesus doesn't leave any room for a middle ground.lls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.

When you've done that come back and have a good read from someone else's perspective. This books abilities lie in it's veiwpoint from someone else's perspective, not your's. Remember you are reading someone else's understanding of philosophy and you will be entertained, take it literally and to heart and you will throw it thru a wall.
0385504209|5.0|This was one of the best, if not THE best book, I've ever read!  Mr. Brown has obviously done his research.  The book is VERY interesting and thought-provoking as well as just being a good read.  I've loaned my book out to my friends and they've commented on just how good of a book it is and how much they enjoy it.  You don't want to put the book down!  I HIGHLY recommend this book.  You won't be sorry.
6301972201|5.0|Well - this is Judy at the top of her beauty and moviefame. Tatseful color and design by her husband-2-be Vincente Minnelli... he really is an echo of William Wyler and Billy Wilder with MUSIC!:-)<br />The film is family-nostalgia and intimate family values - a popular trend when the World is dark(wars, catastrophies etc.<br />When I first saw it I disliked that it didn`t gave a plot, but incidents... Over the years however I have come 2 love it - and it TOO has become nostalgia for me...
B00006L83N|5.0|This was the second Symphony X album that I purchased, and it is completely amazing. V was the first album I got by them, because it was highly recommended. I was a little disappointed by V because it was mostly slow paced and there were no songs that really stuck out. However, Odssey completely redeemed them, it is very fast and quite heavy. Every song on this album is great, and the title song is a masterpiece of progressive metal. Russel doesn't over do the vocal harmonies like he does in V. It just never gets old. In my opinion they are the best progressive metal around.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I am speechless... this is the most beautiful thing i have heard in a very long time.  tell everyone you know or will listen to you to get this.  if i sound obsessed ... well i am.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|This album falls extremely short of the Mer de Noms.  Billy Howerdel had a brainchild on the burners for a decade and made something incredible, this new album feels rushed and lopsided.  It basically sounds like Maynard and the A Perfect Circle band where they used to have riveting and cohesive crescendos and decrescendos, but now its just background music and Maynard loving himself and painting that sex-obsessed tortured rock star narcissistic drama queen portrait of himself..  The first track is a powerful one, and it seems to be the most truthful track in terms of maynard's lyrics and his centricism, but it rears its head, and then lingers for too long meandering about pointlessly, which is what the majority of the album feels like.  Billy is the brain behind the band, perhaps he needs to take his time and remember his roots is all, perhaps reclaim center stage in terms of production..  while maynard's at shows getting stagehands to find &quot;single girl&quot;-s for him, there's not much to say, surely talented but perhaps too confident these days.  I miss the violins, and the arranged feel of a perfect circle, where maynard's lyrics flow with dramatic theatrical emotional guitar powered by Howerdel..  instead of the quiet fingerpicking behind maynard's voice like a lounge act.  Still a fan, but a bit disappointed, I'd like to hear the instruments do more; one thing that is significant is that Mer de Noms would hold up without the voice layer..  that just isn't so, here.
B000002UDB|5.0|Although tainted by some of the more excessive elements of the psychedelic culture of the 60's, Magical Mystery Tour is packed with great Beatles classics and a few great lesser known tunes.  The main problem with the album itself is that it wasn't really made as an album, but more of a collection of singles, Sgt. Pepper leftovers and B-sides to back up the movie.  With that said, I must point out that the Beatles scraps and leftovers are better than almost any other band's feast.  There are really only three weak tracks here: the instrumental 'Flying,' McCartney's &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; and George Harrison's trippy and silly 'Blue Jay Way'  The rest of the album is pure gold!  'Hello, Goodbye' and 'Penny Lane' are McCartney at his best writing sweet, well-crafted and endlessly catchy songs.  'The Fool on The Hill' also ranks up there with Paul's best ballads.  'Baby, You're a Rich Man' is a great song that is usually not heard on radio or greatest hits packages. 'Strawberry Fields Forever' was released as a single with 'Penny Lane' on the B-side as a preview to a Beatles starved public for the Sgt. Pepper album what they had been working on for the past year and frankly both songs are so good that its amazing that they were left off of the finished product.  Bottom line:  while its not the best Beatles album by a longshot, its still contains great Beatles songs and is not to be passed on.
B000023VR6|5.0|At first, i thought Dr. Dre would be like many rapper who fall of their game on their sophomore album. But Dr. Dre was still doing his thing. The production on this album is amazing, even better than The Chronic's. Dr. Dre's lyric is also well put together not just some rushed albums that the DOWN SOUTH record labels produces and all you hear is CAsh, Money, Hoes, Cars, Chains, Chrystal, and stuff like that...Dr. Dre is also good at bringing young game into rap (Snoop DOgg, WArren G, Kurrupt, Daz Dilliger, Nate Dogg) and now the WHITE AMERICAN DREAM EMINEM. They guest apperances are also superb on this album. Unlike NO LIMIT, Dr. Dre picks his guest apperances wisely eventhough they both have alot. The quality of this CD is definitely worth the money!
B00006IUL7|5.0|Insomnia is the second outing from director Christopher Nolan (Memento) and, while not as thrilling and innovative as his first movie, its still an taut thriller in the film noir tradition.<br />The plot centers around a detective (Al Pacino) sent from LA up to Alaska to solve a brutal murder.  A bright, but naive young local detective (Hilary Swank) helps him search for clues.  While searching in the Alaskan wilderness Pacino's character accidentally kills his partner and covers it up.  The problem is that the actual murderer (Robin Williams) saw Pacino do this.  A &quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; game between Pacino and Williams ensues.<br />Pacino is excellent as a detective burdened from past sins and the constant daylight of northern Alaska.  Williams is also brilliant as a mild-mannered author who in a split second, turned into cold, calculating killer.  Its a needed departure from his spastic comedy and hokey &quot;coming-of-age&quot; dramas.  Swank is good too(especially at the film's climax), but unfortunately under used.  The plot kind of relies a bit heavy on too many film-noir/corrupt cop conventions, but it still makes those cliches seem fresh.  It is also interesting to see how both Pacino's and Williams' characters begin their path to ruin by rationalizing their deeds as being done for the greater good, but end up trapped in a lie after lie.  Bottom line: a great movie that stands head and shoulders above most movies released in the studio system.
B0000B3B95|1.0|First, worse superhero movie since Power Rangers The Movie. Second thing is the movie made me very nausius becasue they were contsatly splitting the screens in more then three views at a time. Third, They made a mivie made for kids WAY over dramatic. Fourth, In SPider-man after 10 mins Peter is already turning into spiderma. In Hulk it took like 45 mins for bruce just to get exposed to radiation. Fifth, HUlk looked WAY to cartoony. Sixth, There was not enough hulk smash. And finally, I couldn't wait to leave the theater. HUlk was disapointment.
B00006690G|4.0|Its not as good as THE SLIM SHADY LP,or THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP.When I first got this CD I probably would have said it was Eminem's best,but now after I have had it for almost a year and a half,I think it's his worst.The best songs are square dance,white amerisa,sayin' goodbye to hollywood,and sing for the moment.Em's lyrics arent the best,but his beats are off da hook.Anyway if you want Eminem's best efforts get either THE SLIM SHADY LP,or THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|If there's redemption in this movie, it is for the viewer!<br />Each and every character in this film has his or her motive for doing the things that lead up to the brilliant finale.  And those motives aren't forgiveness or redemption.  They're self-indulgent.<br />These motives are often explored simultaneously and work in conduction with one another.<br />There's no virtue. Neither behind the badge nor the gun!  The chain of events in this film lead to small revelations for the characters, but each of them knows that it's too late to act on them.<br />Life and circumstance have tainted them and they can't forgive nor be forgiven!<br />This is the straw extended to the viewer - forgiveness depends on how you forgive those...<br />This is what makes this a great film!
0783243499|3.0|starts out great and ends great. though the people around Patrick Bateman really get what they deserve. the movies sorta let down by the combination of slayings and comedy. dont mix. can Bale be any prettier and he sounds so calm and then he breaks out into the psycho he is. favorite part has got to be the chainsaw part when Bale drops it and then goes AHHHHHH!!! with blood on his face, though did he have to put his running shoes on
0380789035|4.0|I went into this book with high expectations. I had just finished Coraline and Neverwhere and was amazed at Gaiman's skill. Especially in Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett). However, this book seemed to run on for far to long. About 3/4 the way through it really started to drag and I almost quit before finishing it.<br />However, I struggled through. I can't say what I thought of the ending. It was certainly something I didn't expect, but I didn't find it satisfying for some reason.<br />I think this book would have been helped considerably by finding a way to cut about 100 pages. However it's still an excellent book.

B00008EY9G|5.0|I remember the anticipation I had just seeing the previews of this movie.  I gotta say the movie definitely lived up to my expectations, and believe me, I don't give a lot of FIVE star ratings!<br />Identity tells the story of 10 strangers stuck in a motel.  One by one these strangers are slowly being murdered.  Now the survivors must unravel the clues to what brought them all together, who the killer is, and the connection they all share.  <br />A great mystery suspense thriller.  I love it when a movie puts in a taste of mystery in its storyline, and this film is nothing short of mysteries.  The twist and turns, and complete 360's of this movie can only be compared to a Six Flags roller coaster ride.  This movie brilliantly also tries to give hints through out its course, making the viewers go &quot;Ohhhhhh, I see...&quot; especially the second time through.  The title of the movie is a big clue in itself.  Definitely worth seeing twice, especially the extended version of this film which comes in the DVD version.  The ending was probably one of the more intelligent/brilliant endings I've ever seen, and really have to be appreciated.  There was also a little bit of Pulp Fiction-esque cinematography, especially in the beggining, which was done nicely.<br />With great acting, an all-star cast, good writing, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, Identity has all the ingredients for a great mystery thriller.  Watching it with friends is definitely recommended!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This score would best be described as a powerful musical romp.  The movie was outstanding (Grammy award for Depp anyone??) and the score surely does it justice.  <br />It this score similar to a number of other action scores out there? - yes.  Is it a touch cliché a times? -maybe.  Is it a whole lot of fun? -Absolutely. This music captures so well the movie that it represents, but is a whole heck of a lot of fun as a standalone as well (I heard the score before seeing the movie).  <br />I suspect we'll be hearing parts of this score (especially tracks 2, 5, &amp; 15) used in upcoming movie trailers for some time to come. I would recommend this CD without reservation to anyone who has seen the movie and wants to relive some of the best moments without waiting for the DVD (or seeing it over and over at the theatre) or to anyone who enjoys fun, loud, energetic orchestral music (but I would highly recommend seing the movie as well one or two (or ten) times).
0790744759|5.0|This is probably my all time favorite movie and musical.  The entire cast is spectacular together.  This movie will bring out every emotion you can have, it will make you smile, laugh, and even cry.  It is about a family living in St. Louis, whose life is turned upside down by the idea of having to move to New York City.  It portrays each characters life, the diferences between them, and everything that they go through.  The musical numbers are encredible and very memerable!! They flow with the movie.  It does not seem as if they are just randomly put in to make the movie a musical.  Judy Garland's voice and dance numbers will give you chills, especially when she sings &quot;Have a Merry Little Christmas.&quot;  If you like musicals, I believe that you will truely Love this one. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B000024KBA|5.0|Well, I've been enjoying this album, along with the other two Syd Barrett albums for a few years now.   If you like one, you'll like them all.  Syd Barrett was NOT a genius, but a very talented songwriter who &quot;lost himself a bit&quot;, shall we say?   <br />I try to imagine walking into a pub late one night, and suddenly faced with this guy just playing his spacey music to a pair of drunks,  a few empty bottles and a bartender smoking a cigarette.   Pure magic.  The unique music from a guy who seems to have fallen down the rabbit hole and may still down there for all we know.  I remember hearing once he was alive and sort-of well, writing a history of art never meant for public consumption.  It would be a strange come-back for sure.  However, these albums somehow leave blanks for the listener's imagination to fill in. <br />I've heard REM do a cover of &quot;Dark Globe&quot; - and if nothing else, it amplifies the uniqueness of Syd Barrett.  It was less REM taking a song and making it their own, and more of REM trying to capture the mood of the source material by walking into Syd's territory.  I've heard Skip Spence's album OAR several times;  in comparison to MADCAP LAUGHS, it's musically richer and grounded in something closer to his peers.  But somehow Syd Barrett's music has a charm that the other loonies of rockdem lack:  It's kind of childish, it is kind of love-lorn, sort of romantic tipping back into the tragic.  The albums capture that delicate balance perfectly - amidst all the imperfection.<BR>  <BR>&quot;Dark Globe&quot; is the definitive Barrett composition - not necessarily the best.  If you need clarity and meaning in music, if you need demographic, if you need a genre and something that is identifiable as this or that - Syd is not for you.  This is one of those curious albums that you come across very rarely.  Like finding an old record in your grandmother's attic and listening to it constantly - a sonic snapshot of a few random moments that will never be again.
B00008LDPV|4.0|I'm not one of those who eat, sleep, and breathe the Matrix trilogy -- or animation in general, for that matter -- but I do enjoy non-Disney animated art and anime, and also graphic novels, with which this anthology of nine short films has a lot in common. Larry and Andy Lachowski, the creators of the Matrix universe, put this project together as a way of elucidating various unexplored aspects of their created world and providing some additional back-story, and they brought in some of the best contemporary animators to do it. Some of the nine follow the story faithfully, especially, &quot;Final Voyage of the Osiris&quot; and &quot;Program.&quot; Others are much more tangential, and I personally think those are the best: &quot;Kid's Story&quot; and &quot;A Detective Story,&quot; both by Shinjiro Watanabe, are excellent, yet different from each other. &quot;A Detective Story,&quot; especially, done in black, white, and intermediate gray shades, is very noir and reminiscent of Watanabe's &quot;Cowboy Bebop.&quot; &quot;Beyond,&quot; by Koji Morimoto, is a delightful piece about a girl looking for her wandering cat in a &quot;haunted house&quot; where physical laws are temporarily anomalous. The art itself is wonderful, very personal, not at all &quot;heroic&quot; (as in Yoshiaki Kawajiri's &quot;Program&quot;), with an incredible amount of background detail about a real neighborhood; you'll notice new things everytime you watch it. As for the rest, well, . . . &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; (in two parts) had some horrific images but it tried to cover too much territory too superficially; &quot;Matriculated&quot; was sort of interesting in its surreal, almost psychedelic colors, but it didn't actually have much to say; and &quot;World Record&quot; simply puzzled me. What *was* that about? All in all, a very interesting experiment. As others have commented, wouldn't it be great to have a collection like this to poke into the narrative nooks and crannies of the Star Wars universe?Wars universe?

B000002BQK|5.0|Listening to this album does no less than take one's breath away, for the sheer unbelivable musical brilliance of every track on Mariah Carey's BUTTERFLY is beyond words.  The sales of this album fail in comparison to Mariah's earlier works mainly because her fans became ignorant and decided to shut their minds to Mariah's endeavor into the world of R&amp;B.  Once given a chance, it is clear that this album will please even the most stubborn music anti-fan.  <BR>&quot;Honey&quot; is just so upbeat, funny, and lovable one can not help falling in love with it.  The song, and its promotional video, feature a much more sexy-playful side to Mariah that had not been seen in her earlier works.  &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;My All&quot;, and &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; are all ideal examples of newer versions of the typical tear-jerking type of ballads that Mariah is famous for, featuring beautiful yet depressing lyrics that tell of heartbreak and the struggle of the road to recovery.  In fact, many of the songs on this album have a far more solemn backbone than most of Mariah's previous releases, possibly due to this being the first album released after the end of her marriage.  In the end, BUTTERFLY has a message of triumph over tragedy that will remain in the heart of whoever agrees to give this album a chance for all time.
B00004YW6I|4.0|British-born PJ Harvey has made a name for herself as one of the most influential women in rock. Her persona has shifted from the feminist, bluesy punk-queen of the band PJ Harvey in DRY and RID OF ME, to the intense raw songstress of her solo debut in TO BRING YOU MY LOVE, to the depressed, cerebral chanteuse of IS THIS DESIRE? to finally, a more well-balanced, contented Polly Jean in STORIES FROM THE CITY, STORIES FROM THE SEA. This album is probably the one in which she strays the most from her punk roots, but remains anything but a sell-out.<br />1. BIG EXIT: Starts out with a twanging abrasive guitar and Polly Jean's wailing voice screaming amongst other things \\"Give me the gun.\\" It's hard to tell what this song is about with its chorus, and at first, I didn't like it, but it really grows on you if you listen enough, now it's one of my favorites.<br />2. GOOD FORTUNE: Polly Jean's happier persona surfaces with her reporting that she \\"threw her bad fortune off the top of a tall building\\" and \\"feels like a bird of paradise\\". Only PJ could sing a song about happiness which doesn't grate, preach, or sound horribly cheesy. One of my favorites.<br />3. A PLACE CALLED HOME: Polly Jean promises to find a place where she belongs. Very accessible and catchy. Anyone can relate to this one. Again, it's one of my favorites.<br />4. ONE LINE: This one is about keeping a relationship sanctified and protected from that which is unpure. Pretty good, somewhat intense in a mellow way if you can make sense of that. <br />5. A Beautiful Feeling: It is here that Radiohead's Thom Yorke is introduced onto the album. This is also the first slow song on the album. Not one of my favorites.<br />6. THE WHORE'S HUSTLE AND THE HUSTLER'S WHORE: My absolute favorite song on this album! Although the title may sound odd, this is an awesome song, it's filled with so much emotion, power, and PJ's husky, intense voice. Great lyrics too, \\"Speak to me of heroin and speed of universal laws, the whore's hustle and the hustler's whore, all around me, people bleed.\\" This one hit me right from the first listen.<br />7. THIS MESS WE'RE IN: Thom Yorke returns and another slow song entails. This one is somewhat better. Thom Yorke is so pained in his singing that he makes PJ's whispers sound stable. Not one of my favorites, but better.<br />8. YOU SAID SOMETHING: I seriously have no memory of this song, other than being almost positive that it is slow and that I don't remember being particularly fond of it. See what you think.<br />9. KAMIKAZE: At first, I didn't like this one, now though, in retrospect, it is kind of cool. The whole dramatic slamming verse with it's raw \\"Where the f*ck was I looking? When all his horses came in?\\" and then a tense drum beat leading into the falsetto chorus of \\"Kamikaze, \\"Kamikaze\\" shrieked by Polly Jean. It's short, so it works.<br />10. This Is Love: Again, at first, I didn't like this song. But there is something cathartic about it with its sturdy rock guitar and drumbeat with its lyrics, \\"I can't believe that life's so complex, when I just wanna sit here and watch you undress\\" shouted out. Turn this on when your significant other is in the room.<br />11. HORSES IN MY DREAMS: Another short one. I think I get this one confused with track #9. Very slow, not a favorite.<br />12. WE FLOAT: PJ's contented promise to \\"take life as it comes.\\" Another slow one, would be good only it is too long. The lyrics are what catch your attention: \\"...Before someone blows your g8ddamned brains out, You shoplifted as a child, I had a model's smile.\\" Good closing though.<br />For me, personally, this was my first experience with PJ Harvey, and it was quite a positive one. Interestingly enough, only half of the songs are ones that I really like, while none of them are bad, the rest are somewhat unmemorable, in my opinion. However the tracks I love: #1, #2, #3, #6, #9, #10, are so good that they make up for everything else. PJ Harvey is the perfect rock goddess: tough and punk, yet sometimes quiet and melodic, private, tragic, yet never giving up. She reminds me of a Fiona Apple, whose songs have much more pumch. She's also horribly underplayed and underrated. I'm so glad I was introduced to Polly Jean Harvey, because now, in checking out her other CD's, I am becoming quite a fan.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought Audioslave just for the fact that i loved Rage and Soundgarden, i had heard &quot;Cochise&quot; and was impressed but not overly impressed, and the single didnt inspire me to get the album.There wasent another album that i really cared for getting the day i picked up Audioslave and im glad, this in my opinion is one of the best albums since the dawn of this century. Chris Cornell is on his A game on this and Tom Morrello tears with his guitar effects and trippy solo's. All the songs with maybe an exception of 1 or 2 have single written all over it.<br />Cochise- Really kicks the album off with a lot of energy, hard hitting song really gets you hyped for the rest of the album. 4/5 stars<br />Show Me How To Live-good second song for the album, good old school Chris Cornell vocals, but the song is only good untill chris cornell starts singing with very little music in the background, those who heard the song know what im talking about, thats when the song gets awesome.4/5 stars<br />Gasoline-One of my favorites on the album, goes soft and hard, the verses are done great by Cornell, great melody. 5/5<br />What you are-catchy song, but can get old very fast. 3/5 stars<br />Like a stone-Im sure evryone has heard this one, great,with great melody and with a great solo by Morrello. 4/5 stars<br />Set It Off-another one of my personal favorites on the cd, the effects in the intro are amazing and Cornells high pitched scream that leads to the song getting hard is tops. 5/5 stars<br />Shadow On The Sun-Yet another one of my favorites. Complete song, with a short but amazingly sweet solo by Tom Morrello, and just great vocals and lyrics, very catchy song. 5/5<br />I Am The Highway-Great soft track, similar to Like A Stone only better singing by Cornell in this one, definetly chart topping quality.5/5<br />Exploder- a lot of energy and hard music, but sometimes i have trouble getting into it. 3 and half stars<br />Hypnotize-This is where i show Timmy C and Brad Wilk some love, but of course plenty of love goes out to Tom Morrello also, music is tops, and is great techno, gives a Prodigy meets Rage Against the machine feel. I think it would have been better without the vocals though, Cornell just doesent fit with the Techno style. 3/5<br />Bring Em Back Alive- This is without a doubt my favorite song on the album, has a great intro, great riffs, and a trippy solo by Morrello, and Cornell i think this is Cornells best work when he is yelling on this cd. Really could have opened the album with this song, i like it a lot better than Cochise, i really want to see them play this live, they didnt at Palooza. 5/5<br />Light My Way-Great verses done by CC, has some old school soundgarden vocal style to it. 4/5<br />Getaway Car-Very different from the other tracks on ths album, soft but very catchy. 4/5<br />The Last Remaining Light-Great Closer, nothing was done at its finest by the musicians but solid nontheless and finishes the Ausioslave expierience nicley. 4/5<br />Amazing Album, go pick it up
B00000253N|5.0|It is difficult now to explain how this album affected Dylan fans like myself in early 1975. Though still young, Dylan was regarded as a spent force. The trendiest British music magazine, NME, slammed the album on its release, only to publish an apology in the very next issue. This album was so obviously that good, that a magazine had to apologise for an opinion. Its greatness was a fact, no longer a matter of opinion.<br />Fans too young to remember Dylan's heyday, now had the thrill of a new Dylan classic with the promise of more to come. <BR>The songs rang true to those with little experience of love and loss of love. Nearly 30 years later they seem even more true. 'Simple twist of fate', 'If you see her say hello' and 'Big girl now', first caught the attention. Each express feelings of loss and the pain of jealousy like no preious rock or folk album.'Idiot Wind' seemed at first to be a pale rerun of 'Like a Rolling Stone', but turns out to be a more mature adult acceptance of the narrator's own faults.  <br />The under-produced apparent throwaways like 'Buckets of Rain' and 'You're going to make me lonesome' are actually classics in their own right. <br />Dylan once expressed surprise that anyone could 'enjoy' an album with so many sad songs. Perhaps the answer is that the pain is there  anyway. These songs simply celebrate the ability of the human spirit to confront and overcome it.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Definitely buy this soundtrack, but if you like the songs on it, go out and buy the albums those songs are from as well. The highlights are David Bowie, The Who, The Doors, Cream, Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, and The Ramones, so basically everything. I really hope this movie opens up new 'doors of perception' to some narrow-minded teenyboppers and their unlistenable pop stars. I'd love to hear some new bands that sound good.

B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age are the best band to come along in MANY years. End of story. <BR>In many ways they are like DEEP PURPLE (my all time favorite band) who continue to thrive outside of the good old U.S.A. Why? Because it's just about the music. <BR>There's no fashion statements, no trendy crap and no techno bull. Just good rockin'music! <BR>When I heard QOTSA live, I was blown away. They had that same essence which I've only seen in DP. Raw in your face, well played rock music. <BR>And then hearing them mention Deep Purple, well, I became an instant fan. <BR>Songs for the Deaf and Bananas (DP's latest) are my two favorite discs right now, with every song being good to excellent! Check out all the Amazon reviews for Bananas as well. Just when I was giving up on new music, both QOTSA and DP come through with great new discs. These albums get better with each listen. Celebrate! <br />4 1/2 stars: Songs for the Deaf <BR>5 stars: Bananas
0385504209|5.0|What really stands out about this book is how believable much of it can be. There's enough basis in fact to make me look up much of what is mentioned within its pages, and often leaving me pleasantly surprised as I search. An incredible twist ending brings the story full circle, and leaves me wanting more.<br />This is a book that everyone should have in their collection. Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;he never called again.&quot;
0451191153|5.0|In Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead, Rand paints a world with two extremes of human nature. On one side of the spectrum there is Peter Keating. Keating illustrates the second-hander, a chameleon, willing to adapt himself to his surroundings to appease others. Juxtaposed to the second-hander is Howard Roark. Never adulterating his own opinion, Roark remains an originator, a first-hander. Between these two extremes, lies a middle ground where people are a mixture of both. Gail Wynand, a newspaper magnate, believes he controls the public because of his power and wealth. But in the end, he realizes that it is they that control him. A man who controls others through the acquisition of souls, Ellsworth Toohey is a first-hander who promotes second-handedness. Through these characters, the novel is an allegory of real-world people. There are selfish individualists and then there are devout followers of altruism. Whatever it may be, all people exist on a continuum between Roark and Keating. <br />Peter Keating lives his life through others. When Keating is first introduced, he is valedictorian at his graduation looking for a former competitor to reaffirm his triumph over a rival. Keating cares only for defeating someone else. He does not care for himself. Keating has no passion, no driving force to make decisions for himself. His mother decides he will accept the offer from the Francon firm. The lack of an individual self manifests itself also in his pliable code of ethics. On the job, Keating repeatedly uses sycophancy and other such ruses to woo Francon and to propel himself to a higher position within the firm. He caters to their vices and lets their tastes dictate his life. Keating's pretentiousness cannot hide his incompetence in designing buildings. Second-handers need the help of others to achieve success. Peter Keating needs Howard Roark do his drawings for buildings through his career. Keating needs journalists like Dominique Francon and Ellsworth Toohey to give him a good name. Peter needs his fellow men for their respect and competency. By the end of the novel, Peter Keating realizes that he has tried to live his life through others. But it is too late; Peter has already compromised his life so that it is more acceptable to the general public.<BR>The second-hander represents the foil to the individualist. The individualist relies on no one. Howard Roark embodies the soul of the individualist or first hander. Growing up, Roark had no family and thus worked on building projects to support himself through school. After being expelled from the Stanton Institute of Technology for designing free-thinking houses, Roark is called into the Dean's office. The Dean offers him a second chance to return to the school and begin anew. Roark refuses; he asserts that he has learned all that he has needed from the school. With this tone set, Roark's resolve will be tested. When asked by his mentor, Henry Cameron, to develop projects more suitable to popular tastes, Roark responds with a decisive answer that he would rather starve. His uncompromising attitude toward catering to tastes prevents him from attaining numerous commissions. But the few that Roark does receive are from individual men who admire his audacity. Throughout the novel, Roark is static, never compromising his morals. <BR>While Keating is naïve and easy to manipulate and Roark is obstinate and maverick, there is a middle ground. The self made man, the American businessman, closely resembles Gail Wynand. As a youngster, he was always told by superiors, \\"You don't run things around here.\\" He rises to this challenge and through individual effort; Wynand builds a vast newspaper chain that sways popular opinion. However, Wynand rarely agrees or qualifies the opinions presented in his paper. In fact, he privately despises them. He compromises his beliefs in order to attain greatness. When Wynand marries Dominique, he adamantly pursues a hard policy of banning his wife from beingmentioned in the papers. He creates a barrier separating his personal life from his public life. His love for his work is tested morally when Roark is put on trial for dynamiting Cortlandt. On one hand, he can give up his newspaper and power in order to try and sway public opinion for Roark. The alternative is to let his passion sit idle while he sees his paper denouncing his friend. He fails to realize it is the people whom he holds power over that ultimately control him. When he finally does understand his mistake, he decides to compromise his morals to maintain his newspaper and reputation. Wynand is a creative man capable of capturing the unattainable, but in the process he sacrifices his morals to reach his goals.  In that sense, they have lost their place among the respected in society. Wynand is not a true uncompromising first-hander, yet he is not a leeching second-hander. These people may attain greatness but at a hefty price.<BR>  The Fountainhead illustrates an allegory of characters that symbolize types of men. In the novel, there are true first-handers and second-handers. The few extremists like Keating and Roark represent only a minority of men. Wynands meet a tragic end And it is the Keatings that feed off Roarks to prevail. It is ultimately the individualistic spirit of Howard Roark that will rise above it all.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is one of the Beatles' crowning achievements. The three best songs on this album are: A Day in the Life, Within You Without You, and She's Leaving Home. Interesting how one song is a Lennon tune, one song is a Harrison tune, and one song is a McCartney tune. The talent is spread out on this one. Also I would like to add that anybody who thinks Within You Without You is not an incredible piece of music is an idiot.
B00004XMV6|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. Kim Basinger is poignant and astounding. Her wounded eyes that belie the sexual obsession is such an affective contrast.Her performance is impeccable.<br />The plot is disturbing and yet common. I was turned on, infuriated, and -worst of all- familiar with the subject matter. Notice the subtle things that change as Elizabeth falls deeper into this sadistic union. (the darkening clothing and make-up for instance)<br />This nothing short of an American classic and one of the only films I want to own.<br />I also recommend the novel of the same name!!!!
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a surprisingly strong and mature album from - of all people - Christina Aguilera. I guess I'm not in the typical audience of Aguilera fans (my CD collection is a lot of The Clash, The Cure and Belle &amp; Sebastian - the usual indie faves) but I'm very impressed by Stripped. Unlike Britney Spears, Aguilera has vocal talent and she showcases it on this album without the unneccessary bells &amp; whistles. The songwriting is impressive for a mainstream pop artist. The album is cohesive yet diverse - balls-out rock like Fighter and club-friendly grooves like Dirrty sit together. Soar, Get Mine Get Yours and Keep On Singin' My Song are some of the more impressive, lesser known tracks. Even the overplayed Beautiful has grown on me. I'm certainly not averse to mainstream pop but it's usually only one single that I like for awhile until it gets overplayed. For the first time in a long time, here's a sophisticated pop album that I enjoyed from start to dramatic finish.<br />Heh, I actually wish I'd gotten to see the Justified/Stripped tour. Yeah, you heard right... I'm also diggin' on the Timberlake. I guess I have to turn in my indie cred card now.
B00009ATIX|2.0|Reasons I didn't like this movie:<br />1. It contained about ten thousand confusing dream/memory/reality sequences. It seemed to me that the director made the film and was watching it and decided it was boring, so he put in a whole lot of short face shots to make it boring and confusing (which of course is a whole lot better than just boring). Anyway, it was nearly impossible to tell what was real and what was not, and instead of providing the viewer with a thoughtful sense of surreality, depth, isolation, and insight, it simply left the viewer dazed and confused.<br />2. There was far too little dialogue, and far too much whirring, crackling, disjointed music, and that sound that comes with being pulled into the gravity field of a planet. This of course was combined with the confusing visuals.<br />3. The acting--what little acting there was; George Clooney was the main character, but mostly we saw unmoving and asleep or a shot of the back of his head. (Anyway the whole movie was too dark to see him anyway but I'll get to that later.)The little dialogue he had was adequately given but did not make up for anything. The supporting characters were mediocre EXCEPT for one guy whose name I couldn't catch, due to the inarticulate speech of his fellow characters. He played his part exceptionally, keeping to character and using incredibly expressive gestures.<br />4. The movie was dark--it was hard to see faces and expressions, which is what the entire movie was comprised of.<br />5. Solaris. They kept showing it, with its little electric currents, and at one point an unnamed man said it seemed to be responding to their observations--only unfortunately, no pattern could be detected in the movements of the pink and purple gases. Sorry-I missed something here? And at then end, it kept getting smaller, until it sort of looked like a doorknob, I guess, which was sort of significant, but there was no connection-there was the blue wire and the red wire, and they were telling us as the viewer to put them together.<br />7. It was hard to detect any sort of plot, theme, meaning, or point in this movie. I know many people would argue otherwise and some would say I'm just too stupid and shallow to see it, but while I admit that I may not be the deepest thinker, I really did try to find a meaning and couldn't. I think it may have been because of all the defects above befuddled whatever point it may have originally had. Or maybe it never had one in the first place. Its based on a book--maybe it was one of those books where the author had an inkling of higher thinking, of deeper thoughts, but couldn't quite grasp the concepts and so retreated into vagueness.<br />That's it--those are the reasons I didn't like Solaris. If you bothered to read the whole thing, I hope you understand my point of view. (If of course you simply read the first line and then scrolled down to say that my review wasn't helpful, well, I hope that you feel tremendous shame.) If I can get one person to save their money--and hopefully end up donating it to charity--by not buying Solaris, my job is done. Thanks for reading.ewer to put them together.<BR>7.

B000002KIE|5.0|it is by far the best punk cd of all time !!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I hear complaints about the Neo and Trinity sex scene, and I agree that it was awful, but from the viewpoint of the filmmakers, it was necessary.  Think about it.  Without that scene, the movie would have only gotten a PG-13 rating.  The first movie had lots of gun violence, which automatically requires an R rating.  The lobby scene featured tons of police officers and such getting totally blown away.  It was worthy of the R rating it got.  This was not so with Reloaded.  The majority of the violence was of the martial arts variety, which is not enough by itself for an R rating.  For anybody who has seen Daredevil, it is far more bloody and violent than Reloaded, yet it only got PG-13.  Why?  Because there was no gun violence.  Even though there are scenes where you see a character with three pencils stuck halfway in his throat, it's still not the R worthy gun violence that the ratings association is so strict with.  The sex scene in Reloaded was a necessary element to assure the R rating, which was required of the movie.  You are probably wondering why it's necessary.  Well just ask yourself, what would you have thought if you saw that Reloaded was only PG-13?  I know I would have thought that it was crappy, and couldn't possibly have any good action scenes.  Quite simply, The Matrix couldn't be The Matrix without an R rating.  This may be a silly sounding reason, but it is only logical reason why the Wachowskis would include such a horribly out of place and stuffy sex and rave club scene.
0060934719|1.0|&quot;Stardust&quot; was just about the worst book i have ever read.<br />It's extremely boring, and some parts are very inappropriate for little kids.The first chapter was pointless and too long (30-something pages) and had bits of fluff that were not important.  Every chapter is 20 pages or more. I stopped reading it by chapter 4.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill's solo debut is arguably one of the greatest R&amp;B albums in history,talking about all subjects of life,also deservingly winning 5 Grammies.From social issues(&quot;Everything IS Everything&quot;),to not loving a man anymore(&quot;I Used To Love Him(featuring Queen Of Hip Hop/Soul Mary J.Blige)&quot;),and also NOT being able to leave a relationship(&quot;Ex-Factor&quot;).All 3 subjects are sung with perfection,and so is every other song on this gold mine of an album,the true highlights being &quot;Doo Wop(That Thing)&quot;,the remake of &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You&quot;,and &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;.This album also gave us real music lovers relief that the genre we all love/hate called hip-hop still actually had organic talent out there.There are no obvious flaws showing here,except for the almost pointless clas interludes about love,but that small flaw is overshadowed by the remarkable songs.Ms.Hill put an amazing effort on this album,and it will be remembered by music lovers 10 years from now.
B00002E224|5.0|I'd give it 4.5 stars-- but that's not an option.  I think this is a great film.  I'm biased because of my many European train trips and because I think French girls are intriguing and I'm still kinda hoping &quot;it&quot; might happen to me.  It seems a sequel could only ruin the beauty of the first film's indefinite ending-- but I definitely want to check it out.
B000099T2L|4.0|I can remember it like yeaterday...Beyonce singing those 13-year-old ghetto girl anthems with her fellow members(or back-up singers)of Destiny's Child...Well,its 2003 now and,and Beyonce's done some growing up,and its obvious on her solo debut,&quot;Dangerously In Love&quot;.She's grown lyrically and musically,not just singing about leavin' yo man and bein' a strong,black woman anymore.But,don't think she's weak now,she's still singing those &quot;you betta get out of muh face!&quot; songs(the empowering &quot;Me,Myself,And I&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;),except she's made them more sophisticated,actually giving a good reason for leaving the man.There are a handful of highlights here,from the sexy &quot;Speechless&quot; to the Ella Fitzgerald-ish &quot;Gift From Virgo.She keeps the album upbeat,too,examples being the two deservingly #1 hits &quot;Baby Boy(featuring reggae star Sean Paul)&quot;,and &quot;Crazy In Love(featuring her &quot;man&quot; Jay-Z).There are some sightful flaws,like the fact that all the song are about nothing but love&amp;relationships.And,the way the real highlights are pushed to the end of the album.Instead of those flaws and a few other minor setbacks,we can expect nothing but greatness from Ms.Knowles in the future.
B000005S0I|5.0|This is the record that sounds odd when the rest of their discography is taken into consideration. But at the same time, it makes perfect sense that they made an album that sounded like this. It's very representative of its time period, but at the same time, it doesn't sound dated. On the contrary. I like this record so much more than when I first heard it. It's a very subtle album, but in the subtleties is where its charm lies. The songs are some of Mr. Smith's most enduring and catchy. No less than three post punk classics are included in the form of &quot;Subway Song,&quot; &quot;Fire In Cairo,&quot; and the undeniably great &quot;10.15 Saturday Night.&quot; All Cure fans should hear this album at least once to hear one of the band's finest albums, and one of the finest albums of the initial post-punk/new wave movement.
B00000K19E|5.0|When I first saw the Matrix in the theatres I was immediately taken with the central proposition which looked oddly like one of the options in Descartes' Discourse on Method.  What if, and how would we know, we are indeed in a sleep/dream world, manipulated by an external controlling force?  How would we know if we were awake or still asleep?  Neo sleeps and his brain hints at this possibility.  Slowly he is tracked by those from the true world, while agents of the external controlling force also monitor him in an effort to capture the others.  Neo is eventually awakened into the `real world' and the Matrix takes off on it's epic ride of slow motion Kung Fu mayhem and beautifully choreographed gunfights.  This combination of cerebral back story and excessive destruction made this movie a hit across all strata of viewing demographics.  Everytime I watch it now on DVD there is some new bit to marvel at, either in subtle movements of foreshadowing, the amazing fight scenes, or even the pace and placement of music.  I enjoyed it then, and now, it's highly recommended.  I also enjoyed the sequel but will get to that when it's released on DVD in a few weeks, and like many others I look forward to the completion of the trilogy in a month.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Man! this cd is amazing. i used to only listen 2 strictly rap. i couldnt stand any other music. my friend bought this cd and it was all he listend 2. i hated it at first but when i started listenin 2 it i could relate 2 the lyrics. when i was goinh thru hard times i used 2 always listen 2 rap and i thought rap was all i could relate 2. it turns out that i cant relate to any other group more than LP. their the only group that i can relate 2 every single song. my friend let me borrow the cd and it blew my mind. during bad times sometimes i wont know exactly how 2 explain how i feel and i heard LP and they said exactly how i feel and i was shocked. people talk about how LP is getting old and unoriginal and they jus talk about the same thing. when you can relate 2 what theyre saying the songs never get old. the song i like the most is \\"Easier 2 Run\\". its so tru and so real and i couldnt relate 2 any thing more than mikes part. i also love \\"Breaking the Habit\\" cuz its something that i need 2 do. another great sond is \\"Lying From You\\". the intro is so hot and mikes verses are so real. it feels so good 2 know that theres other people in this world that go thru the same things that i go thru. this cd is great. 4 anyone that hasnt found themselves yet or go thru alotta s*** or feel that theyre an outkast in this world should try listening 2 linkin park. i thank god my friend got me into them.
B000002GQG|5.0|This album is another masterwork from the Moodies. Although it occupies third place in my private rank (behind To Our Children's Children Children and Days Of Future Passed ), it is also the very special and different one. Recorded in 1968, just in the middle of the hippie era, it was one of its important exponents, as well musically as lyrically. MB practically left this kind of hippie psychedelia on their next album (On The Threshold Of A Dream); they never tried it again. So, it is interesting as \\"one and the only\\" hippy Moody Blues. Also, they tried, even they HAD to make it great after their grandiose success with \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" where they perfectly blended rock with the symphony orchestra. Although they did not incorporate a symphony orchestra this time, they strove to emulate it themselves. The results are maybe not as stunning as on Days, but chapeau bas for rich arrangements, fine melodies, for all the grandeur. They used 24 instruments here, and all that worked perfectly! On the other hand, this is the first MB album I review here that contains some  songs I just do not care so much for; nevertheless it still deserves five stars (I'd say 4.75). OK., now the songs:<br />Departure - a small portion of Graeme's poetry, a real departure to the trip outside and within that follows... 7/10<br />Ride My See-Saw - perfect song. Harder rocking than others, with hypnotising, driving rhythm section, fine guitar work (the short solo is a typical sparse, but delightfully melodic moody gem), great voices.  Maybe it's this album's main manifesto: run away from everyday's slavery, ride with us and be free... but unlike many other songs of 68, not so literal - I can only guess what this ride would be... 10/10<br />Dr Livingstone I Presume - very 60's sounding midtempo song. Also very melodic but a bit lightweight here; pleasant but not great. Beatles fans should be pleased, but I rather appreciate that in MB what is different from Beatles, not what is similar. Still good 7/10<br />House Of Four Doors - I just don't get this song. I admit, it's very mystical, but I do not fully understand this mystic. If I tried an explanation, the doors symbolise different forms of human activity: visual arts, music, science... Finally, the last door is to travel within, which is the most difficult but brings a chance to find the truth. But probably there can be many explanations - just try for yourself.... The main melody is beautiful, no question, but the chorus and strange sounds here and there make me feel a bit uneasy. So, not a favorite, but for sheer artistic ambition and some (probably) profound metaphors deserves 6/10<br />Legend Of A Mind - killer song of Ray Thomas. \\"Timothy Leary's dead... No, No, No, No, he's outside, looking in...\\" So it starts. The longest and the most psychedelic here with its almost 7 minutes of superb performance, complex, changing melodies and rhythm patterns and interesting, although I guess not quite serious text. As far as I know, Ray was not at all so much into \\"opening the doors of perception\\" with the stuff Timothy Leary proposed...So, was it a praise or rather gentle joke? Who knows, Ray's lyrics are often strange and intelligent (check out \\"Lazy Day\\" from the next album). But the song was taken seriously and soon became one of the hymns of this era - funny thing because MB were into the flower power movement just for this one album, with some distance; very English way. Musically this song is maybe the best psychedelia in existence, beating everything from early Pink Floyd to Jefferson Airplane. Unbelievably great 10/10<br />House Of Four Doors part 2 - see part one 6/10<br />Voices In The Sky - this song started side 2 of the original vinyl album. It's offers the most ethereal and beautiful rock music ever created , bringing the minstrels of old ages to mind...Fine acoustic guitars, tablas, sitars, woodwinds, eastern and medieval flavours, beautiful soft voices and trademark mellotron create the unique, dreamy atmosphere. This song is also dreamy, also good, but maybe too pastoral and soft, on the verge of being dull. But pastoral scenes described pleasantly recall feelings we could experience lying on a green meadow on a sunny summer day...8/10<br />The Best Way To Travel - the killer song of Pinder. I love everything here: the praise of imagination and will as a driving force that allows us do and know virtually everything we need, to travel through endless space outside and within. Uptempo rhythm and the melody full of dignity but also very uplifting... The song that may bring the power and faith to depressed and weak, change their lives for better... 10/10<br />Visions Of Paradise - this song starts the most ethereal, mystical and profound part of the album. Also very psychedelic with its intriguing and varied instrumental backgrounds of acoustic guitars, flutes, woodwind instruments and eastern flavours. The dreamy atmosphere is emphasised  by it's lyrics; it's a mystical love song...10/10<br />The Actor - again, the beautiful dreamy song. Pure escapism - dreaming, daydreaming, feelings of love...The stream of consciousness, loose pictures in a relaxing mode, so is the music. Evokes the feel of the music of old...the minstrels  10/10<br />The Word/OM<BR>\\"Two notes of the chord, that's our poor scope, and to reach the chord is our life's hope. And to name the chord is important to some, so they give it a word, and the word is OM\\" so ends the fine mystical introduction of Graeme Edge (as always, a piece of fine poetry). And so starts Mike Pinder's song that may help us find the lost chord.<BR>The answer might be eastern philosophy that sees the unity of all things... I don't know, but I love this song, its eastern flavour, sitar improvisations, its slow pace. It really may help you find this lost chord if you try at least a little bit... 10/10
B00008XEOI|5.0|I have never ever bought a dvd in my life. I usually rent them, however, this is the ONE DVD that I decided to buy. I bought the Collectors Gift Set and i could not even open it because it just looked so damn good wrapped. However, my curiosity of the set got to me and I decided to open it up and, boy am i so damn happy that i bought this. The extras are amazing. A WHOLE CD full of extras that you actually want to watch. Enough has been said about this movie, it is without a shadow of a doubt the epitome of what animated or any kind of movie should be. I highly recommend it. If you buy only one dvd in your life, this should be it. Hakunama Tata
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This has to be one of the best, if not THE best Iron Maiden Album there is. Yeah, the production quality isn't nearly as good as the other albums, but I don't really care. The lyrics, the original sound, and...well everything about it totally overwhelms the production quality. This one is right up there with Piece of Mind, Number of the Beast, and 7th Son. The music is hard and heavy, and the lyrics powerful and thought provoking, probably even moreso than any other album they've done. This is a MUST have album!
0385504209|1.0|The real DaVinci is nothing compared to Dan Brown and his masterpiece! All I can say is read it now!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album just shows that Linkin Park is simply getting better with every new album they release.  Their music is 100% clean with no cuss words, sexual innuendo, violence, or talking about drug use in their lyrics.  What more could you ask for?  Good clean music that you can truly sympathize with.  That's one of the marks of a truly talented band.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I love this album, this is one of the first metal albums i ever owned and really brought me into the underground scene i now listen to.  Every thing on this album is wonderful, from the abstract guitar solos to the grumbling vocals of Dave Mustaine.  A thrash classic \m/

B00005B36H|4.0|This is one of those bands that has a HUGE following, so i couldnt ignore the hype.  This is a very interesting  and fresh style of music that is all there own.  I really caught on to this album.  They seem like very talented musicians compaired to the avg. mainstream rock group, definetly worth a listen.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this CD is great, but it's not as good as their previous recording &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;. Some songs are ok, others are not as good, but I didn't really find any REALLY REALLY GOOD songs on here like the CD before this. I hope that in the future, Nickelback will release an album that is heavier, more technical, and has more guitar solos then the others and pisses all over SILVER SIDE UP. ROCK ON!!!!!!
B000063DI9|5.0|Although every Iron Maiden album is awesome, this album has something so cool that makes it the best.
B00006CXXU|5.0|this cd is sooooooooo good all the songs she wrote in i could feel each song this cd if u dont have it u suck cuz this cd has-rock/pop/latin/rap/rnb/hip-pop/a bit of everything so go out nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww in buy this cd
0393039765|1.0|This is one of the few books I've read where I think the movie was actually better than the book.  Even then, I don't think it's so much that the movie was BETTER, but the book just works better as a movie.  It plays out nicer.  The book stayed right on par with the movie and only a few tiny events were changed.<br />If you don't know the premise, fight club is about a guy who shall forever remain nameless.  He can't sleep at night, so he goes to support groups for diseases and problems he doesn't have.  He meets a woman named Marla Singer and they form a hate-hate relationship.  Then the guy meets a man named Tyler and his entire life changes.  He goes from a condo filled with IKEA furniture to a crack-house reject of a house.  <br />He forms a club called Fight Club with Tyler.  Men beat each other up and feel great about it afterwards.  Woo.<br />It was a quick read and a poor book.  I'd absolutely recommend renting the movie over wasting your time reading the book.
B0000D14JV|5.0|This movie is such a good one!! The acting was great!! The effects, plot, Just a delight!! <BR>  This movie shows how some types of teenagers don't respect or listen to thier parents, and need interfearing from the out side. Young and old people can lean as one from this well-done movie.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There are quite a lot of great bands who lose their style within making an album in the 21st century. Well-known examples: Red Hot Chili Peppers (changed their totally weird characteristic funk music into commercial pop-rock), Bon Jovi (their great 80's Rock changed into slow love-rock) and many, many more! But what about Radiohead?? Well, how could a band change their style when they've never had any?? Radiohead do not try to let their listeners put their music into any category, the most important thing for Radiohead is, I think, doing philosophy and put this into well describing words! It's not easy to understand Radiohead by listening to a few songs... You have to know every line by heart and you have to interprete it your own way! It's philosophy for YOU, not for Radiohead! (At least I think so ;) Ok, back to this album: There ain't many words to say about it but: This is also a great example for what I've written in the last few lines...-like every other album of Green Plastic Radiohead
B0000A1RJI|5.0|When I went to see this movie, the first thing that popped out at me, even in the first five minutes of it, was the music. Even in the theatres I was tapping my foot to the theme! I can hear it in my head right now! Though this may sound crazy, I don't know one person who has heard this soundtrack who doesn't think that it is pure genius. I can't wait for the sheet music to come out so I can convince my orchestra director to let us play it. Pirates of the Caribbean is, by far, one of the best soundtracks!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|It is amazing how Iron Maiden gets better and better with the passing of the years. Unlike many other bands that dissapear after they have a hit or two, Maiden comes up with something so sublime and original every time they release an album, that this originallity make them the best, and this album demonstrates this.
B000084T18|1.0|ok i like every kind of music but come on 50 cent cd is only worth 50 cent may i say anymore will not cuz this cd really sucks its so stupid theres only 1 good song in that song ''in da club '' sucks big time plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz dont buy this cd ant worth the money
B00005MP58|5.0|The acting, casting, directing, set, etc. of this production are fabulous, and eminently watchable and rewatchable. Unfortunately, the DVD is a bit of a disappointment. The color transfer is a washout -- all you have to do is watch the version that appears on broadcast and this DVD. It's sad, frankly. The DVD should look better than broadcast, and while sharp, the color problems are evident. <br />You get used to it, at any rate, and can still enjoy the miniseries. But this production deserved far better treatment, alas.
B00004T9UF|5.0|High sarcasm. Eminem is a work in progress and this album is mandatory to chart his future.  He had better record all his tracks now because it will probably be a tragic one (as with many other Rap artists of late).<BR>He tells it the way he sees it whether you like it or not.<BR>He will always have to prove himself to his peers even if he is accepted into the community. It makes for a quality work.<BR>The album is very good. Lots of great tracks.<BR>If you have NOT been shocked elsewhere already you might be here. <BR>A musical snapshot of urban and sub-suburbian American.
B000089RV6|3.0|I loved this album when I was a freshman in High School, but can't hardly listen to it now. The songs are just silly. Bon's clever sneer is gone and Brian Johnson sounds like Rod Stewart with a hernia. Compared to Powerage (their best album)it hardly bears a second listen.<br />Get the early stuff
B000067FP8|5.0|This film is fantastic. Out of 100 I would give it 10000 and the zeros go on. If you haven't seen the first one I suggest you do as it helps you understand the concept of the storyline. The gremlins getting loose in the lab is a fantastic part, and the end scene where the talking gremlin sings 'new-york new-york' is hilarious. A definate must see!
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD. And as everybody else knows, I love Avril Lavigne! I think she's awesome. All this saying she's punk stuff, she really didn't say she's punk. And she said herself that she's NOT punk, she just likes to &quot;rock out&quot;. She's an individual, and she really says whats on her mind. She's NOT trying to pose as a punk or anything. She even admitted that she's starting to like &quot;girly&quot; clothes. So come on people! You all are just plain RUDE.<br />Besides, if you DONT like Avril Lavigne, why dont you just leave her alone? It would do all the fans and people who like her much good. <br />Okay. Avril really doesn't play the guitar that much. But she said that in a magazine too. She said she just strums some chords and stuff like that. And she didn't sing too well live at first, but she's getting a LOT better. And in studios and stuff, she sings pretty well. She used to sing a lot in church. You all just don't know enough about her to judge her! And if she WERE a poser, how come she's so famous and so successful? How come so many people buy her records? People have different opinions of people. And you should respect that.<br />Anyway, I thought this album rocked. So there!<BR>I loved every song on here, only I got sick of Tomorrow pretty quickly :)
B000089RVX|2.0|First of all, please let me refute the Linkin Park/nu metal comparisons. If you are familiar with the rest of my reviews you should know how much I despise this so called &quot;genre&quot; &amp; how I will never touch any nu metal CD with a half metre stick, like I think most sane people should act, but that's another issue. Anyway, Evanescence are NOT, IN ANY WAY, nu metal, &amp; I don't think any band with a singer reminiscent of Amy Lee could be called nu metal. The white rap part in &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is a mere unsuccessful experiment, albeit reasonably tolerable. Evanescence are no Christian rock either: Only &quot;Tourniquet&quot; features religious lyrics, &amp; even they are on the more personal side, as opposed to preaching. After I read the smashing customers reviews on this page &amp; had a fairly good idea about the band's sound, I was very excited about buying this album. I really wanted to like it, but alas... For the sake of decency, I'll first mention the positive things I have to say about it; mainly the frequently mentioned powerful vocals of Amy Lee, the attempt to write deep lyrics, &amp; the fact that the band has its own unique sound (I was agonised by the unfair Linkin Park/nu metal influence throughout the album. If someone heard this without reading those comparisons they wouldn't make them, I'm sure). The problem is this unique sound wears extremely thin once you get the idea: The same chorus passage using the same unimaginative fragmented guitar chord, the melodies which sound pretty much the same... Don't get me wrong, it's OK when most songs on an album have the same sound, it makes the album sound cohesive. Not here though. To be more blunt, once you've heard &quot;Going Under&quot; you've pretty much heard the majority of the album. What makes the experience disappointing instead of bad, though, is that the band obviously has a discernable amount of talent. Amy surely has, &amp; the moments where the band tampers with the loud/soft dynamic in a more innovative way, or when the piano &amp; strings come in, show a huge potential. Whenever they get out of their self patented formula, on ballads such as &quot;My Immortal&quot; &amp; &quot;Hello&quot;, as well as the eerie chorus outro of &quot;Whisper&quot;, they manage to sound inviting &amp; intriguing; Unfortunately, that doesn't happen much. Great graphic lyrics like the ones featured on &quot;Imaginary&quot; deserve a better backdrop, a better melody, a better usage of sound effects &amp; unexpected twists, &amp; above all a far better understanding of the band's possibility of artistic achievement. I am not going to buy their next album unless I see them live up to what they're meant to be &amp; earned them my two &amp; a half stars, &amp; if they're going to continue repeating themselves the way they do on Fallen it's just not going to happen.
B00006690G|5.0|I am working my way backwards through Eminems releases.  <BR>Maybe some might find this over produced compared to his earlier works and his style more refined.<BR>It is perfect for wide commercial release and the stories told in the songs reflect the times. The majority can idenity with what he is saying and what does that say?<BR>I don't know who could find this album threatening or shocking in the Post 9-11 World.<BR>Comical and sad; facinating. High sarcasm! All of Eminem's Albums will hold your attention.<BR>Great lyrics and stories.  Great music.  <BR>You can hate the person that sang the song but the music is very catchy.
B000024QML|5.0|This album, Very and its much more rare companion, Very Relentless, can be summed up in the Pet Shop Boys' own words (one of the lyrics taken from the song Yesterday When I was Mad) -- they've 'both made such a little go a very long way'. A very long way, indeed.<br />All of the songs on this album have the same feel -- the same texture, the same lyrical quality, the same 'groove' if you will -- which is remarkable for a collection of different songs, from ballads to a roaring remake of the Village People's Go West (a song Toyota still uses occasionally in advertising -- listen for the backing music). One would almost swear that the actual Village People are making up the chorus as Neil Tennant's high-pitched, flat voice calls out 'Life is peaceful there' as the gruff, deep voices growl, GO WEST!<br />All the songs are dancable (not true of all the songs on all the albums) -- the videos which accompany this album all have the same computer-generated motion and costume and background (someone in the Pet Shop Boys camp obviously had recently discovered computer-generated graphics and animation and decided to have some fun!). I was frankly a bit disappointed with the videos, because the idea was original, but it was the same idea for each video (and we fans are used to stylish, original videos for each song).<br />This album will please Pet Shop Boys fans; it may find a good home with electronic/disco music fans. As with all Pet Shop Boys songs, listen to the lyrics -- they are witty and thoughtful -- the song Dreaming of the Queen actually plays on a recurrent nightmare/stress dream that the average Brit would have but Americans don't -- the stress that the Queen drops by for a visit when you're not ready (either undressed, or dirty house, &c.) -- probably the closest equivalent stress dream in American terms would be the test-anxiety pop-quiz-you-haven't-studied-for dream.<br />Other songs include the poignant The Theatre, in which one can sense the frustration of struggling artists as they watch their more successful compatriots pass by; To speak is a sin, recapturing a word from a previous hit, It's a sin, something the no-longer Roman Catholic Tennant likes to muse over now and again; the first semi-hit Can you forgive her, a crashing, triumphant, psychological song that reinforces the ambiguous sexuality of this duo (later to be made less so).<br />So, pay attention to the lyrics, and have a Very Very good listen.ruggling artists as they watch their more successful compatriots pass by; To speak is a sin, recapturing a word from a previous hit, It's a sin, something the no-longer Roman Catholic Tennant likes to muse over now and again; the first semi-hit Can you forgive her, a crashing, triumphant, psychological song that reinforces the ambiguous sexuality of this duo (later to be made less so).<br />So, pay attention to the lyrics, and have a Very Very good listen.
B00005AXEL|5.0|After a stunning career with Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s, Stevie Nicks emerged as one of the hottest solo acts of the music industry in the 1980s with BELLA DONNA and THE WILD HEART.  But although she scored a memorable success with Fleetwood Mac on 1987's TANGO IN THE NIGHT, after 1985 the quality of her solo work began to decline.  1989's THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR offered the memorable &quot;Rooms on Fire&quot; but was disappointing as a whole, and of 1994's STREET ANGEL the less said the better.  Her occasional performances with Fleetwood Mac aside, it seemed that her glory days as a solo act were far behind.<br />Then in 2001 Nicks quietly released TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA.  Working with what seemed a different producer on almost every cut and drawing in supporting talent from the likes of Cheryl Crowe, Nicks stripped herself of her past personas.  Gone was Rhiannon, gone was the Welsh Witch, the Gypsy.  Gone were the third person lyrics, the ethereal notes, the hard rock flourishes.  TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA was Stevie Nicks, pure and simple and unadorned.  Quite a lot of her long-time fans, who would have preferred Nicks to remain in her Bella Donna persona forever, balked.  But quite a few people who had never been fans suddenly reappraised her.  And when all was said and done, Nicks garnered some of the finest critical praise of her long career and picked up a Grammy nomination in the process.<br />Opening with a solid rocker on the title cut, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA finds Nicks remarkably unpretentious and completely devoid of the self-indulgence that made THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR such a disappointment and STREET ANGEL such a disaster.  Her voice, always a delicate instrument, has changed, and the high notes are gone and the lower notes have become deeper still--but at both extremes it now possesses an unexpectedly dark richness of tone.  Both it, and the emotional tones of her performance, are those of a mature woman in full command of her talents.<br />Some have complained that there is not really a &quot;hit single&quot; track on this album, and in a sense that is true--nothing here jumps ahead of the pack.  But that is not because the music is weak; rather, it is because it is all so consistently good.  And throughout the entire collection the overall sound creates a somewhat hypnotic quality that gradually draws you deeper and deeper into the artist's skills.  Because of this, it would be extremely difficult to pinpoint any one single selection for singular praise; I will say, however, that I find &quot;It's Only Love&quot; particularly fine.<br />When I first sat down to listen to this recording I found myself completely surprised by Nicks' overall approach, which is considerably more disciplined than anything she has previously offered.  I was not immediately enthusiastic and I set the recording aside--only to find myself drawn to it again and again, and with each listening discovering more and more in it.  And I now think of this as quite possibly Stevie Nicks best overall solo release.  Whatever the case, it is certainly her most subtle and most complex effort to date.<br />I had the pleasure of seeing Fleetwood Mac on the SAY YOU WILL tour, and while Nicks did not perform any of the selections from this album (the only selection of her solo work she offered was a knock-out &quot;Stand Back&quot;), I found her live performance with the band very similar in tone to TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA: completely unaffected with the focus on the music itself.  After some three decades of stardom and one of the most jolting personal roads imaginable, at the end of the day Stevie Nicks has become a musician in her own right.  And in an industry that spawns so few of them, that is the highest compliment any one can offer a rock star.  The bell has a deeper tone, and it tolls with a more measured note, but it still &quot;rings through the night.&quot;  Rock on, my lady, rock on.<br />--GFT, Amazon Reviewer--have complained that there is not really a &quot;hit single&quot; track on this album, and in a sense that is true--nothing here jumps ahead of the pack.

The bell has a deeper tone, and it tolls with a more measured note, but it still &quot;rings through the night.&quot;  Rock on, my lady, rock on.<br />--GFT, Amazon Reviewer--
0316096199|2.0|It was with relief that I discovered that I was one of many &quot;skimmers&quot; of this book. I would have discontinued after the first twenty pages if I did not have to read this as a (albeit poor)reading group choice.The inability of the author to differentiate between important and less important detail led to a flat narrative. This is one of those times when, to have allowed a few things to remain unsaid, would have added greatly to the impact of the story.<br />Another reviewer has referred to collateral damage, and this aspect of this book horrifies me. There may be &quot;veiled&quot; references of which I am unaware. I am aware, however, of one instance in which a family which has also suffered tragedy, is accurately named. An encounter with them is described with crudity, and the family tragedy is rehashed, seventeen years later, when there are still family members left to read and remember. Why? I am at a loss to undertand why Ms. Sebold's tragedy entitles her to wound others who wished her no ill. Is this still a part of her own illness?<br />Ms. Sebold is &quot;lucky&quot; to live in a country in which the press is free; publishers generous and in which forgiveness still prevails in the hearts of most - especially our parents.
6305428042|4.0|This is probably the most entertaining Halloween movie I've seen.<br />The story is a little bit scary - but not gory or too frightening. The bad witches are quite funny and boy, can they sing! <br />The costumes are wonderful - the music is great. Bette Midler is truly hilarious. (All three witches are hilarious.)<br />It's much more funny than creepy. Definitely lighthearted fun.<br />The only reservation I have in recommending this as a family movie, is that the trouble all starts because a virgin lit a candle in the witches' old house, thus bringing them back from the dead. The fact that the boy was a virgin was mentioned a number of times (he was teased about it by his kid sister.) And so, a couple of my kids then asked what virgin means. Which is a question that can come up around Christmastime, too, so it's not really that terrible. But I wanted to mention it so any parents reading this review are aware of it.
B00005J9M0|4.0|The Pet Shop Boys have a habit of releasing 'minor' albums between their major releases. Between their first and second albums, Please and Actually, they released Disco, a six-track piece which featured no real new material, but rather remixes of previously released tracks (some primary, some B-side works).<br />Between Actually and Behaviour, the Pet Shop Boys released this album, Introspective, another minor album, with six tracks. However, this time there was new material--remixes of two previously released pieces, and four new works. This was done in an interesting format--each of the tracks on the album were in the form of 'extended dance versions', usually the kind of thing one gets when purchasing the single apart from the album. However, to get the tradition 'album' version of songs such as Domino dancing, Left to my own devices, or It's alright, one had to purchase the singles. This was an interesting marketing ploy, and extended the sales and life of this small album far beyond what it otherwise would have had.<br />Domino dancing was released first, and a classic Pet Shop Boys sound took over dance floors worldwide, combined with a Latin rhythm which was also in vogue during the fall of 1988. This had also perhaps the last MTV-hit video for the Pet Shop Boys; after this time, the videos released by the Pet Shop Boys no longer fit the game-show-and-rap-video dominated MTV schedule, although their videos continued to be played extensively on Euro-MTV.<br />Left to my own devices features more of the signature obscure-intellectual lyrics that Neil Tennant has been noted for:<br />I was faced by a choice at a difficult age,<br />would I write a book, or should I take to the stage,<br />but in the back of my head, I heard distant feet<br />Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat.<br />Simple music tracks backing introspective lyrics (perhaps this is how the album came by its title--Introspective).<br />I'm not scared was actually written for Patsy Kensit and Eighth Wonder (not so much of a wonder, in fact!), and was produced as a single for them by the Pet Shop Boys, before Eighth Wonder decided they did not care for the collaboration. (Take note--where are they today?) The Pet Shop Boys did their own version on this album which, while it was not released as a single, fared rather better than the Eighth Wonder version critically and in radio playtime.<br />It's alright was released immediately prior to their tour in the summer of 1989, actually long past the 'hot' time of the album, but served to show the enduring value of the Pet Shop Boys--that their albums can sit on the shelves for some time and lose none of their luster.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Well despite everybody else's negative comments about the Matrix Reloaded, I on the contrary loved that movie and I worked in a movie theatre at the time and I watched that movie over and over and over again and was never tired of it. Even now I feel like watching the whole Matrix saga, especially after playing Enter the Matrix videogame. The only thing I didn't quite like nor understand in the movie was when Neo stuck his hand inside Trinity and pulled out the bullet and regenerated her heart and at first the flying thing was a bit annoying cause he's like superman but now I kind of like it. I mean he's The One, they said he could do whatever he wanted inside the Matrix and obviously flying is what he wanted. Can't wait until Matrix Revolution comes out cause I know I'm going to be glued to my seat.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The movie was too drawn out and boring.  The love scenes between Neo and his girlfriend was cheesy.  Once they played up the romance angle it degraded the quality of the movie. <br />So now Neo is a superhero.  What's so great about that?  How boring!<br />'The Matrix' was definitely original in its concept and special effects.  It played a big part in its popularity at the time.  There was nothing original about 'Matrix Reloaded'.  It was just more of the same and the scenes were too long. Was hoping it would awe us with a better storyline and special effects.<br />Probably wouldn't waste the time or money to see Matrix III if they dare to produce one.
6305291446|5.0|This movie, at first, I felt was just a way of trying to make money off the &quot;Michael Myers&quot; franchise. But, watching the movie, i realized that they really put a lot of effort into it. The movie doesn't have your average &quot;slasher moments.&quot;...surprisingly, no one has sex, which if you look back to slasher films today, people still are having sex, and obviously dying. Jamie Lee Curtis did an amazing job, and the teenage cast, did a surprisngly good job. The plot was good, the story line was good, and you'll really end up enjoying this film, even if you aren't a fan of the other &quot;Holloween&quot; trilogies...enjoy!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|It's easy to see from a number of points why Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" is the biggest selling album of all time. With 50 million units sold worldwide the album sold by the truckload back in 1982. The album is everything you could ever wish for. It has the hits, it has the fun factor, it's relaxing, it's uplifting and it revolutionised the music industry. People in the early 1980's weren't buying records as much as they were back in the 1960's and 1970's, but Thriller sold so many copies that it got people back into record stores buying albums. Michael not only raised his own career, but raised the careers of many other artists.<br /><br />Thriller has sold 26 million copies in the US alone. That is an absolute phenomenon. When you think of mammoth albums, one springs to mind like Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill.\\" That album sold 30 million copies worldwide back in 1995 and was classed a phenomenon, but then you take a look at Thriller which sold almost twice that amount! What must've been going through Michael's head that year has to be beyond what anyone can comprehend. Thriller received a staggering 12 Grammy nominations and won a record-breaking 8. The album also topped the US album chart for an unprecedented 37 weeks. There isn't really much need for me to write a review for this album, because the name speaks for itself, but I will.<br /><br />\\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" opens up the album. This classic charted at No.8 in the UK back in June 1983 and has become one of Michael's most-loved songs. It's a shame that it didn't become a bigger worldwide hit than in actually did, but it's still great. The lyrics are a bit weird, but hey, weird is good! \\"Baby Be Mine\\" is one of the album highlights. This song has a really smooth and soulful beat which connects wonderfully with Michael's sunlight vocals. The lyrics are catchy and the instruments are very classy. \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" is Michael's famous duet with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney. Before I heard the song I had expected more from it because both singers on the song are absolute legends, but it's still a fairly good song. The argument is handled very well.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" is up next, and is perhaps the most iconic song on the album. This song, amazingly, only just scraped into the UK Top 10 back in November 1983, but nevertheless spent almost five months on the chart. Everyone knows this song - whether you're aged 5 or 70. It's a classic in every sense of the word, and deserves the respect it's achieved. And the video? I won't say anything. \\"Beat It\\" is yet another fabulous classic on this album. The theme here deals with gangs of thugs and Michael uses music to solve their differences and make them come together and embrace the beat. It's a brilliant concept, and the guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen is awesome. Yet another fantastic classic comes in the form of \\"Billie Jean.\\" The first few beats of this song are instantly recognisable from anyone who knows what music is. This anthem became Michael's first UK No.1 single back in January 1983 and made him an international icon. The video features Michael in his iconic clothes such as the white socks, the gloves and the shoes.<br /><br />\\"Human Nature\\" is one of my personal favourites on the album. This is a slower-paced song, but it's still amazing. The beat is very recognisable as it has been sampled many times before since it appeared on this album. Michael's vocals are so soft and gentle. It's just perfect. \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" is another brilliant song that is mid-tempo in its style. Michael gives it all in the verses with some brilliant lyrics and his voice complements the instruments very well, especially in the chorus. There's this bit after 2 minutes and 10 seconds that sounds really corny, but it's all good fun! The album closes with the ballad \\"The Lady In My Life.\\" Albums closing with ballads is usually a bad thing when it comes to my taste, but Michael does them so well. Here, he sings about the one lady in his life so affectionately. It clocks in at almost five minutes, and is a brilliant closer for a legendary album.<br /><br />The Special Features on Thriller are very good. We get an extra track, \\"Someone In The Dark,\\" which is one of Michael's slowest songs ever. It's still fantastic though. \\"Billie Jean (Home Demo From 1981)\\" is not very different to the original, and you can't help but smile because as Michael is singing the song, you know that he doesn't even know that when he releases it, his life will change forever. In \\"Thriller (Voice-Over Session),\\" Vincent Price reads his lines from the Thriller rap that we are all now familiar with. He also speaks the second verse which was never featured on the original version. \\"Carousel\\" is another song which was left off the final version of Thriller by the producers because it was said to have been too different in style to the rest of the album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />All in all, Thriller is definitely deserving of the reputation it has and its sales of 50 million are more than justified. If there was any album to be the biggest selling in the world ever, Thriller is easily it. Michael's two most popular follow-up albums to Thriller are 1987's \\"Bad\\" and 1991's \\"Dangerous.\\" Both albums seemed determined at the time to beat Thriller, but combined sales of both the albums don't even reach the lofty heights that Thriller gained! If you don't have this album yet, what are you waiting for?! It's a classic and needs to be in everyone's CD collection. Buy it now and discover just why Michael Jackson is the most famous male entertainer of the past 20 years.ffectionately.

B00008G9JN|5.0|I consider &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; my favorite Jethro Tull album and the best album to come out of 1977, commonly referred to as the &quot;year of punk.&quot; Maybe it's partly because of that punk insurrection that JT's offering is so wonderful. Many great bands of the old order had gone away by the late seventies, as we all know. Others adjusted to &quot;punk rock&quot; (&quot;rock&quot; if you take away all the b.s.) and got back in touch with their roots, with variable results. <BR>But JT shunned the mainstream and ignored the teenagers. They were in their prime and nothing would get in their way. Thank God for that! They took their fans where they wanted to take them, and they wanted to take them to Heaven. I will not try to describe what any of the songs sound like, but I will say that they celebrate life, glorify the earth. It is some of the most uplifting and wonderful music you will ever hear, containing some of the most glorious melodies ever heard. (Of course, I am partial to this album since I've heard it countless times since infancy.) <BR>If you are a fan of Tull's older stuff, which is also great, forget about it if you listen to &quot;Songs.&quot; It is an entirely different experience than what you've heard before. Open your mind and enjoy!
B000002V0Q|4.0|Megadeth has always been one of metal's best acts.  Now, with Countdown to Extintion, they still are.  Here's a song by song review:<BR>1.)Skin of My Teeth: A great song all about (lead singer) Dave Mustaine's suicide attempts, and a decent album opener.  For me, this song is great, but I did get a little bored with it, after repeated listenings.  Still a great song, though. A-<br />2.)Symphony of Destruction: A great song.  Balls to the wall, heavy, strong metal foundation.  Very catchy chorus, and a Megadeth classic. A+<br />3.)Architecture of Aggression: Another heavy song.  A nice little song, with a good chorus.  It starts off with rockets and guns firing (yes, a ripoff of Metallica's One but it works). A-<br />4.)Foreclosure of a Dream:  I love this song.  It starts off slow, then elevates into a catchy rocker.  I love the way Mustaine sings the chorus, and the little riff in there is great too. A+<br />5.)Sweating Bullets:  GREAT SONG.  Very simple, but also humorous.  The chorus is extremely catchy, and I catch myself singing it all the time.  Dave Mustaine's limited vocal range in this song is used to great effect. A+<br />6.)This Was My Life: There's some noticible anger in this song, and the lyrics are quite clever.  Mustaine's voice is a bit high at some points, and does get kind of exagerrated, but it doesn't ruin anything. Good song. A-<br />7.)Countdown to Extinction:  This is an awesome song.  It's meaning is deep, and speaks out against the needless killing of animals.  There are some clever lyrics here, and the chorus is done splendidly, mixed with some great guitar work.  There's a female spoken part in this song, which works extremely well. A+<br />8.)High Speed Dirt: This is a catchy one.  The solos in this song are phenomenal.  Marty Friedman's bluesy solo towards the end of the song is so great, and the little sound effect at the end of a body hitting the ground is a gruesome touch. A+<br />9.)Psychotron: Another good'un.  All about a part human/part robot, Psychotron is simple, but still a very good song, and always worth a listen. A<br />10.) Captive Honour:  Starts slow, then grows, and has a great little courtroom skit.  All about a man in prison.  No really stand-out riffs, but the lyrics are clever. B<br />11.)Ashes in Your Mouth: I think that the arrangement could have been better on this song, but it's still pretty good.  The solos aren't bad, and the chorus is kind of cool. B
B000002KGT|5.0|Before 1977, the world had never heard of a band with so much emotional torment within its members' lives as Fleetwood Mac. Out of the 5 person band, four were either divorcing or splitting up, and the fifth man had recently found out that his best friend was having an affair with his wife. So the recording sessions which led to 'Rumours' were not a pleasant time, but then again, those same recording sessions also created the second highest selling album of all time, capturing some of the most inspiring music ever. <BR>Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie provided the songs, the former couple Nicks and Buckingham having three each, McVie having four. The song 'Dreams', written by Nicks, earned its rightful place at number 1 when released as a single, whilst Buckingham's 'Go Your Own Way', and McVie's 'Don't Stop' both found their way into the top ten easily. Other highlights of the album include Nicks' mysterious 'Gold Dust Woman', McVie's upbeat, 'You Make Loving Fun' and 'The Chain', a song put together by the entire band. Along with several other beautiful compositions, like 'Songbird' and the cutting 'Never Going Back Again', 'Rumours' makes for one of those albums you just can't put away for more than a day at a time. With all the heartache the band members suffered during this time, they deserved the wealth and glamour they received after twenty million copies of 'Rumours' were sold. Don't be found without this album!
B000089RVR|5.0|Since Dido first stormed into the charts with her debut album \\"No Angel\\" back in 2000, she has gone on to prove herself a true artist with staying power. When you can sell 12 million copies of your album after being sampled on a rapper's song, you must be good. No Angel was full of emotion and passion that poured from the pure voice of Dido Armstrong and touched everyone who listened to it in a way like no other artist before her. A follow-up to this incredibly debut was going to be difficult. It has finally arrived, three years later, so what's the verdict?<br /><br />\\"Life For Rent\\" is its name, and it's one you won't forget anytime soon. Most artists have trouble following up a critically acclaimed debut album, but Dido pulls it off easily. The critics have been less generous in their praise for this new album, but the fans make up for this. Life For Rent sold more than 100,000 copies in the UK alone on its first day of release. By the end of the week it had shifted 350,000 copies and became the fastest selling album for six years (when Oasis' took their \\"Be Here Now\\" album to No.1, selling more than 700,000 copies in one week - incredible if you remember that England is one fifth the size of America in population terms). It's no secret that Life For Rent follows a similar style to No Angel in terms of style and production, but this is no bad thing. Why mess with a successful formula?<br /><br />Life For Rent opens with the lead single, \\"White Flag.\\" Perhaps the most popular UK radio hit of 2003, this wonderful ballad is typical Dido. Soaring vocals, flowing strings and sing-a-long lyrics are the highlights on this song about loving someone, but not telling them because it could confuse things. \\"Stoned\\" is probably my favourite song on the entire album. Dido dabbles with electronica on this almost-six-minute masterpiece, which opens with a long drum and bass introduction to get you into the mood for the song. You could listen to it while driving along an open road. It's fresh, it's free and it's deeply atmospheric. The album's title track, \\"Life For Rent,\\" follows and is no doubt single material. It's another typical Dido ballad with all the right ingredients that made her the world's biggest selling British singer. The mellow verses fuse together like steam. You can feel the atmosphere seeping out of your speakers and transporting you into Dido's world.<br /><br />\\"Mary's In India\\" is a fantastic song with a clever concept about Danny, a man who has been left by his lover Mary who has fled to India. Towards the end of the song, we realise Dido has replaced Mary. The song is so slow and transfixed on relaxing the listener. \\"See You When You're 40\\" is definitely an album highlight. The song just starts from no where, and a heavy beat hugs the song. It sounds like wind howling across the top of a Yorkshire moor on a frosty night. A cold and desolate place that is soon warmed by violins, and of course, Dido's voice. \\"Don't Leave Home\\" is truly the centrepiece of the album. This is another typical Dido ballad about new-found love, but with a twist. It comes not in the concept or style, but in Dido's voice. The verses are soft and mellow, but the choruses are a flurry and whirlwind of excitement and grand vocals that reach stratospheric heights. \\"Who Makes You Feel\\" is another good song with some chilling lyrics and some weird instruments. It's not the best song on the album by far, but it's still something different which is always a good thing.<br /><br />\\"Sand In My Shoes\\" is an album highlight. The topic of this song is so new and original, and involves Dido singing about how she's back home from two weeks in the sun. She's glad to be back home, but she still misses the man she fell in love with over there. She sings about not being able to see him and how it's affecting her. The song opens with car sirens and a wonderful guitar, followed by some fast-sung vocals in the verse. The chorus are wonderfully summery, and the mostamazing thing happens as the third minute approaches. This really cool and catchy rhythm kicks in, bursting from the speakers. It fills your soul and you can't help but jump around. Awesome song, definite single! \\"Do You Have A Little Time\\" is probably the worst song on the album, but it's still great. It's a rather strange song from Dido and breaks away from the traditional formula.<br /><br />\\"This Land Is Mine\\" is another fantastic song with hidden meanings and uses metaphors to explain things. Dido sings of herself as some owner of a plot of land - a county or a state. She sings about a man and she is allowing him to rule and navigate this land. It's obvious from her tone and her usual songs that her plot of land is herself and her body. She's letting this man navigate and demand, just as long as he knows the land belongs to her. The guitar is amazing, and the lyrics always make you think. The album closes with the wonderful and epic song \\"See The Sun.\\" Dido sings about her friend, and how she promises that he'll see the sun again after he's broken up with his girlfriend. The lyrics are just so brilliant and typical, and the instruments feel like sun slowly breaking through the clouds. The day becomes brighter and more positive, leading to a wonderful climax that closes the album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />The album actually closes with a hidden track which plays a few minutes after the last track on the listing. It's a rather cool acoustic song, but you can see why it was hidden. It's not that good! All in all Life For Rent is a fabulous album that is by far my favourite album of 2003 so far. It might not be by the end of the year, but this is definitely one of my favourite albums for years. I definitely regard this album to be better than No Angel. I can listen to it more freely, and feel more relaxed in its presence. Dido knows how to make good music, and she does it well. She sings and paints pictures with her lyrics and voice, and you can visualise it so strongly in your head. Dido is a true artist, and her enduring popularity is a testament to this. Buy this album now, you won't regret it.ird minute approaches. This really cool and catchy rhythm kicks in, bursting from the speakers. It fills your soul and you can't help but jump around.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|If you've seen the movie and enjoyed it for the revenge/action flick it is, then the soundtrack will not disappoint.  I love mix of music genres, it's kind of a mix between old western gun fight music (tumbleweeds blowing between gunfighters), then combine that with japanese drums (samurai duels) and then throw in some blacksploitation funk in the background.  Different... yes... but it definitely gets your heart beating, and feet tapping
B000089RVR|1.0|I have been looking forward to the CD for quite sometime. Dido's songs are full of her special tone. The music is never over the top, often deep, and always flowing. Absolutely great stuff!<br />So, why am I giving it a 1 star? Well, this is a CD review. And the CD is truly awful due to the no copy \\"features\\". It plays fine on a stereo, but load it into the computer and you are in for a good kick in the buttocks! Windows systems will be forced to use the player that came with the CD. (This means an entry in the registry file.) It converts the music to (low-priority) MP3 with lots of old fashion static. I thought we bought CDs for the BEST audio quality? That isn't the worst part though. Being a Linux user, I popped the CD in on my Linux computer and it simply would not play. Period. I bought a CD that is useless when I am working. That is a sad thing!<br />I have not tried it on Mac O/S.<br />This 'feature' was designed to combat CD pirating. This is unfortunate, as I believe it will have the opposite effect. When downloaded MP3s are more convenient that the original CD, which one are people going to listen to?<br />Once again, great music! But, be prepared for a hassle if you want to use it with a computer.<br />(Please not that this refers to the UK edition. I have know way of knowing if the US edition is identical. Please check before you buy.)
B000006TRV|2.0|I'm SO sick of people telling me how great this album is. This album is the beginning of the final stage of pf with roger waters as lead songwriter. The loss of roger's father eric &quot;fletcher&quot; waters during WW2 combined with the schizophrenic tendencies of pink floyds previous songwriter syd barrett makes up the plot for the wall. Basicly a story of an individual who loses his father at a young age and slowly slips into very heavy mental health issues. A young man named &quot;pink&quot; (taken from an early pink floyd being asked &quot;which one of you is pink?&quot;) is a young rock star pressured by fame, the death of his father and supposed schizophrenia to isolate himself from people. The story of his life and tribulations is the album. Written entirely by roger waters and later made into a movie is one of the most sucessful pf albums of them all. Very boring and a definite cry for help. &quot;the wall&quot; makes me fall asleep. Lacking the brain bending genius of dark side of the moon. The wall has nothing to offer from the pf of the past besides sound fx. For those of you who mistake this album for physicologic geinus. Re-think and realize this album is boring for pink floyd.......
0060523794|3.0|While this is a good book of an historic turnaround, there is little one can take away and apply.  Between Gerstner's excessive modesty and the way he focuses more on his actions than the reasoning behind them, there is not much to learn here.  Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable story.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans is an excellent movie set in 1757 during the French and Indian war that blends all different types of movies(adventure, romantic, and many more) and makes a great movie overall.  The story follows Hawkeye, a frontiersman raised by Indians, and his two friends, Chingachgook and Uncas, the last of the Mohicans.  Caught up in the war between the English and the French, these three men rescue Cora and Alice Monroe from a Huron war party.  Sparks instantly fly between Hawkeye and Cora setting the whole movie into motion.  This is a very exciting movie that never slows down from the beginning.  The opening sequence of the three frontiersman sprinting through the woods after a deer is particularly effective.  The battle scenes are very effective and surprisingly realistic while the love story does not feel added on like in so many other movies.  The movie, filmed in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, looks beautiful and combined with a great Trevor Jones musical score makes The Last of the Mohicans a can't miss movie!<br />  Daniel Day-Lewis is very good as Hawkeye, the frontiersman who falls in love with the beautiful Cora Munro, played by Madeleine Stowe.  Their relationship is very believable and the focal point of much of the movie.  Wes Studi is equally as good as the Huron chief, Magua.  He is the type of character you just love to hate.  My favorite characters are Chingachgook and Uncas, played by Russell Means and Eric Schweig.  Their relationship, with very few words spoken between them, is a great part of the movie.  The final twenty minutes with Uncas chasing down Magua and then Chingachgook's fight with the Huron chief is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  The fight on the edge of a high cliff between the two men is breathtaking to watch.  Steven Waddington and Jodhi May also star.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation of the movie as well as 12 never before seen scenes added by director Michael Mann.  The Last of theMohicans is a great movie that has something for everybody and should not be missed!
B0000640VO|4.0|I found this film witty and intelligent, encapsulating French culture and humour. It shows the beauty and joy that can be found in helping others, as well as the benefits of courage and coming out of your shell. It's a nice break from typical hollywood films. A film is not a bad film because it fails promote American idealism. I think it's a great film, even if it doesn't try to capture the audience by big explosions, sexy women or popular culture.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|Well i've been an enigma fan for a LOOONG time, ever since its been around. With Frank Peterson long gone it was inevitable that Cretu would do this to himself. (for those of you who might not know - Frank was, in my opinion, the biggest influence behind enigma's signature sound, what so many call \\"the subtle layering of chants and beats\\". for more see Masters of Chant series, AND with remixes with artists as Sarah Brightman et.al.)<br />On this album only a few songs are worth mentioning \\"From East to West, Voyageur, Page of Cups\\" - that's about it. The rest of the songs will take a long time and a lot of effort to get used to. Sometimes i think he is spending too much time in the club-music-rich environment of Ibiza, hence this ever-more-divergent album. Not that change is not good but Enigma today is far from its versitile self of yester years, its getting more and more mainstream, and doing a crapy job at that. From Enigma MCMXC through Le Roi.., it was it was a journey which i enjoyed, Screen behind the mirror was a fine too, LSD had one new song (it was loyalty that i spent my money on that), this one unfortunately is a fork in our paths Mr. Cretu, i'm not rushing to buy enigma anymore, nor do i think this un-cohesive ensemble of left overs from your treasure chest is going to impress any serious fans. And for reasons unknown Cretu is too facinated with his own voice, he is not that good a singer (but to top it all he sings in almost ALL the songs). This is the credits section at the end of the show, NOT the show itself (no disrespect to the credit sections everywhere and the names therein) :-)
B0000047CX|3.0|First of all, I must say that this album is not all that bad.  The songs are all good, though you need to understand Portuguese to really appreciate them.  But having listened to a large chunk of João Gilberto's recorded output (and no Stan Getz beyond this album), this is a disappointing album.<br />It's got to be one of the most overrated albums in music history.  Essentially, it boils down to Stan Getz using &quot;exotic&quot; music he does not understand as a background to long loud solos that don't fit it.  If you listen to the Gilberto's original Bossa Nova recordings (sadly, currently out of print) and compare them to this album, you can't fail to be struck by how the former were very much about rhythm and songcraft, not about masturbatory improvisational soloing as this album is.  The instrumentation and orchestration in those albums is all put in service of the song, and the songwriting is superb.<br />The songcraft, however, is sadly lost for the overwhelmingly English-speaking audience of this album because (a) they don't speak Portuguese (or, Spanish, for that matter), (b) the &quot;translations&quot; of &quot;A Garota de Ipanema&quot; and &quot;Corcovado&quot; are DREADFUL, (c) Stan Getz is too interested in the limelight to lay his musical ego aside and put the song first.  In short, this album suffers from a terrible clash between the sensibilities of its two namesakes; and the Anglophone audience that endlessly lauds it does not even realize it.<br />When you add the fact that Getz made an order of magnitude more money off this album than everybody else on it (hell, Astrud Gilberto reportedly made a grand total of $120 for a night of work), the above comments take on a more disquieting significance: here we have yet another case of a powerful first-world musician exploiting &quot;exotic&quot; musicians to market himself to an Anglophone audience, while never really caring to understand the music involved.  Thus the real underlying theme of this album: the power assymetries between the US and the rest of the world.<br />All that might be excused if João Gilberto sounded good in this album.  But in fact, compared to most of his recorded output, here he sounds absolutely dreadful.  The guitar sounds dead.  There are rumours that Getz had the album reequalized to make the sax sound louder, at the expense of the rest of the instruments; at any rate, there is just no treble in João's guitar.  And his interpretation is just too lethargic.  João Gilberto is the only interpreter I'm aware of who combines &quot;nearly silent&quot; with &quot;immensely funky&quot;.  Yet this album lacks the second element.<br />If you have some reason for worshipping Stan Getz, I guess you don't need my opinion to judge this album.  If, like me, you find yourself rooting for Gilberto in this recording, look elsewhere.
B00006690G|5.0|Don't have much to say that hasn't already been said by others, so I will just respond to a couple of comments.<br />First of all, Obie Trice is not in D12.  D12 = Eminem, Proof, Kon Artist, Kuniva, Swifty, and Bizarre.  D12 used to be Eminem, Proof, Bizarre and Bugz until Bugz was murdered a while ago.  Obie is signed to Shady Records, but is not in any group.<br />\\"His lyrics are on a fourth grade level\\"<BR>Did someone really say that?  Okay, I'll give y'all a sample of Eminem's lyrics from the Eminem Show, and you can decide for yourself whether or not it is on 'a fourth grade level.'<br />\\"Entertainment is changing, intertwinin with gangsters / in the land of the killers, a sinners mind is a sanctum.\\"<br />If you really believe that a fourth grader could write lyrics like that (or any other rapper in the game right now, really), you need to have your head examined.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I thought this was an excellent album after the first listen. I liked every song on the CD, including the ones some of you labeled as trash. If you are considering buying this CD, buy it.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This Special Edition release of The Lion King features a new song (actually taken from the stage production) adapted into the animation. The addition of &quot;The Morning Report&quot; seems very forced, and mostly comes off as irritating. Unlike the other songs throughout the film, which actually in some way move the story along, &quot;Morning Report&quot; seems to have been thrown in just for the sake of adding something for the special edition release. It also, in my opinion, lacks the humor of the original scene which it replaces.<br />However, the DVD contains both the original and special edition versions of the film. And the special features are fantastic. The digital restoration of the film is also great. It looks so crisp and clear compared to the old VHS copy I had.<br />If you are a fan of this film, I highly recommend picking up this DVD. While I didn't care for the new scene in the special edition film, the special features and the restored verison of the original film make up for that.
630522577X|5.0|I love this movie it's based on Bernard Shaws Pymalion.The play is a good read but the movie is great!<br />Hepburn does a wonderful job and the girl can sing. It has a great message the same as in the play &quot;you are what you think you are, and society makes us if we let it. It's sure brilliant and you will be yelling at her to leave the jerk which is very amusing. You'll love this movie, it is a classic!
B000089RVX|4.0|As with most others, I first heard Evanescence with the hit single &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;. Surprisingly, given the amount of airplay this song has received of late, this is actually not one of the standout tracks on the band's debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; - songs such as &quot;Taking over me&quot;, the second single &quot;Going Under&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;My Immortal&quot; are far more memorable. While there is no disputing Evanescence's talent, they still have a long way to go before topping European rockers Lacuna Coil, who sound similar and yet seem to have that little bit extra skill, variety and depth in their albums.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Great music defies all labels.  London Calling is great music.  Standout tracks include the title cut ('phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust'), Brand New Cadillac (an old rockabilly tune recorded as a sound check by the band to warm up before recording), Hateful (about the band's dislike of drug habits), Right Profile (a clever take on Montgomery Clift, whose car accident scarred his famous face, requiring directors to 'shoot his right profile'), Clampdown (fury personified), Death or Glory (more fury), the wistfulness of Lost In The Supermarket  the bonus track of Train In Vain and the epic sweep of The Card Cheat, a tour de force by Mick Jones.  The disc encompasses many styles and will continue to entertain after repeated listening.  No home should be without a copy!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|All you are dumb @$$s, how can u say the Offspring sold out because of ONE SONG!?! that being pretty fly (which is actually a follow up to Come Out and Play anyways)! while 90% of this CD is a PUNK ROCK CD!!!! She's Got Issues isnt a sell out, being its the follow up to Self Esteem, same with Why Dont You Get a Job? being the follow up to What Happened To You? the most u can say is that these 3 songs are poppy, but THATS IT. the rest are all punk and all AWESOME!!! and anyone that compares this to Blink's sell out with Enema of the State can DIE! its just a couple songs u can say are &quot;poppy&quot; but thats it. this is NOT a sell out and the same old awesome Offspring!<br />1. Welcome - (0/10) its just an intro, so nothing to rate really.<br />2. Have You Ever (10/10) - This is a great, powerful typical punk-rock Offspring song! great fast opener!<br />3. Staring at the Sun (10/10) - Very original and awesome punk song!! keeps getting faster!<br />4. Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) (7/10) - While entertaining and a good song, it gets old a bit fast.<br />5. The Kids Arent Alright (10/10) - Most people have heard this and know it is AWESOME!! everyone loves this punk-rock song :)!<br />6. Feelings (6/10) - Features Davey from AFI, its a cover, and its a kinda annoying, my least favorite on the CD.<br />7. She's Got Issues (8/10) - While not the best, this is a good song and a great follow up to &quot;Self Esteem&quot;<br />8. Walla Walla (6/10) - Second worst song on the CD, i dont know its just not for me, a &quot;fun punk song&quot; one could say<br />9. End of the Line (10/10) - AWESOME high quality punk! seems like the follow up to Smash's &quot;Genocide&quot;<br />10. No Breaks (10/10) - the song that got me into Offspring, fast, angry, agressive. It has awesome guitar and vocals!<br />11. Why Dont You Get a Job? (9/10) - An entertaining song, as long as your in the mood for it its really fun to listen to.<br />12. Americana (10/10) - Another GREAT fast punk song! the &quot;whoa&quot;'s in here are great!<br />13. Pay The Man (9/10) - Slow at first, but a really good song, if only the intro wasnt soooo long!<br />All in All: While not the most solid Offspring CD (see Ixnay on the Hombre) this has many of the Offspring's best songs on it, and it is NOT pop! only 3 songs could be considered poppy on this CD!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|The film contained references to many Ramones songs, only one of which is on the CD. Clearly, the producers regard The Ramones as the greatest rock band ever, so why not blanket the disc with The Ramones?
B00008EY9G|2.0|&quot;Identity&quot; is definitely no &quot;Psycho&quot; - not even close, although it does have the motel and psychopathic killer(s). There is more missing in this film than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliance. I had great expectations, especially after the movie's excellent beginning. Creepy opening shots of a criminal mug shot, bizarre childlike drawings, photographs of female murder victims, with voice-overs of a psychiatrist interviewing a very disturbed person, backed by eerie music and a very strange poem, all seemed promising.<br />Then...on a stormy night in the Nevada desert a group of people, stranded by the flooded highway and surrounding roads, converge on a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. (sound familiar?) There's Ed (John Cusack), an ex-cop turned limo driver from LA, and his has-been actress passenger (Rebecca DeMornay); a Mom, Pop and kid who have much more than road problems; a gorgeous hooker; a recently married couple; a very sinister motel owner; and a cop, (Ray Liotta), accompanying a dangerous convict in chains. My initial feeling that the film was doomed was when I noticed that the convict was a cross between Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein. He is ugly, yes, but too funny looking to be really scary. Then I noticed that 3 of the 4 women were all stunning, sexy, wore miniskirts and showed lots of clevage...more credibility lost. I may sound picky, but if the film is really scary, then one doesn't notice these things.<br />Anyway, to cut to the chase, the murders begin, and just like in the film &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; the motel guests are knocked off one by one, in descending order of their room numbers, with their keys placed next to the bodies. It soon becomes clear that every possible suspect is being eliminated. So, who is the murderer?? This is when a major plot twist kicks in, but even with the new turn of events the film does not become more credible, nor do the characters.<br />The plot is hackneyed, even with the 21st century rewrite and surprise ending - most of this has been done before, many times. The dialogue is inane, peppered with four-letter words, although there are a few quips by the motel owner that are kind of funny. He is asked to guard the convict who has just been recaptured after a very violent escape. He says, &quot;I don't know if I feel comfortable with guard duty, per se.&quot; That's as good as it gets. The characters are flat - absolutely no depth. Now some may say there's a reason for this, and there may be. However one still has to sit through an entire film watching cardboard characters running aimlessly around in the pouring rain, mouthing inane dialogue - just to see an unusual ending. This does not make for an entertaining film.<br />The premise is good. But good premises do not always make good movies. This one's a loser. You may get a few scares during the film's run time, but you might leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. I sure did.<br />JANAntury rewrite and surprise ending - most of this has been done before, many times.

B0000024K1|5.0|I listened to this all the way through for the first time in a while last night, and it still scares the devil outta me! Good thing too, since music this powerful, in any genre, doesn't come along everyday. Chuck D. and company threw the rule book completely away and set a brand new standard that still hasn't been topped. Every track here is essential, but my personal favorite is the chilling, intricate, in your face storytelling of &quot;Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos&quot; (I know every word!)you feel like you're breaking out of prison with him! The production by the aptly titled Bomb Squad is astounding, even by today's standards and as noisy and cacophonous as this LP is, it all sounds musical. Angry, defiant, militant and informed, &quot;Nation Of Millions...&quot; is without peer. 'Bring The Noise' indeed!
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King Platinum Edition DVD was announced over three years ago.  Folks, it is well worth the wait.  Shame on Disney for putting this work of art on moratorium for all these years.  Disney is batting 1.000 on its Platinum Edition Movies.  <br />The Lion King is a wonderful story of how the young cub, Simba is deceived and betrayed by his uncle.  Simba runs away from the kingdom to start a new life.  He returns as an adult to challenge his uncle for the throne.  The animation is both stunning and original.  You quickly forget you are watching an animated movie.  The characters are well developed and the film moves along at a fast pace.<br />The picture quality on this THX certified DVD is nothing short of remarkable.  I would say the best animated DVD I have seen to date.  The color is so vibrant it leaps of the screen.  The images are crystal clear.  The picture will blow you away.<br />The sound track is a very well balanced Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  Exceptional voice clarity is noticeable right away.  The soundtrack itself, is legendary.<br />I cannot say enough good things about this movie and this DVD.  I have my beefs with Disney sometimes, but this DVD takes my breath away.  This is how ALL DVD's should be authored.  Thank you Disney.....this was done right.
B000005Z0G|4.0|A Klassic great second album including last word keep ya head up<BR>one of the best in 94.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|This release is totaly empty of emotion and atmosphere, Something that made Enigmas sound to begin with. The deepest the lyrics get are &quot;boom-boom goes my heart&quot;? Come on! It's quite apparent Cretu has decided to trade in his samples of monk chants and atmoshpere for some generic break beats and Cher-like vocoders. It pains me to even write this review after the years of mindful emotion driven masterpeices Enigma has given us, but listen and you will unbelievably see for yourself. It has been a few years since the last album but Im actually hoping this only took the 47 minutes (very short) of cd space to record it, to some what justify the disapointment. This thing has not even tapped my emotions but with a track which ended sooner then it began and happens to be one of the two filler tracks on this thing. Im baffled and cant believe this will quietly ressed next to but not with, the rest of the amazing Enigma back log. Im not even gonna edit my spelling errors on this one. Cretu sure didnt.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have a real thing for beautiful, sultry female vocals, and Norah just fits the bill 100%.  Her style is softer than Aretha Franklin, more mellow than Billie Holiday, but oh so fine.  I am impressed not only with her own pieces, but her covers of other artists songs are really fine too.  'Come Away with Me' is the song that I wanna hear on rainy days when all I wanna do is daydream, sip on a glass of wine, and read a great book.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Well the fifth movie is now out in its own special edition and thats as it should  be--I dont dislike the movie as much as others do because A) I am a Star Trek fan B) the original series and its characters are still and always will be the best, and C) I saw ST V in the old Fox Theater where as a kid I delighted to other Trek films, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Empire Strikes Back (The theater no longer exists).<br />My only problem with it was the thing about Sybok being Spocks half brother--Now that was just stupid--They could have not had that part in there and instead made Sybok and old friend (or even foe) from Spocks childhood--The impact would have been the same....<br />I think they tried to keep the humor that the fourth film had and no one realized that it wouldnt really work because of the nature of the script--And people quit bagging on Shatner's direction please--He did good with what he had to work with and dont give me this nonsense about him directed because of his ego--Look at the two films directed by Frakes, First Contact which was good, and Innsurection which wasnt all that much--So how can you call one move good for its direction when the next one wasnt??--I am rambling now--In any case this isnt a bad movie, and if you are a Trek fan as I am it is essential to own for your DVD collection....<br />I have more problems with Star Trek VI--so I will wait till that one comes out then you will really see me vent....
B0000B1OFL|4.0|First of all I guess I have to mention that I didn't think I would like it because I absolutely dislike Wahlberg's acting 98% of the time, especially after &quot;Truth About Charlie&quot;. But WOW!!! was I pleasantly surprised. A really enjoyable flick all the reviews before me go into such details about all of the actors and I have to agree LOVED the Cast selection.<br />Let's face it I have had a &quot;thing&quot; for Jason S. since {The Transporter} and he continues to catch my eye was perfect in his role as {Handsome Rob} Edward Norton definately is consistent with his acting skills, no surprise there. Seth Green was hilarious reminded me of {Rat Race} but none the less thought he was chosen wisely. Ahhh Mos Def as {Left Ear} I must say that I look forward to more roles for this versatile entertainer and Mark Wahlberg wasn't as bad as he was in {The Truth about Charlie} but he still is pretty stiff. Music soundtrack was GREAT!! The opening Boat chase scene in Venice was EXCELLENT. All those Car chase scenes with the mini coopers were cool and edgy. Storyline kept me engaged, interested and  there were a few funny moments.<br />I would recommend that you purchase this one if you like movies with Car Chases or re-makes.<br />Respectfully Reviewed
0446310786|1.0|This is not great literature, and I avoid teaching it at all costs. It's not even good reading. The characters are black and white two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. The rednecks are evil, the blacks are victims, and the self-righteous Atticus is too good to be true. There is nothing here to examine or explore. Critical thinking skills can be checked at the door. Moreover, if the lack of complexity and verisimilitude doesn't stick in your craw, then the insipid narration of the androgynous Scout will. This novel is popular due, in part, to the fact that the reader can feel morally superior to white trailer trash as he identifies with the demigod, Atticus. Shakespeare, the consummate craftsman of characterization, understood that even the evil (save Iago) have some redeeming qualities, and the good flaws. To Kill a Mockingbird is about as deep as a rain puddle.
B000088E6D|5.0|BEST CD EVER. I am just amazed, I thought there would NEVER be another with the Sinatra gift of song, and along comes Buble'!!!<BR>BEST!!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|If you're tired of all the mindless crap that Hollywood has been dishing out lately, this movie is for you.  The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, directing, and the bizarre presentation of the story leave you breathless.     This movie is constantly taxing your mind (at least my mind anyway).  The first time I watched it I had no idea what the heck was going on, but I was fascinated and I immediately wanted to see it again so I could figure it out.  This is one of the greatest things about David Lynch's movies.  He never discusses in detail what his movies are about, so the viewer gets to interpret them in their own way.  I'll admit though that I actually read some message boards on IMDb to get some idea what the heck was going on.  Once I got the gist it completely opened up the movie to me again.  I've made everybody I know watch this movie, and after a discussion of its story I made them watch it again.  A second viewing (and third, fourth, and so on) is a must.  With all of that said, this movie is still enjoyable from a visual and audio standpoint, regardless of whether you're lost in plot or not (a credit to Lynch and his crew of usuals).    The lead performances in Mulholland Dr. are amazing (highlighted by Naomi Watts at her most magnetic) as are the smaller more eccentric characters (\\"The Cowboy\\" for example) that are classic Lynch.  There are reasons why Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses and this movie is one of them.  If you've liked Naomi in anything you are depriving yourself if you haven't seen this movie.     As for the DVD, there is a serious lack of special features, but the picture and sound are phenomenal.  I recommend watching this movie on a big widescreen with the lights off and the volume way up (oh...and with no distractions, you'll want to pay attention).
B0000028RR|5.0|When I first heard this amazing CD, I was awestruck by the powerful sound. But then after listening to it a few more times I realized how incredibly intelligent the lyrics are. The song Bullet in the Head is a masterpiece. Never have I heard such a brilliant condemnation of the Status Quo and how our society has become lulled to sleep feeding on the commercial and political propoganda we allow to spew into our brains every single day through the mass media.    What poetic genius to describe the propoganda that tells us how we should think and act as a \\"bullet\\" and the mass assault on our ability to think for ourselves as an \\"in-house drive by!\\"     In my opinion, this is Rage's best written and best performed work. If I could have given it more than 5 stars - I would have gladly done so! It's hard not to play this one LOUD.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This movie sets up the stage for what is to later become Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. If you're a fan of The Road Warrior then You owe it to yourself to see the original Max Rockatansky before he became a shell of a man. Officer Rockatansky was a great cop, husband and father in a time when morals and quality of life were on the decline.<br />Some reviewers have mentioned this movie was not so &quot;Post Apocalyptic&quot; or high tech. I must remind you this story is set before &quot;the world went to war&quot;, you have to pay attention to really appreciate this movie, if you do, you'll notice the Main Force (police) has only 5 or 6 cars for a whole county, a police station with giant holes on the roof, and gangs of men who have realized there is more gain by going out on the roads/towns and pillaging than in searching for non-available jobs. This is, quite simply, the beginning of the end.<br />I gave this one 5 Stars as this DVD has changed the way I judge other movies on DVD. The remastering process was done so well, it looks like a movie filmed in the 90's! It actually looks better/newer than my Batman and Matrix DVD's. Lots of trivia too. Something else you should know is that this movie was put together with a budget of $200k odd US dollars, volunteer riders and many rookie actors, and it still managed to become an inspiring cult classic. This was a great low budget film brought to life by the talented George Miller/Byron Kennedy team.<br />Watch this movie along with it's sequel The Road Warrior and you will not be disapointed, you may skip &quot;Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome&quot; because by the time this movie was made, Byron Kennedy, the producer to whom its dedicated, had died and Hollywood's save the -lil' childrens- big budget hype ruined the rest.<br />The intro to The Road Warrior best explains why this DVD is a must see...<br />&quot;To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time.&quot;
B00005JM02|4.0|I absolutely adored Finding Nemo by Pixar!  I recently traveled to the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney, Australia, so this movie was reminescent of the trip.  The animation is absolutely wonderful and really looks like the structures: Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, Great Barrier Reef, etc.  This heartfelt movie makes you feel multiple emotions in less than two hours time.  As the story line begins, you automatically feel sorry for Nemo and his father, Marlin, when his wife is killed.  Marlin then vows to never let anything bad happen to Nemo.  Over the course of the movie, the viewer laughs until it hurts, especially at the greedy seagulls.  MINE!  Overall, I believe that this movie is full of laughter and kindness; it teaches the young and old alike about the love between a boy and his father, while the viewer meets several interesting characters along the way.  <BR>     I'm definitely buying the DVD.  My friends and I, a group of teenagers, loved the movie so much that we saw it in the movie theater on several occasions.  One time, we had such an urge to see and have a few laughs that we saw like an 11:00 viewing on a Tuesday night.  This movie is spectacular, and adults and children can really appreciate its lessons, as well as the laughs.
B000063DIH|5.0|Fear of the Dark is one of my favorite Maiden albums. Everyone sounds great and the songs are really strong. I find that with this record, you have to listen to it a few times and then you will appreciate it. Afraid to Shoot Strangers and Judas Be My Guide are worth the price of admission alone.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This CD has been on repeat in my player since I got it a few days ago. It's a great album with tons of catchy beats and melodies. People shouldn't be misled by &quot;Where is the Love&quot; because none of the other songs on this album are really like it, but in a good way. And for those who think this is a bad rap album, that's because it isn't rap. It's hip-hop and it's awesome.
B00005NKKV|4.0|Ah yes, now THIS is the Simon And Garfunkel that we all know and love.  Much, much better than the country-tinged debut album.  It is here that Simon starts to realize his full potential as a brilliant songwriter, and Art as a breath-taking singer.<BR>The title track is of course legendary, and for good reason.  Everyone knows that it's just the same version from the debut album, albeit with electric guitar and drums overdubbed, but that really takes nothing away from the grandeur of the song.  It's a stunning piece of work that talks about alienation and being out of touch with reality, a subject which Simon seemed to know an awful lot about.  And that vocal melody is just to die for.  \\"Leaves That Are Green\\" continues with the same mood, dealing with loneliness and confusion.  This one features some fantastic harpsichord as well.  \\"Blessed\\" and \\"Kathy's Song\\" are the only two weak tracks on the album.  \\"Somewhere They Can't Find Me\\" is, to my knowledge, the only 'rebellious' song that the boys ever did.  It's about robbing a liquor store and hiding from the cops.  Who'd of ever thought that S&G would do a song like THAT?  Oh well, it's a killer anyway.  And I totally dig that chorus (\\"I've got to creep down the alleyway, fly down the highway\\").  \\"Anji\\" is a nice little acoustic guitar instrumental, but nothing to marvel at.  But very soothing.  \\"Richard Cory\\" is one of my favorite S&G songs ever.  It tells about a man who kills himself because he's poor and greatly misunderstood.  This is very deep stuff (I wonder if there really was a guy named Richard Cory, or if S&G just used it as an example).  \\"A Most Peculiar Man\\" also deals with suicide.  Yes, TWO suicide songs in a row.  Eerie, huh?  Anyway, this song sounds strikingly similar to The Beatles.   But The Beatles are no Simon And Garfunkel, although many people will tell you different. <BR>Now we come to the greatest moment on the album, the Heavenly ballad \\"April Come She Will\\".  Garfunkel's vocal melody isso full of emotion and melancholy that I almost can't even believe it.  Not to mention the chimes of Simon's acoustic guitar, which sooth me into a trance like a lullabye.  Such a beautiful song.  The up-tempo \\"We've Got A Groovy Thing Goin'\\" is a great tune.  And \\"I Am A Rock\\" continues the concept of alienation that was discussed in the first two songs.  Love that vocal melody, Artie.  Love it!<BR>The bonus tracks \\"Blues Run The Game\\" and \\"Barbriallen\\" are both wonderful, melodic pieces of work, but \\"Rose Of Aberdeen\\" and \\"Roving Gambler\\" are nothing special.<br />So this is their first great album.  All I can say is 'buy it'.  It is a magnificent collection of songs and moods that have stood the test of time.  And what a difficult test that is.
0140437312|5.0|I'll keep this brief.  This is an excellent book, as other reviews will tell you.  This particular edition, Penguin Classics, is the one I read, and I enjoyed it all the more because of the endnotes.  I don't know if endnotes are included in all editions, but they definitely helped clear up a few of the more obscure terms scattered throughout the book.  The excerpt of the play at the end is also a good addition.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Amazing and they were a very tight, explosive band - in the early days.  The later footage is excellent, of course. But I prefer the early footage.  They weren't mega rock stars yet, just very talented musicians who really clicked.
0671045865|2.0|Who wants to read 200 pages about a girl wandering around in the forest? And what was up with that wasp guy? How wierd did he get?No offence to Stephen King but I think that he is flat out crazy!He needs to write a novel that actually makes sence! Who cares what a descriptive writer he is, if you dont have a decent plot, than the story in ruined.<br />  I give Stephen King credit for at least attempting to write a decent novel.He is an exellent writer wiht great potential.All he needs to work on is a better plot and story.
0812550706|1.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is about a military school for boys aged 6 to 12. In particular, it's about a \\"genius\\" boy named Ender who's about 30 IQ points smarter than your average adult Nobel laureate. Ender heroically wins fights against other boys, both individually and leading an \\"army\\" of 40 boys.<br /><br />Ender never misses his parents. Occassionally he misses his sister, but he wills himself not to cry or show emotion. Being a genius makes Ender unpopular with the other boys, so he has no deep friendships, just an occasional boy who says something nice.<br /><br />In Africa, thousands of children are taken away from their parents and taught to kill. Read \\"Child Soldiers: The Role of Children in Armed Conflict,\\" by Ilene Cohn and Guy S. Goodwin-Gill. You'll see that real child soldiers don't grow up like Ender.<br /><br />And where are the girls? In Scott's vision of the future, all leaders are men.<br /><br />A friend's mother, who had a Ph.D. and had once been a lab assistant for Crick and Watson, constantly told her youngest son that he was a genius and would someday be the greatest scientist who ever lived. By second grade the boy was having so many problems in school that two teachers asked him to be moved out of their classes. He's now in his mid-30s. He never graduated from college, has never held a job for long, and has little social life.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card has a good imagination and can keep you turning the pages. But I found myself turning the pages despite feeling disgusted by this book. I got three-quarters of the way through and stopped reading it. [...].<br />--<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe, [...]

B0000C7PQK|2.0|I bought this CD yesterday and was pretty disappointed. The songs Voyageur and From East to West are beautiful. The CD would've been good had he let his wife who can actually sing, do more of the vocals. The songs start out lovely, but the second I hear Cretu's voice I cringe. One of the songs on there sounds just like something from N'Sync. To make matters worse the art on the front is burnt into the jewelcase, which of course broke the first time I opened it, so selling it used it not even an option. I'd leave this in the stores and get it off the freeware down the road for a listen, but it is not something to spend money on. I certainly got screwed on this one

076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson continually makes me laugh out loud. My neighbors must think I'm loony. 'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' chronicles Bryson's return to the United States after living abroad for twenty years. Each chapter is actually a column he wrote for a publication in Great Britian about his experiences in the good ol' USA since coming back. He writes about things that have changed since he left, things that are the same, things that are in a state of flux... His exasperation at some things, including his own foibles, is hysterical. There are so many extremely funny passages it would be impossible to try to pick out some highlights. Read this book! Also recommended: Bill Bryson's 'A Walk in the Woods,' another comical adventure.

B000084T18|2.0|since I'll be shocked if he lives long enough to make another one. With all the beef around him and the softer version of himself (Ja Rule), that custom-made bullet-proof vest he sports will get much use. In fact, there is more press about his being shot nine times than about the actual music on this record. Sadly, that's more interesting than the record. Drugs, money, sex, guns, and clubbing...ah, the life experiences of a thug. Most of the song content is repetitious and while some of the beats are hot, it's just not enough. Forget about challenging listeners, 50 would probably get more respect this way if he tried to challenge to himself.
B000099T2L|4.0|After being a Destiny's Child and an Afro Queen in the latest Austin Powers movie, Beyonc&eacute; strikes again with this fabulous album.<br />The cd starts with the #1 hit &quot;Crazy in love&quot; where features Jay-Z. The song besides being a hit is very good it has wonderful rhythms and Beyonc&eacute;'s voice is amazing.<br />&quot;Dangerously in love&quot; has great songs such as &quot;Naughty girl&quot;, &quot;Be with you&quot;, &quot;Me, myself and I&quot; and a very good duet with Luther Vandross in &quot;The closer I get to you&quot;. A nice ballad.<br />The production includes several guests such as Jay-Z, Sean Paul, Big Boi, Sleepy brown and Luther Vandross.<br />This cd is ment to be a hit. It debuted at #1 in the U.S and the U.K, the first two singles had reached #1 and there's more on the way.<br />Beyonc&eacute; is not only beautiful and talented, she really knows how to sing and her voice, lyrics, rhythms and producers are amazing.<br />Good work, really.
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake is the best, you just want to sing and dannce.. it puts you in a good mood..and they are very likable. Tell your friends about them. I love the background music with the trumpets.. its just really good fun music.

0316666343|1.0|If this book had not been chosen for my book club reading, I would have abandoned it in the first third of the book.  I'm sorry I wasted my time finishing it.  It is a shallow tale with shallow characters, none of whom are appealing.  There is too much wonderful literature out there to be spending time on this novel.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This soundtrack blows any other previous Tarantino based soundtrack out of the water.Just the quality and variances in the types of music chosen is phenomenal.I'm opened up to new explorations into my musical atmosphere.The 5/6/7/8's are one of these groups, I must now explore based on their addage to this soundtrack.I was sitting in that darkened movie theatre out in Farmingdale watching, what has to be the best Tarantino send-up since Pulp Fiction.I was glued to my seat and could of actually spent the rest of the evening watching the last half of the Kill Bill.The choice of old Ironside music was also another plus.
B000002IOW|5.0|the cover shows all the meaning of music on here - These bunny's (rabbits,whatever) are sweet and lovely.there are many of them on hte cover.but something wrong is with them...they are all grey and their eyes are sad...<br />&quot;Presto&quot; is  catchy (&quot;chain lightning&quot;),cheerfull (&quot;Anagram&quot;),Sarcastic (&quot;Superconductor&quot;),Melancholic (&quot;the pass&quot;),funky (&quot;hand over fist&quot;),dark (&quot;show don't tell&quot;)<BR>each song is different and it makes this album so colourful and deep.it is not as energetic as &quot;Hold your fire&quot; or &quot;Roll the bones&quot; but surely worth owning.These three guys mede it great!
B00005B36H|5.0|I disagree with the reviewer below.  Aenima was indeed a<BR>phenomenal outing; However, Lateralus is so much more.  Tool made a break from Undertow's metal, and created an enjoyable prog metal union on Aenima.  On Lateralus, they have gone beyond metal to a prog pedestal where only a few bands lie.  Lateralus is more mature, and they seem at ease with this new musical direction.  Keenan is wonderful, Justin lays down some sweet bass, Jones is off in his own unique guitar utopia, and Carey is still a polyrhythmic god.  Only King Crimson and Rush give me this type of fundamental, progressive fulfillment.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Here's the deal: this movie IS redundant, as one of the other reviewers states. It will drop you off to sleep unless you are a.) a competitive bodybuilding fan b.) a Schwarzenegger fan that is interested in what makes him who he is or c.) interested in what makes greatness. I am all three, so the movie is interesting to me, although moments of mid-70's corniness still shine through rather brightly at times throughout the movie. Consider the antiquated parts of the movie as a time warp into another time and take themm for what they are. The real beauty of this movie is watching young Arnold dominate so thoroughly ALL his competition. I'm not talking about the condition of his body, which is of course staggering. I am not a bodybuilding judge, so I can't give a truly knowledgable view of whether or not he was truly deserving of a sixth Mr. Universe title. I am talking about the way he shows that he never really doubts that he will win; the way he completely disembowels Ferigno, probably his main competition in this event; the way he dominates the minds of everyone, by the time the movie is over, from competition to the judges. Simply put, this movie is a treatise on competition. It should be shown in boardrooms (other than the sexist values of the days would likely get someone in trouble), locker rooms and classrooms. The man is a competitor - the original Predator AND Terminator. Get this movie - it's inspiring to watch what one can do simply through force of will.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I'm not sure why this disc is being slagged by the last few reviewers.  It is a great cd, with a couple different sides to it.  Keenan is great, but even if you're not a TOOL fan,  ( you should be)  it is still an incredible effort and a much better outing than MDN.  Howerdell and company are worth your hard earned coin.
B000001FKY|5.0|When pyromania was released, it became an instant success. It was a monstrous hit in the States, selling 8 million. Def Leppard toured the album relentlessly. However, they still didn't break their own country. Shortly after the end of the Pyromania tour, Rick Allen had his car accident and lost his left arm. Rick Allen had a custom electric drumset built for him. The recording for Hysteria started. Despite the album's huge expense and incredibly long time to make (3 years), it started to gain huge success with Animal (which was huge in England). But when Pour Some Sugar on Me came out, Hysteria was recognized as a true classic. They toured relentlessly and the album sold over 17 million. Hysteria is an incredible record. Catchy and intricate melodies, percise and great guitar work, and even great drum fills, Hysteria is what Def Leppard had been working for from the beginning, perfection.
B00006SFBD|5.0|This having been my first Opeth album I didn't know what to expect.  I had only heard a couple songs prior, but I can safely say this album will be playing on my laptop for quite some time.<br />   Firstly I've bought about 4 music cd's within the past week, most of which I have been disappointed with, as they have sounded uninspired and unoriginal.  Opeth's &quot;Deliverance&quot; does not suffer from this.  It is both inspiring and original.  It has a wonderful transitional quality from song to song and each individual song could easily be divided up into many many other songs.<br />   Second, it is true what the others have said.  Opeth is great for death heads and others alike.  I am a combination of both so this album was great as it has a great combination of death style lyrics along with actual singing.<br />   To conclude I would definetly purchase if you're looking for something new and something that sounds completely original.  Great death style along with great voice.  2 thumbs up, 5 stars, great job Opeth.
0783117523|5.0|I cried so much watching this because it is a true life story of GIA. A tragic girl who life is so memorising. Powerful is the word for this. Make sure u have a box of tissue when u watch it cuz you will need it. <br />A true life of what it takes to being a model and all the fame that comes with it. This is a rough business.<br />You will cry ur eyes out then watching Titanic which i cry too.  I am in love with Gia after watching this movie.  DVD version is great!!!!
B00003CXPD|2.0|In the tradition of The Full Monty -great movie-, Little Voice -very good movie- and Brassed Off -good movie-, comes Billy Elliot: the story of a young kid in a little town where the main working resource is a coal mine during Margaret Tatchers governement in England in the 80s. Billy has dreams of becoming a ballet dancer, and has to face all the adversities from his living environment and from his own family to make his dream come true.<BR> Unfortunately, and unlike the previous films Ive mentioned, this film doesnt offer anything new to the viewer. And the directing is amateurish, the character development shallow and the script also lacks subtstance. <BR> This film is a copy of a copy of a copy. Nothing is in here which I have not seen in another film -be it from Flashdance, to Footloose, to Brassed Off, etc., etc.. And as I said, the storytelling, the script and all the scenes are nothing but a bunch of cliches that weve all seen a million times. <BR> I am being perhaps too hard on this movie, but it is because the way it has been overrated. <BR> Too pretentious and cliched, Billy Elliot is for the ones who do not expect much but an edulcorated \\"kid persues dream against all odds\\" kind of film.<BR> The only good thing is the solid acting of the main character, being as young as he is. But forget the rest.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This EP is foreal!!  As most people would say that it is for &quot;grown folks,&quot; all i have to say is that i am only 16, i ahve both her first cds, and i found this cd lyrically and musically superb!!!  amazing!!!  fantabulous!!!  the grooves here are...i have no idea, just, some fo the best i've ever heard.  And at times, it seems some-what haunting!!  Ms. Badu is definitley a danger to commercial music because her underground schtick is fantastic!!!  even with her medium-sized fame, her music and her name still remain mostly unkown to the youth of the world, which angers me!!!  But, i think that Ms. Badu has definitley released THE best album of 2003-2004!!!!  peace and love  V!!!
B000001Y5X|2.0|It's creepy and spooky, it's relatively cooky... <BR>What can I say? The album art is better than the music. Marilyn Manson was SO much better on Mechanical Animals. Check that out.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is an album that doesn't sound like anything else on the radio today. The intro track 'Politik' uses strong bass and piano and sets the tone for the rest of the album. 'In My Place' is a great track with a familiar melody throughout the song. 'The Scientist' is a great usage of piano and does not need a blaring electric to be the foundation for the track. My favorite track goes to 'Warning Sign', starting with a beautiful opening instrumental sequence. The lead singer's voice is beautiful and carries the heart felt lyrics and emotion of each song, especially 'Warning Sign'. Coldplay delivers a beautiful album of strings and piano. Unique!
B00005JMCN|4.0|I don't make a habit of reading bestsellers the moment they come out, and sometimes that's a blessing.  If a movie version does crop up in the intervening year or two it may take me to get around to a former NYT Bestseller, I can judge it with fresh eyes.  Yes, I do believe that nine times out of ten, the book was better, and that perception can sometimes ruin a perfectly good-of-kind movie.<br />As a librarian, I've been hearing the buzz on Laura Hillenbrand's book for the past year and a half now, both from reading the reviews and just from talking to patrons at my library who have read--and almost universally loved it.  I did happen to catch a recent PBS documentary on the Seabiscuit phenomenon in which Hillenbrand was interviewed extensively.  So I guess I know more about this particular books than the 3,000 others on my list of \\"must-reads.\\"   <br />And watching the movie probably tells me even more about this book that I may or may not get around to reading one day.  It's one of those films that is clearly laboring to be faithful to the book that inspired it that it gets a little clunky.  The lengthy expositionary scenes are perhaps the best example of what I'm talking about.  It takes so long for Seabiscuit to actually arrive on the scene, you may start wondering if you're watching the wrong horse movie.<br />There may have been a more expeditious way to show how Charles Howard made his fortune, for instance, or that his first marriage failed after the tragic death of his son.  Conversely, Red Pollard's marriage is not portrayed, even though it was touched upon considerably in the PBS documentary, with his daughter serving as one of the main voices in that film.  Some inclusion of that aspect of Pollard's personal life might have been warranted, since without any reference to adult relationships in his life, he comes across as something of a big (if proud and determined) kid.<br />And speaking of kids, given how frequently twenty-something actors play teenagers, did it really make sense to cast another, younger actor in the role of the adolescent Red Pollard--especially one who looks absolutely nothing like Tobey Maguire?  Has it really been THAT long since THE ICE STORM?<br />Others have already commented on the questionableness of using documentary footage and stills from the period, and David McCullough's voiceovers seem oddly out of place.  I've already seen one PBS doc on this subject, I don't need another.  This kind of movie shorthand is just too obvious.  A more creative way of establishing time and place would have been preferable.<br />I know that fans of this movie are probably already planning to click on the \\"unhelpful\\" button at this point, but ironically or not, I would still recommend SEABISCUIT.  Once the film gets past all the exposition, it picks up its pace, literally and figuratively, and turns out to be compelling cinema.  The performances are all solid, the cinematography excellent.  And you'd have to have a heart of stone to walk out of the movie without a little lump in your throat.<br />SEABISCUIT is one of those movies where a little patience on the viewers' part is eventually rewarded.  During the first twenty minutes or so of the screening I attended, there were people who got up and walked out.  Too bad for them.   As with many a book, and many of the films based on them, it gets better as you go along.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I really don't care about what &quot;critics&quot; say about this film because it is without the best film of 2002 in my opinion. Even though the basics of it are &quot;borrowed&quot; from other books and movies this is, in it's own right, a ORIGINAL piece. People keep comparing it the Matrix when in fact there was no wire work done in this movie,it also has an original fighting style never done on screen, The Gun-kata, which is amazing.Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as the &quot;Cleric&quot; Agent John Preston. You can really see the change as he transforms from an unfeeling machine to a tortured soul brought on my all his newfound emotions. 5 stars!!!!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|MAKING MOVIES is the best album that Dire Straits ever made. Here they take their roots in Dylan, Springsteen, J.J. Cale, the Allman Brothers Band, and the Band, and blend them into their own unique style of jamming pub-rock. There are several significant epics here, including &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot;, as well as some hot rockers like &quot;Solid Rock.&quot; I had the cassette, and now I'm going for the CD, which should tell you how important this album was to rock music. If one Dire Straits album is all you have space for, let it be this one.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|'Bringing It All Back Home' sounds a bit like the work of an artist who had ideas for two albums, but for some reason, decided to put the different-sounding material on one album. Bob Dylan, by 1965, was getting tired of playing &quot;cause concerts&quot; and folk festivals and wanted to play rock and roll. Of course, his stalwart fans at the time hated it, saying he abandoned them, but it was the first major evolution of an ever-evolving artist. 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' uncompromisingly jumps right into the fast rock and roll sound, along with the heavily electric 'Outlaw Blues' and 'Bob Dylan's 115th Dream' (my personal favorite of the album). It isn't until 'Mr. Tambourine Man' that any shades of Dylan's previous work are revisited. As a cohesive unit, this album is miles away from 'Highway 61 Revisited' or 'John Wesley Harding', but this album is a flawless collection of great songs, not unified by any certain sound and is probably the representative, definitive 1960s Bob Dylan album (simply based on the fact that it is more of a grab-bag type work, with heavy blues, rock and roll, ballads, surrealist epics, folk songs, and protest songs; just about every type of 1960s Bob Dylan song).<br />This SACD/CD re-release is very clear and well-balanced. The mix sounds very bright, much like the 'Highway 61 Revisited' remaster, and avoids any kind of fake digital effects unlike a bit of of post-milennium remasters. The guitars are rock solid, the drums crack, and Dylan's voice is right up in the center. One can never truly appreciate Bob Dylan without owning this album. This is exceptional music.
B000084T18|4.0|Now.. Before I start, I'd like to point out to the rock-lovers/rap-haters that I too, listen to what you christen as 'real music', and I too, can spell. But unlike you, I'm open-minded about music, and my music taste varies greatly.. meaning I'm not about to discriminate without reason like you people. But back to the point. This album had too much hype surrounding it.. and doesn't fully meet the expectations surrounding it. I also found I quickly got tired of some of the tracks, but all in all, this album is above average. A lot of the beats are pretty awesome, and there is a good mix between serious (Many men) and fun (In Da Club, P.I.M.P) tracks.<BR>I would have given it three stars, but i took the time to listen to some of 50's older tracks.. and I know he can easily do better than what he did on this album. I was also at a 50Cent concert a week prior to writing this review, and found that compared to on stage, his energy on the album is very absent, which also makes the album boring. But while 50 isn't all that we hoped, he's still pretty damn good.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|This movie, starring Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, is a parody of the fashion industry.  In fact, quite a few fashion personalities appear in this movie.  I was particularly surprised to see an appearance by David Bowie.  This movie basically has just one joke:  fashion models are ignorant and self-absorbed.  The first few times you see it, it's really funny, but after a while it gets old, and you wish there was a little more variety in the jokes.  Ben Stiller does a good job as the wacky model, Derek Zoolander.  However, I found Luke Wilson's performance a little too irritating.  He just whines and whines with his nasal voice.<br />If you're interested in fashion, you'll probably like this movie.  If you're not, you may not be able to get all the jokes.  Of course if you're a fan of Ben Stiller, you should check it out, but if you're not, then you could probably pass on this one.
038533348X|5.0|This is my favorite book that I have ever read. And I have probably read over 3,000 books to date.Although the author states that his book is completely made up of lies. I found it to be a collection of brilliantly expressed truths.I especially enjoyed his insights concerning religion and mysticism.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This record rocks-I don't know how he keeps doing it, but this man as everone well knows is an amazing ARTIST who keeps the listening experience continually interesting. I don't know where he gets his inspiration, but his well is far from dry. I have been a long time Bowie follower,  and this record though it just came out, is already a CLASSIC.  Think of his only peer of his generation who is doing much the same in terms of keeping it fresh and always interesting, is of course Marianne Faithfull- especially with last years KISSING TIME'. With this record indeed Bowie continues to blow us all away.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|There is a song (partial) in the movie that I don't see listed here...it starts off with counting 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and plays for only a few seconds. I've been trying to find this song for YEARS<BR>if it's the one I'm thinking of (something along the lines of &quot;with the radio on..got the FM&quot;. I tried to find it in the credits and did see a reference to John Cale (Velvet Underground)<BR>but I can't find any albums by either with the song listed...I would<BR>be ENORMOUSLY GRATEFUL for any tips/leads etc., and why isn't on<BR>this soundtrack !! Thank you in advance !
6304119046|5.0|People say it's an OK movie with a good plot and good acting, but its hardly the best ever made. Thats because all of the lighting and camera angles and other &quot;risks&quot; of the time were put to use in Citizen Kane. No other movive has broken so many standards in a single attempt. So do yourself a favor and put away the Matrix and Hollywood Homicide and treat yourself to some real cinema.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|All right, bear with me a second- if you were to assign numerical scores (1-10, 1 being crapola, 10 being absolute perfection) to each of the songs on all of Rufus's albums thus far, then average the scores for each song on each album, then rank the albums 1, 2 and 3, then this album could conceivably come in last place.  HOWEVER, so dizzying are the heights that the best songs on Want One achieve, one has no real choice but to declare this the Grand Champeen.  Go or Go Ahead...gimme a frickin' break.  If that song doesn't blow your mind, you just don't like music, bub.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|Other than 'The Piano' which is strickly instruemental Voyager is lacking.  Entirely too much electronica and vocals that are synthetic sounding.  Change prevents artists from becoming stale and there are some good things on the CD.  Most of the songs have a good basic rhythm but are ruined with bad vocals.  I was very disappointed with this effort and will never buy another Enigma CD unless I listen to if first.
B0000024JA|5.0|Method Man, Mr. Meth, Meth-Tical, Johnny Blaze and whatever, Method is 1 of my favorite Rapper from Wu Tang Clan, I love his voice [Indeed], flow and kinda unique style, and his Solo song \\"Method Man\\" in 36 Chambers is AWESOME!!!

B00006S041|5.0|It is easy to be confused by Stevie Wonder compilations. In the nineties, a double CD was released in America titled Song review, while a single CD was released in Britain with the same title and artwork. More recently, a single CD was released in America titled Definitive collection, so (conversely) a double CD was released in Britain with the same title and artwork. This British double CD is much better than the earlier American double CD titled Song review, which had fewer tracks and missed out some important songs. Indeed, this is the best compilation of Stevie's music that I've seen. Even on two CD's, it is not possible to include every Stevie Wonder recording worth hearing, but all the big hits in Britain and America are here.<br />You probably have your own favorites. I particularly like You are the sunshine of my life, For once in my life, Yester-me yester-you yesterday, Living for the city, I just called to say I love you, Sir Duke, A place in the sun, Lately and Happy birthday. Other classics (also excellent) include Superstition, I wish, Isn't she lovely, Ebony and ivory (with Paul McCartney), Never had a dream come true, Uptight and so many others.<br />If you only want one collection of Stevie Wonder music, this is by far the best. If you want to build a collection of his music, this is a great starting point.

B000053W01|5.0|During the seventies, the Carpenters had considerable success in the pop charts on both sides of the Atlantic with their brand of pop music. Richard's expert arrangements and Karen's superb voice combined to create something special.<br />They recorded plenty of original songs but some of their biggest hits were covers. Close to you is a Bacharach-David song, originally recorded by Dionne Warwick, but her version was not released as a single. Please Mr Postman was a huge American success for the Marvelettes (and was covered by the Beatles on one of their early albums). Jambalaya is an old Hank Williams song, while Ticket to ride is a Beatles classic.<br />Of the original songs, Top of the world was never originally intended to be a single. However, Lynn Anderson covered the song and had a major country hit with it. She might have had a pop hit, too, but the Carpenters wisely decided to release their own version.<br />The strangest song here is Calling occupants of interplanetary craft. Whether you like it or not, it demonstrates that Richard and Karen were always trying to do something different.<br />There are so many classics here including For all we know, We've only just begun, Rainy days and Mondays, Goodbye to love, Only yesterday, Yesterday once more and I won't last a day without you. You can't get all the great Carpenters songs on a single CD but the songs here are all excellent. Among the omissions are Hurting each other, Sweet sweet smile and All you get from love is a love song, but if those were included, others would have to be left out.<br />If you only want a single CD of Carpenters music, this is a good one to choose.
B00005M91K|5.0|Tears of joy over this work - just amazing -<br />I can't watch it again enough to accept the power of the message.<br />I think to give away the plot I'd have to share the meaning of life - it's a dynamic collage that toys with temporal perception of humanity and landscape in a same and kind way.<br />It's my firm opinion that one should not be a person without seeing this and if I was God or Arnold I'd enforce that -- but I could be wrong - and fortunately for the rest of us, I am neither.<br />But I am certain that anyone of whatever bent watches this, they will become a more aware person.  Again, Tears of Joy watching such a crisp capture of the universe unfolding as I type.
B00005AQE8|5.0|It was nearly impossible for 2pac to create a bad album and that's why he doesn't have a single bad album. You can dislike 2pac because of personal biased reasons. Though this is rare, you can go from Japan, Russia, Europe and Latin America all you find is true and real fans of Tupac Shakur. To get back to \\"all eyez on me\\" the double album is profound and historic in the rap industry. It contains many great songs like \\"Life Goes On\\" \\"Only God Can Judge Me Now\\" \\"I Ain't Mad At Cha.\\" Basically 99.9 percent of the CD is amazing and worth every dollar. It has songs with various messages, beats and ingenious lyrics which won't let you get bored, ever! Also recommended \\"Me Against the World\\" and the 2pac \\"Greatest Hits\\".
0804106304|5.0|At first this is just another mother-daughter book, about the generation gap and the immigrants' problems and struggle to be accepted to learn a new culture and keep their own identity. If the book was only that it would be good, but the beauty of Amy Tan's `The Joy Luck Club' is beyond that. She is not afraid of going really deeper in her novel.<br />Using her own background, Tan was able to build a story with a universal appeal. The main line of narrative follows he generation differences between for Chinese women who immigrated from China to USA in the 1940s. These women although being living in Western for over 40 years, somehow managed to keep their Chinese identity, history and traditions. On the other hand, her daughters are typically North American. This would bring a lot in anyone's plate to talk about, but the writer brought the daughters' and mothers' individual problems, and all they have faced that made them what and who they are.<br />Tan's style is nice and easy to follow, albeit there are 7 narrators in the novel, each one telling her story, and how it influence --or was influence by-- her mother's or daughter's.<br />You don't have to be a woman or a Chinese-American to like this book, and even identify with the characters. This is where Tan's prose reaches the universal appeal that so many writers lack of nowadays. It is an interesting book written with the heart, and also the brains.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I thought this was a magnificent sequel to the first Matrix. It gels well with the first one and doesn't take off from the story one bit. The special effects blow your mind and there's just no movie out there like it yet...<br />Yeah yeah yeah so I hear that everyone's complaining about certain scenes in the movie. Like the Zion underground party, get your sex on every few seconds scenes. But honestly, I think they were a necessity. There's a lot of symbolism in this that many critics are overlooking. This whole saga is the story of man versus the machine. Machines with such sophistication and eloquence yet incapable progression capacity really needs to counteract the sense of the human's primal nature, their will to live, their will to fight for their life and their will to die for their cause. I think the underground Zion scenes exemplify this. There's a more humanistic side to this. The first one was all about detachment from the machines, but it was still over-run with the theme of control by the them. The Matrix Reloaded is more or less the exact opposite. It's expressing the human qualities that the first one couldn't...<br />So even though Morpheus' speech needed work..I'm still glad they didn't cut the Zion segment. <br />Overall it's a great movie. The third one though...oh boy that's gonna be a doozy...
B000002JS0|5.0|This is an amazing AC/DC album. It is easily one of their best with songs like \\"Long Way To The Top\\" \\"T.N.T.\\" and 'Rock And Roll Singer\\" how ccould not but love High Voltage. It has to low points, only highs. AC/DC's first album being one of their best because it is strpped down, has great guitar by Angus and Malcom and the drumming on bass is a good as it ever was, and Bon's voice is amazing! Angus blew me away the first time I heard 'Rock and Roll Singer' i mean his bluesy swagger on that song is amazing, perfect pitch and it proves why Angus is one of the greatest guitar players of all time. Every song is a winner her, all killer and filler I guess you could say! High Volatge has the best AC/DC song of the Bon Scott era, Its A Long Way To The Top If You Wanna Rock And Roll, no other song of the Scott era can top this song! This is AC/DC at their rawest and most passonate, you'll love this!
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's 1992 self titled debut explodes out of your speakers with angry, passionate vocals from Zach De La Rocha, huge riffs and inventive solo's from Tom Morello, strong basslines and occasional slapping bass from Tim Commerford, and skillful drumming by Brad Wilk.<BR>Zach de la rocha is energetic throughout the whole album, bringing across his angry yet intelligent political lyrics by rapping with his fierce voice, and this man has done his research and you'll find you will learn quite a bit from the lyrics. He screams from the heart in such classics like 'Wake Up' and 'Freedom' both of which are accompanied by the great musicianship from the rest of the band.<BR>Tom Morello is at his best on such huge riffed tracks like &quot;Know Your Enemy', the classic 'Killing in the Name', 'Bombtrack', and 'Freedom', plus each song has a fantastic guitar solo, all of which are completly original and different to each other.<BR>Tim Commerford and brad wilk are a strong pairing in backing up the main men, Morello and Rocha; Commerford's bass doesn't take the centre stage often, excluding the slapping bass in 'Take the Power Back', but it provides more 'oomphh' in morello's riffs. Brad Wilk never really does anything that is eye-catching, he's just used to keep everything in time for the rest of the band, and to make head-banging a little easier.<BR>This is an essential album, an explosion of anger morphed into one of the greatest albums of the 90's.
0688152023|5.0|I am not a dancer, but this book has taught my body to be more flexible. Non-dancers in general are tense and tight, not using the proper muscles to support their back. But if you go through this book with an open mind, it will help immensely to straighten and strenghthen your posture. (Not to mention all the flexibility you gain!)<br />I have heard that this book is difficult for people with no ballet backround. I had no problem with it. The notes explain enough for you to do the exercise properly. As long as you have an idea of what your body can do without hurting itself, you should be just fine.<br />The excercises are meant for building strength and flexibility in your muscles. The stretches feel really good! And the more I do, the more flexibile I become. I love it!<br />I love this book. You will too!
B00005O3VC|5.0|The good news first. The first disc has the entire film and it looks great. There aren't any extras (except for a couple of minor jokes)on disc one. All the extras are on disc two. This is the bad news portion of our program.<br />Through some demon's work, the second disc won't always run on Panasonic Progressive Scan DVD players made in the year 2003. Perhaps it's a time warp or, perhaps, it's a way for Columbia to get you to buy the extra-extra-extra Special Edition that will probably come out next year or the year after. Either way, you can't access any of the special features and have to reload it a couple of times. The good news is that inexpensive DVD players by Samsung and the like will play the second disc without any hesitation.<br />Perhaps it's a design flaw in the disc, or, more than likely in the Panasonic player.
B00004Z459|3.0|As seems to be the trend these days, Linkin Park delivers a heaping serving of teen angst poetry set to music with their debut album, Hybrid Theory. And with it comes yet another devestating blow to the credibility of mainstream rock.<br />Everywhere I go, I hear people rave about how beautiful and deep Linkin Park's lyrics are. As a writer myself, I can appreciate how much effort goes into rhyming and whatnot...but the lyrics themselves just aren't deep. They sound pretty, sure, but they're not real and they contain absolutely zero emotion except 'woe is me, I hate my life.' If you think these lyrics are deep, then I'd like to direct you to the poetry section at fictionpress.net, and - with any hope and luck whatsoever - you'll come to the realization that lyrics Linkin Park produces are a dime a dozen. Check out the notebooks of any &quot;misery-stricken&quot; highschooler, and you'll find some sort of angsty poetry. Now, set that to music, and you'll have the essence of every single Linkin Park song written.<br />The music is original at least, for I haven't heard too many bands who have mixed rap and rock and pulled off something that didn't sound like someone beating a cat in a bag with a piece of plywood (though that's what Chester's screaming sounds like sometimes). Some of the tunes are quite catchy, and even I caught myself humming them when I wasn't paying attention. Despite of this, however, all of the songs sound practically the same. After listening to the album, I can see why &quot;In the End&quot; was so popular: it was the only one that offered anything really different. <br />I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who has a shred of respect for their own taste in music, but if you're being made fun of at school because you listen to pop, I guess you should probably try this album.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|If you didn't already know better, you'd swear this was one of those masterful Disney Platinum Edition restoration and packaging jobs. Amazing things were done with both the video and audio to make a great movie even better. I have always enjoyed this movie, in the theater, on Laserdisc, but this DVD makes me feel like I'm seeing a whole brand new film. I can't believe how good the audio on the old TV clips sound, and the newer concert footage just couldn't be better.  This much care for the fans and the end product put a lot of newer music releases to shame (not naming any names--Sir McCartney.)<br />This is the way a Rock movie should be done overall--songs play through and no one talks over them! The camera edits don't jump and cut every 3 seconds either. I love having the multi-camera angles on the two songs. Now I can just watch Keith and still not know how he plays like that. Even better is having solo OX bass audio to enjoy (he doesn't do that much in Baba unfortunately, but Won't Get Fooled is incredible.) I don't know who it was that ever started that nonsense about the Stones being the &quot;Greatest Rock Band&quot;, but all the proof you need that it has ALWAYS been The Who--is right here. <br />No more DVDs should be allowed to be released before they live up to this quality standard.
B000002GYN|3.0|I don't think it would be right to say that the Eagles burst onto the scene with this album. That isn't to say it's not a good album, far from it, it just doesn't set the world on fire.<br />Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner launch the Eagles with a laid back country rock album that has a good sound. The album's two best are Glenn Frey's \\"Take it Easy\\" and \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\". Both are great, uncomplicated specimens of pure country rock.<br />Nothing else really stands out on the album but there are some good tracks nonetheless. \\"Most of Us are Sad\\" is a simple ballad and Randy Meisner does a good job on \\"Take the Devil\\". Overall, it's a competent offering but it's simplicity masks what was to come from the Eagles.
B000075BFK|5.0|It's funny that even though these are all leftovers which didn't make the cut to an official album, still is better than most (if not ALL) people's REAL albums.<br />If you're a fan of 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Zeke, Master P &amp; No Limit and does not own a TUPAC album u need to slap yourslef silly and buy at least one album from the guy which inspired these acts (a little too much if u ask me)<br />The best posthumous release from Tupac is STILL I RISE but this is the second-best.<br />Best songs are: &quot;They Don't Give A F*** About Us&quot; which emobodies politics, &quot;My Block&quot; which sounds a whole lot like SCARFACE's song wtih the same name, hmm, &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot; music for the soul &amp; &quot;Who Do You Believe In&quot;...<br />LOVELY STUFF

0736689702|1.0|I bought into the hype over this book and approached it quite eagerly as it promised intrigue and devious puzzles and carefully researched history. Boy, was I disappointed!  Dan Brown's writing is annoyingly repetitious (how many times does he use the phrase &quot;the sacred feminine&quot;?)  He also has the irritating habit of telling the reader that he is withholding information just to make the reader wait.  It's one thing to withhold information; it;s another to tell you it's happening.  The former can lead to well-crafted suspense. The latter is just a crude attempt to be suspenseful.  And the puzzles that are supposed to be so clever are pretty obvious - simple anagrams and basic ciphers.<br />This is all compounded by the awful narration of Paul Michael who drones on and on with but a modicum of inflection.  Even at the most harrowing moments (there are a few anyway) he never communicates any sense of danger or excitement; just a matter-of-fact recitation of Brown's prose.
B00009RGBS|4.0|I really like Chicago. Yes, it's dark and no, there aren't many sympathetic characters, but it's fabulously energetic and clever. I was impressed by the singing and dancing skills of the leads, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, and I thought that the way the movie was put together was great. Chicago is not just a superficial musical with people breaking sporadically into song, but the songs - seen through the mind of Renee Zellweger's Roxie - compliment and add new levels to the story and the themes. Richard Gere's performances during the courtroom scenes were especially well done in this way, and my personal favourite was the puppet scene. The costumes are great, the dancing is professional and the songs are fantastic. The scene where one of the inmates is hanged is an admittedly sobering part, but is an important contrast with the rest of the movie. I could understand Chicago winning the &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar, but I was a little skeptical of Catherine Zeta-Jones' win. She was great, but she didn't seem to be in the film all that much to win an Academy Award. However, Chicago is definitely worth watching and will probably end up being studied in film studies classes.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is excellent for adults and kids alike.. But i think especially for teenagers.. cuz i am one. This movie is so much fun, yet sometimes you get scared. My favorite scary part is when sarah jessica parker sings a song to get all the children so they can steal their souls.. it has a very haunting melody.. &quot;come little children I'll take thee away.. into a land of enchantment...&quot; very creepy but an A+ movie!
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Put simply, if you're one of the two-and-a-half people left on the planet who hasn't seen Mildred Pierce yet, do yourself an enormous favour and get it immediately. Joan Crawford is nothing short of remarkable, and, for once, the director and producers have done the smart thing and extracted an understated and beautifully-shot performance from La Crawford. The supporting cast, in particular Eve Arden, are a treat, and Max Stein's score is, by now, legendary.<br />Also, Wonderful Wonderful Warner Bros. have given Joan fans everywhere a wonderful gift with the B-Side of this DVD; there's almost a 90-minute documentary on Joan which is one of the best movie-star documentaries ever made. It explores all aspects of Joan's life, from the heady flapper years to the alleged child-abuse to the lonely finale of the life of the Absolute and Unquestionable Queen of Hollywood's Golden Age. Get this now.
B00009MGQL|1.0|Jeff Beck hasn't released anything decent since &quot;Wired.&quot; He has forgotton what the words &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;melody&quot; mean. He's totally into noise and gimmicks. I saw him live recently on an A@E BB king special and he couldn't even play a simple decent blues solo.( all noise and gimmicks) That's sad. He used to be my favorite guitarist. Remember the dark burgundy Les Paul on the cover of &quot;Blow by Blow&quot;? I was the last person to own that guitar before he bought it at &quot;Strings and Things&quot; in Memphis. I know what I'm talking about.

Over the top, grandiose, bombastic you name it, Muse is it.  They also happen to be brilliant, one of the great UK rock bands (and theres many great ones too).  This is a disc that is just continually surprising and endlessly listenable.  Seek this one out and then pick up Muse's astonishing follow up- 2003's Absolution, which is the best thing I heard in '03.  Muse just blow me away.

0743517849|5.0|I listed to this book on CD during my commute to and from work. I found it to be most enjoying and educational. I knew that some wealthy people do no seem all that wealthy (e.g. Sam Walton) but I had no idea that the majority of the affluent were so frugal. A definate eye-opener!! Even though I am far from being wealthy I definately got some great new insight on how to get there and am already making personal changes.<br />A MUST READ for anyone looking to get a new financial perspective.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|There's just not much more that I can say that hasn't already been covered in one of the previous reviews.  Basically, I have been a music CD and DVD collector since they came into existence and this is simply the best rock DVD I have ever seen.  I haven't even made it to the special second disc yet!  There is just so much to see and hear in the newly restored film itself. Is this the best Who documentary ever?  The answer would have to be, in Pete Townshend's immortal words \\"Ummmm....yeah.\\" (If you don't get this joke then buy this DVD and watch the film NOW!)
0792843584|3.0|I have just watched the 2 part VHS-version of this film (Oct, 2003). Given that the main story line is so similar to everyday news now, it wasn't as eye-opening or revolutionary for me as it might have been in 1980 (and, I don't mean to devalue the social justice issues). I became interested, though, in the story of the woman (Ella, the brothel owner) whom two men &quot;wanted&quot;. Nate - up until then a &quot;bad guy&quot; (killed the poacher Michael Kovach) - loved and wanted her enough to ask her to marry him (though we never understand why he didn't try to save her earlier from her fate on the death list). Jim Avril (for the most part a &quot;good guy&quot;) asked her several times to &quot;leave there&quot;, &quot;come away with him&quot;, etc. Eventually, Ella tells Jim that Nate had asked her to marry him ... long pause, but Jim seems only to be sucking on his pride (or something); he won't do the same. We aren't sure why not (is he married?). <br />This story of what a woman wants was potentially a great story. Though we saw much in Ella's face, her dialogue was restrained; she didn't beg Jim to act but didn't make a display of sorrow - which I assumed she felt. In fact, his behavior bordered on cruelty - though, by the end, we have to consider that there may have been limits on what he could do.  A photo of him with a woman, on his bedstand throughout, actually led me to believe that it was his shrine to a woman whom he had loved and lost (died, possibly?).<br />The tension, for Ella, lay in her need to hold on to what she had (Jim called it merely &quot;things&quot;), but it was her security; possibly salvation from an earlier, hopeless life. She couldn't trade it for vague promises. I waited for him to open his eyes to what she needed, what he would lose, how he needed to act. Much later, she seems to have acceeded to go with Jim- but only because she had run out of options. We are not sure if we see resignation in her face (she never says much). Then,a &quot;doubly&quot; sad ending which finally ends with Jim having to settle for less - something he previously expected Ella to do.<br />A flawed movie, yes, but well worth watching.
0345446798|2.0|Well, if you want to know more about her own dogs, this is the book for you.  Yes, there are some important behavioral issues, but it would of been nice if she would of used her client dogs as examples rather than in EVERY chapter something is mentioned about her Border Collies and their behaviors.....yawn.  Anyone who has had dogs in their lives will agree that they ALL have their own personalities, even those from the same litter.  Can't say that I gained much from this book!  So, if you want to read about her farm dog's behaviors and herding sheep get this book, otherwise don't waste your money.
0201633612|5.0|I have heard numerous accounts from programmers of varying experience levels on how this particular book and set of concepts changed the way they approach object-oriented software. Object-oriented software is about object interaction, implementation is trivial in a system where a reasonable framework is set. <br />Good object-oriented design, it is true, existed before Design Patterns was introduced, but it is the way object-oriented design was given a set of commonly agreed intuitive names of generic object traits that this piece of holy software scripture earned its place in the 5-star-league. By discussing and using agreed concepts, the processes involved with design, implementation and refactoring can be exposed to a much broader audience, because applying these naming conventions in code implies desired functionality. The approachable, yet rigorously thought-out guidelines in this book further makes reviewing code more efficient because comparison against tested design approaches can be utilized, pointing out many common pitfalls.<br />A word of caution. This work is very inspirational, and junior level programmers might, upon leafing through this book, emerge even too enthusiastic on applying generic design on systems where simpler approaches would be more logical.
B000002MTR|5.0|This CD is the Chili Peppers' 1995 album with Dave Navaro from Jane's Addiction playing lead guitar.   And man can he play guitar.  The songs on this Cd show the unbelievable talents from all of these guys.  Flea is doing his funkiest stuff, Anthony is rhyming off his amazing vocals, Chad is drumming his heart out, and dave is rocking away.  This CD is probably the Chili Peppers' best album with such songs as Warped, Aeroplane, My Friends, Coffee Shop, Walkabout, Tearjerker, Shallow Be Thy Game, and others.
0375713751|4.0|Just finished reading this book & in common with at least one reviewer I didn't want it to end.  I was drawn in from from the start and as Kate's life unfolded, the writing style was so witty, fresh & full of verve that I laughed aloud many times. But I have to admit the laughter was tinged with a rueful, even bitter edge and I waved the book in front of my male & married colleagues accusingly demanding \\"Is this how it is?\\" & actually found myself getting angry at \\"a woman's lot\\" all over again.  I'm single and no kids but from many years spent in an office environment and simple observation I recognised the essential truth of many of the situations Kate the heroine finds herself in, both in her work and home life.     BUT....I found the denouement of the novel to be a major disappointment.  Very contrived & dependent on a clumsy \\"deux et machina\\" device (I've only recently discovered what this phrase actually means and am delighted to have the chance to use it!), it cheapened the experience of reading the novel, which up to then had been exhiliarating and thought provoking.     Thankfully far removed from dreaded \\"chick lit\\" (a genre I do my best to avoid) this is a funny and engaging read but be prepared to be disappointed by the lacklustre ending.    P.S. regarding the inevitable cinematic adaptation (bound to be inferior...) wouldn't it be fun to have Georgous George Clooney play Jack Abelhammer, Kate's ardent email suitor, rather than just resemble him?!
B0000A02U2|5.0|To make a long story short: I absolutely loved this movie.  It will tickle your funny bone time and again, it's John Belushi at his very best.  The end is hysterical with the Deltas destroying the parade. So grab a copy of this dvd and take it home and let John Belushi bring down your house. Enjoy. I always do.
B000067CPX|2.0|Man o man...anyone that claims this is the best of the Chili Peppers is NOT a Chili Peppers fan. The basslines are transparent, the vocals are...well let's just say Anthony needs to go back to rapping his bad@$$ funk rhymes, not singing about wind. The Zephyr Song is arguably the worst track RHCP has ever produced, with its intensely poppy chorus. And riddle me this...why isn't the opening lick played on the bass?!? RCHP is not, at least in my eyes, a pop alternative band. They're a hardcore funk-jam band, and this shows but a feint shadow of that. Blood Sugar Sex Magic is still the way to go, and anything before Californication, for that matter...which did have its moments, but definitely of declining quality.
1558908846|4.0|Who couldn't like this slick, sleek, happily depraved and utterly self-contented violent romp in the near future? It's got Sly Stallone in a fine, full-bodied role as the fascistic Judge Dredd---and hey, He's the Law! You got a problem with that? You got objections, Perp? He KNEW you'd say that! (sound of Perp being knocked unceremoniously in the head by Judge Dredd's side-arm).<br />Let me count the ways I love Judge Dredd:<br />1)It's all Action, all the time---and it Looks so Good! And best of all, it's action done by a competent, experienced crew: Adrian Biddle (\\"Aliens\\", \\"1492\\", \\"Thelma & Louise\\") for cinematography, and set design by Peter Young, who did the look for \\"Batman\\" and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".<br />2)It's got Armand Assante and Jurgen Prochnow as crazed, Machiavellian evil villains (Assante crazed, Prochnow Machiavellian)!<br />3) It's got veteran uber-actor Max von Sydow as Chief Justice Fargo, and boy the guy looks hip and happening in a trenchcoat with a big super-duper hand cannon!<br /><br />4) It's got a violent Mega-City where the angry inhabitants don't have backyard barbecues, they have block wars!<br />5) It's got an angry War Robot designed to control crowds---with extreme prejudice! Oh, it likes to pull peoples' heads off, too.<br />6) It's got angry unfinished Clones, all of whom are imperfect copies of Assante!<br />7) Aspen, Colorado is a penal colony! What a great world!<br />8) It's got starlet action! A villainous Joan Chen in tight leather hotpants! It's got the genetically perfect Diane Lane as the unfortunately named Judge Hershey (I don't know. Don't ask.)!<br />9) It's got a periodically amusing Rob Schneider and gratuitous Balthazar Getty! It's got a family of inbred religious cannibals who make the family in \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" look like pikers---and the razor-toothed Number 1 Son has what appears to be a minute-timer embedded in his skull!<br />10) Finally, it's just all around fun: the chase on Lawmasters through the neon heights and aeries of Mega City One has to be seen to be believed, and it is far more enjoyable than anything in the Star Wars prequels. And in addition, it's a pretty fine adaptation of the Judge Dredd graphic novel series.<br />So get past your need to see 'serious' cinema, sit back, and pop \\"Judge Dredd\\" on the hopper. Besides, He's the Law----and failure to appreciate the subtle glories of this film is a Violation, Citizen---Punishment? You don't want to know.neon heights and aeries of Mega City One has to be seen to be believed, and it is far more enjoyable than anything in the Star Wars prequels.

6304578482|4.0|This movie works because of the amazingly good natured attitude it takes and the wonderful chemistry of the leads.  Kudrow and Sorvino are great together - you can really see them as buddies and comic foils for each other in a very natural,  comfortable way.  Kudrow, in particular, is hysterical.  This is not a major film or weighty classic - but it is a great fun, fluffy, funny - mega-rewatchable feel good comedy.  Garofalo is absolutely perfect as the surly loser and steals every scene she is in.  For a good simple fun - HIGHLY recommended.
1563894696|5.0|How about a good old-fashioned murder mystery for Halloween this year? Set in the early years of the career of the Batman, the Dark Knight is on the trail of a serial killer who is picking off the members of Gotham City's preeminent mafia family one at a time, bringing the tension in the underworld to the brink of a mob war that threatens the entire city. The killer is sly, murdering only on holidays, beginning with a brutal murder one lonely Halloween. Loeb crafted a brilliant mystery story in this volume, and nobody but Tim Sale could have illustrated it. This is the tale that made these two men comic book superstars. I defy you to read it and tell me they haven't earned it.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This is an amazing recording showing what miles can really do when set free from the boundaries of conventional jazz. His work with John Mclauglin is amazing and shows what can happen when two great jazz/fusion legends work together. The person who gave it one star is stuborn and cannot get over the fact that this is different from a normal jazz or fusion album.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album defines Rage Against the Machine. Zach De La Rocha's intelligent lyrics are infuriating and inspiring like no other singer. Tom Morello's unique and recognizable guitar playing prove him to be the most talented guitarist of the nineties. Every song teems with anger, emotion, and the truth. Buy this album.
B000066NW0|5.0|I've seen and read many negative reviews in the past done by these so-called anti-Avrils, stating that Avril is a poser, or she is a disgrace to all punk bands. I'm just going to tell you, this is a CD, not a poster of Avril, which you may judge. It seems like everybody here is judging her looks and putting a stereotype on her, and not paying to close attention to the albums content. If you're going to give this CD a star, don't do it just because you hate her as a person, because that's just plain shallow. There's a good chance that if you hate Avril as a person, then you are going to love this CD. If you are considering buying the CD, read my grades. I loved this CD. If you love Michelle Branch or Alanis Morrisette then you are going to love this CD! Meh grades:<br />1. \\"Losing Grip\\"- A+ [single]<BR>Good song, kind of pop, kind of rock. Really pop in the beginning, then turns to rock. About a breakup (like many of her other songs) and betrayal. It was also a single on the radio for a short amount of time. <br />2. \\"Complicated\\"- A+ [single]<BR>You've seen the music video, you've heard it on the radio, it's a single. Beautiful song. Enough said.<br />3. \\"Sk8er Boi\\"- A [single]<BR>A cute song. It's rock/pop song about a girl and boy that secretly both liked each other but the girl would never tell. It's also got a lesson to it. At the End, Avril sings about having a relationship with that boy.<br />4. \\"I'm With You\\"- B+ [single]<BR>This is a nice, winter-y song, that would be beautiful if Avril worked on it just a little more. It's got a nice violin when it's played, but towards the end Avril sounds like she's getting out of tune or possibly shouting.<br />5. \\"Mobile\\"- A<BR>Awesome song, awesome guitars. It's about moving away and leaving everything behind, and about changing. A song almost everybody can relate to if they ever moved before.<br />6. \\"Unwanted\\"- B<BR>Good the first few times, but definitely not her best. Like \\"Losing Grip\\" its kind of about betrayal,but its guitars are much harder, and the lyrics are not her best, and are a little on the strange side. <br /><BR>7. \\"Tomorrow\\"- B+<BR>Not the best song either, unless you're in a bad mood, because this song is just slow. Just like \\"Mobile,\\" it's about changing (sorta) and carries the \\"I'm not ready\\" message. The only instrument really played is the guitar in this song.<br />8. \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"- A+<BR>A very nice song, that's about being weird (and maybe just not fitting in). The lyrics are a little strange, but the song overall is very cute. It's kind of like Michelle Branch's \\"You Get Me.\\" One of my favorites on the CD. <BR> <BR>9. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\"- A+<BR>Cute song, with nice guitars in the beginning. Sure, it's a little juvenile, but I admire her way of writing this one. Anybody who has a crush can relate to this one!    <BR>  <BR>10. \\"My World\\"- B<BR>This song is about Avril and her growing up, but I really think she doesn't need this song tacked onto this CD. Not the best song on the CD, it doesn't reflect her talent.<br />11. \\"Nobody's Fool (If)\\"- A+<BR>This is a fun, half rap, half pop/rock song. Nice guitars in the beginning, and Avril does a good job with the rapping. I usually hate rap, but when Avril does it, it's good! It's about somebody trying to turn her into somebody else. You need to \\"step up\\" and sing this one!<br />12. \\"Too Much To Ask\\"- B-<BR>Not the best song on the CD, either. It's probably the worst song on the CD. The lyrics aren't the best, either... it could use some work, and her voice isn't her best. It's another song that's about not being true to yourself.    <br />13. \\"Naked\\"- A<BR>This is one of Avril's more romance-like songs. It's about ... yeah, you know. :P It's kind of pop, though- but it is a song about a deep relationship!   <BR>               <BR>Enjoy! And remember to check for Avril Lavigne's 2nd album (she promises it will be more 'rock-ish'), coming late this year or early 2004! ;)
0812550706|5.0|This book is just plain amazing. Every page makes you want to turn to the next. The characters are deep and interesting and the plot has its share of twists and turns. At the end of this book, you will be satisfied, you will be amazed, you will have a feeling of sadness and content. Sad for a little boy, taken away from his parents and his ciblings to be turned into a monster in order to eliminate a once violent species that no longer is hostile towards earth. You will be sad for Ender. Of course, only people who have read the book will understand the last couple of sentences, so read the darn book.
B00006690G|1.0|The way this guy cusses and talks extremely fast over a messy beat makes me want to hurl. It's the saddest thing in the world that teenagers and some young adults think that THIS is \\"cool.\\"  I'm a preteen, and I DO NOT think that this is the definition of \\"cool.\\" Maybe it's just me, as a 12-year old, has a better taste of music than any ordinary 17-year old, who LIKES this trash. Why can't this guy just go back to jail, where he belongs? He only teaches teenagers rudeness and disrespect. That's what rap does. I'm sorry, but I have to announce this Eminem has no talent. Talking fast and cussing isn't a talent, nor is it music. I don't feel sorry for him either. <br />It scares me that people play this on the radio, and it makes it to the top 10 hits. It also scares me that only ¼ of SMART teenagers with great musical taste hate this stuff. Hopefully this nightmare will be over in a year or so when this kind of music goes bad, just like what happened with bubblegum pop, and everybody hates it and doesn't listen to it anymore. 50 Cent, Nelly, and especially Eminem all need to GO AWAY. Why can't people just SING, not rap, for once? I'm just glad that we have great pop and rock artists with REAL talent, like Michelle Branch, Evanescence and Avril Lavigne; otherwise our music world and its industry would die.
0446310786|4.0|A book that covers everything from the lose of innocence to racial tensions in the 1930s, To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect novel for all ages.  I really enjoyed this book told through the eyes of a young girl.  the only reason why i did not give this novel a 5 is because of its very slow start. It was kind of hard for me to get into it at first. Once i did get into the book at aroung the 3rd chapter, I could not put it down.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|First off let me say I can understand why alot of people don't like this movie. It's incredibly deep and although most won't admit it, they had no idea what was actually going on. If you don't understand some of the philosophies behind it, and complex ideas such as Predesination, you're simply watching an empty futuristic action thriller. But the deep philosophy behind it, is what makes it great. The reason that many were dissapointed is that the movie was hyped to be the &quot;Best Action Movie Ever&quot;, and it delivered, but not as much as it did intellectually. It's also just the 1st half of what should be one movie, so you're sort of left in the dark. Now, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the absolutely tasteless scene in Zion with Neo and Trinity. I was with some friends, and it was one of those moments that makes you embarrassed to watch. Completely unnecessary. If you can skip that scene and look past it though, you're in for a great ride.
B0000844IT|3.0|AoD &quot;Boomstick Edition&quot; comes with two DVDs.  One contains the theatrical release.  The other contains a director's cut.  The theatrical release of Army of Darkness is an excellent movie.  A must for action and horror lovers.  The director's cut, however, is a disappointment.<br />For much of the added footage its quite clear why it was cut out.  Pacing and timing.  With the extra clips in place some of the timing on the jokes is wrong.  For example, in the theatrical release after chopping up Bad Ash we cut immediately to Ash with a sack pointing at it reproachfully &quot;that'll teach ya&quot;.  In the director's cut, Ash has extra two lines between chopping up Bad Ash and making the joke.  The timing is thrown and it falls a little flat.  In other cases the new scenes add little to the movie and only serve to throw off the pace.<br />Worse, some of the classic lines have been removed.  Ash, looking out at the army of the dead appraoching, says &quot;Maybe, just maybe my boys could pull it off. Yeah, and maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot&quot; has been replaced.  The classic &quot;Good.  Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun&quot; is gone in favor of the flat &quot;I'm not that good.&quot;<br />The film quailty in the director's cut is inconsistent.  Sometimes crystal clear, othertimes dark and grainy.  Oddly enough, the worst parts are those that appear in the theatrical release and some of the best quality scenes are those that are cut!<br />The alternate ending (I won't give it away) is downbeat, cheap looking and obviously just leaving things open for a possible sequel.  I can see clearly why it was cut out in favor of the famous final supermarket battle.<br />There are a few, scenes here and there which benefit from the extra footage.  Ash's hilarious fight in the windmill with his tiny doppelgangers has been greatly extended, however its shown with no music greatly detracting from the comedic feel.<br />Overall, the director's cut is not as good a film as thefinal release.  This looks like one of the times that test audience feedback helped make a better film.  I would not recommend purchasing just to get the director's cut or to see the extra footage.  If you can get the theatrical release alone for less, do so.  This is why I give the Boomstick Edition only three stars.  Were it just the theatrical release of AoD, I would give it five.
B000002J09|5.0|So, what shall we call Led Zeppelin's fourth album? \\"Zoso\\"? \\"Four Symbols\\"? \\"Runes\\"? \\"Untitled\\"? Heck, let's just call it \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\"! Zeppelin's classic 1971 release is understandably named by most fans as their definitive album. It's got \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" on it, so need I say more? No doubt about it, \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" is one of THE greatest rock albums of all-time. Not only do the band totally rock out on Zeppelin classics like \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Rock 'N' Roll,\\" \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" \\"Four Sticks\\" and \\"When The Levee Breaks,\\" but they also display moments of tremendous musical beauty, not only \\"Stairway\\" but also the mandolin-fused \\"The Battle Of Evermore,\\" and the acoustic showcase \\"Going To California.\\" The band's songwriting and musical interplay throughout is nothing short of outstanding. It's as if the group *knew* they were on a rock 'n' roll mission in making this album. And about \\"Stairway To Heaven\\"---what makes it such an enduring, all-time FM radio favorite? Well, besides the fact that it's simply a magnificent song, I think it's because it's got *everything* Led Zeppelin were all about in a single tune: some truly hypnotic guitar-playing from Jimmy Page, Robert Plant's powerful lead vocals, awesome keyboard-playing and basslines from John Paul Jones, and John Bonham's legendary thunder behind the drumkit. The poetic lyrics, the beautiful build-up, the hard rocking second-half & conclusion, it's all there in \\"Stairway.\\" And although \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is by-and-large the album's main attraction, *every single song* on \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" stands mightily tall next to it. It's no wonder this album remains the band's biggest seller---Led Zeppelin totally outdid themselves with \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" unquestionably a brilliant every-home-should-have-one rock masterwork.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters hits the jackpot with this magnificent performance.  Not sure how to describe it except to say it doesn't sound like anything or anybody else.  Only Waters could have composed and performed this original and captivating work.  Memories of Pink Floyd flood through the performance, complete with sound effects and background narrative by a retired soldier.  A powerful opening of 'What God Wants' sets the tone for things to come and it only gets better.  Do yourself a favor and curl up in a dark quiet room and don't let anything interrupt as you take a journey through the mind of one of most talented musicians/lyricists ever.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time!!everything about the movie is great.but one of my favorite things about the movie is that it didn't have to use alot of cheesy special efects like say the Matrix(hate that movie)and underworld.I am sure you have read enough reviews about the film so you might as well go buy it.
B0000025ZF|4.0|With Roger Waters now operating on his own, apart from Pink Floyd, for the first time, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The test of a true artist comes under these circumstances and Mr. Waters has proven his worth to the world of music.  &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; is not a series of songs, but more like an opera - 1 long story running 40+ minutes.  It takes multiple listenings to get the message, but once you do, you appreciate Rogers as a true artist, able to stand on his own.  Though not classic &quot;Floyd&quot;, it's easy to see the prior connections to the band.   He may have been testing the 'waters' with this first solo effort, but the talent that helped carry Pink Floyd to stardom is not lost.  Take my advice, go to a quiet room, plug in some good headphones and give &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; a listen.  You won't be sorry.
B000089CJI|4.0|Is that a good thing or a bad thing, you ask? That all depends on how much you like the PSB. But if you are not a big fan of them, the Postal Service still offer enough updates on electronic beats that can make a great listen. This Cd is one of those that you can leave in the CD player for heavy rotation.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I loved Willow. It was one of my all time favorite 80's movies. It was one of the first we got with our VCR and I'm so glad it's on DVD. Willow is a magical movie made by two of the all time greats in George Lucas and Ron Howard.<br />Willow tells the story of the the midget Willow who must help save the world. He has a princess baby that is being hunted and must die according to the evil queen. Willow gets help along the way from Mad Mardigan(Val Kilmer) as they must keep the baby alive and stop the evil queen.<br />That's the basis of the story in short and sweet detail. It was written by George Lucas, and is basicly Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. It's fun for the whole family. Lucas is yet to do a movie the whole family can enjoy.<br />Warwick Davis is amazing in the movie. He plays the lead character Willow. He is a great actor. He has depth and isn't one sided. It's hard to believe after seeing him in this that he later became the Leprachaun in that series of horror movies.<br />Val Kilmer has one of his all time best performances as Mad Mardigan. He's basicly a fantasy Han Solo. He is the greatest sword fighter to ever live and probaly the greatest womanizer. Val portrays all the great qualties a hero needs. He's charming, helps the weak, funny, sarcastic and he just delivers. It's a must see for Val Kilmer fans.<br />The action is great in Willow. It's not the blown up special effects you see in Lord of the Rings, but it is great for it's time. The castle sieges are done well and it's great seeing all those guys in armor and on horses. The choeragraphy on the sword play is fantastic and is underrated in Hollywood history.<br />Willow is a must see for all fantasy movie fans. It's a charming well made movie that is fun for the whole family.
0060926317|1.0|If you must purchase this book, please buy it second hand in order to prevent this woman from making any more cash from the incredible lies that she is peddling. There is enough misunderstanding concerning the nature of Aboriginal peoples history and culture without Marlo Morgan adding her 2 cents, if it is even worth that much, worth. If you want to take seriously the word of a woman who appears to put Cane Toads in Sydney, or Native American Dreamcatchers in the hands of Indigenous Australians then go ahead and read this book. I seriously doubt that she spent any time at all with Aboriginal people, and she has in fact admitted to fabricating the bulk of this new age fantasy. If you want to get some picture of the actual experience and knowledge of Australian Indigenous people, then read something written by them. Sally Morgan (no relation) and Alice Nannup are just two to get you started. The Aboriginal culture of Australia is rich and vast enough without Ms. Morgan needing to untruthfully and self indulgently embellish it!
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses at one time was the most popular band in the world, and this was the album that started it and made them the best. Appetite has it all. Guns N' Roses was such a complete band. With Axl's awesome voice and Slash on the guitar, you will really enjoy it. I love this whole cd. It's got there hits. Everybody knows Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child of Mine. I like Night Train a lot as well. The whole cd is a musical masterpiece and a must for all music fans.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Naysayers only criticize this album because they know the unbelievable music Maynard James Keenan and friends have put out and hold them to the highest possible standard. This album is more musical than most anything you'd hear on the radio today. It is vastly different from Mer de Noms, which is another reason people say bad things about it. A lot of people don't like their bands to change. But I love evolution. I think its a truly fantastic album. I've listened to it over and over again and still love it. The emotional intensity of Noose is palpable, and songs like Vanishing and Gravity give me chills every time I hear them, much like Orestes from Mer de Noms. Not many of the songs I would call &quot;single&quot; material. Most of them are winding journeys of beautiful music but they aren't tight little packages that the radio likes, with the exception of Weak and Powerless and maybe Pet. <BR>This album reassures me that A Perfect Circle is second only to Tool in modern artistic rock.
0790734850|4.0|L.A. Con fidentail is great movie. It deserved the Oscars it won. I have to admit I first saw the movie because I do like Kim Bassinger. She had me hooked from the first time I saw her in Batman. She is fantastic and so dang hot. This is a great tail of murder, mystery, and betrayl. Just watch the movie for the acting. Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe are fantastic. They are easily two of the best in the business. Guy Pearce also has a great performance. He's so great he suprised me he was so bad in The Time Machine. You got to see L.A. Confidential. If you love murder, betryal and mystery then it's the perfect movie for you.
1559409010|5.0|No doubt the Monty Python group is one of the funniest tv-shows and movie-makers of all time. Their straight-faced, intelligent kind of humor is so everlasting that today, roughly 25 years after their three main movies were made, they still have a huge legion of worldwide fans, and among them very young people, some of them born after their movies were released.<br />In \\"Life of Brian\\", the setting is Judea, around 33 A.D. The movie is about Brian, a jewish man-boy, raised by a tough mother; Brian's life is seemingly meaningless, until he joins a hilarious group whose main task is to go against Roman domination. Suddenly, and unwillingly, Brian has an enormous set of followers that, based on strange omens, think he is the Messiah.<br />From beginning to end, \\"Life of Brian\\" is much more than just a bunch of nonsense scenes revolving around a common base-point. Of course, the characters are made and chosen to fit the Python actors, but that doesn't mean the acting is bad. John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones (among many others) are still active and very much well-known today or in recent years - 007 series, \\"A fish called Wanda\\", etc.<br />But \\"Life of Brian\\", more than a simple comedy, is a tremendous criticism of the society we live in. It is not blasphemous in any way. Countries and societies that have banned this movie on religious grounds completely missed the point. This is not about religion, it's about people's relationships. To criticize globalization, lack of individualism and misguided leaderships (if they were able to see the problem then, what can we say about nowadays, when it's even worse?) they took as an example the christian societies and religious movements because, being westerners, and making a movie mainly for western audiences, they thought this would be more simple to achieve their goal. Well, in the end it was proved they were really ahead of their time. Even today \\"Life of Brian\\" is not completely understood, and mistaken as a religious parody.<br />Congratulations for the Pythons, on the subject choice and on the intelligence with which the movie was made.<br />Grade 9.2/10a religious parody. <br />Congratulations for the Pythons, on the subject choice and on the intelligence with which the movie was made.<br />Grade 9.2/10
B00005RYLE|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. My first expierecne with the two was with the show  Hercules: The Legendary Journey's. I've seen since a lot of Sam Raimi's work including his blockbuster hit Spiderman. But this movie is so great because it shows us a young Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just haveing fun.<br />The Evil Dead tells the story of five college age kids who go to a cabin in Tennesse to do what college kids on breaks do. They end up staying in this weird cabin. They find in the basement of it a tape recorder and a book. The book is the book of the dead. There is a tape recorder and it is played. On the recorder is a chant that releases terrible evil on our 5 college breakers and the rest is history.<br />Bruce Campbell is great. The story, effects, acting, and plot are so cheesy. Not everyone can play that kind of role and Bruce plays cult hero Ash to perfection. He's funny as anything. You don't know what he's going to expect next from the zombies and it had me laughing so hard seeing some of his reactions. He is even better in Army of Darkness.<br />The special effects in Evil Dead are great. They are so cheesy and lame it's fantastic. There is so much blood and gore it's funny. Does a zombie really have that much blood. The contacts the people where when they are zombies are great too. The slapstck with the fighting of the zombies is great too.<br />Evil Dead is a fantastic movie. All the members of the cast helped the crew build sets, do effects and set up shots. It's a great movie made by some great people just wanting to have fun making fun of b-rated horror movies. Watch The Evil Dead and I'm pretty sure you will like it too.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|i've been enjoying Greendale since it came out -- frankly, more the live, acoustic DVD version, to which i give 5 stars. Who has the directness of presence except Bob Dylan (who's focused more on poetry than Neil, but perhaps has expressed less of the kind of genuine human vulnerability that most of us feel much of the time?) to do such a thing?<br />What a characteristically homely concept album for Neil. Check out all of \\"Earl's\\" psychedelic paintings in \\"Lenore's\\" gallery at [...] I haven't read anyone's observations yet that refer to this dimension of the Greendale concept. Perhaps they're there, but I just haven't read them. Anyway, do check it out if you haven't already.<br />That said, the two songs I really think are better with CH on the CD are the last two, \\"Sun Green\\" and \\"Be The Rain\\". Why hasn't anyone noted the deliberate echo of Norman Greenbaum's \\"Spirit Of The Sky\\" in the guitar tones, erstwhile solos, and generally boogieing of \\"Sun Green\\"? Like it's not there?<br />Anyway, Greendale is an a-maze-ing album but, personally, I think it's another impassioned throwaway from the man who -- while not as directly influential as Bob, The Beatles, The Stones and Jimi (not necessarily in that order) -- has through his own uniqueness contributed very much to the general vision and vibe of what these archetypal artists mean. Why do people keep writing Neil off, as he obviously and justifiably enough dicks around with us? My guess, is that the best is yet to come. Part of his main message is longevity, and it's a rather important one.<br />Anyone willing to disagree at this point?
B0000844IT|5.0|Army of Darkness is a remarkable movie. It comes from one of the best directors and producers in the business in Sam Raimi, and it has one of the most underrated actors of all time in Bruce Campbell.<br />Army tells the continuing story of Ash and his attempts to end the world of the evil the book of the dead has brought. He gets transported into the past, and must get home. To get home he must retreave the book of the dead. He accidentally releases a great evil and the war is on.<br />I love the special effects in Army of Darkness. The zombies hold to the silly tradition started in The Evil Dead. The skeletons reming me of the skeleton in the lipton ice commercials. I also love the brownie Ash's and seeing Ash seperate into Evil Ash.<br />Bruce Campbell once again steals the show as Ash. The poor S-Mart employee is better equipped in this movie with his shot gun and chain saw. Once he starts leading the natives against the skeletons, it's like a yankee in king arthurs court. It's great and predictable, but thats whats fun about it.<br />Army of Darkness is a great movie. It's funny and is a great horror spuff. It will leave you laughing crazy.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I had the awful feeling that I was going to hate this movie when I popped in this DVD for my inaugural look at the film. But my initial apprehension toward the picture vaporized almost instantly upon watching the film's first scene.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how much I liked this movie.  In my view, Director/Producer/Writer Cameron Crowe has done the near-impossible with this motion picture.  That being: He's taken a group of people that could have been so easily looked down upon and intensely disliked, and instead turned this assorted band of musicians, groupies, mothers, sisters, and rock-n-roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun-to-watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.<br /><br />Add to this mix one very likeable-right-off-the-bat young 15-year-old would-be music journalist (played to perfection by Patrick Fugit), and what you have in your midst is a highly-entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul-searching, friendships, and chasing dreams.<br /><br />Every scene in this film is a memorable one. The whole movie feels \\"real\\", in this writer's opinion. Nothing seems faked, or phonied, or Hollywoodized. A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto-biographical, with Fugit portraying Crowe when Cameron was a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.<br /><br />And while it's rated \\"R\\" (for language and drug content), the film never once bogs itself down with the cliched rock band negativity of drugs, sex, and booze.  Sure, these elements are shown through Mr. Crowe's camera lens; but it's never displayed in such a way as to be a turnoff.  If this film were in the form of a book, it would indeed be described as a real \\"page turner\\".  The viewer anxiously awaits the next \\"page\\" (scene).<br /><br />There are two scenes in this film that are true \\"set pieces\\" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time).  One such piece occurs as the fictional band with which our talented young \\"Rolling Stone\\" journalist (\\"William Miller\\") is travelling encounters severe turbulence on an airplane flight taking the group to its next concert date.  As the severe thunderstorm batters the plane to the point where all aboard are nearly convinced they'll soon be meeting an untimely demise, one by one the passengers begin to confess their inner-most secrets and indiscretions. This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.  As the aircraft finally breaks free of the turbulent air, much to the delight of the exuberant pilots, our band of passengers is too mentally drained from the confessions they've just offered up to each other to join in the celebration of the fact that they are, in fact, going to survive the ordeal.  The scene concludes comically with a member of the group, who has just informed everyone of a dark secret concerning sexual orientation, slamming the cockpit door closed to silence the cheers of the pilots.  Great, great scene!<br /><br />Another highly-memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.  Elton John can be heard on the bus radio, singing \\"Tiny Dancer\\".  Gradually, the vehicle is filled with singing, as everyone begins joining Elton in belting out the tune.  This scene is one to play over and over again, as the feeling of togetherness and harmony fills the bus at that moment.<br /><br />The DVD presentation here is as flawless as the film contained on the disc.  Picture quality is exceptional via the nice 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic transfer. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's an adequate Making-Of featurette included as well, which contains several photos of a young Cameron Crowe \\"on the road\\" as a Rolling Stone scribe.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen this picture who might be thinking (as I did before viewing it) that this is a movie filled with loud, obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that \\"Almost Famous\\" will pleasantly surprise you.<br /><br />These characters are well-written, never \\"over the top\\", and totally engaging from the first chapter of this DVD until the last.<br /><br />It immediately has zoomed into my Top 25 of all-time favorite flicks!<br /><br />I still can't believe how truly good this movie is.  It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening., obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that \\"Almost Famous\\" will pleasantly surprise you.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I've always had a really hard time comparing radiohead albums. I certainly don't think it's appropriate to compare Amnesiac with The Bends or Pablo. If you happen to like either of those, that means nothing in the capacity of predicting your enjoyment of Amnesiac. I can't even handle comparing this to Kid A, and they were recorded in the same session. All I can say is that I listen to this album habitually, and I still want to listen to it all of time. What a wicked band...when you listen to radiohead, you sometimes wonder why you even bother listening to other bands.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Quit your fu¢king belly aching!<br />This album is a fantastic testimony to the staying power of the greatest heavy metal band around.<br />Some of these (1, 2 and even 3 star) reviews are absurd! <br />Maiden is a fantastic band. They are great song writers, fantastic studio musicians and one of the best (if not THEE best) live acts around.<br />Dance of Death, simply put, is one of the best albums the band has put out. Each track  offers something unique. It's great music. If you have an open mind about it, you will love it.<br />For all of the \\"fans\\" out there who question the band's chops and keep making references to albums the band but out in the 80's... please pull your heads out of your collective a$$ holes!<br />Quit living in the past and enjoy what the Maiden of 2003 have to offer!
B000002GK1|5.0|This album personifies the genre of grunge. It is very raw and certainly not elegant by any stretch of the imagination. Typically, when I put on this album, a majority of the people I'm with are so disturbed by Chris Cornell's range and screaming power that they want to shrivel up and die. That's not to mention the purposly over-distorted guitar that often doesn't have a shred of traditional musical formation. These guys remind me of  a hair metal band from hell. I'm quite certain that any one in the human race will be doing themselves a favour by checking out &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; on this album...It is awe-inspiring to say the least.
B00000GBHA|5.0|Being born in the mid-1980s, I never experienced the social impacts on white South Africa.  But having worked in South Africa for big hunting safari companies (with many &quot;Rhodesian war vetrans&quot;), for the past three summers, I have listened to this CD countless times while driving a bakkie (Toyota Land Cruisers, of course).  Road trips from Dwaalboom to Colesberg, supply runs to Thabazimbi, and when Jacaranda 94.2 doesn't work in the bush... it brings back my own memories of Southern Africa and because of that I LOVE IT!!
B00004XONN|5.0|i don't think I've ever seen another album split people to the extent that &quot;Kid A&quot; does. I remember that, upon its release, radiohead fans were divided into those who uproared about the lack of rock and the weird noises, while others proclaimed radiohead as musical gods. I'd put myself in the latter of these two groups. I wish there wasn't such a snobby undertone to the Radiohead fanbase, because it makes it very awkward when I tell people, &quot;Radiohead is my favourite band and Kid A is probably my favourite album&quot;. In this day and age, those may be fighting words depending where you say it. I don't know why I like it so much, I just do. Leave me alone. I'm not a jerk, I swear. I like Hall and Oates too...I'm a very conservative person, honest.
B00006IU73|5.0|I had never heard of PT before, I saw that it was CD of the year on IGN and blind bought it. For $10 this is easiest one of the greatest albums ever conceived. Every track is just brilliant. Definately one of my new favorite bands, just a shame its so hard to find their older records.<br />Favorite Tracks:<BR>Blackest Eyes<BR>Trains<BR>Prodigal<BR>Sound Of Muzak<BR>Collapse Light Into Earth
B00006RU5B|3.0|This album is pretty good...the songs are pretty fun to listen to and Cornell's voice is still incredible. But I think that most people will agree with me when I say that Audioslave is nowhere near as wicked as Soundgarden or Rage. This album isn't very inventive at all. It's good when you listen to it without precedent, but when you realize that Chris Cornell and Tom Morello could probably pop out an album of this calibre on a weekly basis, you realize that it's not very inventive
B00005QG9J|4.0|I've been an incubus fan since the absolutely perfect album, SCIENCE. While Make Yourself was a change from more rock to pop I appreciated the album. Morning View is an entirely different album with far more &quot;pop&quot; songs and just a handful of rock songs. This definately doesnt mean its a bad cd by any means but not up to the calibur of both Make Yourself and Science, but still better than Fungus Amongus. <br />Song Breakdown:<br />1. Nice To Know You: Great way to star the cd off, awesome song. Even better performed live. 4/5<BR>2. Circles: Definately one of the best tracks on the cd. Awesome rock song that reminds you of Incubus' science days. 5/5<BR>3. Wish you were here: One of my least favorites. Got way to overplayed on the radio. One of my least favorite Incubus songs on any record. 1/5<BR>4. Just a Phase: Good song, definately a different sound for Incubus. 3/5<BR>5. 11 am: Another song thats not my favorite. 2/5<BR>6. Blood on the Ground: Surprising song on the album. Good but nothing too special 3/5<BR>7. Mexico: Beautiful acoustic song, definately one of the best &quot;mellow&quot; songs incubus has written. One of the best on the cd. 5/5<BR>8. Warning: Another radio single that I was never to fond of. 2/5<BR>9. Echo: Another beautiful love song. Great lyrics and just an overall amazing song. 5/5<BR>10. Have You Ever: Average song, doesnt bring anything new to the table. 3/5<BR>11. Are you In?: Definately one of the most original sounding songs on the cd. 4/5<BR>12. Under My Umbrella: Hardest wrong song on the album. The opening is awesome and another great song. 5/5<BR>13. Aqueous Transmission: ABSOLUTE Masterpiece, easily one of the top 5 songs incubus has ever written. So unique and original this song is worth the price of the cd alone. 6/5
B000089RVR|3.0|Listen before you buy and you won't be hurt. Skreeching, whinning,talking and music from Uranus. If this and swallowing fresh salmon eggs on toast points make sense to you, then you will love the words and music. There is one good song by Dido, and like most 18 yr olds it comes first.
B00000J7JO|3.0|They had everything going for them. Frusciantes newfound sobriety, Keidi's drive, and Chad and Flea having both reached the height of their talents. And all of that is evident on this CD, but somehow it seems spare. Emptyt. Void of emotion, energy or soul. Do NOT get me wrong, I am a HUGE Chili poeppers fan, but I simply don't like this album. The production is bad...(listen to Get ON Top at any significant volume and then tell me if it hurts your years or not.) The ballads are sung without much emotion (listen really carefully to scar tissue) the bass is neither catchy nor creative (Around the World) and the most dissappointing part....after BSSM you can hear the difference in the creativity and complexity of Johns guitar. Around the World has THREE notes, Scar Tissues Verse has TWO, the only track that doesnt sound liek it was written in fifteen minutes is Road Trippin and even that is boring. This CD is very accesable and got a lot of new fans into the Chili Peppers because it is SIMPLE. The only one of the band who remains true to the effert is Keidis, and even he staggers in his lyrics a bit, (Get On Top, Right On Time). I am even more dissappointed in the record after listening to By The Way. Cant Stop is infinately better than Around the World, the gutiar playing on Cabron is stunning compared to even Californications best: Road Trippin, I Could Die For You and Dosed are tons inporved on Scar Tissue and OTherside. Yet people like Californication more, and thats because it is accessable. Not good, but accesable. They could have done better and they did, I regard Californication as somewhat of a \\"moneymaker\\" CD to support the band, as opposed to By The Way, which was really music.
B000003N7K|5.0|I first heard this in 1975. I believe that this is the best record album ever made.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|A reviewer on 10/11 asked about a song; I haven't seen  the film, but from what the reviewer said I really think it's the song &quot;Roadrunner&quot; by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.  I'm a huge music fan and I don't know any other song with the lyrics &quot;I've got the radio on.&quot;  If said reviewer wants to contact me, he/she can do so at HWoodFrank@aol.com.  Good luck!
1878424319|5.0|Spiritual practice might be defined as attempting to live your true life, rather than living out of your conditioning. And this book has been an excellent supplement to my daily spiritual practice. <br />The key, in any transformative idea, is that it has to be easy to remember. That is the real value of the Four Agreements. You will remember them. And remembering them, you will put them into practice. Where I find this book to be the most useful is in conjunction with daily meditation. Rather than simply drawing your attention away from the voices of your conditioning, the Four Agreements actually shows you how to gently transform them.<br />Also, I think parents will find a little something extra here. Though not a parenting manual, the Four Agreements will speak to parents, and perhaps help lighten their load. Lastly, Ruiz' writing style is so simple and clear that you will never find yourself saying, &quot;I just don't get it.&quot;
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I bought the soundtrack only because 1 song... and it isn't in the soundtrack.  If anyone of you remember the movie you should remember the oriental &quot;chant&quot; when (bip) cut Sofi's limb at the bar.  I hate to say it but that was the best song and it is the only one missing in the soundtrack.  Then again, all the others complement for the missing song.  Is an A+ soundtrack and movie!
B00009Y3S9|5.0|It was a good movie, I was quite shocked.  I learned alot about a person I had very little knowledge of, and thought it was a great start to a better career for Hayek, she is usually in small parts and/or small films.  Hope to see more good acting from her.<br />The movie was good, had a full range of emotions; from drunken stuper to sober hatred, from passionate love to &quot;it's just a f*&quot;.<br />Highly recommended.

B0000C8AQM|4.0|The only reason I'm actually writing this review is to let my pal in Warrensburg know that his (or her) search is over...the song you're talking about is &quot;Roadrunner (Once)&quot; by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. It's an excellent song, and it's a real shame that it doesn't appear on the soundtrack. You can find it though on CBGB's and the Birth of US Punk, a nice little compilation of some early American punk songs. <br />Anyways, if you haven't seen the movie yet, do so now. It'll put a smile on any rock fan's face and a warm fuzzy feeling in his or her respective heart, and it's pretty damn funny to boot. The soundtrack was nicely done, culling many classics from past eras in celebration of the &quot;majesty of rock&quot;.
B000002H6C|5.0|For me,this is the best Metallica album, slightly better than RIDE THE LIGHTNING and MASTER OF PUPPETS. Perhaps the drums doesnt have the correct sound but, nothings perfect. Well, the album seems to have a dark line that the listener must follow to understand it, because most of the songs are quite complex. <BR> The album starts with BLACKENED, which has nice riffing and a stunning solo. Great opener to a great album.<BR> ONE is awesome, a powerfull &quot;ballad&quot; which talks about war. It has a rhythm change that drives me mad, while Kirk is soloing and Lars is breaking the gound in that incredible and trashy instrumental ending.<BR> THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY is one of the most underrated Metallica songs. At first sounds a bit jokely, but the middle sections is amazing. The solos on this album are fantastic!<BR> The sad and psydelic feel of TO LIVE IS TO DIE is followed by a more in your face metal song, DYERS EVE.<BR> The rest of the songs, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, THE SHORTEST STRAW and HARVESTER OF SORROW are truly great songs too.<BR> So, theres no excuse for no buying this album. Its a MASTERPIECE and a must for any metalhead.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Why do I give this series 5 stars?   Michael Rosenbaum.  The guy is incredible as Lex Luthor.  He's got incredible acting skills and really makes the part of Lex his own.  His scenes with John Glover, who plays his father are amazing as well as times with Tom Welling who plays Clark.  Allison Mack is another delight of the show with her snarky attitude and inquisitive nature.  Other good preformances are from Annette O'Toole and John Schneider who play Martha and Jonathon Kent.  The other cast members put in okay performances.  Tom Welling is usually shown up in scenes with Micheal Rosenbaum or Allison Mack but is still fun to watch as a young Clark Kent struggling with his new powers and identify.  Season 1 is hampered a bit by the Monster-of-week bit, but it does start the dealing with fun plots like Clark's relationship with Lex and his turmoil over Lana.  Good fun TV.

B00005JLSE|2.0|I must voice the somewhat unpopular view that this movie is completely terrible. The characters are all despicable and their behaivor is not one bit piteous. I hated all the characters and felt the movie was a waste of time, i mean, yeah, the music and costumes are interesting, but they didn't exactly come up with that stuff all by themselves...this DID come right from a Broadway musical. Richard Gere is terrible, and Ms. Zellweger is forced down our throats. Terrible movie. See Moulin Rouge instead.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|The rating should probably be three and a half stars. This movie probably served, if nothing else, to put a dent in William Shatner's reputed ego.<br />If anyone should know how to put together a Trek movie, it should be Mister Center Seat himself. Yet curiously, the humor comes from &quot;bits&quot; rather than from the character interaction where it belongs. Many of these &quot;bits&quot; only serve to undermine some of the characters. (Scotty &quot;knows the ship like the back of his hand&quot; yet he knocks himself out on a beam he'd apparently forgotten.)<br />Some of the special effects shots are laughably bad. And some of the direction is just plain questionable. (A shuttlecraft skids about a hundred feet to a stop in the bay. The master shot then shows the bay to be about 30 feet long.)<br />Fortunately, this movie was sandwiched by two far superior outings for the original crew. If you need this to complete your collection, then by all means pick it up. Otherwise, you may want to take a pass.
B00005IC2H|2.0|This lp is overrated. Orgionally rleased in Iceland in 1999 on icelandic label &quot;bad taste&quot; (what the name means in English) and released again nationally in 2001 on Fatcat records out of the U.K. Sigur Ros was put on the map by this cd. Famous musicans such as Lars Ulrich (Metallica)and Madonna saw them live and were both &quot;moved&quot; by the performance (Lars Ulrich even went as far as writting a letter to the label and the band stateing he was &quot;moved&quot;). Known for light shows and not pyro technics, sigur ros used a guitar playing method that made people admire them, but was used over 25 years earlier by Jimmy Page (led zepplin.) Playing with a bow. The kind used for stand-up string instruments like a chello or viola. The album gives a very &quot;lets do drugs and have sex&quot; kinda feel. Yet, the songs are way too drawn out and too much of the same. It sounds like beatniks are returning with more experimental ideas and intelligent garbage!  Sigur ros fans are often cought drooling over the sight of Thom Yorke (Radiohead)and arguing the definition of &quot;post rock&quot; to the death! If I were you dont get cought up in the hype of &quot;great artistic intelligent thinking&quot; or, become a stuck up loser deciding which of over twelve gsy!be side progects to ramble on about........
B000002UAX|5.0|The charges that this sprawling double album is disunified, or could have been condensed into a &quot;magnificent single&quot;, do it a great, great disservice.  The counter-question to ask, of course, is &quot;which songs would you take out?&quot;. Most people could name four or five they consider filler, and then the list stops there.  Fact is, there has always been more than three sides of<BR>classic material on The White Album, and as for the rag-tag<BR>rest (&quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;, &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, &quot;Why Don't We Do It In The Road&quot;, &quot;Can You Take Me Back&quot;), their inclusion does not harm but rather adds to the mystique of this all-powerful work.<br />By mixing so many tracks of so many different moods seemingly at random (although the lighter songs are generally grouped on side two, and the heavier songs on side three), &quot;The Beatles&quot; emerges as the ultimate pop tapestry of life itself, with all of its triumphs, tragedies, asides and bleeding ends wrapped under that famous Zen white cover.  Yes, the four members of the group were beginning to part ways, and many of the songs emerge as quasi-solo efforts (&quot;I Will&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Revolution 9&quot;).  However, many others find the band rocking harder as a unit than ever before (&quot;Helter Skelter, &quot;Everybodys...Monkey&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot;, etc.), and the oft-overlooked vocal harmonies can be majestic (&quot;Dear Prudence&quot;), bitingly acidic (&quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot;) or devilish (&quot;Helter Skelter)--in any case, the group experimented more with variations on their basic sound than on any album before or even after, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; notwithstanding.  <br />Lennon emerges once more as the lynchpin of the group, as he regains his songwriting prowess here in spades after the somewhat lean late '67/early '68 period.  Every song he contributes is a masterpiece, be it his astonishing acoustic ode tohis mother (&quot;Julia&quot;), a celebration of nature (&quot;Dear Prudence&quot;) or a tendency to parody his own depressive cycles (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;).  The slow version of &quot;Revolution&quot; does not rock like the single, but it is a fascinating, laid-back rendition which provides a new context for the words.<br />By contrast, Paul had become the master genre-slinger, cooking up ironic Beach Boys odes (&quot;Back In The USSR&quot;, which he would finally play in Russia some 35 years later), white reggae, hippie folk, metal, 20s pastiche, ballad, Wild West country and plain old rock, delivered with a real sense of both sincerity and humor that he would never regain in his solo career, even as many of the styles here would make a reappearance in his 70s works.  Harrison blossoms as a songwriter, offering up four of his finest cuts to date with the signature &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (a superior acoustic cut finding its way onto the &quot;Anthology&quot; series&quot;), the splendidly acerbic &quot;Piggies&quot; and &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; as well as the calming, neo-epic spiritual ballad &quot;Long Long Long&quot;.  Ringo chimes in with the affecting &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; (the fiddle work was always the grace of this one), as well as the closing &quot;Good Night&quot;, which caps &quot;Revolution #9&quot; brilliantly--the Disney-esque grace after the nightmarish sound collage--as well as all of what came before.  <br />Finally, what would The White Album be without all of its <BR>mystery.  From the alleged backwards clues, to the horrid Manson interpretations, to the references to their past songs (&quot;Glass Onion&quot;) and even referencing other tracks on the album (as &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; does &quot;Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da&quot;), this one displays how albums should be made on sheer inspiration, mixed with the professionalism that they had crafted since &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The second album pumped out by the already troubled young sp is the best. Some of the songs are real &quot;rockers&quot; like &quot;geek u.s.a&quot;, &quot;today&quot; and &quot;hummer&quot;, to the slow songs featuring the crackled and emotionalized voice of Billy Corgan. Songs such as &quot;soma&quot;, &quot;spaceboy&quot; and &quot;mayonnaise&quot;. This album has the rock of the early sp and not the hype of the first disc to &quot;mellon collie&quot; (featuring &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;tonight tonight&quot; and &quot;bullet with butterfly wings&quot;). A big leap since &quot;gish&quot; (1991) to the fame of &quot;today&quot; with the viedo of Billy Corgan driving a ice cream truck and James Iha in a girls dress. The songs dig deap into billy's depression (the driving force of sp lyrics). Unlike most grunge/alt bands of the 90's Sp didnt mind being successful. They sure were! Unlike bands that faded out by '95 like Nirvana (do to the death of Kurt Cobain) and the flamming lips (I see &quot;clouds taste metallic&quot; as a flop) to bigger sucess with &quot;mellon collie&quot;. Dont be fooled! &quot;mellon collie&quot; may have gone triple platinum, but lacks the emotionally challenged lyrics of &quot;simease dream&quot;. Buy this first, you wont regret it!
0385504209|5.0|The da Vinci Code is a remarkable book - I litterally could not put it down, the plot was so gripping.  The story revolves around an ancient secret society whose secret threatens the very foundations of Christianity and the Catholic church.  Suspense and mystery ensue as the &quot;da Vinci Code&quot; is attempted to be broken.<br />In the midst of its gripping story line are fascinating nuggets of trivia (&quot;the divine number&quot; for example), allusions, double-entendres, histograms, puzzles, riddles and numerous twists and turns.<br />It has been quite a while since I have read a book that I have enjoyed as thoroughly as this.  Highly recommended.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|this e.p. is a bit of a disappointment. i don't regret buying it, i enjoy listening to it, but i'd hoped for something with more intensity. some of the grooves are fun, and it's nice the freedom to stretch out, get experimental and so on. but it feels like she's resting on her laurels. there are plenty of spots where it's &quot;interesting&quot; but it never blows me away, it always feels so low key, so understated. sure, it beats all the commercial radio junk, but that was never in question. who cares if it's better than 50 cent? so is just about everything!<br />i don't care how important badu is politically, as a leader, as an example, blah blah blah, as an innovator, when it comes down to the music, it's all about &quot;what have you done for me lately?&quot; and lately, lately she's lagging a bit... the grooves are solid but badu seems barely present, just kind of floating along, lazy.<br />if you're already a fan, you'll want to get this, and it's worth having, just don't get your hopes up. if you pick it up just thinking &quot;hmm, something new&quot;, it delivers. but if you're thinking this is going to be on the level of mama's gun, you'll be disappointed...

B00003CXB4|5.0|If you have a decent Home Theater setup, the Disney &quot;Enhanced Home Theater Mix&quot; really jumps from the speakers and provides a more enveloping 5.1 mix and will give your subwoofer a workout, making those intense parts of the film even more intense (a heads up for those with sensitive young ones). The colors really pop on screen too (almost over-saturated at times). While I enjoyed these technical aspects, my 11 year really enjoyed seeing it again because she got the next level of jokes she didnt get 5 years ago.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Have heard a few grumbles about this and that flaws of TT...well, let them grumble.  I have seen this movie several times and wow...it continues the marvelous quality of the first one.  Can hardly wait for the final movie out this Winter.<br />Yes, there were some changes made from the book - but, hey, show many ANY BOOK made into a movie that does not not have changes?  None!  It's the nature of the game.  You cannot put a book - any book in it entirety on film, so stop the grumbling about how the movies is different from the book.  Judge the movie on the movie.  Period.<br />The actors continue with their high quality of acting.  The script is to fast pace I never notice how long the movie is.  There is less the gentleness of the first one, because simply they have moved passed the innocence of the shire and everyone awakening to the growing dangers.  The danger is now reached full power and Middle Earth must now battle to survive.<br />The movie is darker - as battle scenes should be - but the production value of the battle is floorings.  The extended version had over 45 more minutes of footages for those who cannot get enough.<br />Again, not for children.  This movie is even darker in tone that the first and the complexity of the story is just a bit much for children to understand and grasp the fasts violence.<br />Only, grumble I have is the Tree mutters too much!!  Poor sound editing there.

B0000C8AQM|5.0|The song you are referring to is called &quot;Roadrunner&quot; by Jonathan Richman. It appeared on the first &quot;official&quot; MODERN LOVERS album, which was indeed produced by John Cale of the Velvets. It was recently reissued as a UK import CD. It is also on the &quot;Best of Jonatahan Richman and the Modern Lovers&quot; CD on Rhino, and remains undoubtedly one of the classic rock songs of all time. (Caveat emptor: an earlier version of the song, &quot;Roadrunner #1,&quot; appears on the &quot;Original Modern Lovers&quot; CD (you do not want this one).
B0000CDL3W|5.0|I would say i would have to agree with Ron Sullivan's review stating that, the movie did change with the king of Sci-Fi action James Cameron's absense of being in front of the director's chair. But the movie was excellent. I also have to agree with Ron Sullivan's review stating that Terminator 3, was way too short. even stretching the movie to a mere 2 or 2 1/2 hours long would make the movie a hit. But you still got to respect the fact that since 1984-2003, 17 long years, that Arnold Schwarzenegger still puts on a great Terminator.<BR>( If you have not seen the movie please stop reading right here) <BR>My next comment, about the movie is that the \\"T-X\\" died way too quickly, i may be speaking for myself when i say that the T-100 was way more powerful, One explosion led to T-1000's classic re-shaping, when one explosion, led to the T-X's death. My last comment is that they should Make a Terminator 4. Everybody says that Arnold is too old now, but just think about it. In terminator 4, Arnold doesn't have to be in it, it could just be the Terminator's Exo-Skeleton, VS the humans. I mean, the first 3 movies have been about preparing for Judgement day, and keeping John Connor alive for Judgement day, don't you think they should actually make a whole movie of Judgement Day?? That's how i feel about it.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I'm really not one to buy instrumental soundtracks from movies, but I couldn't resist on this one.  As I am a 'Lord of the Rings' junkie, I have watched this movie many, many times over.  The more I watched it, the more I realized some of my favorite parts of the movie was the MUSIC!!  My very favorite is the beginning score &quot;Foundations of Stone&quot; which is the beginning of the movie and following Gandalf's fall with the Balrog.  A very close second is &quot;Evenstar&quot;, which is almost a religious experience in its beauty and awe.  &quot;Passage of the Marshes&quot; is creepy, but good.  I love the &quot;King of the Golden Hall&quot; (the scene that begins at the entrance of Edoras).  &quot;The White Rider&quot; is also almost a religious experience in its awe and power (the return of Gandalf).  I enjoy this disc very much!!

B00005QZWI|4.0|Should be 4.5/5, but there's no 1/2 option.  Great music, pretty much exactly what you hear in the movie.  If you like what you've heard, it's perfect, but listening to the whole thing start-to-finish leaves you feeling a little jolted in parts, as the mood throughout the album obviously changes pace quite a few times (from the bouncy Hobbit themes to the Nazgul, etc).  Great for use when compiling mood music albums.<br />If you liked this, you should also see about getting your hands on a CD of the music Johann de Meij composed for Lord of the Rings.  While obviously different than the music on this album, it's also great stuff.
B00008D1NF|5.0|This music is ABOLUTELY awesome! So different from what we hear in the states on the air. A friend sent me this music from Germany, and I am so thrilled with it! Most of this music (especially what is sampled) is so soft, sweet, relaxing...almost comforting. I recommend that you buy it! Miss Lola in OHIO
B00005JM4Z|3.0|although i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i must admit it wasn't as good as the 1st.maybe it was because vin diesel was absent(although it did hav paul walker!) but to me it didn't hav as much excitment and thrill in it. for ne1 that enjoys racing or cars( plus lush men!) i wud definately reccomend it though.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I LOVE this CD. You'll find so much to like in this CD. It has blues, Rock, soft-core Metal. I love it. Chris' vocals go perfectly with the grungy guitar. It's so good that I'm going to check out Sound Garden.
0345457684|5.0|Did we not learn about semicolons in school? You need one after escapades. You also need to work on your sentence structure. You are getting very close to having run on sentences in your &quot;review.&quot; Though I have not read this particular novel yet, I might consider reading it. It must not be too bad. You gave it a low &quot;review.&quot;
0440211727|5.0|After The Firm became so incredibly popular, I decided I should read it, just to know what everyone was talking about.  But since I always like to read books in the order they were written whenever possible, I decided to read A Time to Kill first, and I'm glad I did.<br />This book was just great, it had everything you could ask for.  A sympathetic figure at its center, a protagonist who was a good guy and easy to root for, and plenty of bad guys that were easy to dislike.  Add to that an action-packed plot, and the result is a book you just can't put down.<br />I've read all of Grisham's books so far, but this one still remains the best as far as I'm concerned.
0066620996|5.0|I picked up this book while stranded in an airport, and I could not put the book down. The author's approach to studying these companies is very complete, and his arguments make a lot of sense. Rather than just talking about good companies, he really goes deep into why they are successufl, and what lessons can be learned. I bet that these lessons could apply to everyone, from top managers to beginning business workers to entrepreneurs!
B000099T2L|1.0|She's got a decent voice,but it's all about image and posing and making sexy videos,but that's the extent of her talent.Her acting is like Whitney's and that's not saying much at all.
B000002AP1|5.0|Few artists have attempted the type of insane showmanship, violent assault or ferocious intensity of Iggy Pop and The Stooges, a band that remains highly influential. Groups like The Vines, The Hives, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and others are it's heirs. &quot;Raw Power&quot; along with &quot;Fun House,&quot; is the band's masterwork. The band's earlier work, which included classics such as &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; and &quot;1969&quot; were wonderfully chaotic outings, but &quot;Raw Power&quot; is focused chaos, a scorching mix of brilliant musical violence that has been remixed here with great skill. Some have complained that it is simply Iggy pumping up the distortion, but wasn't this always the case with The Stooges, were they not about pumping things up? Look at the new &quot;Search And Destroy,&quot; take the original version and you immediately notice the difference. The original sounds more tame, even muffled, here it rips and roars with a stronger base and more clear vocals. This is especially true with &quot;Gimme Danger,&quot; one of the Stooge's best cuts. Here is sounds clear, sharp and more focused and you can really appreciate Iggy's performance and the lyrics (&quot;kiss me like the ocean breeze&quot;). As an album &quot;Raw Power&quot; is still stunning, especially since compared to today's brand of distorted rock it doesn't seem to have aged at all and if released today it would still be called a masterpiece. Like his master, Jim Morrison, Iggy's lyrical and vocal attitudes here are ahead of their time as well as the sound. &quot;Penetration&quot; resounds with complete intensity and a quasi-classic feel while &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; sounds like great hard rock blues. This is the kind of in your face, bleeding (which Iggy was prone to do after famously slashing himself on stage), brand of hard rock The Stooges were so brilliant in creating. Was Iggy over the top? Sure, but his was a valid stage excess, like great theater, and it has provento be highly influential when one looks at performers like Marilyn Manson, Scott Weiland and The Hives. &quot;Raw Power&quot; is awesome, intense, even epic and deserves to be in any essential rock album collection.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Except if you are Radiohead. The greatest band in the world have amazed the world again with their brilliant work. Theif is a return to rock in some ways as they say, but if you see the band live as I have, you will see that their Kid A and Amnesiac are rock at their core as well. Theif blends together all the great things that have been Radiohead. There are sparks of The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and Amnesiac in this album. But Hail to the Theif still sounds completely original, fresh and new. In my opinion it's not only the best album of the year it's the best since 1997 (OK Computer). 2+2=5 starts the album off with a bang as the amp buzzes as Jonny plugs in his guitar an here we go the guitars swing in and out the drums smashing in our ears and Thom wailing about \\"The sky is falling in\\". Other highlights include the hypnotic The Gloaming, the banging of There, there, the crackling Myxamotosis, the straight forward beautiful Scatterbrain, and the rap like verse, jazzy, brilliant A Wolf at the Door. \\"I wish you'd get up go over turn the tape off.\\" Can't wait for album seven til then I'll rock my socks off to this great masterpeice along with the OK Computer and The Bends, all the live long day.
0553277472|4.0|After reading this novel I found myself intrigued by the way that Pirsig thinks and expresses his thoughts through the main character.  I also found it very interesting that he was able to tie together three seemingly different stories to creat a wonderful book.  The only negative thing that I have to say about this book is that it was very difficult to grasp some of the concepts that he introduced and I had to re-read some of the pages several times before I understood what he was saying.  Other than that I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read.
B00003CX8I|4.0|good comic book movie and it really is action packed, but some parts are boring and then it picks up the pace. but theres enought razzle dazzle action to go along with it and it pays off. for fans only, others who dont like this dont watch it.Hugh JAckman is great as Wolverine, but what im looking for is Gambit, he should be in this one, the sequels much better
0380789019|3.0|Neil Gaiman's Terry Pratchett-meets-Harry Potter-spiced-with-a-'dark edge'-style is appealing to some, I guess, but faeries and giants and characters that sound like Mythological rejects (which reminded me a LOT of Clive Barker's &quot;Nightbreed,&quot; incidentally) have always been near the bottom of my interest list (along with chemistry and P.E.).  &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a fairly engaging novel, but the narrative is nothing outstanding or original (normal London dweller falls in with a D&amp;D underworld populated by pixies, angels and nasty beasties).  Gaiman overuses metaphors about &quot;drops of mercury,&quot; and some passages just reek of bad Gothic poetry.  As someone who isn't a fan of this genre, I still think it's a worthwhile book--sadly, the most interesting character--the marquis de Carabas--is given only supporting-player status (he needs his own novel!).

B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'd advise anyone that is interested in The Matrix to see this movie.  Who cares if the Architect looks like Colonel Sanders?  Who cares if the rave scene in Zion was a bit unnecessary?  Who cares if the damn thing ended abruptly?  You knew there was going to be a third part.  The first one ended abruptly too...look, you can't judge the movie based on attributes that you personally don't like.  Neo needed something to separate him from everyone else and the fact that he can fly adds to that in more ways than one.  It suggests that he is not just stronger than anyone else in the matrix, but that he manipulates the matrix to make himself stronger (hence being &quot;only human&quot;).  I mean, all the parts that everyone complains about are parts that shattered everyones idea of The Matrix (the first movie).  Everyone had an idea what everything looks like and now that it didn't turn out that way, people are pissy about it.  I thought the movie was great and every expansion lead to more questions about the nature of the Wachowski brother's Matrix, NOT the everyman's Matrix (which would probably suck anyway).  See the movie and decide for yourself...not by some lame review by lame reviews that have nothing better to do (myself included).
B000060MY6|5.0|this one really works and messes with your mind a little bit. Watts delivers a grandstand performance and so does Harring. both work really well and there lesbian scenes are great too, yum, yum. Justin Theroux also does great work as well as the director guy in the movie. people may want to note that that is Billy Ray Cyrus and its cool that hes in there and it surprised me as well. and the man behind the restaurant is just plain freaky and there are some freaky moments in this flick. for Lynch fans and others
B00006LWSF|3.0|Some songs are this album are very good. Im pretty sure most people bought the album for either Lose Yourself or Wanksta. But other songs by Obie Trice aand &quot;Places To GO&quot; are all pretty good. But as the CD moves on 2 track 7 or 8, the CD really goes downfall, Songs by NAs, JAy-Z, MAcy Gray, RAkim, etc. really dont stand out as much as the first couple tracks do. The CD has great production, the 1st half of the CD is *****, but the second deserves only * or **.
B00005B36H|5.0|Personally, I believe this is Tool's best album. I believe their musical talent shines in this more melodic and meaningful album. Do not get me wrong however because with songs like &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; they keep their reputation as hard rockers alive and do so very well. The tracks that really shine on this great album are &quot;The Patient&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot;. They show Tool's ability to dare to be original and use guitar effects other than just distortion. I think all of tool's albums are great and rank as definitely the best albums in my cd collection but lateralus is by far their best effort as of yet. Believe when I say, this album is awesome.
B000007ODX|5.0|After reading the other reviews, I cant say that I will be able to provide the same kind of insight, however my experience with this cd run deep and I thought I should share.  I first discovered the Nocturnes when I was a student at berklee for jazz. I was so involved with jazz I had little time to persue classical.  A friend gave me the Nocturnes and I became obsessed.  For a month straight I went to classes with diffrent numbers from the disc stuck in my head each day, and I could hardley wait to get out of my last class and endundge with the Nocturnes.<BR>    The way Chopin writes sounds very personal and intimate to me.  I was first very imperssed with the composetions and not concerned about how the performer was interperating the songs, however it is my humble opinon that Daniel Barenboim performes the Nocturnes beautiflly.  He played them well enough to motivate me to become frequent listner to classical.   Now Chopin influences me in my own writing.  Not only have the nocturnes influenced me from a musical stand point, this music has been very nessary in the past to get me through  hard times.<BR>    I recommend this disc to anyone who is a music lover and is looking for somthing inspiring.
B00000J7A2|5.0|If you are a true fan of Rock and Rool, or good music you need to get this cd. It is the forerunner of punk. It is the beginning of alt rock. It is true blues and boogie done in an original way. It is a Beat Poet doing his stuff musically.Sadly, most people have heard only &quot;Tourt Mask Replica&quot; from the good Captain. While a great, great cd, &quot;...Replica&quot; is not easily accesible to most music fans. &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; is just that; safe as milk for the listener. Anyone can and will enjoy ths cd.Little Steven should just play this one straight through on his little Sunday Night show.All the musicians and songwriters might learn something. After you hear this one and learn to love it, a whole new world will open to you. Your mind will expand. You will see and hear new things. All without the artificial effects of drugs.You will be on the way to being a complete person with the more Beefheart you hear. Next stop; Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot!
B00008V5VN|4.0|I bought Dopesmoker on CD while already owning Jerusalem, and I thought I'd share my views.<br />I was actually a little disappointed when I first heard Jerusalem some years ago. I thought: Yikes! This is long and boring and not very heavy. Not as good as Volume 1, I thought. <br />It's a bit tricky to compare the two on CD - Dopesmoker is one long track while Jerusalem is split into six. This means that, to compare the two records by listening to the same portion, one has to hold the FF or REW down on the CD player on Dopesmoker for a good few seconds.<br />Dopesmoker is longer. It takes longer to get going, but it also repeats a section that is my favourite part of Jerusalem: in track 4 (Jerusalem) or roughly 45 min (Dopesmoker), there is a section after the quiet part where the bass really sings out BONGGG BONGGG - this is repeated in Dopesmoker to great effect, whereas Jerusalem goes straight into the \\"spliff aflame\\" lyric.<br />Artwork: Dopesmoker CD comes in an attractive card sleeve, with excellent psychedelic artwork, fore and aft, inside and out. Jerusalem is cheaper looking, but comes with lyrics, a cute bright green CD, and a great picture of a coconut bong. It's up to you.<br />Dopesmoker is louder: I found this useful on headphones: Jerusalem had to be turned all the way up on my portable player, while Dopesmoker wasn't maxxed out.<br />The second long (twangy) guitar solo seems to sound better on Dopesmoker, I think, probably because the sound is bigger generally. Also, I spotted a tiny bit of echo on the vocals somewhere in the mix, not there in Jerusalem.<br />Dopesmoker begins with a cute little flourish, while Jerusalem does not.<br />Still, comparing Dopesmoker with Jerusalem directly, on the same stereo, I was surprised to find that I actually prefer Jerusalem. Dopesmoker is definately bigger and bassier, but Jerusalem is trancier and more together. This is purely a subjective response, and I think others will definately disagree with me.<br />Also, Jerusalem is split into 6 tracks. I know the band hated it, but it's pretty sensible. I usually listen from track 2 (the way the tracks are split is intelligent and it goes into a great riff), or listen from track 4 (my favourite portion). Purists among you, don't be angry. Actually, Dopesmoker comes with extra track Sonic Titan, but I think it's a waste of time, except it allows you to jump to the end of track 1 (Dopesmoker) and rewind it if your favourite chunk is somewhere near the end. <br />52 minutes is more tolerable than 64.<br />I traded my copy of Dopesmoker, but it certainly reawakened my interest in Jerusalem. These are two very similar records anyway: I'd buy whichever one takes your fancy on a whim. You're better off with the groovy Holy Mountain or the lovely Volume 1, though!
B00007AJF9|4.0|This is an excellent film with a great cast, rightly fit for their roles. Combining fact with fantasy, Elizabeth is more entertainment than actual history due for the most part to the dramatization added to the story to keep the viewer interested. <BR>Lacking in historical accuracy mainly because of the combination of such a great array of incidents that occurred over a much longer period of time, and the main focus of Elizabeth's romance with the Earl of Leicester. But all of these features seem to be necessary to add more feeling and emotion to the plot. <BR>Regardless of the inaccuracy of the facts, the great costumes and atmosphere seem to make up for a lot, as well as the praiseworthy acting that so accurately depicts these characters.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd has alot of great songs numb, nobodys listening, faint, dont stay and figure are my favorite songs on this cd. it better than the reanimation or hybrid theory. I go on [...] every day to listen to the song NUMB.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I gave it 5 stars just for monica's ass  . . . what? the movie? . .  oh yeah the movie is great too . . . but dammnnnnnn . . . .  that is one fine ass  . . .
B00008PW2D|1.0|Not a great season although I loved this show, I can't believe they would even charge this much for a DVD with 8 episodes (maybe one disc) as they would for the three disc sets of the past seasons... they need to rethink this or wait for the release and add it to six, dont waste the money on this one.. not for that price... and I have them all, this is the first one I do mind paying for.
0064407667|4.0|i am, and have been a pretty devoted fan to the series....i've read 1-9...and was unaware that 10 had already hit book stores, but nonetheless, i think this is a great book for young children.  lemony snickett tells his stories in such a deep, strong tone, one can't help but find his style humorous.  i believe that this book is for younger children, but it is an enjoyable read to a person of any age.
B00000K19E|2.0|What's all the ballyhoo about?  Genre defining?  Maybe if the genre was SUCK.  How could 50,000 [MATRIX] fans be wrong?  For every reason in the book.  I guess you have to be hooked up to a hoover vacuum cleaner to really enjoy this useless, dead-fly-on-the-sill, dust-ball-in-the-corner, two-year-old-christmas-tinsel of a movie.  I can just hear one of the ten-thousand copies of THE MATRIX video talking to me as I pass it by in the local rental store, \\"Why do you hate me?  Why don't you just simmer down...\\"<br />First of all, Keanu Reeves is about as wooden an actor as you can get.  Even Mark Hamill had some depth playing an everyman, blank slate of an action hero who takes a similar archetypal journey.  I'm just surprised Keanu had brains enough to take the correct pill so this shinola-load of a plot could continue.  But I digress?  Larry \\"Laurence\\" Fishburne plays his part like he's recording a books-on-tape version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  I'm surprised, because he worked out so well in SCHOOL DAZE and APOCALYPSE NOW.  But I can't fault the actors really, they were handed this shlock of a script to a movie which has every yo-yo thinking they are better off somehow for having experienced this?  I guess this flick is about as challenging, mentally, as that other over-rated junkpile GLADIATOR.  Does all this cheap philosophy really get the brain tumors worked up?  Its like dropping a shiney object in a pond and watching all the fish clamor after it.  This movie was actually pretty bland and full of holes if you remove the special effects.  I found the references to ALICE IN WONDERLAND heavy-handed and cheesey.  I love ALICE IN WONDERLAND and recommend sitting down to read that book as an alternative to viewing this snooze of a movie.  I was surprised they didn't use the Jefferson Airplane song WHITE RABBIT - or at least have a techno-monstrosity version of it?  Maybe they did and I was too zoned out of boredom to notice.  <br />\\"Wow, we are really in an faux-reality controlled by the very machines we created?  Sheesh - you don't say?  Better roll out some special effects to put a hurtin' to these roving mongoloid footballs...\\"  THE ORACLE should have tried cooking up some fried eggs, because the cast was certainly wearing it on their faces.  I guess the only redeeming ounce of quality in this thing was the certifiably cool robo-villain, AGENT SMITH.  I was amazed by him - he was like a DEVO record actualized.  Stomping, in his own special Agent Smith way, on the skulls of our thinly drawn heroes.  I imagined Agent Smith wearing a huge DELETE button around his neck, erasing this movie as he went along.  Then, there were so many of him in the sequel MATRIX RELOADED - THE SEARCH FOR MORE MONEY, I felt certain at least one of the Agent Smiths would have a DELETE button stowed away in his breast pocket?  That would have been worth the eight bucks.  But now I'm obviously getting into SPACEBALLS territory.  I couldn't get this far without offering some alternative selections to cure a paying audience of this infection, now could I?  For starters: in addition to SPACEBALLS, 2001: A SPACE ODYESSEY, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, BLADERUNNER, ALIEN(S), TOTAL RECALL, STARSHIP TROOPERS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, MARS ATTACKS, 12 MONKEYS, THE THING, THEY LIVE!, TIME BANDITS, THX-1138, ENEMY MINE, PREDATOR and ROBOCOP - I offer the darkly brilliant DARK CITY.  Yes, this movie will be observed as slow and boring by the five star gushers here; but in terms of originality, vibrance, and just plain storytelling know-how -  well it leaves THE MATRIX slithering in the dust.  DARK CITY was like Alfred Hitchcock had returned from his deep carbon freeze, slipped on a pair of nice fitting SCI-FI shoes and went to bat for us one more time.<br />So, to answer the video copy of THE MATRIX sitting on the local store shelf, \\"why do you hate me so?\\"  Well, I don't hate you.  I just think you are a mindless twerp of a movie that champions every idiotic impulse imaginable in the American psyche.  This thing is about as sophisticated as a Broadway musical.  NEO is a vapid, mindless puke of a character if I ever saw one - and the casting of TED LOGAN in that role was probably the only right move the directors made?  CAPTAIN EO - sorry, I meant NEO - wants to rock and roll so badly, that it hurts.  Better call Deputy Van Halen in to save the day!  This movie deserves half a star - but I gave it two stars only because they represent the two hours of my life I will never get back.  This is the only consolation I could find... for now.  <br />Good luck boys, I'm sure the series will be a hit.
B000002TQB|5.0|Blur is one of the last true 'album' bands in existence--that is, they focus their primary energies on making brilliant and adventurous records,  la The Beatles.  Almost no band in the past decade has been so amazingly consistent, so cutting-edge and daring.  \\"Parklife,\\" their epochal 1994 release, still stands as the gold standard in the elustrious Blur back catalogue; it is a record that is boldly representive of its time period, yet light years ahead of it.  Safely said, almost no band has ever made such a pure, diverse, and enthralling pop record, one that seems to encompass the very history of rock 'n roll.  \\"Parklife\\" overflows with melody and atmosphere and Damon's lyrics unfold like a great story, jumping from one idiosyncracy of English life to the next.  His characters, pulled from the everyday pages of English life, are rich and complex figures whose lives and actions beg for the listener's full attention.  Yet, even if the listener is oblivious to the this record's staunch Englishness, the music is more than capable of enchanting your ear and enriching your mind.  Beautiful guitar riffs, sonorous and thick bass lines, spacey organs, and sweeping horns and strings permeate these tunes.  On \\"Girls and Boys,\\" the catchiest bass line in the history of recorded music is intertwined with a minimalist guitar figure and a bleepy synth to make one of the best pop singles in history.  On \\"This Is A Low,\\" a backwards guitar figure cascades over light cymbal splashes, eventually giving way to Damon's echoey, melancholy chorus--when he longingly enunciates \\"This is a low/But it won't hurt you when you're alone,\\" the hairs on my neck stand up.  The instrumental track \\"The Debt Collector\\" is whimsical and memorable, \\"Bank Holiday\\" is a thick, tasty slab of mod punk, a journey to garage rock heaven that remains far beyond the reach of many latter-day bands, and \\"Far Out\\" is a mysterius space-rock mini-suite, as bassist Alex James takes the mic with his melodramatic voice.  Clearly, a slightly avant-garde/psychedelic aura edges this album, adding to the thick, superbly arranged pop melodies the genius of Coxon's angular guitar work (the solos on \\"This Is A Low,\\" \\"London Loves,\\" \\"Bank Holiday,\\" \\"Jubilee,\\" and \\"Tracy Jacks\\" are all quite impressive, proof that one doesn't have to reel off raging blues motifs to be a guitar virtuoso) and Damon's restless experimentalism.  Each tune brings something different and enchanting to the table, whether it's  the chiming harmonics of \\"Badhead\\" or the lush accordion and strings orchestration of \\"To The End.\\"  \\"Parklife\\" is loaded with surprises and left turns, and its artistic diversity keeps things interesting throughout.  Blur have finished what The Kinks started, and in the process have made the best British album since \\"The La's\\" or maybe even \\"The Queen is Dead.\\"  A must have.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is a slick, competent thriller. It's a blend of the story-driven crime capers of a generation ago and today's computer generated special effects techniques. For the most part, this combination succeeds. The action and the story are both strictly of the \\"only in the movies\\" variety, but they are fun to watch. \\"The Italian Job\\" may not be a classic, but it is quite entertaining. <br />The movie opens in Venice, where John [Donald Sutherland], an old professional thief, and his protegee, Charlie [Mark Wahlberg], are in the final stages of planning a $35,000,000 gold heist with their gang. The exciting, though improbable, plan goes off without a hitch, but one of the members, Steve [Edward Norton], turns out to be a traitor. He and his own Ukrainian gang steal the gold and leave John, Charlie and the rest for dead in an Alpine lake. Steve ends up in Los Angeles, where he uses his gold to finance a lavish lifestyle.  What he doesn't know is that everyone but John survived somehow, and now, along with John's beautiful daughter, Stella [Charlize Theron], the guys are out for revenge. <br />The excellent cast, which also includes Seth Green and Jason Stratham, doesn't have much in the movie that tests its muscles talent-wise, but everyone performs with great gusto. They may be in `just a movie', but at least it is far from an embarrassing one. <br />Of particular note is the photography. It may be hard to make Venice and the Italian Alps looks bad, but this movie even manages to make Los Angeles look inviting.
B000002BBY|2.0|It is so hilarious to say that Oasis '...sounds like The Beatles,' since absolutely no one sounds like The Beatles.  Many have tried to do so, but virtually none have succeeded; the Fab Four's impeccable commingling of talent is far beyond the reach of mediocre tribute bands such as Oasis.  I can hear faints diluted traces of Lennon's voice in Liam Gallagher's nasal whine, and every now and then a Beatles-ism will seep through the mix (judging by the guitar playing, it looks as if Noel Gallagher listened to &quot;Revolution&quot; nonstop for years), but otherwise this is a poor imitation more appopriate in a pub that in the annals of rock and roll.  Most of this album is filler, 4/4, straight-ahead guitar rock with nary an original idea or riff (&quot;Morning Glory&quot; swipes its riff from REM's &quot;The One I Love&quot; and makes a pointless allusion to the immortal &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;).  &quot;Wonderwall&quot; is okay, as is &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger,&quot; but the rest is borderline intolerable.  I've heard people compare this to &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; which is complete nonsense; the simplistic, one-trick pony songwriting here is a far cry from the ground-breaking experimentalism and pop genius of those two masterworks.  The Gallaghers don't have The Beatles' versatility, inventiveness, or....why am I even saying this?  No one can be The Beatles, especially not these pretenders.  They're not The Beatles, they're not even The La's or The Stone Roses, two latter-day British bands who truly captured the essence of 60s rock.  Gallagher's songwriting chops have nothing on those of Lennon and McCartney, Squire and Brown, or Lee Mavers .  Oasis are, at best, a decent tribute band, as this safe, watered-down collection of trite riffing and overwrought balladery proves.
0486411818|5.0|I consider this book simply excellent. The book does contain all the information you need to understand the finite element method. It comes with a companion software you can download. I don't actually understand those people who complain about the &quot;excess&quot; of math: com'on. If you don't like math, why in the world are you trying to do FE analysis? If you need to know, say, what is hourglassing, you need to know the theory behind the integration over a master element, otherwise you will never understand what hourglassing is. This is a bare example of what you need to know in order to do some FEA. If this is the kind of information (plus a much more) you're looking for, this is the book for you. Even though, as many other FE books, it's full of math, I've found it less &quot;cryptic&quot; than Bathe's book.<BR>Enjoy it!
B000002KIE|5.0|Just because it's old doesn't mean it's outdated. This is a perfect CD for true punks who stay true to their roots. The controversial lyrics, simple but scathing guitar sounds, and Johnny Rotten's blisteringly beautiful voice make this a great CD. The release date may be in '77, but the sounds still stay with more recent punk. Remember your roots! Without the Sex Pistols, punk would never have gotten its foothold in the music industry. They paved the way for every punk band after them, from The Ramones and The Clash to Rancid, NOFX, The Misfits, The Casualties, and Black Flag. This CD is the best Brit punk CD you can buy.
B00007LTIA|4.0|For the true Yes fan, this is almost a religious experience.  It's lengthy, over-the-top and self-indulgent at times but still an enthralling journey from beginning to end.  It goes from strange and noisy to beautiful and serene, then back again.  I once spent a day riding through the Rocky Mountains with another Yes fanatic back in the 70s and we both had to keep our seat belts on to keep from ascending into heaven!  If Yes is not your cup of tea, then stay away.  Evidently they felt free enough at this point in their career to drop all pretense of delivering a top 40 hit and just went with their urge to create 4 side-long epics without restraint.  Jon delivers his earthy sermons, Chris and Alan mesmerize with their rythms, Rick holds up the musical background like a scenery technician and, as always, Steve Howe's guitar work is simply amazing.  For the Yes fan, this is an ocean of joy.
B00003CXA3|5.0|William Friedkin is really underrated in terms of direction. This movie, The French Connection, has a great documentary feel to it, and is very realistic. Gene Hackman's performance as Popeye Doyle was one of the best roles I've seen in an action movie. Roy Scheider was awesome too. Favorite line from him: Shove it up your a$$. The movie has the best car chase ever, even if most of it was an accident. Friedkin said that there were supposed to be no crashes in that chase. Just near-misses. I think the crashes help the movie. The French Connection is just a great action movie. I loved it.
B00008US8R|5.0|evanescence has a very unique sound...kinda like Enya meets Finger Eleven maybe?? well that was a bad example.  evanescence is NOT linkin park.  not even close.  i dont see y ppl keep saying that!!  and Darth Skellington, sorry to burst your bubble, but that isn't the tracklist for &quot;origin&quot; i have it. and there is only 9 songs on it...and there's no song called &quot;origin&quot; that came out... and there's a HUGE difference in the versions of the songs!! how can u not see that?? on &quot;origin&quot;, the song &quot;Imaginary&quot; has piano at the beginning, and is played WAY diffrently than on fallen! and &quot;my immortal&quot; has only the piano, where as on &quot;fallen&quot; it is also accomponied by a violin...and &quot;whisper&quot;  sounds like its live on &quot;origin&quot;  if u cant notices the differences in the songs, im assuming u don't have the ACTUAL cd...that u probably downloaded it, because the differences are VERY noticable, and u have the wrong tracklist! sorry...but i thought u'd want to know the truth.<br />but for u ppl who liked Fallen, i suggest u try downloading their songs!! they have like over 40 songs out there that didnt make this album! (and i have no idea why, because each and every song is good!) i think they shoulda put them ALL on this album!!  the unreleased songs have a bit of a difference to these songs, they're a bit more slower...like My Immortal. but there's some AWESOME enya-like songs they do!  check out &quot;Listen to the Rain&quot; and &quot;Anywhere&quot; those are only two of the songs! also get &quot;Breathe No More&quot; it HAS to be their best song!! well c ya'll l8er!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|No originality stems from the rockin sounds of Jet, not that much of todays music doesn't have huge influences of the past but hardly are they as evident as what is heard from Get Born. Rip offs of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Kinks, and even The Supremes can be heard throughout the cd with similar riffs from Led Zepplin and other classic rock seeping into your ears. Even one of the songs is called rollover D.J.( as in rollover beethoven). Don't get me wrong, they are all new songs with totally different lyrics, just with tons of old references from the past. Conclusion:great cd, just give credit where it is due.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' COME AWAY WITH ME garnered a great number of Grammy awards for good reason: it's flat-out good music.  Her soft, silky but strong voice carries this low-key album across musical genres in rare form.  It's groovy enough to be jazz.  It's catchy enough to be pop.  It's accessable enough to enjoyed by almost everyone.<br />Reminicent of music heard in many a fine piano/jazz establishment, this is not the kind of album that warrants intense, purposeful listening.  It's humble, mininalist mentality and spartan sound are its beauty, making it perfect for grabbing a warm cup of coffee, a good book (or a friend), and enjoying a quiet evening together.<br />She's surrounded herself by great musicians and producers, so judging by her debut, we'll be able to expect great things from Ms. Jones as she, like fine wine, improves with age.  COME AWAY WITH ME comes highly recommended to those seeking a pitch-perfect album with which to unwind.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Klaus Badelt's rousing, rollicking score to the equally rousing, rollicking Disney film \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" is unabashed fun.  Music critics are nit-picking it as unoriginal or uninspired -- Frankly, I'm having too much fun listening to it to care.<br />The prominent and much-repeated main theme belongs to Captain Jack Sparrow and just about any time he's on screen doing anything even remotely active.  An active triplet-rhythm brassy theme accompanies his arrival on a sinking rowboat, as well as his swordfight with Will Turner, the sailboat chase, and the final duel in the cave through shafts of moonlight.<br />A second theme accompanies the ghostly crew, first appearing in track 5, as Elizabeth Swann stumbles onto the deck of the Black Pearl to see skeletons swabbing the deck and adjusting the sails.<br />A third theme is a bouncy little cello/harpsichord duet, usually used when characters are engaged in something crafty such as walking along the bottom of the bay using an upside-down rowboat as an aqualung.<br />I will concede with the critics that its overall effect does not come across as a multi-themed evening at the symphony, but the themes it does display are just so gripping I can't complain.<br />My one issue is with the track listings.  The first few track titles on the CD do not match with the scenes in the movie in which the tracks come from.  As the music is, nonetheless, still exciting, and still comes from the movie, it's a small point.<br />Music critics, shop somewhere else.  Fun-loving casual listeners ready to be lifted right out of your sofas, buy it now!
B000002UB3|3.0|&quot;Octopuses Garden is great.  It's a nice and happy song.&quot;  Give us all a break.<br />Led Zeppelin was releasing ground breaking music at the time this was done.  The Beatles had really fallen somewhat behind.  I'm counting on the new release of &quot;Let It Be&quot; to be a return to the great music that the band had to offer.<br />Abbey Road has some redeeming qualities, but Octopuses Garden detracts rather than adds to this album.
0783231032|3.0|I would need to compare this new Director's cut DVD with the originally released version, but it seems as if the fat has been reapplied to a lean steak.  I found my attention wandering often, and imagined I saw the seams where unnecessary elements were reinstated, to the viewer's detriment.<br />Having said that, the film is still enjoyable, and the humor often works well when it appears.  Large scale production and well-filmed miniatures combine for a spectacular visual feast.  A fun film to watch with a group, so you can chat up the slow parts and magnify your laughter when the slapstick hits the fan.
B00005R24K|5.0|This was a great movie. Even though it had no plot at all it was a movie made just for fun, though they could have made it longer. It is a must see.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Actually, this almost created a new genre; the sci-fi/horror/action-adventure that was later copied, in my eyes, by Paul Verhoven in Starship Troopers. That wasn't quite as scary, but it still had the elements to make it a sci-fi, the elements to make it a horror film, and of course, the elements to make it an action-adventure film. Need I say more?<br />Aliens started that kind of picture and nothing has yet come close to even equaling the masterful direction and writing (by James Cameron), the masterful acting (lets go down the list and commend Academy Award Nominee, Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, portraying the child who Ripley takes in as a daughter and tries to protect throughout most of the film, even, Paul Reiser for playing the most sleazy and back-stabbing man in space, Michael Biehn for being the very reserved hero, and even, Bill Paxton as the funny, sometimes annoying character, Hudson), and lets not forget the masters behind all the technical wizardry. Stan Winston and his wonderful puppets and makeup, and Alien suits comes to mind.<br />You have to see this movie to understand how great, how intense and how new a film it really is.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem is by far the best singer to have come from Australia. Her powerful ballads and encanting piano melodies are mesmerizing. And she not only has the voice of an angel, but she plays the piano, has a sunny, positive personality and always has time for her fans.<BR>   Earlier this year, Delta was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, a treatable form of cancer, just weeks before she was due to go to New York to promote her stunning debut album. <BR>   Here in Australia, we know that her unfailingly positive attitude to life and her loyal fanbase will help her get through this cancer, and she will be back and better than ever in 2004.<BR>   Please, support this amazing young woman by buying this album. How beautiful and moving her music is can't be put into words. And how much Delta deserves to keep making her music when her treatment is finished can't be put into words either.
B00003OSSL|4.0|I like this movie. I don't care much about what the critics said about it, nor about its failure to top box office records. I found this movie a psychologically intense drama, and I think acting was very good. Ford portrayed a clearly distraught and somewhat depressed and distracted man who lost his wife in plane crush, and who find out that his wife was cheating on him. He comes in contact with another &quot;survivor,&quot; a Congresswoman who lost her husband in the same plane crush. A somewhat unlikely romance develops, while Ford's character continues to be haunted by his wife's betrayal. The subplot, involving a corrupt cop and murder, could be improved--it almost gets in the way of the main storyline. But if you can get beyond this, you will enjoy the movie.<br />If you are into non-stop action, special effects pictures, this one is not for you. But if you can enjoy a mature film with a real plot, you will do well to see &quot;Random Hearts.&quot;
B000025XKM|5.0|'Pink Moon' is an all-time classic music masterpiece.  There have only been 3 all-time great releases which have consumed me via their sheer beauty and ability to transport me and my emotions away to a faraway place filled with peace and tranquility.  'Pink Moon' is one of them (the others being 'Me Died Blue' by Steven Delopoulos, and 'After Everything Now This' by The Church).  Drake's emotional and heartfelt songs evoke a myriad of genuine feelings for him and his music that are rare in today's generally hyped and commercialized music.  The fact that one voice and one acoustic guitar alone can accomplish this attests to the genius of the man.  Kudos must also go to the engineers who were able to do a killer job of properly digitally remastering this gem!  The enhanced timbre, resolution, and 'air' around Nick's vocals and guitar tone is evident, especially on a really good high-end system.  I just picked up a pair of 'Magneplanar' audiophile panel speakers, and christened them by playing 'Pink Moon', and I think I died and went to heaven! I have achieved 'eargasm'!
1559408855|2.0|Pasolini's last film is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. It's also one of the most uncomfortable. Based loosely on the Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom the film transports that work to fascist Italy in the ending days of WWII.<br />A group of powerful men kidnap a large group of young innocents and essentially turn them into their personal slaves. The point of all this seems to be that power has the ability to currupt totally.<br />The images on the screen are some of the most depraved that have been committed to film. Pasolini is more indebted in my mind to Dante than to deSade. The film is presented in \\"Circles\\" much like Dante's Inferno.<br />This is not a film that you will want to see over and over. It is not a film in any way erotic. It is a film that will make you think and evaluate man's place in society.<br />Is it worth the price of the DVD? More than likely not, but Criterion has found this to be one of the most important films of the 20th Century. Watcher beware and \\" Abandon all hopes ye who enter here.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's an interesting testomony to ratings vs quality. The people who decided this show was not worthy of continuing should take a look at the ratings here and not the ratings of what they consider the 'typical' viewing public.  I'm begining to think this 'typical' viewing public is not much more than a group of couch potatoes.<br />Network executives seem to only want to cater to those who have to live vicarious through 'Reality' shows.  I suppose the next logical step for these executives is a live 'Running Man'.<br />I cannot really add to other's reviews of this great short lived show.  They already touch on all the excellent points of quality that this show provided.  I am anxiously waiting for the movie.
B00003CXB4|5.0|With a Touch of Hamlet and a sprinkle of King Lear, The Lion Kings is a real achievement in every aspect.  A tale about coming of age and the right of destiny that has a real timeless effect on all age groups.  Not only is this movie such a monumental film in animation but is an achievement in motion picture scoring as well. Elton John and Tim Rice not only bring a great soundtrack to this epic but accompanies it with a sense of style that has not be duplicated ever since its release.<br />A real Disney classic in every sense of the word, and a real keeper for generations to come.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle's new album, Thirteenth Step, follows up well to the previous Mer de Noms.  This time though, they have brought a clearer, more mellow, more complete sound.  This album reflects A Perfect Circle's dark roots and tackles issues held deep within.  The lyrics are that only of lead singer Maynard and the music establishes a new sound for rock.  The album clearly shows rock evolution at it's finest and can be described as nothing short of a masterpiece. 5 Stars
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is the most hillarious movie I have ever seen!!!! If you like to laugh, you should buy this movie. Plus, it's a musical, and the songs are hysterical! &quot;Blame Canada&quot;, &quot;It's Easy M'Kay&quot; and Cartman's &quot;Kyle's Mom's a B**ch&quot; are the best! I would give it 6 stars if I could. You don't have to be a South Park fan to love this movie, it's just so funny!
6305128952|3.0|His name is Monty Roberts.  The non-fiction book available on Amazon is &quot;The Man Who Listens To Horses&quot;.  He first started talking to horses in 1947 after watching wild Mustang communicate in the Nevada desert.  Get it, read it...you will not be disappointed.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Not as good as there last studio album Silver Side Up, but still good music. Someday is the standout track and Nickelback proves that they are not a one-album wonder. Good work by the Canadians.
0767849493|3.0|The only reason I watched this film was for Ben Affleck, I've wanted to see it for ages, but never got the chance to, or gone out of my way to buy it on DVD. But I did enjoy it, even if it was a bit weird. I definitely want it on DVD now, to shed some more light on the (many) bits that I did not understand!<br />I'm not a fan of Matt Damon (Loki), he generally annoys the hell out of me, so that was one bit of the film I didn't like. Ben Affleck (Bartleby) was cute though - especially when he was angry! They play the good angel/bad angel, constantly switching back and forth.<br />There are a few familiar faces in this, apart from the obvious - George Carlin (Bill & Ted - rock on dudes!), the chain-smoking girl from Romy & Michele's High School Reunion, Jay & Silent Bob, Chris Rock (Rufus), Salma Hayek (Serendipity) and Alan Rickman. The latter was definitely brilliant, so sarcastic! Jay & Silent Bob just have to be in every Kevin Smith film, and they totally remind me of the guys from Wayne's World (watch out for the bits in the car). I wasn't keen on them, although Silent Bob plays a great part, and manages to make up for what he doesn't say, with facial expressions etc. He was so funny!<br />There are two classic lines in this film. Ben's \\"Do I come across as gay?\\" and Alan Rickman's \\"If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing about.\\" So true!<br />I thought this was along the lines of The Prophecy, although better! Also, watch out for the toilet scene - similar to the one in Trainspotting, but much, much worse!<br />Being a film mainly about religion, there's quite a lot to take in, but it is easy to follow. The story also makes you think, especially what Rufus says about Mary & Joseph. A lot of the stuff went straight over my head, due to not being in any way religious myself, but I know the basics. The Apostles etc, didn't make any sense to me, but maybe would to others, who know all this stuff. I did enjoy this film, and would highly recommend it to anyone. I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for the DVD, with plenty of extras, which explain the film more in-depth, and a commentary.<br />Oh, and the end credits are great, although they were severely truncated by watching it on TV. And God is a woman? Something we women have known for a long time!t to anyone.

1565123875|5.0|Purple Hibiscus is a must read for anyone who is interested in family dynamics, the nature of faith and freedom, or modern-day Nigeria.  An excellent debut.
0618345841|5.0|A worthy copy of Tolkien's epic magnum opus.  Peter Jackson's movies are near excellent (although they do change the storyline of the book, usually quite dramatically), but they still pale in comparison to the original written words (of course).  <br />If you plan on buying the complete works in a one-edition copy, this is it.
0312319517|3.0|Even after all these years, I remember the thrills that Frederick Forsyth generated in my adolescent heart with his early works, such as 'Day of the Jackal' 'The Odessa File' and 'Dogs of War'. Not only were they well crafted novels of international intrigue with subtly communicated opinions on the machinations of the international military/industrial complex, they always contained a neat twist, with an often overlooked clue dropped almost offhanded early in the story which later is discovered to be critical to the plot's resolution. So I looked forward to this latest offering. Sadly, I was left unsatisfied; but more because of what I think is sloppy editing than the author's lack of skill. <BR>    Cal Dexter (not 'Pete' as one well known and prolific reviewer has mistakenly written all over the net) is the kind of modern hero that we all can respect. The child of a broken marriage and a nomadic childhood with a blue collar father, he volunteers for the Army during the Viet Nam era, serving with distinction as a 'tunnel rat', one of an elite corps who braves the subterranean maze beneath the battlefields to find and eliminate Viet Cong fighters. He bonds with a better educated superior officer and through this relationship finds the drive to leave the service and work his way through law school. Although offered a lucrative position with a well established firm, he chooses instead to become a public defender, championing the rights of the unfortunate.<BR>     From this point on, I am going to have to be a bit cryptic, since as any reader of Forsyth's work knows, enjoyment of his books depends on a reviewer being very discreet about how the plot twists, in order to avoid spoiling the surprise ending. In the case of 'Avenger', this is again essential. Suffice it to say that a series of personal tragedies compels Dexter to lead a double life. He leaves public service and sets up a low key private practice in a suburban town near New York City, but in secret becomes 'Avenger', a skilled bounty hunter dedicated to bringing killers and the like to face justice.     It is as Avenger that he is contacted by a billionaire whose only grandson has been brutally murdered while serving as a relief worker in Yugoslavia. Unbeknownst to him, the murderer is protected by high level US government agents, who are planning to use this evil man to reach an even more important target, and are ready to sacrifice the life of our hero to achieve what they believe is a greater good. <BR>    The plot is resolved with typical Forsyth cunning, and with a typical Forsyth 'twist' at the end. The problems with 'Avenger', that keep it from being one of Forsyth's better work, mostly concern sloppy editing. For example, at one point, a character converses with a Yugoslav in what the author specifically states is in English; but a few pages later, the same character is specifically described as not understanding English. This is the most obvious of the flaws; there are many others, as well as inexplicable style conventions, such as the use of 'f***' instead of the printing of the word. And according to some who know the areas of the world in which the novel is set, there are many errors when it comes to the geography.<BR>     All in all, 'Avenger' is still above the crowd, as any Forsyth book would be expected to be. But the annoyances do take away from the enjoyment, and the 'twist' is not up to Forsyth's best. Those less critical will still have a good read, but for those of us who have looked forward to the return of Frederick Forsyth, it can only be wished that he had had an editor who was more dilligent.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Well, what can i say about this album? It's one of those brilliant alternative albums you can just listen your way through. THome York at his level best and the experimented music is just incredible with all the digitized effects. Blows me away.
B000099T2L|4.0|This CD, unfortunately has a lot of slow songs, something i didn't expect from beyonce. Although the tracks do express how powerful her voice really is, I was hoping for more Upbeat tracks, like &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy.&quot; Baby Boy being one of the best tracks on the CD. I do find the song &quot;Signs&quot; featuring Missy Elliot, kind of strange, and pointless to say it's featuring Missy Elliot, because you hear nothing but two lines come out of Missy, no flow, no rhyme. The Best songs on the album are &quot;Thats how you Like it&quot; featuring Jay Z, this track is really good. And &quot;Dangerously Inlove 2&quot; which is the best ballad on the CD. All together, the cd is a good listen.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|If you are a genuine lover of music, whether it be classical, dance, rock, or whatever - you will undoubtedly be impressed by the talent which has produced this excellent piece of work. Track four - 'Ageispolis' is one of my all time favourite tracks - it is just so unusual and enchanting. This particular track is ambient, but has a sound through it which makes the whole room vibrate while still being relaxing!!?? Very cleverly done. If you have other Aphex Twin albums, but find them a bit 'mad' or even scary, then don't worry because this one is different and is very calm and unobtrusive. I used to put my stereo on quiet and go to sleep with this playing some nights. It is one of the few albums I have considered getting a second copy of just incase this one gets damaged. One last note - if you read the other reviews, you will see that the artist has a strong international fan base and, although the music is a million miles from being 'mainstream', many, many people have been affected in a positive way by this thought inspiring musical genius and have realised that it is truly something special.
B00005Q45W|1.0|Sometimes an artist produces one work too many.  The one that shows he is not only past his prime, but has actually gone to seed.  With Ten New Songs, the listener witnesses a great talent going into eclipse.<br />This is not that grizzled troubadour of the bizarre, who filled acid-soaked brains with images like &quot;then you killed the lights in a lonely lane, and an ape with angel glands, erased the final wisps of pain with the music of rubber bands.&quot;  It is not that one who immortalized Suzanne, and reminded us that Jesus was a sailor, etc.  From the deck of Leonard's ship, you could see Salvador Dali, feverishly painting a surreal other shore.<br />No such fervid imaginations illuminate Ten New Songs, but the title is still descriptive, for Cohen has certainly come up with a \\"new\\" way of singing without having a song in his heart.  But soon he will be quiet forever, or so he keeps reminding us.  Whence came this strange malaise?  Cohen has spent the last five years, they say, in a Zen monastery.  This would seem to be borne out by the bizarre tilt of his thoughts, such as &quot;I don't trust my inner feelings -- inner feelings come and go.&quot;  This may be proper Buddhist dogma, but it isn't the stuff of good music.  This is a New Song indeed -- one that ventures indifference as a musical theme.  I have to agree with the guy above who said it was actually the worst CD he ever heard.  It would be hard to disagree.<br />I only listened to six and half of the Ten New Songs, but even this brief encounter had a depressing effect similar to a long chat with a suicidal friend. If it weren't for the depressing effect, however, the CD would be useful for lowering blood pressure.  The pacing of these compositions is elephantine.  To call them sedate overstates their stimulating effect.  Torpid would be more like it.  In one tuneless tune, Cohen dwells obsessively on the image of &quot;dark rivers.&quot;  I felt like I'd won a free vacation to buy time share in the underworld, and Cohen was the salesman.  He was very convincing.  I felt dead already.<br />Zen meditation seems to have lowered the temperature of Leonard's mind.  In one New Song he says he's turned to ice within, and finds it \\"crowded and cold\\" inside himself.  One is tempted to caution him to be wary of falling into the same fate as the senescent Ram Dass, who meditated himself into a stroke by visualizing himself as an old man with failing extremities and vision.  His adventure of the imagination precipitated exactly what he contemplated, and he now is rolled about by his spiritual nabobs in a wheelchair he calls his \\"swan boat.\\"  If the lethargic rhythms of the New Songs are any indication, Leonard may be drifting a little close to the big drain that goes straight down.  The pulse of this music is so faint as to be nearly comatose, tending toward flatline.  From his present vantage point, Leonard Cohen sees no light, or if he does, he brings no report of it.  He has one direction resolved, as well -- deeper into the shadowland.  He says he knows he's forgiven, but doesn't know exactly how.  I was left wondering when he'd been found guilty, and if his sentence was perhaps too severe.  Leonard seems to be seeking closure and resolution, coming to terms, preparing for the end.  But from the results displayed in these New Songs, I suspect he would have been better off keeping his accounts open, getting and spending the rich treasury of the imagination.  In this album he seems hypnotized by the anticipated darkness of death.  Tragically, his song has preceded him to the grave.underworld, and Cohen was the salesman.  He was very convincing.

B000070WJE|5.0|This is my absolute CD ever. What more can I say.... If you have liked Robbie's previous work, you'll love this one :)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle delivers the good, as expected, once again. While there style of music may not cater to those who are programmed to generic Rock music, it truly stands out by taking Rock to a higher level. Best alt. Rock album, period.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badu, is one of the most unique artists in the game! This album just solitifies that!. Although, I did expect there to be more tracks, it's still worth it. Her beats are good, and her lyrics are bangin! I can't say this album compares to her debut &quot;Baduizm&quot; but is still good in its own right. &quot;Love of My Life Worldwide&quot; is the best track on this album. Ring ding dong, ring a ding ding ding dong!...It's off the hook, and gets you pumped. Erykah is a one of a kind artist, and that's why we love her! Worth it album, go get it!
B000002UB6|3.0|Well, here I am again. I think you all my friends are good recipients of the news about the fab four. I have heard about the reissue of the album &quot;let it be&quot; on November. And I think that the dismiss of two songs will affect the unity of the album. After all people of my generation knows it very well, but, what about the new overtime customers of rock? &quot;Dig it&quot; is an eventual incursion of a kid in the track and the text sung by John Lennon makes me laugh when I first heard it (like a rolling stone...) And &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; seems to me is about a villain of the far west or so. Let me tell you one thing. I'll step out to nuy this CD before it'll become a museum thing.
B00006GA48|5.0|I too had the original CD, which was cheaply made and didn't sound very good.  I didn't listen to that cd enough to 'get' it.<br />When I got the remaster, I couldn't believe what a GREAT album this is!  The sound is unbelievable.  And the songs are ultimate Grand Funk Railroad.  <BR>You've got to listen to these songs all the way through.  Every one of them gets better and better throughout each song.  This was the BEST from this awesome band.  And again, the remaster just SOUNDS so great.  If you want ONE defining Grand Funk Album, this should be it.  After this, I'd go E Pluribus.
B000002HAF|5.0|if you buy one album this month, year, or liftetime, make it surfer rosa. the pixies are my all-time favorite band, and this is their most deranged and craziest CD. &quot;Gigantic&quot; is a highlight track, a creepy little tune about a girl who watches a guy and his girlfriend mess around outside. you won't pick up on the story unless you actually read the lyrics.<br />well, i'm already bored with writing this. i suppose all i can say is you won't be disappointed. this is money well spent, my friend.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I admit, I'm a relitively new Rocky Horrorette. However, since my best friend introduced me to Frankie, Rocky, Riff and Magenta on my 17th birthday, we've been inseperable.<br />This DVD found it's way into my collection when I was away from home for work, didn't have a VCR (so my VHS was worthless!) and needed a fix. I paid $60 Australian for it in the end, to be posted to the middle of nowhere (otherwise known as Roxby Downs, SA) and it was worth every cent! The extra features may not be completely flashy, but when you're stuck in a remote mining town for 6 weeks with no one but you who likes Rocky Horror, the Audience Participation on the disc can become your best friend! And it did. Unfortunatly, I don't think my neighbour agreed!<br />Buy this DVD, if only so that it's there one day for your children to become addicted to!
B000002A46|5.0|In a survey, they asked what is your favorite ORIGINAL christmas song, &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; was number 2, with &quot;12 days of christmas&quot; being number 1, and MARIAH WROTE, COMPOSED, PRODUCED, the song, it is all original! One of the best, feel good Christmas songs you will ever hear. This Christmas album, will really get you in the spirit, &quot;Santa Clause Is Coming To Town&quot; was wonderfully remade, as well as &quot;Joy To The World.&quot; Other original tracks like &quot;Miss You Most At Christmas Time,&quot; really expresses &quot;holiday lonliness,&quot; which many people can relate to. All in all, this is one of the best, if not the best, Christmas Album you'll ever buy, hear, or recieve! I catch myself, listening to it in July, and you probably will too!

0792841344|2.0|Do people really like this movie?  There is not one single scare in the entire thing, the plot makes little to no sense (especially the ending, in which a character previously declared dead shows up, alive and well, with no explanation of any kind), and the kid brother is abandoned by his big brother so many times and against all reason that I felt I might go mad if I had to suffer one more such scene.  I kind of feel the same way about all these five-star reviews people are posting here.  Come on, people; develop some taste.
B00007GZVS|3.0|In general the movie was very enjoyable,  it is very interesting and extremely entertaining. However the movie is very historically inaccurate, but had it been made fully accurate it would not have been nearly as entertaining and a lot longer. Although the actual plot might not be fully true, the movie helps show many other aspects of the time period, such as language, costume, and architecture, it does this very well which helps make it a bit more accurate.
B00003W8NM|5.0|There are moments when Fight Club loses its pace; when moments drag.  Put aside this one flaw, and put it aside you must, and you're left with a piercingly intelligent deconstruction of modern life.  It is a movie perched on an overhang, with just enough height and distance to give a snarling, infuriariting perspective on a society that has turned us into docile husks.  Ever feel that sinking emptiness inside, the hollow, clawing demise of your soul?  Ever wish the plane you were on would crash, putting you and a couple of other hundred meaningless lives to rest?  Fight Club tells us why it is so important to live, and what it means to take control of your life and scream to the heavens that you matter.  Even if you don't.<br />That's where Fight Club begins for it's lead character; a man trapped, looking for a way out, knowing that he can't escape it alone.  He needs a hero; a savant; an angel.  And into his life walks Tyler Durden, a roaming, phantasmagorical Christ figure, ready to grab him by the neck and beat him into consciousness.  I don't want to tell you more, but rest assured that the dialogue is crisp, insightful, and wonderfully real.  The story is crystalline, full of metaphor, nuance, and irony.  It is also breathtakingly violent, showing us how much we all need the equivalent of a sharp, short, shock to the face, to spit a few teeth into the sink, to feel the sting of lye burning through skin, through sinew, into bone.  Pain may be the most real thing we have.  It's the only thing that may make us listen--to ourselves and others.<br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt shine, but so do the rest of the actors.  The cinematography is lush at times; macroscopic at times; flamingly good.  The directing is a wonder.<br />Films rarely are this good; stories are rarely so timely.  And as you watch the final moments unfold, they may put current events in a very different perspective.  Thank god this movie was made; it would not have been made later--as you will learn.<br />Watch it.n.<br />Watch it.
B000089RVX|1.0|I'm just way too generous. Actually, it's because I can't. One star is the lowest I can give so consider it a 0. Evanescence is a major example of the new generation of music. They're completely untalented, overrated, and I strongly believe Amy Lee or whatever her name is should go and pursue her great dream of becoming an opera singer. That really wasn't her great dream but I think she should anyway. Why is it, you ask, that Evanescence is the most popular &quot;band&quot; out there(they're not even a band, Evanescence IS Amy Lee or whatever her name is)? Because mainstream music listeners have no taste in music. Evanescence's guitar riffs aren't even riffs, and Amy Lee or whatever her name is sounds the same in every song. So stop blabbing about how Evanescence are pure geniuses and go buy yourselves some real music. <BR>Any comments? email me at geekslashnerd@yahoo.com
B00000JPHF|5.0|Frankenstein is the kind of horror movie that I remember watching on late Saturday nights growing up.  These old-time horror movies relied on psychological terror and strong acting performances rather than blood and guts to captivate an audience. Frankenstein succeeds on both of these counts.<br />Colin Clive stars as Dr. Henry Frankenstein and Dwight Frye stars as his hunch-backed assistant Fritz.  Dr. Frankenstein has taken to robbing graves in his effort to create his own human being.  In his search for a human brain, Fritz inadvertantly steals a brain from an evil person.  Frankenstein is unaware of this as he transplants the brain into his human.  What results is Boris Karloff's monster. However, Frankenstein's monster isn't the &quot;killing machine&quot; that we see in today's horror movies.  Rather, the monster seems to be searching for his own identity (witness the scene with the little girl near the river).  The people of the town perceive him to be evil when perhaps he is merely searching for acceptance.<br />The acting in the movie is excellent.  Colin Clive does a masterful job as Dr. Frankenstein, while Dwight Frye is excellent as Fritz.  The scenework, such as the shots of Dr. Frankenstein's castle and the final scene at the windmill are captivating as well.  I highly recommend this movie along with other classic horror movies of this time period.  They will bring back memories of sitting around the TV on dark Saturday nights and jumping up from your seat at each scary scene.
0808514121|5.0|The blurb on the back of this book says that it is a Biblical story, a modern retelling of the Cain and Able story.  But it is more than just a clever satire.  It is the story of humanity as Steinbeck perceives it, told as an allegory through two generations of two families in the Salinas Valley of California.  John Steinbeck reached very far into himself to write this book.  He has an incredble insight into human emotions - as I was reading his simple and beautiful prose I felt that he must have known me intimately to write to me so succintly and so personally.  As it was written fairly late in his life and his career, one gets the impression that he wanted to tell one final, ultimate story that would last forever.  This may be as close to that story as one man can get.<br />The last book I read was Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.<BR>The next book I plan to read is Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
B0000B1OFN|2.0|I read somewhere that Edward Norton appears in this film only due to contractual obligations. He thought the sceript was silly. And it is.<br />Man, what a stupid history. After a promising beginning, everything goes downhill. Walhberg, as always, is his wooden face best.<br />There's only a vague idea of a plot, nothing more. A big waste of time.
B0000B1OFN|4.0|This movie is awesome. Although I didnt have a chance to see it in theaters I went and bought it. It has already been watched 3 times so it has payed for itself. This movie starts out in Venice,Italy and moves to California. The minis in this movie are spectacular and skinny pete is great. well i am telling all of you to go buy this. Its great what else can i say about this movie.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|When this album was first released I listened to it constantly. The re-issue has arrived at a time when constant listening possibilities have extended. Now you can have Blood on the Tracks beamed into your head through your Walkman everywhere you go.  The quality of this re-issue makes you want to do that.  It was always the most absorbing music: the words, the tunes, every instrument, every pause, the songs rubbing up against one another, images and phrases bouncing and reflecting.  But I did not expect to get so much more out of something I already knew so well.  This may be because I am so much older/younger then/now - but it is also to do with the quality of this album.<BR>If you already love it, get the re-issue.  If you've never had it...you have one of the great musical experiences waiting for you.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Constantly evolving and proving they're still the best rock group in the world today, Radiohead had has managed to put out another unique album for the masses. Mixing styles of electronica, rock, quiet ballads and everything in between, its sure to entertain, satisfy and impress any Radiohead fan.<br />My favorite tracks:<BR>The Gloaming<BR>2+2=5<BR>Where I End and You Begin<BR>A Wolf at the Door<BR>I Will
B000089RVR|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic - I love it, can't stop listening to it, and don't think I'll ever grow tired of it! I'll keep this short and to the point (you really just have to hear it yourself to know how great it is!), but it combines meaningful, provocative lyrics with great music and Dido's amazing voice.  There are no songs on it that I consider &quot;skip over&quot; songs - they are all unique and wonderful in their own way. And this album is great for so many moods too - emotional, hopeful, thoughtful, and for just chilling and relaxing to. I just can't stress enough how great this album is and how amazing Dido is!!
B00005JKC3|2.0|When I heard they were going to make a film about the Hulk I got excited cause I thought it was going to be one hell of a thrill ride. Boy was I wrong, the graphics were good but there wasn't enough action. If you are going to make a film about the hulk you gotta make sure there is enough action and less talk. That's why I liked the comics, because they were quick and had a lot of action. This film was like an independent film with a great big monster on it. Ang Lee may be a talented director but he should stick to films like crouching tiger hidden dragon , and he should stay away from comic book movies in the future.
0451191153|5.0|I seldom care to read books of this length.  However, I was mesmerized and intrigued by the first 25 pages. While the story and characters were larger than life and quite twisted, I couldn't get enough.  I was completely drawn in by Howard Roark. And the relationship between Roark and Dominique was explosive.<br />I like to be taken away in a novel. In this case, I felt completely transported to the world of architecture, the powerful, and the elite.  I wouldn't want to live there, but it was a great ride.  Rand's philosophy and politics while interesting, was not the attraction for me. This book did not profoundly change my views, but Rand's style of writing and storytelling did have an effect on me as a creative individual.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This sounds like The Rolling Stones more than Mick 'n' Keef ever did. Imagine Oasis with a fixation for the Glimmer Twins instead of that for the Liverpool chaps. While in &quot;Get What You Need&quot; you have a song with a riff worth of inclusion in Let It Bleed or Beggar's Banquet, &quot;Move On&quot; is the way the Aussies play &quot;Wild Horses&quot;. &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; could be a lost song from the White Album sessions. &quot;Lazy Gun&quot; is the glam sound of T.Rex paired with John Lennon's dreams of diamond studded skies. Great stuff. Oh, and they look cool too.
B000059GEH|4.0|Marilyn Mnroe shines in this movie and all three ladies add a great comedic touch. Definately worth your money, you'll want to watch it many times
B00005JLXE|3.0|When I saw the movie I just couldn't get too excited over it. I didn't mind the plotline of 12 yr. old Matt Murdock being blinded by a splash of Industrial waste and soon after developing sonic vision, I just couldn't get into the story.<BR>Ben Affleck was all right as adult Matt but I think I liked the young actor who did Matt Murdock at 12 better. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra but you can see her doing much the same every week on TV in Alias,for what she probably cost they should've given her more screen time. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was pretty good although I think he gave up too easily in the climactic battle with Daredevil. <BR>The best fight scene in the movie, if you could call it that, was when Elektra and Matt Murdock had a sparring match on some teeter-totters in a playground.<BR>The extra's are what I'd most likely buy this one for.
B000089RVX|5.0|evanesce--to dissipate like vapour, disappear gradually, fade away.  [Latin:  evanescere, to vanish,  e (completely) vanescere (to pass away) from vanus (empty, vain)]<br />The songs on Evanescence's debut album, Fallen, fit in two different categories.  One is the blaring heavy nu-metal guitar and industrially-programmed drums over which Amy Lee sings, such as &quot;Going Under.&quot;  The others are gothic-style ballads of angst and pain that showcase Lee's beautiful voice, which is the real featured talent here.  Call Evanescence the Amy Lee Experience, if you will, or an alternative/nu-metal version of Tristania.<br />The first of two songs that were highlighted on the Daredevil soundtrack, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, has some terrific lyrics pleading an ideal to fill up one's dead and lifeless soul, in a gothic Frankenstein's monster kind of motif.  &quot;Wake me up inside/call my name and save me from the dark/.../save me from the nothing I've become.&quot;  And no, I don't mind the guest vocals by 12 Stones' Paul McCoy, nor the fact that it fits the first category.<br />The other Daredevil song, the painful loneliness piano ballad of &quot;My Immortal&quot; is more like it.  &quot;These wounds don't seem to heal/this pain is just too real/there's just too much that time cannot erase&quot; is indeed the soundtrack of my life right there, and Lee's McLachlan-like voice and the strings are like a warm hug I need.  The piano melodies are reminiscent of Enya.<br />Things become more gothic and spooky with &quot;Haunted&quot;, and Lee's vocals take on an eerie edge, as industrial synth drums and the pulsing nu-metal guitar kick in.  Things take on a disturbing edge, when the second chorus goes &quot;I can feel you pull me down/saving me r-ping me/watching me&quot; and the gothic choir adds to the weirdness.<br />The suicide song of the metal &quot;Tourniquet&quot;.  She likens God to her tourniquet and calls for a &quot;return to salvation.&quot;  At one point, I hear &quot;I want to die!&quot;  The angst of Lee's voice is felt when she sings &quot;My wounds call for the grave/my soul cries for deliverance.&quot;<br />&quot;Imaginary&quot; is something that Tristania might do, crunchy guitars mixed with a lovely female voice.  I love the dreamland aspect of this song and Lee's vocals really soar:  &quot;In my field of paper flowers/and candy clouds of lullaby/I lie inside myself for hours/and watch my purple sky fly over me.&quot;  I identify strongly with this line:  &quot;Don;t say I'm out of touch/with this rampant chaos-your reality/I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge/the nightmare I built my own world to escape.&quot;<br />In &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;, trying not to think of a lost love is problematic because &quot;who can decide what they dream?  And dream I do...&quot;  Lee's voice is a powerhouse, as are the metal guitars, which mirror her emotion.<br />&quot;Hello&quot; is a melancholy piano ballad showcasing Lee's voice and is of someone lost in a haze of daydreams:  &quot;Hello.  I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to.&quot;<br />Symphonic strings and heavy guitars lead off and continue throughout &quot;My Last Breath&quot; of a dying love.  A backing choir and a frantic strings back up &quot;Whisper&quot;, of a struggle to stay alive.  &quot;Don't turn away/don't give in to the pain/don't try to hide/though they're screaming your name.&quot;  The choir sing in haunting Latin, backed by strings towards the end.<br />Fallen is an attempt to mix crunchy nu-metal with lovely soaring Sarah McLachlan/Tori Amos type vocals.  The results surprisingly work, but it reminded me what attracted me to groups like Tristania.  However, on other songs, we see Amy Lee proving she can sing as well as Sarah McLachlan or Tori Amos.  She has so much potential here, that she'll have no problem getting a solo career, and when she does, to paraphrase from a song here--bring her back to life.  Just when I thought 2003 wasn't yielding a decent crop, out comes this magical mixing angry guitars and painful angst.asn't yielding a decent crop, out comes this magical mixing angry guitars and painful angst.
B00007GZVS|4.0|I gave it a rating of four stars, just because of the small confusion it caused because of its historical inaccuracy. In my opinion, however, this was a great film.  It was very well thought out and was possibly incorrect historically for entertainment purposes.  I think that was very clever too, which made it more exciting to watch.  The affairs that took place, and different conspiracys added suspense to the film, on the other hand had it been 100% accurate according to the actual history it would have been a bit of a drag, and not really movie material.  It would have been more like a biography, which is sometimes kind of boring to watch.  This film touched base with many different situations and aspects of the era, and kept me on my toes the entire time.
B00004W52U|4.0|Whew.  Op Ivy is something.  Look, they may have started the whole ska thing, but I consider them a punk band.  And a very good one at that.  Explicitly political, which is good, like my fav band Dead Kennedys.  The best (and most political) of these songs is Freeze Up.  Great guitar and bass.  Also good are...well, every song 1-19.  Nothing good after that.  Have fun!

B0000AXE8I|4.0|Given the philosophical bent of the Matrix movies, the whole point of the zion rave scene (and interlaced the Neo/Trinity scene) was to highlight what makes humans different from machines. What we were seeing is everything that machines are incapable of doing: reproduction, passion, losing control, pure enjoyment. <br />You can see more exploration of the human-machine dichotomy when Neo and the Councillor go down the depths of zion and discuss the humans-need-machines and machines-need-humans relationship. The main difference is that during that sequence, the point is spelled out for the slow viewers, whereas the point of the rave/sex scenes is more emotional (which again, is the point).
B00006DEFA|3.0|The first thing I did with this was watch the &quot;making of&quot; bonus documentary.  I had only recently re-watched the film, and wasn't sure I wanted to see it again, so soon.  But when I realized how much extra footage was there, I got curious.  With all the formerly excised bits put in, the flow of the narrative becomes clearer.  Salieri becomes more pathetically wicked, and Mozart becomes more worthy of our empathy; especially from the standpoint of &quot;the plight of the artist&quot;.  We more fully understand their motivations.<br />Even Mozart's wife's character is complexified, as well as their marriage (a short spat scene).  Thus it takes on a character unlike the original.  It's just a bit less &quot;easy&quot;, as most Hollywood productions are these days.<br />But I'm still not sure I prefer this.  This is because, although, as I say, this &quot;psuedo biography&quot; makes more sense in its narrative, the scenes that were added are sometimes questionable from a qualitative standpoint.  There is an American actor who plays a patron, for example, who hires Mozart to teach his young daughter music; but the scene is so over the top, that it's easy to see why it got cut.  Though, you'll understand (and it speaks volumes about how Mozart is portrayed), why Mozart is so smugly sucking on a wine bottle as he walks through the busy streets afterward.<br />But the scene in which I always thought Salieri's final reaction to Frau Mozart's ploy to get him to help them--wherein he drops the portfolio and leaves the room--makes a lot more sense here.  So some of the revived scenes fix small annoyances like this one.<br />So, as I say, if, like me, this is one of your favorite films, you won't be disappointed by this version, but you will begin to think, perhaps, that the film would have seemed a bit flawed if all of this had been released in the first place.  And even wonder if it would have been so popular.  So buy the original theatrical version, and rent this--you may like it, but it's left me conflicted--and thus you may decide for yourself before plonking down the loot, how you feel.<br />Some movies are like old friends, and it's a little difficult to adjust, if say, for instance they show up with a nose job....same deal here.nt this--you may like it, but it's left me conflicted--and thus you may decide for yourself before plonking down the loot, how you feel.  <br />Some movies are like old friends, and it's a little difficult to adjust, if say, for instance they show up with a nose job....same deal here.

B00005JLXE|3.0|I hate to say it, but I didn't really realize how good Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Spiderman was - until I saw the movie Daredevil!<br />In Daredevil, Ben Affleck's character is blind.  <br />He has but one extraordinary power - his supernatural hearing - which makes up for his lack of sight.  <br />He traverses around New York - and fights -- using a blind man's cane which converts into either a bungee-corded grappling hook, or a bladeless sword and nunchucks. <br />He gains purpose by killing street thugs - which is a punishment far in excess to the crimes they commit.<br />And he gets his lady friend to fall in love with him, unbelievably - by brawling with her on the playground! <br />On all levels, Spiderman is so much better!<br />Tobey Maguire - as a nerd - creates sentimentality in a much more engaging way.  His use of a web to trapeze around Gotham - and to entrap his opponents - is simultaneously much more graceful and humane.  His \\"spidey sense\\" and superhuman strength are infinitely more believable as comic hero tools.  And he wins his love's heart the old fashioned way - by saving her life.  Which, unfortunately, even the Daredevil fails to do!<br />Colin Farrell as Bullseye (Daredevil's nemesis) only adds to the movie's callousness.  He murders with pencils and paperclips, as though using innocuous devices somehow makes it ok.<br />And even Jennifer Garner, as Elektra Natchios, is unable to save the day.  Sure, she's gorgeous, and the sonic image of her created in the rain is easily the coolest special effect in the entire film.  But it didn't thrill me to see her stab the man she loves; or to take it herself in the gut!  And you really know something's wrong when the sexiest picture you can remember of her comes -- not from the movie itself - but from the leather-wrapped, rear view photo of her which appears on the DVD's box!<br />According to other reviews I've read, the original Daredevil was only a second-rate comic book superhero - and this moviereally shows off why!<br />This is a great film for fans of the genre.  But for the rest of us, Spiderman is an infinitely better ride!  Enjoy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Ok, so I'm slightly biased about this movie because I went to see it on my first date with my now fiancee, but honestly, it was just...magical!<br />Ok, it's not geared towards kids exactly. Well, it is and it isn't. Miyazaki is enthralled with childhood, and has managed to capture that feeling of being 10 years old like no one else in my experience.<br />While the english dub is excellent, the japanese version is just that much better. And the subject matter is pretty heavy for most young children, as it deals with growth from innocence to a more adult, yet not-quite-adult stage of development. Some concepts may be a bit too advanced for young children, but most kids 10+ should have no trouble understanding the movie's plot. And they may even identify with it.<br />What made this movie truly excellent was the score. Leave it to Joe Hisaishi to write a score that makes me, a full grown man who'se never cried at any movie ever, weep like a little girl! Hauntingly beautiful music adds so much to the overal presentation. If you are a fan of Miyazaki, or not, you should definitely check this out.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Somebody remember the controversy about the showing of the word &quot;SEX&quot; when Simba falls in the grass, and a lot  of dust fly with the wind?...<br />When i saw this movie in the Imax, i noticed that the dust was changed, and in this DVD version was altered too... no longer is visible the word SEX... i guess that Mike Eisner prefered this instead of calling all the copies of this DVD when the controversy show its ugly face again.

0060934913|5.0|I loved this book! Anthony Bourdain is a talented writer who wastes no time immersing the reader into the bowels of the restaurant world.<br />Not only does Mr. Bourdain provide delicious anecdotes about his restaurant experiences, he has some sage advice about choosing a restaurant, and why you shouldn't order seafood on the weekend. Since I've read Kitchen Confidential, I'm very careful about what I eat and where.<br />The author certainly has a way with words. He is as adept at writing as he obviously is at cooking. While reading Kitchen Confidential, I found Mr. Bourdain's descriptions to be so vivid that I could see, feel, smell and taste everything he had written about!<br />Before you head out to dinner on the town again, you should read Kitchen Confidential. Trust me, you won't regret it.
0767802470|5.0|This movie has many imitators, but no equals. U-571, Crimson Tide, The Hunt for Red October, and many others have tried to imitate the sheer power and unbelievable heroism that this movie shows. <BR>     U-571, for example, tried to take German heroism and their exploits and tried to make them into American ones. This really angered me, since there was no way that the Americans could have done that. However, it is completely shocking to me that the entire story of Das Boot is totally true. <BR>    These are more unsung heroes of WWII that few have really noticed. They deserve much more attention than they receive for their amazing heroism and ingenuity. <BR>     Anyway, this movie will change your view of war. Many feel that war is a glorius and exciting thing to take part in, but they are oh so terribly wrong. If you watch this movie, you will know what war is really about. Wolfgang Petersen will not deceive you.

0553573403|5.0|I have never been a great fan of fantasy literature. I do enjoy an occassional vampire novel or historical novel. Mr. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series is wonderful. A GAME OF THRONES has reintroduced me into the world of fantasy novels. Sure I have read and slept through the LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT(I still enjoyed them though) and I have read THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING. But I forgot about them over time. Tolkien's books are in a world so unlike our own. The young King Arthur is great when you are a teen. But I have grown to want a novel in the real world.  I do not mind vampires stalking about because it make our everyday seem scarier and more exciting than our 9 to 5 jobs or the courtroom drama, YAWN. This series is so real. It is like reading a well written historical novel. The world he constructs is a lot like England in the middle ages. In fact I think it is mentioned somewhere that the novel is loosly based on the War of the Roses. Unlike some series where one cannot turn a page without reading about a fairy sparkling with magic. Mr. Martin keeps the supernatural element at a distance. It is the stuff of myth. But slowly it is inching to the foreground through all the political conspiracies and battles. If you are into a more realistic novel where the fantasy is at a minimum, read this series. They are made up of a lot of pages but they are so fast paced that you'll wounder where the time went.

Oliver Stone read this fine script and understood every  fine point the script had and did his finest part to bring his understandings to the viewers. This movie is put together great and you will find a differant plot to the movie every time you enjoy it. It is truely one of the finest films made right behind Pulp Fiction.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I must admit to being slightly disappointed with the last couple of KC albums I have heard. This is not the case with &quot;The Power To Believe&quot;. For me, it combines the hard-edged sound of the Starless-Larks-Red era with the soundscapes and interlocking polyrhythms of Discipline. <BR><BR>The album leads off with some processed vocals (courtesy of Adrian Belew) in part one of the &quot;Power to Believe&quot; suite, which is non-descript enough. It does nothing to prepare the listener for the thunderous &quot;Level Five&quot;. It literally leaps out of the speakers and goes straight for the jugular. This track represents all that I love about the rowdy side of KC. It reminds me a bit of the title track from Red, with it's angry guitars, thumping bass and odd time signatures. Needless to say, it rocks! Following on from that onslaught is &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;, which is as beautiful as &quot;Level Five&quot; is brutal. This is somewhat reminiscent of the 80's period, with a sort of shimmering quality in both vocal delivery and the guitars. It's a wonderful contrast, which is certainly something KC excels at. Elektrik is kind of a mixture of the previous two tracks, with grinding heaviness but also periods of relative calm. It features some really nice, almost trance-y percussion, but then explodes into life, with some crushingly heavy guitar and huge drums. The next two tracks are &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; intro and main track. The former is a soundscape, in the fairly typical Fripp mould and the latter a Belew driven rock song. I don't care that much for the distorted vocals, but it has some tasty twin-lead guitar playing. A period of quietness descends for &quot;The Power to Believe II&quot;, which is sort of like &quot;Talking Drum&quot; from Larks. Nice enough and I like the gamelan style drumming. &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; follows, which builds up menacingly with a repeated riff over some atmospheric synths. It has an eery calm at the beginning and by the end is thundering away, with the transitions barely noticable. This track is one of my faves. &quot;Happy with...&quot; is another Belew track, which is OK, but doesn't stand up as well as the other tracks (the lyrics are a little grating), but the chorus is great. The last two track are the completion of the &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; suite and and have a beautiful, filmic quality, which is to say that they feel vast and spacious and probably wouldn't be out of place in a movie like Blade Runner. There are some loud bits, but they don't really alter the overall mood (dark, unsettling).<BR><BR> On the whole, I love this album. You can hear echoes of the past, for sure. But that doesn't bother me too much, as they styles they assimilated are the best parts of their 70's and 80's cannon (IMHO). Some might quibble that there is not necessarily a lot of forward looking music here, but that's OK with me. The fact that they can make a record as strong as this so late in their career is a testament to their talent and cohesion as a unit. Definitely recommended for KC fans and others who may be curious after seeing them tour with Tool.

B0000C7PQK|5.0|To start, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, not in Enigma... but in it's &quot;fans&quot;. Having thoroughly read through the other reviews, I can't help but notice how close-minded many of these people are. And these are the one's that said they expected something new...<br />People, it's plain to see the old Enigma sound is gone. Get over it. As a matter of fact, I remember reading something once about Screen being the end to the &quot;first world&quot;. Voyager is supposed to be the beginning of a &quot;new world&quot; so obviously the sound is going to be very different. And quite frankly, if your expecting the next album to go back to the sound of his previous albums... you might as well just get off the train now. Because the one your riding now does not head where you &quot;hope&quot; it may go. <br />Now, as for the album itself, it takes some getting use to. Too many people expect more of what they heard in his previous albums and tend to judge it on that sole fact. People also have judged the album for it's lyric's. People, an album does not need \\"deep\\" lyrics to be good. Ever think to just sit back and enjoy it for what it is? Not what you \\"think\\" it could/should be. I for one find this album fun to listen to. The &quot;trashy-euro pop&quot; as one person puts it, is a nice mix in. The fact he labeled it &quot;trashy-euro&quot; just re-enforces the fact he/she has probably never even stepped foot off of American soil and been fully expose to foreign music/culture. (Ah yes, America... the land of arrogance/ignorance. And before you ask, yes I'm American. Having grown up my entire life traveling the world, I have been exposed to so many new forms of music and tend to have an open mind to it) Oh yes, and by the way... Enigma is from Europe... can't help but wonder why there's a euro influence now can we?<br />Enough back talking for now, the bottom line is this: if your expecting a continuation of Enigma's previous works and have absolutely no room in your noggin for change... don't even bother buying this album. Save your money and go buy something else. Now, for the rest of us with open minds, you will probably enjoy the CD immensely. Much like I did. I won't bother to review each song, it's been done numerous times already, but know this, Enigma's new sound will definitely keep those of us willing to accept change coming back for more. Enigma has truly lived up to its name this album!

1582432678|4.0|Lionel Shriver's book, We Need to Talk About Kevin would have received 5 stars from me except for one thing.  I'm hardly an uneducated person and I do some writing myself, but her 75 dollar words so frequently used wearied me.  If I have to leaf through the dictionary every few pages, to find out what she's talking about, it discourages me from reading the book past the first chapters.<BR>However, the subject matter is dear to me as the mother of a son who is nothing like Kevin (and I'm nothing like Eva) but I've lived a life feeling in a sense much as does this fictional mother, for lesser reasons, due to my own son's problems. <BR>There is no answer to the question for mothers - are we to blame.  We are all different, one from another and our children, too are all individuals.<BR>The story ends with a shock, as most reviewers have mentioned. It's a story I'm glad that I read if for no other reason than it's always a pleasure to read well written novels on subjects other than sex and immature love. <BR>I usually opt for non-fiction, in fact originally I thought this book might be just that. <BR>My only respectful request is that if Ms. Shriver writes more novels that she tone down the big words that are unfamiliar to many of her readers.<BR>I hate to admit it, but I almost quit reading the novel early on because I found that I was constantly wondering &quot;what on earth does that word mean?&quot;. This was annoying and distracting. <BR>I read on, hoping that she'd ease up and come down to the level of ordinary readers who haven't swallowed a dictionary. To some extent I became used to her style but not completely comfortable with it. <BR>The story however was real enough to hold my interest and I fought my way through to the very end. I'm glad that I did.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Hollywood releases many heist movies but few carry it off like THE ITALIAN JOB. Opening with stunning views of Venice the audience is introduced to a group of unlawful crooks while pulling off the job of the lifetime: the theft of $35 million in gold bars. While driving through the Alps, Steve (Edward Norton) ambushes his comrades and takes the bounty for himself. The remainder of the movie involves his ex-comrades hunting him down and taking the gold back for himself. The catch scenes are full of action and adrenaline and the Mini Coopers are fun watch. It's a wonder how technology and clever minds united to separate Steve from his fortune. THE ITALIAN JOB is clearly a winner and shouldn't be missed. Also recommended in this genre is THE GOOD THIEF with Nick Nolte. Enjoy.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|Neil can be so good and soooo bad.  This one's pretty lame.  The song writing sounds real labored and the music just isn't that exciting either.  I read a review that said his guitar playing was like &quot;Santana on valium.&quot; Seems pretty accurate to me.  Not much of a concept either.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I just saw this film for the second time and I have to say it really is a classic horror film.  I really can't see much of anything that is wrong with it.  The music is great and the whole story is great as well.  I think it is safe to say that this is Carpenter's lone masterpiece, which is fine because I really think this is a film that will endure over the years and will still be scaring people for a long time.

B000024D4R|5.0|With all the attention surrounding, DarkSide of the Moon and The Wall, often Animals gets overlooked. Sure, there is Wish You Were Here, Meddle and even early work like Clouds and Saucer, but none of it compares. I am a big fan of Roger Waters/Pink Floyd and even Post Roger Waters, Pink Flyod, and everything they have done peeked at Animals. The combination of Hard Rock with a very Classically composed melady and lyrics, that you just have to listen to (because not only did they speak for that time, but they still relavent about today), all come together to produce the MOST UNDERRATED rock and roll album ever.<br />Animals, like The Final Cut, are very hard albums to get into. They aren't as flashy or have catchy songs like some of the more popular works, but they are strong works that need to be listen to over and over again to appreaciate how good they are. I know you may think why do I have to listen to it over and over again? Beacuse it is so good, that it takes time just for you to pick up how subtlly brilliant it really is.<br />Animals, is an album composed of masterful simple music, strengthened by David Gilmour's phenomenal guitar and  surrounding prolific lyrics from Roger Waters.  It simply starts and ends with a single aucoustic guitar and then takes off into another world with Dogs (This is quite possibly the best Floyd song ever, live version is even better), Pigs [Three different ones] and Sheep (a close second, in best Floyd best song ever). Dogs and Sheep anchor this album with David Gilmour's guitar, speaking to you when there are no lyrics, and accompanied by calming keyboards, that leave you in an almost transcendent state. You lose yourself when listening to Animals, before you know it, the album is over, you've been daydreaming for forty-five minutes and you want to listen to it again. This is simply a must own if you are a Floyd fan, even if you are just a small time fan.<br />...&quot;After a while, you can work on points for style. Like a club tie and a firm handshake, sudden look in the eye, an easy smile. You have to be trusted, by the people you lied, so when they turn thier backs on you, you get the chance to put the knife in.&quot;
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd's 2-CD set \\"Echoes\\" is the first official \\"best-of\\" released by this band, which spans the eccentric psychedlia-laden days of 1967 to the Gilmour-led \\"Division Bell.\\" And surprisingly, for a band that put out such a long body of album-based music, this compilation holds up well, even though it pales next to their classic albums (\\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" or \\"Meddle\\" just to name a few). The tracks are not sequenced in chronologial order, which to me, is a great thing, since with a band like Pink Floyd, you never really care about what era a particular song is from and just concentrate on the music. <br />The opening cut on disc one is the spage-age psychedelic piece \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" (from the classic first album \\"Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\") and is a pretty darn good opener in my opinion. Syd Barrett's musical genius is reinforced yet again with the inclusion of \\"Astronomy\\" as well as a few other cuts he did with the band. This is quite amazing, since he only appeared on the first two albums (the second one in a limited capacity before being replaced by David Gilmour). Another neat feature is the use of sound effects to transition from one song to the next. I think this only made sense since transitions were a huge part of Pink Floyd's albums. The helicopter noise taking us from 1967's \\"See Emily Play\\" to 1979's \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" is one particularly good example of this. The wind noises used to transition Meddle's \\"One of These Days\\" to Dark Side's \\"Us and Them\\" also work quite nicely. If this was issued in chronological form, I don't think it would have had nearly the same impact.<br />This is the perfect place for anybody who is just starting to get into Pink Floyd (though I'd also strongly recommend \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"). It covers all eras of the band and their evolution is noticeable throughout. It also contains a rare cut (\\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" from the Wall movie soundtrack). This was actually my first Pink Floyd album, although I had heard a lot of their stuff before (from the radio or old vinyl records) and liked it. After this, I quickly became a fan, and for the past two years, I have amassed a decent Floyd album collection (along with two t-shirts). And I must admit that I don't listen to this album much anymore after hearing their proper albums. <br />However, as an experienced Floyd listener, there are a couple of flaws that I've noticed regarding some of the tracks here (don't pay any attention to this if you are only a casual listener). I think \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" should have been removed. I don't particularly like the album it came from (1983's The Final Cut), and I think that it is far too bleak, both musically and lyrically. I realize that Roger Waters frequently wrote pessimistic lyrics, but I think by that time he had taken it too far. Also I wish they would have included stuff from the More soundtrack instead of just focusing on the more well known albums. But these are just minor nitpicks. I don't expect everybody to agree with me.<br />If you are just now getting into Pink Floyd, then I encourage you to pick this one up. I would also recommend Dark Side in addition to this so you can get a feel for an actual album.
B000002HK4|5.0|Creo que este disco es bastante bueno, es increible como Dream Theater es capaz de tocar perfectamente canciones de grupos tan increibles como Pink Floyd o Genesis. Y lo mas importante este disco es que esta la obra maestra de Dream: Change of Seasons, una cancion que dura mas de 20 minutos y que todos sus integrantes muestran sus dotes de manera increible, fenomenal.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The original Matrix was one of the most important films in the last decade, if anything only because it was largely responsible for triggiring the boom in the DVD market.It was a new experience in digital enjoyment, and changed forever the tastes of the buying public.<BR>Martix Reloaded is the long  awaited sequel, second in a trilogy, and which did not fare well in the box office contrary to the huge expectations.However,I did find the low review marks and the negative feedback quite harsh and unfair, because there is a very important point lost on many:<BR>Not unlike Lord of The Rings, The Matrix should be judged when all three films are FINALLY out, as they are closely interconnected and can be seen and reviewed as one whole viewing experience. The sequel might not be as good as the first, but then it does not matter as much as the fact that it is the whole trilogy that should be assessed.<BR>The story of Matrix might be at times confusing, and at others quite simple(Its biblical/philosophical undertones/men against machines in an apocalytpic future, is a subject that has been treated extensively in cinema, from the all time masterpiece of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey to dozens of lame straight to video imitations), but this becomes secondary to the immense pleasure one gets from the viewing experience itself, the fights, action, digital wizadry, music and production design,in the first Matrix as well as in its sequel Reloaded. One fact is clear and can not be denied, the Washowski brothers have done a wonderful job in achieving this.<BR>I liken this experience to my love of African music: the whole vibe,groove and the beautiful voices compensate amply for  not understanding the meaning of the words and what they are singing about.<BR>The two Matrix films should,in a way, be looked at similarily, you might not like the story,or the way it is going ,but you will sure be in for a magical digital ride that will capture all your senses.A cinematic masterpiece it may not be, but it is certainly the ultimate DVD experience.
B000005HFH|5.0|The soft, simple sometimes shaky voice of Chet Baker can turn a love song into a brooding lament and break your heart. His interpretation of &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; is a masterpiece of vocal jazz, and the best I have ever heard. Baker brings an emotional depth and intensity to the songs on this 25 track CD that make it probably the best compilation of his vocal music.<br />Some of my favorites are the mournful and haunting &quot;But Not For Me,&quot; &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot; and &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is.&quot; There's the mellow and beautiful &quot;Long Ago and Far Away,&quot; and &quot;Time After Time.&quot; Other great songs include &quot;My Buddy,&quot; &quot;Just Friends,&quot; and, of course &quot;My Funny Valentine.&quot; His trumpet is superb and he sings these wonderful romantic ballads with the smokiest, saddest, sexy sound. This is the BEST!<br />JANA
B00008EY9G|5.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  After all, headlining it were John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet, three actors that I've come to respect and admire.<br />I had high hopes.  And I wasn't disappointed! (It didn't hurt anything that Jake Busey had a role, either...)<br />IDENTITY is a movie unto itself.  It's not the greatest phsycological suspense movie ever made (Hitchock probably had a hand in that movie) but it's pretty damn good.<br />Okay, here's the plot: ten strangers wind up, by chance (or so it seems) at a motel in the middle of nowhere, on a night filled with rain, thunder, lightning, and all the rest of that suspensful stuff.  Among them are: a limo-driver (Cusack) and his employer; a prostitute (Peet) heading home for Florida; a man, his stepchild, and his wife (who's involved in an accident before she reaches the hotel); a young newlywed couple; and a cop (Liotta) escorting an inmate (Busey).  Also thrown into the mix is the manager of the hotel who, while no Bates, possesses an air of innocent mystery.<br />Everything, while not alright, is certainly not dangerous...until the convict escapes, and the killings begin.<br />But there is a question that plagues the occupants of the hotel: is the convict really the killer?  And if not him...then who?<br />Trust me, ladies and gents--despite what you think, you'll not be able to predict the ending of this awesome, creepy, thought-provking, and downright enjoyable movie.  The ending is, indeed, what I would consider to be a classic--I just wish I could tell you more, but I can't.<br />In this movie, no one--and I mean no one, ladies and gents--is who they seem to be.  And that's what makes this movie--much more than a glorified &quot;who-dunit&quot;, in case that's what you were thinking--so suspensful and exciting.<br />IDENTITY is a rarity: a movie for adults (don't go into this expecting a simple, Barney-esque plot) that gives its viewers a childish glee.  A must-see!  I mean it.
B000002I27|4.0|Has anyone cared to comment on the &quot;strange&quot; noises that pop up in the song &quot;Strange Days&quot;? It's even worse on the 1999 remaster! As if they tried to fix a somehow-botched master tape but made it worse. Truly unforgiveable. The rest of the songs on the CD came out fine.
0783113943|1.0|Angeline Jolie shows all her assets in this HBO crapfest...and after her clothes hit the floor, she's got nothing left. Monkey lips tries to portray a model, but ends up looking like a stripper throughout most, and can't ennunciate to save her idiotic life. Can you say, &quot;Thanks, Dad&quot;?
B00005JM0B|4.0|Let me start by saying that if you haven't seen this movie, & don't know, or don't want to know how it ends, stop reading this review now, because the ending will be discussed.  Rather than just simply reviewing the movie, I'd like to say what I liked better about it than T2.  First off, it gets closer to revisiting the darkness of the original (and still the best in my opinion).  The fact that the nuclear war happened at the end of this film is what made it for me.  I was expecting another all ends well summer movie ending, but instead I got total anhilation.  Great ending.  And, even though some purists will likely vomit at this next statement, I think they opened up the series so that they could credibly do future sequels without Arnold.  I think there's an interesting story to be told in John Connor and the resistance, that wouldn't nesecarily need Arnold's Terminator, as long as they use the robotic endoskeleton.  <BR>     Now, here's what I liked better about T3 than T2.  No whiny, lame-ass teenager teaching The Terminator stupid catch phrases and how to cry.  No Terminator giving the Fonzie thumbs-up (\\"Heey, I'm being meltedamundo!).  I mean, c'mon, who wants to see a sensative Terminator?  \\"I think I know now why you cry.\\"  Please.  Personally, I think Cameron not writing the script is an asset.  He's a good director, but even in his best films (T1 & The Abyss) there's some absolutely terrible dialog.  The lame catch phrases like \\"Hasta La Vista, Baby\\" and \\"No Problemo\\" were just plain stupid.  As was the entire concept of making The Terminator kid friendly was an insult to the memory of the relentless Terminator from the first film.  He's not supposed to be funny and clever, he's supposed to be an awesome killing machine!  Don't get me wrong, Robert Patrick & the liquid metal Terminator were amazing & in my opinion what made T2, which I do like, just not as well as 1, or now 3.<BR>     My hope for the future of the series now is that either it ends with 3 or that it progresses so future films are not about a robot being sent back through time yada yada yada, but rather take place after the nuclear holocaust in the war between man & machine.  Sure it would change the feel and style of the series, but in my opinion that's a good thing.  After all, can they really improve on 1 in any aspect other than special effects?
B00006BSC8|5.0|Leolo is a powerful, one of a kind masterpiece. I have never seen a film with such great photography, writing and acting. The first time I saw this movie in a theatre, the audienced sat stunned in their seats, after it ended and the lights came on. Mr. Lauzon was the best kind genius.
B0000508U6|2.0|All Coldplay is, is The Catherine Wheel without balls.  Quite simply this band (coldplay, that is) doesn't rock.  They play whiny complaint rock &amp; the feel and sentiment of the &quot;hidden track&quot; is just a rip off of the untitled final track off CW's 1997 album Adam &amp; Eve.  Chris Martin's voice is nearly identicle to Rob Dickinson from CW's, which is particularly apparent on Spies (although I do like the rhythm section on that song).  The best song is the last one (before the hidden track), but all in all, these guys aren't good enough to lick the bottom of Catherine Wheel's lowest paid roadies former roomate's shoes.  Don't get me wrong, this album is light years ahead of anything the likes of Oasis or Blur could even hope to concieve of, but still, in the words of CW's shoegazer contempararies Ride, &quot;If I've seen it all before, why's this bus taking me back again&quot;.  <BR>It's not absolute crap, but it's just been done before and better.  By many, many,  many bands.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded is probably one of the finest jobs of using computer animation along with a movie. The car chase scene on Highway 101 is perhaps in the top three only to Bullitt and the Seven Ups. Interestingly, Agent Smith becomes a computer virus which replicates himself to kill Neo. A scene in the movie involves Neo trying to fend off about a hundred Agent Smiths. The potholes of the sequel are the following.<BR>1. The movie is more predictable than the last.<BR>2. Neo flying just sets a lousy vibe throughout the movie.<BR>3. The idea of a backdoor is corney.<BR>Besides that, this is a solid four star movie. If you enjoy sci-fi thrillers or enjoy big car chase movies, I would definitely buy the Matrix Reloaded on DVD. Buying the VHS would be a waste of the tremendous special effects throughout the movie.
B0000942HV|1.0|the new version shows that Mike has no money and he wants to desperately get our money and interest by making another bells after another.we had &quot;Tubular bells II&quot;,&quot;Tubular bells III&quot;,&quot;The millenium bell&quot;,&quot;the best of tubular bells&quot; and now we have this.<BR>truly - the original reminds still after 30 years one of his best albums and one of the best albums of instrumental rock.<BR>get the Tubular bells&quot; from 1973,don't even touch this!
B000002AP1|4.0|The title of this album is just perfect. It suits the music so well and it's so, so true.<br />Plug in the headphones, put this cd in the lid and turn the volume all the way up - now you're ready for one of the loudest, most unforgiving sonic assaults in the history of all things rock & roll.<br />Greg Lasley was right in some of his assersions, yeah they did try out studio muscians for the band but promptly flew the Asheton brothers over when that didn't work out. Considering Bowie actually saved Iggy's career and allowed him a chance to record again, I think he deserves some credit for this. Your point about the production being shoddy in the original I agree with, although that's the very point of this remix being made (and the remix is of course the version we're referring to here).<br />Something else to note, a quote from the long interview with Iggy in the booket, \\"I don't think a new version improves the record, it just gives people who admire a strong rock band, and particularly people who are used to hearing things at today's standards of technology, a chance to hear that band in a way that's legible, audible, in a way that the original record was not.\\" Iggy gives credit to Bowie's original mix (particular tracks Gimme Danger & You're Pretty Face) and makes it quite clear he's giving a new perspective on the record instead of trying to overshadow Bowie's mix.<br />Sometimes you hear music and you read people saying stuff like 'This music absolutely shocked people when it was first released', but you can't really hear it. Well, with the new remix, which turns everything right up to red, the album still has the same pummeling effect it must have had in 1973.<br />Highlights on this album are definitely 'Search & Destroy', 'Gimme Danger' & 'Raw Power'. Search & Destroy is the perfect opener setting the bar for the rest of the songs both musically and lyrically. It's one of the most memorable Stooges tracks. Gimme Danger is the only Stooges track really drivenmainly by piano (except probably Rubber Legs), and is the ballad on side one ('ballad' in the loosest sense of the term). Raw Power is similar to 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' (self-titled) in that it's complemented by a piano repeating the same note over through the song and ends up equally as essential as it's cousin. It's just basic, straight ahead rock and it's the band at their best.<br />This is just raw rock & roll being taken to the very extreme. And it sounds awesome!
0671027344|5.0|I couldnt put the book down. I just loved it.
0780631684|1.0|My god this movie is overrated! Okay, so it has an intelligent story. That's only part of what makes a movie great. The other parts are script, cast, believable character reactions, and direction. In one scene, a guy gets the top of his head chopped off. Instead of the characters screaming or showing some empathy for the dead guy, they simply discuss the design of death. Hello? A guy just got KILLED! Oh, and in another scene, the main character (who is, by the way, really annoying and unlikeable) learns his best friend has apparantly killed himself, and he is blamed for the grief which apparently made his friend kill himself. So, is the guy sad because his friend is dead? No, he's angry because he was blamed. Oh, and the whole movie he talks about how death is inevitable. Well, after a period of time this seems right. Well, somehow him and his girl and this other jerk are able to avoid death. Let me explain: THIS IS DEATH THAT'S AFTER THEM, NOT A SLASHER KILLER! YOU CAN'T JUST DODGE DEATH! WHY? BECAUSE ANY OBJECT IS A TOOL FOR DEATH TO USE TO KILL! AND THESE PEOPLE CAN JUST PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM SOMETHING THAT CAN USE ANYTHING TO KILL?! In one part, the main character makes this house in the woods as safe as he can on the inside. So he's safe? The movie would like to make you think that. See, there are still 5 billion other ways he could get killed! To name a few: Tree falls on house, wind breaks glass and glass flies into face, or even slips on floor and breaks neck! I mean if death can make computer chips fly out of computers and stab people, he can certainly do that. If it were done the right way, this could be a classic. Instead, it's another teen horror flick.
B000002KY8|5.0|In my opinion, this is the body of work that made Prince who he is, made Michael Jackson work harder, brought funk back &amp; gave creativity back to pop music. Everyone from Madonna to Janet to..well, everyone!..copped flavors of his style. By the time Purple Rain was released we'd enjoyed songs written by him done by the likes of Cyndi Lauper &amp; Chaka Khan (When You Were Mine &amp; I Feel For You) to name a few. From beginning to end pure genius (excuse the cliche!!). Even the title tune, though the year is long past, the party rages on in its high-strung, funky tracks!!! A must have even if you aren't a big fan.
B00006RAKP|2.0|First of all, the third &quot;bonus&quot; disc on this set is one of the poorest excuses for a bonus CD I've ever seen. It could have been so much more. That said, the other two discs aren't much better. Yes, the set contains a bunch of hits. So what? It also leaves out a bunch of hits. Also, as I said, the bonus CD is ridiculous. I wish Elton John would do something like Paul McCartney did with his recent Wings Greatest Hits. Compile all the hits (-ALL- of them would be nice), and then add another disc of album tracks that were never released as singles. Contrary to what another reviewer below said, this ISN'T the only Elton John CD you'll ever need. That kind of thinking shows just how much people know about Elton John's music (as in, they know nothing about it). He's got at least 50 more incredibly good, essential songs that will probably never see the light of day while an incomplete &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; set gets released every other year. I though it was bad enough that Elton's biggest selling CD to date is the 1974 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; which has only, like, eleven songs, with about a hundred more ignored (yes, even in 1974 it leaves out a bunch of stuff. How about a Best Of occasionally, instead of just releasing the singles over and over?), but this CD is even more irritating considering how much more material they could have added after all these years. And I could have done without the Aida track. Meh.<BR>And about Cold as Christmas, I agree. But can anyone say Empty Garden?!?!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Great Album. I've been a great fan of Enigma and I must admit he has tried a change with this album and he has come out with flying colors. Words cannot express this album. Different sounding than the previous albums. My pick from this album is definitely the song &quot;Boum Boum&quot;. All numbers are great but Voyageur and Incognito are ok. Listen to this album a few times and you will definitely like it. Cretu is wonderful and this will be a good one for the collectors.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This has to be Madonna's more introspective album, more than &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, adopting for the first time her original brunette style hair, this is Madonna attempt to be more real than ever, Like A Prayer, Oh Father, Pray For Spanish Eyes, Act of Contrition, Promise To Try, are the cuts that are so deep into their lyrics that reveal a Madonna far away from the pop-material-girl that we are used to, Cherish is a pure example of a uplifting song, Express Yourself declares independence, Keep It Together rejoices about the importance of family values, in all Madonna's &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; will leave you satisfy and longing for the next Madonna step, such a great classic album, worth every penny. <br />Ricardo
B00004U30D|5.0|I'm responding to the reviewer \\"Father Knows Best\\", who went on the usual neo-conservative \\"anti-PC\\" rant. First of all, existentialism is by no means the same as Nazism, is not neccessarily godless, and in fact was not the brainchild of Heidegger. Existentialist philosophy was espoused by a broad range of thinkers: Kirkegaarde, Sartre, Camus (who was in fact an instrumental part of the anti-Nazi Resistance, get the cliched anti-French puns out of the way now). American Beauty is not trying to promote any agenda, it is merely an attempt to reveal that suburbia's tranquility is often a front for the same kind of savagery and alienation experienced elsewhere. As for Nazism's persecution of homosexuals, that is a documented fact. Roehm may have been a homosexual, however many of Hitler's other underlings did not conform with his image of a master race. Hitler himself was not a blue-eyed, blond-haired \\"Aryan,\\" it is not suprising that he tolerated other \\"imperfections\\" in his lieutenants. Denying persecution of homosexuals in the Nazi era is equivalent to those fanatics who deny the very existence of the Holocaust. Condemnation of homophobia, as depicted in American Beauty, seems to me to be nothing to be ashamed of. The homophobic military officer being a closet homosexual is not slander on the US military, but an example of something known as irony. As for educated people such as Ball and Mendes not having a basic knowledge of existentialism, one of the most influential worldviews of the century, that is just absurd. Legitimate criticism of the film-making in American Beauty, though I enjoyed it, would be appreciated, but let's keep the hackneyed Rush Limbaugh rants to ourselves, please. American Beauty, in my opinion, was an excellent movie that made an intelligent statement.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This has to be the perfect example on how the street beats where handled back then, Madonna has always used in a good way the dance sounds, her debut album is a classic compilation of pure early 80's fresh sound beats, it's worth to listen, and so purely deserves a greater admiration than 1984's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, just because it was more truer than anything in her sophomore album, &quot;Lucky Star&quot; simple video that captures everybody's attention, this is the first top ten for Madonna, &quot;Borderline&quot; a long lasting song, what a pleasure to listen to this ballad make a dance joint, &quot;Burning Up&quot; a little bit of new wave on it, this is a rocker, &quot;I Know It&quot; popish beat, with great results, &quot;Holiday&quot; should be consider Madonna's celebration joint, this is a total dance classic for all times, &quot;Think Of Me&quot; the most boring of all, but still worth the listen. &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; sexy, it gives us the idea where Madonna was leading!, &quot;Everybody&quot; the first single, #1 on the club charts! dance and sing get up and do your thing with this classical dance album!
B00005AFMT|5.0|I've often made the case that people should not complain about '70's progressive bands making more mainstream and accessible music in the '80's, and for a number of reason. It was a different decade, the music industry had changed, and there was a greater emphasis on hit singles and instant radio airplay. Synthesizers were coming into the forefront, and disco, while dead, had left it's mark, making pop music more dance-oriented. And finally...of all the pop music in the '80's, the '70's bands made the best of it. Compare Rush's music in the '80's to Soft Cell...who's better? Rush, of course. Compare Yes' &quot;90125&quot; album to Human League's &quot;Fascination&quot;...which is better? &quot;90125&quot; of course.<br />So with &quot;Discipline,&quot; the first of King Crimson's three '80's albums with ringleader Robert Fripp on guitar, Adrian Belew on vocals and guitar, ex-Yes and King Crimson alumni Bill Bruford on drums, and bassist and stickman extraordinaire Tony Levin. The music has a very distinguished '80's feel to it, and yet the high production quality and musical intricacy makes it sound as fresh today as it did back in 1981. The use of the guitar synthesizer on the part of Fripp and Belew makes for some impressive sounding guitar effects. But this album is also about musicianship. Levin's bassmanship and his work on the stick make for some impressive backdrops that balance greatly with Belew's and Fripp's interweaving guitar lines. This album almost made me quit playing the guitar, it was so complicated. The fretwork on &quot;Frame by Frame&quot; where the two guitarists play the same melody, but in different time, makes for a unique effect no delay pedal could imitate. Bruford's drumming is on the beat and very precise, keeping the band in time, even as they play the most complicated melodies and harmonies over each other. Belew's vocals are also impressive with a David Byrne-esque tone (perhaps a resonance from his having played with the Talking Heads?), singing sweet melodies over songs one might not expect to fit in a vocal context. His lyrics are also good, showing a sense of stream of consciousness, and not afraid to take a humorous turn occasionally.<br />While not progressive in the symphonic sense, this album proves that new wave can find its way into a progressive setting. Still sounding good today, this is an album of and ahead of its time, showing that same progressive spirit Fripp had shown in the '70's. Time signatures change all over the place, intersecting harmony lines, this album is the work of a quartet of dedicated musicians out to show what they can do. And it is a beautiful sound. Put away your preconceptions on what progressive music should sound like. &quot;Discipline&quot; is an album of great music.
B00005J6SZ|1.0|Well, if there is a description to Madonna's Like A Virgin album, it should be : RUSHED,  after the growing success of  Madonna's debut album, they pushed back this album, but if they had a little more time, why they didn't choose better songs? , this album is crowded with fillers: Angel(this in no way a Madonna song), Love Don't Live Here Anymore(so anoying!), Shoo-Bee-Doo(oldie by Madonna? common!), Pretender and Stay(simply boring). All the previous tracks are pure pop tunes that missed that delicious street beat that made Madonna a star, thank God she made it trough with &quot;True Blue&quot; where she went for a more pop-rock oirented way, but even though &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; it's the best selling album of Madonna, for me is one of the worst!,  the only song worth mention are &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; ahead of its time with those amazing lyrics, and great beat first #1 for Madonna, &quot;Material Girl&quot; even though is well known that Madonna now hates this song, it's a truly Madonna Classic, after all she's named the Material Girl, and I Can't Believe! This wasn't #1, &quot;Over And Over&quot; I believe this should have been a better single release than the lame &quot;Angel&quot; wich I don't consider in any way a Madonna joint, don't you agree?, &quot;Dress You Up&quot; I dislike this one, but I guess many people will like it.  If this album should have included killer tracks of that time by Madonna like Crazy For You #1, Gambler and Into The Groove, would have save the album integrity, but I guess Madonna lost her street and danceable ways here, The only explanation I have for the success of Like A Virgin are the amazing first two singles releases: the title cut and Material Girl wich were incredible pop songs produced by funk genious Nile Rodgers!, definetly skip this one and buy the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;.
B00008EY9G|4.0|its a long and strange trip.  the story of ten strangers who end up at a motel and start dying, which is something you probably know from every other review.  what we all do not know (that is until we see the movie) is who is doing what to who and why.  <BR>    starring jon cusack, ray liotta, rebecca de mornay, jake busey, amanda peet (she played the dentists assistant in whole 9 yards) and clea duvall (also in Ghosts of mars).  all of them add up to a nice ensemble cast who deliver a great performance.  i think the cigar goes to Pruitt Taylor Vince who plays Malcolm, a man who has &quot;problems&quot; and is the center of our story.  i do not want to reveal too much because despite reviewer rbrogan3's claim of a cliche and bad ending, i think this movie delivers on all counts and you will not see the end coming until it is upon you.  <BR>     as for the dvd features, well, there is some deleted scenes while interesting are not mindblowing.  there is a good documentary that was aired on stars, storyboard comparisons, and the trailer.  the widescreen version has an alternate ending which is very cool.  all in all a  great movie that really plays with reality and time well while delivering not only a great story but has some excellent details and some great sub-plots all ending in a worthwhile trip.
B00005J6T0|5.0|If Like A Virgin rocketed Madonna to stardom, True Blue made her an Icon!, anything made wrong in &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was erased here, this is Madonna at her peak! of course in the 80's, all the songs are worth listening, and with different styles and beats, &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; was pure rock and roll and controversy by those days, because it was pushin' the bottoms about pregancy at a teenager stage, and of course Madonna kept her baby!, &quot;Open Your Heart and Where's The Party&quot; pure danceable tracks, of joyful times, pure pop gems!, &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; the fascination of Madonna with the Latino Culture, so delightful to hear, a different Madonna more deeply lyrics!, &quot;White Heat&quot; soulful, street sounds!, &quot;Live To Tell&quot; how about that!, Madonna could deliver an amazing ballad, with so much strenght, great song!, &quot;True Blue and Jimmy Jimmy&quot; 50's a like songs, great stament of loving someone forever!, &quot;Love Makes The World Go Round&quot; a little bit of dance-freestyle sounds, True Blue should be consider one of Madonna's must have albums, not only for fans, but for everybody in the world, this album is great!. Sold more than 7 million copies in the USA alone!, and 3 #1 singles!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  Anyone who hasn't seen it yet should do so as soon as possible.  For those who have seen it, the soundtrack is just as incredible as you remember it being from the movie.  The diverse genres and sounds of the movie blend perfectly with the snippets of dialogue.  This CD is a worthy companion to the best Tarantino film yet.
B00006M183|5.0|First I Own all the Pearl Jam albums and a few live ones they released, so I got to riot act with great anticipation, I wasnt expecting a third contender to the greatest Pearl Jam albums ever (Ten, and Yield). But Riot Act is defentaly a contender worthy of the crown. With all the new crap clouding up new rock radio now and days, thank god we have Pearl Jam, and great albums like Riot Act to break up the static.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|only gave this 2 stars because its maiden, but more closer to 1 star...whats my beef with it? the band is done, these riffs are done, the whole thing is done, I am a big maiden fan, ever since their first album with paul as the singer, I always loved every album they came out with, but this is pethetic, Given, I only listened to it once, so maybe ill give it a second spin and edit this post later, but my problem was every riff, or lyric on here has all been done on their previous album, there is a song that seriously rip of there classic works. I found my self stopping at each song saying &quot;this is a rip off of fear of the dark, or &quot;peice of mind&quot;, or &quot;somewhere in time&quot; and so on and so forth, and when I wasnt sayign the songs were ripped of, I was sayign the songs were boring.................to all: stick to classic maiden, or by there new dvd visions, its more worth it then this.

B000002MJC|5.0|This album has something really special..the thing is, that after listening to it for the first time you just get hooked to it! The harmony is quiet perfect during the whole album, even if there are some songs that really come out..this may not be a so consistent album as &quot;Ultra&quot; but in it are some of Depeche Mode's best tracks in my opinion, and the general atmosphere is simply unique.<br />The high points of the album are songs like the opening &quot;I feel you&quot;, which is the more &quot;single&quot;-oriented track in album, &quot;Rush&quot; and the three real masterpieces of the album: &quot;Walking in my shoes&quot; (the lyrics are really great), &quot;In Your Room&quot; (maybe the most powerful song) and the perfect final track &quot;Higher Love&quot; which is for me one of the most touching songs Depeche Mode's ever done.<br />It is really difficult to describe this album because it is simply unique. It can only be compared to the album &quot;Ultra&quot;, the two are absolutely great records and the best from the band!
B0000C9V3T|4.0|The movie was great and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. Sound goes in through your ears and starts to get your blood moving before the opening scene with Sinatra's Bang Bang. Some thing so great can only have been put to gether by the RZA but alas. The only tune that isnt on this album is the haunting tune that Elle Driver whistles as she strolls on to give the lethal injection. If anyone knows where thats at let me know. If it wasnt for that small detail it would have gotten the max rating but this CD is a must have whether youve seen the movie or not.
6305546789|5.0|In 1978, the world was introduced to a movie that has become a cornerstone in the horror genre.  Independent filmmakers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, largely unknown at the time, shot a movie that would become one of the top money-making horror films of all time on a budget of just over $300,000.00.  They hired a cast of unknowns, drawing on talent that would become some of the top names in Hollywood.  They set out to make a simple film, about a group of teenagers being stalked by a serial killer, and what was born was a movie that has challenged all other films of its genre-Halloween.<br />Set in the small town of Haddenfield, Illinois, it is the story of Michael Myers, a boy who murders his sister on Halloween night in 1963.  Incarserated within the confines of the mental institution Smiths Grove, he is treated by Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance) until he can stand trial as an adult for the criminal activities of that fateful night.<br />Fifteen years pass, and Myers is now grown.  Loomis is assigned the duty of transporting Myers back to Haddenfield for his criminal hearing.  On the eve of halloween, and badgered by a horrendous thunderstorm, Loomis travels the final distance to the gates of the institution with the aid of a nurse who has been assigned to him.  Upon their arrival, they discover that the inmates have been set free to wonder about the confines of the sanitarium.  Loomis, who has long since grown to believe that Michael Myers in the embodiment of pure evil, rushes to the gaurd post at the front gate.  In his absence, Myers overtakes the nurse and steals the car.<br />Loomis cries out &quot;He's gone..the evil has gone...&quot;<br />And so begins Halloween.<br />The balance of the story takes place in Haddonfield, where a group of unsuspecting teens will have a fatal encounter with Michael Myers.  Leading the cast is Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh (of &quot;Psycho&quot; fame), who plays Laurie Strode, a high-school student who begins seeing &quot;The Shape&quot;, a non-descript man dressed in a blue coverall, wearing a white mask.  She sees him again and again, through the classroom window at school, in her backyard, behind bushes.<br />For the majority of horror fans who have seen this film, I need go no further.  For those of you who haven't, I should go no further, for the film is definitely more than the narrative I began above.  It is a story that touches on the psychological truths that our society seems to function on.  Whats more, it is a film that touches at our primal fears.<br />Unlike so many films in this genre, Halloween is genuinely frightening, not because of its use of graphic gore, or visually stunning effects (there really aren't any in this film) but because it plays on the things that scare us most.  Whats more, Carpenter uses carefully placed light and shadow to really enhance the experience of his film.  His soundtrack also underscores the film as a whole, bringing it to a level and intensity that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br />Carpenter went on to film two additional films in the franchise, the much more commercial Halloween II and Halloween III:Season of the Witch (the third installment having nothing to do with the Myer storyline).  The Halloween franchise itself has given birth to a total of seven sequels, including the largely popular Halloween H20, in which Jamie Lee Curtis reprised the role of Laurie Strode.  Still, it is this original film, a small budget, independent movie that was shot in the early spring (yes, leaves were brought in and scattered about to simulate the fall season) that has become a staple that is synonymous with the holiday which the movie was named after.<br />If you have reservations about this film, set them aside and watch it...but watch it with the lights on, because Michael Myers might be there, in the shadows, waiting.  Halloween-the Night He Came Home-is worth the time and money.  It is the film that really re-defined the horror/slasher genre, and it is the one film that really rises above the rest, setting a standard that no film that followed has ever matched.t really re-defined the horror/slasher genre, and it is the one film that really rises above the rest, setting a standard that no film that followed has ever matched.
B00007AJF9|4.0|The movie Elizabeth like many other historical movies has the original storyline altered to make it more enjoyable to the viewers. Though much of what had been shown in the movie was not entirely true, it was based purely on facts. The fact that Elizabeth had shown such a small interest in men for most of her reign and had never had a great love story to tell, details about the relationship between her and Robert were embellished to give the movie a more romantic plot. Though much of this movie had strayed from the true information the movie gives a great idea of what Elizabeth went through in the time before and the early parts of her reign. The important facts were all based on what had happened when Elizabeth was queen. The movie was very accurate about what would have gone on during that time, much of what was said and shown usually in the background was an accurate representation of those times. The tower of England was not just something that the creators of this move made up on the spot, it was a real place designed for exactly what they showed it for in the movie. The torture they had shown, and the building style were taken straight out of Elizabeth's reign. The movie Elizabeth though not always true to the story gives a very good idea of what life during Elizabeth's reign would have been like for her.
B000000WHH|5.0|I have been a Culture Club/Boy George fan for years.George O'Dowd (aka Boy George) is one of the best writers of all times and still to this day continues to write beautiful music.This album says alot about his personal life which makes it even better.I will always love this album,and it is their/his best to date.My only problem is Amazon has the date wrong,it was 1983.They should get their information straight.Other than that,this album is a classic for all the Culture Club/Boy George fans!!
B00009V7PJ|3.0|Don't get me wrong this is a great DVD but when compared to her 1st DVD it falls a bit flat for me compared to her 1st DVD for one reason ... less heart little more glitz. Both DVD's have much of the same material and excellant staging with plenty of surprises ... but her 1st DVD seems like she is enjoying every moment and not taking herself so seriously. The person of Cher is caught more deeply and personally in the 1st DVD. It just is fresh and fun. To me beyond her singing and talent for wonderful staging is she is an amazing person and has had a wonderful life story which plays out through her music over a life time. The 1st DVD comes across more genuine and full of a one on one feel and from the heart as well as being a top notch production. I personally think her 1st DVD caught her at her physical and emotional best where the Fare Well Tour DVD seems to be a step down .... but for Cher a step down is still a great performance. So my 2 cents is If you want the person of Cher and all the great staging and most of the same songs check out her 1st DVD over the Fare Well Tour.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|a7x is my fav. band. they have the best guitar i have heard since led zepplin.  The best band and this is there best cd yet.<br />buy it<br />brandon
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is an enjoyable thriller, and includes a number of interesting alternative historical tidbits. Unfortunately, Brown is no Umberto Eco, who could have done much more with the subject matter. The characters are wooden, and the plot depends too much on explication through unrealistic dialogue (including a number of long discussions in dangerous situations). The short chapters punctuated by cliffhangers seem to form a bit of a rhythm after a while. All in all, though, it is a good and interesting read.
B0000931QR|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that I have heard.  I listen to all types of music but if I had to choose one CD, I would pick this one.  Like many others, I listen to this CD everyday.  Amaia's voice is out of this world, and I love the band.  I wish these songs were in English just so people in the U.S.A. would know this great band.  The lyrics are tremendous and well thought out.  I can not wait until the next CD comes out.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|If Jennifer Lopez decided to film her video &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; in Fraggle Rock, we would have had something that looked a lot like Zion. I wish someone could have prepared me for that blow before I saw this movie.<br />Fishburn played &quot;Othello&quot; yet he could not deliver a speech to his doomed people, thankfully the population of Zion had a rave to clear thier minds of his shirtless off key dictatorship-like speech.<br />Neo and Trinity made each other feel aquard for several minutes.<br />Colonel Sanders controls the matrix.<br />Hugo Weaving forgot how to act.<br />That pretty much sums up this movie
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright continues to confound the expectations of the music consumers of the world by producing masterful and brilliant music.  Compare the original and superbly crafted melodies, clever and insightful, often poetic lyrics, mind-bogglingly beautiful arrangements and his unique and gorgeous voice with ANY recently released pop music.  Nothing comes close.  OK, if you're a skate-punk afficianado this won't sit well with you.  Nor would those who groove to the latest beats laid down by 50 Cent care much for this kind of lushly orchestrated &quot;Popera&quot;.  But mainstream music lovers would do well to give this album a fair hearing.  It deserves it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Back in the 70's when I was growing up I listened to singers who were also songwriters, like Jim Croce, Harry Chapin, and James Taylor. Then in the 80's and 90's this genre of singers died out, replaced with the slick sound of songs that were written by producers trying to manufacture a certain sound. Now it seems the singer/songwriter genre is making a comeback with a whole list of performers from John Mayer and Josh Kelley to Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson. I really like this style of alternative-folk rock. Gavin Degraw fits right in to this category. I love his sound and his approach. The whole album is wonderful. I especially liked the track \\"Follow Through\\". I think this song could be a huge radio hit for Gavin. I recommend this album highly, especially to anyone who is a fan of John Mayer or Jason Mraz. I will be listening to this album for a long time to come.
B00005N5RM|4.0|If you're looking for some top-notch acting...this is NOT for you. If you're looking for CGI special effects...this is NOT for you either. If you're looking for a killer script...well, this just may be that \\"killer\\" script you're looking for. What THE BLOB definately does have is some fantastic special effects, great shocking moments and one slimmy-mean BLOB.<br />When THE BLOB captures its prey, it is frightening. Not to mention, creepy and graphic(and I mean it is graphic to the bone). I'm not crazy about some of the clay-mation effects. Thankfully there isn't many of these scenes. Sadly, some of the acting is poor. At times, it just seemed rushed or possibly the director didn't want to shoot some of the scenes over and try to get a better take. However, I'd say there's more \\"good\\" acting then bad. Maybe it's just an '80's thing? What really drew me in was how intense THE BLOB scenes were. There's a very good character build-up and when someone got killed...I felt it. Many kudos for that. I hate it when a horror flick just kicks right in and starts killing people. Those kind of movies have no emotional tie and really all you're doing is watching a blood-fest. If I'm going to watch someone die, there'd better be emotional tie with a purpose! THE BLOB has all the purpose in the world, TO GROW!<br />Not a bad popcorn movie...NOT BAD AT ALL.
B00005OM5L|5.0|I was just able to pick up this DVD and it is incredible!  The sound and picture quality are A-1 (I play it through stereo equipment instead of the TV speakers)  Clapton's playing is STILL the best even after 30 years (he even makes a reference to it being the first time he was back in Hyde Park to perform in 30 years).  I felt like I was there too (I wish!!!)  If you are a Clapton fan grab this one - it won't disappoint!
B00003CXAT|4.0|Steven Spielberg won the Oscar for directing &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and it is as great as any other Big, Serious Movie you'd care to name. But that same year he also directed the pulpy &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; which, for reasons of its own, was just as special as his angry and deeply personal Holocaust masterwork.<br />Here is a special effects movie that, like &quot;Terminator 2&quot; before it, heralded a new era of filmmaking. True, both movies announced the arrival of a lot of bad cinema (&quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; anyone?), but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is memorable because of the love and care its director lavished on his beasties. This is sci-fi adventure escapism at its best.<br />The story is not terribly strong, more like a clothesline on which to hang some of the most exciting action scenes ever devised. The movie isn't as elaborate as Michael Crichton's book, but it's just as fast-paced and handles its resurrected dinosaurs with equal awe. Did Spielberg dumb-down some of Crichton's more difficult scientific concepts? You betcha, but you know what? I've seen worse.<br />I will always admire this movie for the T-Rex sequence, which scared me so badly in the theater that I had to pony up three more times to take the ride again. What a great moment; it sort of makes me imagine what it must have been like to have seen the premiere of &quot;King Kong&quot; back in 1933, because &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; garners comparison.<br />The velociraptors were also great villains, photographed in menacing fashion and given distinct personalities of their own. The final scene, which brings together the T-Rex and the raptors, is a fast, brutal classic that leaves you wanting more. Wisely, Spielberg gives us just enough.<br />The acting isn't great, but it is efficient. I give high marks to Jeff Goldblum for his flashy portrayal of chaotician Ian Malcolm (is he trying to channel Bono?) and Sam Neill, for his Harrison Ford-like turn as Dr. Grant. Laura Dern grates a nerve, and Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond as if he were Santa Claus, but these are flaws I'm willing to overlook.
B0000032LS|5.0|i am thrilled to report(memories like the 'cobwebs' of my mind), that i was in the audience for the official opening of \\"RHPS\\"in 1975...and i like everyone else became instantly intoxicated and obessesed with frank and his denizens. the power the film had over a generation, via its imagery, symbolism, characters and their talent could be likened to releasing invisible heroin into the atomosphere at regular intervals keeping us in a constant state of euphoric submission. i think its absolutely redundant to review this recording. it is however, etched into our cultures psyche  and has opened doors for the depraved, the not so depraved,the gay, bi, lesbian, transed out, geeky, s&m'd, stifled, frigid, barren, openminded andclosed, worn in, worn out, fresh, nubile, old, young, smart, slow, you name it.... peoples, of every walk of life and much, much more;futher confirming the power the entertainment industries have to influence. i  saw the stage production at the roxy only once, albeit after tim curry left. in his stead was the wonderful and extremely competent paul jabara who unfortunately died way too soon. he was also responsible for penning some very famous pop tunes including \\"last dance,\\" and \\"enough is enough.\\" the stage production and its soundtrack primed me for the forthcoming film. i remember the build up..the hype..which can often leave one disappointed. the film in this case was rare in that it FAR EXCEEDED everyones expectations. because the film is what i identify(ied) with so much, the soundtrack has a VERYsoft spot in my heart.  i did have to adust to the slowing down of the songs, but only for a very brief period. they simply took what was great and made it greater...perfection! if you're reading this, chances are youre already a fan. if you're new to RHPS then please, do yourself the biggest favor and GET IT! you will join ranks and be a part of a massive cult following that believe it or not, continues to grow. rock on!
B00003CXB4|5.0|You got your &quot;Toy Story.&quot; You got your &quot;Finding Nemo.&quot; You got your &quot;Shrek.&quot; You got your &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; Those are all great animated family films. You've got &quot;Aladdin,&quot; &quot;Snow White,&quot; &quot;Bambi,&quot; &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio.&quot; But &quot;The Lion King,&quot; in my opinion, is the greatest of all.<br />I have loved this movie for going on 10 years now, and I'm not even a fan of Elton John. It's my equivalent of &quot;Bambi,&quot; a Disney cartoon I didn't exactly grow up with. &quot;The Lion King&quot; proceeds along similar lines and serves much the same purpose: to show kids maybe a darker side of life, to inspire thought and conversation on a level that is elevated above Robin Williams' antics as the Genie. Here is an edgy, intelligent, grown-up cartoon that, yes, children can and do enjoy.<br />I got to experience this movie &quot;through the eyes&quot; of my daughter, and it's a film that has stayed with me ever since. The DVD release is much appreciated -- it has been a long wait. I am happy to report that the original theatrical version of the film looks absolutely spectacular on DVD. The colors are sharper and clearer, the picture is obviously much sharper, the sound quality has been vastly improved ... it's a glorious viewing experience. And the director/producer commentary track is insightful and entertaining. I haven't pored over the additional materials on the set, but I bought the DVD for the movie itself, and on that level alone, I am pleased.<br />For me, &quot;The Lion King&quot; is one of the greatest examples of cinematic storytelling ever made. And what a story, the archetypal representation of the classic hero (Simba) who, through trial and tribulation, finds redemption and atonement after suffering much guilt over the death of his father. Kids can enjoy the music, the humor, the vivid cartoon characters and the action, but I think the symbolic imageryof this film is what affects so many adults. If you think it was an accident that the movie plays like a cross between &quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Hamlet,&quot; you're wrong -- the filmmakers very much knew what they were doing.<br />Aside from all that, you can't beat &quot;The Lion King&quot; for sheer entertainment. Ten years later, it's still the best. The characters are still lovable, imaginative and captivating. The sets and special effects are still awesome. The wildebeast stampede is still thrilling. The death of Mufasa is still terribly sad. &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; is still hilarious. Scar is still a terrifying and repulsive villain. Nathan Lane's performance as Timon is still a comedy classic. The dialogue still rings true. And so forth and so on. Talk about a movie that hasn't aged a day.<br />(Well ... ok. I'm not a big fan of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight.&quot; Hey, nothing's perfect.)<br />&quot;The Lion King&quot; deserved at the very least an Oscar nomination for Best Picture -- hands down, for my money, it's better than &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; which I admit is a terrific movie. People who think this movie is &quot;too violent&quot; or &quot;not for kids&quot; should rethink their position. This movie is for everyone, precisely because it challenges our notion of what &quot;should&quot; and &quot;shouldn't&quot; be in a cartoon.<br />Long story short: this is the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of animated films. Now, go forth, and enjoy the DVD.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I'm not a pop fan at all. My music is hard and dark. But after seeing the music video for All the Things She Said (Which is great and the song is the best), I went out and bought the album. After listening to the songs only once I knew it was a new favorite of mine. The music is catchy, the songs stick, and the message is clear.<BR>The only problem I had with this CD is that there are really only 8 songs. They are all short, but they all are good.<BR>Don't be turned off by the lesbian thing (which, guys, if you are... there is somthing wrong...). Go out and get the album!
B00003CWL6|4.0|I used to have arguments with people at work over whether \\"American Beauty\\" is a movie primarily for guys. It is told, after all, strictly from a man's perspective -- Lester Burnham's, namely, since after all, he is dead and presumably all knowing. Maybe that is why Caroline Burnham is portrayed as such a shrew, and why virtually everyone else in the picture is viewed with such cold-hearted negativity -- including the children. That is how Lester experienced them, or imagined himself experiencing them. So, from his rather narrow point of view, the portrayals do make sense.<br />Such arguments are irrelevent, but they do make a point: \\"American Beauty\\" is a film you can't help but talk about and play over and over in your mind. For a while there back in 1999, I had the dazzling idea that movies were going to actually get better ... only to see an endless supply of greedy sequels pile into the multiplexes, making a film like \\"American Beauty\\" all the more rare and, well, beautiful.<br />People who complain about the movie's subject matter, about its language and sexuality, who actually walked out of the theater ... well, all I can say is, they should figure out in advance what a movie is about and decide beforehand whether it's something they want to pay to see. The only movie I ever walked out of was \\"Battlefield Earth,\\" and only because it was stupid to the point of mental paralysis. \\"American Beauty\\" may make you angry, but it is not stupid, or dirty, or vulgar. That some people found it shocking may say more about them than about the quality of the movie.<br />First and foremost, \\"American Beauty\\" is a comedy, and one of the blackest since, I dunno, \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" or maybe \\"MASH.\\" It is like a television sitcom pushed to the edge of nightmare, with the classical sitcom \\"dad\\" (Kevin Spacey) waking up to a new life and realizing that he's surrounded not just by boring, uninteresting people, but crazy, selfish, materialistic people. He realizes he doesn't reallyknow his wife and that they should rekindle what they had before Grown Up Life intruded. He realizes he hasn't been communicating with his self-absorbed daughter, and that although he should do something about it, he doesn't quite know what. He realizes he had a lot more fun when he was a kid. He realizes his job sucks. And he realizes that he is, indeed, a sexual creature, though the object of his obsession (Mena Suvari, wonderful) makes him more of a pervert than a stud.<br />The movie is a dark, nighttime journey through Lester's mind, and though it expands to include the next-door neighbors and their troubled lives, it is truly limited to his perspective and is, in fact, about him and no one else. Yeah, his activities border on criminal, and no, you shouldn't really mix weight-lifting with dope smoking and beer guzzling, but he's burning off 20 wasted years, and he does finally come around at the end.<br />The supremely shocking thing is that Lester meets his ultimate fate just at the moment that he realizes life maybe ain't so bad, after all. He's robbed of his life just when he learns to appreciate it. How else to describe it, but as a cosmic jest at Lester's expense?<br />The movie is excellent on every level, from the tremendous performances to the fantastic screenplay to Sam Mendes' atmospheric direction. It is by turns hilariously funny and somberly dramatic. It is unpredictable and insightful about the way Americans live, a quality I cherish above any CGI effect you can imagine. That it is just a little cold, just a little austere, and just a little too pessimistic, is a flaw I'm willing to live with because othewise there is so much much to enjoy here. Was it honestly the best picture of a great year at the movies, a year that saw the release of \\"Magnolia,\\" \\"The Green Mile,\\" \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and \\"Fight Club\\"? Yeah. It was.
B00005RIZP|3.0|For its time, Black Christmas would have been a highly original and frightening experience. This 1974 slasher film was indeed quite creepy, but I found some scenes were always going on forever. Olivia Hussey's performance was fair, but it was Margot Kidder who brought this film a very high quality. The unknown killer is very disturbing, always saying his name is Billy and calling out for a person named Agnes. Overall, this film was pretty scary, but even if it was the first of its kind, it wasn't the best film ever made. Pretty good I guess.
0783225849|5.0|Black &amp; White photography at its best! Way, way ahead of its time. Thank you Hitch.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is a great find!  I have been waiting so long to hear music that doesn't sound like everything else that has been packaged and printed and sold to a generation, that doesn't know a decent quality CD if it were right at their feet.  Evanescence created Fallen, 2003's most ingenious creation the music world has never seen.  Guitarist Ben Moody's heavy, hard-rock driven riffs like &quot;Going Under,&quot; Bring Me To Life,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Tourniquet.&quot;  And great drumming in &quot;Haunting&quot; and &quot;Whisper.&quot;  Along with great lyrics to complete the ballads and emotional songs like &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Hello,&quot; and &quot;Imaginary.&quot;<BR>The music is unforgetable and lyrics are cleverly crafted, all and all Evanescence are a force to be reckoned with.  The songs &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;  will leave you with chills, not to mention, amazed  with the talent that singer, Amy Lee possesses.  The CD goes from hard-rock to soft ballads to gothic to a sound never heard of.  What genre would they be put in?  I have no idea, they're a world apart from anything I've heard.  My recommendation, get the CD, you'll never get tired out it.  With each round you'll hear something new, whether it be an interesting guitar riff, or intriguing background vocals.  It is a must have in any collection.
B00003CXI0|5.0|It's funny, magical. Brings you to the world of magic.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I have to admit that there were'nt too many scares in this flick but it was still very entertaining. Some people compare Identity to Memento, an over-praised train wreck of a movie in my opinion. Don't be scared away by this comparison, Identity is a fine movie. <br />   A great cast, including John Cusack and Ray Liotta, is brought together to a lonely desert motel during a bad storm, or so it seems. The whole concept behind this movie is not new, but the interpretation and the execution of that concept is very original. The film's final revelations are, to me, the best parts of Identity.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. I saw it many times. I never got tired of it. Great movie and the book is good too.
0064407667|5.0|Other reviewers have questioned the suitability of this book for young readers; the purpose of my review is to offer an alternative opinion to those who think it unsuitable.  Most of the adults are portrayed in these books as villainous or insensitive, though there are exceptions (eg. Justice Strauss in the first book).  And this indeed is the crucial point: it is the children, by themselves, who are the heroes of these books.  The author taps into the too-frequent reality of the world, which is that many children are often stuck in unfortunate situations, at the hands of cruel or simply uncaring adults (a very Dickensian motif).  If the reader desires to find a moral in the story, let it be that children are truly resouceful, and their individuality and perceptiveness often overlooked by condenscending adults. It is the author's refusal to sugar-coat reality that makes these books truly valuable for young readers; for, in the end (though the endings are not overtly \\"happy\\") the children do inevitably avert the looming catastrophe.  It is true that these books are dark, but not unnecessarily so.
B00008BRBG|4.0|The Police hit the music scene in 1978 with their debut album.  At first they were dubbed as a punk rock band but in truth the trio was much more than a bunch of Clash/ Sex Pistol wannabes.  Each member of the Police had musical roots that reached into reggae and jazz  as well as rock.  The Police embraced the punk rock image, knowing it would be the only way they'd be recognized in England.  Here they are just a high energy band looking for success rather than the new wave philosphers they'd be later on.<br />In the midst of Britain's punk fever, The Police did a very smart thing by placing NEXT TO YOU as the opener.  It was a clear punk rock track and not a band opener either.  This is certainly not where The Police shine on this album though.  They're fusion of reggae rock is displayed wonderfully on SO LONELY, CAN'T STAND LOSING YOU and ROXANNE which is clear why they became the album's hits.  These hits certainly do not overshadow the rest of the album though.  Tracks like the rockin' TRUTH HITS EVERYBODY and PEANUTS are both awesome.  Some of the album tracks do not stand up as well though.  HOLE IN MY LIFE and BORN IN THE 50's are somewhat inane and draggy while BE MY GIRL - SALLY, and MASOKO TANGA are just plain weird.  However none of these tracks are completely unlistenable and that makes the Police's debut album a solid record.  <br />Overall Outlandos d'Amour is a great debut album and not a bad start for the Police.  A group who was trying to escape the shackles of punk rock music.  While it's not their best it's still an essential CD to own of theirs.  Highly recommended.
B00000IAU3|5.0|The instrumentals on this cd were amazing and Dido's voice is amazing. I like just about every song except for two. Here  with Me is just the best and Thank You is forever good despite the fact that it got a little too much radio play. Defintely one of the best cd's ever.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Hi. <BR>This movie basically was a letdown that begun the downward spiral that was the summer of 2003. Finding Nemo, the Pixar family film won out the box office and viewer's hearts rather than the forseeen meglomaniacal drive this film was supposed to have.<BR>As deep and as apparently lovingly made, this film lacked heart. As Entertainment Weekly recently commented, 'Becoming is more entertaining than bieng', and that's very much apparent in The Matrix Reloaded. <BR>Main characters usually are vehicles for the audience to travel with, to discover and learn with..and eventually, grow with. Neo, the film's main character, was as approachable as a wet towelette and as enthused with his job just as much.<BR>He was The One, and as we learn, he's the One of the Ones as well.. (there had been six 'Ones' before, and alll failed because they didn't know love...or something.)<BR>That's why THIS One is apparently supposed to win in the next film.<br />I really don't have much to gripe about with this film other than the fact that it had as much heart as a Star Trek episode (the characters didn't grow..they just did what the had to do...blah!) and the nearly ten minute Kahula Iced drink ad that annoyed me and everyone else to no end.<BR>If you get this dvd, i'm assuming they have a 'SCENE MISSING' section when this horrible Christina Aguliera video pops on.. if not, it's a waste of technology.
B000089RVR|4.0|I just bought Life for Rent today it was 15 bucks but I don't regret it at all.This cd is really good, I mean every song on this cd is not excellent,but there is no such thing as a bad Dido song. Dido has a beautiful voice it's addictive, you just want to hear it over and over again.If I could give it 4and a half stars I would. Oh I love White Flag it's just as good as Thank You, great instrumentals.Not a dissapointment for Dido fans.Buy Life 4 Rent!
B00005V9HH|5.0|could i love this movie any more? it is told in such a way that no matter how many times i watch it, the suprise still gives me goose bumps.
7119005901|4.0|First off, I'd like to say I do enjoy this book and the history behind it.  I am a history major and plan on being a novelist someday, writing ancient historical-like novels.  Thus this, and several other books, are prime for my reading list... but as a general novel I found this book lacking.  This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing.  Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max.  There aren't any vivid descriptions of anything.  I'm not someone who needs two pages describing a flower (the worst case of long unnecessary description I've come across), but I would like to know what a character looks like more than just his height, or what a building or city looks like.  Surely major battles involving thousands shouldn't start and finish in one or two pages.  I suppose that this story could have been twice as long had he allowed descriptions, but I would have enjoyed it a bit more.
B0000BWVBD|4.0|I read comics before when I was little and I remembered that the Hulk is supposed to save people, but not kill them. I like the scene when he jumps from a far distance, that would be my airplane ticket in case I get stuck in the airport. I like Spiderman the most because it shows Spiderman more, which the character is already turning into Spiderman. That is pretty cool because that has been in the comic book before. These producers are getting images from the comic books to put them in movies, just to see how it really was from the comic books. I read comic books and never understood the action. So, I bought Spiderman and the Hulk for the real action. What is missing from Spiderman is Shocker and the rest of the bad guys. X-Men are the same way, which I know every character in the group. I wonder if they are going to remake Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles again. It would be a cool movie to see them back in action. The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Superman should also make a comeback.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I got hooked into buying this cd because I just fell in love with the little pieces of &quot;Follow Through&quot; that were being played to promote the new Jerry Bruckheimer series, &quot;Skin&quot;. Even though I am always hesitant of buying a cd for one song, I am ever so glad that I did. Gavin Degraw is about to explode onto the musical forefront and rightfully so. This is what I have been missing in the newer John Mayer music
B00005JLH2|5.0|In this movie, my eyes were mainly upon Nick Cannon than the rest of the movie, which his character is cool in this movie. It makes you think what a marching band does when they're in college rather than in high school. I wish my school band was more like that in the movie, but I think that's so impossible. Nick Cannon is the admirer mostly in this movie. When he finally cuts his hair off, he is much cuter. Drumline is a moving movie that will make you dance with the band! I do that when I watch football.
B00004RGUI|5.0|You can use this CD while you are reading or relaxing, it will help more to relax if you release your mind and listen to it in an open area.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love this cd when I bought it. My favorite songs are &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; with Jay-Z, that was a comeback when Jay-Z did a song with Beyonce. The other song I liked was &quot;Baby Boy&quot; with Sean Paul, they are talented together. I seen the music video, and I wanted to say &quot;You go girl&quot; to Beyonce. I recommend if anybody that likes hip-hop or R&amp;B buy this cd! I bought it to get my groove on.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This is a great soundtrack, almost all of the great songs from the movie, including the original songs. Great mix of genres too. And as an added bonus the soundtrack is Enhanced for computers, it includes all the full trailers for the movie. Does any one know what the song in Trailer 3 (KB3) is called? The only complaint I have with the soundtrack is that Ode to Oren should be instrumental.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step follow's up Mer De Noms and takes the band in a new direction. Where as the last album had more concise, guitar laden rock songs, the new one is atmospheric and moody. There are less hit singles here, but more of the quality music one comes to expect from Howerdell, Keenan and the gang. <br />&quot;The Package&quot; opens the album well, if on a long note, clocking in at 7:40. &quot;Crimes&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; serve more as interludes than entire songs.  There are still the occasional knock out songs. &quot;The Noose&quot; is this album's &quot;Orestes,&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; rocks as hard as anything on MDN. But on the whole, the album blends together more, which depending on how you look at either binds the songs into an album, or causes them to lose their identity. <br />Either way, this album is beautiful. &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot; are amazing, and the cover &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is surprisingly well done. This album is a pretty big departure from songs like &quot;The Hollow,&quot; closer to something like &quot;Brena,&quot; that moody feel. A great second album, I can't wait to see what else is in store from APC.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I am dumbfounded at the Terminator fan who will dismiss this movie based solely upon the absence of James Cameron in the director's chair. It seems many Cameron diehards conditioned themselves not to like this film ages before entering the theatre. Mostow has taken Terminator in a new direction while poying homage to the previous films without forgetting to throw some humor in the mix. No, this movie did not reveal any universal truths to mankind, but what movie does? Terminator 3 shows where Matrix Reloaded tells, keeps far better pacing and has arguably the best effects in an action film - ever.
0739302043|5.0|An eternal secret has to be learned for that its keepers are being systematically murdered by sacred forces. The last of those murdered, a prominent curator at the Louvre, decides to set a French cryptographer (his granddaughter to whom he never spoke in 10 years) and an American symbologist on a journey that, granting their skills, would eventually lead them to the knowledge of that 2000-year-old secret. The sacred forces learn about the late curator's plan and decide to join in on the hunt for the most controversial secret of all time.<br />This has got to be the best thriller I have read! I completely enjoyed the vast amount of religious and aesthetic information provided throughout the book. Sometimes it feels that all of this could be true, but then you realize that this is a work of fiction! I love religious novels and this one hit the spot.<br />I am impressed with the writing style, character and suspense development. The secret brotherhood, the Holy Grail, the Church's secrets and dark history and the very concept of divinity are but a taste of what this novel offers its readers. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys religious thrillers and thought-provoking stories about Christ and his legacy.<br />This is definitely one novel I will reread time and again. It's that riveting!

6305428042|5.0|This movie is by far one of my all-time favorites! I have been a huge fan of it since it first came out in 1993. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy played their best in the movie and if I could use 10 stars, I would. Everyone should buy it if they don't already have it!
B00005NKKV|3.0|When &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; came out as a single in late 1965, I was already becoming a thirteen year old devotee of folk-rock--the Byrds, the newly gone electric Dylan.  It somehow took hold of my adolescent brain.  The lyrics seemed intelligent and poetic, and the Beatles themselves had taken a few cues from Dylan and had started penning &quot;meaningful&quot; lyrics.<br />Into this mix came two sensitive NYC boys with &quot;funny&quot; names. I remember thinking that like most duos of the era--Peter and Gordon, Chad and Jeremy, Sonny and Cher--that &quot;Simon&quot; and &quot;Garfunkel&quot; were their FIRST names.  Oh, well, what do you really know when you're thirteen?  I also thought that &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; must surely be a masterpiece.  And when my college aged brother used to stick his head in my room when I was playing it and say, &quot;What a stupid song!  'Sounds of silence'! That doesn't mean anything.&quot;   Sigh! If only I had the vocabulary then to say, &quot;It's an oxymoron, you moron.&quot;  (He was no dummy actually, he probably knew that and was just trying to get my goat.)<br />A few years later, I was past Simon and Garfunkel and into more avant-gardesy kind of stuff like the Velvet Underground.  I started to believe that &quot;poetic&quot; songs like &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; were pretty darn pretentious and sophomoric, after all. Sort of like the poetry my friends and I were all writing at the time (yes, we knew it was bad, but we weren't commiting it to vinyl either).<br />Of course, Paul Simon was all of 21 or 22 (maybe younger) when he penned these songs.  I should have been more generous.  I mean, look at that cover shot--just a couple of kids! Besides, melodically, the songs all held up.  And despite its pretentions, &quot;Silence&quot; still holds a spell over me that almost no other Simon composition does to this day.  Something about that misterioso inserted bassline, the &quot;neon lights&quot; and &quot;peopletalking without speaking&quot;--very science-fiction, even if it wasn't meant to be.<br />The song &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; was probably about as Dylanesque as Paul Simon ever got lyrically.  The imagery of an &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; or &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; (not included here) never got so deliciously contorted, the conceits behind those songs much more obvious.  &quot;Blessed&quot; tries for a folk rock toughness a la Dylan circa '65 and does an OK job of it, but already Simon's strong suit was turning out to be narrative songs (&quot;Most Peculiar Man&quot;) and richly textured love songs like &quot;Kathy's Song.&quot; All in all, much more straightforward stuff than the title song.  <br />Listening to it now, some 38 years later, it seems pretty clear that Paul Simon was off to a darn good start.  Now the question arises, am I turning out to be enough of a fan to take in their reunion concert at those outrageous prices I've been hearing about.  Landsakes...
B00004XMS0|5.0|Now,I don't have this set sadly,but I own all four movies.The first film,Batman,is a terrific movie directed by Tim Burton and starring Kim Basinger,Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton.The film won a Oscar for production design.The second best of the series.<BR>The second film,Batman Returns,is also the darkest of the films.Tim Burton direct this one as well.Michael Keaton returns as Batman and does an even better job than he did in the first one.Christopher Walken,Michell Pfeifier,and Danny Devito costar in a film that is not as good as the first one,but is still pretty enjoyable.The worst of the series,but still enjoyable.<BR>The Third Film ,Batman Forever, is lighter than the other two.In this one,Val kilmer plays Batman and is even better than Keaton,in my opinion.This time,Batman must battle the combined forces of the Riddler(an ohilarious Jim Carrey)and Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones)while trying to have a romatic relationship with Dr. Chase Meridan(NIcole Kidman).Robin also comes in this one and is played by Chris o'Donnel.The best of the films.<BR>The fourth,Batman and Robin,may disapoint you,but it's still enjoyable.Mr.Freeze(Arnold Schwarzennegger),Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman),and Bane(Jeep Swenson),who combine forces to stop Batman and Robin.Batgirl also is in this in this one and is played by Alica Silverstone.This movie has amazing visual effects and action scenes.The third best of the series.<BR>I hope my review help you.See these films if you you are a fan of Batman.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Hot from years of clubbing in Austin (although he, like brother Jimmie, grew up in the funky Oak Cliff section of Dallas), Stevie Ray Vaughan and his first album Texas Flood poured onto the national blues scene in 1983 like a Mississippi dam burst. Blues had been morphing into hard rock in the previous decade, due in no small part to the efforts of Savoy Brown, Humble Pie, Cream, and most important of all, Led Zeppelin. Stevie shook the music industry to it's foundations by playing blues rock faster, louder, deeper, and with more soul than anyone had played it in decades. &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot; features ultraquick, barbed-wire guitar runs that set the table for the feast to follow. &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; features one of Stevie's most blazing riffs ever and is such a good song that he revamped it and got a second number out of it, &quot;I'm Crying.&quot; Fantastic!  Of the instrumentals: &quot;Testify&quot; is fast and tasty, &quot;Rude Mode&quot; is twice as fast and just as tasty. Stevie also invents a new type of number with &quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot;, turning the children's rhyme into a blues school fable equal to the classic &quot;Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl.&quot;  (For good measure, he even changes the color of the fleece in the live bonus cut from &quot;white as snow&quot; to &quot;black as coal&quot;.) &quot;Lenny&quot; and bonus cut &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; (which Stevie would recut and use for his second album Couldn't Stand The Weather), are 3AM songs, perfect for playing in the early morning hours when you're trying to decide whether to open another bottle or go to bed. Bassist Tommy Shannon (previously with another great Texas guitarist, Johnny Winter) and Drummer Chris Layton shine throughout, content to provide solid support rather than flash and noise. Finally, there is a Stevie Ray interview snippet, in which he explains that his guitar mastery comes from playing from the heart and not the mind. (Endless hours of practice helps, too.) Be sure and add Texas Flood to your collection today. It will truly be your Pride and Joy.
B00006F7S4|2.0|It's a mood piece, people. Slow, heartbroken, and consistently so. Depending on what you're into, this could be a blessing or a no-no. Personally, I once thought this album was near-flawless. Beck manages to co-create 12 songs of pure melancholia without ever being melodramatic. But its consistency as a down-troddden record becomes a major flaw after several listens (i.e. repetitious). When your mood changes from sadness to cheerfulness... do you still indulge in the gloom, or move on to sunnier pop songs?
B00003CXD5|5.0|One customer review gave this DVD a mere four stars, calling it &quot;visually abbreviated&quot; because it isn't in widescreen.<br />There was no such thing as widescreen prior to 1953. ALL films made before then were filmed with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (aka 4:3), the same as television. In fact, the size of your television screen was taken from the standard format defined by Hollywood.<br />In 1953, &quot;The Robe&quot; became the first picture released in Cinemascope. This is considered the birth of widescreen. &quot;The Robe&quot; was a huge popular success. (It is true that there were some widescreen films prior to &quot;The Robe,&quot; but the number of these films was extremely small and required theatres to use special equipment.)<br />You can get all the the gory details at the Widescreen Museum: [...]<br />This DVD of &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; is not &quot;visually abbreviated&quot; in any way. There is nothing to abbreviate.<br />So don't go looking for widescreen versions of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; or &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;
B0000AI44Q|3.0|Take it from a Neil Young fanatic who can maintain some objectivity-- &quot;Greendale&quot; is not the 5 star classic that most reviewers here would have you believe it is.  Neil &amp; Crazy Horse are well deserving of their rock-legend status.  Neil has accomplished what few of his famous contemporaries have managed to do: write classic songs and albums well into the 1990s.  For instance, can you think of any Stones or Floyd albums that rival Crazy Horse's latter-day output (Sleeps With Angels, Mirror Ball, and Broken Arrow come to mind).  The fact of the matter is, Neil stayed vital long after his &quot;prime&quot;... until 2001's Are You Passionate.  Coming after a 4-odd year hiatus, sour milk would have been more refreshing to my palate.<br />Now Greendale is being critically haled as Neil's second-coming (though in ol' Shakey's case we're up to about his ninth).  On Amazon.com in particular you'll hear the kind of rave-reviews that'll give you the impression that this is a of sorts sequel to Ragged Glory.  Come to think of it, perhaps that's so: both guitar-drenched epics have been labeled &quot;comeback albums&quot;, both feature marathon-length tributes to &quot;mother earth&quot;, and both are unashamedly overrated.  You see, after Neil's late '90s-early '00s drought, fans CRAVED a comeback album, and in the wake of a nationwide tour promoting Greendale and in the absence of a more substantive song cycle, they have settled for this.<br />Whether it's due to the absence of Poncho or a lack of fire on Neil's part, Greendale features some of the Horse's most meandering and, that's right, BORING instrumentals to date. Nevermind the cheesy environmentally-aware lyrics (who wrote &quot;Be The Rain&quot; anyway, Captain Planet?), which any long time Neil fan has come to accept and perhaps even get a kick out of.  The undeniable problem with Greendale is the music itself: be they uninspired (Leave the Driving), unending (Carmichael), or simply redundant (Grandpa's Interview, which sounds nothing like &quot;Don't Cry No Tears&quot; as one reviewer here wrote), the instrumental passages here simply don't hold up to old standards (&quot;Change Your Mind&quot;, &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot;) or repeat listens.<br />But not all is hopeless here.  You still have Bandit, Grandpa's Interview, Falling From Above, and Double E in particular (who can deny the &quot;livin in the summer of love&quot; chorus?) to add to the classic Neil Young cannon.  I realize that ultimately it's all subjective, but believe a rabid Horse fan when I tell you that the idealistic hippy-dream Greendale theme is what's earning all the 5 star reviews here-- not the album itself.  Those looking for a real blast of Neil 'n roll should pick up Zuma, Rust, or Life instead.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Stunning says it all. Between the restoration, the impeccable transfer to digital and the experience of watching it on my new widescreen in progressive scan, I can't say enough about the majesty of this picture. Both my wife and I felt it was like seeing the movie for the first time. The new song adds little (but doesn't detract), the extra features are nice and the special home theatre mix is great if you're listening in surround (which you should be). But it's the movie's visual impact-combined with the still great story-that makes this a must-have DVD. Now where's Aladdin?
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is definately the best CD ever created. Every song is short but sweet. They are very rich and complex which is rare for a debut album. Another aspect is that it includes absolutely no swears so teen's parents are all set. I'd have to rate every song out of this CD a 10+ because of the mix of rich vocals, powerful guitar riffs, and original ideas without using the f word at all! I'm listening to it right now.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|So it was the music that sustained me throughout the horror. I'm squeamish at the sight of blood, and if you've seen the film, you know that's not a good thing to be for these two hours. Since I had my eyes closed, my listening was in super-tune, and the music was fantastic! A great compilation, and a definite &quot;noteworthy&quot; addition to your collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm as critical as anyone when it comes to music. But at the same time, I can't help get wholly immersed in an absolute work of art -- when I can find one. Accepting Radiohead's monumental status in contemporary music is a no-brainer. Discussion as to which of their albums, if pressed to make a choice, stands at the top is as reflective of the range of listeners as the breadth of the band's playing styles. Put a gun to my head and I'll tell you Amnesiac is the jewel amongst jewels. Moving from ethereal to hypnotic to gut-wrenching then rebounding with a pumping beat, it's all here. To those who label Amnesiac as left-overs from Kid A warmed-over just don't get it. I've been around the band since Pablo Honey and I met just about every subsequent album with initial disdain. Allowed the time and open-mindedness each release deserved, whole worlds of artistic expression presented themselves. This music's not for casual listeners. Thank God. Live with it, learn to love it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Previously, while browsing through the reviews, I noticed a common theme in the suprising amount of negative responses this album has gotten.  The reviewers who wrote them seemed for some reason angry at the fact that so many people enjoy this album.  I was appalled by the number of people who seemed to have no respect for other people's opinions.  The thought that all the people are &quot;just faking&quot; liking the album to seem cool and hip is just absurd.  They seem to be infuriated that many people seem to genuinly like something that they do not, and failing to realize that opinions are subjective, are drawn to the rash conclusion that everyone else is wrong, stupid, or &quot;faking it&quot;.  These people need to realize that it is ok not to like an album that many other people like.  Please don't critisize others for their opinions, even if they differ from your own, for it is the exact nature of our free will that allows us to have differing thoughts and feelings when interpreting art, or anything for that matter.  Without this gift, we would be nothing but mindless robots, without the freedom of choice or individual thought.<br />That being said, OK Computer is one of my favorite albums.  Each track on the album has the ability of conjering up different emotions, and by the end, the emotional wirlwind leaves me dizzy.  The album's central theme of encountering genuin beauty in our world of technology, yet being unable to shake a certain feeling of unease, comes across perfectly.  It's funny that the people who are angered by this album may be the people it was really geared towards.  It attempts to send the message that you don't have to be compliant all the time: treasure your individuality, don't let anyone take it away from you.  At least that's what I got from this album, which brings the point across beautifully with it's layered sounds and melodic, peircing, and haunting vocals.  I'm genuinly moved by this album everytime I listen to it.  For thosethat think I'm saying this just to be hip, and cannnot and do not want anyone to have opinions different than their own, I'm with Tom Yorke in saying &quot;We hope that you Choke.&quot;
B000002VEP|5.0|I have never really cared for musical categories myself; I know what I like and that's what counts ! I don't care if this is &quot;conceptual prog rock&quot; or &quot;anthemic/dramatic rock&quot;---It's just awesome music (and it rocks) ! Not even Meatloaf music writer Jim Steinman has anything over these guys from the APP...<br />Alan Parsons and crew take the listener on quite a journey with this production. I have to say that it is one of the better &quot;updated&quot; projects (though many will argue that his first 3 albums from the 70's were the pinnacle or real classics---and they are, but for that era). Though Gaudi was released in the late 80's and may have that 80's rock sound, it still holds up so damn well in 2003. All vocals are strong and powerful and only convey that much more of a musical force for the theme of the album. It's also an ingenious touch to add the soothing sound of a wailing saxophone in some tracks without turning the whole event into mush muzak; it works very well indeed! In whole, got the impression I was in Barcelona, Spain on an actual tour of Gaudi's Cathedral !
B00002MZ4W|5.0|In a world of Britney Spears-wannabes and superficial boy-bands bouncing all over the radio, it's refreshing to hear Fiona Apple. She doesn't try to create the &quot;bad girl&quot; image like Spears, but she has her own intellect. With every song on this album, her voice enraptures you with its soulfulness and sexiness. My favorite songs are &quot;Paper Bad&quot;, &quot;Get Gone&quot;, and &quot;I Know&quot;. my recommendation: buy this CD if you want a singer who has an excellent voice combined with heartfelt, poetic lyrics. 10/10
B00005QB9A|5.0|This Tornatore venture virtually oozes four decades of atmosphere and is beautifully embellished by punctiliously detailed sets, costumes, and threaded with lush musical themes. The life of a child abandoned on an ocean liner at the turn of the century(&quot;1900&quot; played by Tim Roth),is recounted in the present and flashbacks by his friend Max(Pruitt Taylor Vince),an aging, down-on-his-luck trumpeter,to a pawn shop proprietor (Peter Vaughan).<br />1900's prodigious musical talents are displayed many times, but three instances are outstanding for their humor, drama and melancholy, respectively: the piano &quot;duel&quot; between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton(Clarence Williams III); the rhapsodic pathos of a love theme as 1900 records a wax matrix while absorbed in the angelic face of a young woman outside his window(M&eacute;lanie Thierry), soon to be lost in a crowd leaving the ship--and him--behind; the brightly lilting tune he plays as the brakeless piano rolls about the ballroom in a turbulent sea with Max at his side.<br />To refer to this story as mere character development understates its value. 1900 symbolizes a man, never having left the confines of the ship, who lives in a defined, finite world and who,though the piano finds infinitude in his imagination and music. Ultimately,however,he must confront the inevitable: to leave the ship for the seeming boundlessness of dry land or die in a state of non-existence. There is no record of his birth and only one recording of his work.<br />Roth's subtle skills are brought to the fore in 1900' sometimes brilliant,sometimes naive--and always irreverant--character.<br />&quot;Legend&quot; is fresh and challenging,admixing philosophy and fable into myth. After four viewings, there is always an overlooked detail,expression,or nuance missed previously.I may be satisfied after four more.

B0000648WZ|4.0|The book is much better and the books emphasis on the value of military/volunteer service is complete left out of the film.  However, even if you read the book first, this is still worth your time.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Only someone like Joss Whedon can come up with the crazy idea of making a musical and succeeding. Once More With Feeling is an amazing episode and CD. All the songs have so much meaning and the cast put so much emotions into it and made it one amazing piece that I can listen to over and over again...SMG's voice fits her character and her songs are great (Going Through The Motions, Walk Through The Fire, Life's A Show)  Emma Caulfield's theatrical voice is true and just says ANYA, and the obvious ones Anthony and Amber who just sound amazing together ....and of course the all powerful group sing &quot;Where Do We go From Here&quot; that shows the lonliness and fear  in the characters and takes us to the next level with Buffy and Spike. This is a great CD if you're a Buffy fan!! and If you're not you should get it anyway!!! Buffy is The best show ever made!

0307165485|5.0|My two year old son loves this book.  He asks for it every night before bed.  We call it \\"The Lion Book.\\"  His vocabulary has increased ten-fold since we started reading it.  He's learned about shapes, sizes, colors, numbers, animals, farms, planes, cars, trucks; just about everything that could attract a little one's attention.  The stories are interesting and gentle and fun.  A great book!
B000002UAU|5.0|There isn't much that can be said from me that hasn't already been said thousands of times. The influence this album has had on popular music cannot be overstated. It remains accolade-filled even over 35 years since it's release.<br />Some of the ideas on this album were partially inspired by Frank Zappa &amp; The Mothers of Invention's FREAK OUT! (1966) and The Beach Boys' PET SOUNDS (1966), so it's recommended that you explore those albums as well. These three albums pushed the envelope of popular music at the time, and it's probably safe to say that if these three albums (and artists for that matter) didn't exist, then bands like The Moody Blues, King Crimson, Pink Floyd and several other artists would not have likely been inspired to push the popular music envelope even further.<br />The album is intricate in detail, so it's best to listen to this album on headphones to catch many of the subtleties in production. However, this does not overwhelm the actual songs, but, rather they enhance the artistic integrity and originality of the music - which, by the way, still manage to be highly infectious, diverse, and freshly spellbinding. Regardless of it's massive encomiastic reception, the album is still very lovable. From the raucous title track, to the charming &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; (how can you not love Ringo's charming vocal?) to the psychedelic space-out of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,&quot; the album is a non-stop train of ear-catching harmonies and melodies. But, there's more.<br />&quot;Getting Better&quot; with it's infectious beat, tasteful vocal harmonies, will more than likely have you singing along. &quot;Fixing A Hole&quot; is a sophisticated pop track to say the least, featuring a brief guitar line at the end of each short chorus that seems to resemble some kind of brass instrument. &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; is a slow, melodic ballad, featuring lovely vocals from Paul, gentle, hypnotically soothing backing vocals from John (at least that's who it sounds like), and not to mention, some lovely orchestral arrangements, which help to enhance the poignant atmosphere of the track immensely. Elsewhere, George Harrison's &quot;Within You Without You&quot; is an Indianesque number. The lyrics here are very introspective and somewhat spirituality-oriented, which would seem appropriate, given that George seemed to be the most spiritually-oriented of the four. The Indian Classical soundscapes are hypnotic, exotic, tasteful and entrancing. Seems very Ravi Shankar-influenced.<br />&quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; is a vaudeville-infused ballad, which exudes a naked charm, especially in Paul's vocals. &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; does not fail to enchant either with those sunny vocal harmonies. While the closing track &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; sounds quite ambiguous: you can't really tell if John Lennon is in a state of lament, indifference, or disgust. The bridge with Paul McCartney's vocal adds a light, elegant, whimsical touch to the otherwise ambiguous track.<br />Once again, the influence of this band and album are quite immense. Not much else needs to be said.om John (at least that's who it sounds like), and not to mention, some lovely orchestral arrangements, which help to enhance the poignant atmosphere of the track immensely.

B00005LB50|5.0|This Box set took 10 years to assemble, 8 of those were spent locating the best possible source tapes. Neil Young compiled the box. Neil as you all know is a stubborn man not to mention a mad scientist of sorts. This is the exact box he wanted out. I have no complaints myself. Each CD is it's own groove. You can pick one out and really have a good listen. When looked at as a whole it may seem a little redundant. Just think of it as 4 incredible mix tapes compiled by Neil for you. Never mind the repeat tracks, it's all part of a masterplan that only Neil has a good grip on. Every Neil Young fan should own this box.
B0000669JL|5.0|This isn't just the first place people start their &quot;Bob Marley&quot; collection, it's the first place they start their reggae collection. Why? Because &quot;Bob&quot; is the king of reggae, like &quot;Elvis&quot; is the king of rock n' roll. This cd is full of classics, and each one deserves to be on here. &quot;Stir it Up&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, and &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, are just three of the moving songs included. Plus the tracks &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot;, and a live &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;. These songs can be deep and thought provoking, or simple like a sunny day. Regardless of the topic though, it's hard not to smile and move your feet. After &quot;Bob Marley and the Wailers&quot;, check into &quot;Peter Tosh&quot; and &quot;HR&quot;.
0156027321|5.0|I bought this book after reading that it was the &quot;Star-gazing &quot; book pick of the month in Canyon Newspaper here in California.This is the best new novel I have read in years. It is completely refreshing. In this novel there isn't a hint of cynicism or pessimism. It is horrific and frightening, and yet optimistic in the most moving way. The only part where the sometimes inflated ego that Mr Martel has exhibited in previous books shows through (and I write this with a smile on my face) is when he suggests that the story &quot;will make you believe in God.&quot; Don't worry, it will not corrupt you into organized religion, be it Hinduism, Islam or Christianity, nor does it even try. Yet, perhaps the key to the fascinating affect that this beautiful and horrifying work has is this rare (even unique!) underlying spirituality. It is a book of symbols, which you at first believe are quite simple, slowly developing (like an avalanche) into complexity. And yet when the story is over it becomes clear in a shocking instant that, all along, the symbols were even more simple and meaningful (in the most realistic sense) than you could have ever imagined. I was mesmerized by this book and could not put it down.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Amazing.  Jethro Tull turns 35 this year, and instead of another trotted box set of reworked hits, here's a year offering THREE complete productions, a solo Ian, solo Martin, and then a Christmas Album from the band !!??  Not to mention the touring, how old are these guys?<BR>Don't get me wrong; on this CD you WON'T hear what was on Thick as a Brick or Songs from the Wood; not nearly the intensity, the feeling, the insanity of those recordings is definately gone.  Now the songs are slower, the pace is chiller; but the band continues to delivery &quot;rock&quot; in the way that they only can.  Either like the flute in the fore, like Ian's iconoclastic pessimist's twinkling eye, like it or forget it.  Either Martin Barre's guitar hits you in a special way, an undescribable way, or it doesn't.  So no, probably not a slew of new fans here.<BR>            But making the tried and true ones feel great on this holiday.  I hope Ian keeps it up and sells a million.<BR>Specially good:  Birthday card, Weathercock, Pavane, and Martin's tune at the end; not bad for being recorded completely separately.  SO THE FANS SPEAK:  IAN, GIVE US FULL ON BAND ROCKER CD; we're already in for the soft stuff (but you knew that!)  CHECK OUT A GREAT CD !!! (and the solo stuff too!)
1400034779|5.0|This book is deceptively light and delightful -- a splendid, fun change in a genre which is known -- mostly -- for its noir-appeal.  The only thing I can add to the praise for this series is that in my opinion the cover art on the English version is overwhelmingly more attractive and well-suited to the books.  Thank goodness few readers are judging this one by its (American) cover!
B0012GMZ5E|4.0|Do you like Johnny Winter when he is playing screaming, high-octane covers of old rock n' roll-standarts, or dabbling in psychedelia? Or when his music is deeply submerged in the blues, slide rattling against the fretboard of his National guitar?     Well, if you prefer the first kind of Winter, you are in for a treat.   \\"Second Winter\\" was, unsurprisingly, Johnny Winter's second album for Columbia Records. It came out in 1969, and it is one of his most stylistically diverse offerings, and probably his most idiosyncratic as well.  It is not a pure blues album, nor a rock n' roll record, although there is plenty of blues here, and a solid helping of rock n' roll as well...it is sort of psychedelic blues-rock record which includes shades of funk, hard rock, and a little bit of jazz.    Winter is backed by his usual power trio of Tommy Shannon and John \\"Red\\" Turner, plus brother Edgar Winter on piano, organ, sax, and the occational harpsichord (!). And I'll come right out and say that I didn't like this album very much when I first heard it maybe ten years ago. I had only heard a couple of Johnny Winter's records before, and those had been almost pure blues, so this odd, eclectic mix of blues, \\"old time rock n' roll\\", and psychedelia wasn't really to my liking. I've always disliked psychedelia, no matter who plays it.  But \\"Second Winter\\" has grown on me to some extend. It will never be among my favourite Johnny Winter-albums, that honour belongs to \\"White, Hot and Blue\\" and the phenomenal \\"Live Bootleg\\"-series, but it does have its moments, including the gritty opener, a powerful cover of Curtis Mayfield's \\"Memory Pain\\".    To me, Johnny Winter is at his best when he is playing the blues, and even as great as he is as both a singer and a guitarist, his covers of early rock n' roll standards are just not QUITE as mesmerizing. But, having said that, I'll be the first to admit that his take on Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" really rocks! The piano boogie of \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\" is generic but fun, and Edgar Winter is a terrific R&B piano player. He also contributes mightily to the swaggering \\"Miss Ann\\" (originally a Little Richard-tune), this time playing the sax, and Winter rips through one of the most fiery Bob Dylan-covers you'll ever hear on the classic \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". I'm a really big fan of the aforementioned \\"Bootleg\\"-series, but this is still the best version of this song I've ever heard from Johnny Winter.    The heavy blues \\"I Love Everybody\\" with its screaming, overdriven guitar attack is another highlight, and its jazzy, horn-laden sister-track \\"I Hate Everybody\\", sort of a frenetic jump-blues, is worth a listen as well. I don't think I'll ever learn to love the over-produced psychedelia of songs like \\"I'm Not Sure\\" and the pointless, over-long \\"Fast Life Rider\\", however. Give me some blues instead.    So, just to sum up, this, to me, is 3 1/2 stars. But to many people, who like a more energetic, up-tempo and not necessarily too bluesy kind of Winter, this'll be a clean five stars, I'm sure. It all depends on what kind of Winter you like.
B0000C8AQM|2.0|In response to previous query this song is not in the track listing and I think it might be Roadrunner by Johnathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. (He also sang songs in There's something about Mary.)
B000003TAB|5.0|&quot;Incesticide&quot; has great songs from Nirvana's early years and other rarities.  It's wild and brutal at times, but that was the point.  Though there should've been other songs included on here (Namely 'Blandest', 'Spank Thru', and 'Pen Cap Chew'), it's still a solid compilation.  Favorite Songs:  Aneurysm, Dive, Mexican Seafood, Been a Son, Beeswax, Hairspray Queen, AeroZeppelin, Big Long Now
B000002UKS|5.0|I have over 100 CDs and received over 30 CDs over the last year and this CD still is my favorite. Out of the 13 songs on \\"The Colour and Shape\\" 11 of them I can't get enough of. I've listened to this CD far more than any other CD I have and I never got sick of it. If you like the Foo Fighters other CDs like their self-titled album, \\"There is Nothing left to Lose,\\" and \\"One By One\\" (all of them great CDs) this album will make your head spin and take your soul to the road of extraordinary rock! \\"The Colour and Shape\\" is the top reason the Foo Fighters are my favorite band.
B0000027RL|4.0|Though I much prefer &quot;Vs&quot; to this, &quot;Ten&quot; is still a solid album.  The only problem I have with it is that I love a few of the songs so much that the rest of the songs seem inferior and I can't listen to it straight through.  Best songs:  Black, Alive, Jeremy, Once, Garden.
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"In Utero\\" is far superior to \\"Nevermind\\" musically and lyrically.  And the production is dirtier, which is most certainly not a bad thing.  Every song is a gem.  Do yourself a favor and pick this cd up NOW.  Favorite Songs:  All Apologies, Heart Shaped Box, Serve the Servants, Scentless Apprentice, Frances Farmer..., Rape Me, Pennyroyal Tea
B000003TA4|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Nevermind&quot;, I was blown away.  It's impossible to just listen to a couple songs on this cd.  Every song is great.  Though it's not my favorite Nirvana record (That title belongs to &quot;In Utero&quot;), it's still a solid album.  Favorite songs:  Lounge Act, Drain You, Lithium, Smells Like Teen Spirit (So shoot me), Come As You Are.
B0000035E7|5.0|&quot;Bleach&quot; is highly underrated.  Sure it's not as anthematic as &quot;Nevermind&quot; or as focused as &quot;In Utero&quot; but it wasn't supposed to be.  This is a fun punk record.  Favorite songs:  Blew, Paper Cuts, Big Cheese, Scoff, About a Girl, Sifting.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|When I first sat down and listened to this album I was kind of disappointed but after listening to it about 3 times now it's starting to grow on me although I still like brave new world better. But Maiden are one of the few true metal bands still around that includes Judas priest, Helloween, Iced earth, and of course Bruce dickinsons solo stuff especially accident of birth and the chemical wedding and I will continue to be a fan of Iron maiden for years to come.
0425173895|5.0|Agatha Christie is recognized throughout the world as being the \\"Queen of Crime\\". It is undoubtable that this holds true, especially in her ingeniously written, classic mystery novel, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The story is told through the 1st person point of view, so the narrator, James Sheppard ( the local doctor ), is one of the main characters. He introduces all the characters in the small English town of King's Abbot, where the story is set: Mrs. Ferrars, Flora, Ralph Paton, Ursula Bourne, Hector Blunt, Colonel Carter, the formidable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, and many more. <BR> The story begins with the suicide of Mrs. Ferrars, which stirrs confusion; Rumors say that she poisoned her first husband, that someone was blackmailing her, and that she had a secret liaison with Roger Ackroyd. The mystery surrounding her death appalls everyone even more when Roger Ackroyd is brutally stabbed to death a few days later. Hercule Poirot, accompanied by Dr. Sheppard, set out to trace the tracks of a very sharp and devious killer.<BR> I found it extremely captivating up to the very end, which I found was the best part of the novel. There are so many twists in the plot, red herrings, clues, and foreshadowing, yet the solution to the crime completely eludes the reader until told. All the characters and their different possible motives, which Agatha Christie carefully presents, are subject to questioning; therefore, at one point or another, I suspected almost everyone to have committed the murder.<BR>  What I loved most is that I was caught off-guard many times while reading. I have a vague idea in my head and then when I turn the next page, I'm proved wrong. Agatha Christie has an unbelievable imagination and talent that she is able to make such a simple detail become the turning point in the mystery. You are always expecting the opposite of what truly happens,and I think that is what is brilliant about her writing, and especially this novel.<BR> In the end, whenyou are told the conclusion to the story, the shock is so tremendous that it creates a smile on the reader's face. Automatically, you realize how obvious the answer was and how from the very beginning, the cards were layed out on the table face-up, yet you are still incredibly decieved.<BR> I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to have an insightful and captivating time trying to unravel the mystery of the death of Roger Ackroyd!
0743243307|5.0|This Booker Prize-nominated novel provides engaging characters and thought-provoking insight into the Muslim immigrant world.<br />The main character, Nazneen, is a young &quot;unspoiled&quot; Bangladeshi village girl who enters into an arranged marriage with a much older Bangladeshi who lives in London.  Her beautiful sister defies her father's wishes and elopes in a love match, running off to Dakha. Nazneen has been raised to accept whatever happens to her, but in London, gradually (over the course of 15 years or so) begins to take control of her own life.<br />Her husband Chanu at first seems clownlike, for example, he frames a collection of meaningless certificates for very minor achievements.  Chanu  regards himself as a scholar, because he has a BA from a Bangladeshi university, but he realizes that in Britain, he is regarded as nobody of any importance). Nazneen is expected to trim his corns every night, and later, his daughters are expected to sit beside him as he reads to turn the pages for him.  But Chanu is a complex person who has a good heart, and the reader develops a fondness for this would-be patriarch.  Life has not turned out as he wanted or expected, but he is devoted to his family.<br />Nazneen, on the other hand, had no expectations of life but has been swept along like a piece of wood in a river.  Her transformation -- how to combine the traditional values and reject what is problematic in the western world while recognizing what is bad about the old ways and changing -- forms the plot of the book.<br />In the background is her sister's story, told in letters; the sister, who was more proactive in her choices, suffers the consequences, and it's hard to avoid wondering if the sister would not have been better off in an arranged marriage.  The reader is left pondering Western vs. non-Western values, particularly with regard to love and marriage.<br />Like other reviewers, I found the use of broken English in her sister's letters baffling and annoying -- fortunately they were a comparatively small part of the book.  If her sister was writing in Bengali, wouldn't it be grammatical at least?  And why would her sister write in English (which would explain the bad grammar)?<br />The author has done a great job of creating a very different world for the reader to inhabit.  Life for Muslim women both in a council estate (public housing project) in London (Nazneen's story) and a large city in Bangladesh (her sister's story) are described vividly and without romantic illusions.<br />This is not a quickly read book, but it certainly held my interest all the way through, and I will remember these characters for a long time.
B00000DFTG|4.0|Well, it's an Epic release, anyway.    \\"Reunion\\" is as close to an official live album as the original Black Sabbath-lineup has had in their 34-year career. 1980's \\"Live At Last\\" was released without their permission, and 1982's \\"Live Evil\\" featured then-singer Ronnie James Dio.   But here it is, finally, and \\"Reunion\\" does not disappoint. Culled from a series of concerts in their native Birmingham in December 1997, it includes their most enduring classics (\\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"War Pigs\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\").   And Sabbath manages to avoid the most common pitfall of live recordings: speeding up the songs. This is crucial, since songs like \\"Sweet Leaf\\", \\"Black Sabbath\\", and \\"Snowblind\\" owe a lot of their unique personality and somber atmospherics to the band's trademark snail's pace.     The drums are exceptionally well recorded (that is, loud), and everything is louder than everything else, just the way it should be. (Or in plain English: you can hear everything just about equally well; nothing is mixed into the background.)  I wouldn't have put \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\\" on right after \\"War Pigs\\" (it becomes very obvious that \\"Wall\\" is just \\"Pigs\\" with a slightly altered melody and a different arrangement).  And Ozzy Osbourne's vocals aren't quite as strong as the were 30 years ago (he can't hit the highest notes during \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"). But he can still carry a tune, something which he couldn't always 30 years ago, and guitarist Tony Iommi has lost absolutely none of his impressive chops.    Bill Ward lays down an appropriately heavy beat, one which doesn't just plod along without variation, but actually shows what a fine heavy metal drummer Ward is. And Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler was always one of heavy metal's best and most orginal bass players.  Tony Iommi's searing lead guitar belies the fact that he lost the tips of his fingers in an accident back in the late 60s (it was that which caused him to tune down, slackening the stringsenough for him to fret them without too much pain).     Highlights include the old concert favorite \\"Children Of The Grave\\", during which Iommi plays a rare single-string solo; a roaring \\"Paranoid\\", a monstrously heavy, doom-laden \\"Black Sabbath\\", an appropriately epic \\"War Pigs\\", and a wonderfully macabre \\"Iron Man\\", which sends the crowd into a frenzy as soon as Tony Iommi strikes the opening F chord.   And listen to Iommi's playing on \\"Into The Void\\" and the impressive \\"Spiral Architect\\", proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Sabbath never did need a second guitarist.    Unlike many of their early-70s counterparts, Black Sabbath still manage to sound inspired, and they rock with totally believable sincerity on \\"Reunion\\", proving once and for all that they were not only the first true heavy metal band, they remain the greatest one as well.  4 1/2 stars.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Really, I just don't know how this DVD could be any better.<br />It seems like every night, Dave and Jay have some new band on stage.  Some angst-projecting vocalist trying to sound like Kurt Cobain, some guitarist who knows 5 chords and 2 ways to strum each one, a bassist who plays one note at a time, and a drummer who knows only one rythem - bump-bah-bump-bah-bump-bah-badump.  But no matter how bad they are, they all have one thing in common - they're all pretty enough for MTV.  It's enough to make me scream in frustration, because I know how good rock and roll can really be, and THIS DVD is it.<br />Patch your DVD player through your stereo, put masking tape on all your window glass, stuff the dog's ears with cotton, protect all small children with DOT approved devices, then pop this DVD in and hide under the couch, because THIS is rock and roll as it was and is meant to be - master musicians with genuine f--- it all attitude, playing through 10 tons of Marshall Hiwatt amps.  In the late 70's there was a famous ad in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; showing a guy sitting in an armchair in front of a speaker, with his necktie being blown straight back behind him.  Picture that, and you get an idea of what this movie and this band are all about.<br />The movie itself is half comedy and half action-drama.  The comedy comes during interviews and conversations with the band, with Keith initiating most of it and everyone else either joining in or, in the case of the slick corporate &quot;host&quot; types, getting skewered.  The action-drama is all on stage, with Pete whirling his way through incredible guitar playing, Roger providing his usual peerless singing, Keith bringing something almost otherworldly to his drums, and John holding it all down, standing there motionless like the rock of gibralter, his fingers on the bass a blur.<br />Unlike so many modern bands, who surround themselves with &quot;star&quot; mystique and who are always safe and cool on stage, The Who wereself-deprecating and able to laugh at themselves when they weren't playing, and when they were playing... well, when they were playing, they consistently reached for the stars.  Sometimes it didn't work - sometimes they sounded like crap.  But when they were in the sweet spot, when they were in &quot;the zone,&quot; they were, to use the apt words of another reviewer, &quot;the greatest rock and roll band ever to draw breath.&quot;<br />Most of what you get in this DVD special edition is &quot;in the zone,&quot; and what little isn't, doesn't really detract from the experience.  Everyone who worked on producing this DVD edition should get a medal, as the film looks and sounds as close to perfection as it is ever going to get.<br />By the way, if you are listening through an old-fashioned, two speaker system, choose &quot;stereo&quot; under sound options.  The reviewer who panned the sound, probably hadn't tried that option yet - on my system (Carver tuner with 2 Dahlquist DQM-9 Compact loudspeakers) choosing &quot;stereo&quot; cleaned up the sound greatly.<br />Unfortunately, most of the people who buy this DVD, probably already know how great it is.  You won't be disappointed, and if you show it to a friend or two, maybe the memory of The Who won't die with us.  There's never been another band like them, and this DVD does them justice for the ages.
B00005ATQF|5.0|It wasn't shot in widescreen. You call yourself a Kubrick fan? This isn't pan&scan. It's fullscreen. It's the way Kubrick intended. If there's ever a widescreen version of this movie, the picture will be cropped off. Kubrick only used widescreen for a few of his films. Full Metal Jacket was not one of them.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Great soundtrack, great movie, enough said.  I agree with R Diep about that Elle Driver song.  It should be on the soundtrack.  Just to let ya'll know it is by Rizo of the Woo Tang Clan, tho.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna doesn't re-invent herself. She basically just follows the latest trends. Right now, white rappers are in... so, I guess that's Madonna's cue to change her whole image... Next year the trend will be deathmetal... I'd like to see Madonna tackle THAT genre... obviously, she'll give it a try if it's the latest thing...<br />Like I said, laughable...
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Maybe Star Trek V isn't the best Trek movie, but it's still much better than most movies I've seen. It has more humor than any of the original crew movies besides Star Trek IV. At times, the blend between the humor and the seriousness of the plot doesn't mesh very well, but it's still good overall.<br />As for the Special Edition DVD, it is just what the movie needed. The extras are a real treat with the movie, from the documentary on the making of the movie to about every commercial and trailer that could be imagined.
0375707972|5.0|Having been fascinated with modern Germany throughout my life, this book literally left me in tears. Most reviews see the book on a surface level. That of a story of a young German in the late 1950's falling in love with a beautiful, older blonde, 36 year old Hanna, whom in Part 2 of the book we find out shockingly was a 21 year old SS Guard during the last two years of WWII.<br />Not knowing what you now know above, but being very sensitive myself to modern Germany, and the feeling of modern Germany and its contrast with the older Nazi period and the feelings that entailed, I became aware that \\"Hanna\\" was more than the \\"girlfriend\\" of young Michael Berg in the book, she was an allegory for the feelings many many Germans felt for the period itself. The deep love affair that Germany had with Nazism and the ultimate realisation of the newer generation of what happened in the past is mirrored in the book. <br />The book stands as it is. Although non fiction it states the case \\"as is\\". To me it is clearly anti-Nazi, although that does not mean that it does not appreciate the affair that Germans have and had with their national psyche and their past. <br />The first clue that the author gives us that Hanna does represent the \\"old\\" Germany is the description of the apartment block she lives in. Then the way she seduces him...(just the way many Germans perceive that the \\"movement\\" grabbed Germany itself) and the ending and her sudden disappearance (just like the Nazi regime came to a sudden end).<br />This book is about the deep murmurings of the German soul. And its search for forgiveness, for answers, and the suicide of Hanna and the small donation she left behind signifying the sorry state that represents the resolution of the problem for Germany in the years since the war. <br />Namely that the war does and will continue to knaw at the German soul. That it is impossible to really reconcile what happened. That, as Schlink so clearly states that films like Schindlers List drive open the reality of what happened in a way that even many people involved could not appreciate at the time, and it makes salient points about the feelings, repressed and otherwise that Germany and Germans carry with them to this day.<br />Had Germany won the war, an ex SS man noted on a documentary I was watching the other day, no one would have been writing all this up as so terrible - just the price of war on the eastern front. After all, it is the victor who usually gets to write the history of the event. <br />And in all this lies the brilliance of the book. On the one hand it extends out the hand of understanding and sympathy (not forgiveness) to a people, regime and phenomenon of a time corrupted by a force of evil that and who's consequences were so terrible that they continue to invade and pervade the nation of Germany to this very day.<br />In a sense the reality of the limited atonement and bewilderment of a nation defeated and shamed but once proud and in a sense still proud feels. The juxtaposition might lead one to see the book as having Nazi sympathies, but I think not. It is rather a presentation of the facts<br />An affair of an entire nation with a movement that existed and a time that came and went with a generation that has for the most part now died but whom in the 1950's were still very much part of German life.<br />At the end of the book Mark arranges a holiday to go off with Hanna again, but she commits suicide just before her release from prison. This is after she has read, understood and atoned. <br />This to me signifies closure and the death of the movement. Its about moving on. And yet the reality of the book conveys that there can be no simple closure and that some things are always there....
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|First off, I'm sick of all these people bad mouthing this movie on this forum.  I haven't seen this DVD but I'm giving it 5 stars because I like the movie.  I'm not going to go into all this whatnots about historical accuracy.  We all know by now this movie isn't historically accurate.  All these reviewers are venting and are giving this DVD 1 star can kiss my ****.  I mean seriously, I want to know about the DVD (picture, new scenes, etc.) and not about what they like about the movie.  I've probably read more than two dozen reviews and haven't come accross one review worth mentioning about this DVD.  I hope someone will come forward and write a review about this DVD and not vent.

B0000C8AQM|4.0|Pretty decent compilation here.  In regards to the 'mystery song' in question, I believe you're talking about &quot;Roadrunner USA&quot;.  It was originally sung by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts but I know the Sex Pistols did a cover as well.  Hope this helps!
6305754969|4.0|I got the feeling that Hawks was sitting around one day wondering what movie to make next when he happened upon the Rio Bravo script and, as a joke, suggested making it all over again. The movie execs, sniffing money, said why not and so El Dorado was born.<br />Wayne reprises the Wayne part, Mitchum the Martin, Caan the Nelson and Hunnicutt the Brennan. Wayne is noticeably older and paunchier and doesn't quite have the chemistry with Mitchum that he had with Martin but it's not a bad effort. Hunnicutt's deadpan delivery is almost as amusing as Brennan's moaning and shrieking. James Caan is a better actor than Nelson if perhaps not so easy on the eye.<br />Buy both movies, watch both and love both.

B00005OAIE|3.0|John Mayer writes some good songs, and the music is also very well done. I can get into almost every song on this cd, as I rarely find the need to press faast forward when I pop it in. However, this cd just doesn't have the sticking power like a Dave Matthews or a Jack Johnson, his songs are well wrote, but seem bubble gummy at times, and about nothing of any substance. Overall a decent debut album.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|This was by far the best XMEN movie I have ever seen.  I love Wolverine.  The action choreographer did an excellent job staging the fight scenes in the school.  The exquisite way that Magneto slyly remarks to Pyro the \\"you are a God among men\\" attitude I just love that scene.  I was so glad to see Halle Berry more active than the first.  Congratulations to all who participated in making this movie great.  I have seen it 8 times already.
B000089RVR|1.0|The only good song on this CD is &quot;White Flag&quot;.  The rest of the songs are unpleasant to say the least and not what I expected from Dido.  Her vocals are anemic and at times almost impossible to hear even when the volumn is turned up.  I tried listening to the CD more than once in hopes that it would grow on me but instead it became more annoying and I put the CD in my charity pile to give away.
B00006690G|5.0|well ive had this cd for over a year now, i got it before it came out because i was at a music festival the weekend before it came out and eminem was the closer, so they were selling the new cd then. i wouldnt even write about this cd because everyone here describes it pretty well, with a few execptions. for the people who say all it is is fast talk and cussing obviously dont know what theyre talking about, bc first, this is probably eminmen's softest album lyric wise, and second, its a work of lyrical genius. no emcee today keeps it as real as eminem and discusses actual topics these days. this isnt your ordinary &quot;hip hop&quot; cd about sex, money, and cars. the things eminem flows about are real and the perspective he puts on it are brilliant. i dont think there are many emcees out there who can flow and put perspective on things as well as eminem does. anyone who downs this cd for lyrics isnt listening to the lyrics on the album or is your typical rap fan who looks for the head bumping beat and same ole hook with the same ole repetitive lyrics. i think this is a cd almost anyone could enjoy if u sit down and listen to what hes saying. the production on the cd is incredible, and everything else is incredible as well. buy it if u dont have it, but im sure theres not too many at this point who havent bought this cd.
0385504209|5.0|To everyone who gave this one star and claimed it was blasphemous.  CALM DOWN!!  It's just a work of fiction.  It doesn't make any claims that everything happened just as they are stating it...it's merely offering another view into spirituality and the birth of modern day christianity. Who cares if this book has some inaccuracies?  It was entertaining.  Some claimed to have found this book disturbing.  It is more disturbing to me to see people who have such blind faith in what the Bible says.  Try opening your mind just a fraction.

B00005JKZV|5.0|This film has been compared to The Empire Strikes Back in that is the dark chapter of the trilogy.  But far more goes on in this film than in Empire (probably because this was a massive book before being a film).<br />The Fellowship has ended but there is much to be done.  Aragorn and company race to find Merry and Pippin, their missing Hobbit companions.<br />Frodo and Sam continue to make their way towards Mordor and Mt. Doom.  They are joined and led by Gollum.<br />Sauruman is increasing his power but making powerful enemies as well.<br />The lands of Rohan and Gondor are brought into war thus bringing most of Middle Earth into the growing conflict as Sauron gains power and looks for the Ring.<br />This is not the same story as the book, but it is close.  One major improvement was that the class difference between Sam and Frodo was far more obvious.  The special effects were quite good but many will complain about the major changes in plot (far larger than those in the first movie), but it works as a film as everything ties up at the same time and sets the stage for the final push in the third film.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|While this may not be Maynard's typical work, you may be used to longer songs with a variation of endings, I feel this CD really showed good artistic ability.  Not only is put together very well, musically, but also, lyrically, it is phenominal.  My favorite tracks on the album are The Noose, Blue, and Pet.  Weak and Powerless is also very good, but I really love the whole CD.  It's hard to pick a favorite.  I really recommend purchasing this album, and this isn't just coming from a loyal Tool or A Perfect Circle fan, but a good music fan.  I bought the CD the day it went on sale, and I actually found myself crying to some of the songs because they completely empowered me.  Maynard has that talent, plus Billy has just done some phenominal work on the album as well.

B00003CX97|5.0|REVISED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW:<br /><br />The new Blu-ray of \\"Bridge\\" looks marvelous with a depth and detail only hinted at with the previous DVD editions of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes \\"Crossing the Bridge\\" a picture-in graphics track and a documentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes a replica of lobby cards, information from the original press book for the film in a book housed in the hardcover BD holder and a DVD edition of the film in addition to the Blu-ray. Highly recommend for fans of the film.<br /><br />DVD REVIEW BELOW:<br /><br />David Lean blossomed as a film director during the 50's. While he directed a number of earlier classics during the 40's, Bridge on the River Kwai was the first of many epic films that never lost the most important part of any epic tale--the human element.<br /><br />Although \\"Bridge\\" is inspired by a true story keep in mind that this isn't a documentary of the events that occurred there and Lean uses it to tell a dramatic story about survival, pride and the insanity of war. Novelist Pierre Boulle was a prisoner of war in Thailand and used the story of the building of the bridge as a backdrop for a fictionalized portrayal of those events combining them with his experience as a POW and the people that Boulle knew as a POW.<br /><br />Bridge focuses on the Japanese attempt to build a bridge linking their railroad through a perilous jungle in Southeast Asia. The prisoners of war are used essentially as slave labor to reach this goal. Colonel Nicholson(Alec Guinness who won an Oscar)are captured with his British troops. Nicholson's  can-do attitude creates a myopic outlook which prevents him from seeing that he is collaborating with the enemy when he agrees to help complete the bridge. It's the infusion that Japanese Prison Commander Saito needs; his prisoner worker population is shrinking rapidly. Dysintery, Malaria, heatstroke and other inhabitants of the jungle have killed most of the workers. The bridge is behind schedule and the Colonel Saito is very displeased.<br /><br />One of the last remaining prisoners is Shears (played with marvelous cynicism by William Holden). He just wants to do as little as possible and return home alive and well from the war. He has an escape plan. When he informs Nicholson of this, he's told that the British will not attempt to escape as there \\"is no place to escape to\\". Nicholson feels they'll be better treated in the camp and doesn't want his troops to face the harsh jungle. He orders his troops not to escape given the circumstances.<br /><br />Shears and two other prisoners make a break for it. Of the three only Shears survives, is shot and eventually found within Allied territory. He's taken to a British stronghold to recover. Shears provides info on the bridge. He doesn't want become involved in an effort to go back and blow it up. Blackmailed by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins)he ends up volunteering for the mission with Warden and one other American.<br /><br />Lean's direction captures the atmosphere of the jungle perfectly. While amazon.com rates the image as a 4 out of 5, I'd give it a 3. While a restoration effort was attempted, it's nowhere near as complete as that done for Lawrence of Arabia (another Lean film)or Hitchcock's Vertigo and Rear Window. Bridge has a much more brutal look which captures the essence of the jungle and the odds facing Shears and Warden. On the other hand, the film has a lot of analog artifacts and, although I can't be certain, looks like the negative has faded a bit. While it isn't in as bad a condition as Lawrence (or Vertigo)was, it certainly could use a face lift to improve the appearence.<br /><br />The sound is pretty good overall. Columbia has expanded the original soundtrack into a Dolby 5.1 master and, while it doesn't take advantage of the full range, it coulds much better than the earlier VHS edition.<br /><br />There are two editions of this classic film. The first has a seconddisc full of worthwhile extras that includes behind the scenes footage, a documentary on the film, appreciation by director John Millius many more items. The two disc set is certainly worthwhile for fans of the film.<br /><br />The single disc edition is a dual layer like the first disc of the two disc set. It looks like it came from the same master. It features the full film, trailers and a brief talent biography on Holden, Guinness, Hawkins and Lean. It hasn't been updated since Guinness' death a couple of years ago. It's not bare bones but for the price difference it should suffice for most fans. It features the same interactive menu (a clever use of actual scenes from the movie)and a motion scene selection.<br /><br />Bridge is a great film and it's certainly worthwhile in either edition. Which one you purchase depends on how much of a fan you are of the film and whether or not you'll watch the background material more than one time. The picture and sound are very good but it's also clear that Columbia sound undertake a more complete restoration of the this classic film.<br /><br />Oh, a bit of trivia--the main titles have been changed. When the film was released screenwriters Michael Wilson (Lawrence of Arabia, Planet of the Apes) and Carl Foreman (The Guns of Navarone)were still blacklisted writers in Hollywood. Novelist Piere Boulle (who spoke no English)fronted for them receiving screenplay credit and received the Oscar for screenplay. It's only fitting that their names have finally been added to the opening credits. This happened shortly before Foreman's death (if I'm not mistaken)so at least one of them lived to see a wrong righted.

0156027321|2.0|In the Pacific ocean of praise for this book, I have to sound a critical note. As many others, I was ready to love this book after all the hype surrounding the Booker win. Alas....the book is too self conscious to be engaging, too puffed up to be sincere, too melodramatic to trust. It could appeal to many adventure seeking readers of young age ( minus the mushy spirituality) but it is too winded to hold restless young minds. For this adult reader, the major mood after reading it in one seating was - &quot; this could be written by senile Salman Rushdie who tries to win the Hollywood crowd&quot;. It lacks subtlety, wisdom, grace, strangeness of really great work of literature. As for the endless spiritual cliches...only feeble minded can find any divinity in them.
B00003CXD5|2.0|One of the greatest movies ever made. One of the worst DVD transfers of a major movie by a major studio. Parts of the movie have a crystal sharp picture than one would expect of a DVD. Others scenes are grainy beyond belief. I have all of Ed Wood's movies on DVD and the picture quality is overall superior. What kind of a world do we live in where Ed Wood movies are restored and John Huston movies are treated like a $ 20 mule? I saw a laser disk of this years ago that had reasonably good video. Wish Warner had borried it instead of whatever they used. Of course it's a great movie. The movie deserves 500 stars and the DVD zero. And to quote Bogie &quot;Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean.&quot;
B000002MP2|1.0|Green Day's Dookie is arguably their best LP. I have read many of the reviews and decided to comment. Do not get it twisted. GREEN DAY IS NOT PUNK! If you are looking for a great punk album this is a bad choice. HOwever, Dookie is one of the most influential bands of the 90's. It paved the way for so many lesser and far more trivial acts like blink, New Found Glory, etc. It stills remains at the top of the genre it created. With radio gems like Longview, Basketcase, When I Come Around, and She how could you go wrong? This is definitly in my top 3 favorite albums of all time. If you are a bored, confused, angry, teen, (like most are). I would strongly advise purchasing this CD. It perfectly describes the teen angst we've all been through. Some say it's unoriginal. I agree. But it is definitly by far the best pop-punk album ever made.PERIOD!!!
0380789019|5.0|This book was one of the most satisfying reads I've had in a very long time.  It's darkness was the kind of darkness that makes me feel right and true.  I flew thru this book and when I was done, I wished to the ability to draw a door on the wall and pass right thru it.<br />If you are considering buying this book and reading reviews to help you make your decision, well, if you're even thinking of getting a Gaiman book you must be of the ilk that will enjoy the story immensly.  Just don't look for an imitation of his Sandman series - his creativity spreads far and wide.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I'm thrilled that one of the last Disney movies that I've really loved is finally out on DVD.  I could say a zillion glowing things about this movie that you probably agree with or already know.  I have to admit that I do, however, have a slight issue or two with this DVD release. <br />I know this is going to sound ridiculously funny but there is, quite simply, way too much packed on to this release.  &quot;The Lion King&quot; IS an important movie and in time will most certainly be a Disney Classic, if not just a &quot;film classic&quot;, Disney or not.  (I think a movie needs to have been around for at least 20 years or so before it can be called &quot;a classic&quot;, and it's sort of annoying that Disney sticks that word on just about everything they release regardless of whether it's new or old.)  There's just a lot on here that seems unnecessary.  <br />Let me start with the good stuff: the movie has never looked or sounded better. Great care has been taken to improve an already great film.  Make sure you click on &quot;Enhanced Home Theater Mix&quot; to watch the movie if you have more than just a TV hooked up to your DVD player.  It sounds a zillion times better than the Dolby 5.1 stereo mix. The commentary is the same as the one that appeared on the laserdisc release. It's a fun, concise talk that will pretty much supply anyone with what they need to know about &quot;The Lion King.&quot;  The behind-the-scenes extras with Elton John are also quite enjoyable and informative, as is the short piece about Julie Taymor, who did the Broadway musical.<br />Okay, the not-so-great stuff: several documentaries that drone on and on about things most viewers, especially children, won't care about; a piece featuring footage of real lions eating their prey (that's something I really didn't want to see). The menu screens seem a little overwhelming to navigate.  Some people might get frustrated, thinking &quot;I don't care about the rest of the stuff, just let me see themovie!!&quot;  Like I said before, there's just way too much unnecessary stuff on here. The kiddie games that can be played with a remote control and some of the other stuff should have perhaps been released on a separate DVD (maybe as a freebie that you send in for with proof-of-purchase) for diehard fans, thus making this DVD easier to control. I'm sure there will be diehard fans out there that take offense to my statement saying that they didn't have any trouble navigating.  Good for them, I'm happy.  All I'm saying is that casual viewers that perhaps don't use their DVD players on a daily basis might get a bit confused.<br />The absolute worst thing on here has to be the &quot;Circle Of Life&quot; music video, performed by the Disney Channel &quot;Circle Of Stars.&quot;  It's just rather, well... stupid.  There seems to be a disturbing trend on Disney DVD's of including extremely tired new versions of songs, performed by marginally talented musical outfits.  Disney needs to put the kibosh on this immediately!  The videos are obviously aimed at children, but to think that kids would enjoy this is a rather insulting thought.  <br />The weird and quite unnecessary carboard sleeve is here, too (just like what was released with &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;).  The gatefold sleeve opens to reveal just what is on the DVD, which I suppose is really nice to know, if you are standing in a store wondering, but c'mon! This is a Disney DVD and people are going to buy it regardless of whether they know exactly how full of extras it is.  It just seems wasteful because the plastic snap case that slides out of the cardboard sleeve is a good enough cover on its own.  I'm sure a lot of people just throw this cardboard sleeve away, even though you can tell it wasn't cheap to produce.  Knock off the cardboard sleeve nonsense, and knock off a buck or two off the list price while you're at it Disney!<br />Having said all of that, this really is a great DVD release- even with all of the superfluous extras that would take you days to watch.

0694003611|5.0|My husband reads this book to our 4-month-old son every night after he gets home from work.  They both love it and I enjoy listening to him read this to our son.  I have it memorized and I've hardly ever read it to our son.  It's wonderful.  I like the way it changes between black and white pages and color.
0441172717|5.0|I do not generally write reviews but this book was a necessary exception. I loved it. From the second I began to the instant it concluded, I was completely engrossed.<br />The world that Frank Herbert creates is believable (as much so as can be expected for the genre) and the characters are very real. They suffer and we suffer; they succeed and we are irrepressibly happy. It is a well-written novel with an engaging plot. Above all, however, the book addresses universally applicable themes and profound concepts. It is this fact that allows Dune to transcend to a higher plane than the average science-fiction novel.<br />The only negative aspect I found with this book is that, upon finishing it, I was terrified to experience anything else, any of its other forms. The sequels(Dune Messiah, House Harkonnen, etc.) and the movie stood no chance at all in matching this masterpiece. I am, to this day, paralyzed with the thought that at some time I may inadvertently witness some horrific misappropriation of the beautiful original. It would be a vile tragedy.
0805047905|5.0|My son loves to look at all the colorful pages, ofset by a white background (except the page with a white dog, where the background of the page is black).  The book repeats a lot which is nice for a little person learning to read -- it's predictable and makes it fun for him.
B00005JLO2|5.0|This movie was truly a dynamic master work. The actors, and actresses made this movie come alive, I was literally in tears at the end of this wonderful film. This DVD is one for your collection. This movie will be loved by all both male and female, it's journey through war, love, cowardness, redemotion, peace, &amp; friendship. With an all star cast this movie has it all.
B000068CNX|5.0|Ahhh, the season where Ross and Rachel FINALLY become a couple!  All through the 1st season, we witnessed Ross's many attempts to express his feelings for Rachel.  In this season, Ross and Rachel become a couple, but it wasn't easy for them to get there.  At the beginning of this season, Ross meets a woman named Julie, who is his girlfriend for the first couple of months and Rachel shows her jealously throughout Ross and Julie's relationship.  Ross breaks up with Julie when he discovers that Rachel has feelings for him.  But Ross does something that angers Rachel to the very core of her being; he makes a list that compares her and Julie.  Rachel finds out about the list and blows off Ross for a couple of months.  Then Rachel views a video of her and Monica going to senior prom.  Rachel's date is late, so Monica's father suggests Ross take Rachel to the prom.  Ross didn't think it was a very good idea, but he goes along with it anyways.  But, when Ross is upstairs getting ready, Rachel's date shows up, leaving Ross heartbroken.  Rachel never knew about this until she sees the prom video.  As soon as the video is over, Rachel kisses Ross and they finally become a couple.  This is also the season where Monica meets and falls in love with the man of her dreams.  But their romance is short-lived due to a serious matter.  This is defintely a great DVD to add to your Friends collection.  Hope you enjoy!!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|When I first saw this film in the theater's I found myself neither hating nor overly thrilled about it.  Many people tend to lean either onw direction or another on the quality of this sequel, either they fully enjoyed it or they utterly despised it.  For me I think it is more of a clear sign of what can happen if an artist over extends themselves with multiple projects and loses focus through their work.  <BR>When planning out the next sequels to their first installment in there series, the Wakowski brothers wanted to try and incoporate the event into as many mediums as possible to try and accomplish a media event that was previously unheard of.  They attacked on all fronts via their website with information on the films as well as the short animes collected into The Animatrix, through short film releases of &quot;Flight of the Osiris&quot;, and thorugh the video game forum with Enter the Matrix and were incharge and helped to write out much of the work for these collaborations wiht the other forums.  They tried to keep afloat of all of this while at the same time work on a film that had as its predicessor a film that with a detailed and well thought out approach to science fiction and action had gone on to entrench itself into the culture.  The main reason that the first Matrix film was so successful, however, was because of its characters and the action.  Neither were singled out over the other.  Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the others exhibited real thoughts and emotions compared to their computer program counter parts that were trying to destroy them.  They made you feel the difference between both worlds and just what they were trying to fight and protect.  In the sequel, however, this feeling of danger and survival is lost.  Do not get me wrong, I actually enjoyed the script.  I felt that it was original and was presenting the audience with something that was clever, such as its notions of the role for the keymaker and the image of the architect that neo encounters by the end of the film.  All of these characters were new and vibrant images brought to the screen, yet the film itself did not capture the audience.  I feel that the problem for this lied in the actual tempo of the movie.  Nothing during the duration of the film seems to carry any feel of importance.  As the events occur you never actually find yourself caring for the characters as much as you did in the first film.  They seemed replaced by those for which they were fighting against in the first film.  All of the title roles seemed drained of their humanity as the events which we are supposed to feel should be dire for they could possible end the war between man and machine begin to unfold.  It almost seems as if the Wakowskis were more worried about accomplishing the biggest action sequences in film history rather than creating what could have been one of the greatest movie series in film history.  Instead we are given a average follow up to a far superior film that dealt with issues ranging from how do we know what we are really here to accomplish, knowing who we are selves really are, and the power that choice and the ability to make decisions for our actions is what makes us human and why we can not allow it to be obliterated.  Perhaps, however, with everything the Wakowski's were trying to accomplish they spread themselves to thin and that is what hurt Reloaded more than anything.  As I said before, their attention seemed to only lie more on their next big action scene rather than just what thier characters were conveying within the scene.  Of, at the same time, should we really accept such an excuse as the creators being pulled into many directions as an acceptable reason for loss of quality in work, especially with the amount of time they were being given to accomplish their tasks.  For in the end, what these movies should really be about is real world of humanity and why it is more important, or should be, than the sterilized world of the machines.  Neo and the rest should embark everything that makes us different and just what they are fighting for.  It shouldnot matter how many Agent Smith's he fights or how many cars our destroyed, it should only matter if we find ourselves caring about the characters and their fight for life.  I think this is the main problem and the fact that the Wakowski's forget when they put this film together, instead viaing for visual appeal over the mental.
6305428387|5.0|I remember I first saw this movie when I was a little girl. I absolutely loved it! Not only could I relate to the Jamaican characters, but I could feel the emotions as they were filmed-- defeat, determination, betrayal, cultural insensitivity. I cried at the end. This was a wonderful film about determination.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD is brilliant it has it all. This is the freshest CD Ive ever heard except for perhaps Dark Side of the Moon. Its lyrics are amazing, its bass is great, the feeling of it is just perfect but the best part is Johnny Greenwoods amazing guitar playing just plain perfection. Not one note is hit wrong on this CD buy it, your life will change.
B00000I07Q|5.0|The best of the bunch.  The words of these songs and the music is perfect Bon Jovi.  Perfect rock.  I will listen to this album with a smile on my face forever.
0156027321|4.0|This is the type of book I wanted to like a lot more, but which just didn't get me emotionally involved.  It gets 4 stars because there's no 3 1/2 to give it, pushed up rather than down largely because of the ending (which raises all kinds of wonderful questions about everything that came before).  The first half of the book follows Pi Patel's life up to the age of 16, mostly dealing with his quest for religion and the animals in his family's Indian zoo, both in a great deal more detail than could possibly be interesting.  I mean I love animals, but lists of all the animals in the zoo and all the things they do just seem to be taking up space after awhile.  The numerous religious musings in ponderous language get to seem like a parody of how Westerners think Indians talk.  All of which is just a very long lead in to the heart of the story, which is Pi's survival at sea in a lifeboat after the sinking of the ship carrying Pi, his family, and the zoo animals to Canada to start a new life.<br />The second half of the book is taken up with long descriptions of Pi's first days at sea and the plight of the animals that have taken refuge with him.  Warning to sensitive readers -- a lot of the descriptions of the suffering of Pi and the animals are quite brutal and told in excruciating detail.  The book's cover description may make this seem like a cute or allegorical tiger that shares Pi's days at sea, but it is a real tiger, with a real tiger's appetite and instincts that the author describes for a good half of this book.  The author is extremely good at taking us through Pi's plight and his suffering.  After awhile, however, although I cared about Pi and admired his cleverness and his will to survive, I found Pi's monotony becoming my own.  I discovered how much my initial enthusiasm had waned after I accidentally forgot where I was, and reread an entire scene, not realizing until after I'd reread it that I had forgotten a major plot point.  There's also something aboutthe rather devious framing device that left me with a somewhat bad taste about this book.<br />I have to give credit to the author, however, for his patience in taking us through Pi's days at sea at a pace appropriate to what his protagonist suffers, and to creating a wonderfully ambiguous ending that makes you question what we will really do to survive.  Any more than this would be a spoiler.  This is a good read, one worth the effort, but don't expect the read of the year.
B000056HRZ|1.0|I would like to have rated this 'video' zero-stars, but 1-star is as bad as it can be rated.The film may be great, we were very anxious to see this old movie but we found ourselves 'locked into' over 45 minutes of real Hollywood hype stuff. Thank goodness for 'fast forward'. If we had known this video was full of this, we would NEVER have wasted our money. We refuse to even look at it, it's going into the garbage tonight -- good riddance.
B000002KIE|2.0|The Sex Pistols were a manufactured band designed to exploit the underground punk scene, which had been around for years before them.  The Velvet Underground and Iggy & the Stooges were the true originals, the NY Dolls later took it and glammed it up, the Ramones then took it and stripped it down, and finally (like the Monkees once did to the Beatles and Stones) the Sex Pistols then prostituted themselves to become the face of punk rock.  Not that they didn't produce some good tracks in the process.  \\"God Save the Queen\\" and \\"Pretty Vacant\\" are great spitting rock energy tunes, but really.....are they any better or worse than \\"Paint it Black\\" or \\"Born to be Wild\\" ??  Remember, even the Monkees put out a couple great tracks like \\"(I'm not your) Stepping Stone\\" and \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday.\\"  John Lydon today denounces that whole Pistols era, but that doesn't keep him from (...) himself to do a $$$$ Reunion tour.  That's why the Ramones and Clash can make the Rock hall of Fame, but neither the Sex Pistols nor the Monkees ever should.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is the greatest CD I have EVER heard.  Being 19, I had no idea who Joni Mitchell was.  Then I happened to catch a PBS special on her.  I remember thinking she was a unique singer &amp; that I recognized a song from &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and one from a TV commercial, and they'd stood out in my mind as really great.  So I got the CD just to try it out.  Then I took it home and was instantly mesmerized and shocked that someone could sing like that.  &quot;River&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Case of You&quot; in particular stand out and literally make me cry (the other songs are just as powerful). And her lyrics are always just so raw.  She actually got told not to be so personal in her songs by close friends who knew her.  But that's what makes this record so special...you can hear the pain and the sadness in not only the lyrics, but Joni's voice...and it makes you feel so much more when you listen to them, than just the typical reaction to most songs today.  You're more able to relate and get into the song when you can actually FEEL the emotion behind it. I just can't believe there are so many people my age missing out on one of the greatest singer/songwriters ever to live.  I'd rate this CD better even than Carly or Paul Simon's greatest work.
0385509456|5.0|&quot;This is a murder-mystery novel&quot;, we are told by our narrator, Christopher Boone. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism. He loves maths, lists, order, timetables, patterns, and the truth. He cannot even comprehend how to tell a lie. He also likes the colour red, but he hates yellow and brown, and being touched.<br />One morning, Christopher finds a neighbours dog killed on their front lawn, a garden fork sticking out of its chest, and he vows to discover the truth. And it is a truth that will turn his fragile world entirely on its head. <BR> <BR>There's not a great deal to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said. It marks the debut of an incredibly talented and insightful author, who is able to move and inspire awkward laughter at the same times. <br />The unfailingly logical Christopher is a brilliant narrator, a wonderful character who will, I assure you, inspire deep feelings in all who share his company through this. And, as the book turns from a deceptively simple &quot;murder-mystery&quot; into a catalogue of events that will have very wide implications for this boy, the reader is moved and moved again by Haddon's portrait of a courageous boy coping dissociatedly against all odds with the dramatic shifts in his life.  This is a very funny book, too, as much as a touching and moving one. I found myself laughing out loud, even though I had the uncomfortable feeling that maybe I shouldn't be. <br />This is a unique, one-of-a-kind, special book, the like of which will probably never be seen again. It's the sort of novel that ahs you rationing the chapters out (incidentally, the chapters are headed only with ascending prime numbers! Little touches like this make the book sparkle) to prolong the experience for as long as possible, until eventually you succumb and can torture yourself no more, and you let yourself be carried on to the inexplicably moving (there's that word again. But it applies so well) end. Stunningly insightful, honest, and full of empathy, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a book of rare original quality indeed. You will be less for letting it pass by.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|The movie features great music, including the Modern Lovers &quot;Roadrunner&quot; (The song that starts out 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) You can get the CD: &quot;Modern Lovers&quot; (Import) from Castle Music UK right here on Amazon.com! Do not be fooled by the other Modern Lover CDs, this is the one to get! It was produced by John Cale in 1972 and is the missing link between the Velvets and punk rock. The Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson went on to drum in &quot;The Cars&quot;, and Jerry Harrison went on to play keyboards in &quot;The Talking Heads&quot;.
B0000AUHPK|1.0|This was a very horrible film.  The plot was chopped up and scattered, the characters were not allowed to have any depth, and the claim that the film spans the entire book is only true in that it has basic plot points, but leaves almost everything of substance out in between.  I was not even a huge fan of the novel, but after this film, I would gladly go back and suffer through Bronte's writing than watch this monstrosity.  I am always amazed at how certain directors and screenwriters can get a hold of such wonderful actors (in this case, Finnes and Binoche) and turn them into nothing more than talking manaquins with no personality or depth.  The entire time I was hoping that the two of them would just die already so the film would be over.  How anyone could enjoy this lackluster production is totally beyond me.
1587990717|5.0|As a quick review I have to say that it is on the intuitive/literary side, with the following components:<BR>1) a high committment to skepticism as a way of life (not just trading or statistical inference)<BR>2) a high acceptance of one's wiring as a director of one's actions.<BR>3) insulation from the opinion of otherss
0441009425|5.0|With Revelation Space, Alastair Reynolds' first novel, he aims high and hits the target almost dead on.  It's a rarity these days to find an author capable of combining hard science fiction with good storytelling, but if this book demonstrates anything, it's that Reynolds is just such an author.  And even more impressive, he does it on a grand scale, weaving together events that take place light-years and decades (and even centuries) apart.<br />I won't bother to outline the story here - I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have already done that.  What I will say is that the author places his characters against the backdrop of human existence several centuries from now, when interstellar space has been colonized, trade ships spend decades plying the space between starts, and human beings exist in a variety of forms, from highly modified cybernetic beings to artificial simulations based on brain scans of the dead.  Yet even on such a grand stage, the characters are never lost - Sylveste, Khouri and Volyova are each strong enough to hold their own, and even if you never find yourself caring about them, you will want to keep reading to learn of their fates.<br />The story is well written and very engaging, and despite the fact that it lost some momentum in the middle, I found myself eagerly turning pages to find out what would happen next.  All in all, though this is not quite a perfect sci-fi novel, it comes close - and definitely deserves five stars!  I would recommend it without hesitation to any fan of hard science fiction.
0783240503|4.0|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is very creative and classy.  Anybody who likes some kind of music will at least find one song that they like in this movie.  Even though it seems a children's movie, it is very interesting even to adults.  In this movie, there is never a dull moment.  The narrator keeps you interested for the whole movie.  The costumes in the movie are awesome, very colorful, and creative.  My favorite part of the whole movie was the part where the pharoah acted like Elvis.  Another very creative and catchy song was &quot;Go Go Go Joseph.&quot;  I give this movie 4 stars and think that everybody from adults to children should watch it.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This new release of the Matrix series, is definitely very cool and deep. I noticed that some folks said that there was nothing new or meaningful on the 2nd one. So here it is some cool stuff that still needs to be revealed:<br />1) What does it mean in the end when he was able to stop the sentinels by himself?<br />2)Because Neo was able to save Trinity (even though the architect said he would not) would that mean that he changed the his history ?, or he is just another version and the history will repeat itself and he will just become another version of the program?<br />3) And the guy that shows up lying down in the end, across Neo's bed, is he the &quot;real&quot; world version of Agent Smith?, and if so, what type of powers he would have and what he can do in the real world ?<br />4) Is Zion in actuality a Matrix within the Matrix ?<br />5) The scene where Neo went to meet with the Architect all the monitors in the wall (when the camera gives the first close), are the same monitor types shown on the first Matrix when Neo got first captured by the agents and was sitting down in a cell waiting to meet Agent Smith for the first time..<br />6) Paraphrasing what the Oracle said: If Neo already made the \\"choice\\" and now he only needs to understand it....by understanding his choices would he be able to change anything?<br />As you can see the 2nd matrix movie was not only about fights, and explosions... just .think about it. :-).
B000003S0P|5.0|I discovered Crimson in 1991, when I was rediscovering my prog-rock roots.  I had been buying Crimso albums at the rate of about 1 per year, taking that long to digest their cerebral and dense compositions.  I finally got &quot;Red&quot; in 1996; once I assimilated the music, I realized it was the star jewel in King Crimson's crown.  Robert Fripp plays guitar with an intensity unmatched in the rest of his oeuvre;  Bill Bruford attacks his batterie with ferocious precision; and John Wetton plays and sings with a passion all too lacking in Crimso's somewhat didactic work.  Although I consider the first three songs one of the all-time &quot;perfect album sides,&quot; it's the closing track, &quot;Starless,&quot; that always sends chills down my spine.  No wonder Crimson broke up (for the first of three times) after recording Red.  They knew they could never top it.
B0000029GA|5.0|this is it. this was the album that changed my views on hip hop and music in general. nas is my favorite mc and his work on this record is his best i have ever seen. the lyrics + music are all beautifully done together. buy this album if you ever want to get into nas or hear great hip hop.
B000000WF0|5.0|I admit a strong sentimental attachment for this record.  My wife bought it for me about 6 months before we were married in 1998, and it quickly became the soundtrack to our engagement year.  Sentiment aside, this is one heck of an album.  The opening strains of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; promise greatness, and the rest of the songs don't disappoint - there isn't a duffer in the bunch.  Lead singer Richard Ashcroft's soulful delivery infuses each track with honesty and emotion, achieving almost spiritual heights on songs like &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; &quot;Space and Time&quot; and &quot;The Drugs Don't Work.&quot;  On the harder tracks, like &quot;The Rolling People,&quot; the band rocks with an intensity lacking from Ashcroft's fine but relatively sedate solo albums.
0790731479|4.0|Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<br />  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?
B000002TQV|5.0|My brother gave me this record in early 1998 after hearing how much I liked &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  I was incredibly busy at the time - being engaged and in the process of buying a house - and put it aside.  It actually sat in my closet - unwrapped! - for over a year.  (Talk about sitting on a gold mine!)  Once I &quot;discovered&quot; it, it didn't take long to become one of my all-time favorites.  Although &quot;The Bends&quot; lacks &quot;OK Computer's&quot; ambition and conceptual rigor, it surpasses its successor in every other respect.  Every track on this album tingles with intensity, vitality, and originality.  Although there are no weak tracks, standouts include the wistful beauty of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; the dynamic &quot;My Iron Lung,&quot; and the haunting closing track &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out).&quot;  In my opinion, this is the best rock album of the last 25 years.
B000002IWH|5.0|When was the last time you scored a quality cd?  The kind of cd that would be an essential addition for your collection.  The kind that makes you glad that you purchased it. This one does !!!  With an allstar cast and a genuine effort from each and every artist, this album is stuffed to the max (from start to finish) with songs that will definitely alter your emotions.  Just like the movie, these songs border on the realm of &quot;Spirituality&quot;.  Just listening to it enhances my senses to want more.  Too bad more albums weren't made this way.  This is one soundtrack worth owning !!!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|I am trying to find a song which is in the movie but i don't know what song it is called. it's the part where the kids are learning in class and all you hear is the song but no talking. maybe its bowie or something, but it sounds like the ramones or the who? help me!!! post the answer or something     <BR>PLEASE!!!!
B00007AJF9|4.0|In my viewing of the movie Elizabeth I though that the movie was very interesting and educating at the same time, it was not made to be a documentary. Yet it was still a very good film. Their where some parts in the movie that where tweaked to make it seem more interesting, but it was still a pretty factual film. It showed the very divine moments that stand out well in my mind that what in the early part of her rein over England.  <br /> In the movie Elizabeth it showed England as it was then. It also showed how Elizabeth came in and decided to stay unmarried and rule country, and prove that to everyone else at the same time. A stand out part which was the closing of the film is when they showed Elizabeth making her final stand saying she was going to stay unmarried by cutting all of her hair off, in a buzz cut. That was a very powerful and moving scene to end the movie on. That particular scene showed Elizabeth's massive amount of courage and strength, to prove to England she will not be married and forever remain the virgin queen.
B000002HD5|5.0|Ten years after it's release date, I come back to the album &quot;Gentleman&quot; by the Afghan Whigs and I'm amazed all over again. The Whigs have blazed their own musical path and make absolutely no apologies to those left behind. It's a rip-roaring ride through the world of Greg Dulli (singer/songwriter), leaving me breathless from start to finish. To this day the album sounds as crisp and fresh as the day it was released; the term &quot;timeless&quot; doesn't do it justice.<br />&quot;Gentleman&quot; is one of those few albums that really comes alive if you listen to it from beginning to end, as you find some tracks lead into one another. One could elaborate on each track individually but in this reviewers opinion, each track is a part of one brilliant, cohesive whole.<br />I struggle for words when it comes to describing the Whigs own unique style of music. There's blues, jazz, soul and rock roots in almost every chord... it all adds up to one incredible musical experience led by Greg Dulli's rough, passionate vocals. It's just simply The Whigs; there are no other bands whose sound is comparable.<br />Buy this album while you still can -- it's worth every penny.
B00005JKC3|4.0|If you bought into the all the hype that was put into promoting this film, Hulk is not a film for you to see.  But if you can remove that terrible ad campaign from your mind, you'll find a really dark and interesting film that is brilliant in story-telling, cinematically wonderful, and probably the one Marvel movie that is truest to the comic book.  Like all of the Marvel flicks (Spider-man, X-Men) it took a lot of liberties with the characters.  But The Hulk stays true to the concept of the comic:  a normal guy forced to deal with a side of himself that expresses immense anger.  I watched the movie trailers and and saw all of the advertising and The Hulk was promoted to be a summer block-buster action flick.  But it's not.  It relies heavily upon story-telling and a lot of it takes you into the mind and trauma of Banner.  As a director and editor I found the directing and editing to be awesome.  A lot of scenes were cut to resemble a comic book page with several panels of action appearing at once for different characters.  The transitions were really cool and I think George Lucas could learn a thing or two from watching them.  And the acting was superb.  Great film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hated this show when it first started. Actually I didn't watch it until the 3rd episode and immediately fell in love. This is honestly the best show to come out in years. My friday nights completely revolved around this show. I was almost in tears when I heard it was cancelled. At least now I can watch it on Fridays like the days of old.
038572179X|5.0|Here's how I can best illustrate the feeling of reading this book:  imagine Game 7 of the World Series, top of the ninth, the home team up by a run, bases loaded, the count is 3-2 to the hitter at the plate.  Everyone is waiting for that last pitch to decide the game one way or another.  The pitcher gets ready to throw, the crowd holds its breath...and the pitcher throws to first base.  Then he walks around the mound to gather his thoughts, has a meeting with the catcher, gathers his thoughts again, shakes off a few signs, and then just as the crowd can take no more, he rears back and gets that last strike and the crowd goes wild.<br />McEwan is like that pitcher on the mound--so slow and deliberate with the first part of the book that it's like Chinese water torture.  The night when everything changes in Briony's life unfolds so slowly that any reader who isn't patient is going to get tired of the book before it really hits its stride.  I had to force myself to keep going on faith alone that it was going to get better, that things would start HAPPENING soon, that all this Victorianesque society garbage (where the high drama is what to wear and whether or not to cook a roast on a hot day) would be worth it.<br />And like the pitcher in my analogy, it is worth it when McEwan throws a perfect strike.  The writing is solid, the important characters are well-described and have real flaws, and once it gets going there's the drama pulling me in.  I always wanted to know what would happen next.  What would happen to Robbie and Cecelia and Briony?<br />What really got to me was the end.  I won't spoil it for readers, but it was so touching that I almost cried.  As someone who writes, I can see a lot of Briony in myself and my own work, and her thoughts about writing at the end really gave me pause to take a good look at myself and what I'm doing.  The end took me so by surprise and was so satisfying, that I can easily look past any small flaws with this book and give it the five stars it deserves.<br />If you can get through the first 150 or so pages, the rest is worth it.  Don't take my word for it, find out for yourself.  You'll be glad you did.<br />As a little aside, I have to say I'm surprised this book did not win more awards.  I read many recent Pulitzer winners like &quot;Middlesex&quot;, &quot;Empire Falls&quot;, and &quot;Kavalier and Clay&quot;, but none of them satisfied me on such an intellectual and emotional level.  If you wanted to go find my reviews of all those (which you don't), you'd see that all of them, while great books, had minor problems that couldn't be overlooked.  Other than the slow beginning, however, &quot;Atonement&quot; has no real problems for me in its plot or writing style.  If my opinion mattered for anything (which it doesn't), I would have given it a Pulitzer without question.five stars it deserves.<br />If you can get through the first 150 or so pages, the rest is worth it.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|I saw Kill Bill last night, and the movie directed by Quentin Tarantino was a modern masterpiece. The visual effects were awesome, and the way that the story played out was unbelievable. But something aside from those aspects was the music, which grabbed me and wouldn't let go. There were so many varieties on the soundtrack, from techno-pumpin themes, to punk music, to quiet flute harmonies. Some of the music was even done by Wu Tang Clan's RZA, and he did an exceptional job on orchestral pieces for a rap artist. No rap artist has done this well on a soundtrack since Eminem did on the 8 Mile soundtrack, which is another terrific soundtrack. The best song on the album is Nancy Sinatra's contribution, played at the vey beginning of the movie. It has an edgy, soft rock sound to it, and I loved it. Overall, I absolutely loved the soundtrack, and even if you haven't seen the movie, you should still think about getting it. But for any fan of the terrific movie, Kill Bill Vol. 1, this is a must-have item!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|The jet album is a fast driving rage up crazy adventure from start to finish.  A must have for every music fan. Jet sticks to their roots and brings their own elements to the game.  This isnt that crappy degraded punk nonsense this is MUSIC!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is great. The characterization is very detailed and the relationships between each of them has real depth. Not unlike the series Farscape, these characters don't all start out liking eachother, but over time a sense of loyalty and friendship does grow until they're like a family. Plotwise-there are frequently moments where you think you know where the story is going, you know the good old tried and true Sci Fi storylines only to have them surprisingly hang an unexpected right hand turn down a different pathway. Firefly is also filled with great dialogue, classic Joss Whedon wit. Not to mention the DVD's are packed with extras.  <br />Favorite episodes? There are so many it's too hard to pick.  Out of Gas is amazingly well written--The Captain, Mal, is shot and he flashes back to his first meeting with many of the crew as he tries to save the ship. Safe and Ariel is where we see some of why Simon is so loyal to his sister, River, who was tortured by the cruel Alliance and what desperate lengths he will go to in order to protect her. Objects in Space, is where a mercenary hunts the crew, spouting humorous non-stop observations about them as he goes.  Shindig, is where Mal hints that he has feelings for Inara and challenges another man to a duel over her. Jaynestown--turns out there's a whole town that sings Jayne's praises...er...literally. War Stories, where Wash (Serenity's pilot) decides there's no time like the present to give Mal a piece of his mind course \\"the present\\" happens to be while they're being held prisoner by a ruthless interrogator. Then again there's always the 2 hour pilot, Serenity, where you first meet the characters and realize that not everyone is as they seem and that once you're apart of Mal's crew you're a member of his family. <br />If you liked Farscape, Stargate, or Buffy with their sense of continuity, banter, and wonderful friendships you'll love this series. Definitely give it a try.
B00007KWHN|4.0|For those of us youngsters who heard the first two albums and thought &quot;what strange ideas these guys have&quot; this offering was a delightful promise fulfilled.  Keep in mind that the whole jazz-rock fusion thing was in its infancy at the time and many of us wondered if Yes was going to venture off into the &quot;jazz&quot; side of that genre and away from the &quot;rock&quot; side.  Obviously, &quot;rock&quot; won.  This album burst onto thousands of college turntables within a short time of its release and quickly became a must-have LP for good reason.  Gone were the hit-and-miss orchestrations of the first two LPs, replaced by the hair-raising guitar runs of Steve Howe and the in-your-face rythms of Chris and Bill.  &quot;Who is this guy?&quot; was the question on every would-be guitar guru's lips for months after the sounds of this album first began to waft through dormitory hallways across the nation.  While not as polished and amazing as &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; would be years later, this collection of songs shows the true birth of the enthusiasm and daring that became their signature sound.
B00005JMCN|5.0|The term \\"feel-good movie\\" is, like \\"popcorn flick\\" and \\"chick flick,\\" one of those sweeping and usually inaccurate generalizations that are used to color any number of superficially similar films.  If the definition is stretched broadly enough, \\"feel-good\\" can be used to describe anything from Chariots of Fire to My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  In the summer of 2003, however, there were two movies for which \\"feel-good\\" was both accurate and complimentary.  One was Bend it Like Beckham.  The other was Seabiscuit.<br />For those not familiar with the story, Seabiscuit was a famous racehorse of the Depression era, competing between 1936 and 1940.  His career is chronicled in the marvelous book Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand.  Hillenbrand's lengthy, detail-rich narrative is, like many great books, too complex to transfer note for note to film, but writer-director Gary Ross takes on the formidable challenge of bringing Seabiscuit's tale to life on the big screen.  Ross wisely chooses to follow Hillenbrand's lead, building the story around the three men who respectively owned, trained, and raced the horse: wealthy auto salesman Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), cowboy Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire).  Ross makes shrewd choices about which details and characters to delete, which events to compress or eliminate altogether, and which aspects of the story to highlight.  The result is a wonderful character-driven drama, a story about the power of friendship, love, hope, courage, and never giving up.<br />Ross takes his leisurely time introducing the three men.  Seabiscuit himself doesn't even make an appearance until about an hour into the movie, and when he does, he's the catalyst that brings the trio together; the trials and triumphs they experience are all the more satisfying because the viewer understands each character's history.  In the process of rebuilding this broken-down racehorse and making him a champion, the three men, each wounded in his own way, also heal each other and mend their broken lives.  Inadvertently, they provide millions of Americans with an unlikely cultural icon, an underdog hero who gives ordinary people a badly-needed dose of hope.<br />The story, with its ups, downs, and amazing comeback, might seem mere Hollywood contrivance were it not based on actual events.  Even the most casual moviegoer pretty much knows how the tale will end, but that doesn't diminish the enjoyment of it in the least.  The tone of the film helps sell its credibility: warmly sentimental without being saccharine or manipulative, funny without being crude or cynical, beautiful without being artsy or pretentious.  The tragic moments are doubly powerful because they're filmed with an eloquent understatement.  Ross employs a wonderful visual shorthand, conveying just as much in images--if not more so--than he does in dialogue.  He delivers a lot of the film's humor with the same technique: abundant one-liners and quick reaction shots produce any number of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments.<br />The cast is uniformly outstanding.  Bridges gives a terrific performance; he makes Howard warm and charming and fatherly and likeable, a great guy with a big heart.  Cooper's role as Smith is smaller, but he hits exactly the right notes as a survivor of America's vanishing frontier, a man more comfortable with horses than with people.  But the undisputed star of the show is Maguire, who is simply luminous as Pollard--as well he should be; the jockey's role was written specifically for him.  Pollard has been wounded more deeply and more often then the other two leads, and perhaps for this reason, the viewer's heart goes out to him the most strongly: he's angry and vulnerable, scarred physically and psychologically, but funny and likable and literate, all at the same time.  Maguire develops the character beautifully as the movie progresses; the viewer sees Pollard slowly let down his barriers and make connections with his new surrogate family.<br />As wonderful as each performances is, the chemistry that the actors have together is even more notable.  It's true ensemble acting; the cast as a whole adds up to more than the sum of its individual players.  The supporting folks are also terrific.  Elizabeth Banks gives a strong turn as Howard's warm and supportive second wife, Marcela; real-life jockey Gary Stevens makes a confident acting debut as legendary rider George Woolf; and William H. Macy is hilarious as fictional radio personality \\"Tick Tock\\" McGlaughlin, who provides much of the movie's humor.<br />Of course, this is also a movie about horse racing, and Ross doesn't disappoint.  The races are filmed with an intimate excitement that conveys the beauty, pulse-pounding exhilaration, and sometimes brutality of thoroughbred racing.  However, unlike many action movies, the racing sequences never take over the story; they are all the more breathtaking because the viewer knows and cares about the characters who are pouring their lives into these glorious animals.<br />Visually, the movie is a feast.  The 1930s are re-created fabulously, from the cars and towns and trains to the characters' smart suits and hats to the wonderful old racetracks.  The widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the lovely score by Randy Newman infuses the movie with equal measures of beauty, humor, and nostalgia.<br />The main complaint critics have leveled at the film center around the use of voice-over narration (handled ably by historian David McCullough) and archival photographs to provide some historical context for the story.  This was a risky choice artistically, but it enables Ross to convey the social forces at work in Seabiscuit's world without taking awkward detours in plot and character development.  For the most part, the narration is used sparingly and in the right places.  A couple of the later sequences could probably have been trimmed out, but they hardly ruin the movie.  <br />Probably the only mis-step Ross makes is drawing too many overt parallels between the rebuilding of the racehorse and the rebuilding of the nation via Roosevelt's New Deal.  Ross makes it fully clear in the story that Seabiscuit had become a symbol of hope; he didn't need to use the narrative sequences to hammer this point in quite so strongly.  Sixty thousand people pouring into a racetrack to watch a horse run for two minutes is testament enough to the affection that Seabiscuit inspired.  But even here, Ross isn't too far off the mark: the New Deal may have provided jobs, but Seabiscuit gave people something intangible: the belief that they, too, could overcome the odds and triumph over adversity.<br />Although best seen on a big screen, the DVD will no doubt be chock-full of extra goodies.  In the theater or at home, viewers can be assured their money will be well-spent: Seabiscuit is a movie that satisfies on pretty much every level.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Despite all the hype, the glowing reviews, and multiple listens, I find this to be an average &quot;album&quot; with only two or three above average songs to carry the load.
B000002HJR|5.0|This record is full of what so many others lack: Soul. Wrung into the vocals. Wrenched out of the guitars. Pounded into your chest by the rhythm section. You can feel every heartache and defeat, every triumph and every loss, spoken and unspoken, in this piece of work. There isn't one weak track on the entire album, from the opening hook of &quot;Temptation's Wings&quot; to the haunting psycadelic-blues of &quot;Jail&quot; to the utterly sludgy doomfest of &quot;Bury Me In Smoke&quot;. Rock and Roll will save your soul, and DOWN are keeping the faith.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie ever made (next to Gigli). It has absolutely no plot and every other scene has the women dancing to some stupid song or an action sequence with music blaring.<br />I cant believe I even spent my money on a matinee on this garbage. If you are under the age of 20 this movie will appeal to you because your brains are still trying to develop and you have no concept of what's right and wrong. This movie is definitely wrong and a waste of time and money.
B000056BOR|5.0|&quot;That Touch of Mink,&quot; directed by Delbert Mann, is a delicious 60's sex comedy about the romantic duel between Cathy Timberlake (played by Doris Day), an unemployed working girl with small-town roots, and Philip Shane (Cary Grant), a rich businessman.  Along for the ride are Audrey Meadows as Cathy's fiercely protective roommate Connie and Gig Young as Philip's wisecracking employee Roger.<br />&quot;That Touch&quot; is absolutely hilarious and delightful from start to finish.  Day is irresistible--wholesome and innocent, yet feisty.  Grant is charming and funny.  Meadows and Young get lots of comic mileage out of their marvelous supporting roles.<br />The film is also a joy to look out.  The sets and costumes are marvelous (there's even a fashion show); the screen bursts with color.  The script combines witty dialogue, zesty social satire and goofy physical comedy with a cleverly structured plot.  There are also some fun cameos by recognizable faces--I won't spoil the fun by revealing them.  And it's all nicely complemented by a playful musical score.  &quot;That Touch&quot; is one comic battle of the sexes that really holds up after all these years.
1400049628|4.0|this book occupied me for awhile. it is hilarious. anyone who likes zombie movies needs it.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I am crestfallen. First, let me say this. I have been reading comics (mostly Marvel) since I was twelve. I liked Blade 1 & 2, I liked X-Men & Daredevil. X-Men 2 and Spiderman were awesome. So all in all I have been satisfied with Marvel's films for the past few years.<BR>...Not only was HULK the worst of any Marvel Film I have ever seen (including the old Captain America and old Punisher), but I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life...<)(...)rst.<BR>1.) It was boring and slow.<BR>2.) Ang Lee tried to make it look like a comic with all these boxes and panels and stuff<BR>3.) They should have called the movie \\"Close-Up of Nick Nolte's Face While He Talks Slowly\\"... opening June 20. That guy got more screen time than anybody.<BR>4.) Close-Up's of lizards and trees, way too much of.....<BR>5.) Not enough HULK smashing...way too much HULK jumping. I thought I was watching Jump-Man.<BR>6.) Too much Nick Nolte...did I mention that?<BR>7.) Betty Ross and Bruce Banner walking around moping and whining. It's characterization, I know. But this was overkill and it still didn't make them any more likable!<BR>8.) No hidden \\"cool\\" things for comic fans. Like a name, place, or event reference. Well, maybe there was. But I was half asleep late into the movie.<BR>9.) Not even the tiniest sense of humor or levity. I don't want (...) Shakespeare, I want the Hulk to smash things.<BR>10.) The ending, all of it. Everything was dumb.<br />Now, I have never seen another Ang Lee movie, but this guy managed to make a movie about The Incredible Hulk boring...(...)<BR>(...) <BR>....Now there were two good things in the movie. <br />1.) San Elliot as General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross. He was awesome. He hated Banner and Hulk. Very good portrayal and true to the comic.<BR>2.) The Hulk interacting with Betty Ross. The special effects looked good and made the Hulk have emotion. Too bad this only happened for 18 seconds out of a two and ahalf hour long movie. Which is a half hour longer than it should have been(...)<BR>3.) This movie (...) hard.<br />(...). I also had to go get some Hulk back issues to assure myself it was Ang Lee who (...), and not the Hulk.
B00005JLK1|2.0|Well ... this is the second movie that Steve Beck has made for Dark Castle Pictures, the first being the god-awful 13 Ghosts remake, and I have to say he's getting better.  You CAN actually see him progressing as a director.<br />Don't get me wrong it's still not a very good movie, but it's not like there isn't improvement.  Beck is working with a much better cast this time out, the story isn't quite as ridiculous as '13 Ghosts' was, and Beck does a credible job generating some spooky moments and tension.<br />&quot;Not Terrible&quot; is probably the best stamp I could put on it.  I'm not sure I could recommend buying a copy, but you could probably rent it without feeling ripped-off.
B00009P1O5|5.0|One of my favorite Neil albums (along with On the Beach) reissued.  While not necessarily his greatest lyrics, the theme SERENITY runs throughout.  Crazy Horse rocks hard and loud, more so than anything else between Live Rust and Ragged Glory.  Often lumped in with horrible &quot;Life&quot; album, this is NY&amp;CH at some of their best.
079073639X|1.0|It's horrible that they pumped so much effort into the budget of this movie, hired a terrific cast, promoted it like crazy, and never thought to do something as little as write the script.<br />I've never seen a cast with so much talent be wasted so completely just because there was nothing for them to do.  I remember watching a scene where Samuel L. Jackson was reading, I was so bored I was actually envious that he had something to flip through ...<br />Don't waste your time with this.  If you really want to see it that bad, make sure you at least rent it first; and if you do, don't forget a magazine to keep you busy with.
B00005OM4N|3.0|This is not Britney's best album by far. But I will give her credit for cowriting five songs at the least bit. The album is good in general. But it is not her best. I do appreciate the hip hop tunes. My ratings for each song:<br />1. I'm a slave 4 u- Good beat, nice, and catchy. Her vocals are nice, and breathy.<br />2. Overprotected- This is the perfect song for her. fits right in with her description. I love this song. Great beat.<br />3. Lonely- Sounds like a Janet Jackson tune. But I do appreciate the fact that she wrote it. Her vocals sound very nice on the track.<br />4. Not a girl, not yet a woman- This is a great song. This is the song where Brit is getting down, and very personal. She is also using her natural voice on this one. Well of course. After all, it is a ballad.:-)<br />5. Boys- I like this song. But it is not all that. It's nice, and catchy.<br />6. Anticipating- Another great song. Her voice sounds so good on this joint. Plus she cowrote it. Woo hoo!<br />7. I love rock n roll- Cool song. I don't have much to say about it. Her cover of the Rollingstones &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a much better remake.<br />8. Cinderella- Great song right here. I loooves this song sooo much. Another one she helped to write!<br />9. Let me be- Nice beat. Nice, and catchy. Another song she cowrote.<br />10. Bombastic love- Loooves this song too! Nice, and poppy!<br />11. That's where you take me- cowritten for Justin. I love this song. Her voice is so pretty in it.<br />12. What it's like to be me- Great song! Cowritten and produced by Justin T and Wade Robson.<br />Well, there it is. My awesome review of Brit's last album (Britney). Enjoy it!
B000001C6M|5.0|Being a metal fan for years, getting into Metallica, Megadeth, and Iron Maiden at first, it was only natural that I would discover Slayer. I was never big on Slayer's iamge and lyrics, so I steered clear of them for asome time, but I eventually gave them a try. I, like most people getting tinto Slayer, started off with the albums Reign In Blood and Seasons iN The Abyss. i was amazed by their guitar musicianship! These guys were good! After that I decided to give their debut album at ry. I was blown away. Again, I wasn't big on their lyrics, buut the guitar work was awsome! Show No Mercy's guitars aren't quite as thrashy sounding as on latter albums. On this album the guitars sound more crisp and clear. CHeck out the intro to The Antichrist, its absolutly amazing, and the intro Metal STorm to the song Face the Slayer is mind bending. The songs Die By THe Sword and Tormentor almost make me cry with happiness. These guys were great even in their early days. And Tom's voice is superb here! He souns so youthful, and his voice is crisp an dhe can get thosee screams out perfectly! It's a shame that his voice has really given out lately. His voice, especially on Slayer's last three albums, has showed major wear. I have heard all of Slayer's albums and I can easily say that SHow No Mercy is one of their best! Even if your weary of trying Slayer because of their extreme image and lyrical use (as I am even today), give htem a try because their guitar musicianship! I can't stress how good Kerry King and crew are at this! They are definitly one of the best in the metal genre!
B00005JLXE|5.0|15 years ago I used to read every MARVEL/DC comic book I could buy,and one my favorites was the DAREDEVIL.I have watched this movie 3 times - and the more I watch the better I think it is . Daredevil has incredible stunts and fine CG effects.The fights are cool and the characters are very interesting.Some people say FRANK MILLER should have written the script / directed it ,but they keep forgetting that ROBOCOP 2 &amp; 3 stories were penned by him.I like these ROBOCOP films whereas  critics and most movie watchers hate them.So,I'd say DAREDEVIL is a nice film because Miller's &amp; MARVEL's vision is there - the essence was preserved.Ben Affleck did a great job and deserves to come back,as well as C. Farrell, Duncan ,J. Garner and the original cast and crew.Perhaps a story which tells of Elektra's mysterious life and her training in the East,her involvement with a criminal organization ( If I am not wrong it is called the Tentacle ) ,master/sensei Stick,Kirigi ( the zombie/living dead ninja ),the Beast (from the GRAPHIC NOVEL) , and even the participation of  criminals like Mary Typhoid,Stilts,...could certainly make a good story.The double DVD is filled with documentaries,screen tests,featurettes,3 videoclips,enhanced viewing mode,interviews with the best MARVEL writers,pencilers ,etc... - one of the best DVD sets  ever launched.If you like superheroes,sci-fi,action ,adventure ,then this is the movie for you.I am looking forward to part 2.
0385504209|5.0|I read this book over the course of a 48 hour period and have bought 2 copies as Christmas gifts.  It provides a very fast, exciting read that keeps the reader breathless.  What I really liked about it were the many nuggets of historical information that the world needs to know about.<br />P.S. Contrary to the opinions expressed in some of the above book reviews, the Internet is not a reliable tool for verifying the author's research.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty was one of the first Disney animated films I remember my folks taking me to see.  As a child during my `dinosaur' phase, I loved watching Maleficent turn into the dragon and fight Phillip. The story, you should know by now of course, young princess whisked away by three fairy `godmothers' to protect her from evil sorceress, raised in the forest unaware of her heritage, meets prince charming unaware he's a prince, eventually finds out they're betrothed to each other as prince fights sorceress.  The re-mastering technique employed on this DVD yielded incredible results, the image was actually more vibrant and colorful than originally aired in 1959 and it looks marvelous on today's widescreen HDTVs.  I was quite taken with the art, quite unlike anything Disney has done before or since with it's angular geometry and perpendicular themes.  Aurora and Maleficent duel for most beautiful Disney female forms to date.  The extras on the DVD are quite interesting as well.  The original theatrical companion pieces The Grand Canyon was sublime and the snippet of how four artists paint a tree helped glean a bit into the mindset of the brilliant artists on the Sleeping Beauty project.  Highly recommended, not just as a child's story, but as an impressive art piece and study of mood and texture.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This film was a very intense 2 hours of jumping and gasping. It is based on the popular video game series, but you don't have to have burned corneas or sore thumbs to enjoy this modern and believable zombie flick. For those who haven't played the game, Resident Evil was a spooky game to play alone and in the dark. The film is no exceeption.<BR> In short, a biological weapons manufacturer/gene tampering company has an accidental release in their facility and has been locked down, containing but killing the entire staff. The government funded security team comes to check it out and are shall we say surprised. Oh yeah, did I mention they were 200 feet underground?<BR> The cast did an excellent job and the director was true enough to the games to make any gamer happy. I also suggest to watch it with the commentary the second watch. You hear how intense the set and atmosphere was for the actors to work in. Also guys, you hear the &quot;real&quot; to life Milla and Michelle talk about a bar they &quot;visited&quot; on location. Something about underwear only?????<BR> If anyone is interested in a good scare Resident Evil is a good choice. Lots of blood,gore,and sexy women with automatic weapons.<BR>Does it get any better.....yes the women actually aren't stupid morons like in most horror films. They are the heros not the victims.

B00008BXJF|5.0|King Crimson no deja de sorprenderme, despues de mas de 30 aos siguen siendo igual de vanguardistas, propositivos y progresivos, considero que crimson es la banda progresiva por exelencia.en fin, este disco vale la pena, es mucho mejor que construktion of light y esta al nivel de discos como &quot;in the court of the crimson king&quot; o &quot;red&quot;. en este disco tanto las canciones instrumentales como las que contienen letra son increibles. y dan una muestra a bandas como korn, linkin park y a toda la gran mayoria del nu metal lo que es hacer un buen metal, todas las canciones tienen algo que se hacen distinguir. lo mejor para mi gusto es &quot;signs of life&quot; y &quot;dangerous courves&quot;, en  mi opinion el que mas resalta de los 4 virtuosos es trey gunn, q es un mounstro con su warr guitar, sin demeritar porsupuesto al maestro fripp, ni a belew q esta inmejorable ni al exelente y unico mastelotto
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If I could give this album 5,000 stars, I would.  I bought it the day it came out and it has left my CD player (literally) only to be placed in my portable walkman.  Everyone in the band are musical geniuses.  Buy this album, people.  If you liked Mer De Noms, you will NOT be disappointed.
B000002VBY|3.0|A decent release of this Swiss (my compatriots) heavy metal band. They remind me of AC/DC, and in their finest moments rival them. But often the playing is too fast! I recommend Axel Rudi Pell. He's just as heavy but replaces speed by skill. As to melody behind the shredding both Krokus and AC/DC can't compete.
B00009V7RF|3.0|I was on the going crazy when I heard their song &quot;hey mama&quot; on the IPod Commercial. I think that's the hottest track, I usually don't like my reggae mixed with hip hop but I think they pulled it off. My second favorite is &quot;shut up&quot; real nice vibes. BUT, these guys have a song on here called &quot;let's get retarded!!!!!! WHAT!!! I don't care in what shape or form you express yourself as an artist...I think this was being just plain insensitive to those of who are different.
1572703296|5.0|It's a pleasure to hear E.M. Forster's A Passage To India brought to life under the studied British accent of Sam Dastor: it offers a fine performance which brings to life the story of Adela Quested, who arrives in India prepared to marry a British magistrate and soon finds an attraction in a doctor who offers to show her the 'real' India. Her involvement with him will change her life and end the British rule in India in this lively classic which is pure audio pleasure.
B00004XONN|5.0|Although not my favorite Radiohead album (OK Computer wins that title), Kid A is probably the most innovative and unique album by them.  Some might say that the mainly techno/electronica songbase is &quot;not real rock&quot; or &quot;too soft&quot; but Radiohead didn't make this album to be accepted as a rock classic, they made it to be a beautiful, experimental, different and amazing set of musical soundscapes.  Each song has so many layers to it, with gentle keyboards, great drumming, and beautiful, breathtaking vocals by Thom Yorke.  This album isn't completely lacking rock elements though.  Amazing guitar from Johnny Greenwood can be heard in songs like &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; and Colin Greenwood's throbbing bassline in &quot;The National Anthem&quot; is extremely catchy and upbeat.  Although my favorite kind of music is Hard Rock/Metal, this album is still one of my favorites because I listened to it with an open mind and accepted it for the beautiful masterpiece it really is.
0385504209|4.0|Robert Langdon is a scholar who is awakened in his hotel room one night by the Paris police.  When he goes with the authorities to a murder scene, he's pretty upset about it.  Apparently, the docent for the Louvre Museum has been murdered.  And Mr. Langdon was supposed to have met up with the murder victim several hours prior to his death.  But he says he never did.  Does the investigating detective believe him?<br />Sophie Neuveu is a cryptologist who works for the Paris police.  She gets 'called' into action when it is discovered that the murder victim left a strange message scrawled on the floor of the Museum.  She's also related to someone very involved in this murder case.  Whoa!<br />Mr. Teabing is a Grail enthusiast who has more money than God.  He's been trying to find out the truth behind the Holy Grail and a secret society whom he has discovered was designed to protect it: The Priory of Scion.  This group had some prestigious names affiliated with it too. Leonardo Da Vinci, Gallileo, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and a slew of other historically famous people.<br />Silas is an albino who works for a section of the church known as the Opus Dei.  He's a hit-man with a serious job to do.  If anyone ever found out what the Holy Grail really was and what it represented, the Christian faith might crumble into ruin.  That can't happen.  So Silas is sent out into the world to make sure it doesn't.  He gets his assignments from someone called &quot;The Teacher.&quot;  An invisible person to all except for one person.

0375410341|5.0|House of leaves is a book I put off reading for a long time because I thought that it was not worth my time. When I saw the cover of the book and I saw that people were relating the writers work to Stephen King I thought that this book was going to be a very plain pointless novel that would have no effect on me and that I would forget in a few weeks.<BR>Well, I started reading it anyway because every once in a while those pointless novels are fun to read. But I was surprised when I started the work just to see how original it was, this is not a regular old novel you're reading here. This is a work of art! For that reason, I thought, this piece of work would be a memorable one for me. Not one that I would forget in a few weeks like I had thought. When I continued reading the book I realized that this book is a very intelligent and thought provoking book. And now looking back at the book I see that it has become one of my favorite books for many reasons. It combines suspense, originality and thought provoking ideas and creates one of the most shocking and ground-breaking pieces of work in the history of literature.<BR>That is a lot to say, I must admit, but it is not untrue. This piece of art (you can't even call it a novel! That would be very unfair) is amazing. You will be scared out of your mind in some moments of the novel, but you will not be able to put the book down. The book can be seen in a number of different ways concerning the philosophy, but I saw it as an existentialist piece of work. I don't feel I need to give you a plot summary because you can get that from other reviews.<br />I don't recommend buying this book in paperback because it has a lot of pages, and it might get ruined by a reckless reader. I am quite sure that once you've read it, you will probably end up buying it in Hardcover anyway because it is such a good book. I also recommend investing in a signed or first edition of this book, it will be worth a lot of money some day. <br />If you liked this book and are looking for more writers, I recommend Chuck Palahniuk if you have not read him. His books do not live up to, \\"The House Of Leaves\\" but they are very thought provoking and original as well.<br />Now I will rate the book from a scale of A-F as I do in my reviews for books:<br />Characters: B<BR>Plot: A<BR>Thought Provoking: A<BR>Suspense: A<br />With an overall grade of an A, this book is definitely one that will live on a hundred years from now, and it is one that I will reread sometime.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The music so truly fits the film,(a true Tarantino film quality) which is visually amazing. What is the most spectacular song is Battle Without Honor or Humanity, so dead solid perfect for this film.
B000002GQE|5.0|It's probably unfair to try to categorize the Moody Blues.  They weren't quite prog rock, but they sure weren't blues or pop, either.  They have a unique voice and place in music from a time when heartfelt lyrics had real feeling for all of us.
B000059PR5|5.0|I was born in the year 1983 and I always remembered hearing my mom talk about this movie that came on tv 3 days before I was born.  It was called &quot;The Day After&quot;.  I finaly saw this film and was completely amazed at the images on screen.  I'm a big B grade horror movie fan, particularly overly gory zombie movies.  As I was watching &quot;The Day After&quot;  It struck me that the survivors were nothing more than decaying undead straight out of &quot;Dawn of The Dead&quot;.  This movie really made me think.  I am an infantryman in the Marine corps and the whole prospect of being torn between duty and family in a situation such as really hit home.
B00003CXB2|4.0|It's certainly not history and you shouldn't change your life after watching it, but the filming and score and acting are so indelible that it's easy to see why so many viewers are touched for years by this excellent motion picture.  If you have to by a film for a gift or to watch on a slow evening, this is the one - if you don't already have Casablanca, of course.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Anticipation was high last year around Christmas time for Martin Scorsese's new epic Gangs of New York.  It was over-budget, had numerous problems on set and was supposed to be a brilliant epic motion picture.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver all of the goods, but its a great joy to watch him try.  The film captures perfectly the time period of Civil War era with sets costumes and character actors.  The plot starts out good enough: orphan seeks revenge on the man who killed his father.  But, in the film's difficult middle section, the plot languishes and becomes tedious to watch.  However, the film's last 45 minutes or so bring back the starting intesity and it makes for a good ending.  The problem is basically that in the middle of the film the characters really have no direction and Cameron Diaz's character seems tacked on and really unecessary to the overall film.  With that complaint concluded, I have to say that it was still a great film.  I saw it in the theatre with my brother, who normally wouldn't be caught dead at more artsy films, and although he lodged the same complaint as I did about the film's middle section, he thought it was a great movie.  <br />The REAL story of Gangs of New York is Daniel Day-Lewis.  He hits all the right notes in his portrayal of the ferocious &quot;Bill the Butcherer.&quot;  The audience comes away both charmed and terrified by this intriguing character.  DiCaprio's performance is good too, but he's overshadowed by Day-Lewis' Bill.  Its kind of like going on stange after the Beatles:  how in the world can follow up something as great as it?  Anyway, I would highly recommend renting Gangs of New York.  Its a great, but flawed, film.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Some of us can't afford cable. SO RELEASE SIX FEET UNDER. I have only seen season 1. Don't you feel sorry for me HBO? You should. You should feel so bad you're gonna release season 2.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Is insane. This is the best movie I've seen all year. Better than X2, even, and that movie owns. If I could, I'd rate this movie a 9.99 out of 10. The only remotely sub-par scene was the Zion rave. THAT'S IT. The rest is awesome. Enjoy it for what it is. You're just mad because you aren't smart enough to come up with something like this trilogy and it's branches (Animatrix, Enter the Matrix). Don't dis this movie. <br />Shimmy <br />P.s.- you guys are scared to post your name? pansies.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I remember Duran Duran from the earlier days of MTV.  They were constant musical acts on MTV, on the dance floor, on pop radio -- they were everywhere.  They got the &quot;honor&quot; of doing a Bond song long before Madonna, the queen of pop in many ways, and they had an international reputation that made their concerts sell-outs around the world.  While their popularity diminished into the 90s, they are still around now and then, and their classic videos (sad to think of them appearing as &quot;classic&quot; videos now, as it means I am getting older) repeat on VH-1 and other outlets to show videos like &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; to be as polished as many of the things being put out today.<br />This is a great disc to have if you want the one-disc collection of all their greatest hits.  However, there are some tracks that are presented here as edited versions -- they aren't always the ones we're used to on the radio or on the videos.  Most people probably won't notice, but for the purists, this could be a bit of a frustration.<br />This is an essential pop collection.  From the high-energy dance tracks like &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; and &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; to the more subdued but still electronic-heavy &quot;Come Undone&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer,&quot; these songs transport those of us who came of age during this time back to a time when videos (and in many ways, the whole world) was a bit flashier and shinier.
B00000JHAU|5.0|Belle and Sebastian are in many ways a complete original and walking to their own beat. If You're Feeling Sinister is their finest effort and one of the greatest albums of all time. At times silly, absurd, and sad but always gentle and funny. The Stars of Track and Field start it off with Stuart Murdoch's sweet gentle voice singing his stories of youth. Seeing Other People begins in a wonderful beat of something straight off Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang and tells stories of young lust with an always present tongue in cheek mantality. Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying sounds sad but is one of the most upbeat tracks on the album and the highlight. The title track is grand and The Boy Done Wrong Again weeps in agony in the words &quot;All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs&quot; and this could be one of them. The album always has a certain cool quality in a dorky kind of way but it never grows old and showcases the Scottish band's talent. As they say in Get Me Away, &quot;Play me a song to set me free / Nobody writes them like they used to / So it may as well be me.&quot; Thanks B&amp;S.
B00006LFGD|1.0|Barbra I hope you read this.I am so tired of you not being a &quot;hungry&quot; artist anymore and it shows. In all the years i have been  following your career ,that last concert where you gouged the public on the price of those seats for whatever reason....you lost me as a true fan and i now look at you as a RUG SALESPERSON.not to say a true carpetman hasn't any integrity. I do not buy anymore of your albums. How dare you recycle this music on this album.i wonder  how many real fans bought it. We all have it. In your interviews where you've said I don't  listen to ANY music(I never listen to mine.I understand that you've worked on it).but not to have music in your life.it says that I'm  in this business for only the  MONEYand not  the artistic payback which is richer than  any greenback<br />what a talent God has given this human and not to use it is a sin..There wasn't ZERO stars or I would have rated it that
B000025XKM|5.0|Drake's Pink Moon is a brilliant example of the beauty of a great songwriter and what he can do with his acoustic guitar and a hint of pain. Regardless of the melancholy tune or his sudden death by an overdose of anti-depression pills, this album is a very enjoyable listen. The title track gets it started with it's simple lyrics and calm delivery. Other highlights include Road, Things Behind the Sun, and the wonderful closer From The Morning. And like that it's over as you wish there was just a little more. We could say more about his shortened career.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The movie started out slow, but that's called for, puzzle pieces here and there... The soundtrack is excellent, Jules and Kelly did a fantastic job meshing the song and the images together at the end, and it was at that moment...
B00003CXZ3|3.0|it was strange going backwards all the time in this movie but it was a greay viewing and Pearce did an excellent job at telling his characters problems. not for everyones taste
B00004Y87O|1.0|I bought this movie because everyone said it was good and better than the second Part (Escape from L.A.). Well all I can say is that its just stupid... <br />The story may be ok but the acting and atmospehre (if it even exists) is just like soem schoolplay of Hamlet. <BR>On top of that it does hardly have any action. There is only 1 scene of &quot;action&quot;: (spoilers) Snake gets chased by some crazy people (?) ,runs into a building and covers up the window he jumped in, than he takes out his Mac11 (with scope on the <BR>supresor -_-) and shoots one guys Hand of wich leaves a bloody mess.<BR>Im sorry to say but if you have seen Escape from LA first than dont watch this...
6304819935|5.0|without a doubt this one is way better than the original. more funny gags and gore galore. the funniest sequence would be at the beginning when Campbell is hit sky high then lands in the puddle and he shakes the demon out of him. then later on hes chased back to the cabin and all threw the house. just great. and the laughing deer head kicks ass too. a must see for anyone
B000001DVD|4.0|you need to go listen to this album when you're driving down a long highway at night<br />-Let It Go: Mid-tempo hard rocker with a pretty good sound to it, but just a bit too generic. A-<br />-Another Hit and Run: good opener<br />-High 'N' Dry: good song<br />-Bringin' on the Heartbreak: haunting song<br />-Switch 625: great instrumental<br />-You Got Me Runnin': excellent<br />-Lady Strange: excellent<br />-On Through the Night: good song<br />-Mirror, Mirror (Look into My Eyes): BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM - play it loud<br />-No No No: sucks
B000089RVR|5.0|If you loved Dido's first CD as much as I did, then you will love her new one.  I find it hard to classify her music - it is romantic and introspective, relaxed without being boring or sappy.  It is true that the style is like &quot;No Angel&quot; - but what's wrong with that?  I think this CD is full of wonderful songs - all of them good.  My personal favorite is track 2 &quot;Stoned&quot;, but listen to the words on the title track &quot;Life for Rent&quot; - I thought the lyrics had a lot of truth in them.  This is a really cool CD, and I highly recommend it!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|An above review stated that Elle Driver's lethal injection tune was not on the soundtrack, and as CDNOW has not yet listed the tracks, I cannot be certain if it is or isn't on the CD.  BUT, if anybody is searching for the tune, I believe it is titled &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; by Bernard Hermann.
0385504209|5.0|This is an excellent thriller.  However, I must warn you, this book can be controversial.  Essentially, the Da Vinci code focuses on the &quot;Grail Legend.&quot;  In reality, this book is an extention of &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail.&quot;<br />The Priory of Sion has an ancient secret about the Merovingian dynasty.  This secret can potentially change history and firmly established religious beliefs.<br />A misguided monk -- thinking he is doing God's work -- murders the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion and his three &quot;Guardians.&quot;  However, the grand Master of this secret society scrolls a message which implicates a American expert on ancient symbols.<br />The American professor, Robert Langdon and the granddaughter of the murdered grand master, travel a dangerous journey to uncover the truth about the Holy Grail.<br />The book is quick reading.  Once you pick it up, you won't put it down.<br />This book has been denounced as anti-Catholic.  This is not even remotely true.  As a matter of fact, this book helps people come to grips with the origins of the Roman Catholic Church.  After reading this book, you will come to the realization that Constantine was actually the &quot;first Pope.&quot;<br />After reading this book, you will see evidence of the &quot;sacred feminine&quot; in the most unlikely places.
B000002N2N|5.0|Pound for pound, this is one of the best live albums ever released. I bought it on import vinyl back in 1979 and it was one of the first CDs I bought upon upgrading my stereo system. The Ramones smoke through their set list like there's no tomorrow. Recorded on New Year's Eve in 1977 at the Rainbow Theatre in London, this set sounds much better (probably because of Tommy's co-producing) then the recently released \\"Ramones - NYC 1978\\" CD which was recorded at The Palladium in New York City just a week later. It also includes \\"Judy Is A Punk\\" which is absent from the NYC show. All in all, a must have CD for any Ramones fan. 2 notes to Tod Nelson : it was Dee Dee (not Joey) who shouted out \\"1,2,3,4!!!\\" before each song and this CD clocks in at just under 54 minutes not 48 (you may have been cheated). R.I.P. Joey, Dee Dee, and Johnny.
6305095566|5.0|though it was low budget it was a hit in its time. the sequel is much better, but this one is great too. Campbell and friends go to a cabin and then strange things happen and his friends get possessed by demons and he has to kill them all. a dynamite ride
B000060MMI|5.0|I'm not a punk kid. Not at all. I'm a metalhead, but I like to keep my ears open for something different. It's getting harder and harder in this Clearchannel MTV world, but these guys are awesome. My friend played this while I was in his car and 2 minutes later I was screaming the chorus to &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; out the window. It's a very unique sound mix of celtic and punk, but it works. It works very very well. I recommend this for anyone with an open mind looking for something original and fun.
B000062YAY|2.0|Now I am sure that, with this kind of title, I'll get plenty of folks willing to mark my review as useless, out of indignation. Please bear with me first. I personally listen to every music style from Black Metal to Goa/Trance, thru Jazz and Classic. To me, there are only two styles of music: good and bad. I've got nothing for or against Trash Metal in particular, and I am reviewing these guys unbiased, based on their purported music style.<br />The singer - Let's start with the lyrics: a pile of garbage. This guy can't sing, and he's not even convincing. If you want something scary, go listen to Dimmu Borgir, for instance (Same satanic theme, but much more believable). I would accept the lyrics much more if these guys at least pretended to believe in what they're singing, if they tried to put on a show. But what to make of that request: &quot;Please guys, let's look out for each other, that's what we're here for&quot; ? Methinks the guys present at the concert wanted more to hear about the End of the World than to care about one another, good christian style. By the way, he can't play his instrument either, but it's okay coz we can hardly hear him anyway.<br />Now the guitarists - they're fast. That's it. Not a single musical hook in their riffs. Their solos are mostly uninspired and sometimes borderline out of key. Don't talk to me about virtuosity, I could play that if I tried hard, and I am not a good guitarist.<br />The real good one here is the drummer, obviously the most ignored musician in that band, if I judge by other reviews. Wrongly so, he definitely lacks in diversity, but at least he has decent chops. What he does, he does well.<br />Some other reviewer said new listeners, used to more recent stuff like Korn, may be put off by how heavy this is. Dude, go listen to Korn another time, they're something else. To compare apples with apples, or trash to trash in this case, I'll say Pantera was ten times better, with a more talented singer, an excellent guitarist, and a rock solid rythm section. And they're heavy, real heavy. Sepultura may be an even closer comparison, with this time even their drummer overshadowing Slayer's.<br />Slayer may have sounded fast, heavy, and scary at the time. They gained fame for some, or all, of these reasons. But metal has become more mainstream nowadays, and everybody has heard bands that were faster, heavier and scarier. So whatever you're looking for, you'll find better elsewhere. Some bands withstand the test of time, others don't. Oftentimes, there's a reason for it.<br />So why 2 stars and not 1? Well at least they're not Cannibal Corpse, and I'll give them a bonus for their drummer.arist, and a rock solid rythm section. And they're heavy, real heavy.

0312263120|3.0|...that this is one of his early novels.  The character development and plot twists are nowhere near as intricate as in Angels &amp; Demons and The Da Vinci Code (the first two books of his I read -- and adore).  I kept waiting for the big climax of the story, but it never happened.  Maybe that's because I was able to figure out who the villian was by page 100.  Still, not a bad way to pass a rainy afternoon.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|donnie darko is by far my favorite movie. i adore it. it is thought-provoking, intense, beautifully filmed and written, and the song &quot;mad world&quot; will be stuck in your head for days. i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a truly original and gorgeous film experience.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This CD is awesome! I liked almost all the songs on it. I am rather surprised there wasn't more of the songs released on the radio from this album. This group is one of the best in my opinion!
B00003CWTH|4.0|its a two tape long movie but its great and its actors do good. the end with all the frogs was unexpected fot me and it was hilarious to see that, its rainging frogs damnit!!! Tom Cruise delivers the powerfullest performance in here as the son of a dying father and he confronts his father in tape two. the relationship bewteen Melora Walters and John C. Reilly is oddly likable. pt andersons other films Punch-Drunk Love and Boogie Nights I recommend too
0783240503|4.0|For a musical, this movie wasn't bad.  I didn't really like the whole musical thing but the songs were catchy and and none of them were alike.  The play had a great variety of music like Hip-hop, Country western, Elvis style, and many more.  The plot of this movie was predictable but good.  I liked the idea of the school set, and the teachers being the actors.   In conclusion I belive that this movie is good.
B000002UR7|4.0|Before Radiohead managed to achieve their full potential as the extraordinary band that they are today, their debut &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; introduced the band to the whole world.  &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; became a smash thanks to the radio smash &quot;Creep&quot; (a song that had since become a rock radio staple) that the band today claims nearly ruined them.  &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;, and &quot;Lurgee&quot; are all hypnotic and emotional tracks that display Radiohead before they hit their stride.  Vocalist Thom Yorke manages to offer a sense of hope in his lyrics behind all the gloom of the band's music, and while &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; is a more than solid debut album, it would only be a taste of things to come with subsequent releases like &quot;The Bends&quot; and the masterpiece that is &quot;OK Computer&quot;.
B000006OAM|5.0|I have to say that Ophelia is one of the most original albums I've heard in a long while. It seems like the airwaves have been innundated with so much similar sounding stuff (&quot;staind or nickelback&quot;?, &quot;green day or alien ant farm&quot;?). while I enjoy the music from these similar sounding artists, when you hear Natalie's stuff, you can be sure it's Natalie Merchant and no other.<br />The songs just seem to connect and flow so fluidly and subtlely with all the smooth drum backbeats and Graham Maby's exquisite bass lines. A true chill out album. <br />Put this album on while you're driving on a long stretch of empty road (preferably with little or no other cars, preferably at night) and you tell me how you feel. A most pleasant way to wind down your day.<br />Keep it up Natalie!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|After reading some of the reviews here, I'm getting a clearer idea of what people are expecting from movies.  The hightlights, or at least the most talked about parts of the first movie were obviously the action scenes.  So when the second movie hits, are people really expecting two hours of fight scenes?  All of the scenes have a purpose, if you're paying attention.  I've noticed a tendancy in movie-goers to want it all layed out for them; &quot;We got no time for sub-plots, back-story or morals!  Kick some ass!  Special effects, man!&quot;  And then when they pull out all the stops for scenes like the many, many smiths, people complain about not knowing why it's happening!  Look a little deeper.  <BR>Everything that Neo goes through, has happened before, except the Smith thing.  It's a new thing, and the key to stopping the endless sequence.  <BR>I found the story fascinating, especially the ending.  Sure, Neo is a superhuman in the Matrix, but what made it possible for him to stop the sentinel in the 'real' world?  How did Smith infect someone in the 'real' world?  All this suggests to me that they never left the matrix at all.  Quite a puzzle, and I'm excited for Revolutions to hit theaters.<BR>Now, in the interests of fairness, I admit that the rave sequence was gratuitous, but that was the only thing I had a problem with.  And even that had a purpose if you look at it as a whole.<BR>I'm just sayin, you know?  Look at the whole, and you get a fun movie.
B00000JZIK|5.0|great mystery thriller and a lot of action. pure genius from start to a brillantly done finish. the cast are great, especially Spacey.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I liked this movie a lot.  The action was great, it had a good bit of humor, the characters were lively and the story moved along at a good pace. The sets were beautiful.  A lot of things about the Matrix were explained.  The twins were cool, Neo was kicking butt all over the place.  I wish there was a bit more Jada -- I wasn't a big Jada fan, but she was delightful in this movie.  There are very few movies that I buy -- this is one of those few.
0316666343|1.0|i read this book because it was recommended by a friend. What a disappointment! The beginning was very gripping and well written but it went downhill from there. My criticisms:<br />1 - It's a great premiss. A book written from heaven is unusual, and the author quickly establishes the fact thatit could work - I  was sceptical at first. But once you establish such a premiss you have to be consistent. Life after death is a serious theological theme. You can't go on to treat heaven as a playground. How come there is no confrontation, meeting, etc with God? Even if you don't believe in God the premiss is heaven so you MUST confront the issues of life after death, redemption, spiritual growth, God's love  etc. Otherwise the house of cards you have built collapses. It's like setting a book in Buckingham Palace but carefully avoiding all mention of the Queen.<BR>2. The death of the murderer is deeply flawed and unsatisfying. To the people on earth it's simply an accident. It happens much too late to have any connection with the crime. In other words, the murderer has escaped scott free. A good storyteller would have somehow arranged for Suzie to show people on earth who the murderer was.<BR>3. The mourning family never go anywhere. They just go round and round in circles. Stirring in the same old soup forever.<BR>4. The Indian characters were totally unrealistic. No Indians behave this way. Saris are not worn with trousers. The name was quite wrong.
0385335482|4.0|I picked this book up on one of my random magazine splurges simply because of the title. <br />It is a light read which is effective in counter acting the sometimes daunting university textbooks. Although Becky's shopping habit is entertaining I found the true merits of this book to be found elsewhere. After you fire through this book you will become deeply involved with the heroine and you will end up buying the next two simply because you want to find out what happens to her. <br />It is a series of book based on the life of a trendy Londoner who eventually moves to New York. What is not to like? You are given insight into her personal problems and it becomes very gripping. I'm obsessed with New York City and I read one of the books while I was on vacation in London. It was great fun to visit some of the places which were talked about in the book. <br />I recommended it to a friend and she was not impressed after starting the first novel however she became involved and has now finished all three and become a fan of the series. <br />A new heroine by the same author has been planned for 2004.
B00009RDG9|4.0|This movie has the most realistic knife fights ever filmed...Well, kinda. Since I actually train in knife fighting, I can tell you this, Toomy Lee Jones &amp; Benico Del Toro characters must have really liked one another very much. A real knife fight, as the ones that have taken place in the phillipines for decades, are quick and brutal. If you think a real knife fights last longer than a few seconds, you'd be mistaken. But, with the premise of this film, these characters are very skilled at Kali/escrima/Silat, the characters could possibly pull off all the blocks that keep these knife fights going; maybe... Both Jones &amp; Del Toro were trained by the team of Tom Kier and Rafael Kayanan, two of the most noted instructors of Sayoc Kali in the world. I think their movements were very realistic and believeable.<br />With all that said, I did enjoy the movie. I would'nt call this a masterpiece, but I would'nt call it garbage either. It produces the type of film you see in the previews. The Tommy Lee Jones character is based on a real person, Tom Brown Jr., who is a remarkable man with some amazing talents; he known as the best Wilderness survival and Tracking expert in world. And, in that I also found this movie very interresting. If you into knife fighting, this is a must have movie for you.
B00006BS6T|4.0|a cool action movie with great set pieces that blow you away literally. the part where the building explodes and Wilson's hearing goes off is really a neat thing. theres a lot of dizzy camera work but it pays off in the end, tough the final battle with Wilson and the sniper doesnt add up entirely.
B00006RU5B|1.0|When Chris Cornell was approached by the members of RATM, he said that he absolutely refused to write political lyrics. WTF!<br />I can't believe that Tom Morello being the intelligent graduate of political science from Harvard would join such a band.<br />Tom is tremendously involved in politics and is one of the strongest voices on the left along with System of a Down and countless punk bands. So isn't it awful that he can't voice himself or even be himself in this supergroup?<br />Obviously this is something that the former RATM members thought would be fun, but the real reason that Audioslave exists is money. All members had nothing better to do than form a radio-friendly supergroup and sell out big time.<br />I still like Tom Morello, but selling out is when you put money before your values and that is exactly what he has done.<br />So free these slaves by not buying their audio.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Most people that have reviewed this film so far make valid comments on what there is &quot;not to like&quot; about this latest installment of the Matrix trilogy.  Going into this film I was expecting a whole lot and the film delivered...mostly.  This is a more action oriented film that may confuse people for a little while (questions will be answered soon, so hold on 'till November).  While the fight sequences take center stage and impressive set pieces dominate the landscape.  I agree that somethings are silly and stupid (already mentioned by others) but there is a lot to like.  &quot;Reloaded&quot; had some big shoes to fill since part 1 had a crazy huge and unexpected plot turn in the first half.  So far the Wachowski's have made an intriguing two films with the third looking to tidy up all the loose ends.  While the 'neo superman' thing is annoying it isn't toally unexpected-that's how part one ended.
B00006BTCA|5.0|With their first main offering Interpol give the listener a collection of songs that are truly amazing. I work at a department store in the music &amp; movies dept. and we always show videos from artists promoting their cd's. Obstacle 1 would come on and after a while it got burned into my head. I bought &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; expecting more of the same but instead got a much more complex yet equally delightful sound. Each song is outstanding and has many levels with excellent bass, drumming, guitar, and vocals. Some key tracks are &quot;Hands Away&quot;, &quot;Lief Erikson&quot; and the &quot;Untitled&quot; track. After recomending this cd to many friends and listening to it so much I had to buy another cd because the first was wearing out, I can truly call this one of my favorite albums. I recently saw them live and they are as tight and honestly even better live.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Glad to see so many of the reviews here are 5 stars.  Take a song like &quot;Dinner at Eight;&quot;  only a handful of contemporary artists can write such strangely beautiful lyrics.
B00005ATQC|4.0|this is Stanley Kubricks( director of The Shining and Full Metal Jacket) last motion picture as a great hollywood director. the leads are powerful and you always gotta have Sydney Pollack fighting with someone and getting angry. lots of nuidty is plentiful in this movie but besides this its a great paranoia and mystery film. works good if your stoned
B00006SFBD|5.0|I'm new to Opeth and bought this album after hearing Master's Apprentices on KNAC.com. Dude! This album is almost too good to listen too! It totally blows my mind how much sheer talent is in this band. They're... well perfect! Of course they're not my favorite band, but for what they set out to do they achieve sheer perfection. I've never heard such skill, creativity, and song writing ability combined like this. <br />How often have you heard bands try to combine different styles of music and fail? Opeth effortlessly create seamless transitions between mellow acoustic singing and thundering death metal vocals. I highly recommend it to anyone that is into metal and is curious about Opeth. I know from experience that it's a wonderful introduction.<br />You know I always wondered what would happen if there was too much talent in a band... now I know.<br />Also, I must tell you if you don't know anything about Opeth, their songs are like 15 minutes long each. So, their albums may look small, but they're quite big and the songs seem to go on forever (in a good way). Opeth takes you places in their songs.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I guess I have to say I am so impressed with the remainder of what use to be At The Drive In.  Granted, this is a departure from ATDI, but the nonsensical lyrics and the falsetto voice is still there, which I love.  It's spacey, full of motion, and makes me convulse in my chair.  So that's a good thing.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|If you think &quot;The Matrix&quot; has ruined action movies as we know it.  I for one am raising my hand about 500 million feet in the air.  &quot;Bullet Time&quot; has ruined every action movie because they're all trying to be &quot;The Matrix&quot; and that includes &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded.&quot;  Let's take BT (Bullet Time) and slow it down even more.  Let's run about one frame per year.  Right from the start I was disgusted by the BT.  What were they thinking?  <br />I'm getting to the dialogue folks.  The action was way way too crazy.  There is a certain line that shouldn't be crossed and they broke it right in half.  The fight with the Agent Smiths was very stupid.  I was hoping it would end about 5 minutes into it, but it didn't end for like another 10 minutes.  The scenes with &quot;The Oracle&quot; really bother me because they're just not that interesting.  <br />The only good addition to the film is Neo's ability to fly.  That is very cool.  &quot;The Twins&quot; were very annoying to me and the whole chase scene with them was a big Cadillac commercial.  The scene in the French restaurant annoyed the hell out of me.  <br />Then there is the famous &quot;Zion Party&quot; scene.  Oh my.  That brought out a lot of laughter.  I haven't laughed that much since &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; and I only laughed at that because it's the worst movie ever!!!!!!  All involved should have been punished.<br />The party/dance scene was totally stupid and pointless.  Now I know you're going to say to yourself, &quot;They were just illustrating the unbreakable spirit of the people of Zion,&quot; but come on folks, we can do better than that.  Let's not forget Morpheus' speech before the wanking begins.  What an unforgetable speech in the history of movies.  Not since &quot;Independence Day&quot; has there been such a stupid speech in a movie.....oh oh oh, I take that back.  Not since Samuel L. Jackson's when the going get tough speech in &quot;Deep Blue Sea.&quot;  That was comedic genius.  Thank you Samuel L.<br />Is it me, or were there only two white people in Zion?  Neo and Trinity were the only two.  How's that possible?  This is not a racist comment, it's just an observation.  Did anyone else notice that?  <br />Anywho.  They spent too much time on action.  No time on script.  And squandered what could have been a good cinema experience.  Richard Roeper praised this as some giant leap forward in action movies, but I think he just got caught up in the hype.  This is one of the worst movies of the year.  <br />If you want to see a great movie this year, buy &quot;A Mighty Wind.&quot;  The comedy is amazing and so is the acting.  They draw out a lot of emotions from the audience (especially Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara).  Let's not forget that the majority of that movie is improved.  <br />Don't buy The Matrix: Reloaded.  Don't rent it.  You'll feel bad afterwards....I did.  It's awful to the infinity billionth degree.<br />Heed my warning.<br />Sincerely,<br />John Doe
B00001ODHF|5.0|way awesome Bruce Campbell movie, though it doesnt surpass Evil Dead 2. this one is set in the medevil times with funny ass skeletons. possibly the funniest scene is with Campbell in the cemetary resiting the words and then he is attacked by the skeleton hands. pure genius
B00005JLWN|5.0|It's shameful to think that this movie was in theaters for only a couple of weeks in 2002.  The little fan fair it received (mostly due to the low budget) was not deserved.  Anyone would have been lucky to have seen this 'film' in theaters. <br />Yes.  This was a FILM...not just another movie.<br />It was emotional.  I wanted to cry with his character when he heard classical music for the first time.  I felt for his character as he felt an absolute need to protect that puppy after witnessing the previous events(don't want to give anything away).  If I had his abilities, I would have fought for that dog myself.(You have to look at everything leading up to that scene.)  This film also showed how you CAN have a superb fight scene performed without all the wires and CGI.  There were things in the fight scenes of 'The Matrix Reloaded' that made me laugh.  There was nothing about the fight scenes in 'Equilibrium' that made me laugh.  And about the GunKata: I believe it was a very unique idea.  A lot of movie makers don't have the guts to be that creative.  I give the idea itself a B+.<br />Where 'The Matrix Reloaded' tries to be a movie, 'Equilibrium' succeeds in becoming a film.  This is an absolute must see.
B000068PNQ|3.0|hey there.  i'll come at this one from a different direction, and that is as part of the deluxe series ... i have many, if not all of the 'deluxe' sets and i found this one, in particular to be a disappointment.    yeah, they kept andy's banana sticker (and made it better by making it vinyl instead of paper) and the package itself is up to standard, but as many people have pointed out here already, the mono and stereo differences are really for purists only ... for the casual listener, or even a fairly hardcore musicologist, the stereo/mono differences just seem like overkill ... if you're used to the differences between the stereo and mono in the beach boys or the beatles, you'll be very disappointed with what's been done here.    comparing this to, say, the wailers 'catch a fire' deluxe set, there's simply no comparison.  the original jamaican versions vs. the north american releases are stark and striking.  here it's mostly just subtle and, to my ear, boring.  you're definitely, definitely not getting your money's worth by paying for the extra disc.  if you need to get everything by the band, well, you've already bought it anyway ... but if you lie merely in the 'strongly interested in the band' region, save yourself a few bucks and get the single disc version of the album.    thanks for reading.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Lots of Good songs here...  I love the School of Rock songs, can't get them out of my head..<br />That song that is in the movie but not on the album is Roadrunner by The Modern Lovers.  This is Jonathan Richman's band from the early to mid 70s.  Before he was in There's Something About Mary, you know...  This band also included Jerry Harrison, who would later join the Talking Heads, and David Robinson, who was to be The Cars' drummer.  Their album should be available here on Amazon as it was reissued by Rhino not to long ago.<br />Also, is it just me, or did they change the name of The Ramones song that appears on this album?  This is my favorite Ramones song and I always thought it was called Bonzo Goes to Bitburg....<br />Oh well, still.  Get the album,see the movie.<br />Winthrop Fist
B00006LPK5|3.0|the beginning is ok but the rest with the dragons high in the sky and the action puts this one to place. this one is hot, hot , hot and can McConaghuey be any balder or buffer. Bale is great as always. better dragon movie then Dungeons and Dragons
B00005OAIE|4.0|I've perused the reviews for John Mayer's &quot;Room for Squares&quot; for quite some time now, and always found a clear dichotomy of opinion. I'll admit, the first twenty, thirty times I heard Mayer, I hated his music with a fervor becoming of the pretentious music elitist that I am. It was bland, uninspired- indeed, crafted for the top 40. Several of my better music rants were inspired by the first few chords of &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. How could someone so dispassionate make it big? Then, one day, I was sitting on my couch eating a bit of a Tombstone pizza and flipping through music channels. I don't watch much TV, but if I do, I'll check the video channels to see what the current Big Thing is. I stumbled upon some college-aged, sweatered guy with an acoustic guitar, asking of his audience, &quot;am I living it right?&quot;<BR>Hah. Too cute. This guy's pseudofolk has got nothing on MY vastly superior pseudofolk. <BR>This is a bit catchy, though.<BR>Before I knew it, I'd pilfered the record from one of my less hip comrades. I still didn't care much for &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, it still seemed bland and Adult Mainstream, but &quot;Why Georgia&quot; showed some serious promise. I could rock this with my sunroof down, sure. &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; performed similarly- nothing too heavy, nothing too intellectual, and nothing too original- but he does what he does pretty damn well. The music had a simple honesty, as if old JM knew that he wasn't groundbreaking or revolutionary but he played anyway. It seemed completely free of pretension, just an honest record from the bottom of his everyman heart. &quot;Neon&quot; is way-catchy diet jazz, &quot;3x5&quot; is vaguely exotic and impossibly hooky, and &quot;Back to You&quot; is at once airy and engaging. <BR>I'm still a bit hesitant to admit it, but I thoroughly enjoy &quot;Room For Squares&quot;. A few tracks are lacking in quality, yes, and the candied-sex metaphors of &quot;Your Body...&quot; still get cringesout of me. But that's no reason not to enjoy the poppy (albeit lightweight) fun of &quot;Room For Squares&quot;. I recommend it completely- any indie credibility I possess among my friends can afford the small hit that accompanies enjoying John Mayer.
B00004TJWE|5.0|Snapper Music released the mono version of this album quite a while before issuing the stereo mix.  that could almost be called dirty business practice, for once you've heard the whole new psychedelic dimension this version offers, you won't want to go back to the mono: There's that much more to hear and revel in.  It's difficult to hear this without thinking of Pink Floyd's Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, not surprising given producer Norman Smith's work on both.  This really is one of the best cds I've purchased in a long time, and I highly encourage those of you who've either already bought the mono version, or are considering buying it because of its lower list price, to go the extramile and buy this one: You won't be sorry.  Note: All four bonus tracks are in mono: Apparently no stereo mixes of those tracks can be found--or created.  Really, the only advantage the all-mono edition has over this one is that it contains the full-length 4:30 version of &quot;Defecting Grey,&quot; whereas this edition contains the original single.  That's a small price to pay, however, in exchange for the fun you'll have putting on your stereo headphones and listening to one of the all-time innovative psychedelic masterworks the way it really deserves to be heard.  Buy it!
B000069AUI|5.0|COLDPLAY is the best band in the world, a simple fact. Since their utterly essential debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot; was released they have not looked back; but when it came to a second album, it would be quite a task to live up to the first. They have achieved this task though in wonderful form. This time it's much more happier and upbeat than the last album, with beautiful tracks like &quot;In my place&quot; and the unbeatable &quot;Clocks&quot;. Each track has a different mood to it, and not a single song feels out of place.&quot;Warning sign&quot; is easily the most under rated song on the album. With deep lyrics and a beautiful melody, it's one of the things that makes &quot;A rush of blood to the head&quot; so brilliant. You must buy this as this is one of the best albums of all time.
B000096IB6|3.0|this was better than Spider-man last year. Ben Affleck is really grat as Daredevil and Jennifer Garner is sexy in leather ad Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan is huge as Kingpin and of course theres Mr. Colin Farrell whos brilliant as Bullseye, he steals the whole movie. there are cameos in here by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith too and David Keith adds spark as the little devils dad who gets killed in the beginning. great action scenes but some are corny as hell, like that fight between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner when its daylight out and by the kids playground.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|Even though this movie is not as good as the first, a car lover is going to like the movie regardless.  Granted, the plot was kinda weak, but you can't go wrong with the even better souped up cars, and an incredibly intense racing scene to start the movie out.  The racing scene was kinda unrealistic, but come on, it's a movie.  Thats's the whole point.  What disappointed me was the 2 cars that were chosen to be the main cars.  They sucked.  Why didn't they use the Nissan Skyline?  That car could have been the nicest and one of the fasted cars I have ever seen.  That car was tight.  They didn't show it enough.  I think the lack of Vin was missed.  I think he really helped make the first movie a good one.  But overall I think this is a must see.  Movies don't have to be realistic.  Life is boring.  That's why we have movies.  For those of you who diss this movie because of its lack of realism or sad plot....shut up.  No one is asking you to watch it again.  At times it is intense and the racing scenes are better with more skilled driving.  Just watch it.  But you don't have to take my word for it.
0425166805|3.0|A UFO obsessed friend of mine recommended this title to me, and now having read it all the way through (twice!) I'm not really sure what all the fuss is actually about. Sure it is interesting, and yes it is a lot of fun to read this theory, however it appears that Von Daniken has thrown the idea of &quot;proper research&quot; out the window, and instead relied upon so the so many speculations, and falsities which seem to make up this fringe group of UFO obsessives.<br />Do I believe in extraterrestrial life? Absolutely. Do I believe they have made contact with the human race throughout history? Possibly. Do I believe that anything in this book is true? No.<br />What Von Daniken is trying to do with 'Chariots of the Gods?' is to make the claim that humanity, within all it's diversity, and intelligence is little more than a product of alien intelligence (what's that say for us?); that all of the great civilizations which have existed through time (the Maya, the Egyptian, the Sumerian, etc.) were all involved in some kind of &quot;alien worship&quot;; and that all of the beautiful relics of the past (the statues at Easter Island, the lid of Paleque, the Pyramids, etc.) were little more than &quot;landing instruments&quot; for these extraterrestrial &quot;gods&quot;.<br />Not to be taken seriously, but would make an excellent storyline to an number of sci-fi films out there today.
B00005JMCT|3.0|American Pie 1 was amazing<BR>American Pie 2 was a really good follow up<BR>American Wedding WOULD have been a good movie if it wasnt a follow up. It had too much to live up to so it could NEVER reach the heights of especially the first American Pie. BUT it still have its funny moments. It's worth a rent at least but beware that it aint as good as the first two American Pie movies.
B00005JKEC|4.0|training day snaps at you and it does that by Denzels gritty and pulsating performance. Ethan Hawke is also great as Hoyt, who is put on the spot and sees the real Denzel. began great and ending riveting, this'll put some adrenaline into your viens.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I actually see some people didn't give this movie 5 stars.  I'm heading to my shrink today to try and understand why.<br />As I said in my title, Pacino is GOD!<br />Al plays a Cuban immigrant with an eye for money and power.  He slowly works his way up in the cocaine biz, going through anyone and anything that gets in his way.<br />Pacino's character is one who is beset with many emotional problems.  He has an obsession with his sister that is kind of creepy.  However, the character does have some morals.  He will not kill women or children, and there is something about this coked out drug dealer you just have to love.  I don't think any other actor could have pulled off this kind of performance.<br />One of the top ten movies I've seen to date.<br />I'll say it one last time.  Al Pacino is God!!!!!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I don't have the CD's but I saw the movie and I loved it. The only reason why I'm bothering to write a review is to tell that other reviewer, and anyone else who was wondering, that the song the girl with the eyepatch is whistling is the theme from the movie Twisted Nerve. <br />Since that theme belongs to another movie, it would make sense as to why it would not be included on the soundtrack.
B0000029LG|5.0|Quincy Jones was the perfect producer for Michael Jackson.  He took all that was sloppy and unformed about Michael and put it into a neat glossy package, reigned in his excesses to make pop materpieces like \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Bad,\\" and \\"Off the Wall.\\"  This is why Disc 1 shines.  With Q at the helm, Michael's soprano sounds breathy and nimble, and his songwriting sits nicely next to well-crafted fare by Rod Temperton, Paul McCartney, or Siedah Garrett.  <br />Now, Michael is alone and embattled.  On Disc 2, Michael's soprano sounds thin and uncertain at times.  Q's buoyant horn sections and pop gloss are a thing of the past.  The songs have a new jack emptiness and sometimes sound like slamming doors.  There is a compensation, though:  Michael Jackson is allowed to be human here.<br />Every song on Disc 2 refers directly or indirectly to the...scandal that erupted in MJ's life in 1993.  It's what really made Michael want to scream, and it's behind the paranoia of \\"They Don't Really Care about Us.\\"  \\"Money\\" and \\"This Time Around\\" and \\"2 Bad\\" are direct attacks on Michael's 13-year-old accuser and the boy's avaricious father.  \\"A Stranger in Moscow,\\" ostensibly about looking over one's shoulder for the KGB, undoubtably refers to the way the authorities who investigated Michael made him feel.  His voice sounds creamy and lush as he sings of the \\"swift and sudden fall from grace\\" which is surely his own.<br />\\"Then a beggar boy called my name/ Happy days still drown the pain.\\"  The male [abuser] and the needy boy are indeed often a happy match, and Michael is saying he still has moments of joy despite being trampled by one of society's most potent taboos.  This is the only Michael Jackson album where he offers us any glimpse into his emotional life.  What we see is largely sloppy and angry but it is, at long last, honest.<br />The man with bandages on his fingers and a surgeon's mask over his face bidding on the Elephant Man's bones and penning songs for disfigured AIDS patients has expressed his victimhood in his music for the first time.  Even the haunting \\"Earth Song,\\" ostensibly about the scars of pollution, seems to be coming from a hurt place within Michael.  Even as its lush Oooing and Ahhing chorus takes us back to childhood, its gospel crescendo whisks us heavenward on a flaming chariot.  \\"Earth Song\\" is a gorgeous masterpiece.<br />The abused child makes a chilling appearance in \\"Little Susie,\\" a plaintive Broadway-style song whose refrain is paraphrased Edgar Allen Poe.  Michael tries sappy sentimentality in \\"Childhood\\" and \\"Smile,\\" two of the album's weaker offerings, but luckily they're counterbalanced by tunes like MJ's sharp satire \\"Tabloid Junkie.\\"<br />Most of the album, though, is the anti-Thriller, raw with anger and sorrow.  Like it or not, Michael has opened up his haunted heart.
B00005JKBB|5.0|begins well and ends satisfying. I liked the basics of this movie. Redford brings Pitt into his world and trains him and then Pitt meets a women and falls in love with her and the woman is played great by the lovely Catherine McCormack(The Tailor Of Panama, Shadow Of The Vampire). lots of helicopter shots as well.

0553374842|5.0|Awesome Illustrations and enjoyable narratives to go along with them. Lots of fun.
B000066C8G|4.0|really funny comedy about a male model who after he lost an award show award to Hansel(Owen Wilson) and after seeing his friends die in a freak gasoline fire accident, goes home to try to find his roots but then comes back and gets brainwashed so he can kill the prime minister of Malaysia by Mugatu(Will Ferrell with a puppy). Zoolander(Ben Stiller) is helped by the lovely Christine Taylor(who is real life is his real wife) and Hansel to try to stop Mugatu and his plan and help kids how to read good. funny dialouge and hilarious performances make this wild. Jon Voight as Zoolanders dad is awesome and theres a lot of celeb cameos as well.
B00000295A|5.0|Return of the Space Cowboy was the first Jamiroquai cd I bought, but Emergency on Planet Earth is the one I will remember forever.  Much better and different than anything they did later on, this album plays to your soul and your mind.  It is always within grabbing distance to get my mind right when I mistakenly let the world get to me.Funk, soul, and progressive politics and the unforgettable &quot;Blow your mind&quot; which has set the mood at my apt. many a night.  Buy and enjoy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Worlds beyond the usual concert film, this is a deeply emotional experience for those lucky enough to have had George's music woven into their lives. A perfect balance of joy, laughter and loss, a delicate and perfect balance of rock, pop, blues, comedy, classical Eastern raga and ukelele. Contrary to most tribute and hall of fame concerts finding dozens of dinosaurs falling all over each other in sloppy camaraderie and faulty beats, this assembly under Eric Clapton's direction give specific, tight, heartfelt and soaring performances of exceptional grandeur... so obviously trying to do their best for George that it tears your heart out at points. Clapton's work is both grief stricken and exhilarating, McCartney's sadness renders him unusually subdued and appealing, Anoushka Shankar's performance is absolutely transcendant, and Sam Brown's rockin' rendition of \\"Horse to Water\\" is a killer, a real treat. This film is, to put it simply, an exquisite and overwhelming experience. Thank you George. And George, just so you'll know... there wasn't a dry eye in the theater...
0783240503|3.0|I liked the part at the end where Jacob came to Egypt to see his son Joseph. The costums were also very good. The songs were pretty cool too.
B000089CJI|5.0|I was introduced to the Postal Service by my best friend who goes to college at Michigan State, where supposidly they are pretty popular. With the single &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, a frequent bar-goer from the DC could't help but love. It was once I got past the infatuation of that single that I realized the depth of the album. The electronic-techno beats reminded me a little of Hooverphonic in the &quot;Magnificent Tree&quot;, but with a little more of a dance beat. That sense of whimsy is still there tho. It is that sense of whimsy, combined with the dreaminess of the album that makes it my favorite and only album to listen to driving home late at night. It keeps you going while lulling you... the contradiction making the Postal Service all that much more attractive.
B000002J1I|3.0|This CD has a lot of variety on it but I do enjoy listening to most of the songs . I just don't think it's a great CD as a whole . I've heard better by the band but I'm glad it's part of my collection .
B00005JM0B|4.0|Ok so this isn't as good as t1 or t2, but so what this movie is very exciting from end to finish and I can't wait to view it in dvd...I hope t4 will be made because this movie leaves open ground for another sequel. Although I don't think it will be the same without Arnold.
B00000F6LQ|4.0|Only recently I´ve watched this 1975 movie (to be exact, on October 10th, 2003). Man, I could not believe how good, clever, extremely enjoyable comedy this movie was. By Monty Phyton, I had only watched before The Life of Brian.<br />Almost every gag and joke works perfectly here. The best parts, in my opinion, are too many to mention: the killer rabbit; the fight between Arthur and the Black Night; Lancelot storming a wedding party and killing everyone; the drawing artist who suffers a heart attack and so the dragon stops pursuing the heroes; the Bridge of Death, with its guardian and three &quot;very difficult&quot; questions;.... I could go on and on. Man, this is humour at its best.
0783240503|2.0|I liked how they had so many different types of music that they sang.  And I liked how they had all of the kids singing too.  Another thing that I liked was that the teachers were the acters.
0066214122|5.0|Before I read this novel by Mr Michael Crichton I had never heard of the word nanotechnology and much less nanorobots. It is a very exciting book and yes this is not very different from the other Crichton books like Jurassic Park or Timeline and the Andromeda Strain, it still a book about science gone wrong, but so what, as long as it's exciting and not boring he should keep writing books like this. Michael Crichton cand do no wrong, I have read all of his books and all of them are great.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Danc of Death is a very good album. No masterpiece, but very good, and with at least three songs that will make the fan really satisfied: Montsegur, PASCHENDALE and DANCE OF DEATH. <br />I just would like to make a comment about a reviewer called &quot;tunsoffun&quot;, that said that Janick Gers can play, live, &quot;the solos note by note&quot;. Has he ever watched a video or DVD by Iron Maiden?! Has he ever watched Iron Maiden live?? Janick not only does NOT play his solos note by note, but also destroys all the past solos created by Adrian Smith in the classic albums. He jumps all around exactly because he does not care about playing them note by note!(and apparently the Boss, Steve Harris, thinks that this is cool). I´m not saying this is a good or a bad thing, I´m just stating what is clear for eveyone to see (and hear!).<br />Dance of Death is a very good album, I just wish the guitars were more heavy and clear. Yes, they are muddy, that´s the correct word. In the Martin Birch produced albums, theyre were not muddy. And that was not due to &quot;studio magic&quot;, it was simply a question of a master handling the production.

B0000B1OFN|2.0|Norton made this film due to pressure from the studio to an existing contract. IT was his worst performance ever.<br />Walhberg is almost sleeping (as always).<br />The plot is a joke. Alright, the Mini-Coopers were a great advertising scheme, myself want to buy one right now...<br />Seth Green was the only actor to save himself in this turkey.<br />The bad guys (in this case, the good guys, because they steal a lot of things and get away with it!)use always the same plot: blow anything that is above our heads and the money / gold / whatever / will fall right at our side. Very clever.<br />If stupidity has a name, it´s the remake of The Italian Job.
1878424319|1.0|What I find most atrocious about this despicable little attempt at a self-help book is its hipocracy. If the author thought that he was giving true insight for the best of other people, that would be one thing, and he would give the book away for free. Instead, the book costs thirteen dollars, two dollars of each copy probably goes to the author. I don't think that he is in it for the good of others or to &quot;share the truth&quot;. I think that he wants to milk this little cow for all it is worth. All he needs now is a celebrity sponsor to &quot;change their life&quot; and he would have a fortune on his hands. <br />If you want more proof, look at the seminars, companion books, workbooks, etc that he allows to be put out. This isn't about what is right; it's about what is profitable. Even that wouldn't be so obnoxious if people weren't willing to swallow it. Instead, people say that this book changes their lives. It doesn't. Only you can change your life. No book will do it for you. This book is annoying, obnoxious, and hypocritical. <br />If I had the chance, I would go back in time and refuse to read it. I am terribly happy that I borrowed it from a friend instead of buying it myself, because I would have to throw it in the trash. I wouldn't rent it, I DEFINITELY wouldn't buy it, and I wouldn't even read it. Pass.<BR>Harkius
B00006879E|5.0|As many have noted before me, Maroon 5 is a group worth lisening too. The lyrics coupled with the stylized beats, at least for me a pop junkie, provide another side of the face of pop.  I could talk about the Adam Levine's awesome vocals, but you can just read another review.  And i could analyze the funky, hyper-charged beats, but if you listen to the samples on the site you can hear them for yourself.<br />i want to talk about how this alum is, for me, what i hoped pop music would evolve into.  you have the fun, buble-gum of the late 90's, that was good for it's time.  however, it went nowhere, but off a cliff. the musical genius of the album stems from more than the lyrics, but the affect that said lyrics have on their audience.  one may say after listening to the songs they play out like a boy band ballad,  preferably the Backstreet Boys, if you want to get technical. i am no way insulting the group, i am stating that their lyrics are an evolved state of that era in music, which doesn't treat it's audience like hormonally charged teens, rather takes us to the next level, giving the now young adults that grew up w/ BSB a mature look at love and what happens in love.<br />maybe i am looking too deep into the songs, but upon first listen i honestly felt like that--deeply affected by the lyrics. if you listen to this album, at least as a young adult (18-25) and do not get where i'm coming from...then i don't know what you are listening to.<br />i highly recommend this album to those who lost their faith in the love song, in the boy bands...because this does more than fill that void, it engulfs it and leaves no room for loneliness. i honestly mean that!!!
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Yes, this new sound on Enigma does take some getting use to, but it is still great. On my first listen to the CD I was surprised at how new it was, and how it integrated some of the old sound as well.  My only complaint is that it is only 47 minutes long.  Come on, only 47 minutes?
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Despite all the negative reviews I think the movie was quite amazing. It may not be as story driven as the first one but the action sequences are a lot more eloaborate then it's predecessor. Viewing the movie multiple times helped me understand what this chapter was all about and the conclusion as we all know by now will be resolved in the revolutions. Still I think the movie was teriffic and I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B00005A3KS|5.0|first of all, this title has a DTS audio format. It maybe attracts you. Because the story is about surfer and surfing.<BR>the sound is very important, i think.<BR>anyway, if you have seen this movie before and like it, you should have this title. the sound and clear screen will make you happy and satisfy.<BR> and you'll see what the &quot;100% adrenalin&quot; is.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|After listening to Want One..you can't wait and stab at Want Two. This Album is the best yet of Rufus Wainright. It's a total package. Lyrically makes sense in every tract and musically diverse as the next tract. Put simply it makes you think and pleasing tones but certainly not ear candy.
B000062YAZ|2.0|Ummm... if you want good speed/thrash metal, buy some early Metallica and Megadeth albums... or Slayer - South Of Heaven
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the GREATEST ALBUM in the world! Of all the Tool albums this is by far the best! Of all the albums in the world, this is BY FAR THE BEST! After listening to this album it makes me want to pawn all my previous albums, because I have realized that I have wasted my money. Besides the amazing nine songs, there are some weird and dragging little skits of the unknown to scare the crap out of you. But with a little drink on and a little smoke on you will love to unknown scary music too. This album never gets old. There are times when you feel like you can't listen to the same ...9 songs anymore and want to listen to something else and then you will realize that Tool have set such a high standard for music that you can't find any subtitudes. It will only take me a few days of rest and the album will be blasting once again. The bands these days suck major ass, can't sing, can't play, can't write and is all image.  <BR>For the ones who don't like this album. Why don't you like this album? you wanted get your[self] kicked? Give a few tries to understand what the music is doing and where does it lead to and what purpose. Understand the lyrics and feel the music and just observe the world around you.<BR>Tool is the only band where every band members stands out and kicks major... The band work well with each other and no one is taking too much of the spotlight. Also, they build each other to created the amazing mood setting. The lyrical contain is true, beautiful, intelligent, and sedductive. Although, some of Maynard's lyrical content can get pretty offensive to alot of the christian believers, but at least he is truth to himself and not afraid to say what he beliefs in. Unlike some of \\"you\\" just belief what others belief and in fear of punishment...
0783240503|3.0|This is an OK movie.  The movie was pretty funny at times.  I thought the sets were very cool.  I don't really like the all the singing in the movie.  It would have been better if this movie only had a few scenes with songs.  The songs were catchy, and I don't really like that.  They had a ton of music types in the movie, like country, rap, Elvis, etc.  The acting was also good.  I would really only recommend this movie to someone that likes singing or musicals.
0783240503|4.0|Joseph and the Amzaing Technicolor Dreamcoat is an interesting movie. I enjoyed watching the creativeness in the costums. I thought it was a good movie to learn more about eygpt in a fun way.  It was fun listening to the singing and the diffrent songs. It was a neat concept how all the teachers were a part of the play. The actors made this movie a good movie for kids and adults. I would give this movie four stars. I hope you will enjoy this movie too.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is quite possibly the most feel good movie ever to be made, I only wish I new French so that I didn't have to read the subtitles.  I've seen some bad reviews on this site that compared Amelie's cat and mouse game with Nino with the antics of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fud.  Maybe they missed the begining of the movie or decided that reading the subtitles was not important to understand what was happening.  Amelie's inability to confront Nino can easily be explained by her childhood and it's lack of social contact.  Simply put, this is a beautiful film full of imagination that will leave you with a smile on your face.  If you can get over the fact that you have to read subtitles for the 2 hours that this film spans then this is a must see.  Please watch it twice, read the subtitles the first time so that you know what is going on, the second time pay more attention to Amelie and the wonderful performance that Audrey Tautou gives.  I guarentee that you'll be hooked as well!
B00003ZKS1|5.0|The First 2 MSG albums (this one included) are Michael Schenker at ther Highest of his guitar/musical powers,in my opinion.<br />Well constructed Hardrock tunes, and GREAT GREAT guitar playing.<br />Any  young fledgling metal/rock guitarist should NOT be with out these albums.Schenker is up there with Randy Rhoads(I think Schenkers a more mature tastefull player than Rhoads btw) ,Malmsteen,Blackmore,VH  ect....
0385504209|3.0|My cousin raved about this book and suggested that I would love it since I'm a bit of a Renaissance buff.  Like the other reviewers, I found this an entertaining page-turner, but I'm a bit surprised to see references to his &quot;impeccable research&quot; since I recognized a number of inaccuracies off the bat and cursory research revealed several more. His stretches and distortions of history are forgivable--after all, it's a suspense novel, not a scholarly treatise--but it's a bit disturbing to see the faith with which readers embrace his dubious assertions. By all means, enjoy the story, but take everything with a grain of salt.  And don't read it if you're already knowledgeable about cryptography or religious symbolism and are easily irritated, since the cryptographer and symbologist make an excessive to-do over some fairly simple allusions.  I guess it adds to the thrill to be able to feel smug about solving all the puzzles before the experts.  Brown manages to make cabbalistic mysteries transparent and accessible, which is a logical contradiction, but what the heck, it's fun.<br />However, I can't resist quoting Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; (which covers the same territory with defiantly inaccessible flair):  &quot;The lunatic is all idee fixe, and whatever he comes across confirms his lunacy.  You can tell him by the liberties he takes with common sense, by his flashes of inspiration, and by the fact that sooner or later he brings up the Templars.&quot;
B0000AMRJC|5.0|No I'm not a rapper or even a fan of rap music, but I still love Scarface.  I won't get into the plot since everyone has already.  Let me just say that he plot is simple but it lures you in and doesn't let go until those closing credits begin to roll.  I've always loved Al Pacino and I have to say that this is his best performance!  The movie is gritty and violent but hey that's the world Tony Montana lives in so don't expect anything sweet and rosey.  You have been warned.  Also I wish these ignorant rappers would stop comparing themselves to Tony Montana, they're nothing but a bunch of wannabes and need to find their own niche.  You guys aren't Tony and you never will be.  That whole Def Jam crap is the only thing that ruins this DVD, just pretend it doesn't exist and enjoy everything else.
B000089RVR|3.0|Watching DIDO perform white flag on the new Ellen Degeneres show is what inspired me to buy her new album.  But after my first listening to the CD I was pretty disapointed.  But after listening to it a few times I have really grown to like it. There is nothing groundbreaking in it, but overall I think its a decent addition to my collection. Its best when used in a CD changer when playing random songs from various different CD's rather than listening to the whole CD alone. It could tend to get a little old. Bottom line there are songs on here that im glad I get to hear. I really like Sand in my shoes, Stoned, See you when your 40, dont leave home.....oh hell, they are all ok,.
B00004SZWD|5.0|The Beatles released close to a dozen albums of original material in 7 years. The Stones kept up with that schedule. Paul McCartney &amp; Wings were on the same output ratio. Elton John had a new album out every ten months. Even Led Zeppelin would never think of having more than 18 months between releases.<br />Stevie himself had annual releases before this. His last three, Fulfillingness' First Finale, Talking Book, and Innervisions all won Grammy Album of the year.<br />Then Stevie took two years to make this album. Two whole years.<br />And turned out a masterpiece. Sure, there's a couple of tracks (e.g. &quot;Black Man&quot;) where I'd hit the Skip button. But so many brilliant tracks! Such variety! Such virtuousity! It seemed incapable that any one person could produce all the types of music on this CD. Certainly, no one today is capable.<br />It was an instant #1 album, in a time when there were virtually no instant #1 albums, a complete critical and commercial success.<br />And the labels got the idea that if everyone waited two years between albums, they'd all be this good.<br />So two or three or more years between albums became the norm.<br />I'm still waiting for another album this good. It could be a long wait.
0140177396|4.0|In this book, Steinbeck bring us to a true world of  how guys search for their home and dream.The story cotains love and a careing man. It tells the love that two men can feel for each other.  He wrote a great story about guys in America, which he describe as of mice and men.The two main characters George and Lennie. George had no family and no friends, but he traveled along with a guy called Lennie all the time. Lennie was a dump, stronge man, he follows what George orders.He is just like a big baby, and he made troubles.They went to work in a range, inside the range they meet other workers. George told them his dream is to buy a piece fo land in S'pose and settle down. He promised Lennie that he would stay with him and let him to pet rabbits. The S'pose is the dreamland of every men.It is a quiet and peace place.From the book ,the rabbits told us how childish Lennie was, and why he made a bigger trouble. In between the  story there is a coloured man named Crook,the story has shown  how he was comletely isolated and brutal.He try to discourage Lennie by telling him George will not come back for him.There is another man Curley who dislikes Lennie, the son of the boss of the range.He was little, so he dislikes Lennie as Lennie is big and stronge.Lennie make another big trouble, he killed Curley's wife. Lennie did not mean to , he did not want George to be mad at him ,so he tried to ask that girl not to yell.As he is too stronge , he killed the woman. Lennie went to the brush, as he was told by George that whenever he made a trouble , he should hide in the brush near the river and wait for him.Lennie do stuggle of weather he should hide and stay with George. At last he went to the brush, George told him he was not mad at him ,and they will go to S'pose. Howerver, George killed Lennie, he was tired to a responsibility of Lennie, so haven is the place for Lennie.<BR>       I would recommand this book because the writer had a great work in writing Lennie.He clearly let us know how innoncent men were, sometimes they were small as mice. Also, he has good understanding of George. The contradiction George face. The story tell us how every men has a dream. They want a little bit of land, not much, just something that was his own. Also,the peoblems that they may come with in attending their dream. I think Lennie did noting wrong , he was loyality to George.For George i think he has no choice, he has to kill him. I can feel how sad George was when he killed Lennie. The story was touching when Lennie saw George in the brush, and George told him he will take care of him forever.It can show Lennie was right to wait George. I like the story because it tells me the truth side of human Nature! There is racism,innocent, contradiction and love.                     524 words
B00005O3VC|5.0|Summary:<br />King Arthur (Graham Chapman) has been commissioned by God (voice is also Graham Chapman) to seek The Holy Grail - the cup used by Jesus during the Last Supper.<br /> <br />Prior to the commissioning, Arthur gathers around him a group of knights who will join him on his quest, including: Sir Lancelot, the Brave (John Cleese); Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle); Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones); and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin).  As is customary for knights of the time, the group is accompanied by pages and minstrels, including: Concorde - Sir Launcelot's Trusty Steed (Eric Idle); Patsy - King Arthur's Trusty Steed (Terry Gilliam); and Robin's Least Favourite Minstrel (Neil Innes).<br /> <br />On their journey, King Arthur and his knights encounter a number of obstacles, including among numerous others: A homosexual prince, Herbert (Terry Jones), who is kind of 'saved' by Sir Lancelot.  And the priestesses of Castle Anthrax (Carol Cleveland - both Zoot and Dingo; Avril Stewart - Dr. Piglet; Sally Kinghorn - Dr. Winston) who lure Sir Galahad the Pure to their castle where he finds that they are only interested in sado-masochistic sexual punishments.<br /> <br />As the group tracks down clues to the location of the Grail they encounter an enchanter named Tim (John Cleese) who leads them to a cave that is protected by a voracious bunny rabbit that is only defeated by using the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.  Inside the cave, Brother Maynard (Eric Idle) translates some writing revealing the location of the Grail, but before the knights can storm the Castle of Uuugh, they are arrested for the murder of a modern day historian (John Young) who was filming a documentary on the Dark Ages.  The movie ends without the knights finding the Grail, but it was definitely a good effort.<br /> <br />Comments:<br />I think you can only appreciate this movie if you throw out the idea of a coherent story.  Yes, there is the basic idea of a quest,but there is no specific order as to what happens except it slowly moves toward the failed attempt to find the Grail.  The integration of the modern historian makes no sense, unless you watch the movie recognizing the limited budget they had.  As a matter of fact, the only way this movie makes sense is by viewing it in light of the limited budget.  Much of the influence of the budget is revealed in the special features on the DVD; especially affected was the location (they only used one castle).<br /> <br />Despite not being a coherent story, the movie is still absolutely hilarious.  Integrated throughout is witty social commentary (the peasant scene is probably my favorite scene of the entire movie) and some very blatant slapstick humor.  And, of course, it is all set to rather ridiculous animation that gives the movie an even more scatty feel than the mocking pythons do in person, but you have to laugh.<br /> <br />The acting, if it can be called acting, is actually quite brilliant.  The number of characters that each actor plays is stunning.  I'm not quite sure who can claim the greatest number of characters, but it has to be either Eric Idle or Michael Pallin, who both play at least six characters in the film.  This really isn't the type of film that requires acting in the traditional sense as what is really being done is something along the lines of a drawn out comedy routine that just happens to be on location and in costume.  Every element of every scene seems literally designed to make you laugh, which is at least part of the reason why people can watch this film over and over and continue to find things to laugh at - there is always something new to discover.<br /> <br />In looking back at my review of this film it almost feels like I'm not being very positive, but that is not at all the impression I mean to give.  Just because the movie is low-budget and rather slipshod does not mean this is a bad film.  Quite to the contrary, I believe it is these very elements that make this such a great film.  Once you have watched it once or twice you begin to realize that the low quality of the film, the silly locations, and innumerable characters each actor plays are actually part of what makes this film endearing to so many people and what has made this movie a legend.  I must recognize that this movie does not appeal to everyone (though I have the hardest time understanding why).  If you love cult classics or British humor and you have not heard of Monty Python and the Holy Grail you must have had your head stuck in the ground for the last thirty years, so there's no real sense recommending this movie to you because you probably already know about it and love it, unless you really did have your head stuck in the ground.  If you don't love cult classics or British humor you may still want to give the movie a go-around just to see what all of the fuss is about, but you may find that someone's pissed in this cup of tea and you don't want to drink it.  Or you may find a superb Earl Grey.  Either way, this is a must see movie, even if it's just to say that you've seen it and didn't like it.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Half of every QT movie is made by the soundtrack, and it truly becomes it's own character within the film.  Apart from the movie, these songs are really cool - and I'll never be able to listen to Bang Bang again without thinking of this movie.  By the way R Diep, the whistle song is on this disc, track 4 &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot;...
B0000057C5|5.0|this is the pinical of indutrail music the NIN and Rob Zombie are trying to reach. it is perfect in every way and has not left my cd player for more than one day. most people with true appresiation for music will do one of two things, buy this cd and lern all the songs in their original langauge (german) or go out and actually lern german to fully understand Till. it is just a great cd, and i am looking forward to buying the other two as well. auf weidersain!
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Let's be honest we're not buying this CD for the hits, we're buying it for the new material. \\"That's The Way\\"--Giorgio and Keith hit the nail right on the head. This has radio hit written all over it. Donna's vocals shine in this very slick, well produced production. Very breathy and playful. She hasn't used her voice in this way for years, and it's a very welcome change. This is the new sound of Summer and I like it! \\"I Will Live For Love\\"--Donna's previous co-writes with Nathan DiGesare haven't impressed me at all, but this song is a complete twist. Written for Donna's children's musical \\"Dreamway Express\\", the lyrics and the vocals scream classic Broadway. Giorgio lifts this fairy tale from standard theater fare, by wraping the production in enticing effervescent dance beat. \\"You're So Beautiful\\"-- Loved it. Although I would love even more to hear a version that features Donna's vocals more prominently. This at least proves that Donna was on the right musical track when she was at Sony. All and all, these new recordings show a Diva awaiting (and deserving) a rebirth. Will it happen? I can only pray. Mykol (I Wanna Love You Baby Like You Know I'm Donna Summer)
0385504209|5.0|I NEVER do reviews, but I felt this one was up to the task. I could not put it down! The beauty of having history involved with the mystery and thriller aspects was simply page turning. Did I mention I couldn't put it down? Thank goodness for fall, rain, a fireplace and a GOOD BOOK! I wished it went on on and on! Get it!
0804106304|5.0|Amy Tan has a great way of expressing the many relationships between mother and daughter.  You feel a certain connection to each one of them as their past unfolds before your eyes, containing their pain, happiness and secrets they have kept for years.  You understand the Chinese way is literally &quot;to desire nothing, to swallow other people's misery, and to eat [your] own biterness.&quot;  She also leaves you with a great ending that makes you satisfied in a sense that everything was resolved.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|For all you doubters, nu metal-freaks and especially METALLICA: This is what a great, intense, innovative and therefore classic album must sound like! Metallica, you especially should shiver and kneel when listening to DANCE OF DEATH! These guys put out their 13th release, are all older then you guys and sound so much more new fresh and cool! Why all the anger about METALLICA, why all the fuss? Because IRON MAIDEN simply have outdone themselves. DANCE OF DEATH seems like a review of 25 years of MAIDEN history with the best this band has ever produced during this time all combined and outlayered in 11 songs. All the major masterpieces of MAIDEN are revisited in DANCE OF DEATH, the wonderful keyboard atmospheres of &quot;Seventh Son...&quot;, the power and wrath of &quot;The Trooper&quot; or &quot;Number of the beast&quot;, the wildness and rock that always classified MAIDEN in the opener WILDEST DREAMS, which, being a straight rocker though not too original, is certainly an energetic piece to set the pace for the rest of the album. After the opener DOD gets better with every track to culminate in the wonderful final song which is more or less a wonderfully thoughtful ballad. I never expected MAIDEN to reinvent the wheel, I never expected them to totally sound different...they don't on DOD. That is certainly not bad. But I am really really surprised they managed to write 11 songs of such great quality. This is perhaps MAIDEN's best album. Don't dare to download that! It is worth every penny!!! Great record, not only for MAIDEN-fans! Buy it!
B00005JLT5|4.0|I admire Polanski for taking a broader look at the Holocaust, showing the divisions within the Jewish community in Warsaw and the help some got through the Polish underground.  Of course, it helps to have such a compelling figure as Szpilman to wrap this complex story around.<br />One gets a very strong impression of the devolution of Jewish life in Warsaw, as Szpilman's family is forced to reduce itself to increasingly more appalling conditions. Polanski takes in a large panoply of characters, showing just how difficult the situation was for all those involved.  The Germans are by and large faceless officers who carry out random killings.  The Warsaw Uprising is touched upon.  Szpilman seemed to have an angel on his shoulder, able to keep one step ahead of the Germans.<br />The situations are tense and unsettling but the film is perhaps a little too clean in terms of depictions and gives a little too glossy and account of the horrors of war.  Adrien Brody turns in a fine performance.  He seems to capture Szpilman's early disillusion and eventual degradation through the course of the war. Szpilman was a survivor, which contrasted sharply to the nihilistic views of his brother.
B000002LND|5.0|I must say that this album includes only but extremely famous hits!, I know many people said that Madonna left many songs out, but I must disagree with them, the hits are here, the so so songs are in the garbage ok!, this is a must have for everyone, the remastered versions sounds so nice, updated without losing that 80's feeling, if there is a Greatest Hits ever release worth it, this is it.
0393057658|5.0|I was finishing Moneyball during games 4 and 5 of the 2003 American League playoff series between the Sox and As and nothing could have been a more fitting ending to my combination reading/watching experience than the last at bat for the A's.  Details below:<br />Lewis does a fine job of detailing how the A's GM ends up drafting players who walk a relatively high percentage of time in order to build a team that scores as much runs in the regular season as the Yankees on 1/4 the payroll.  I was able to observe and appreciate many of the player decisions that Billy and Paul made empowered by sabermetrics.  Hatteberge would walk; Tajeda would swing, etc. etc.  Reading the book helped to reinvigorate my appreciate of baseball and each of 2003 playoff series.<br />If you recall the 8th and 9th innings of game 5 in Oakland, you will remember that the A's batters were successful in drawing a ton of walks.  In the 9th inning the Sox had walked a couple more batters and the As had the bases loaded.  The batter, Adam Melhuse does the job that Billy and Paul predict: he gets the pitcher to throw a ton of pitches until the pitcher either walks the batter or throws a strike (hopefully that the batter than handle).  The count is 3-2; the batter, Melhuse gets a pitch in the strike zone...and watches it sail into the catcher's mit (another A was caught looking on the 2nd out of the inning as well--see below).<br />I sincerely respect the job Billy and Paul have done, but all things considered it seemed fitting to me that when it came down to the last 2 outs, the As died with 2 of their 3 batters betting on the opposing pitcher's willingness to throw a ball 4 rather than their own ability to successfully put the ball in play.  I guess that's what you get for $40 million.<br />The Press Democrat<BR>OAKLAND -- Adam Melhuse sat quietly at his locker, fielding wave after wave of questions about what he did -- or didn't do -- just moments earlier.<br />Melhuse had been caught looking ata third strike when he needed only to put the ball in play to tie up the decisive game of the Division Series against the Boston Red Sox on Monday night.<br />After Terrence Long also struck out looking, sending the A's to a 4-3 loss that ended their season and disappointed the Coliseum crowd of 49,397, Melhuse tried to put it in perspective.<br />\\"It's not life or death -- it's just a game,\\" Melhuse said.<br />\\"That said, I'd have given my left foot to win that game. Literally, I would have chopped it off.\\"
B00004X01U|1.0|Besides Music, Don't Tell Me, What It Feels Like For A Girl and Impressive Instant, this album is full of boring tracks and sounds extremely like Ray Of Light drop outs!, this is Madonna at her worst.  Why she didn't stay with Pat Leonard?, the highlights of this albums, is that gave Madonna her 12th #1 single Music, and this lame album became #1, a Madonna elusive spot in the Hot 200 Album Charts, but with this, all the praise and Grammy nominations were vanished, what a bad album, if you want the worth tracks, buy GHV2. Sorry Madonna this album just don't click!
B00006BTCA|4.0|Despite all the references to Psychedelic Furs, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, and particularly Joy Division, it seems to me there's a certain something to this band that this combination provides that is unique.  It's hard to put my finger on it, but considering this is a debut album and the band is still searching for its direction, I am eager to see what comes of the future.  Just like Radiohead, I get the impression that they'll be able to forge something unique with the coming records, and there's a good chance their second could result in a Bends.  Tracks like &quot;Untitled,&quot; &quot;Hands Away,&quot; &quot;Leif Erickson,&quot; and &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; definitely point in some refined version of the band with its own direction.  The other songs, musically speaking, are as a whole pretty strong, though the two longer ones seem to overstay their welcome (&quot;The New&quot; has a deliciously tuneless guitar line towards the end, however).  &quot;PDA,&quot; while a definite Joy Division/Sonic Youth impression, is awesome and driving nevertheless.  In the end, this band is nowhere near as derivative as the Strokes, and deserves much more of your attention.
B000002NJS|5.0|The deepest album of Madonna since &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, Ray Of Light became the fresh air for an artist that had been in a battle downhill musicaly since &quot;Erotica&quot;, the flavor of this album is the same trough it all, deep lyrics with electronica sounds, the aproach of happiness in the world that surround you with fame are well crafted in the slow motion song &quot;Drowned World&quot;, the upbeat and uplifting should be rewarded to the greatest feeling provided by several tracks like &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, the beat ballads are represented by &quot;Frozen(dark and lovely), &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot; and &quot;To Have And Not To Hold&quot;, Madonna portraits her new spirituallity in &quot;Shanti&quot; and her recent motherhood on &quot;Little Star&quot;, this is an album that will leave you in a magical place and is meant to be heard like a concept album, not like the way is in GHV2, were the songs sound out of place, this is an amazing peace of art of the late 90's an a reaffirmation of an artist that deserves to be called an Icon of Music.
B0000C8AW5|5.0|I discovered this album late, after devouring Bob's greatest albums for years... and must say that it's one of the most under-rated works in his canon.  I don't make that assessment based on the songwriting, but on the performances.  This may be The Band's finest moment... Robbie Robertson's guitar work, particularly on \\"Going Going Gone\\" is a valuable lesson in understatement, in making the instrumentation serve the song.  Same with Garth Hudson's majesterial organ and Levon Helm's rock-solid drumming.  And Bob's singing is at its peak of expressiveness... it initiates his greatest vocal period, stretching through Blood On the Tracks and the first Rolling Thunder tour.  \\"Tough Mama\\" is just ultra-funky and drenched with sexual longing.  With all the talk of Bob's lyrics and gathering of great musicians, too little attention is paid to the ATMOSPHERE he creates in a studio just by his presence and attitude.  \\"Dirge\\" is an excellent example of this, as is \\"Forever Young.\\"  It sounds like Bob and The Band have just been touring for months and are chronicling tales of fleeting love on the road, but this wasn't the case-- they wouldn't tour until afterwards, but still manage to convey that mood.  The album was recorded quickly and it sounds like it, but in a good way.  I like the impulsive and laidback feel of this recording.  This remastered version is a nice improvement on the original.  Even if you're new to Dylan's catalog, this is a primo purchase.
B000002J2D|4.0|This 1978 album was my first Genesis album.  It's still a sentimental favorite of mine a quarter-century later, though there are several better Genesis albums.  Guitarist Steve Hackett had left, and the album was recorded entirely by the remaining members: drummer/singer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and guitarist/bassist Michael Rutherford.  This album and \\"Duke\\" mark Genesis' gradual transition from progressive rock to the pop of the 80s.  \\"...and Then There Were Three\\" is lyrically dark, but the music is less ponderous than on \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" and the songs are generally kept short.  The band plays well but not showily; the only solo of any length is Banks' synthesizer solo in \\"The Lady Lies\\".  Hackett's role in the band had gradually declined after Gabriel left, and Rutherford is able to fill it capably here (by the time of \\"We Can't Dance\\" and \\"Calling All Stations\\", his lead skills had atrophied).<br />The first half of the album is full of songs about mortality (and one about fighting over a contract with the record company, which may have felt like the same thing at the time).  The best of these is \\"Burning Rope\\", one of those Tony Banks songs where he strung together a bunch of stray riffs he had lying around.  The ballad \\"Undertow\\" is also strong.  A cowboy dies in the \\"Ballad of Big\\", and a snowman in \\"Snowbound\\".  The second half includes Rutherford's gold-rush story \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\" (along with \\"Back in NYC\\" and \\"In the Cage\\", one of three Genesis songs that start with the same shuffle-beat bass part), lost-love ballad \\"Many Too Many\\", Collins' sprightly \\"Scenes from a Night's Dream\\" (a tribute to Winsor McCay's \\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\\" comic strip of the early 1900s), the boozy \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\", and \\"The Lady Lies\\", in which a knight is defeated by a monster posing as a fair maiden.  The album ends with the single \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", which is so much more cheerful than anything else on the album that it sticks out likea sore thumb.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
0380977788|5.0|I bought Coraline for my sons, 8 and 10, because I thought it looked interesting. They both read it and yes they said they enjoyed it, so I also read it. Well I finished it last night and I could not sleep for hours afterwards. Now granted I'm a bit of a scaredy cat and afraid of the dark already, but I had not expected a \\"children's\\" book to so affect me. It was not just cheep scares but genuinely deep thought provoking scares. This book had me thinking about the nature of life, death, reality and fear for hours. I must say it was wonderful. The book is not very long, I read it in just the one day, but it packs a lot in a small package. I highly recommend it. I do hope that Gaiman puts out more for the adolescent crowd as I appreciate the ability to provide my children with intelligent, well written, scary, thought provoking books that I can share with them.

B00008EPN1|5.0|&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, Peter Gabriel's last album with Genesis, is a progressive rock classic, a (slightly padded) surrealist concept album telling the story of New York street punk Rael and his journeys in the underworld. Gabriel used to tell strange stories between songs while the guitarists changed tunings, and &quot;The Lamb&quot; was chosen to be extended into album length.  This is one of those albums that at first listen has you going &quot;what's so great about this?&quot;, but with repeated listenings, becomes a favorite. Genesis' playing isn't as showy as prog-rock peers like Yes and ELP (the only virtuoso musician is drummer Phil Collins) -- and as a result early Genesis takes a few listens to get accustomed to -- but the songs are just as original and musical.<br />The album ranges from great singles like the title cut and &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; to the menacing &quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot; (which foreshadowed the rage of punk, but in 7/8 time), the teen-lust &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; (compare the lyric with Richard Thompson's &quot;Read About Love&quot;, written 15 years later), a soulful &quot;The Chamber of 32 Doors&quot;, and great instrumentals like &quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot;, &quot;Hairless Heart&quot;, and &quot;Riding the Scree&quot;. &quot;In the Cage&quot; became a highlight of Genesis' live show for years to come. Steve Hackett contributes some nice guitar solos on &quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot;, &quot;The Supernatural Anaesthetist&quot;, and &quot;The Lamia&quot;, while Tony Banks provides some of his best keyboard solos on &quot;In the Cage&quot;, &quot;The Colony of Slippermen&quot;, and &quot;Riding the Scree&quot;. The band didn't really have enough material for a two-record set, and so the second half is padded with instrumental filler (&quot;The Ravine&quot;, &quot;Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats&quot;, the openings of &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; and &quot;The Colony of Slipperman&quot;). &quot;Lilywhite Lilith&quot; is a reworked excerpt from the early Genesis piece &quot;The Light&quot;.<br />(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)
B0000AXE8I|5.0|what is the matrix and what is reloaded? is it a philosophically hard look at life and the way we live it now? becoming too dependent on machines to do even the simplest of tasks such as talking. or is it just an overblown hollywood movie that royally sucked? many have said that the matrix reloaded was horrible but it actually wasn't. here was a film, a sequal no less, that had a lot to say on the hold that computers and machines already have on us now. as for the answer to the question of what is relaoded, well here goes. reloaded may just simply mean more of the same. sorta a weak variation on the 1st matrix but i think that reloaded refers to the never ending struggle between man and machine. always reloaed or reloading. i went the day this movie came out after work with the one that is my soulmate and our friend. we all truly thought this film was excellent. the 15 minute car chase is the best sequence ever put to film. this movie deserves to win more than the technical oscars that it will receive. are there bad scenes in the movie? yes, i will admitt that the rave scene was bad but everything else was excellent. and i want to add another viewpoint to the whole everyone's in rags and their shoes are horrid. yes they have all this wonderful technology down below and yes it's the 30th century. but you have to remember that relying on machines too much is what got them in this mess. they are using machines as little as possible so this dosen't happen again. if they were using machines to make great clothes and shoes the audience would probably think what idiots they are and they deserve what the machines do to them if they are that stupid to be makng the same mistake twice. anyway to sum all this up i offer this scene. after the movie me, my bf, and our friend are sitting around discussing the philiospy of this movie and discerning the meaning behind some of the scenes all over cheesburgers. if a movie can get you to talk philosophy over burgers then it has to be adamn good movie.

B000021Y77|5.0|This is a movie about two lovers who only have 15 minutes to change the course of their lives forever. Lola recieves a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni, telling her that he's lost a small fortune belonging to his mobster boss. If Lola doesn't help him replace it in the next 15 minutes, he's dead. The movie takes you through half a dozen different scenarios - what if Lola robs a bank? What will happen? What if Lola borrows the money from her father? What will happen? - It's a great movie that enforces the law of nature that every action has a reaction and every step in life that we take affects the next. I really enjoyed this film. If you don't like watching subtitled films, the dvd comes with English audio - so you can actually watch the film instead of trying to watch and read at the same time. Go watch it.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|After much anticipation and talk it is upon us. THIRTEENTH STEP. Expectations were high and personally I believe they have completely surpassed them. After first listen to the album in its entirety, I thought to myself how different it is. The songwriting is infinitely better and much more refined, the sound is experimental and the song just far superior its predecessor Mer De Noms. It begins with the unusual &quot;The Package&quot;. Serene yet also heavy. A brilliant opener and seg-way into &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;. The most predictable A Perfect Circle song on the album and an obvious single. The journey continues through many brilliant tunes. Beautiful and moving. Then the excellent &quot;The Outside&quot; Dark and heavy, Perfect. Unfortunately the journey trips up when it reaches &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;. It's quite a nice song in it's own right but it completely ruins the mood that has been so prominent the whole time. Things kick into gear once again with &quot;Pet&quot;. Another heavy disturbing song. The album comes to an end with &quot;Gravity&quot;. Maynard shows off his touching expression that adds such a level of dynamics that not many other vocalists could. My favourite songs are &quot;The Package&quot; &quot;The Outside&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot;. Yet the album is just mind blowing. Thirteenth Step is a completely satisfying album that should fill hardcore A Perfect Circle fans' expectations and may bring new open minded fans who appreciate such music.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a great foreign film, probably my second favorite (First being Run Lola Run) Amelie is absolutely adorable! You can watch it with english audio also so that you don't have to watch the movie and read the subtitles at the same time. worth watching.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! I read different bad reviews with this band for this CD but all the bad they could say was that it was old rock n' roll... well, yeah! Rock n' Roll rocks and for ever will rock on! Why not talk about how great they play, the energy they bring and the lyricis of the songs? Not just anyone can be compaired to the Rolling Stones like these dudes were! If you don't believe me, buy it, play it loud on the freeway and tell me it won't make feel free!!! So rock on Jet!
B00005JM09|1.0|This movie was pretty lame. It was a big waste of a beautiful summer day. T2 was a great sequel - this doesn't even compare. I hate when they bring the female version of the main character in - same thing they did with the karate kid. It just shows that they had to scrape the bottom of the barrell to find a story line. Not even a good storyline. The movie is full of horrible writing, and even worse acting. Arnold might be a cool guy, but he should be thankful his career isn't dependent upon this movie. The special effects were amazing, as they were in T2... but the movie was so bad, the effects weren't enough to save it. I don't recommend this one.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I am enjoying this CD.  I have purchased every one of Erykah's joints thus far.  And, each one that comes out seems to surpass the previous one.  Worldwide Underground does the same.  I have not listened to any other CD since buying this one.  Danger is my 6-year old's favorite cut.<BR>Those who do not like this CD are use to the same garbage that is played on the radio all day long.  This is a breath of fresh air as opposed to the degrading mess we have been hearing.<BR>I was friends with Erykah back at Grambling State University.  And, I must say I am proud of you girl.  You told me you would make it and you did.  The last time I spoke with you you were hunting a ride to New Orleans to sign your deal.  Congratulations, baby and hope to see you in concert soon.<BR>Peace and blessings, Jennifer from Alexandria
B00003CY6M|4.0|This is one of the better romantic comedies I have seen in a while -and I'm not just saying that 'cause I have a thing for John Cusack.<BR>John Cusack (Jonathan) meets Kate Beckinsale (Sara) in a department store while Christmas shopping.

0156027321|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; tells the improbable tale of a young man's battle against nature and himself. It is one of those rare accounts that is so fresh yet appears to be a tale older than the hills. A modern myth which could have been written at almost any time.<br />The book has essentially three parts: The first part tells us of the early life of the improbably named Piscine Patel, a son of a zookeeper living in India. Endlessly taunted about his name he re-invents himself as Pi - the irrational number, 3.1415927....<BR>An irrational name for an irrational story, perhaps?<br />Pi discovers God. In a Catholic church. In a Hindu Temple. In a Muslim Mosque. In one of the most memorable and funny passages from the early part of the book his three mentors - a priest, an imam and a braham - accidentally meet and are incredulous about Pi's religion-swapping ways.<br />The author would like us to believe that this is a spiritual tale, that we'll find God in it. I'm not very spiritual and I didn't but each to his or her own. It's certainly true that the second part of the tale, the meat of the story, which deals with a shipwreck as the Patels move from India to Canada, seems to have divine intervention. For me, though, I find it inside of Pi, not outside.<br />This second part is a beautiful, gripping, warming and chilling story about Pi's improbable survival in a lifeboat who's only other occupents are deadly animals. Little by little Pi has to battle the elements, himself and the other animals to survive. He has to become the alpha male. Slowly the story seems to get stranger and stranger, more improbable yet suprisingly deeply rooted in some sort of strange reality!<br />The last part of the book, a description of his recovery in a Mexican hospital and interview with representatives of the shipping company, provides a second version of the story. And we wonder - was this fiction within fiction. Did the tale really happen the way Pi said it did? The improbabilities burstfrom the page and we ponder his name. On and on we think about the tale. Wonderful, irrational Pi. 3.1415927 ...
B00009L1TA|4.0|The beginning starts off great - John Travolta &amp; some woman (sorry, don't know her name) on a military base questioning two soldiers who were the only witnesses to the other soldiers murders from their platoon. But the movie takes so many twists and turns that it was really starting to lose me. I even contemplated turning it off. Until the final twist of the end, which made the entire movie make sense and completely saved the entire script. It isn't exactly John Travolta's or Samuel L Jackson's best role, but it is a fairly good movie. One definitely worth watching.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Only Oliver Stone could of pulled off something like this. It's one of those movies that just sticks with you, whether you love it, hate it, or think it's okay.<br />Don't watch this movie expecting the feel-good movie of the year. Obviously, that should be the last thing you would expect from a movie titled 'Natural Born Killers' (or any other Oliver Stone movie). This movie makes you realize just how fragile the human body is, and makes you pray you never run into anyone half as mentally unstable as the main characters. However, just because there's lots of killing in it, this doesn't make it your typical action movie. This is satire of American culture at its best along with a bad LSD trip to make it interesting.<br />Some of the best moments in the movie are brief but haunting. One of the best scenes is when the main character Mickey Knox is being interviewed for television and gives his personal point of view on killing and why he does it, Oliver Stone's personal spin on the Heraldo/Charles Manson interview. It's too bad they deleted the court room scene though, but you can still watch it in the deleted scenes menu.<br />The best performance in the movie is given by Tommy Lee Jones who plays the hyper redneck prison warden. He plays it with a lot of energy and you know he's just waiting for one of the prisoners to  make a mistake.<br />The only problem with the movie though is that it can just feel like too much sometimes. So much over the top, cartoonish violence and zaniness can either make your mind wander off someplace, or it can hold your attention.<br />This movie won't appeal to traditional or mainstream movie-goers, but anyone who's into something different and something that can be both intelligent and low-brow at the same time should check it out.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all. It was at least 2 hours way too long and so boring I almost fell asleep a bunch of times. I do agree that the visual effects of the movie are amazing, but that doesn't save the movie at all. I can't believe that this movie earned all the hype that it got. The story is basically Leonardo Dicaprio grows up to avenge the murder of his father which he witnessed. The movie could have EASILY been made into a two hour film - it didn't have to be an &quot;epic masterpiece&quot;. I was really disappointed. I won't be watching it again. Huge waste of time.
B00009V7T2|5.0|As many reviewers have stated before me, this truly is the greatest album of the year, no contest. For those of you who are worried if these guys live up to ATDI, you have nothing to worry about. Not only do they live up to ATDI, they surpass them with an album far mor ambitious then anything has ATDI ever put out.<br />The album starts off with a haunting sound, a kind of prelude into journey about to come. Then the vocals kick in and you're hooked. Keep in mind that this is not like most albums today where the whole thing sounds more like a collection of singles then a complete work. Everything in it flows so well and every song demands a lot of attention to fully appreciate.<br />What I love about this album is that the guitars stand out so much in an age where mainstream music doesn't put much emphasis on them. Every note is perfect. The vocals are also nothing less then amazing, espcially when Cedric hits those high notes in 'Inertiatic Esp'.<br />However, this album isn't for everyone. One of the largest complaints are the ambient noises that seem to put the album to a pause. In one song, it stretches out for a whole 3 minutes! I personally don't see anything wrong with them and feel it makes a larger impact when the album begins to pick up again, especially in 'Cicatriz Esp'.<br />Buy this album if you have the time to devote your attention to something of this calibur.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite of 2002!<BR>Hugh Grant plays the funniest character of his career!<BR>And Toni Collette gives an amazing performance!<BR>I was so impressed with this movie when I rented it, I went right out and bought it and watched it again!<br />Will (hugh grant) is a good looking, womanizing, millionaire, loner who's main priorities in life are himself, buying CD's, watching TV, and making sure that his life stays exactly the way that he wants it.  But, when he invents a 2 year old son in order to meet single-moms, he meets a 12 year old boy named Marcus.  As Will tries to teach Marcus how to be \\"cool\\", Marcus teaches Will that \\"no man is an island\\".  Suddenly, Will finds his door wide open to new experiences and lessons.<br />A great movie. VERY funny, entertaining, heartwarming, with a great cast of good actors!!<BR>Watch it!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Matrix Reloaded, overall, is a phenomenal film, if only for the stunning visual effects, and brilliant fight choreography. Unfortunately, the film is a little too full of itself, and all the philosophical mumbo-jumbo does wear thin pretty quickly. The dialogue isn't exactly the greatest either, although there are some cool lines scattered throughout. While the non-action scenes do drag the film down (and are actually quite tedious), this is the DVD version, so of course... you can skip to the action! I love the Burley Brawl - it's incredibly intense, and stylish, and the visuals are mind-boggling. The Chateau scene, and the Freeway Chase are also pretty cool. One dissapointing thing about the DVD though is that the special features are pretty thin, and not particularly interesting for that matter - a big let down, especially since the original was such a benchmark for everything a great DVD should be. They'll no doubt try to cash-in with a 'special edition' or release a bonus disc, much like the &quot;Matrix Revisited&quot;... an unfortunate trend with DVD releases these days. But anyway, enough ranting... overall Matrix Reloaded is a great DVD and well worth your hard earned money.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I heard some bad word of mouth reviews about this movie, but rented it 'cause I watch everything John Cusack is in. I wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, I was impressed - but I'm not sure if it was because I went into the movie with low standards or because it really was just that good.<br />The movie is about a group of strangers who all get stranded at the same motel together because of a flood - one of the people just so happens to be a muderer being transferred by a cop to another prison. Murders start happening and everyone points their finger at the convict - until HE gets murdered. Then everyone turns frantic tring to figure out who the real murderer is. <BR>But, don't let my review turn you off - this isn't just a regualr old who-done-it-thriller. The ending has a great turn that changes the entire course of the movie. <BR>Well worth watching!
0060512806|5.0|So you want to break a code?<br />Noble undertaking.  Be careful, though.  What you learn might spur you to action.  And, in taking said action, your Enemy might realize you've broken their code.  They change it.  Suddenly, zap!  You're back to square one.<br />In Cryptonomicon, that's just the beginning.  In a book that spans from World War II to present-day, covering almost every continent, jumping back in forth in geography and time, you get the feel for connections that turn out to be more than coincidences.  It is almost as if the codes everyone tries to break suddenly come to life and take on personalities, and you are left to ponder how one piece of the code relates to another.<br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  Between the codes and code breaking, the numerous analogies Stephenson uses to explain how codes work (especially the bicycle chain), the injection of various Famous People (like Turing and... oh, you'll find out),and just the author's overall world view (similar to my own), I found myself unable to put it down.  Entertaining and informative.  <br />And... BUMJU EBTWW DUFRX DUQVK UMEBU FBVIB EVTOU XFHXV KZTVU PKXLM UMMXW XMUYW BAUM.  Off the tongue-in-cheek scale.  OK, not exactly a strong cipher.  But it's fun to work through, much like the book.  <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in codes or code-breaking, history (especially recent history), and security.

It did with me anyway. Perhaps this CD is a bit mellower than their other ones, but HEY, that still doesn't mean that it isn't any good. I really liked the way it was structured and laid out. DT definitely put some time and thought into this one.
0962477060|5.0|I've played the guitar (all styles from classical to heavy metal) for 16 years and I've never come across a more practical and concise learning tool than Fretboard Logic SE.  To some of the naysayers who've disparaged Mr. Edwards' use of his own semantics for decoding the recognizable patterns of the fretboard, I can only wonder if they can read English or if so whether they were reading the same book.  I've taken several years of personal lessons as well as university courses(for which I received good grades) that I did not gain as much insight as I did in the time I spent reading and practicing with the Fretboard Logic books.  It's true that these books are intended for serious musicians only, but since when has truly learning an instrument NOT required serious effort?  In my years of experience, these books are a serious bargain!
B00005K3O0|3.0|The great director Robert Wise who brought us \\"The Haunting\\" produces an original but muddled film about the theory of reincarnation.<br />A stranger starts to follow a schoolgirl around the place much to her parent's distress. During a confrontation with the stalker he explains that he believes that their daughter is in fact the reincarnation of his dead daughter who died in an automobile accident and asks them if he can spend a little time with the girl so that he can get to know her. The girl's farther dismisses the man as a lunatic but the mother is not so skeptical and after her daughter starts to experience nightmares and hysteria she begins to believe that the stranger is telling the truth. Cue lots of set pieces involving domestic problems, kidnapping, custody battles and a little girl who is plagued by unknown forces.<br />All in all this is more family viewing than a horror film and certainly not in least bit terrifying as it would have you think. The story also borders on the ridiculous at times, even though it is supposed to be a film about the supernatural. This is also one of the early works of Anthony Hopkins and you get to see him here as an actor on the up-and-coming. Overall, worthy of Sunday afternoon entertainment, but little more.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd was worth the wait. I only wish it were longer.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now is essentially a film about a soldier/assassin Captain Willard who is sent by the CIA and the US military (Harrison Ford has a brief appearance as the military operations manager) on a top secret \\"black op\\" to terminate the command of a Colonel Kurtz, a high ranking official, who has gone AWOL and started a cult in Cambodia right smack in the middle of the Vietnam war. Martin Sheen plays the assassin who is given the assignment and Marlin Brando is in the role of the AWOL Kurtz.<br />The film begins with a napalm scene inter-cut with haunting imagery to the theme-tune of the \\"The End\\" by The Doors and is pretty much a prelude of what is come. Willard undertakes his journey by boat with a four-man crew (Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms and a very young Laurence Fishburne) up a river, past the jungle and into Cambodia to reach his target. The crew are not aware of what exactly their mission entails but they tag along for the adventure - and most of them act just like the Vietnam war is one big adventure. Overall this is an excellent piece of cinema and must be seen in widescreen to enjoy the rich imagery and the full scope of the production and presentation.<br />Basically the film is about a number of \\"incidents\\" that occur during this mission to Cambodia along the river at various stop points. These interludes include: - a war machine run by Lt. Col. William 'Bill' Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who has traded in his ships for over a dozen squads of helicopters so that he can go \\"looking for the sh*t\\". His character is very memorable and the fight scenes are shockingly realistic including a very real napalm strike on a huge forest. He is also a little crazy and demands that his soldiers go surfing in the middle of a blitz - \\"If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!\\" - there is also a playboy show that gets a little out of hand - a visit to a predominantly black soldier battle zone that looks like the worst hell hole in Vietnam - a chance meeting with a colony and a very strange formal dinner - an encounter with a tiger and dangerous tribal locals, before finally reaching their destination which was the core reason why they undertook the mission in the first place. Kurtz mostly lurks in the shadows among his cult, whispering prophecies and describing his new founded command and his worshippers as beyond American military understanding. It is a huge performance from Brando that is both haunting and soul searching. There also is an outstanding performance by Denis Hopper, a photojournalist who is with the cult and babbles on about how \\"God-like\\" this Kurtz character is.<br />The movie is loosely based on the book \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad and is an essential film for anyone's collection. The REDUX version features previously cut footage but doesn't really add or subtract much from the film. I have enjoyed both versions and will stick with the REDUX version since this is what the film director, Francis Ford Coppola, wanted us to see. There is a lot of realism in the film that comes from a shoot that had tremendous problems along the way including sets that where swept away in floods and Martin Sheen having an heart attack in the process from all the work stress. If you can get your hands on the documentary making of this film \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" then do so because it is one of the best documentaries about filmmaking ever made. There is even a still photograph showing Coppola with a gun pointed to his own head. He threatened to commit suicide for real numerous times throughout the shoot.<br />This is probably the best Vietnam war movie but it is a lot more than just that. You will hard pressed to find anything quite like it. A modern masterpiece of epic proportions. Films just don't get much better than Apocalypse Now.ll hole in Vietnam - a chance meeting with a colony and a very strange formal dinner - an encounter with a tiger and dangerous tribal locals, before finally reaching their destination which was the core reason why they undertook the mission in the first place.

B000065V3M|5.0|This slow paced comedy might not be for everybody, but film buffs will love it. Tim Burton brings us this true story, two Oscar winner, about a film director/transvestite who is widely regarded by critics everywhere as the worst filmmaker of all time.<br />Shot in glorious monochrome, the story essentially documents the fall and fall (no rise) of the manic Ed Wood (Johnny Depp on top form) who managed to make a stream of low grade B-movie motion pictures with aged and failing Dracula star Bela Lugosi  (Oscar winning performance by Martin Landau) who just happens to be hooked on morphine at the time. Essentially the story is about Wood and Lugosi as one strives to make horror movies and the other strives to battle his addiction. Along the way they manage to pick up the most unusual of characters to help them with their productions. What happens next is a series of disasters, mostly comical in nature with very serious interludes involving Lugosi getting treatment for his problem.<br />Its wicked good fun, downright hilarious at times and the acting is on top form.
B00008UZPD|1.0|This is a really bad movie. Do not waste your money or time with it. If I could give it a negative star rating, I would.The premise of the film isn't original at all. I watched, waiting for a final twist, but it ended in the usual way. To compare this to the Matrix is an insult. It also trys to compare itself to Minority report. This does not ring true either.
B00005NB8K|3.0|Even though this movie has been slated by critics and is considered one of Oliver Stone's turkeys, it certainly is not uneventful. I had the pleasure of first watching this film after taken over 100 dried psilocybin mushrooms and even though I would not do that again as quickly, I must say that this film was an excellent choice at the time.<br />Basically the story is that there is none expect for the rise and fall of the music legend Jim Morrison. The film starts with his boyhood memories of an Indian car accident, his early film-school days (watch for the cameo of Oliver Stone as his film professor) and the formation of the band  - The Doors, which consists of the actors Kyle Maclachlan, Kevin Dillion and Frank Whaley. Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison and is completely believable throughout the entire film. The plot revolves around his relationship with Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan) who battles for his love and attention as Morrison takes on a God like status in the world of sex, drugs and rock n' roll.<br />Stone decides to concentrate more on Morrison's descent into self-destruction and there are plenty of tragic gigs gone wrong along the way. The film is very mystical in parts but ends up saying very little. It is more about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of a big time rock n' roll star than anything else. Wonderful camerawork though and amazing lighting. The script is somewhat weak but there is still plenty of stuff that keeps this film moving forward.<br />And yeah, it was better with the shrooms, in case you wanted to know. 4 to 5 stars with shrooms, 3 without.
B00007GZVS|4.0|The movie was very entertaining.  It was more of a serious movie, and not a comedy.  If you are simply not into history, it is worth the 1 1/2 hours to watch the setting and beautiful costumes.  It takes you right into the time of when it was supposed to take place.  Even though it was not entirely historically correct, it still gave you a great over view of the history, and the scandals of the monarchy, which was what made it entertaining.  It also showed Elizabethan monarch, and the turmoil that was going on at that time.  It was great to see that Queen Elizabeth was able to stay in power for over 20 years as a female, without getting married.
B00005R1N3|3.0|Even though this film doesn't even come close to &quot;Halloween&quot;, it was the original POV (point of view) hand-held camera stalker movie... you know.... where the camera acts like it is the eyes of the killer.<br />Anyway the plot is pretty much your run-of-the-mill deranged serial killer on the loose stalking girls in a university sorority house type horror movie, but it does boast some inventive camera shots, lighting and scares. Even though the film does not have the same kind of impact now, it was certainly a very frightening movie for its time.<br />A girl from the sorority house goes missing, a killer moves into the attic upstairs, strange phone calls are made to the house, a child is found murdered in the park and one of the girls has strange thoughts about an abortion as her boyfriend pianist begins to loose his mind.<br />The acting is pretty tacky but you will find actors like Keir Dullea (2001: A space Odyssey) playing a lead role in this movie. There are also a few other actors who went on to do better things - Margot Kidder (Superman) and John Saxon (Nightmare on Elm Street).<br />Overall there are a lot worse \\"slasher\\" movies out there but there are also a lot of better ones. Anyhow, you might as well see the original POV \\"slasher\\" movie if you haven't already. It is not that bad ... but it is not that good either. Sort of middle-ground horror hokum.
0783240503|3.0|The movie is bad.  They sing the entire time and it sounds horrible.  There were a few things that were good, but overall the movie was bad.  The plot was fairly good, but I just can't stand the singing. The movie would have been better without the singing.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Forget purchasing anything else ever again.  Once you buy this album your life will be complete and full.  <br />The best song in my opinion?  The beautiful balad bonus track: Sleeping Sun.  This album is woderful.  The lyrics are relevant, thought provoking, poetic.  God himself could not make a better album (unless he became a member of Nightwish, then perhaps he could).  <br />But seriously, buy this album.  The neo classical opera metal band is the best thing to ever grace existance.
0613281292|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book. And while the movie told the story well, there is no comparison to the book. Jamie and Landon are the epitome of first love -its happiness and its pain.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I still feel a bit saddened that so many people have a tough time enjoying this movie for what it is. Every note, to me, was pitch perfect. (Ok, the dance/rave went a bit long, but I think I understand the intent of the scene. More on that later...)<br />Sure, some could say the battle/fighting sequences go on a bit - then again, many in the audience probably came only for the fighting.  The writing, story and ultimate meaning of The Matrix Reloaded deliver movie science fiction at the highest level.  Sure quibbles here and there can be found, but one must remember this is a science fiction joy ride. It also happens that the ride offers willing passengers some rather meaningful thoughts along the way. <br />I found the story to be plausible, it pulled me in enough to go along for the ride - with the concept and truths the storytellers were trying to share.  I find this move timelessly relevant.  And people might enjoy this more if they judged this in the context of this being the middle part of a three piece composition.  This movie makes the first Matrix all the more enjoyable and the upcoming finale highly anticipated.<br />There are many levels to this movie that some reviewers, I am sorry to say, seem to be missing. I believe some of the reason for the violent negatives against this sequel has to do with the deeper meaning/points of the story more directly coming to light here in Reloaded. Maybe some find those meanings offensive to their political and/or religious leanings?  For example, the Matrix message is now more clearly evident as being beyond just a \\"shoot 'em up action flick\\", is \\"wrong\\" to those people now willing to give up their liberties for \\"safety\\" in this post 9/11 world.  The point of the Matrix movies is that, at least in part, reality as it is normally \\"presented\\" is something that deserves more attention, more scrutiny and more questioning.  Digging deeper into such reality can be scary and/or uncomfortable for many.  The status quo is, afterall, usually easier.<br />Matrix Reloaded is everything the last two STAR WARS movies are not! If only such writing and creativity behind the Matrix movies invigorated these, so far, bland and leaden Star Wars sequels.<BR>As far as all the complaints about the \\"orgy\\" scene: it was a rave - people having fun and DANCING. Doing, being and behaving as humans, doing something that gives them humanity the computer programs can never \\"get\\" as authentically.  Morpheus was solemn about the task ahead and then essentially said revel in who you are, enjoy and have fun as you are uniquely capable...for afterward it is for these such things - our ability to be free and human -  that the battle is joined.<br />By the way, my impression of the only way to \\"win\\" this Matrix battle is to co-opt the adversary by influencing them (corrupting their program) so they alter their way of thinking - seeing the benefit of each side surviving. We get a taste of that in this movie from the Oracle and also when we meet the Merovingian \\"programs\\" that have developed an intense appreciation for the finer pleasures of beauty, taste - even love. This person/program (Monica Bellucia) has become a voluptuary who has learned to enjoy much of what machine-like thinking is unable to appreciate - whether an actual machine or by humans who have become like machines in their rigid and controlled lemming-like following of whatever they are spoon-fed.(It is easier that way, isn't it?)<BR> <br />Interestingly, Mr. Smith, as he was corrupted with greater \\"awareness\\" as well, chose a darker path. As long as people are kept fighting and agitating and wanting, they will find that it is harder to open their eyes to other ways of resolving disputes, of working together to help each other. So, the battle is perpetuated...which leads to the need for more machinery, rules, \\"order\\" - instead of those resources being used for higher ideals.<br />Think about television in this regard. Television is most primarily an advertising medium, the \\"entertainment\\" is in service to that reality.  So, the entertainment - be it news or comedy or drama - is there to get you ready (to be conditioned) for those ads.  Those ads work best if you don't feel as good about yourself.  Then the products come to the rescue...to make you smell better, look better, be happier, more wealthy, more safe etc. If you are fearful of loss of something, then brush with this, wear that, drive this, take these pills.  The ads perpetuate those feelings of inferiority and unhappiness so that the shows take your mind away for awhile...and then back to commercials. More and more as time has gone on, the money/advertising aspect has been allowed to overpower and corrupt any other purpose of the mass media. This influences all media and all people.  Kinda Matrix-like, it isn't good for us, but we have gotten to the point where we do not realize that greater reality.  Like sitting in a pot of boiling water, by the time you realize what is happening, you are cooked. <br />(At the very least, \\"watch\\" what you watch, be a bit more mindful to how too much of that \\"reality\\" can keep you from deeper realities of human interaction and awareness of some of the other things going on in your life and the world around you. And remember, you are being \\"sold\\"... not only products, but also ideas, a way of life, a belief system that is not necessarily in your interests.  For example, it is becoming more and more handy for powers that be to have a populace that is afraid.  This will allow the rationale for more power given to those who can \\"protect\\" us.  A story told time and time again throughout history.  Follow the money.)<br />My tv screed is just a handy metaphor for how we can willingly allow a \\"Matrix\\" of reality (that is unreal) to gradually overpower us; and why I believe the story of the movies is so ingenious (the ideas aren't necessarily new, but to showcase them so creatively is) and popular.  It resonates.<br />Some may find the above thinking beside the point of going to see The Matrix movies. Maybe they just think the movie stinks.  That is perfectly fine.  However, it is a bit harder to fathom how those who say they enjoyed the first movie can despise the second. It is most likely they will dislike the third as well.  Maybe all they saw was a bang-bang, cool special effects and new-look \\"show\\" and just did not wish for much more than that. Those sorts of movies certainly seem to do well at the box office too.  <br />But, again, The Matrix stories can offer you much more.  I enjoyed the layers of ideas and meaning of these Matrix movies just as much as the visual fireworks.  And I give the moviemakers credit for trying to present such ideas while also working to make a film as popularly appealing to as many people as possible. Not an easy task.<br />Choose wisely the pill(s) you take.
0783240503|3.0|To me, the video was ok, but it wouldn't exactly be a preference to me. It was comical in some parts, and the plot flowed smoothly. I didn't like the fact that is was a musical, but I believe it portrays the theme very well. And in the musical sense, there are songs for just about any type of music fan. They have everything from slow ballads to upbeat disco. The best song was probably when the pharoah imitated Elvis. I would highly recommend this movie to you musical fans out there, and even some others.
B00005JLEU|5.0|&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a masterpiece, there's no other way to describe it. Miyzaki has created a unique, bizarre, slightly disturbing, always charming and fascinating animated world unlike any you've ever seen.<br />I'm not much into Japanese anime, and I haven't seen any of Miyazaki's other films, but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; puts to shame many of Disney's more recent movies ... as a matter of fact, I like it more than &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; which is saying something.<br />What a magical movie. It is completely unpredictable, but once you get started watching it, I challenge you to walk away. The animation is at once startlingly realistic and beautifully surreal. You are inside an environment that feels both ancient and brand-new. It tells the classic hero story, populating it with characters that are fresh and interesting, and there's no shortage of insight into human behavior, something the very best &quot;cartoons&quot; are careful to include.<br />My favorite characters are, of course Chihiro, the little girl who changes from a whiney, self-centered, materialistic brat into a more mature person capable of caring for others and taking responsibility for herself; Yubaba, the amusingly large-headed witch who runs a bathhouse for disembodied spirits and is by turns villainous and sympathetic; and No-Face, the mysterious apparition whose timid behavior masks a monsterous appetite for affection. I also love Yubaba's &quot;bodyguards,&quot; three freakish green heads that literally tumble about muttering &quot;oy, oy,&quot; and ... well, all of the characters are wonderful. See the movie and you'll understand.<br />&quot;Spirited Away&quot; overflows with glorious imagination, rivaling &quot;Lion King&quot; for the top spot as my favorite animated film. My point is this: see this movie! You'll be glad you did.
B00006JDVV|1.0|There is nothing negative I can say about this dragonless film that hasnt already been said other than this would have been a pretty good made for TV movie, but as a major motion picture its totally unacceptable. Dinotopia on ABC had more reptiles running around in it. Rob Bowman you owe me $8.50
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Ok. Thats about all I have to say about this movie, the overdone special effects, the akward scenes, the zion rave, all dragged the movie down, if they had balanced out the action and the plot laying like they did in the first matrix it would have been really good, but they put in a bunch of plot laying dialoge and then expect to make up for it with a totally overdone action scene. Even though they did this it was still a decent movie. I think it mostly served the purpose and getting us ready for revolutions.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I'm not exactly &quot;music savvy&quot;, but I have been of fan of alt/country/rock for a while. I can honestly say that I love everything about this album. I can literally listen to it evert time and find something new about it to enjoy.  The lyrics are amazing and the music itself incredible.  This album is hard to pigeon-hole into a genre, it's just pure-and-simply rock&amp;roll perfection.

B00006ZCFH|4.0|Ms. Badu has once again surprised us, thinking out of the box, and coming up with another set of vibes that explores words and sounds set to music. It is experimental at best and worth a listen with an objective ear. If you are expecting Baduism, forget it. If you are expecting Mama's Gun, don't think about it. The best thing I have learned to do with Erykah's music is to just not think or compare, but listen with a blank canvas and let her paint the picture for me. And what a wonderful picture she paints!      Erykah is obviously influenced by the Chaka Khan school of vocal delivery. A fan herself, Erykah, has studied Chaka's way of phrasing and delivery. Songs like Bump It, Danger and I Want You borrows heavily from 70's Rufus funk and Erykah's voice floats across the surface like a butterfly. Most of her phrasing is so ran together as if it is one long sentence that even she realizes what she is doing because on 'Danger' someone asks, &amp;quot;What did she say?&amp;quot; and she cuts out the music and recites the lyrics for clarification. She is in on the joke so to speak and realizes that clarification is needed. Great addition to the song!      Like D'Angelo and Outkast, Erykah is committed to putting out material that doesn't necessarily warrant big returns in album sales, but captures a broader fan based not listening to the music for a hook and a catch, but the creativity of the experimentation that will only satisfy a true music lover. Are these songs radio friendly? No. But are they sit back, relax, chill out lessons in music appreciation? Yes. In short, Erykah's musical tapestry is what makes legends. Just look at the pioneers of doing their own thing: Ella, Sarah, Stevie, Aretha, Frank and Tony. Like these artist, Erykah is a trendsetter...not trendy. I'm digging your Underground, Ms. Badu.
B000067CPX|1.0|The Red Hot Chilli Pepper's latest CD is a formulaic, cynically commercial, over-produced disaster.  It seems that the Red Hot's hit on a good thing back in the 90's with the tune 'Under the Bridge' and realized the potential for gold with that type of song so they tried a couple of new tracks based on a similar formula on their smash release 'Californication'.  Given that CD's success, they decided to go even further on 2002's 'By the Way' and create an entire CD of music derived from that one song 'Under the Bridge'.  If you like stupid 'aaaahh-aaaahhh-aaaaahhh' harmonies and the overdone pretty-style vocals of Anthony Kiedis (circa Under the Bridge and Californication), insipid lyrics, and down-tempo coma-inducing music, this CD is for you!  <br />As an aside I am planning on purchasing a tranquilizer gun loaded with heroin cartridges and smuggling it into the Red Hot Chilli Peppers next concert then shooting Anthony Kiedis, Flea and Jack Sherman with it. Voi La, the return of the good old days.<br />You will like this CD if you like Matchbox Twenty, Nickleback, Default, or generic alt-rock pretty sounding loud/soft style music.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I have to say that the first matrix movie is one of the best movies of all time. Maybe it was because the first one was so good that i was expecting a little more from this flick. First off the plot had a few problems. It was difficult to follow the movie at some points because the characters just kept rambaling on and on, like when Morpheus is giving the speech to the people of Zion. That scene just shouldnt have been in there. Second, although the fight scenes were really cool, they had no point. I mean they were cool. You could just watch the movie for these scenes alone but they really had no purpose. Take the scene were Neo is fighting all the Smiths. If Neo could just fly away at any point why did he fight them in the first place for like 10 minutes before he flew away. Its just stupid things like this that bring the movie down. But dont get me wrong. I bought this movie the day it came out, which is today and i really enjoy. It is a strong movie with a good plot and good action scenes. Like i said i think i was expecting to much because the first movie was so great.
