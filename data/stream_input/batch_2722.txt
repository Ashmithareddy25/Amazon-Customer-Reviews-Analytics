B006M9NJFG|3.0|I was expecting it to be this big. I haven't really tried it yet but I think that it will do the purpose just fine. I like how the aluminum cup just kind of snaps on the bottom and it all fits in the carrying case.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|It was slow paced and difficult to play on my kindle.  Probably will delete it.  When I play games I want faster action and clear rules, and most of all to relax.<br />Was none of this.
0307271080|5.0|Loved it!  The book is big but it's a page turner.  Fascinating story. I highly recommend this book and all of Ms. Adichie's books!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|The author's way of describing London, the war, the characters, and history are remarkable. Takes you right there. Going back and forth between time periods keeps the reader on their toes. The story line is one I'll not forget and made me never want to put the book down!
B009K0OL06|4.0|Entertaining....somewhat grandiose at times, but a good distraction from the hectic humdrum of everyday life.<br />I recommend the series as a good break during a stressful week.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a Fun challenging game game wish you could access access more levels right from the start though good luck.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good post apocalyptic show, there is action in every episode. The show is not only about humans against aliens, there is a twist of humans vs. humans,  humans vs. aliens, and later aliens and humans vs. aliens.
B000031WD9|5.0|this movie starts you out. By introducing you to this group of characters. And such you up to be interested in watching the rest that come after.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great story, great book. Enjoyed from start to finish. It's a quick read, too. Highly recommended and will open your eyes to a new perspective on life.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got this for my daughter and she loves it. At first it didn't want to stay completely closed very well, but after a week or two it works perfectly now and she has received compliments on it from her friends.
0545091020|5.0|The hunger games brings you into a world you never want to see. And very quickly grabs a hold of you and won't let you go into you finish the book. You just have to know what's going to  Cat. At the end of the book you hope her world will be better. But you have the feeling that it won't.

B0038NN3B4|5.0|He also suggested this book to help me in the process.  The program is explained well and makes sense, but it is hard to give up all my delicious fruits, especially at this time of year.  I know I can eventually add some back into my diet, but it will still be at much smaller portions than what I've enjoyed in the past.  I haven't been hungry using this approach, but still miss the fruits.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|But I wasn't that impressed with it.  I will admit that I haven't played it all that much yet.  Maybe it will grow on me, with time.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Completely different in tone from Ender's Game, but an excellent continuation of Ender Wiggins' journey. Actually think I may have enjoyed it more!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|AMAZING! Need to continue this game because it really is fun and also a good mind working game! Thanks a lot!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I bought Love Letter on a whim and it has quickly become a friend favorite. I often end up playing board/card games in mixed company-- some patient folks willing to learn, and others who hate complicated rule sets. Love Letter is PERFECT for those friends who want to play something fast, fun, and never bother picking up the rule book.<br /><br />The average round of Love Letter is short: maybe 5-10 minutes at most. The rules of each card are simple and written right on the card, so it's rare for a player to get confused.<br /><br />When I heard how short this game could be, I assumed it was probably dull, or lacked replayability. Not the case! There's an element of randomness in each game that keeps you on your toes about your strategy, as well as eyeing the strategies of other players. It's a much \\"smarter\\" game than I expected.<br /><br />The basic idea of Love Letter is to deliver a romantic note to the princess by being the last man standing, or the highest man on the totem pole when cards run out. You only ever hold one card in your hand. When it's your turn, you draw a second card, and choose to discard one of the two you're holding. You must do whatever the discarded card says (most cause you to interact with another player, ranging from viewing their hand to forcing them to discard). You can use force-discards as a strategy to be the last man standing, or you can try to hang on for dear life with a high-ranking card, hoping no one forces a discard out of you before cards run out!<br /><br />I'm not always a fan of \\"screw over your neighbor\\" games, but this one is well-balanced and fun. I think Love Letter is a must for anyone who loves to play games with friends.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its just Great, i used this book a lot it has a lot of new age words in it. Very very helpful
0307463745|5.0|I'm not typically one to read this type of book, but I listened to a friend's recommendation and picked up Rework anyway. If you're looking for a no-filler, easy-read, inspirational book that will leave you feeling like you're ready to start something awesome, you've found your item here.<br /><br />Rework is filled with advice for the modern self-starter. If you've always wanted to start your own business, design a software tool, or even just better yourself as a career-minded person, you'll find this book chock full of wisdom on how to be no-frills effective. Each pearl of advice averages a page or two long, but is inspirational, engaging, and contains useful examples of how that advice can be applied in real world situations.<br /><br />I consumed (this is the most appropriate word I can think of- maybe even 'devoured') Rework in two sittings. I came out of it amped to improve my process at my current job, as well as start a little side project.

B0018Q4DTY|5.0|Although in my opinion this their weakest album, it is still a classic. I remember when this album first came out. Outkast made us wait two years for it and it was worth it.

B00355L2TU|5.0|I recommend this workout to any and all who want to get into shape. (Still trying to convince my bf to do it as well ;) The 30 day shred is broken down into three levels that truly build upon each other to attain the best results. When it comes to working out, I need a structure to keep me accountable and her compilation of exercises is just that. You can feel yourself getting stronger throughout the week and that, for me, is motivation in and of itself.<br /><br />I am 5'1&#34;, so I have to supplement this workout with some additional cardio (nothing major, 30min of walking per day) and after one week I am seeing major results.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|a quirky film that I would recommend to all my friends. Was surprised with how much I enjoyed. Check it out!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Would be a great improvement if you were able to start at a checkpoint after a crash, rather than re-starting from the beginning every time.  Sure fun to play though!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Starts out slowly with pronunciation instructions. For me, even after getting through this part it was difficult connecting with all of the characters. However, if u stick with it u will receive ur just reward ... the continuing story of Ender' s life. Having read the 1st book in this quintet, I loved the next phase of Ender' s saga. I know I haven't said much but I'll say this, SPOILER, Ender finds love. Good book but I really think u should read Ender 1st.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I ignored this show for years - assuming network TV programming just couldnt hold a candle to cable programming.  Boy, was I wrong!  I love the storylines and even tho some of the dialogue is a little schmaltzy -- I am definitely hooked.
B005DZMNHA|4.0|This is sort-of a comeback album for Chris Rea.  The fact that he is still playing such great music is a testament to his talent, strength, and love of music.  Let's hope there are a dozen more!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|There really is something for everyone in this show, action, romance, and even humor.  Although they are story book characters, they are characters with depth and flaws, which they are willing to admit to and try to overcome.  It is a wonderful show that appeals to all age groups from all walks of life.

B000W9399S|4.0|I never knew that it's possible to laugh from reading a single sentence in a novel to the point of a stomach ache. I also didn't know that it is possible to laugh like this after reading the seconds sentence, and the third, and by the end of the page develop a chronic case of rolling on the floor and emitting strange noises that to a passerby would sound like choking, but are nothing at all like that. The Color of Magic is my first Terry Pratchett book (well, after Good Omens, of course, but that doesn't quite count, does it?), and I wonder what on earth has been preventing me from reading him, no, not from reading him, but from plunging deep down the spiral of ridiculously inventive, hysterically funny, and impossibly magical Multiverse of Space and Creation and other stuff called Discworld. I am hooked, I am converted, I am enamored with the eight color, the color of magic, octarine, and all the repercussions that come from this land of the turtle, and the elephants on top of the turtle, and the disc on top of the elephants, and the wizards on top of the disc, and... Err, well, I'm supposed to give a little summary here, right? Right. Here goes.<br /><br />The unlikely wizard Rincewind, or not a wizard at all, because he got kicked out of his wizarding school, but sort of a wizard, because he knows one very powerful spell, by some unexplainable streak of Fate (or maybe it is explainable) stumbles upon the path of an unlikely tourist Twoflower, or maybe not a tourist at all (don't ask me why I said that), traveling to the legendary city of Ankh-Morpork, accompanied by his pet luggage that likes to snap off people's hands, especially those of thieves. Oh, did I mention that there are no accidents here? In fact, both Rincewind and Twoflower are just pieces in a game played by Gods, but somehow they manage to elude what's been planned for them, even elude Death to his great disappointment, and a ton of menacing tree-nymphs, and trolls, and dragon riders, and demons, and finally get to the very edge of the world (it's on the disc, remember?) and... And what? Don't look at me. You'll have to read it to find out. Oh, I forgot to mention, every single step in their adventure is documented with a magic picture box, you know, the one you point and click? Did you know it's operated by a tiny demon? Yeah, neither did I. I haven't read The Light Fantastic yet, I suppose there Terry will explain it. He has no other alternative.nd finally get to the very edge of the world (it's on the disc, remember?) and... And what? Don't look at me. You'll have to read it to find out.

B006Z9K97E|5.0|This book is well worth purchasing.<br /><br />The only downside is a rush to the end without covering some NB issues such as escaping from china to South Korea
B007URVZJ6|5.0|i looked at several help sites on the web and they all made me feel that this was impossible  then i found a site that compared different sources of help and they recomended you what a blessing .

B0094BB4TW|1.0|Works fine horizontally but when I turn it, it fails. FIX IT PLEASE. I use this app all the time and it works better vertically. But now that's not an option.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|I'm in love with this woman - she is sooooo beautiful she makes me rend my clothing. My wife quite likes her which is indeed flattery: I have 1800 CDs and my wife has 7, two of which are Cliff and one Jim Reeves. She's not sure how the CD player works which is why I haven't bought her an 8th disc. But back to Caro: I discovered Miss Emerald late because her undoubted talents have had no airtime in New Zealand until I accidentally heard a clip of Tangled Up on radio and had to email the station to find out who she was. I was passing card details to Amazon within the hour, having raided youtube for clips: try the NRJ version of Night Like This and you'll burst into tears as I did. If Amazon gets the dvd of this session I hope they'll extend me the courtesy of letting me know.<br /><br />Anyway - I digress. The Shocking is a carry on from the first - I love Cutting Room Floor though I think the bits on this album make up a better whole...but you'd have to be hypercritical to pick a loser between these two discs. As with the earlier, Shocking has not a bad track on it: I'm with Pack Up the Louie (I'd appreciate someone explaining that to me), Coming Back and Liquid Lunch - the only song about a hangover I can think of. Buying Cutting Room without Miss Emerald is clearly deranged. As far as I'm concerned, Caro can stop recording now: her opus is complete. But I'm in for the long haul, so I'll buy anything with her name on it. :+]
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The story line was somewhat hard to follow.  Maybe if I knew my history better I would have understood the film better.  My husband didn't care for the movie at all, but I was really into it.  I would recommend it.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|Only once a decade does one get blown away by a new artiste: the last in my catalogue were MCR (Black Parade was where I came in), Alabama3 (Exile), and before that, I think, it must've been Queen (Night at the Opera). Caro Emerald has, with this CD, brought period jazz to the common man, and in such a way as to make it both acceptable and wholly desireable. In simple terms, here's a woman who from a standing start, can sell out any auditorium anywhere at premium prices only four years into her career! Beat that! I'm not sure anyone else can boast that. Maybe Mumford and Sons? Can't think of another likely candidate.<br /><br />Anyway, this is 30's jazz like never before - sure, there are the amusing little lines which are so out of place, but you get that when songs are written in English by those for whom English isn't their mother-tongue. Roxette, Pussycat and even Abba suffered from that; but the music is perfect - compulsive beats and memorable melodies make this the best new disc I've bought in years. Not a bad track on it.
B00BHXUC4S|4.0|Jeff Lynne has produced one of his best works to date. There are still touches which show his appreciation of The Beatles, but it works to fill the CD with many great tunes.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Wonderful movie, great CG and action to spare. A great retelling of the old fable. Has a interesting twist at the end as well.....
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book really touched me. It was well wrote and spoken, And anyone could truly relate to this book. Its 3:45 in the morning i just couldn't put the book down. I'm not going to give spoilers but definitely get this book if you enjoy books that you can relate too, have good concept, and change the way you see things in general and in people. I got angry at some characters and cried for some but in my opinion i like it when authors change to different characters so you fully understand every bodies points of views but if you don't like that it could definitely go on your cons list but id recommend the book anyways. I related to every character and i just loved the book. 5 stars i would of given it 100 stars if i could of thougj

B0002234LS|4.0|Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is an author suffering from writers' block after discovering his wife Amy (Maria Bello) in bed with another man at a motel. He retreats to their cabin in the woods in search of inspiration when a mysterious stranger, John Shooter (John Turturro), turns up and accuses Rainey of plagiarism. Shooter leaves a copy of his short story `Sowing Season' with Rainey who is surprised to find it does indeed strongly resemble a story of his own, `Secret Window'. The title refers to a window in their cabin beneath which his wife was to have planted a flower bed so that she could look out on it. Rainey then finds his dog has been killed (obviously suspecting Shooter) so reports this to the local sheriff, Dave Newsome (Len Cariou), who isn't really interested. So Rainey decides to visit the home he shared with Amy to recover the original MS. Unfortunately, the house is burnt down and Raney's original MS is lost in the flames. Raney suspects that all these incidents have been caused by Amy's new boyfriend, Ted Milner (Timothy Hutton). So he hires an old friend of his, Ken Karsch (Charles S. Dutton) to investigate. When Rainey gets back to the cabin he finds Ken and the only witness that Shooter even exists killed. The story is a bit involved but it's quite a gripping plot, extremely well-acted by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast, based on a book by Stephen King, and with the movie directed by David Koepp.

193700788X|3.0|I was soo excited to get the final book & start reading it.  However, I found my self having a hard time getting through the 1st chapter.  Now I am half way through the book & its been a good read.  Some places it drags a little but still good.  I am not sure about anyone else but I found the previous books more exciting to read.  Maybe it'll get better towards the end of the book.  We shall see folks!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Cant' wait for the 3rd one and more. Really good story and the dialog is very witty and believable. Highly recommended

B0083SBMBM|4.0|Didn't care for the movie of Thor or Iron Man 2, but I thought this one was very good.  Very well acted, good plot and story line and the effects were very good also.  Some clever moments.  Hulk grabbing Lokei's cape was classic.<br />Worth watching and one of the best in the super hero movies.  Very entertaining and well done.  I wlll buy this one and watch it again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a great and fun game but occasionally lags. please do something about it. it causes to hit something especially when it gets too fast and laggs longer.
B00ALCBTWU|2.0|There are a lot of very good war movies out there...but this is not one of them.  The acting is fine and the filming is good, but it is boring, a lot of unnecessary language etc. that did nothing to add to the movie at all.  Didn't enjoy this movie at all.  Another poor war movie that was a big disapointment was Fortress.  Too many great WW2 films out there to waste your time on this one.  Try When Trumpets Fade if you are looking for a good war flick that is not that well known, but very well done!
B000W8HC8I|4.0|This book delves into the life of the insanely rich, a reality 99% of us will never experience. Quite shocking and completely unrealistic at parts but fascinating at the same time.  I don't feel Jordan was completely egocentric like some of the other reviewers stated; in fact, I feel he makes fun of himself constantly and is remorseful for his wrongdoings. I want to read the next book and look forward to the movie.
B004SIP88Y|5.0|The directing and cinematography and absolutely spectacular.  This man is an artist in his directing.  The acting was very good, and the story was surprising in all it's twists.  Wow.  I didn't expect that but was pleasantly surprised.  Some things were rather fantastic and unrealistic but totally overshadowed by the beautiful filming.<br />I think this is Jet Li's best film that I have seen.  Nice to see Donnie Yen in this as well.  Very good movie.
0810970686|4.0|I purchased this book for my daughter. She enjoyed reading the first book. She liked this one as well, I honestly don't know which is her favorite. I think she likes them so much b/c she can relate to the characters.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I thought \\"Batman Begins\\" was outstanding.  I did not see the second one, but after watching \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\", was disapointed, in that the plot was shaky at best, and was boring to be honost.  My wife did not like it at all either.  I think it was poorly written, and weak.  This movie is not horrible.  It does have it's moments and I think Ann Hathaway's charector was good etc., but the main drawback to this movie, was that it was endless!  The plot and story wouldn't have struck me as weak if it wasn't dragged out so much.  there should have been more deleted scenes and it would've been much more enjoyable.  Some good scenes, but because of that, were far between.<br />  Not the worst, but if you haven't seen it, don't get your hopes up too much.  rent an alternative just in case.

B0006B2A42|2.0|The submarine movie has been a fine genre for many years, prime territory for white-knuckle tension as men battle formidable elements. From [[ASIN:0792841670 Run Silent, Run Deep]] to the terrific [[ASIN:B000IDADAG The Hunt for Red October]], rarely does such claustrophobic atmosphere disappoint. The 1968 film \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" barely has a sweaty brow and, considering the subject matter, its lack of suspense is a rather incredible accomplishment. Based on Alistair MacLean's novel [[ASIN:1402790333 Ice Station Zebra]], compare this work to other MacLean-inspired films [[ASIN:B000E1ZKJQ The Guns of Navarone [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B0037LQ3AU Where Eagles Dare]] for an idea as to how much potential is wasted.<br /><br />Partially based on a true story, a Russian spy satellite crash lands in the Arctic and the race is on to retrieve its valuable information. The U.S. sends a crack nuclear submarine team into the wild, led by Captain Rock Hudson. He's forced to take on a trio of mysterious passengers including a cynical British spy (Patrick McGoohan), a sympathetic Russian (Ernest Borgnine) and a hard-nosed Marine (Jim Brown). They must travel beneath the ice and break through near the target. En route, someone is attempting to sabotage the mission. This sounds exciting, but it lumbers with the speed of a glacier.<br /><br />John Sturges, nearing the end of a spectacular career ([[ASIN:B000IZZS5O The Great Escape]]), directed what could very well be his worst film. At best with outdoor heroics, he appears trapped like, well, a man in a submarine. When the crew breaks through the ice and dons parkas to hike to the satellite's wintery perch, it's apparent the Arctic landscape is filmed entirely on a set. Compare these unconvincing scenes to Howard Hawks' 1951 classic [[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]]. That film also took place within the drifts of the deadly Arctic, but Hawks had the creative sense to film exteriors in Montana and interiors in a large industrial refrigerator. Quite simply, Kenneth Tobey and crew were freezing, and you could see the breath in front of their faces. You'll get no such authenticity in \\"Ice Station Zebra,\\" where blocks of ice are as menacing as cardboard boxes.<br /><br />Hudson was also nearing the end of a successful movie career, where he would soon evolve into a television actor. \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" would be one of his last roles in a big-budget production. A likable comedic presence ([[ASIN:B00009IB1F Man's Favorite Sport?]]), he was fresh off his greatest performance in the dark 1966 classic [[ASIN:B00CUKTGEE Seconds (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]. This film does him no favors, where he's given little to do but pose. It's a shame. When forced, Rock could deliver the goods as he did so many years ago on the [[ASIN:B000WZUT18 Giant]] plains of Marfa, Texas. Brown is also given a one-note character and completely disappears into the scenery. McGoohan steals the film, chomping a cigarillo while bringing a dark intensity to his character the rest of the film lacks.<br /><br />Today, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is perhaps best known as being Howard Hughes' favorite film. A reclusive, obsessive-compulsive during his final years, he reportedly watched this over 100 times. What exactly did he see in this work? I don't have a clue, with the exception the story is gadget-heavy, paying uncomfortably long attention to the details of the nuclear submarine. Hughes was a great airplane designer and pilot before sickness overtook him. Perhaps the incessant submarine detail was of interest. Or maybe it was a cure for insomnia.

159463176X|3.0|I was very disappointed with this book because Mr. Hosseini is a very gifted writer, as he has proven with his first two works.  I loved Land of a Thousand Suns, it is is one of my all time favorites.  But not this one!  I'm almost finished with it and can see by the other reviews that I might not want to waste my time on it.  I started skimming reading about halfway through as I realized that he was going on and on about characters and events that had no real bearing on anything.  The book started out strong and then started fading about a third of the way through.  I will probably fast forward read to the end just to finish it, but there are far too many characters and just too much sadness and sickness and little joy in this novel for my liking.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am late getting started on Downton Abby, but this is such a wonderful show.  Wonderful to watch all 3 seasons at once. Can't wait for season 4.
1781162646|5.0|I have read everything Mr. King has written, this book for me was very sweet with the underpinings of the supernatural. I compare it to &#34;Bag of Bones&#34;, but I dont think the plotting and character development is as deeply explored in &#34;Joyland&#34;. I loved that it was told from the perspective of the young hero, now in the later years of his life. It has a lot of chills and thrills, but they are very subtle and fit the theme of the novel. As with all of his books, I began reading and could not put it down until I finished. I am a hugh fan, but gave the book to a friend who doesnt read this genre and she loved it. I would recommend it to any reader. It was a very enjoyable book.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|Knowing this was the last allowed the writers and actors to shift into overdrive as they headed for the finish line, and having Lois finally know Cark's secret was icing on the cake!  This is a season that should not be missed!  Hardly a clunker in the bunch!
125000098X|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.  What made it even better was that I paid a fraction of the price for a new book, received the book well before the indicated timeframe and in excellent condition.
B0036G1T78|5.0|I've watched this movie multiple times over the years, and I am always blown away at how tight and precise it was conceived and executed.  Redford did a fabulous job, and Dunaway was incredible.  The storyline was unique, and the characterization was believable.  Instead of a highly trained and skilled marksman for an operative that went around shooting up everyone in sight, we got a normal-Joe type CIA employee who was barely qualified with any weapon--other than his mind.  And that is exactly what made this so great!  Amazing movie.  I highly recommend it.

B00E1LR2B4|4.0|In \\"20 Feet From Stardom\\" (2013 release; 91 min.), director Morgan Neville brings a great look into the importance of the backup singers in rock and roll and R&B. There is an enjoyable mix of interviews of \\"big names\\" (the movie opens with insights from none other than Bruce Springsteen himself, later on Mick Jagger provides comments as well), along with archive footage, and then focusing on several famously un-famous backup singers both from the old days (Merry Clayton, Darlene Love, Tata Vega) and more recently (Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill). Did you know that one of those songers won a Grammy? If you wonder who, just watch! The best moment in the documentary comes when we see a discussion about the backup singers of Luther Vandross, only then to learn that Vandross himself started out as a back-up singer for David Bowie! Best of all, the documentary gives us archive footage of this (when Bowie went through his soul period on the \\"Young Americans\\" album). The person who comes out worst in this documentary is Phil \\"Wall of Sound\\" Spector. If you wonder why, just watch!<br /><br />The bigger question relating to those obviously talented singers is why did they not make it big while other less talented singers did? Stevie Wonder comments that \\"it's not a matter of talent, it's luck and circumstances\\" and Springsteen says the same but in different words. (Please note that there is a great soundtrack album, containing many of the songs featured in this movie, including Lou Reed's \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", Talking Heads' \\"Slippery People\\" (the live version from \\"Stop Making Sense\\"), David Bowie's \\"Young Americans\\", and several tracks from the 'backup' singers.)<br /><br />I saw this documentary at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati a couple of weekends ago (and the screening was very well attended, incidentally). So glad I did. \\"20 Feet From Stardom\\" brings a slice of life in the music business that we the fans know little about, and Neville has put together an entertaining documentary that also gives some bigger lessons in life. If you are a music buff, I'd say that is documentary is a can't miss, must-see. \\"20 Feet From Stardom\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ntertaining documentary that also gives some bigger lessons in life.

B003UESJJC|5.0|Not too long ago I finally gave in and purchased a Blu-ray player. So next I wanted to shop for some movies that have been important to me over the years, and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was certainly one of those. When in addition I noticed that this \\"deluxe\\" version was available here on Amazon for such a fan-friendly price, this was a no-brainer. So the set arrived a few weeks ago and I finally had time to digest most of this.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure\\" (3 Blue-ray DVDs) contains almost too much material! On DVD1 we get the original version of the movie, as well as the \\"Redux\\" version released first in the theaters in 2001 with about 50 min. of additional footage. I went to see \\"Redux\\" in the theatre, and now for the first time saw it again. It simply confirms that the original 1979 version remains the superior one, at least for me. In particular the French plantation scene is way too long and really kills the momentum in the Redux version. But it's nice to get the option to make that decision. That said, I don't know how many times I've seen Apocalypse Now over the years (I was 19 when it was released in 1979), and it still remains a towering achievement by Francis Ford Coppola. There are so many classic scenes in this movie! As to the bonus materials on DVD2, where to begin? For me the 1 hour conversation between Coppola and Martin Sheen (from 2010) is the most enjoyable item in here, for the sheer entertainment value as both these guys are telling one great story after another. The conversation between Coppola and Milius is pretty good too. After that, I was very pleased to get all the items pertaining to the music and soundtrack for the movie, with the heavy emphasis on the electronic/synthesizer elements. I had bought the original soundtrack (double album on vinyl) when it came out in 1979, and wore out the grooves over time! DVD3 contains the Hearts of Darkness documentary from 1991, and remains very enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />As to the Blu-ray version, I didn't notice all that much an improvement, to be honest. (I make this comment after just having seen a couple of other older movies where the Blu-ray upgrade was nothing short of stunning, namely Lawrence of Arabia and Yellow Submarine.) But it's not a complaint. This set is a delight from start to finish, and very happy to have this. If it wasn't clear by now, \\"Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ersion, I didn't notice all that much an improvement, to be honest.

B009M4KTEM|3.0|It's tough to give 3 stars to anything Jerry Garcia Band. If you are collecting all the live recordings you can get your hands on then by all means buy this. This is better music than 98% of music out there, and my review is not really for you.<br /><br />Rather, my review is meant for someone trying to decide between the different recordings for their 1st or 2nd Jerry Garcia Band purchase, which is more likely the people reading reviews on Amazon. If this is the case, than I strongly recommend  considering buying 'Let It Rock' first because Nicky Hopkins is just awesome on the piano on that recording. The band went through several different keyboard/piano players and this has a huge affect on the 'sound' of each recording.<br /><br />Once you have 'Let It Rock' I would strongly recommend the self-titled Jerry Garcia Band or the GarciaLive Volume 2. Both feature Melvin Seals on the organ/keyboards and the sound is just way more up my alley.<br /><br />I really found Ozzie Ahlers' 'spacey' synthesizer-heavy keyboard sound a big distraction on this record, and the same goes for the Kean College Record.<br /><br />Its easy to give 5 stars to every Jerry Garcia Band recording and be done with it, but I'm trying to help out someone trying to decide among them. One man's opinion. :)

B00DYEN5QU|5.0|A Superman movie that shows a well rounded character that is still a hero (if a green one). Serious without being forlorn (I'm looking at you Superman Returns), and seriously action packed. Placing such a huge Earth threatening event at the beginning of his career gave us a story that made the hero truly worth watching. While some may have felt that this caused too much destruction and loss of human life for a Superman movie, I would say that Superman himself is still presented as a hero we know. He is constantly fighting to save the world and  believes in the sanctity of life.<br /><br />*****************<br />Without spoiling too much, the \\"controversial\\" ending, actually shows more about why Superman does not kill than I have seen in any medium. Any human being would have no qualms about stopping a mass murderer to stop them from killing others, but for Superman this turns into an issue he wrestles with at his core, leading to begging a psychopath to not making him go any further and tears.<br />********************<br /><br />The implied body count may have been high in one city, but it creates a situation where one hero saves the whole world (First time we have seen that in a Superman movie yet). It also presents a threat so big that we actually worry about whether the hero can succeed, or even survive the onslaught. Most people complain that they don't like Superman because everything is too easy for him (at least in most movie portrayals). It was interesting to see a viable threat that makes him struggle without the crutch of Kryptonite.<br /><br />Its a 3D post-convert and while in the theater it wasn't the best 3D ever it was better than most post-converts. The Highlight 3D scene is definitely a back-story-exposition scene with Jor-El. It is done with Art-Deco statues and is a beautifully rendered 3D scene that hopefully the Blu Ray will be able replicate faithfully.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Kids loved it. Great story, it is one of those 80 innocent kid stories.  Acting is ok considering there are some famous cast in the movie
B009KS4XRO|3.0|4 things I found wrong: 1. It freezes all the time and it causes you have to force close all the time and causes you to lose credits. 2. The time need to be synced with the calling of the numbers because the time race down very quickly. 3. You should be able to convert your coins to bingo credits instead of paying out of pocket and 4. You shouldn't have to wait 24 hours for new credits other than that its ok.
0061950726|4.0|I liked the comparison between the past system of caring for our children as a society and the present.  Some things really haven't changed that much, human nature being what it is.  Loved the characters, they were so real and so many things I could identify with as an older woman, whose family were Dutch immigrants.  Good understanding of a girl's struggles with becoming a young and responsible adult after having spent her childhood &#34;in the system.&#34;  I loved the connection between the two main characters.

0385341008|4.0|A very interesting book. I can not put myself in the situation the characters in the book experienced at the time period in which it was written. The Arthur was able to bring some bright spots to life at a very depression time in  history. I wander how people living in that location would view this book.

Even though it was revealed what it was..I still couldn't understand it. Maybe the pain meds I am taking had something to do with it..but I think it was the movie. I would like to see what others thought of it.

He started kindergarten last year and I found something on Pinterest that had their teachers leave a message in the book from grade K-12 and at graduation you hand it to him.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|You know what it feels like when you find an author you love and insatiably read ALL their books and then you're finished and you feel lost, not knowing what, if anything, could fill the void?  Well that recently happened to me when I finished all of Tana French's novels. I needed a little rest from reading after being completely absorbed by them but pretty soon I wanted more BOOKS TO READ! Thank goodness for the kindle store,  technology, and auto-personalized recommendations. First i read Cuckoo's Calling and it was great! Perfect segue from Irish crime fiction to Neil Gaiman...but knowing that J.K. Rowling wrote it reminded me of how much i loved and devoured the Harry Potter books and I started to crave a little magic and fantasy. The Ocean at the End of the Lane very much hit the spot for that and I am so excited to read ALL OF HIS BOOKS now! This one also had a certain touch that reminded me of one of my all time favorite authors- Madeleine L'Engle.

B0058YPL66|4.0|Honestly, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about `Once Upon a Time'. I saw the teaser on tv and wasn't particularly impressed. Sounded like a stupid idea. But then a friend of mine convinced me to see at least the pilot of the series... and I was hooked.<br /><br />What I like the most about this series (at least this first season) is the way well known fairy tales had been rewritten so to come all together and create one larger story. Yes, there are some logic slips here and there, but on the whole, the story stays together nicely and every character add something to the larger picture.<br />I also enjoyed the way the story was structure, basically starting from the ending and going backwards. That was probably the cleverest idea, in my opinion, because that was what kept me returning to this series and wanting to see more. I knew most of the fairy tales used in here, and I was eager to see how they had been used. And what's more, every piece falls in its plaice but not in a chronological manner. Pieces of stories are provided at random, so that the viewer has to figure out where in the chronology every piece of information goes. It requires participation from the viewer and I enjoyed this a lot.<br /><br />The main characters are mostly fine. What I heard said from other fans of the show is true for me too: my favourite characters are the bad guys, Regina and Gold. The two actors are very good in the part, and their characters provide for maybe the best new take of the story. But I liked Snow White as well. Her character is far from the damsel in distress of the fairy tale. She's a strong-willed woman and I like the way her story had been intertwined with Regina's so that the hate between them is believable and never rests on stupid misunderstandings. It's the course of life that put them one against the other in spite of their best intents.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the story in the fairy tales' world is far more interesting than the one in the `real' world, so that characters in the real world tended to be less interesting. This is particularly true for the two that should be more important: Emma and Henry.<br />Henry seems to be there only as an excuse. It is never clear why he believed in the book he was given and how he came to the conclusion that the stories in the book are real fairy tales and they're connected to the place he lives in and the people around him. That's a very weak part of the plot, in my opinion. Emma... you never know what's she's thinking. I was never sure whether she believed Henry or not, and if she didn't, why she acted like she did. Maybe if the stories in the fairy tales' world and the stories in the real world had been more connected (I mean, more than just by the characters), the characters' motivations would have been stronger. Maybe.<br />But all in all the show was so enjoyable that I'm more than willing to forgive weaknesses and non-logic things that are in there.<br /><br />Reccomended.al' world, so that characters in the real world tended to be less interesting.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is an excellent writer who creates wonderful, fully fleshed characters and situations that show daily life in Afghanistan from various perspectives. This book reads much like a soap opera or segments of a TV weekly drama. I would prefer a more solidified plot in which the foreshadowing and symbolisim are woven into a clear climax and denouement,rather than falling limpless into unknowing minds and the sad progression of trickling time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My 14 year old daughter read this trilogy and LOVED it. She begged me for weeks to read it and assured me that it would be worth my time (as I don't have much of that lying around, I tend to cherish it). She was absolutely correct. There was a section of one of the books that dragged a bit, but it picked back up soon enough. The overall story was so captivating that the part that dragged did not deter me from finding out how this epic battle of good versus evil and the discovery of love would end. I wanted to clap my hands and cheer at the end, but I couldn't because I had to wipe away the tears from my eyes....sigh...
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Ok says I must put 20 or more words in the review I think the required title covers it. I will not be wasting my or any one else's time again. No more reviews from me
B0091WNK8M|5.0|When I came home and yelled, &#34;Hey you GUUUUYS!&#34;, I was greeted with smiles and hugs but no recognition of the reference. I knew I had to share this movie with my 4 kids. From age 7 to 14 with a mix of boys and girls, everyone loved it, just as I expected. Now we all giggle when someone yells, &#34;Hey you GUUUUYS!&#34;
034580404X|5.0|A wonderful trilogy to read. Some surprising topics but keeps the reader very engaged. Breathtaking! Invigorating! Perfect books to read if you are looking to spice up your intimate relationships :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Great and very quick read. A very sweet, thoughtful reflection on love and loss and adolescence and real life and meaning for (not of) life.
0920668372|5.0|This story made me cry (in a good way). Such an adorable and true story. Kids grow up so fast. One of my favorite bedtime stories to read to my child.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is basically like Temple Run, but just way more fun and it has cute little minions instead of a tarzan dude running. So I guess in a nutshell, this is one of the funnest games I have ever played!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Freely works great. I use it to replace google reader, and like it much more. I wish I had switched long ago.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game and I thought is was all about horses but you can buy a unicorn and I love unicorns!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie has style and substance.  Both of which are missing in many movies this days.  Make sure you check this flick out but be ready for some blood!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played this game for hours trying to figure it out! This is probably one of my favorite apps of all time!! The fact that you are trapped and looking for clues makes it suspenseful which makes it even more fun for all ages!!! I highly recommend this app! :)
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Will be great once that issue is fixed!! Can't wait to get started on a great farm game!!<br />Graphics look great too
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have bought all the modern plainswalker games, i even own the old one. I use to be a pretty serious mtg player when i was a kid but i have not touched a card in ten years. I very much like the touch interface and its as least as good of a game as last years that i own on my xbox and pc
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Excellent in atmosphere, good script and production values. One point though: the first half of the film is more thought and drama, where as the second half is pretty much an action flick.<br /><br />How successfully the halves are joined is pretty much the individual viewer's call.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app just something to do if you have time to kill but u don't have to have Wi-Fi which is fantastic.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|no information on how to play l would have like to play but did not know how.very disappointed that I couldn't
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app over any of the others I have installed. I have family and friends across the country and I can check on the weather in  their area in case of a trip to see them or just checking on them. I use this daily.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the only thing I'd like is if they would add skins and update as fast as the Apple store updates there  version
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horse and cant own one. So its nice to pretend sometimes lol.  Really  cool and i love the racing games and fun tasks. Great app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game the kids love it.  It has a wide variety of screens so it s never the same as you 're playing along. The graphics are excellent for what I paid (nothing) kind of makes up for the poke ball we bought that was so lame.  Great job to the creators of this one.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|It was ok. Not mind blowing. Good beach read. Definitely a cheesy mystery involving an over-the-top, smartest and strongest man in the world protagonist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game because I like running games and it is very enjoyable like temple run 2 and other games
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've been looking for all of the movies in BluRay and haven't been able to find them in the stores - even in standard format.  So, finding a boxed set was great!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|love the watch for the price. a little difficult to set day and date but great overall every day watch.
B001A5HBJC|3.0|I've just finished watching Season 1 and I'm still scratching my head to discover what everyone finds so fascinating. There are alot of good qualities to the show - the acting is above average, the setting and costumes. I find one or 2 of the characters interesting in an odd way (Draper and Campbell) but for the most part the characters are pretty stereotypical of what I would have expected to find in the 60s era soap opera. T I will admit episode 12 with all the masturbatory references was a hoot. I was getting interested in the subplot with Don's mysterious past but they've already put that to bed. Maybe it'll come back but the mystery is gone.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping to be hooked like everyone else. But overall, I find there to be too little action and a repetition of the same plot points from episode to episode.
0670014893|5.0|I had the pleasure of listening to the audio book, read by...John LeCarre!!<br /><br />What a wonderful experience; I recommend it.<br /><br />Mr LeCarre seems fed up with the modern world and is telling us all to throw in the towel.  All the noble characters in the book are beaten down silly: \\"Paul\\", Jeb and then Toby.  Everyone done in by the evil business man/deal maker, Jay Crispen. LeCarre calls him simply \\"uneducated\\".  He sees no hope for the individual to do anything against the almighty business organization.  In the end everyone has a second job, working as a freelance artist for a multi-national security firm.  They are all in on it and all on the take.<br /><br />The beating Toby takes at the end with a burlap bag over his head to prevent any facial disfigurement is very powerful writing.<br /><br />If you get a chance to listen to Mr LeCarre read his own work, give it a go.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Despite the setting, this is not a laid-back movie.  They may be in a nursing home, but these residents do not plan on sitting around playing cards or watching the telly; they were all actors and this is just another role that they are performing.  The location is a beautiful estate that is filled with acres of parks and gardens.  The season is autumn so we get to see the English countryside during this beautiful time of year.  Add to this a cast (see below) that is terrific and a story with great dialogue and you have an entertaining movie.<br /><br />Maggie Smith, Godsford Park, Downton Abbey and many others<br />Billy Connolly, Mrs. Brown<br />Pauline Collins,  You Meet a Tall, Dark Stranger<br />Michael Gambon, The King's Speech<br />Tom Courtney, Nichols Nikleby<br /><br />3.50 STARS: *Receiving this DVD through Amazon's Vine Program did not influence my rating or review of this book; all opinions are mine*.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I have all the other Die Hards.  So I had to add this to my collection.  I love Bruce Willis.  Action packed
0425263924|4.0|I have enjoyed all three of Mz. Day's books.  They are (in my opinion) better than the Shades of Gray books.  These had interesting characters with underlying problems that readers could find believable.  Yes, the sex was there but I think overall I had more sympathy with these characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was VERY EXPLICIT IN ITS IMAGINATION AND Very descriptive. Lookin forward to the next one !!!!<br />THANK YOU
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was so scared to read this book, afraid that it would rip my heart out. Which it did kinda, but that's to be expected situation like this. The characters just in this book are so easy to fall in love with. I love their humor and how they talk to each other. I love how it's a cancer story but also a love story. I just loved it period. &lt;3
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Another cute, challenging brain teaser from Zepto without annoying advertising and constantly trying to sell add ons. This is how game apps should be!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a really fun game. And it was fun trying to figure out the items needed to go to the next level. I would highly recommend playing this game!
1451695195|5.0|This was an awesome book. I totally believe in what Eben Alexander wrote. I have shared this book with others who felt the same way.
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|This app freezes and stalls my kindle out every single time. so i stopped using it and just went back to using my laptop for email.
B000I9S6AE|5.0|this is the BEST spike lee movie, in my opinion. If you like good music, a good story, and unpredictability this is your movie!<br />It features an all-star cast, that spike lee has directed into perfection ..........Great movie!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|this is an awesome album, i've listened to the whole thing many times and i really liked it a lot and it's definitely a great tool for practicing rhythm with, especially track 7 called Save The Day. that one has a really awesome rhythm to it. and so does Come & Get It. this, to me, is a 10 star album.
0763644765|5.0|we love all of leslie's cute board books, and this one, too. it's cute! funny! and easy-to-understand, which is helpful for our little man.
B005CMSDKA|2.0|I ordered this wanting to use the digital copy and right on the front of the blu -ray it stated the expiration date of the digital copy which has expired.  I returned it and they sent me another copy which was also expired. I believe they are all expired but they should not list them advertising an expired feature. Not sure they will fix it. If it were just listed as a blu ray I would have kept it and given it five stars. It only gets two though because they assured me I would get a copy with a good date on it.
0345529057|5.0|Amazing series, pretty much impossible to put down.  Bought this set and i thought it would last me a while but i ended up cruising through all of them in a few months.  If you are a fan of any any other medieval literature then this is definitely for you.
0985557834|5.0|First of all I must say that I've been a fan of JD's work for a while now. The way he teaches while inspiring at the same time is truly uncanny.<br /><br />Another major point I want to make - this particular author provides far more info and varieties of weaves and projects in his books than anyone else out there. Other books show you the Solomon weave done ten different times but with different blandly colored cord, or cord endings, then maybe they put in two other weaves and replicate those in different colors to fill out the book as if they've presented the reader with ANY inspiring ideas.<br /><br />- This is for the serious paracordist-<br />This book is the second volume of THE quintessential guide for the paracordist who never wants to stop learning. This book is full of projects that will keep even the most veteran paracordist busy for weeks. Every single tie or weave has been separated into chapters with certain minute or even drastic variations included.<br /><br />Like volume one, number two does it justice and then some. As in the first book, The colors used for each tie seem to have been carefully selected to really make the weave one that will stand out to the reader.  The author has expanded his scope, so to speak, and includes several sections on more practical uses for Paracord tying - like making a pouch, belt holster, machete grip, and a sling, just to name a few. Some others are snow goggles, and beach sandals - if you can believe that!<br /><br />I was pleased beyond belief to have gotten the book yesterday (2 weeks before the scheduled release), mainly because like his other books, they inspire the reader to take his lessons, and run with them to wherever their own creativity and imagination can take them!<br /><br />I owe probably 90% of my knowledge of Paracord fusion ties directly to the author of this book - J.D. LENZEN<br />I would like to personally thank him for releasing another wonderfully crafted book, that (somehow) has topped the first, and also for his YouTube channel TIAT.<br /><br />If you're unsure of which book to get on what can be done with Paracord, then look no further - BUY THIS BOOK.<br />I also strongly suggest Volume 1 if you don't already have it. Volume 1 works better for beginner, and intermediate paracordists, as it begins with some of the more simple and basic Paracord ties, knots, and designs at the start of the book, then chapter by chapter, the weaves get progressively more complex. Each one has its own challenges, just as with this book.<br /><br />- ON AN UPDATED NOTE, I'VE ALREADY DONE SEVERAL TIES IN THIS BOOK IN THE 24 HOURS SINCE I GOT IT, AND THEY LOOK SIMPLY AMAZING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU CHANGE UP THE COLORS. I WILL UPDATE WITH PHOTOS TO GIVE VIEWERS A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT I MEAN-<br /><br />Excellent job again J.D.,<br />  Tony H.
B000071WET|5.0|I bought this album because I'm a big fan of Elton John's. He is a very talented singer I grew up listening to his music if your looking for a great album to add to your collection this is the album
B005C9YZIW|5.0|We bought this six disc Blu-ray of Planet Earth since we enjoy watching the wonders of the world.<br />These Blu-rays did not disappoint, we enjoyed every minute.<br />The picture & sound quality are spectacular.
B000002J5K|5.0|This is a great sound track if you loved the movie you will love the soundtrack. This album has many great song by many great singers
034537410X|5.0|Just got the book and want to let you know the  envelope was not sealed properly but the book seems to be fine.  I'll let you know if anything happens with it.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Enjoyed this book.  Totally different style and rhythm; very refreshing.  Would recommend it to someone wanting a different type of read.<br />Jls
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I ordered The Woman in Black for my daughter. She was very happy. It was in excellent condition and came very quickly. Thank you.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is the best thing in the whole world.  It is the best game in the universe.  My favorite part is rescuing the animals.
1932735410|5.0|I had been studing this book for a couple months when I learned that the PMBOK was changing editions July 31, 2013. Some major concepts change. Still using it for definitions.<br />The book is well written and the Tricks of the Trade are very helpful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon's masterpiece--still his best work and my family's favorite show ever.<br />Humor, drama, well written. The cast of then-nearly unknowns was brilliant.<br />The sci-fi series for people who really don't care much for sci-fi.<br /><br />The series was prematurely killed by incompetent suits at the network, and by the time they realized their folly, it was too late. The followup movie, Serenity, was good, but these are great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i cant stop playing this game its on my kindle fire and iphone4s its awesome i give it 5 stars
B000OV85AW|5.0|Settle yourself down for a long evening with a bowl of popcorn. \\"Papillon\\" is a story about a complicated life, and Steve McQueen is magnificent as Charriere the only person who ever escaped the French prison of Devil's Island.<br />The movie/story is long and tedious. It demands your attention. Put the kids to bed.<br />Watch McQueen in the prison scenes -- what he did was real acting! A lot of the movie happens in prison<br />so, prepare yourself for some emotional scenes.<br />But then he finally escapes -- and there are even more adventures to come.<br />Enjoy!<br />Supporting actors, Dustin Hoffman for one, are also wonderful.<br />Watch it again. You will be amazed at what you missed.<br />Mytwocents
B005J2UM9S|1.0|I spent the whole movie waiting for it to get scary. Was completely let down. The camera work was great but that was really about it. The movie was a let down once the supposed \\"lock in\\" began. It's not even worth the free rental.
B004HX0P2Y|1.0|They trick you into buying the digital copy when thats not what I searched for!! Watch out and make sure what you are buying.
B003XDVUNW|4.0|Daughter had youth size 1 in these shoes.  Wore them everywhere!!! School, beach, swimming in ocean.  They held up great for two yrs.  She outgrew them and I am so happy I found them in bigger sizes.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini's character development is outstanding in this book!  I thought this book was great....however everyone had told me it was better than his other two and I would have to disagree.  I thought at times the characters and stories felt disconnected.  While I became emotionally invested in each character's story along the way...it was hard to see how everything connected until the very end.  Overall highly recommended!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|A crazy drive of ups and downs through Nikki's life! I can't imagine half of the experiences he has lived through and has turned out a wonderful, compassionate, and caring human being! I would give anything to meet him in person! At least I can listen to him talk often on his killer radio station Sixx Sense on XM242!!!
B00D28TNT6|5.0|When Bristol duo F... Buttons came along in 2008 with debut album \\"Street Horrrsing\\" and 2009's follow up \\"Tarot Sport\\" they gave Electronic music a much needed kick up the back side, they didn't sound like any other band at the time and not only was \\"Tarot Sport\\" one of that year's best albums it was also one of the Decades best. It's now been four years since that album and of course in between their music was famously used in the 2012 Olympic Games, with \\"Surf Solar\\" and the epic \\"Olympians\\" both been used. Any chance of the duo deciding to cash in on Olympic success is completely debunked by listening to their new album \\"Slow Focus\\", an album that shows they still make electronic music like no one else.<br /><br />Beginning with the tribal drum beats of album opener \\"Brainfreeze\\" before the duos now familiar electronic noise sound creeps in sets this album up nicely, any thought that the band would shorten their songs are completely debunked, not for them 3 minutes short snippets of electronic sounds as what you mainly get are between 4 and 11 minute pieces of music that are like epic journeys taking the listener on a ride you won't forget like the final two tracks on the album the haunting \\"Stalker\\" and \\"Hidden XS\\". Then there is the brilliant and eerie \\"Sentients\\" which brings visions of a 1970's Michael Myers walking down an American neighborhood after a group of teenage kids.<br /><br />F... Buttons have now released three fine albums in a row and are proof that there is still plenty of room for experimenting in Electronic music. In a year that has already seen some great releases \\"Slow Focus\\" is right up there with the best of them
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just an all around fun game! Keeps you guessing and it`s full of surprises! Like the reviewers before me said it is much more fun if you only use the clues when you are stumped!
B0055SWM08|3.0|great way to pass the time when I am bored and waiting on the doc to come in. not to hard
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|There are basically two responses that I have when I hear a great song for the first time. Either I want to hear the next song, or I want to turn off the radio and process what I've just heard. Guy Clark's music almost always elicits the latter response. His songs demonstrate a grasp of human life far deeper than I could express. Simply put, he knows what he writes about, and he doesn't write bad songs. If you were to ask me every day for a month what my favorite Guy Clark song was, I might well give 31 different answers. He's that good.<br /><br />But while I was waiting for the album to be released, I was concerned that it wouldn't hold up with his previous work. Needlessly. \\"My Favorite Picture of You,\\" \\"Heroes,\\" \\"Rain in Durango,\\" and \\"The High Price of Inspiration\\" all stood out on my first listen as worth the price of the entire album. And seven other songs more than carry the weight of expectation.<br /><br />I pity the person who is asked to assemble a \\"best-of\\" collection. There's no point. Just release a boxed set with everything on there. He's that good, and this album is a worthwhile addition to his discography.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good and worth the read! Very sad but very good. I Couldn't put it down and loved every page.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I found this show through a friend and from the first episode I was hooked.  Can't wait for season 3.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I bought it in kindle version. I am a student developing strong interests in behavioral economics and a big fan for Daniel Kahneman. I read lots of his paper and when I found this book, I thought I would never miss it. It's somehow like Professor Daniel's personal academic biography. But it contains lots of interesting experiments which express cutting-edge research ideas,methods and discoveries in behavioral economics and social science areas. Although I did not finish reading it, I would definitely recommend this book to people who loves economics and psychology, especially behavioral and experimental economics. And I think researches in this area would help people figure out how to make smarter choices and make this life more convenient.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Captures many of the timeless memories of the era and those magical days and nights of Woodstock. I recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that minion rush is fun because it has it's own story and all minions are the game.<br />It is super cool
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|One of the best music productions I've heard in a long time, this CD has it all, amazing musicianship, perfectly compose song's and a great soulful feel on every song.<br />WOW!! Can't wait to see the dogs live
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My little girl loves, loves this game. I had to buy the full version for her. She will play it for hours. She loves to squish the bugs when they show up. I think every little gardner(sp) will love this.
B001D09OAI|5.0|What better way to spend the day than watching baseball and having a good laugh, that's what happens with Major League. This is one you will enjoy over and over.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I couldn't think of a good title but this book is an easy read, is interesting and thought-provoking. While I'm not sure I agree with everything 100 percent, many of the things she says make sense. I'm especially interested in her comments about \\"allowing\\" and \\"being\\"since this is a common theme that's run through my head and heart since I was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer 3years ago. In addition I've felt God telling me to relax and trust him along with maintaining an attitude of gratitude. When I do this the fear and other forms of negativity evaporate. My lung tumor nearly disappeared after my earliest treatments and hasn't progressed in3 years. My oncologist has been pretty amazed at this. Anyway the reason I mention any of my personal experience is that I see some similarities in what I'm learning on my journey and what this book relates. I'm now seeking to clarify how I can learn better to \\"let go\\" of any fear I still have and progress in my ability to just \\"be\\". I think reading this book another time or two may help me gain insights in this process as I continue my journey.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|find the objects needed to get the key to go to the next floor. very interactive find this to open the box or cabinet to get a tool as you go along you can figure out what its needed for

B00006690G|5.0|I've been a fan of Eminem since he was doing D12 band & his underground Stuff in Detroit.When he became a household rapper with the song my name is I was floored even more & I have almost ALL his cd's.Now I'm going to have to put them on iPod touch 16gb 4th generation which will be interesting to do because I'm from the old skool(78 records/45 records/8 tracks/cassettes/radio/CD's now iPod :-) I'm wondering what will be next?But Eminem is electric for sure & I hope he continues to fourish in this everchanging business of Music.Keep UP the good work Eminem my family loves your body of work :-) -D.M.

B004PYD77K|1.0|While I see NOW in the product description that this DVD wont play in the USA, when I made my purchase I did not see any claim and I certainly would have not purchased two of these (gifts for others) had I known that.  We were able to get it to play on my laptop, but my son is out of luck.  Definite buyers remorse.  I see others are disappointed as well.  Great movie though.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is simply the best. At first I thought it was just boss battles but really you could swing webs and climb walls to almost anywhere. This game is so good the price is fair.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend showed this to me and i loved it but why does it have to be $6.99. But its worth the money its way better on xbox and your computer. So i would recommend this game for any minecraft person like me out their.<br /><br />Pros- Fast, You can save games, Runs perfect on your Kindle Fire HD<br /><br />Cons- Their are no reasons<br /><br />So get this appbits worth the $6.99
B005OZE9SA|3.0|Its a okay product, as stated. If it broke would i Buy It again? No. Much better products out here. WOuld call this interface a stepping stone for the Beginner in Music. You can produce great music with it overall. If you know what your doing that is.<br /><br />Side Note. Does not work with Protools 8 or earlier.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I had gotten this game for my young son to play and as with all games I get for him I preview it first. To my surprise it was a really fun game. The graphics were really good. We both enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and the best part is it ends with a bang I recommend for everyone everyone that likes drama

B007ME5BUG|5.0|Great telling of a pivotal period in world history - I would recommend everyone to read this, as what happened then has set the stage for what happens today and tomorrow.....
B0006Z2KIY|4.0|Good for a group.  Has a great plot and is also an excellent book.<br /><br />Best parts were the relationship between the main characters Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson<br /><br />Worst parts were the sexual scenes.<br /><br />Recommend to a group and give them the option to leave during the sexual scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this movie so I was really happy to find this game. It is fun to play and you get to enjoy the craziness of the minions in the game.
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I bought this little guy strictly to replace the laptop I had sitting under my wall-mounted TV. The laptop's job was to stream movies to it from our 'closet PC' that has all our digital movies on it. I realize that there is an i3 version of this box, but was looking to spend as little as possible for a super-slick package -- so I went with the Celeron.<br /><br />My initial tests were performed with some Simpsons episodes that are probably less than 480p in quality. Those were definitely not a problem for this little guy. I moved on to some fairly high bitrate 720p videos. No issues. Then the master test of 1080p. Also... no problems. The video I played was ~10gb in size. No stuttering at all through XBMC.<br /><br />This thing was a beast to get to show up on my TV. In the beginning, it would show the loading screen of Windows 8 (also a success story on this little guy) and when it came time to login, there was nothing there. Very frustrating. I ended up plugging it into a monitor with HDMI at the same time as the TV (it showed up on the monitor) -- and in the settings on the monitor, told it to output only to the TV (done in Intel display properties). This showed a picture on the TV. I unplugged the monitor, restarted, and then the display was on the TV. Probably my TV's fault for being stupid. Who knows.<br /><br />Inaudible. Which is nice. Also, it does get warm, but the heat is dissipated through the case enclosure. In sleep mode, this thing is ICE cold, with a power consumption of nearly nothing (I have a kill-a-watt device for measuring). Was really excited to see that the power consumption on this is very little. I'm sure it would go down even further if a Haswell chip was put inside of one of these NUC units.<br /><br />Because of the mSata drive you have to drop inside, this thing is very fast.<br /><br />Please feel free to ask any questions you may have. I love this unit, and it is so SMALL! (4\\" x 4\\" x 2\\")<br /><br />--<br />EDIT/UPDATE:<br />Since it was frequently requested in the comments, I have supplied some simplistic facts regarding the Wattage used during activity (measured from a Kill-A-Watt appliance):<br /><br />OFF: 1.1W<br />IDLE: ~14W<br />720P VIDEO: ~17W<br />1080P VIDEO: ~18W<br /><br />It's tiny! For the state I live in (Idaho) and the cost of electricity, the Kill-A-Watt says it costs (during IDLE) about $0.98 per month to keep on, and if I had it on for 24/7 for 365 days of the year, it would run about $12.<br /><br />ALSO: The kit supplies you with the body, the motherboard, and the processor (and half a power cord; the 'brick'). The items you'll have to get second are: RAM (there are two slots), mSATA Solid State Drive, a \\"mickey mouse\\" power cord (like those found on half a laptop cable) and a way to get wireless internet if you don't want it wired. The suggested wireless cards on their website for this unit were fairly cheap (also suggested below the product in the \\"other customers bought\\" section).<br /><br />Hope this helps!s frequently requested in the comments, I have supplied some simplistic facts regarding the Wattage used during activity (measured from a Kill-A-Watt appliance):<br /><br />OFF: 1.1W<br />IDLE: ~14W<br />720P VIDEO: ~17W<br />1080P VIDEO: ~18W<br /><br />It's tiny!

B00APUQJLO|4.0|COSMOPOLIS has generated some extreme reaction since its release in mid- 2012. Some reviewers have loved it; others loathed it for its basic plotlessness, its static action and lengthy passages of dialogue. Basically a reflection on living in a capitalist society, the film centers on Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) living through a single day and moving from a position of security to one of relative instability. During that time he encounters a variety of characters, including some of his fellow-speculators, a barber who knew his father, and a deus ex machina figure forcing him to reflect on the consequences of living in a money-obsessed world. The film has a morality-play feel about it, with Packer as the representative of humankind enduring a series of encounters that expose some of the unwelcome aspects of life to him. Stylistically the film is quite repetitive; most of the action takes place in claustrophobic interiors, and the basic shot/reverse shot structure is employed during most of the conversational exchanges. This is deliberate on director David Cronenberg's part, as he tries to find an appropriate style to portray a world dedicated to repetitive ritual in which such things as emotion, spontaneity and chance had been squeezed out. COSMOPOLIS makes considerable demands on its viewers, but is definitely worth the effort.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was up to par with what I was expecting out of a last book in a series like this. But it had it's faults. And the professional narrator kinda sucked. Made Katniss sound way to old.  And even made her sound like she  had an even gloomier disposition than regular ole Katniss
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I do enjoy this game, but the energy thing is kind of annoying. There should also be a way to earn dollars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was great! I cant wait for more levels! It was difficult but not too hard. Great puzzle for all ages to enjoy!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|If you are a fan of How I Met Your Mother, this is for you. I keep going back to it...
145210655X|5.0|The kids loved it, their dad loved it, and I (mom) loved it for them all. Funny/cute book for anyone who loves Star Wars and thinks Darth Vader was just misunderstood!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|It is really hard to say that I hate this because it came brand new. I love the Big Bang Theory and I always wait until they have been out for a while that way the price comes down and I am not forfeiting quality either. Thanks!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like the fast paced style.  Love the character an  his rough an  ready don't give rats ass attitude. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This was the season that I got addicted to the Big Bang Theory in the first place. I do wait for a while to get the seasons versus buying the right away because they go down in price. But this season is really heartfelt and a must buy
B00B1ME3DQ|2.0|Maybe I bought the wrong album,or maybe eddie trunk is a schill for clutch,It was a terrible album for sure
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I love how this is in chronological order. And so far it seems to be outstanding. There might be much to interpretation, but you kind of get the drift.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this game is a minion temple run but there's a glitches and when you try to fight vector it stops good thing it is free
143911000X|3.0|I bought this a gift for someone else for a joke. But I have never heard anything back on how the person like it.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|my six year old loves this game (admittedly most her others are centered around education) but I think this game is ridiculous. the character does not even get to bake anything (like easy bake oven game ) and just goes around pushing buttons to fulfill order without taking to long. I would never pay money for this game but since it was free and my daughter likes it I'll give it three stars. My biggest issue is you don't get to do anything. you just click on stuff.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Great cd. This is a great band. Top notch musicianship (well not DreamTheater level but pretty good) and catchy sing along tunes that make you laugh your ass off ass well ass rock your a$$ off. Fat Girl and Turn Off The Lights are soon to be classics.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|I have been complaining about wanting to see some original stories and not so many re-makes and my voice was heard. I have to say that beware what you ask for! This is a morbid story to say the least, but it is one of the best productions that i have seen in quite a while.<br /><br /> The story is about human survival against all odds and rewards (Whishaw) Jean Baptiste Grenouille (student perfumer) with an increadable gift of olfactory excellence/precision that is extremely rare. His gift comes with a price tag attached that will come back to haunt him late in the movie. J B could not of had a harder life since his birth and life in an orphanage where he is treated as an oddity to be feared. He is sold for a small fee to a tannery owner when he was not worth keeping and his space was needed for a younger child.<br /><br />His life wasn't any better at the tannery and he had only a five year life expectancy of hard labor. He finds his chance to pursue his quest to smell everything in the world and to preserve the scents for eternity when he delivers goat skins to a washed out perfumer (Baldini) played by Dustin Hoffman. Baldini is in need to copy the latest perfume that a rival is cashing in on, but his nose is failing him and he can't figure out all the ingredients needed to reproduce the fragrance. JB seizes this opportunity and makes a deal with Baldini and tells him he not only can copy it, but he will make it better in trade for Baldini teaching him the in's and out's and how to preserve the fragrances. Baldini buys JB from the tannery owner and they begin their student/teacher relationship with a few minor problems and this tutelage/job is the first time in JB's life that he is more or less happy. They share everything and JB makes Baldini a very happy and a even more prosperous man, but JB wants to learn more because he has a desire to capture this one fragrance that consumes every fiber of his being.<br /><br />He leaves Paris for the town where Baldini learnd how to be a master perfumer to hone his skills and to fulfill his deepest desire/quest to capture and preserve this ultimate fragrance. His life takes a few steps backwards at his new employer akin to the tannery, but not as bad and his gift allows him some freedom to pursue and master his techniques for extracting his essential oils.<br /><br />I have left out certain key elements to the story so I wouldn't spoil everything. I just wanted to give you a basic understanding of his life and his story. The last twenty or so minutes are pretty crazy and more than a little over the top and at this time he learns about an even more precious gift the gift of ??? .<br /><br /> The acting, story/plot, direction, editing and cinematography are all top shelf and combined tell this provcative story in an unforgetable thought provoking way that I think will stay with me foe awhile. Is this a perfect story/movie?  No it isn't for many albeit small reasons like the accents of the French cast members using distinctive English accents or Hoffmans lame Italian accent and a few other minor oddities. The two deaths related to JB's harsh life and the scene near the end,  but they don't take much of anything away from the movie. 4+ stars<br /><br />Rating 0 to 5<br /><br />Story = 4+<br />Direction = 4+<br />Acting = 4+<br />Fear Factor = 2<br />Morbid Factor = 4<br />Gore = 1.4<br />Foul language = 1<br />Sex/Nudity = No/ Yes 5+<br />Entertainment Value =4+<br />Recomend = Yes 5+
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Its ok. Im not loving it but its far from their worst which may of been Risk. Some killer guitar playing and typical Megadeth stuff. Maybe better off borrowing this cd and burning yourself a copy than spending the cash.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|cannot get candy crush on kindle...so levels etc mean nothing to me....unless there is a way of getting the game...thanks
B003HN7BYA|5.0|The major label debut but technically 3rd 4th or 5th cd im not sure. Great cd though with some cool bonus material buy it you'll like it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game, it needs more levels. Makes you think outside the box! Give it a try,I think you'll like it too!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a good game if you want to play for months. You can breed, feed, and evolve your dragon. As far as price goes, you choose, there are plenty of coins to be made  for free but gold is hard to get unless you buy it.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|With the many remote desktop applications on the market that essentially do the same thing I found the splashtop to be to most user friendly. The app is well designed and less costly than other applications while being able to accomplish the same tasks. The design and simplistic layout has made it my favorite among the remote desktop clients and the one that most resembles the remote desktop offered with windows
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and can be challenging. Love the minions. It doesn't register the right moves sometimes but it doesn't happen that often.
0671449028|5.0|This is the first book we read to our child when starting the bedtime routine at about 4-5 months until now in toddler years.  It is easy to read, and anything that helps kids understand that jamies and teeth brushing are part of the bedtime routine has my vote.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A very well organised and clearly explained set of instructions for setting up a Kindle book. A must read for anyone new to creating Kindle books. It'll save you a lot of heartache with formatting and help your book look its best across a range of devices.
0679882820|5.0|As long as you don't mind acting a little silly when reading this book, kids will love it.  It has lots of animal and object noises and is quite fun.
B001974DG0|5.0|Einstein is my hero! Read the book and find out why. From beginning to the end I was literally pulled into the story.
0694003611|5.0|This book was popular when I was growing up and so we purchased it for my child.  It is one of those timeless classic stories and makes for a great tradition for bedtime routines.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I pick up my Kindle Fire HD thinking I will only play a few games but 3 hours later I am still playing! Game is easy to understand with ads only popping up between games.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|One of my all time favorites movies! Not too cheesy romance that makes me cry every time I watch it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Other reviews @ no updates spot on.  I would have bought this from Google Play had I known.  How many other apps have I bought through Amazon that are obsolete??
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great book to take on holiday. Easy reading. Well writen.<br />Will definately read more of these books
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Yeah it&acute;s 2D, but holy cow is it fun and addictive!  The  vehicles are intuitive and the physics are very well done.  I love the moon level, quick way to make some cash and the tank even flies!  Good job with this game, look forward to others  from you guys...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. I am stuck at the moment and can't get out. So, it is also challenging.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I like this book very much.  Entertaining, I almost couldn't stop reading.  I would encourage people to read about the story of Buck and his life.  Good book.
8866137626|4.0|It works seamlessly with Version 5.2. If you have earlier versions or have not read how to use the product, I would imagine the dissatisfaction I see in previous reviews.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Heard about this from coworkers and they said it would be a good movie to purchase.  I have not watched it yet but will soon.  It came super fast.
B00B9B4IYI|4.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and it plays through my Yamaha Receiver with no problems, skips or distortions. I am very happy with my purchase.
1476734941|5.0|This diet is literally one in a million! I can't believe it! I started this diet about a month ago and have lost 15 pounds!! I'm just speechless. I have tried it all. Juicing, low carb diets, strenuous excersises and none of it has worked as good as this has! Every week I'm seeing results. And the funny part is, I don't have to exercise everyday for hours.<br /><br />Before starting this diet, I used to eat complete JUNK! Since starting this diet I'm very proud to say that I have not eaten ANY fast food! I haven't even craved it, it just makes me sick thinking about eating it. It has really changed me to eat healthy foods on a daily basis and not crave something greasy. I knew this diet was working for me was when I was feeling a bit hungover the day after a night out. Usually I will go grab a greasy burger for the cure, but that day I stayed AWAY and didn't crave it AT ALL.<br /><br />One tip I want to give for everyone is to do your fasting days on days that you are busy or at work. It will keep your mind off of feeling the need to snack. Also, it really helps to have someone doing this diet with you. It really keeps you motivated that you both are losing weight together. You can make and plan healthy meals together too!<br /><br />Also, drinking lots of water on your fast days will help keep you feeling full. I have started drinking ONLY water and I'll tell ya it's amazing how your body will change with doing this.<br /><br />Overall, this is a diet that I plan on sticking with for life.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />Just stepped onto the scale for the first time in about a week and I've lost 5 more pounds! 20 down! I couldn't believe it! I had to keep stepping onto the scale to make sure it was right! I keep true to my fast days still, no cheating. And I even drink alcohol on the weekends and I'm STILL losing weight! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DIET!
B00CXQL828|5.0|I love Portnoy and Sheehan, didn't know a whole lot about Kotzen before this was released and then saw him on 'That Metal Show' on VH1-Classic...but was going to buy this if for no other reason than to listen to Mike pound the drums with his crazy talent and Billy thumpin the bass. But, I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised how well they sound together. Kotzen's voice is very close to Chris Cornell's at times so it has a familiar sound when you first listen but then you hear everything come together musically and you realize it's new...and it's well done. It's a nice change of tempo from the typical bands out today. Don't get me wrong, I love AIC, A7X, BFMV, Evans Blue, 3 Doors Down, Otherwise, Aranda, FFDP, Volbeat, etc... but I like this a lot because it's NOT any of those bands or their sounds. There's a lot of copy cats out there that can't come out with their own sound, you won't find that with the Winery Dogs. It's a great mix of fantastic individual musicians that just happen to sound great together! I think you'll like it, I do.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Omg jennifer lawrence embodies sexiness and total dare devil. Cant wait for the sequel... left plenty of room for a cliff hanger. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie was recommended by my grown daughter and my  grandkids loved it...I did not have a chance to see the movie
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Action packed. Left me on the edge of my seat at one point. Movie was a little on the silly side in the beginning but totally picked up the action just right. What a plot.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Just finished this book and for it was very dry and boring.  Got to the 10th chapter and after that it went down hill.  My biggest complaint was a couple of things 1.Chapters too long, 2.and the book was only 34 chapters where as his more recent books were more than twice the length and shorter chapters.  But I will still buy the new one coming out in September.
B000GYI32M|5.0|This is a great series, funny and dramatic.  I am planning to purchase season 4 as well.  Really great characters!
B000JMKNZQ|1.0|This was not even close to as good the original.  It's a collection of one page, clique snippets of &#34;wisdom&#34;.  Read the Alchemist, but leave this!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Who'd of thought comedy and espionage could be combined.  Let alone be done flawlessly.  I loved the way music was intertwined with the scenes and used in the back and forth from action to subtlety.  After seeing this movie, I could not wait for the sequel.  The sequel, RED 2, rocks!!!!
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|over the top stupid gore flick would not recommend to anyone who is sane no horror at all just blood
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am more addicted to this than I was Candy Crush, smooth playing and easy ways to get rewarded and leveled up. very good!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Am ten and I love this game.This is such a fun game to play. I like how you get to play as minions and you get to defeat people and you get to dodge obstacles. I totally recommend this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|This really isn't anything. No games, No recommendation for games, No games to download. I can't see any reason for it and will delete it the next time I think about it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, it is very challenging and intriguing. This game makes the user use their brain in a more complicated way!
B008MM9630|3.0|Not really what I expected but has been fun to fool with as the pictures are great. I will keep it on the Kindle for awhile. It is really more for small children.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|There game is epic . There's awesome jet packs cool gadgets . Crazy vehicles  . And you can get different clothing for him including my personal favorite the Santa suit
0316789704|5.0|Loved these books as a kid.  Bought them for my kids and they spent hours drawing from the examples in the books.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is well worth buying. It has a good Campaign that'll take you about 3-4 hours to complete. An insanely huge multiplayer. the only down sides are the control layout is a bit confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it, and no zombies. BUT its still a very solid game. (Updates Included)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm addicted! I'm on it more than that &quot;crush&quot; game I used to play everyday. The graphics are great-I just wish I could earn gold bars quicker.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie is full of action, just the way I wanted it. So, if you like good acting, humor, and &#34;kick butt; see if movie and judge for yourself. I looked at it twice and loved it both times.<br />G.H.<br />St. Louis
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|This is the first book i have read on my new Kindle Paperwhite.Enjoyed the storyline and by-play between the characters.Easy read and as i have lived in this area where the book is set,it was a bit of a travelogue.Enjoyable read.
B002RI9MWA|5.0|viewing the world from Changez's point of view was both surprising and educational.<br />Also loved the one sided story recollection, it made the book even more interesting.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|A rollercoaster ride across the landscape of the USA. Carey Grant is at his best as a suave unsuspecting Madison avenue salesman falling into the life of drugsmugglers
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having this on my phone and tablet for quick access to Pinterest! It's very useful for when I'm at the store and trying to buy things for something I saw on Pinterest but can't remember everything that I need. I just pull it up on my phone and voila!
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I LOVE THIS WATCH.  IT IS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED, SIMPLE AND ELEGANT. IT IS VERY THIN AND LIGHTWEIGHT. IT IS EASY TO READ.
B00CNGA1PS|4.0|Simple and easy to use.  Finding podcasts is straight forward. Playlist function works well.<br />Auto downlaoding and updating is the best feature of this app.
0201485672|5.0|This is one of the most interesting book about developing I ever read. It changes the way I develop in a very deep way. All examples are in Java, but is also useful to any other Object-Oriented language. It includes what is refactoring, why refactoring, and for sure how to do it throught common cases and examples.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The Harry Potter movies are iconic classics and this lovely set offers the entire collection for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan or wishes to become a fan.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Waste of time,  didn't like at all.  Wish I could figure out how to get it off my Kindle, since I'm just learning how it works.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So think about it people think pc is better than pe because it has more stuff .well I<br />agree but I just got it for the pc . But pe is better in some ways like cyan flower<br />or nether ractor core or the glowing obisitian , invible bedrock and the update block . And I think golden hoe . The best thing is that you can take it with you wherever you go that why it is called pocket edition . What I think is cool is that you can play with it in the middle of the night .
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|I really liked it until I reached level 100 and then I had no pictures to figure out the word.  However I did continue to guess words until I got frustrated.  Level 103 is pretty good,  I think , especially  doing the last levels blind, so to speak.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is awesome! It's funny, suspenseful, and it works your mind a bit. I definitely recommend this show to anyone.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love playing and seeing how far I can get without blocking myself.  Very awesome!!  Ten Stars!!! Love the different designs, also.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This album is absolutely awesome. The songs are catchy and perfectly put together. There also appears to be a spiritual nature to many of the lyrics, making the album rather inspiring. It's the kind of album that you can both exercise to and fall asleep to, because it has a solid beat, but it's also very peaceful to listen to. Best One Republic album yet.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Let's get the Jane Austen paean out of the way: she tells great stories; she has a brilliant ear for dialogue and she has a sparkle of wit.<br /><br />Depend upon it, gentle reader, if you find her hard to read, then it is not yet time for you to read her. Please do not think I would place fault with you. That is not the case. The right time to read her will come.<br /><br />Now that's out of the way, may I suggest you look at this tale as one that also tells of the social changes in England at that time. Note the way merit was able to gain a foothold among inheritance. Also note how so many of the gentry had broken their ties as stewards of an agricultural society.<br /><br />Please don't think I argue for return of the bad old days. Those days were filled with fear of pogroms among my people. What you can, and should, see is how England rode out two hundred years of upheaval in relative calm. (It is true that their revolution and regicide was a century earlier than the French. But so many more wracked Europe in the 1800s, that you have to consider whence came the stability.) Of this, Jane Austen paints a picture dealer than any history.  (In my most humble opinion.)<br /><br />Do read this book.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Loved the whole album.  Would recomend to everyone.<br />Great music for everyone to sing along with.  Its as<br />good as being at the Christian concert
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Enjoyable experience as a dungeon crawler type.  Repetitive maps that manage to still build up.  Even if you plan to drop cash in game this is still a big level replay grind a lot.  I have had no luck with landing an online match, but you can get friend to play with on their own tablet pretty easy.  I enjoy the gameplay.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I really love the new upgrade to doddle jump it's fun with cool new backgrounds sometimes the simple games are the best games
1451668945|4.0|I always am on the lookout for Mary Higgins Clark's books because my 84 yr. old mother loves to read and Ms. Clark's books  contain no ugly curse words or racy topics (that proves you don't need nasty words to write a good book). I like her writing but sometimes figure out the ending long before I am finished with the book. That did not happen in this book and it's a page turner too. I was glad for my mother that she really liked it and the added bonus of enjoying it myself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish there were more levels we really love this game.  I do wish it was an little more difficult butnitnis still super fun.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is really fun i think it is great for kids to play it is so good that you can put your own designs in make up and dress tunnel in long or short dresses
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I ordered this puzzle for students at school.  They were so excited to get it and they love it!  Now they have something fun to do when they finish their work.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I saw the movie last night and was blown away.  I truly look forward to owning this on Blu-ray and re-experiencing it as best possible in my home (7.1 SS / 73\\" DLP).  As a 40-something, I recall the different creature features of the 60's and 70's (Godzilla vs. ...), shows in syndication like Ultraman and even cartoon(ish) shows like Voltron (Ro-Beasts, anyone?) and even (sigh) Power Rangers.  This movie goes beyond all of that, engaging the best aspects of each of the aforementioned and innovates of its own.  This is more than a slugfest of skyscraper sized creations.  It is a survival story of humanity and the human condition, very well presented by Guillermo Del Toro.  For some, the deeper thematics may not appeal.  Others might not buy into the fantastic reality this movie takes place in.  For me, I went in with no expectations and enjoyed it much more than Star Trek Into Darkness (don't screw up Star Wars J.J. Abrams) and Iron Man 3 (miss you Jon Favreau), both of which left me disappointed.<br /><br />I certainly hope this gets a proper treatment in terms of its release as a video (DVD/BD/UV) and is full of special/extra content.  I plan to update this once the release is made.<br /><br />Happy viewing!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|well.if you ask me its a ok game.I play it on my D's so I already know how to do it and all.in my opinion its a three star game only because some things you type in don't work.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|There is no need to talk about content one way or the other on any subject this movie might encompass. First and foremost it is a beautiful, sincere, chest-ache-in-a-good-way love story. Written directly, no fluff. Acted delicately. Filmed carefully. The set of their home is beautiful, simple, clean. The parents are both attractive, considerate, deliberate, loving. The two main actors are both beautiful and sensitive. This is a must see for anyone who is capable of love.
B001HN6EF4|3.0|Uno is a favorite game for us and these were fun for a while but I probably won't use them again.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is an awesome show with great twists and an awesome plot.  I would definitely recommencement watching it to anyone.
B00AFEY354|5.0|and in this moment I swear I was infinite.<br />lol. read the book and both movie/book were amazing. one of my favorites.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I was expecting a hard plastic all around case but this covers the back and side.  it does have a neat design on the back which i didnt notice till i put on my phone.  it has kept my phone pretty safe but it is made of thick rubbery plastic material.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I buy the cartoons and family movies for the neices and nephews that are growing up in my family.  I find myself as well as the parents, watching along and remembering the good ole days.  It's good to be able to have a site where I can find both old and new movies. Thank you
1603420398|4.0|However, I realize I still really can not read and comprehend knitting and/or crocheting instructions!!!<br />Have to go back to another class...
B00005LOUP|5.0|I buy the cartoons and family movies for the neices and nephews that are growing up in my family.  I find myself as well as the parents, watching along and remembering the good ole days.  It's good to be able to have a site where I can find both old and new movies. Thank you
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa,<br />A Great singer and Cd that I can listen to any time of the day . I love her music and better yet I love her voice..
B005F96UNM|3.0|The plot is corny, doesn't really make sense at all. Gackt's Judo scene was the best. so I'll rate this movie a 3 stars for it terrible plot.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I found that if I listen to the album from end to end I start getting tired of the sound. The songs are kind of long for how simple they are. I feel like if you're going to write a seven minute song it should have more changes in it. also theres not a lot of variety in the sound of the vocals . too much droning harmony. However when I mix the album in with some other music I like the songs a lot better individually as opposed to all together. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge AIC fan and am glad they are making music again. I hope they keep at it and  give us some more awesome tunes.
B004L03B3S|4.0|My viewing tastes range from comedy, war, musicals, biographies, documentaries and such so this was something a lot different to add to my viewing repertoire.  I liked the movie...it dealt with issues that are part of the world we live in and gave me a perspective I had not thought of.  This is not for everyone but if you are opened minded and able to watch a movie about relationships within a family and between certain members...then you might enjoy this too.  I wouldn't promote this to everyone...you have to be opened minded or don't watch this.  For me...I would purchase other movies of this nature if it seemed to have relevance to my interests.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|I don't think they are really breaking any new ground or anything, but MAN do these guys do what they do well!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Loved this movie...It's focuses on issues I had not known much about and certainly portrayed Lincoln in a very different light but I completely enjoyed it...I recommend it to anyone who likes movies about Lincoln.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kids love this app.  Good clean fun.  good to see a game with out any violence.  will recommend to all
1781168180|5.0|A great book, and a great insight into how this beautifully crafted film was made. With concept art of the kaiju and the Jaegers, I felt like a little kid again.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|The movie stood on its own rather well.  I enjoyed the action and plot and found it to be just as good as any other action movie.  It only gets 3 stars in my opinion, however, because I feel that it really broke away from what I'd consider the  GI Joe &#34;morality&#34;.  I don't want to give away spoilers, so I won't go into details.  You'll know what I mean when you watch it.  It feels like the director either didn't have a good grasp on GI Joe, or tried to really evolve it into something darker.  I never went too deep deep into the comics, so I don't know if it follows them or not, but I'd have liked to have seen something more in line with the first movie or the animated series.<br /><br />All that being said, it is worth watching, just watch it while pretending it isn't based on the GI Joe that we grew up with and loved.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I haven't played mtg in years but this game makes me feel like I'm getting ignored by girls in high school all over again. it's great fun.<br /><br />good<br />plays like it should. runs well on my first gen fire. great art and solid deck building interface. lots of replayability once you get your feet under you.<br /><br />bad<br />if you are a true mtg novice you'll need a few games to get the hang of it. the deck selection doesn't seem to allow for a scratch start. the booster battles shouldn't be tried until you have a few wins with a few decks under your belt.<br /><br />in all<br />I was willing to pay the rather high price and I'll be dammed if the get a singal dime iap from me. heafty tag for a good game with iap option for an I win button.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Female protagonist.  Actually has a plot and was not written for a 13 year old.  Reminds me of an old tale I read as a young adult called Level 7.  Much more complicated but also read like the author got tired at the end.  I am reading the entire saga and do recommend reading this tale.  Reading \\"Shift\\" at the moment.  The tale is dark but always offers hope.  An excellent commentary on the nature of the beast.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Journey back to a time so different from today! Loved visiting the lives of all the different characters from all the different classes of people.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book based on other's ratings. I am glad I did. Completely gripping from the first page. It is fast paced with fantastic twists and character development. I would highly recommend this book. Looking forward to reading the prequel and sequel next!
193700788X|5.0|I love the series.<br /><br />I even have all the side stories books.<br /><br />However...  The ending of the book was making me shake my head.  WHAT?!!!!  SERIOUSLY???  REALLY????!!!!!<br /><br />Ugh.  I am sadden.  I sure hope this next follow up book have alternative endings.  Maybe one I was hoping to have read.<br /><br />I still have faith in you Mrs. Harris.  Give me what I want more S + E!!!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We downloaded this for our airplane ride and the kids watched it twice. As usual, it was an easy process.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|When I first sat down to watch Dredd I thought, how could they possibly not make this cheesy. But holy hell I was blown away. This is just a plain good action packed sci-fi flick. Karl Urban delivers a fantastic performance for never seeing his face. Also be warned, it is very graphic and violent. But if you are into dark sci-fi this is a fantastic choice.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We downloaded this for our airplane ride and the kids watched it twice. As usual, it was an easy process.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great start to a future series of Reacher movies.  I just hope subsequent releases do not go over the top as so many other series have.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Another gorgeous cd from Marc Anthony. Love it!!! I was surprised to see he included beautiful songs like \\"Hipocrecia\\" and \\"Copa Rota\\" Wow! What a great album!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I love this game I played it but the only problem is that you have to buy the rest of the game 4$s is an outrage for kids
0670026557|5.0|In relationships, there are three types of people: givers, takers, and matchers. Givers believe in giving to a relationship. They ask what more they can give to a relationship and not what can they receive. Takers, conversely, exploit people and ask how focus on how they can benefit from  a relationship. Finally, matchers keep score and strive to give as much as they receive.<br /><br />Mark Twain remarked “The principle of give and take; that is diplomacy--give one and take ten.” (1) After admitting that the people who are walked over most in business are givers, Grant explains that the most successful people are also givers. The difference between the two people, Grant explains, is how they give.<br /><br />There are two types of givers: selfless givers and otherish givers. Grant writes, “Selfish givers are people with high other-interest and low self-interest.” (157) He continues, “They give their time and energy without regard for their own needs, and they pay a price for it.... it is a form of pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. (157) These types of givers find themselves at the bottom of the business world.<br /><br />Successful givers, contrastingly, “...care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.” (157) “Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give.” For example, Adam Rifkin, a software developer, was voted the number one networker in the world. Adam lived by the five minute rule: : if a favor takes fewer than five minutes then do it. (54) While Adam is a tremendous giver, he always kept his own personal goals, as a software developer and entrepreneur, inmind.<br /><br />Being a giver is not always easy. Grant warns that givers are more trusting and believe in people more often. This leads to more opportunities for people to disappoint them. “[matchers] often wait to offer support until they’ve seen evidence of promise. Consequently, they miss out on opportunities to develop people who don’t show a spark of talent or high potential at first.” (101) Takers, well... they are just not worth discussing.<br /><br />Grant’s book is inspiring citing the development of countless other people who have succeeded as givers and companies or ideas such as freecycle that have developed with a philosophy of giving as its core.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great old time classic movie. Great for dreamers and fans of Bing Crosby and crew, Rosemary Clooney, ... A heart warming story from the good ol' times.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I chose this product because my husband and I are avid animal lovers.<br /><br />We thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it to our friends and family.<br /><br />I enjoy seeing movies produced by not so famous producers to see how just using your talents can bring you recognition.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book brought me closer to understanding what the populace was going through while World war tore apart their world.
B00902MCVY|5.0|The best metal I have ever heard in my life! This albums is truly a journey.<br /><br />Also the shipping was quick and the quality of the packaging was fine.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I like the fresh faces, great voices and fun music in this film.  I am sorry that there is so many sexual jokes, it takes away from the overall enjoyment, but the singing is great, the characters are quirky and (spoiler alert) the girl gets the guy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and cant stop playing it... its a great game for fans and is good when you go inside and then outside. great great game 10/10!!!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|It. Was. Awesome. Simple as that. No other explanation is needed. This is one of the best mystery novels I have ever read
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is a fun game it has great graphics it's role playing and you could get the venom suit on the game you fight enemies in a huge massive 3d New York city it's just like the one for game consoles
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This a great game!  it is very addictive and lots of great fun trying to get out of the rooms!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subways surfers is a great game kids and grownups it's really great because you have to complete missions an  sometimes there hard and easy subway surfers is a real great game to me and that's how I would describe subway suffers.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I enjoyed the perspective and language used in this book, as well as the hero/anti hero Harry Hole.<br />Can't believe the author used this name for his main character.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|I like every thing the stars are in - it's kind of like getting your favorite Pizza, you just know you'll enjoy it.
B00114RKT8|5.0|The subject of this movie is one that should be heard and seen by everyone. It changed the course of History. It is a movie that I would enjoy viewing again.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|It never hurts to have a lot of really good, creative music around and this more than fits the bill.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No instructions. Could not figure it out. Maybe I'm just too dumb. I don't play these kind of games much . I prefer reading.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Steve Carell is awesome as Gru - there is nothing of Steve's usual character mockups in this. Gru is a totally original character.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This album has a great variety of songs.  It is SEXY and EDGY.  I like every song on the album!  Excellent job Bruno Mars!!!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Just goes to show that it doesn't matter what the setting is, a Love Story is still a Love Story. And I love Love Stories.
B00005N5S5|5.0|That's from Predator...... The Terminator is a great movie. As far as James Cameron's mindless blockbusters go, this is one of the classic greats. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Beihn, Sarah Conner (that's sexist that I can't remember her name), and then Bishop from 'Aliens'. Great movie, great cast, great dvd. Recommend to a friend that likes Arnold Schwarzenegger.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Very fast service and a great film!!  Saw this on a flight to Italy and bought it right after I returned from vacation.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Fantastically weird. Kind of like 'What's eating Gilbert Grape' on acid. Jake Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Seth Rogen, Randy Quaid's oldest son from 'Independence Day,' and a bunch of other actors/actresses whose names I can't remember. Great story, great acting, weird writing, but overall it's pretty trippy. Recommend to a friend who likes sci-fi, but doesn't study physics.
0060752610|5.0|One of the classics.  On most major investors must read lists.  You won't be disappointed if you take the time to read this one.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Great movie. Watch it more than once. Saw it in the theater and was like &#34;great, but dafuq?&#34; Then I watched it again later on and was like &#34;aww yeah!&#34; Own it now, great dvd, great movie. Couldn't be happier, unless of course Gary himself came and took me out to lunch. Or Benedict for that matter :D &#60;3 Swooon. recommend to a friend who likes Cold War Spy movies and Gary Oldman.
0865479410|5.0|Reading this book will make you happy! If you are having trouble reaching happiness using other suggestions then I suggest using this book as a guide to happiness! Step 1: stop using guides to happiness. They do not work. Worse! They make you unhappy because they do not work. Hence, avoid trying to feel happy and guess what! Yes. But what if you can't stand people who thrive on negative thinking? Actually, this feels like an update to the Stoic philosophy but with a Buddhist slant. But for the moment let me disidentify from  thoughts. Ah! There. That is better.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I love it. it was very nice movie. i like it. i hope see the movie againe. thank you .
B005HED08I|5.0|I just happen to love Star Trek. I am getting it through my Kindle.  I think that is great.  Streaming video.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out and it has been one of our all time favorites. This copy is fantastic in Blu-ray and loved reliving that moment from long, long ago in the comfort of our family room!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very spicy and worth reading. Absolutely loved this book. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time
B00506NRBS|4.0|Practical, yet philosophical insights on knowing who you are and what makes you happy ... and how that can add up to business success.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The graphics on this are great! Hard to put down once you start playing. The whole family enjoys playing this game.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Once again , the developers at Fallen Tree Games have given us countless hours of sheer bliss! Quell has always been my favorite game and this version has surpassed the original two with fresh new puzzles that are a delightful way to spend some quiet time. The music is brilliant and the voice of the old man adds a touch of whimsy. If you haven't played any of the others you should not hesitate to get all three because you will want as much of this pleasant experience as you can get. And the prices are an absolute  bargain for what you get. Well done guys , VERY well done indeed! I wish I could give these games 20 stars.<br />.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It keeps crashing. I haven't been able to play even once. I saw many great reviews and was severely disappointed because it wasn't working. All I am able to see is the Game loft loading screen then it goes back to my phone home screen.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I decided to read Fifty Shades of Grey because of all the hype about it but I was really disappointed to say the least. The only good thing about reading this book was the part that I was reading a book. I will say it started out good and had a good twist but through out the whole book I kept rolling my eyes because the story was just not that great. It was just so unreal and I understand its not based on a true story but really this virgin girl who falls for no apparent reason because she is so clumsy and has never fallen in love before is going to have sex like 15x a day and then fall in love with this supposedly hot controlling guy who likes to abuse woman! The worst part is all the repeating and the verbiage used. This book overall was okay not worth paying for okay to read if it's free and you have nothing else to do. I definitely don't care to read part two or three just not worth it in my opinion....
B00CWY76CC|2.0|The lack of instructions makes this game kind of frustrating at times.  They aren't really puzzles, more like &quot;let's see how many times I'm going to randomly tap my screen before something happens.&quot;  Sure, you need short term memory for some of the patterns, but overall I think this app is a waste of memory for my device.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I didn't consider this a great app to begin with, but it was ok and I used it fairly often.  After the latest update, I removed it from my device.  Others have pointed out the ways this app was ruined.  Very disappointing.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Terrible movie, waste of time and money, I did not even finish watching it and I enjoy these type of movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. It is so addicting. Most of the levels are pretty challenging I only had a problem with level 10. Other than that great game. I cant wait for more levels.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Yes, I'm older but I still use a MAC, edit and create home movies.  I have an iPhone 5 and know how to use iCloud and iTunes Match.  My disdain for this movie is not that I \\"didn't get it\\".  It was simply the worst movie and I should have known that when we entered the theater.  I had a house guest (a very well known artist from NYC) and we decided to catch a movie.  When we took our seats for this movie we noticed that we were the only two people in the room and given that it was only the second week the movie had been out and given the fact that it was a Friday night in a suburb of Nashville, TN we should have known it was going to be a stinker.  Not only was it a stinker....it was a MAJOR STINKER.  These people who write these redeeming reviews for this film must work for the distributor of the film, the studio that made the film or be friends with one of the production or acting staff of the movie.<br /><br />I have a masters degree from GeoTown Univ and I am not one who is \\"failing to appreciate the uniqueness of the film\\".  It was a piece of garbage and I would be very surprised if it is not the beginning of the end of Tom Cruise's aging career.  The only surprise in the film was that Morgan Freeman accepted a role in the film.<br /><br />If you still purchase this film on DVD or Blu Ray then you deserve to kick yourself for wasting your money.  I think the box office take for this film says it all....disastrous!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fast paced and really fun. easy to play and to catch on  how to increase your levels.  very cute characters.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I didn't want the HELP  GUIDE !! I  wanted to download the GAME onto my Kindle. I've deleted it from my unit
0143039431|4.0|and it cost more . this is the same book the store in Houston tx. but not the high price . and and its a good book
B003VANOFY|5.0|great headset, clear, 7.1 very good for movie, game skype, i brought one for myself and one for my son
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|The pro kit should just be free or already there.  Not 1dollar and 99 cents. The patients say stupid  things<br /><br />  IT IS SO STIUPIDLY DUMBBBBBBB!!!<br />  I HATE IT SOOOOOO MUCH!!!
0345525558|5.0|When i picked this book it was because of the title. Once I started Istarte it I could not put it down.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I really enjoyed this concert. This is the second All Starr Band concert I have purchased and it was great. I will be looking at others.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This CD is pretty short, but each song is unique and filled with great melodies and lyrics. Most albums have one or two really good songs, but this one just has so many, each with its own unique sound. Soul Wars, Jump on my shoulders, People, Sail, Knights of Shame are absolutely incredible. They have so much energy and make you feel beetter about your day.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I got this from the Amazon App Store on the free app of the day.  I used the free one before so getting the $14.95 license for free is fantastic.  I don't us&eacute; all the features but it is nice to have them in cas&eacute; I need to in the future.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Even though Eragon is still new, and his true strength is still not yet fully developed he has earned the right to be called a dragon rider. He has acquired a true rider's sword, Brisingr, and has wielded it in battle. He has helped slay another shade. Sadly he and Saphira have lost forever their teachers, Oromis and Glaedr, but they look forward to their future as dragon and rider.<br />Well told Christopher Paolini!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|What a fantastic perfect movie to watch with your girlfriends, sisters, or daughters! We laughed out loud, awhed a couple of times and sang through the entire movie. My daughter(7) has to watch it once a day.....cant say i blame her this movie has been the perfect summer blockbuster this year.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really makes you think and look in places you didn't think would help you. I just wished it had a hint button on some of them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to read books on my tablet, there is a great variety of subjects available Love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome you can play with your  friends. I don't know how to join a game on 7.1 because you half to have a account.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Great way to time kill time on my Kindle fire.  No complaints what so ever.  Try it and don't look back!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This has helped me improve my writing skills and understanding of creating a book. I'm not done yet but I hope it will be something that everyone will enjoy.<br />Thank you so much!!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It was a great game for those who like look for objects in a room for hours.<br />Great graphics.<br />Amazing
B003F9G8B8|4.0|I watched this the day before Mandela's 95th birthday this year. This man has lived an amazing life, and this beautiful and thrilling story focuses on just a small chapter of it. But even in this limited view, Clint Eastwood manages to completely convey Mandela's philosophies on courage and leadership. Morgan Freeman plays the part perfectly, and Matt Damon delivers as well. Highly recommend!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It is small and makes for attentive sharpening but for the price it works well.  Very compact and weighs almost nothing.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Pretty good movie. My daughter liked it and so dod I. It kept her giggling and I had to laugh a few times at it myself.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|each actor plays their part very well<br />love to hear the english speak<br />it's the nice little 'soap opera&#34; but not really
B005H9B2CE|4.0|The actors are all great, I liked the plot and it is an exciting action/marvel comic movie. Would watch again.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works fine and downloads the book choices.  I wish it included a non-rotation feature for reading in bed.  But other than that seems to do just fine and you can adjust fonts and a few color choices to change the look of the text.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|In James Clavell's Shogun, I believe this is art at its finest.<br /><br />Clavell gets into each characters thoughts and feelings so expertly that it's difficult to remember that these are not real people living a real life.  Not only that, but Clavell also makes changes to his character's thought processes as well to make them more alive to readers.  This is important because no one is uniformly eloquent as we all have flaws.  And now, thanks to Clavell, so does Mariko, Blackthorne, Rodrigues, Toranaga, Buntaro, Omi, Yabu and a host of others, no matter how small of a part they play in his novel.<br /><br />It is mind boggling to me how Clavell so brilliantly wove and interwove plots, schemes, scenarios and spies and kept them separate from one another only to bring them together. The reader is drawn into the novel like no other.  I read this novel a very long time ago and I am amazed at how much I remembered from the first read.  Also, I am amazed at how much I loved this book then and now.<br /><br />Clavell was brilliant, to say the least, and this is truly art.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game. Wastes a lot of free time. Fun every time I play again and again time and time again
B0060FXDCG|5.0|i love this series.  over been watching the first twerp movies for years, over and over again.  i finally saw the third movie and loved it.  another movie marathon set.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is what I needed it works great. Thanks for this. I could probably use a 8 or ten ft. version of this item.
0060523808|4.0|This is a book which every business should try to get a hand on. It's an easy read with little business jargon. It gives insights about the hard part of running a business and more so when it's in trouble. It also underlines the importance of having a vision and strategic planning in place for running a successful business.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Tried this with multiple apps on two different MacBook Pros.  It generated only a minimal level of audio, and then only if I yelled into it.  Verified that the battery is good and installed correctly.  It's just plain broken.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Done very well! Absolutely love the addition of seal play. I'm playing on kindle fire HD without a hitch. If your a mtg fan you need this game :)!
B003B96AOW|5.0|Amazing detail on this figure. Features tons of weapons, 2 pistols, 2 sais, 2 swords, and a rifle. This is the best deadpool figure you can find anywhere. The Marvel Diamond Select line, is the best line of action figures for display that you can find anywhere. They have the details of a statue, but are poseable to be displayed any way you want!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was a very enthralling book. I read many sci-fi novels and Maze Runner definitely is one of the most interesting I have discovered. I found that it can be compared to The Hunger Games. Though it can get graphically violent at times I would recommend it for young men specifically and young people in general who have a adventurous spirit with a thirst to figure out puzzles and reason. If you read this be sure to use every clue and see if you would be able to escape the Maze!
B00AH69MS8|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said elsewhere but better? It's one of the greatest albums of all time, regardless of genre. It's influence is known far and wide and it has possibly the best track set Metallica has ever put out. Unless you absolutely hate metal, there is zero reason you shouldn't have this in your music collection.
B0060D11LI|1.0|This was not what I intended to buy. It showed up as a DVD and the quality is terrible. I'm very unhappy this is what I ended up with.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I don't know what the others Where saying, but for me it just froze my kindle fire. It even removed ALL my photos, it even wouldn't let me take photos or save them. And by the time it was downloaded, ( two weeks later!!! ) I wasn't Able to play it because it froze my kindle. So I removed it from my kindle and the cloud, and only THEN I got my photos back. I'm sure for others, it's a great app, but for me it didn't work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Neveer played a game so funny nd great ill love to share this game wit the world its the most exciting games made
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I spent 99 cents for it on the kindle fire, didn't install or download. Now the app just has a yellow bar and is in limbo. Nice wasting time like that. Stick with temple run 2.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing best app ever<br />Needs free riding and breeding though other than that I LOVE this app it's the best app ever
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is a great movie and the quality of the 3D is wonderful.  I like the fact that it came w/three discs and along w/our guests enjoying the movie, one guest was lucky enough to leave w/1 disc of their own!
030758836X|3.0|Story is very inventive- but makes you wonder just why these people did what they did. And yes, you can see how it all happened ---- but do we really care?
B006H5120E|5.0|Of course the story of this movie is enthralling and the 3D effects are mezmerizing!  I could watch it over and over and our guests really enjoyed it as well.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I may think twice about eating out after reading this description of working kitchens. Very interesting look at the culture of the food prep industry.
8866134627|2.0|I've been using the standard Ruled Moleskine notebook as a daily work journal for years. I typically start a new page on a new day, start with a To Do list of what's up for the day, and take notes during meetings from there below. I thought the layout of this Professional Notebook was interesting, as it had a sidebar for a To Do list, and some other sections. Ultimately, I found it too restrictive for my needs.<br /><br />By far the most disappointing thing was the quality of the paper. I write with a fountain pen, and the ink bled through the paper as if I was writing with a permanent marker. In my experience with the standard Ruled Notebook, their core product, the ink does not bleed through the paper.<br /><br />Moleskine was prompt to reply to my quality complaint. They noted that none of their pages are really suited for fountain pens--but it was clear from my experience that the paper in this book is a bit different, perhaps thinner, than in standard books. I must note that Moleskine offered to send me a Ruled Notebook as a replacement. Great company, but was not pleased with this particular product.<br /><br />If you write with a &#34;dry ink,&#34; as Moleskine recommended, you will likely not notice a difference with the quality of the paper.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|I love this movie. You know you are in dangerous territory when you make a movie out of order. This movie was confusing. You are just as baffled as the main character, who has lost his ability to form all new short-term memories! And yet, the movie works. As the movie progresses, it gets more and more confusing, and yet you begin to put more and more pieces together. It's never predictable, and when you finally learn what happened to cause it all, it actually makes sense. A very well-done and well-acted film.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Time after time I have wanted to pick up the violin and learn how to play one myself but I have never been more inspired to play one than after listening to this CD. Lindsey Stirling is an amazing artist and I enjoyed every second of this Album
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is the best card game ever because kids can learn colors<br /> and or numbers also its great when your on lunch break with you err friends and you can have fun with out being board so yes it's a very cool app
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Awesome!!! Great story with several clever twists. I enjoyed the book more than most, but it was what I have come to expect.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this book! Percy Jackson is back and Jason grace is amazing!<br />I can't wait for house of Hades!<br />Rick has done it again!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So many twists and turns...all so unexpected and frustrating. You learn to love to hate this book but you keep coming back for more.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|My Twyla arrived VERY quickly, and is just adorable.  She and her box were in perfect condition! I would highly recommend her for any Monster High fan!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|so far I like the game. as long as I can keep playing without spending money I will. keep up the great work.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The actors are brillant, but one of the very best aspects of this movie, was Dustin Hoffman's decision to use real retired musicians rather than actors for the inhabitants of the retirement home! Stunning!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! It is a great running game with lots of fun twists to it. And the best part is, it's with minions! I would recommend it to anybody.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought it was the end of a trilogy and got thrown for a loop there but overall I thought it was a great read
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game was well worth the money.. I cant wait for the next one to come out..<br />it was exciting and always kept me guessing...  I loved the puzzles.. its is absolutely worth the money..
0345531957|5.0|This is another great book by Mr. Grisham.  He never comes through with a great story and believeable characters.  Hard to put down the book most of the time.
B000053VAF|5.0|A very interesting story, good characters played by excellent choices of actors and actresses. This story has something for everyone.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Only one level over and over nothing new complete waste of space. no one wants to do the same thing over and over
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book helped close as lot of questions for me. On the hurt and pain the main characters have been facing. The characters will to be together was well written. I was able to connect to the overwhelming need and passion they feel. The characters allow you to connect to them more then just sexual. Which I find satisfying and refreshing. This book is also sexy as he'll. :)
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I was really disappointed in this game because Dungeon Hunter 3 was so much fun and it was simple yet intricate with its simplicity. To me, the fourth Dungeon Hunter loses that aspect and it is simply not as smooth as the third game before it.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I downloaded this but it wouldn't come up on my apps so I went to appstore and downloaded it again because it didn't say open.then it says Vevo is already on your device so I finally got to download it again and it didn't show up so I had to go to the Amazon appstore to click open.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Been a long time since I had a chance to watch MacGyver. Started with the first one couldn't belive it was yesterday I remember everything.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Allows you to play the same game but from different angles to play with, as well as, an appropriately gradual slide in difficulty. Plus, never deals the same way. Even after lengthy play time.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|You could say that the double live album was what defined 70's rock music.From the multi-platinum success of \\"Frampton Comes Alive!\\" and a great package of songs done with voice box for special effects, to the best live hard rock recording in UFO's \\"Strangers In The Night\\", along comes McCartney& Wings' pushing the envelope a bit with what would become stretched out into a Triple live LP in the era of Vinyl as \\"Wings Over America\\"now remastered with a bonus disc of eight tracks from a gig at the Cow Palace in San Francisco.Unlike Led Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" which didn't do Jimmy Page& Company any justice up until 27 years later with \\"How the West was Won\\",\\"Wings Over America \\" doesn't disappoint in the least.From the opening intro to \\"Venus&Mars\\" the ten minute plus squeeze in of \\"Rock Show\\"with reference to the afore mentioned Jimmy Page and segueing into \\"Jet\\" makes for an entertaining start to the proceedings.Rockin' on with \\"Let Me Roll It\\",\\"Spirits Of Ancient Egypt\\",&the cautionary anti-drug anthem \\"Medicine Jar\\",Paul slows things down a bit with the wonderful ballad \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" The RnB stylings of \\"Call Me Back Again\\" give way to a couple of Beatles offerings in\\"Lady Madonna\\"&\\"The Long And Winding Road\\" which sound downright terrific.We are then offered the dramatic 007 anthem \\"Live&Let Die\\" followed by some unplugged fare,the forgettable \\"Picasso's Last Words\\"and the filler\\"Richard Cory\\".Sandwiched in between the better Beatles unplugged numbers of \\"Blackbird\\"&\\"Yesterday\\" comes the acoustical pop of \\"Bluebird\\" which makes for a nice touch.Disc2 opens with a 1920's rag time ditty of \\"You Gave the Answer\\" which segues into my favourite track from the \\"Venus&Mars\\" album being \\"Magneto&Titanium Man\\" which sounds just as good as the studio version.Then we give way to ex-Moody Blues and current Wings guitarist Denny Laine's first ever Moody's single \\"Go Now\\" which gives way to Paul's orchestrated ballad \\"My Love\\" then it's the jazz-pop elements of \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\" with its fine saxophone playing.Then along comes a masterful pop ditty in\\"Let 'em In\\",filler in\\"Time to Hide\\"&\\"Letting Go\\".Paul\\"s jazz-pop inflections on the hit single off \\"Speed of Sound\\" in \\"Silly Love Songs\\" sounds good next to the best rockin' track off \\"Speed of Sound\\" in \\"Beware My Love\\" the prog rocking tile track to \\"Band On the Run\\" and Paul's no slouch either with his best hard rock song ever in \\"Hi,Hi ,Hi\\" while closing things out on a high note with \\"Solly\\".Overall a triumph of sorts ,though I wish Paul could have included \\"Helen Wheels\\",\\"Junior's Farm\\",or even \\"Sally Jean\\"The bonus disc doesn't offer anything different from the previous two but it's okay on its own.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is fantastic and the suits each have different abilities. There are even the suits from the movie. You should get this game.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I personally loved this record. I know a few people that don't like the new direction but Daft Punk is always changing.  Always creating something new.  Best part was got 2 digital copies one from amazon and one from the record itself.  in my opinion 5 stars and I would diffidently recommend this to a friend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game! It's so fun and kills time! It never glitches or has problems. I love the little minions!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Item was of the most greatest quality. Remarkably magnificent delivery. Packaging was first-rate. Remarkably pleased. A+! Item was of the most transcendent quality! Delivery was remarkably quick. Notably welcome packaging. Notably pleased. A++
1557048630|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and looking at the terrific concept art put into it. I have high hopes for what will happen in the next movie and hope to get the art book for that one too.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|It's Kid Rock!  Such a talented musician/singer/songwriter.  When Rebel without a cause came out it was a while before I even listened to his music because I thought it would be something I wouldn't like.  When I finally listed to it I loved every song and all of his albums since have been the same - every song is good.  Not too many musicians can produce album after album where you want to listen to the whole album and not just a song or two.  I have been to 7 of his concerts and every one of them have been excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is the best because when you  get caught you can use some of your keys and you could also use hoverboards to save your self.
B00A7KKPDK|3.0|I love Ellen, but this book was not what I was hoping it would be.  When I watch her show I can not stop laughing and I thought this book would have me doing the same.  There were parts that I found myself chuckling, but overall I felt like I was taken on a trip I just wanted to get off of through her disorganized scattered thoughts.  If you want a lighthearted book and don't mind feeling a little discombobulated jumping around from idea to idea, then try reading it.  I will be patiently waiting for Finding Dory to come out in theaters.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|To Sell Is Human is a compelling read that is part story book, and part workbook, and  which will leave you entertained, insprired, and thinking about all of the things that you can do to not just sell an idea to someone but deliver the solution that solves a problem. The section on Clarity reminded me very much of the classic book [[ASIN:B004WOXYV2 Are Your Lights On?]]. The only negative thing I can say about this (and most Dan Pink books really) is that they leave you with so many ideas and resources to pursue, that finishing the book is just the beginning of the reading project.
159463176X|4.0|Almost everyone I know loved this author's first book, THE KITE RUNNER. It had its blemishes here and there, but all in all, it was a very compelling read and a good story. I could not put that book down. I was not a fan of the second one, and while this is a better read, I still loved the first one most.  There are many threads here and some sagging in the middle; I was not wowed.<br /><br />(I would give it 3.5 stars) It's unfortunate that big-pushed reads like this one gets such huge attention-there are so many out there that are better than this but get barely one inch of the attention.
B0031R5K68|4.0|More of the same, not bad, but not mindblowing either.<br />It's kind of sad that at the beginning I guessed where it would end and I was right.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love it.  i would recommend this series to everyone.  it is well done and gives a snapshot of how things were in that era.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It's one of my favorite classics. The writing style , characters, chapters, plot, and everything about this book is beautiful!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|If you like to enjoy a movie where dialogues have some sarcasm and intelligent lines, this movie would be the right choice. I like it  and I laugh a lot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Enjoyed the game. Excellent graphics. Would recommend to anyone. Keep up the good work and look forward to the updates.
B006BG7RI0|4.0|I like Casablanca. It is the best movie that I watched. If you would like to have a good copy with a nice souvenirs this product brings you a beautiful poster and other souvenirs.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is definitely the most amazing game I have ever played!!! For those of you who are wondering if you should get the game , GET IT!!!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|At the beginning I felt that I made a mistake when I chose to watch this movie; however, I found that it was the best choice that I do. Good play and actors.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|the first is way better this got me bored after the too minutes very blotchy!!!!!!!!!! the original game is not at all I reccomend the origanal better just sayin ... yup
0345803485|5.0|my wife has read it a few times.  She likes the story but thinks there is too much sex.  one two three four five six seven eight nine
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|I really am not sure I want to b a doctor in the medical school but this doesn't exactly mean that if u play this game then you'll be able too you have to buy the rest off the game four $ rlly how bout 99 cents plz I mean b real who would buy that other then that fun game
6302150930|4.0|good movie.  despite the fact it is vhs and dvd is way overpriced.  seven more words required one two three
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I thought it was a really cute game and it's a lot of fun!!!!!! :) it is also similar to many of the other running games. but I didn't like that it took sooooo long for it to download... but overall, I like the game a lot!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Get this. Play it. Get addicted. It's that simple. One of the best apps I've played in a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome because I love horses and its like taking care of a real horse like mine named lucky
B005F3XV7Q|5.0|Kevin James is a great comedian and he obviously makes a lot of people laugh hilariously. ZOOKEEPER has plenty of good laughs and great humor from all the animals including the role of the lion played by yours truly SYLVESTER STALLONE. This movie also sends out a clear message to all its viewers that don't ever take an animal for granted, just love and respect them as they were your own pets. There are plenty of ZOOKEEPERS around the world, but the one who can actually hear the animals talking must be a very special one to them.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Being from Philadelphia, the scenery, dialogue, and cast made us feel right at home. A good story line, and a good ending--we'll be watching it again, I'm sure.
B0071AKB38|5.0|great unit, sound is fantastic is so small but gigantic sound effects. superb. for office or small room listening pleassure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun it gets u excited and worked highs highs highs highs highs this game is fun is this could be
B009439HEY|5.0|As close as you're going to get to the originals. Hackett put together an Allstate cast including Phil Collins' son for this album.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|Fantastic I have never read a book like this before. Great job by Jeff Kinney hats off to him. Great
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this on every device I own. It's so great to carry my books with me, so I have reading I can do while waiting for hubby, or in the doctor's office, or wherever. And I have cookbooks, so I can browse new recipes as well as have them at my fingertips while shopping. Love it! (Just wish they'd let us group our books!!)
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite shows of all time. I was very happy to receive this boxed set as a gift! However, for some type-A personalities it may not be the best organization because the seasons are not separated. There are six disc jackets which fit a handful of dvds each, adding up to a total of 40 discs. But as any friends fan knows, there are 10 seasons, not 6! So it may bother some people that the seasons do not each have their own separate disc jacket. For me, I'm just happy to have every single Friends episode available to watch any time I want. =]
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a perfect movie for those near or at retirement. The quirky group work extremely well together. I ended up loving each of their personal stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. its fun. it passes time. I feel like I really have a horse. but it freezes sometimes
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|OH GOD THIS BOOK IS AMAZING I LITERALLY COULD NOT PUT MY KINDLE DOWN AND I JUST FINISHED IT AND I'M CRYING. IT KIND OF JUST ENDED WITH AUGUSTUS'S LETTER, BUT I'D HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HOW LONG HAZEL LIVED AFTERWORDS, OR IF SHE HAD SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVED. WOW I CAN'T STRESS HOW GREAT THIS IS. A+ JOhN GREEN, A+.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is very funny and I loved the insights to the behind-the-scenes moments to Tina' s iconic role as Sarah Palin.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is fun but it's a copy off of sub way surfers and its the minion runs so fast you can't really do good so I like subway surfers a lot better that's why I gave it three stars
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|just play it. it is so much fun. it feels as if they are yohlur actual pets. because you treat them as if it's your pet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game it makes me feel closer to horses but I wish it was easier to get gems
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just touch the card you want to move and it knows where to go, dragging the cards is not required.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Cool game and been loving these Angry Birds series . Each series has unique distinguishing attributes and new and almost similar features, like powered birds and the cursor when launching the birds, which really helps a lot! Humorous gameplay between these brave, suicidal birds and keep up the good work! 👍😎
B001IF5YLQ|4.0|this is a nice piece of equipment that is very cheap and allows you to display one image on to two screens. Very convenient if you like to open multiple windows.
B005HSL626|5.0|...Or at least uses them to train and hone skills. Regardless, a fun game to play with awesome things to unlock from the sensei swag himself, or at least his inventory (:D). Keep up with the good work 👍😃
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Love everything about the album and the band. I have both albums and I am now a HUGE fan. I can't think of anything that I actually dislike about the band/appearance/music/album.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded this in my Kindle Fire HD and it looks amazing and still gets me addictive with the familiar gameplay! I love how more things got added to this game like the vehicle and some items. I would like to see more updates with this app and please do continue making this game better!! 😎
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I just wanted to know more about Katniss ans Peeta. The reason diverge hunger games and will they end it for good ...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Many levels and the challenge increases through completions, and it's fun to play as you're mind bent in solving a level. Good game :)
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this app is great its realistic and good just to pass the time or have a little war with your friends
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy, convenient, more complex symbols...got me hanging on with this app whenever I need it. And out if all those calculator apps, I chose this one. :)
B009AJDET6|5.0|Let's face it, Chicago is NOT the group it used to be, it was that way once they started making albums in the 80's. This boxed set takes me back to the days of my youth, where my dad would put his old Chicago records on and we'd listen to them nonstop! 1969-1978 was their golden age and their time to shine; there was never another group like them, save for Blood, Sweat, & Tears, Dreams, and The Ides of March, who are superb groups in themselves, plus, all these albums have been digitally re mastered; heck, I've heard music in this boxed set that I've never heard before and I love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I haven't forgot to play this app, but hope you guys aren't either. This what set the stage up for its sequel and beyond. Hope this game gets more something added on to it and not just being left behind.
B001886LQU|5.0|This was definitely one of the more interesting movies that came out in theatres that summer. Everyone says it's the &#34;Godzilla&#34; that should have been, but I beg to differ. Roland and Dean's version of &#34;Godzilla&#34; met with a LOT of negative reviews from both critics and viewers, but myself, along with many others thought it was a very good movie, as is Cloverfield! Both movies were the talk of the box office due to the amount of previews and hype they had; all in all, both Godzilla and Cloverfield stand alone as great movies in themselves, the latter centered around the story of: &#34;What would happen if an unknown monster invaded the east coast? How would we really handle it, and would we be able to defeat it?&#34; Abrams himself has always had that interesting creativity about him, and Cloverfield definitely proves it!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|When all things fail, having a tablet to play chess on the go instead of carrying a board around is a huge advantage for me, especially a good chess app! Maybe I missed this out, but would be cool to play against someone else on the same app or even online with others. Also would be nice to be able to get new boards or pieces to play, or at least to be able to unlock them. Wouldn't it be fun to be able to beat the computer a certain number if times to unlock cool stuff? Just saying. But thanks overall and keep up the good work! 👍😎
B004EPYZPS|5.0|The title I wrote pretty much says it all; the creativity and imagination of both Abrams and Spielberg ends up in being a masterpiece that any sci-fi fan would enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm already familiar with this prestigious game app and played it a lot in my iPhone. Now I decided to download it again in my Kindle HD and it looks great and even better! Also love it how you guys add new stuff to this app and those weekly/daily challenges sure helps as well. Thanks and keep up the good work!! 👍😎
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It's nice to know how much time you have on your kindle and alerts you before your battery dies.  Too bad it didn't  flash an alert sooner though.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl puts together a masterpiece about the iconic Sound City recording studio that makes me wish that it was converted into a museum like Sun Studios instead of closing down. Having seen this documentary, I would have made the long trip to California for the primary purpose of visiting this historic studio. A particular treat is seeing musicians like Paul McCartney join Grohl for a recording session using the same equipment that shaped so much of modern music.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This s game can be challenging, it is a hood way to flex those brain muscles<br />Thanks go to the creators . I 're c dimensions game
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it. Lots of who done it around this mystery. Its one of those you just can't put it down cause the next chapter is gonna be better than the next.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This movie contains the all star action movie starrings, good screenplay, and nice action sequence!!! 100% recommended . . .
B000AJIF4E|4.0|This is a replacement pair for a 12 year old identical model.I had seen some negatives about the ear cups coming apart and such but this has not been the case with me.Overall,a really good set of headphones for monitoring.I primarily use these for digital recording software that I have so I will have them on for many hours at a time with very little fatigue.The sound is very good as well with regard to the highs and middles and lows.Bottom line is there are way better headphones out there but for the price range Id be hard pressed to find a better sounding headphone.
B00A8KJN14|3.0|I had to work at trying to like this film.  In the end, that chore proved too difficult and I came away unimpressed.  Eh.  It had a few fun moments.  Loved and bought the fantastic score by Danny Elfman.  Thought the dog was adorable (alive and dead-ish).  Loved the reference to Gamera.  Liked the boy (Victor Frankenstein as voiced by Charlie Tahan).  Thought his parents were lackluster to say the least, in fact, most of the characters were anemic, lost in the ho-hum attitude of the story.  In the end, I simply couldn't get past the lack of energy, that most of the characters were lethargic and uninteresting.  With the exception of the homage to Vincent Price (Mr. Rzykruski as voiced by Martin Landau), I found little to engage me where the characters were concerned.  Everything else was fine though.  Just not as spectacular as I had hoped.
037571457X|3.0|Was O.K. - I liked the story but the comic book approach left me cold.........did give some history of the issue that is somewhat unknown.
0374533555|1.0|the author does a great job of expanding about 5 pages of information into about 400 pages.  Neither my wife or I could get through more than the first ten pages or so without being bored to tears.  Basically, the author says that you can make some decisions quickly based on past experiences and knowledge and decisions in new area or requiring computation require more time.  Wish I had the money instead of the book, it was a gift to me and will be going to the library book sale.  might look impressive on a book shelf (after all the guy won a nobel prize).  Suggest the book \\"the brain that changes itself\\" (may not have the title exactly correct_ if you want to read a book about brain development.<br /><br />Like most books I have read by economists (other that Freakonomics) if you drop the book while reading and lose your place, I doubt you will be able to find it because you won't recognize or remember .anything you have read.  An analogy would be walking thru water and looking for the trail you made.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|I enjoyed the tale in this one on VHS. This one is for any fan of monsters movie or creep show.
1608871819|5.0|This was a great book to read through. The artwork is fantastic and it's really great seeing how close the final product came to the original concept art. There is a ton of background information that makes me appreciate the story and the movie so much more now.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I enjoy watching her music videos on TV. i was glad to get this one i have the CD with the same name.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have a kindle fire and enjoy the jigsaw puzzle. My kids also enjoy it too. Lots of pretty pictures. So far it is my favorite jigsaw app
B000002LGQ|5.0|I enjoyed her 80's 90's and now music. this one is a good one to get if you like her music.
B00AKKGX4W|1.0|I have not returned a book because I hated the story line so badly.  I couldn't finish it.  Writing, even for a romance was amateurism.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|I enjoyed his stuff since the 90's on a oldies radio stations. this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of his music.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|I liked the first three films with Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. they really pull off the movies really well. I honestly don't know if anyone could have pulled the acting ability as these two individuals. As far as the fourth film, I really like the female lead and her ability to pull off the part. I really like Pat Moirita in this movie as well.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was so pleased to have this book on my Kindle when I had moved and had no books on hand.<br /><br />Nobody has made me more interested in the country of Afghanistan than this author. I am fascinated by the culture and by the history he has made so immediate and so real that I can see, feel, smell, and experience it in every one of his books.<br /><br />Truly, a wonderful read. I do recommend all his books. And I hope there will be more.
B00A7MSHHO|2.0|PROS: EXCELLENT sculpt and paint apps.  Very detailed -- things likes tread patterns on the sole of his boots, different gadgets and canisters on his belt (even a Bat cell phone), and a carbon-fiber looking pattern on some of the armor pieces.  Face sculpt is terrific as well.  Overall, great-looking figure.  5 stars just on the sculpt and paint.<br /><br />Articulation is also excellent, and does not detract from the look of the sculpt.  Batman's armored looks makes most of the joints look fairly seamless, with the possible exception of the hip joints.  HOWEVER, see more below on the joint quality.<br /><br />Also includes a decent amount of extra accessories, such as extra hands, grapple gun, EMP rifle, and a display stand.<br /><br />CONS: Unfortunately, the joints are WAY, way too loose.  The shoulders, which are on ball joints, pop out at the slightest movement.  They can be put back in easily enough, but one would expect a figure to develop this kind of looseness after lots of handling, not fresh from the box.  Also the toe joint needs to be more stiff so that the figure doesn't fall over.  In fact, Batman cannot stand at all, unless he is attached to his display base.  Sure, you can probably fix all the joint looseness with some clear nail polish or super glue, but you shouldn't have to do that with a new figure.<br /><br />Although articulation is great, the poor joint quality pretty much negates this since it can't keep a lot of poses due to the lack of friction and appendages popping out.  And he's useless without his stand.<br /><br />It's a great-looking figure, but the looseness of the joints makes this a major disappointment.  If I had the chance, I would not buy the figure again.
B008I15774|5.0|This boxed set is, very simply put, worth every penny if just to have the 2012 remastering of Schuricht's very excellent Vienna recording of Bruckner's 3rd Symphony.  A side-by-side comparison with EMI's previous release the 1965 recording reveals a HUGE difference not only in expanded dynamic range but of acoustical depth and surrounding.  Speaking from experience, you quite honestly feel like you're sitting perhaps 15-20 rows back in the orchestra section in the Gro&szlig;er Saal of Vienna's Musikverein where the recording was made.  It's wonderful!  As to the Beethoven Symphonies, they're wonderful too!  The stereo 9th is a very underrated recording and has never sounded better.  Schuricht's justly famous Vienna recordings of Bruckner's 8th and 9th Symphonies were recently released in a two-CD set in hybrid SACD format.  That remastering is presented here although not in SACD.  It really doesn't matter much as you will be thrilled by the sound!  Excellent all around!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wow. I absolutely loved this book. It's my first time reading Hosseini and now I'm kicking myself for not reading The Kite Runner sooner. There is something so tranquil about the style and tone of his writing despite the heartbreaking situations his characters are going through. There are so many tragedies told with such honesty in such a peaceful cadence that you can't help drifting from one word to the next, one broken life tethered to the next. I had a hard time putting the book down. And even when I did, the words and characters and circumstances would float through my mind, pulling me back in.<br /><br />The story is told by multiple narrators and there was a bit of a ripple in the peaceful waters as I searched for the string that tied each narrative to the next, but I was eager and anxious and excited to find that string and see what new facet of these lives would be revealed.<br /><br />It was a beautiful, heartbreaking, honest novel. And I admit to getting a bit teary in the end. It was a quite a journey to take with these characters, but I would do it all over again. This is definitely on my to-be-read-again shelf.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better, and with this book, this is truly the best one yet...i read this in 2 days!
1439153663|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas and after she read the book, she insisted I HAD TO READS IT!!  From page one of this book I was captivated.  I LOVE historical fiction books and this one proved to be my new MOST favorite book of all times.  It keeps you glued to the pages and causes you to neglect other household duties so you can get back to reading it.<br />Anyone looking for a spellbinding book should not look any farther than Kitchen House.  I hope the author will pen a continuation of the story to show what happened with the characters in the years after this story concluded.

B004I654WQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Pixar movies. It's basically about a self-centered car getting stuck in an obsolete town. Not only does he find himself, he finds friendship with the town that lasts a lifetime. I love the background of Radiator Springs and the some of the racing scenes seem like you're actually watching a Nascar race. Now that my son loves this movie, everything is about Cars!! I bought this for him and he loves it!<br /><br />The actual DVD/Blu-Ray I received was damaged but Amazon took care of it and it has no reflection on the movie itself.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This app WILL let you highlight, annotate, and otherwise mark up your documents, but it does not reliably save your changes.  Twice I have had this happen with important notes and once with an unimportant document that I used as a test.  Reinstalling did not make a difference.<br /><br />I read a LOT of documents and I needed something that would allow me to take notes.  I need to come back and access the marked up document.  It crashes too often, and in the cases that it doesn't save things it doesn't warn you of issues.  I came back to open the document and it told me that I could access a recovered version.  When I opened the recovered versions, none had all the notes I entered, despite saving diligently while working and at the end.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a way to mark up your documents, look elsewhere.  If there's a risk that you will start losing your notes, like me, it's not worth it.

B003L77GG0|4.0|The &#34;bad guys&#34; of this season felt a little overdone to me, mostly because the main one is not really seen in any meaningful way, it's just always there in the background. With that said, this season was a very satisfying conclusion to the Smallville saga, with just enough of the &#34;old&#34; Clark Kent from Season 1 and just enough of the &#34;new&#34; Clark Kent and his friends that we've seen in the ensuing seasons to keep fans familiar with the feel of the storytelling while adding a new dimension to the Superman mythology.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|2009's Star Trek was one of those films that defied expectations. It was so good, so entertaining, so full of great character moments, that it was almost effortless in its ability to entertain. At the time, I stated that there was maybe one scene in which I would go out for popcorn. Unfortunately, this film has many such scenes. It's never a good sign for me when you come out of a film entertained on the surface level, yet most of what you remember about it is the things that you didn't like. Were there problems with the first 2009's Trek? You betcha! But its heart was in the right place and it learned to respect the Trek.<br />  The main thing that can be determined with a degree of certitude concerning this Star Trek film is that the film's director, J.J. Abrams is wholly capable to direct the next Star Wars film. There's so much wiz bang action and Stuff! Stuff!! Stuff!!! flying at you that during one point in the film, while two small ships were weaving through the buildings of a cityscape, my wife turned to me and said, \\"No, that looks nothing at all like Star Wars.\\"<br />  And that may be this film's biggest problem. It's so action oriented, that this film series has veered away from anything that resembles what could be defined as Star Trek. It seems that in the effort to broaden the appeal of Star Trek, the studio and the film's creative team are content to transform Trek into something it never was and probably never meant to be. It is now a summer tent-pole actioner which is almost indistinguishable from the other types of science fiction adventure films out there.<br />  In the 23rd century...<br />  Some time has passed for our heroes. Since the end of the first film, the U.S.S. Enterprise has been on several adventures. And in the classic tradition of the opening teaser that was so prevalent in all the Star Trek television shows, this film opens right in the middle of one of these adventures. While on a mission to a strange new world, and assigned to seek out, but simply observe, new life and new civilizations (here in the form of a primitive culture), Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his Chief Medical Officer, and best friend, Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) decided it would be more exciting to be seen by these primitive aliens and now are on the run from a group of them. At the same time Vulcan First Officer, and Kirk's other best friend, Spock (Zachary Quinto), is in the middle of a local active volcano in an effort to prevent it from erupting and destroying that very same primitive civilization.<br />  Unfortunately, in an effort to save Spock from the violent vulnerabilities of volcanic vaporization, Kirk allows the Enterprise to be seen by the primitive culture. Kirk is ordered back to Starfleet Headquarters, is promptly demoted and loses command of the Enterprise. Spock, for his part, thanks his captain with heartfelt admonishments of, \\"You have violated the Prime Directive,\\" while never having a true understanding of why Kirk had to save him. (For those not in the know, the Prime Directive is THE supreme law of the United Federation of Planets, and is basically a directive to not interfere in the natural developement of other cultures. [For those not in the know, the Federation is a collection of worlds that have come together to form a large democratic governmental body, living in peace and harmony, and is protected and explored by Starfleet. {For those not in the know, Starfleet is... Man! One could do this all day! }])<br />  Meanwhile, a bigger threat is looming as a currently disgruntled former Starfleet agent by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), has vowed to unleash terroristic revenge against the Federation and begins by bombing a records facility in London. Then, he boldly attacks Starfleet Command itself, before escaping into hiding on the Klingon homeworld Kronos.<br />  Kirk is quickly (and I mean quickly) given back his command and ordered by Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) to take the Enterprise to the edge of Klingon space with seventy-two specialized photon torpedoes, with orders to launch them into Kronos and take out Harrison, even though it will certainly cause a war to erupt between the Federation and the Klingons. Now Kirk must wrestle with the dilemma of killing a Federation Citizen who hasn't even stood trial for his crimes as well as the uncomfortable rift between him and Spock.<br />  After the much and deservedly loved reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009, naturally there were going to be high expectations to come with this second adventure of our beloved crew. With that film, the filmmakers progressed through the lengthy introductions of the characters and their world, as well as creating a clean slate to create new stories without the cumbersome baggage of the forty-six years of lore that had come before.<br />  Here, J.J. Abrams again crafts a yet another breezy adventure that transports the viewer from on set piece to another. His hand is more assured and comfortable in navigating this new Trek world that he's established. Of note is an entertaining teaser and some genuinely awe inspiring moments involving the Starship Enterprise. He's come up with a more interesting villain than 2009's Romulan, Nero, as well as a palpable sense of unease as the Federation itself comes under threat. In short, we fly through the film and leave without the feeling that we've just sat through a two hour film, a tribute to the talent of Abrams.<br />  The film's cast also has an easier time with this outing. After 2009's Trek, having imparted the characters with their own personal stamps, the actors are now free to come out from under the very long shadows of the original cast and free to mold these people any way they like, limited only by the personality types that the characters are. In other words, the roots are the same, but the sprouting plants will differ.<br />  So, no longer is it Chris Pine's interpretation of William Shatner's James T. Kirk, It is now Chris Pine's Kirk. And with this new freedom, it's a very different Kirk indeed. Pine expands on the brashness that he established for the character, starting out as a Captain who has \\"no humility\\", \\"doesn't respect the chair\\", and is \\"relying on blind luck\\" for his success. Pine begins with that brashness, then capably bring his character to a more mature place as the seriousness of events start to pile on and he learns of the weight that command must place on him.<br />  Zachary Quinto's Spock is never better. He starts out as a person who is so clinging to logic and non-emotion that he really doesn't understand the depths of loyalty and friendship until the seriousness of events start to pile on and he learns of the weight that relationships with humans must place on him. But in the end, the question is, \\"Is he choosing not to feel or hiding from his emotions.\\" The answer will surprise him (but probably not the audience). Quinto, as an actor has quickly mastered the ability to balance a performance of suppressing his emotions, yet infuses the character with a dry charm to keep his Spock an engaging and likable character.<br />  Of the rest of the cast, Zoe Saldena's Uhura, is again given the most to do and is allowed to share in the adventure in a way that Nichelle Nichol's Uhura from the original series would have dreamed for. But the truth of the matter is that Saldena has less of an opportunity to shine than in the previous film, and that may be in part to the lack of scenes in which she is allowed to be a real person, instead of someone participating in the action. Still she is just as confident and professional as she was in the first outing, but never more than that.<br />  And what can be said of Karl Urban's McCoy? McCoy used to be a vital part Star Trek, being the emotional voice, there to counterbalance Spock's logic and show Kirk the humanity of the situation, so that he can fulfill his role in what course of action must be taken. It was the Kirk, Spock, and McCoy triad and the heart of Classic Star Trek. Unfortunately here, he suffers the same fate as Uhura. And while Urban has definitely gotten his portrayal of McCoy down, he's more there to sound off with a sarcastic quip. \\"Dammit, Jim! It's not Star Trek unless I can spout a McCoyism!\\" This will be most jarring to long time Trek fans, but even if we take the film on its own, Urban has a character who's been given less to do.<br />  The chief problems of the film lie with its writing, or because of the film's preoccupation with action spectacle, the lack of it. The characters get lost because they are people in a film so overwhelmed with action that they aren't allowed to let the relationships to each other or their humanity shine through.<br />  Benedict Cumberbatch's villain, John Harrison, could have been a great one. From the moment he's onscreen, you are drawn in, compelled by the sheer strength of his catlike magnetism to watch his every move. Cumberbatch brings an elegantly graceful menace that contains a suppressed strength ready to lash out. And though the film attempts to bring a logical motivation to his actions, he's fleshed out as a character through people talking about him and the always obligatory monologue scene where he tells our heroes how the world \\"done him wrong\\", rather than spending time with him and letting him show us who he is. Cumberbatch creates a performance that owes much more to the actor than to the material he was given.<br />  The chief illustration of the film's writing problems, though, is found in the relationship between the two leads. Kirk and Spock (and should have been McCoy) are two people that are joined at the hip, in a bond of friendship so strong that they would die for each other. But in the first film, their relationship consisted of spending most of their time at odds with each other, and only beginning to form their friendship towards the end of the film. Most of Into Darkness is spent with them again at odds because Spock's by-the-book attitudes cannot enable him to understand why Kirk risked his life and career by breaking the Prime Directive in order to save Spock's life at the beginning of the film. As a result, their bonding as friends has taken place between the two films. So, when the big emotional payoff scenes hit, they ring hollow because the audience has not shared in that relationship.<br />  Other problems are that the film has many plot holes that go unanswered (hence being holes). One wonders about the logic in which Harrison has come about his wrath. One wonders about the few people who are able take so many questionable actions, that it begs the question, \\"Are they working in a vacuum where higher authorities play no part?\\" One wonders how these can occur without resulting in major investigations and our heroes questioning their very beliefs?<br />  By the end of the film, no one cares. We've been given a breezy, yet almost hollow, two plus hours of entertainment, with lots and lots and lots of action, some interesting and some just pedestrian (\\"What's this flying platform for?\\" \\"So we can have a fistfight on it.\\"). And in the end everyone prepares to boldly go where this Star Trek has never gone before, to a galaxy far far away...

B0058YPGSY|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is the best TV series ever, and this season was no let down. Do yourself a favor dont watch the weekly episodes and just buy the season when it comes out. Kurt Sutter the writter is a master at leaving you emotionally fried until the next week.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|The excitement of creation without cost or consequence is a compelling notion.  The ability to make something that never existed is exciting but the forces of chaos will always counterbalance.  Can humanity survive the democratization of everything?
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I've played this game, all the way to the end, then uninstalled it.  Why did I uninstall it?  Because I couldn't stop playing it!  Then... the longing became too much.  I had to re-install it and play it again.  And again.<br /><br />This game has all the great elements that a mobile game should.  Quick individual plays, but a compelling story to keep you coming back for more.  It's not heavy on graphics or sound, but there are plenty of elements in the game that keep you absorbed: fast action, random enemies and item drops, a plethora of upgrades (and none of them require you paying more $$$!).<br /><br />I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles or real-time action RPGs.  Even if you only like one but not the other!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for a while.<br />My daughter never watched before (only in commercials)<br />The movie is in perfect condition, we have watched about 10 times since the day we got it.
B00CW665VI|3.0|Okay, so I purchased this book for $4.99 because I read so many good reviews on it. I can see how some people would give this a 5 star but, for me, that's not the case. I didn't HATE it. I finished it after all and there were some good parts but the way that Drew is talking to YOU got really frustrating.*spoilers?* And the things he did to get her back were beyond cheesy. Kind of made him seem like a serious stalker. It was very predictable and anti climatic. I have to give Emma Chase some credit,though, for thinking outside the box and doing something unique. It was very unique. And like I said some people, I'm sure will love this book, but it's one of those find out for yourself situations. HAPPY READING :)
B004NS710C|5.0|Big Denzel fan, and as he gets older I think he just gets better! Well worth the sale price if you ask me!
0307341577|5.0|Before picking up this book, I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and was totally blown away by the plot and characters! This one talks about a family murder and finding out who is behind these murders. Once again, the usual elements of Gillian Flynn are present: funny, wickedly entertaining and twisted plot, as well as characters who are very human in their own way.<br />Five thumbs up for it!

B00D6BN9NK|2.0|This was the lamest action movie I have seen in a long time.  It just was loud explosions, etc. but no substance.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another great one by Stephen King.  Amazing story telling.  Unforgettable characters.  It was not what, I expected. If you like his books pick this one up.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Between Bruno's group's singing and Bruno's easy sense of humor, you've got a winner! Can't get enough of him and anxiously await a new album.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Excellent movie, with well-chosen cast members.  Recommend it for all ages.  Perhaps, it should be required for students when studying the Civil War Era.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I thought ... honestly, it's not as good as the other angry birds games. I was actually disappointed.it's still pretty good though.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie.  A movie, music or play can relate the SAME message without using all the filthy language.  Just because people use this language in real life doesn't mean it has to be perpetuated is all the stories we tell.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought this app was way better than temple run, and temple run brave. It is so cool, and way to good to be free! Minion dash is also<br /> &ordf; great game for younger children.
0425267695|5.0|Do you know the overwhelming feeling when reading such a good book (like from Rothfuss or Sanderson) that it is just impossible to put it down. Trying to concentrate at work is just impossible, since - all you keep doing is pondering on the story line? Well forget about doing anything else important after starting to read this book - it's just too good. After finishing you'll probably consider re-reading it, since parting from the world the book creates feels like such a loss. Can't wait for the sequel!<br /><br />Thanks for writing such an excellent book and greetings from Finland,<br />Chris

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Say what you will about how readers might not like this book because they wanted a \\"fairy-tale ending\\", or because they don't \\"get\\" how profound it was; the fact of the matter is, this book is objectively bad. Not bad as in evil, but bad as in exhibiting poor craftsmanship. The storytelling is ineffective, incoherent and nonsensical.  The conflicts are contrived, the characters are soulless and Katniss' motivation becomes overpowered by the author's need to wrap up the rebellion.<br /><br />In the end Katniss' character is on the receiving end of the most horrific assassinations in the book. Throughout the last 2/3rds of the book she is reacting in a numb, zombie-like state as the events of the world close in around her. She has no clear motive, her self-sacrifice at the beginning of the Hunger Games turns into a muddled and confused array of reactions and rash decisions. Good authors give the lead character a choice in which there are two equally compelling options. In the end of this book, Katniss generally either has no choice or the ones that she makes are obvious.<br /><br />Like a previous reviewer said, I did indeed want to see Katniss infiltrate the capital and take Snow down. But that didn't happen. I am really okay with that not happening. I like the gritty realism that the author was going for. However, nothing Katniss does contributes very strongly to how things turn out. Snow was practically brought to her on a silver platter after someone (once again) rescued her from near death. She is the worst heroine in history. Everything she does fails and the only reason she survives in the end is because of the help of other people. The other characters keep talking about how powerful she is and in the end she is the most useless part of the rebellion. I'm not exaggerating when I say the author couldn't have made a worse ending if she would have had Katniss accidentally blowing up Snow by tripping over her own bomb-rigged shoelaces. That is not a spoiler, by the way, but a much more entertaining version of how the book ends. Some call this feminist friendly, but I would say that if you think feminism means that women can't do anything right, always make stupid decisions and that mothers can be so callous as to just abandon a child having gone through serious trauma (Katniss' mother doesn't even visit her after the rebellion is over, she's like \\"call me when you get out of solitary confinement - toodles!\\"), then it is feminist friendly. I have a different view of feminism, so I disagree.<br /><br />The worst part is when some no-name character becomes the new president. What was all this build up for, so someone for which the reader cannot possibly have any sympathy can take over? I mean really, there was no character from the first two books that could have not died and stepped up to be the new president? There were three questions that I wanted answered, three questions which led me to read non-stop through the entire series. One of them was not when, but how Katniss would overtake Snow. Okay, so she does, kinda, but I really think tripping over her shoelaces would have legitimately been way better. The second was Gale or Peeta. Okay and she chooses Peeta because as it turns out Gale, like Katniss, is a little bit of a hot-head. Gale was like, \\"mighta bombed your sister, whoopsie-doodle\\". Okay he didn't say that, but he might as well have because the actual conversation between Gale and Katniss in the book was way more superficial and pointless. Well, that was kinda lame, and again doesn't really give Katniss much of a choice. I guess the author might have picked up on the fact that it takes more than bread-making savvy and cake decorating wizardry to create a convincing teen heartthrob, so she just tried to even the playing field a bit. And you know what, I'm still not convinced that Pete was the right choice considering his homicidal tendencies but I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. The third thing that keptme reading was who would take over when the rebellion ended. Coin was shady from the start, I knew that. You wanted to know that the rebellion wouldn't end in leadership worse than Snow. And so Katniss' decision to vote for the next wave of Hunger Games then shoot Coin was actually pretty decent. However, who was that no-name looser they elected for the new president? There are no words to describe the antipathy I have for that resolution. I felt robbed.<br /><br /> Okay, so people don't write long-winded rants about books that are completely bad. I am upset because the elements for a great book were all there. But the fact of the matter is, while I rooted for the characters in the first two books of the trilogy, in this one I found myself rooting for the Mutts so the book could be over and the characters would stop annoying me. I was even glad to see Prim go because she didn't do anything but act helpless. And don't get me started on her stupid cat buttermilk or whatever its name was. Why were whole minutes of my life taken from me by reading about that stupid cat with its stupid attitude? I think this book was rushed and that the author could have done much better with rewrites and even remotely competent editors. Stay away from this one if you can. But if you are like me and cannot resist reading because of the first two, be prepared for a let-down.me reading was who would take over when the rebellion ended.

140006922X|4.0|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by an Associate Professor of Creative Writing at the University of California, Reza Aslan is a vividly written book. Not burdened by tedious polemics or by too many lengthy quotes from Greek, Aramaic or Hebrew sources, the book is an easy reading on par with a well researched historical novel. It has the potential to kindle the imagination of the reader interested in the story of the `real Jesus'.<br /><br />The book is less of a godsend for a reader who expected an original research about Jesus `the Zealot'. The argument itself is not new. But it could have been further enriched if Reza Aslan would provide wider background on Zealots - the Liberation Movement going back to the times of Maccabees.<br />It is understood and accepted that Reza Aslan had no choice but to rely on others to read Aramaic and Hebrew sources. However, there is no excuse in converting the Aramaic Yeshu bar Mariam into ridiculously sounding English Jesus bar Mary spoiling the authenticity of the story. It is unacceptable to bring forward the ancient canard of Yehoshua ben Panthera without explaining that it was maliciously corrupted Greek expression Yisus yos Parthenos, or Jesus son of a Virgin.<br /><br />Author provides an impressive list of sources which he used in his twenty years long research. But the list doesn't include the Talmuds (both Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi, were translated into English) - an important research source about Zealots. Such research is indescribably more complicated but it was done in the past.<br /><br />Here is the list of books where the reader could find much more about the `real Jesus'. The books are rare, but worth the effort of getting them:<br /><br />a) \\"Jesus of Nazareth. His life, Times and Teaching\\" by Joseph Klausner of Hebrew Univeristy. The book was written in 1922 and is, in my opinion, among the most comprehensive books about the 'real Jesus'.<br /><br />b) \\"The Trial and Death of Jesus\\" by ChiefJustice of Israel Haim Cohn. It was first presented in 1967 in Hebrew University as series of lectures. Deeply proficient in Jewish and Roman Law, Chef Justice Cohn presented the legal aspects of the Jesus story as described in Gospels and explained how tragically incorrect were the conclusions drawn by the Church.<br /><br />c) Josephus Trilogy by Lion Feuchtwanger. Three historical novels about the life of Josephus Flavius.

It is more of a interesting and serious take on the original version since Bruce Campbell is not starring in this one and I am ok with that since this is a remake after all. Anyways, if you are a evil dead freak like me then you know you have to buy this because come on, you have have to admit it was somewhat entertaining to watch and I was glad that he movie was not toned down to PG-13 or whatever because I thought it was going to end up like that but thankfully I was wrong.

B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I pre-ordered the album and it came with the MP3 album as well which has bonus tracks and since it started downloading last night on amazon cloud player i have been jammin' to it all day. it is full of songs to get you up and moving. The album is very addictive and fun.<br /><br />first off, obviously the lyrics are not the most amazing in the world, this album is basically just to have fun. SO, with that said, heres my opinion of how good the songs are and a little comment on them as well. although most you'll notice will say they are good for dancing....<br /><br />1. Birthday (8/10)- This song is fun and i can picture someone whos maybe a little tipsy at a club dancing around just having fun.<br /><br />2. Slow Down (9/10)- This song is very addictive, it gets stuck in your head very easily and is great for dancing to.<br /><br />3. Stars Dance (10/10) - Theres something about this song that i love, i dont know why, but it just makes me want to close my eyes and let the music fill me. Its not one of the more fast, dance tunes, its a slower semi-sexy tune if you really listen.<br /><br />4. Like A champion (4/10) - This is my least favorite song on the album. Its just really annoying to me hearing Selena try to have a Jamaican accent...REALLY ANNOYING.<br /><br />5. Come & Get It (10/10) - This is definitely the most addicting song on the album. The song is very smooth and and sexy. One of the slower songs.<br /><br />6. Forget Forever (6/10) - Its a fun little song to dance to but nothing special. nothing really sticks in your head like some of the others. And at some parts her voice is a little annoying, you'll know what i mean if you listen to it.<br /><br />7. Save The Day (10/10) - Great song to dance to, good beat. Easy to get addicted to.<br /><br />8. B.E.A.T. (9/10) - This song really reminds me of DEV. Its a good song to dance to.<br /><br />9. Write Your Name (8/10) - Good slower dance song. interesting beat, very smooth.<br /><br />10. Undercover (9/10) - Very good for dancing, very addicting.<br /><br />11. Love Will Remember (9/10) - This is a slower song but the lyrics are much better than most of the others, more meaningful.<br /><br />MP3 ALBUM BONUS TRACKS:<br /><br />12. Nobody Does It Like You (7/10) - Itd be an 8 if it didnt have \\"swagger\\" in it hahaha im sorry but i cant take it seriously with that word in it. its alright for dancing but theres nothing too special about it.<br /><br />13. Music Feels Better (8/10) - a fun dance song. lyrics arent much at all and reminds me of another song that i cant for the life of me think of who sings it and the name but it also says \\"the music feels better with you\\".<br /><br />14. Come & Get It (DJ Lazslo Club Mix) (9/10) - Very good remix of the original but theres a few others on Selenas youtube page that are much better. This remix makes Come & Get it much more danceable to and and interesting twist on the original. I like hearing the different remixes of songs, its great for when you get tired of hearing the original being played 24/7 on the radio but still love the song and want something a little different.<br /><br />annndddd thats the end of that. i definitely think its worth it to get the album. the majority of it is good dance music which is perfect for me while driving and whatnot. if youre looking for songs with more meaning and emotion, this is NOT the album for you! This is just mainly just for having fun and dancing.) - Very good for dancing, very addicting.<br /><br />11.

B00BWJARHO|1.0|It's like Jackson is beginning to believe that he wrote the middle earth sagas himself, his brush swings so wide from the original arc. This is probably the worst adaptation I have seen this year. If you boil the problems with this film down to one salient kernel, it would have to be Jackson's misguided urge to take what was a quietly humorous quest and turn it into some kind of Hugh Jackman action film. That is the only reason I can see for Jackson making so many goofy additions to the film, like his dumb sequences of Radagast the Brown driving ... awk! ... a sleigh propelled by RABBITS. Give me a break. Or all of the howling orcs that appear during the original troll sequence, as if the trolls couldn't carry their own weight. Or the appearance of Saruman and Galadriel in Rivendell, when they obviously don't appear until the Fellowship of the Ring. Perhaps Jackson felt that adding these characters to his work would create more continuity ... but that is precisely the problem. Continuity between what? The original works as they were presented by Tolkien were seamless; they did not need additional effects or extra boosts of continuity. The only plausible answer, then, is that Jackson reckoned they would add continuity between his films, and therein lies his arrogance ... or his stupidity. While I liked Jackson's efforts in The Lord of the Rings well enough -- minus the xenophobic racialization of all his monsters, orcs, Haradrim, etc. -- he has clearly become obsessed with his image of himself as some kind of genius whose &#34;vision&#34; of a masterwork like Tolkien's justifies any cinematic nuance he sees fit to slam into the script. Unfortunately, so many of these &#34;additions&#34; involve scenes that are either hackneyed beyond belief (the dragon opening its eye at the end of the first film) or just completely DUMB (Radagast and his rabbit-mobile) that he has turned his effort at The Hobbit into something as mundane as Iron Man or Catwoman. Maybe even worse.

I like how they'd created the Giants and the voice acting done. The General of the Giants has a cool Irish accent. Super battle scenes. Good soundtrack.

159463176X|3.0|When I first began to read this book that I had been looking forward to for so long, I told everyone I knew what an amazing storyteller this author is and I had such high expectations of it continuing to be another great book by one of my favorite authors. I actually loved the beginning so much that I re-read some of the sections because they were so beautiful. In fact, many brought tears to my eyes. All of a sudden, the book took a DRASTIC downturn once he began the next section where he began to develop the story about Pari's adoptive parents, Nabi and Mr. Wahdati.<br /><br />It got even worse once he began the story about Markos and Greece since I didn't care about those characters at all. The writing style of the rest of the book changed drastically and was not as heartfelt and meaningful as his usual writing. I do not want to give away the plot but I was expecting to read more about Abdullah and Pari's lives and hated the way the story rambled on and veered away from them and went in a totally different direction. We only got back to the original characters at the very end and the entire middle section of the book was terrible. There was too much focus on unnecessary characters. It was also hard to keep track of the way he was jumping around between the characters and decades too. I really did not even want to finish the book but I kept thinking I would miss something considering how wonderful the beginning was and how much I loved his first 2 books.<br /><br />If anyone reading this review has not read his 2 previous books, read them now because they were fabulous. This could have been another truly spectacular book but it left me very frustrated. I would not recommend this book at all since it was a great disappointment after his 2 other remarkable books.
0307887448|5.0|This was so enjoyable, truly an entertaining book that was off the hook clever and rad! Growing up in the eighties, I was able to completely connect and appreciate all the 80's pop culture references as if my childhood memories were unfolding in front of me. That, compared with the other science-fiction, fantasy story-line and race to save the universe made it engaging and interesting the whole way through. This is one of my favorite books ever and sure to be a cult-classic!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story had all of the twists and turns expected of a great who-done-it and therein was my problem. Not a problem with the book, but with me, its reader. I got confused. By not paying careful enough attention to the plot and the cast of characters, I ended up missing key connections that would have tied the story together for me. I was too relaxed on vacation to give this book the focus it deserved. Maybe it should be read in winter.......
0307595862|5.0|I've read nearly all Mankell mysteries, several from Arnaldur Indridasen, and a few other less good Scandinavian writers. Nesbø (pronounced more like Nesbeu in French, not Nesbo) is different than Mankell but just as good. That is, the emphasis is on psycho-sociological aspects of the players. The main player Harry Hole (why do Nesbø's players have such non-Norwegian names?) is in some respects in worse shape in life than Mankell's Commissar Wallendar.<br /><br />This review is based on the Norwegian original, Snømannen.

The other professional dancers in this film deserve lots of credit too.  The scene of Sally dancing consecutively with three male partners is AMAZING !!!!  You can find clips on YouTube, which is how I discovered this fabulous film.<br /><br />This is one of my most prized films in my collection.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This sound from Justin Timberlake is very old school feel-y and something mellow to listen to while still having an updated subtle sex appeal to the sound and lyrics.
B008JFUS0U|5.0|Love the movie. Very action packed. Thor kicks butt. Odin plays a very good role. I reccomend this movie. 5 stars
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thought it was going to be a predictable book by title but i was wrong was a good read! recommend to somebody looking for a good book about romance.
B008JFUS0U|5.0|Love the movie. Very action packed. Thor kicks butt. Odin plays a very good role. I reccomend this movie. 5 stars
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I recommended to any one looking for a really really good read,was recommended to me by a friend and I fell in love with all three books! I am a sucker for action and romance all in one book!
1587143879|5.0|These are some very well written books. I originally had the set for the 640-802 test. I have noticed some really good differences in these new ones.<br /><br />-Thorough getting started section<br />-Addition of IPv6 material is going to be a good foundation for network professionals moving forward<br />-OSPF is now referred to as OSPFv2, this is because of the addition to the much needed sections on OSPFv3 for IPv6<br />-Includes some excellent configuration examples with a comparison between the IPv4 and IPv6 way of doing things<br />-FHRP's (First Hop Redundancy Protocols) are included i.e. HSRP, VRRP; this is awesome considering you will probably deal with this prior to reaching your CCNP studies<br />-Implementing OSPF and EIGRP for IPv6 are excellent chapters considering that most people will be doing this soon if they haven't already<br />-Sections on IOS licensing help understand how the products are working in the real world and where Cisco is going<br />-Inclusion of NetFlow, SNMP, and Syslogs was also a very needed addition, these are also things many will see long before their CCNP studies<br />-Mind maps are awesome!<br /><br />All in all these books have gone through some much needed updating and now include much more detail into what network professionals will see on a daily basis. Candidates will be better prepared for live networks or to implement their own after having gone through these books.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I waited so long to read this! It was again another amazing book!!! a definite must read all her books!
B0063M22QO|2.0|I don't like the set up of the tiles. There is a grid on the page that I find annoying. I do like the reshuffle.<br />Overall the game is poor. I probably will buy a new mahjong game to replace this one.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun to play when I'm bored. Sometimes difficult to tap exactly what I'm after. Overall good fun! Can't wait to level up.
1401322425|1.0|I had read good reviews but was disappointed. The book came bent and damaged. There are scratches. It should have been packed in cardboard but was in a soft package. Fortunately I did not spend a lot on this purchase. It probably will cost as much to ship it back. I will not use this seller again. There are creases in at least 30 pages in a row. I am very disappointed. I like supporting independent sellers but will not use you again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Coolest game ever I've never played a game like  it.<br />You have to play it is better than temple run.
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie because I ran out of things to watch. Lawrence...is a serious actress. She made the movie non-hokie. Other than that it was very entertaining. Very good action adventure cinema.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It's almost just like Diablo, but you have to wait 2hrs for potions to be restored, use cash to get most of the stores weapons and power ups, but you can find and upgrade stuff and still be ok without spending money xD all in all still worth playing and you'll have a blast even if you don't pay.
B000001FI7|4.0|I'm new to this genre, but I found most of the album to be quite novel. The vocalist has quite the stylistic range, and there are some great sounds here including Sour Times and Glory Box. Unfortunately not all the tracks are that caliber. Definitely happy with the purchase though.
0811874192|5.0|A dear friend is in the hospital and cannot have fresh flowers.<br /> I remembered seeing this book in a museum gift shop and found it here. It<br />has brought her so much pleasure. The art work is so well done. I purchased two more<br />as another hospital bouquet and then just a gift for a friend's birthday of flowers that would last!
B000002H5I|5.0|The album is about her life growing up facing racism and dealing with poverty and a broken home. The music is stylistically unique in my experience and enhances the weight of the lyrics. Not a weak song here.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Having looked at the SNK809 and the SNZG15 for months before deciding to buy the SNK809, I must say I'm really happy I did.<br />Initally, I was in love with the SNZG15 until I realized how large it is. Wearing a large watch is easy to bang and scratch during everyday wear. The SNK809 is smaller, lighter and has a very classic look. I'm very impressed how stylish it is for a watch to wear every day, going to work, and working in the yard. I'm very happy with it
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I've just played it a couple of times, but so far i like the app a lot. It's quite colorful and it keeps me occupied between appointmennts, while waiting in line, or while traveling. I alternate between this and Words With Friends and Candy Swipe. All are very enjoyable.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app  is just great for me. It gives me all different options and it really easy to use. So easy to change the place you want to check.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really worth having. Great at reminding one to plug in and to see how much time you have till next charge.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great CD to pick you up in the morning on your way to work. Fun to sing along. Great gift for Mom as well. She also loved it.
0525425772|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, and I think the Kid Lawyer books are great.  This one shows a boy with tough decisions to make, and he chooses rightly.  He is too good to be true, yet I hope there are lots of boys like him out there, reading this one.  Grisham's book always have a moral mesage and this one is clear from the beginning.  I look forward to the next Theo mystery.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is amazing for the kids on trips, or when they are bored on school breaks. its even fun for the older ones.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is the full version its great, i have full acces. The download was free. Thanks amazon. This is my first comentary
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I love all these actors, but it still isn't worth your time. The plot is terrible. The writing is terrible. The whole thing is just bad.
B002PMC8ME|5.0|I had to download this to my phone.  Classic old school album.  Top ten album of any genre of all time.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|If you read the top 3 ratings the first two complain about how little the tutorial shows you and the 3rd complains that they are not able to beat Al on the easiest level and is confused how strategy comes into play.<br /><br />I am here to tell you that this game has everything to do with strategy and the tutorial is just fine if you look at the tutorial it shows you different kinds of meteors and some other things and how they help and not and that there are stars and how you need to capture as many within the time limit using your fleet  and upgrades you can get by leveling up. It is possible to beat Al but you just need to know how to get many a fleet in the stars that can be attacked by Al and the stars that cant be attacked  should be feeding to the stars that can be attacked, using your fleet you should send your fleet to one of Al's stars until the fleet in your stars reach 25 then stop and you should gain control but this tactic works if you use it right.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love Minion Rush. It is so much fun. It is like Temple Run and Subway Suffers combined; but better than both apps. It is addicting and challenging. Be careful; there are in-game purchases using real money. This app does glitch a lot; force closes; and froze up my Kindle Fire twice. Once; I couldn't shut it down. I had to contact Amazon to get help. The other time; I could shut it down. Because of these problems; even though it is a great app; download at your own risk.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is cool its very helpful in telling me when my kindle is at 100% before it overcharges or vise versa when my kindle needs be charged before it shuts off in the middle of something important. The only downside to this app is the ads but that doesn't realm matter to me so its still five stars!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is sad, but happy at the same time. This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. If you are looking for an amazing book, Wonder is perfect for you.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Quentin Tarantino, in his latest effort to make a movie about movies, has crossed the spaghetti Western with blaxploitation and come up with \\"Django Unchained\\". In ante-bellum Texas, German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) attempts with much fanfare to purchase a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He needs Django's help in identifying a pair of outlaw brothers that he intends to kill for the reward and will give Django his freedom in return. Django proves to be a talented apprentice bounty hunter, and he intends to employ those skills in tracking down his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) once winter has passed. Broomhilda was sold to Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio), a sadistic bon vivant who owns the biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi. Schultz comes up with a risky plan to coax Candie into giving Broomhilda up.<br /><br />The films that inspired \\"Django Unchained\\" are, specifically, Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western \\"Django\\" and the 1975 blaxploitation flick \\"Boss N**ger\\" starring and written by Fred Williamson, which also takes place in the 19th century. \\"Django Unchained\\" was not intended to be historically accurate. \\"Mandingo\\" fights, which are a kind of slave cock-fight as portrayed in the movie, did not exist. The characters are all eccentric, and the violence, borrowed from fairly bloodthirsty genres, is intended to entertain. The soundtrack is rock'n'roll. The film has a linear narrative, unlike many of Tarantino's movies. And it feels much too long at 2 hours and 45 minutes. It goes way beyond the point of tediousness for what is essentially an action-comedy.<br /><br />Tarantino's signature pop culture banter fares poorly in a period piece. There are no cultural references that would both make sense in context and be understood by modern audiences. The dialogue is not as clever as we've come to expect from Tarantino, nor the characters interesting. Our black hero, Django, blows away a lot of white people, but it doesn't have the same significance as in blaxploitation. Blaxploitaiton films played an important economic role for black talent in Hollywood in the 1970s, and they tended to address social issues relevant to black urban communities. They didn't just kill white people. The bad guys were just as often black. The racial violence in \\"Django Unchained\\" is more distasteful than meaningful. If Tarantino is trying to comment on blaxploitaiton films themselves, rather than social issues, it's not at all clear what he's saying.<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" received a host of nominations and awards, including Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay, awarded to Christoph Waltz and Quentin Tarantino respectively. Both of those men received BAFTAs in the same categories. I assume this is the Academy being self-congratulatory, because it believes \\"Django Unchained\\" is some sort of enlightened statement about racism. I wonder if Quentin Tarantino has grasped the irony in his being lauded for being politically correct. It must have been a new experience for him. But I very much doubt that he intended to make any political statement with this film. It's slow and long and unsophisticated, one of Tarantino's weaker efforts. A watered down version of \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\" And Christoph Waltz's performance is a shadow of his brilliant turn in that movie.he same significance as in blaxploitation.

B009AMAJPA|5.0|This film should appeal to guys who are the hyphenated Americans like me. It's dark and has a European flavor. Its main theme is revenge, which the film asserts has the same nature as love. The other theme is: the foreigners may not adapt to the American norms, if only for the sake of integrity. Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace are both terrific and shine despite a convoluted plot. A man of few words, Colin Farrell is a guys-kind-of-guy. Noomi Rapace is an unpredictable and beautiful Frenchwoman, despite the fact that she is Swedish. Her beauty is unorthodox, as is Farrell's scruffiness. He plays a Hungarian despite he is Irish. There are plenty of twists and turns and explosive action scenes, but the movies driver is an attraction between two characters - two lost foreign souls in NYC. Would Farrell pass all Rapace's tests? The duet is prefect. I highly recommended it, despite the idiotic, Tarantino-like action scene at the very end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard and not to easy. I am only on level 4, so I am not sure how hard it will get. If it gets too hard, I will have to quit because there are no hints.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|O'Brian is known to have remarkably accurate descriptions of life in the Royal Navy at the time of this story.  This was a fascinating read, and highly entertaining.
034580404X|1.0|I absolutley hated these books.  I read the first one and gave the rest of them to a friend of mine.  There were so much talk about these books that I ordered all three at one time.  Each time he hit her I cringed.  It had me a nervous wreck.  I was very disappointed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Loved the merciless course of the narrative, heroes coming & dying.<br /><br />If you've seen the TV show, it will be more difficult to imagine the heroes, but the book is by far better than the TV series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it's like a puzzle you have to break out of the room's to go to the next level my daughter loves it. to get to the next levelyou have tobe focused I can't spill the rest of her seceret.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was interesting.  It was well written with a rather unique subject:  centering around a terminally ill teenage girl and her friends and family.  That said, it is not depressing or morbid.  For the most part it is rather humorous and light-hearted.  The author clearly has talent to deal with this topic in such a fashion.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Was not at all what I expected.  It was drawn out over detailed to many complicated characters.  If I read this book as my first JKR book I may not have read any more of her books.  Maybe this story line wasn't for me but I found it a bit boring.  sorry.  I loved her Harry Potter books (which I read many times) I feel that sorry was the most imaginative creative story ever thought off.  Let's see what she writes next.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|comic book, syfy, whole bunch of shootem up.  for them who like syfy this is one to see, I would watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This makes you use your brain and makes you remember. Nice workout for your brain!  Makes you work for the next level.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! It lets you get the thrill of owning a horse and competing. You can name your horse and make you character!!
B00ADS98FC|1.0|We watched this movie based on the customer reviews. It was awful. I am taking the time to write the review in order to save someone else the 1hr 53 minutes of their life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read this trilogy 3 times since it came out and find something new every time.  Newly graduated from college, Ana, the lead female character is new to the experience of  &#34;love&#34; and unfortunately she falls for Christian who is young, very wealthy and totally screw up in the love and sex department.  The romance has the flavor of the rich and famous jet setters with all of Christian toys and money as he lavishes cars, first addition classic books worth thousands and the latest in technology on Ana.  She unfortunately is a book worm who is shy and very intimated but intrigued by this  enigma of a man.  He overwhelms her by dragging her into the dark side of his need for alternative sex and singular lifestyle.  She tolerates and indulges in some of his weirdness in what pleases him sexually hoping to at some point to bring him into the light.  However, Christian just doesn't get it and timid Ana is struggling in this relationship that's turning her life inside down in a whirlwind of emotions.  Christian finally pulls the straw that breaks the camels back and Ana leaves him.  On to the next book.
B00006JKOL|4.0|Regarding the album itself, of course it gets \\"five stars\\" in this silly rating system, as it's one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. You can add another hundred stars, just for good measure.<br /><br />But I'm writing this comment to inform anyone who already has the album, but is perhaps intrigued by the listing of two supposedly live bonus tracks on this edition: They're not live. Someone at the record label must have hoped for extra sales by including erroneous information in the song list. Lying, in other words.<br /><br />All you've got here are alternate studio takes of the introductions to \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and \\"Cold Wind to Valhalla\\" -- unless Ian had figured out how to play acoustic guitar AND flute at the same time, while singing! In fact, the same delay effect that's on his voice in the final, familiar versions can be heard here.<br /><br />All they've done is to slap some extreme reverb on the whole thing to make it sound \\"live.\\" There are certainly no audience sounds -- because the audience included only the engineer and perhaps some other members of the band.<br /><br />Just a warning, in case those \\"live\\" songs had you interested in purchasing another version of a CD you might already have.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My 8 & 9 year olds love this series. They've watched them all and pay attention to the little details such as the sheep \\"droppings\\" in the field. Little Timmy the pacifier sucking cutie steals the show!
B000H5TVJY|1.0|Like most the One-Star ratings say: this is a horrible Blu-ray.  The DVD version looks nicer than this.  Even the boxart is low quality.<br /><br />My copy was one of the unfortunate that does not work correctly on a PS3.  Lionsgate DVDs produced around this time suffer from these problems.
B009H442DG|5.0|It was a long waiting for the comeback of Olivia and John and a much anticipated cd for their  fans
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I HAVENT EVEN PLAYED IT YET AND I CAN TELL GAMELOFT HAS DONE IT AGAIN. gameloft is truly and amazing company
B006LSZECO|1.0|This came highly recommended and will be a future Hollywood movie.  Knowing that, I thought it would at least be interesting and worth my time. The first turn off is the language and  the attitude of the main female character.  She is classLESS!  A real loser!  Sorry I purchased this book!  The author does not deserve my money.  I do not understand how this book even caught the attention of a Hollywood producer.
B00371XIJE|5.0|I don't wish to reveal too much, but this movie is about a real dog, and the way the story was adapted for an American audience was well done and clever. A short time into the movie I found myself saying,&#34;Hey, doesn't anybody own a leash!&#34; But there's a reason.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love how the writer tells the story through the eyes of a dog!  Pets are so agreeable and loyal to humans and this writer has the insight to tell this story!  On the down side, you probably need to be a race car fan or knowledge of their lifestyle.  But, if you love animals, you will enjoy the read.
B000LXQVA4|1.0|Just bought this Fisher Price item to replace our Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper that was recalled today. Looks like a much safer alternative to the Baby Einstein model which \\"due to the 'sun' toy attachment on the activity jumper which can rebound with force and injure the infant, posing an impact hazard.\\" Stick to the Fisher Price models!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The entire story takes place in common place, and a boy that seems common enough. His neighbors are more than what they seem, and yet enjoy his company. They cook delicious bread, and prefer to have a full moon, even when it is not.<br /><br />And now, i am remembering all of the ponds I spent my childhood around. Did whales really jump at me when I crossed that bridge? What about the rocket shaped jungle gym? I look at my own life, and wonder about things. Perhaps at one time I did enjoy the company of someone who owned a backyard that went much further than it should.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Come on it's SHINEDOWN it is not possible to say anything negative! BUY THIS CD YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like how the game gets the horse and rider looking real. It has really good sound effects for everything.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This one US by far the best out of the series that I have read so far! The ending was a surprise.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! The story the action the characters are just amazing! The scenery is beyond phenomenal. It pulls you in and you can't wait for the next episode.
B002N57KG2|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite for me since I was a child. If you like those old crazy 80's car movies this one will fit right in.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The end as many people said is a bit contrived but it was still worth the read. Great summer/vacation novel or something to read before bed.
0553801473|3.0|Georgie needs to light a fire under himself and end this series already. Dragging it out with unnecessary filler just to make more bucks or because he can't figure out how to progress cheats the reader. Most of this book was totally unnecessary to the story and could have been condensed and worked into a faster paced, more enjoyable read in another book, preferable one which moved the story further along. Will finish it, but am pretty disappointed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack for the money. Tons of room, well paded and protected. Holds alll my lenses, camera body, and extras. Highly recommend this product!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is awesome.  It gets a little slow for a while after the first part than starts to pick up quickly.  Great book, great concept, and I am sure it will be an awesome movie.  Don't be surprised if this book explodes in popularity, more than it already has.
B001L63JC8|5.0|I will be honest that I am new to Genesis as of this calendar year. I have listened to trespass, nursery cryme, foxtrot, Selling England By the Pound, Wind Or Wuthering, and a couple others. For me, this to date is my favorite compilation beginning to end. Or sure, it doesn't have the best songs they have written (Supers Ready, Music Box, and others). But it is a very unique endeavor. I can only pick up that the main character seems to have some mental health issues. Some songs go into odd times while others are more straight forward. I love \\"Carpet Crawlers.\\"<br /><br /> It is the odd eclectic mix that is appealing to me. You can almost hear the fractioning of the members as the best Genesis line up put forth their last recording. Top notch effort.<br /><br />  As a side note I have heard recording of Phil Collins doing many of the old Genesis tunes. He is an excellent vocalist and a better percussionist/drummer. My issue with the Phil Collins era after Wind or Wuthering is the song writing. They didn't just lose a vocalist after Peter Gabriel left. They lost his unique writing and personality. Phil Collins is the only one who could have and should have taken his place. I'm glad they kept writing and recording. They just lost a little something for me.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I went to their concert in Chicago and it was the best concert I ever went to ever. I am 66 years old and could not stop dancing.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I  played this game for a few weeks before I got to the end and there was nothing else I could do.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its pretty cool I would say anyone who loves horses should get this game even if you aren't in love with horses you should get this game.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing . In the game it allows you to zoom in through your sights of your gun this game is like  a game I know about called black ops which is fun to .but when you playing online you have  five or six load out but cost  20,000 gameplay points . Don't  worry at all it easy depending on what difficulty your playing on . So this is what I p.o.think about this amazing fps game . Nelson.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|If you haven't checked out the Piano Guys you really need to do it now.  An amazing group of talented men show us that a cello and piano can create more than just classical music.  Add a little humor and some unusual settings and you have an entertaining video of music that just soothes the soul. You won't go wrong with this one!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Wow! I never thought when I picked this book up that it would end like it did. Ms. Day is a truly gifted writer with the ability to put into words the emotions that people feel towards each other. The intensity of the relationship between Eva and Gideon is white hot. They are both really damaged in their pasts and find ways to make this relationship work for them. And have mind blowing sex a lot. I truly can't wait to see what Ms. Day has in store for the third book in this wonderfully interesting series.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have a way of taking current and classical music and giving it a rich sound.  You will enjoy their version of songs using a cello in an interesting way.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Easy to navigate. Has all the qualities I look for in an rpg. It's as good as any rpg for a large game system but I can play from my kindle so I have the time to devote to it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I use the game to unwind after work for a few minutes each day.  This works good for me. Thanks!
B00005JA8B|4.0|It takes me back to when Arnold Schwarzeneger did a lot of action movies. I enjoyed watching it again and again !
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I am enjoying the program.  Unsure if I am actually increasing my &#34;brain power&#34; yet but definitely enjoying the practice!
B00AEFY0F2|4.0|I like this movie so much, still makes me cry after a long time since it came to the theaters years ago.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book, and the details were more explanatory than the movie. It is a charming, cute love story with a touch of violence and spice to it.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I had a good time playing this game it's a game the whole family can enjoy.!<br />So I hope you have a good time playing this also.!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have a child that age myself. Luckily, he grew out of the bothering others stage in kindergarten. His half-brothers never did. One is dead, the other in prison. The idea of this gene is all too real for me. Research will be undertaken. Ever hear of Kallikak (sp?) around time of Rev. War. Resulted in sterilization of thousands.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A great story - compelling characters and a tight nicely interwoven plot. Just don't get too attached to any of the characters - plenty of deaths. Can't wait for the next book.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|A lot of cuts of the records that were never included in other albums or released in US but not in England, or other way around.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This is one of my favorite Howard Hawk's movies!  Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are superb in  this hilarious story about a leopard, a mild-mannered anthropologist and a nutty socialite.  I love the interaction of the characters throughout the movie and I absolutely howl with laughter every time I watch it!  I never get tired of seeing this great classic comedy.  It's one of the best!  I wish they would go back to making movies like this!
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|One of the most difficult reviews I will ever write:<br /><br />This is the most enigmatic piece of cinematography I have ever laid eyes on. The film transcends religion, language, ethnicity, nationality, and individual differences, opening the floodgates of higher thinking. I am a very analytical personality type, and this film is so many things to me. This film is beautiful, inspiring, uplifting, disturbing, upsetting, and agonizing all at once. Overall, the film left me feeling so far removed from the comfortable, routine of the daily grind I have been living in, and had me asking myself some very difficult questions, mostly, why am I here. The last time I felt this way was after a 3-month trip to Uganda for volunteer work in rural jungle villages when I was a junior in college. If you take the film seriously and really ponder it, it will shake you up and leave you feeling a little lied to by your own culture. You forget how wildly biased we all are, and how focused on ourselves we really have become.<br /><br />Considering recent events with the Zimmerman/Martin trial, the Boston Marathon bombings, and school shootings, this film really highlights how we fail to see how interconnected we are, and that we are all in this thing called life together. I could go on and on for pages about the many meanings that I derived from this film, but I won't. The important thing is that you watch it and find out what is says to you, what it means to you. I mean, wow, I just felt kind of blind-sided after I watched it, I really wasn't prepared for such a deep experience, and I think about it quite often, even though I watched it over 3 months ago.<br /><br />Definitely worth owning.<br /><br />Best,<br />-Ben
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This series has been Great! I'm up reading to late but I love this series.  reading number three now. Good story!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Bought this set on Amazon for $19.99...what a deal, especially for Blu-ray!<br />Such classic pieces of the sic-fi horror genre that will only get better with time. I can't believe how real the aliens look even considering the huge advancements in animation and cinematography that have been made since the films were released!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|i likr it because it is real handy too be able tocharge the ear pirce whan threre is no power around and also how long it will chsrge the blue tooth
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I just love this movie and the grandchildren were glued to it used it in the car from Albany to Boston
B002R27J1W|5.0|What's not to love about Audrey Hepburn...and Alan Arkin in this thriller? \\"Wait Until Dark\\" is a suspenseful, classic that STILL leaves me on the edge of my seat, in certain scenes. If you've seen it, then you KNOW what I'm talking about. If you haven't, then it is an absolute MUST-SEE ASAP.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002R27J1W Wait Until Dark]]
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is best game I have ever played, I am glad that it is free, it's so awesome.Glad I got this game.
072325804X|5.0|I buy this every time a friend or family has a new baby - sort of my signature gift. I loved these stories as a child and this is a beautiful way of passing them down for a new generation to enjoy.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I love this music!  It can be very upbeat and very soulful.  I do recommend it for people that like bluesy music.
B000FC146C|5.0|Very nice book  and it is well written!! Surely ,after reading this book you will realize that indeed God works in His own mystic ways!! I will  find time to read more of McCullough's books!!
B000XUFPJS|4.0|The Red Album is the first of many great albums by Baroness. It's got vocals but those seem immaterial most of the time. You listen for the interplay and melodies. Baroness is very good at that. Also the album covers are fantastic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game if you lime to do puzzles. The puzzles are not to hard but are also not to easy and the hint button is helpful without telling you exactly what do do. Can't wait for the next one.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Nobody adapts Baum's other Oz books. This one did. Which is good. I don't care about some wizard. I want to see more of Oz. So this movie delivered. It's dated but still good. Show it to your kids.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 5 yr old grand daughter loves this.  She likes taking care  of her pets and earning coins to buy fun things
B00005JLR2|4.0|Treasure Planet is based off Robert Louis Stevenson's classic book, so it's hard to go wrong here. If you like Pirates of the Carribean, you'll like this, and so will your kids. It's a G-rated adventure tale with a bunch of steampunk-ish, sci fi trappings to move the story out of the past and into a fantasy future. There's nothing really wrong with this movie. It's very entertaining and you'll like the animation and character designs a lot.
B005OP7162|5.0|i haven't been this interested in a TV series since Dallas was on the air 30 years ago! I tend to watch more serious human interest stories and crime shows but Revenge Season 1 really appealed to me. i guess it allows me to escape the worries and hassles of life. I certainly have never purchased an online TV series before so that indicates that I was enthralled by it and was disappointed when the first Season ended which I initially watched on Netflix. I am so thankful Amazon offers both seasons and I immediately purchased Season 1 and Season 2.
B004RLEBTY|4.0|These guys probably drink a lot of beer. I can smell it coming off the tracks. That makes sense, because I always want to drink beer when I listen to this album. I think I'll do that now, because I am a free American. Beer.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|You level up way too fast, and basically a ripoff of dragon story. I do not think this game is the best dragon game. Last time I listen to reviews
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|I like a good ghost story, and this looked like a good ghost story. It's mediocre at best, and sucks in many parts. Mama, the character, is pretty stock-in-trade, but she's at least interesting looking. The characters are dull, witless and pointless most of the time. The kids don't rise far above the creepy kid trope in any old horror movie. The main character, the lady in the rock band, is just dumb. Her boyfriend, even though he's the children's uncle, is useless to the plot and the proceedings.<br /><br />There's only one, truly scary moment, and it doesn't involve Mama or any of the main characters. It's when the uncle is in the hospital and is visited by his dead brother. It don't care if I spoiled that for you. This movie sucks. Watch something else.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Very difficult to use on the new Kindle. When they revamped it a lot of the views were changed and not very user friendly.
B0043XQ932|3.0|The second half brought it down. I like the opener up through about &#34;Ritualist&#34; or so. The rest isn't anything special. I think this band does better with something visual to accompany it. It's like trying to listen to classical in the car. It's great for about ten minutes, but you need the vibe of seeing it or being there to really absorb the power.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was a fun series. My hubby watched it with me and all I can say is hours of fun.<br />Well worth Prime to watch all the series!!!
0380977273|5.0|Great tale about childhood, growing up, growing old, and getting scared by strange things like the &#34;autumn people.&#34; A must if you like scary carnivals. A bigger must if you like small town nostalgia. If you like Bradbury, it's a requirement.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|With out the Alba factor this is a pretty good movie. Ad a taste of Alba and this movie becomes one to watch over and again. I also really like the sound leveling. This movie can bang your doors but if you want it a bit quieter, you don't have to keep raising the volume whenever someone is talking.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I've always had the weather channel app and its been great up until the most recent update. Now the advertisements take up too much space, they have dumb rewards/points and it's no longer as user friendly as it used to be! I'm very disappointed with it now and gave it 3 stars because it used to be great and I'm hoping they'll change it back on the next update.
B007MDB71O|3.0|The movie is based on ERB's collection of books titled &#34;John Carter - WARLORD of Mars&#34;. I think the CGI is first rate and the script is sound. I had a lot of fun watching it and am a long time ERB WoM fan. Not surprising that they smashed a few stories together, I don't expect a sequel.<br />It is sad that Disney decided to make John Carter a &#34;reluctant hero&#34;. I have read the entire series and he never came across as a 'I wanna go home' crybaby type in the books. /sigh/ sign of the times I suppose. The same thing was done to Aragorn in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Is this for the female audience?? Because I promise you Hollywood, men have no problem with a hero that enjoys being a hero.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love despicable me and I love this game! Very entertaining and fun! I highly recommend it no matter what age you are. If you love the movie you'll love the game. If you've never seen the movie you'll love the game!
B007STBUIW|5.0|This is a required movie for any collector. If you don't have it yet... Shame! shame!<br />I love pointing out the line &#34;That's some bad hat Harry&#34;... that plays at the end of every (TV) 'House' series episode is from this movie!<br />I also agree with S.S. when he says he was glad the shark was broken so much since being unable to film numerous scenes made the suspense build more and better.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I loved entering into this book. The first few pages made me feel as if I were at my favorite creamery, ordering the delicious spumoni gelato flavor stocked only there.  Gaiman pitches all of my favorite themes in the first few pages -- unhappy reader, old torn down house, unpleasant childhood memories, to be followed up quickly by the best of all, the appearance of the comforting earth magic brought to us so wonderfully by Diana Wynne Jones. In fact if you've read and enjoyed this book, then I recommend Jones' Pinhoe Egg. It's the same spumoni gelato.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is a sad, yet compelling story told through the voice of a 5 year old little boy who knows nothing of &#34;outside&#34;.  He's been held captive in one room along with his mother who was kidnapped.  Your heart will break knowing what and who he has missed knowing about, how terrified he must have been when he escaped from their captor....then you will smile as he finally says goodbye to &#34;room&#34; and the only life he had known.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is an awesome HOS, click &amp; find, adventure puzzle game!! One of my favorites from Big Fish so far (I'm only about half way through the game)!! A few times during a puzzle the game did go back to the start menu but when I pushed play it always took me right back to my previous spot so it wasn't really a big deal!! The story is cute and the length seems good but the puzzles are much harder than I expected!! I'm sure many people don't agree and maybe I'm just not smart enough but since they give you a skip option I'm ok!! I would recommend this game to anyone that likes Big Fishes typical adventure HOS games!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|i am a die hard hannibal fan. i absolutely loved the twists and turns of this series. great prequel &#60;3
1885167776|3.0|There is beauty in simplicity; in nature, art, business, science and everything in between.<br />Simplicity recognizes the important thing while ignoring the trivial things. Simplicity makes you more efficient and more effective simultaneously.<br /><br />The One Thing by Gary Keller is a quick overview of simplicity. Keller is the founder of one of the largest real estate companies in the world and the author of several successful books. Keller draws on his profitable experience and shares his simple secret to success.<br /><br />The One Thing has an inspiring message, but as a whole the book feels like a long speech by a motivational speaker. The book lacks interesting anecdotes that could really bolster Keller's message. The pages contain curious graphs however none are based on any real numbers just ideas. And it gets a little annoying that the author has pre-underlined parts of the book, that doesn't really give me the opportunity to have the book speak to me.<br /><br />Keller has a good message: focus on the one thing and everything else falls into place. I am not sure if a whole book was necessary, but the message can definitely perk you up. It's sort of like soda, it tastes really sweet, it gets you caffeinated and pumped up but the feeling doesn't last long because there was no real nutrition to sustain you.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wonderfully written story filled with historical information. Couldn't put it down, and was sad when it ended. I would love to read a second novel telling the story of Will Stephens and Lavinia`s futures.
B00269FOHM|5.0|This was an excellent movie. This is an amazing love story - not only between the man and woman, but also the love of a parent for a child.  The passion/chemistry between the characters is undeniable. I am a bit conflicted by the ending, but inspite of how it ended, the movie was captivating.
B008OOYALE|1.0|You never make great progress unless you buy their s***ty gold coins. Waste of time. I expanded a small piece of land for 4,000 silver coins, came back an hour later and a huge tree was growing there and it cost 25,000 silver to remove it!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Went everywhere in town to find this. Could not! Love this from my childhood! Very cool that its on blu-ray!
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Here's someone making music with talent and sincerity and courage. I give all the support I can muster up to this great man, who's work carries a true, uplifting message and is only going to get better as he progresses, perhaps the most beloved of his generation.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Dont let it being a movie fool you. This is reality going on right now. Has been going on for awhile. Its not particularly new but not old compared to where we are in this world on this time peice.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|No matter, Rod'd records are great. can listen to voice forever, love the songs he picks out to sing, enjoyed it
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Watching it all over again. Very well made season. Can't wait for season 4 to start and become available on prime.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Took a chance , don't necessarily like Buble's voice or sing stlye. some songs are okay , but not the type I enjoy listening to. Tip read jacket and get if you like the tunes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has it all. Different translations of the Bible, most of which come with audio. Bible studies of all kinds. Easy to navigate. It has all I need to learn God's Word.I love it!!
0670026603|5.0|This is a rather simple story about a girl with no special skills who takes a job as a caretaker for a young man who is a paraplegic.  The excellent writing about even the most mundane things made me really care about the characters, so much so that I ended up crying in a couple of spots - something that hasn't happened to me since I saw &#34;Old Yeller&#34; as a child.  I was surprised about how good the character development was by the writer, Jojo Moyes.  As a person who normally reads only mysteries, history and science, I would recommend that you go outside your safe zone and try this book.  You can always try your local library, however mine here in Santa Monica, CA already has it on hold for several people.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I'm not really impressed with this. I downloaded 3 YouTube Videos to my Kindle Fire HD and only one played all the way thru.<br />The others stopped half way through with a message saying it couldn't play on this device. It played the first half just fine. Bummer
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Just used this app for the first time. Now I am a beginner to working out but I'm feeling it. I broke a sweat for sure.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a quick move game and a great way to pass the time. Easy to play and down load
B008133MDK|5.0|I am addicted to this series. The first episode of this, the second season, is my personal favorite. This whole season is phenomenally brilliant.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is easy to download but figuring out how to use the game and its tools and levels is a bit confusing. Your suppose to accumulate points before going to a different room but when the game says I can go to a different room it brings me right back where I began and says I don't have enough points to go to another room. What gives?
B00499QUK2|5.0|This BBC TV series is excellent. I wish I could give it more stars. It is written very intelligently. The stars are wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|l<br />this is a great game. I find some of the items difficult to determine but if you keep.clicking around it eventually works out.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is such a fun game!! I had to buy the full version, could not get enough!!! If you like card games you will love this game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have always loved the wizard of oz and I loved this book .It was awesome and I loved it.
B000002O4X|5.0|The music reminded me of a trip to Kenya to see house from the movie. I bought a CD for my Mom too.
1449437524|5.0|Gross and funny at the same time.  The little dog reminds me of my dog ...... and the strange things he does.
B000U1ZV3U|3.0|Decent movie but the actors' mustaches are absolutely terrible! You're not fooling anyone Tom Sizemore!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Deleted all of my stuff  started closing out on me this game is horrible and it started to take all of my stuff and money away
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Good looking and solid case. Love the quality and color too. I recommend this case. I get compliments on it too.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I really like this app. I like playing around with combining sounds and music. Plan on letting my son use it when he has trouble sleeping.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I like watching movies that attempt to authenticate historical settings. I feel like this movie did that. I also like Tom Hardy
B001OQCV2E|5.0|A VERY revealing look at the dynamics of the HAVES and the HAVE NOTS around the world.  A real eye opener for anyone who thinks that their government considers them or gives a damn about their survival when a crisis arises that will put their butts in jeopardy.
B00005R8FI|5.0|An album of pure genius, combining the smooth blues/jazz of John Mayall with Johnny Almond's exquisite saxophone........so sublime it could give you goosebumps.  This is incomparable music for mid-summer......the sound of walking out of urban heat and humidity into some obscure basement jazz club.  Listening to the Turning Point, you're immediately transformed, a thousand times cooler than you ever thought before.  How to describe pure bliss?  Ten stars would fall short........
B00008G8M4|5.0|An absolute MUST HAVE if you love America and love the freedoms we enjoy compared to the other nations on the planet
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is such a cool game with tons of fun I thought there were many good ideas and I was playing it for ages
B004DLPXAO|2.0|No way to get kindle format (azw ) for my aoson  keeps crashing  no support to get help for this.. really suck's now I really refuse to buy those kindle books
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My boys play this game constantly and we all have a great time giving it a try.  we all love it.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|The video kept stopping and re-loading.  It maid it difficult to watch and enjoy the movie.  If this keeps happening I'm not likely to continue to order videos.
055358202X|4.0|Before I read A Feast for Crows, George R.R. Martin's 4th entry in his Song of Ice and Fire series, I was aware this one wasn't particularly liked by the fans, and now I understand why.<br /><br />Faced with a problematically-long manuscript, Martin made the (now controversial) decision to split up some of the character arcs between this book and the following one, A Dance With Dragons. Not a bad decision, per se, but the unfortunate result for many fans is that some of their favorites are MIA from this book entirely. And to further rub salt in the wound, Martin then took another six years to complete the fifth book after he optimistically announced that it should be done by the end of the following year.<br /><br />I thought the writing in Feast was just as good as A Clash of Kings, but it's evident here that your story's only as good as your characters. Some of the newer players are developing well, but their arcs still lack the excitement a more-established character would provide.<br /><br />All in all, I'm solidly invested in this series and I plan to see this thing through to the end.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Do yourself a favour and just read this book. It is so full of heart and tenderness and humour. Just wonderful. It will make you laugh and cry. And Moyes has handled tragic issues with both sensitivity and humour.<br />I loved this book and didn't want it to end!! Ten out of ten
193700788X|3.0|I was happy with the seller and the state of the book when it arrived. Very disappointed in the book itself, seems like it was just thrown together. In the time it took Charlaine to put this out you'd think it would have been longer and more well thought out
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for all ages. I find it difficult to stop playing. Gotta love the minions. very easy to play. Only down as side unless you are willing to spend money you can't get slot of the extra bits but still a fabulous game.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Since the weather is the first thing I check each morning before leaving to teach my classes, this app is especially helpful and almost always accurate.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My kids loved this one as well..because they all learned to share this game while others looked on and waited their turn
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|What can you say about one of the greatest bands ever, nothing just listen to the music and word and enjoy.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|this game is a three cuz i just tried to play it, and it just went all wacko... it waz ridiculous and im very mad
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have read so many books this way. It's so easy & compact. Better than having to keep up with an actual book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic graphics. Fun if you love horses. Keeps you busy and you learn A lot of stuff.<br />You get to take care of your horses and train them and make them get to know you.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story line had potential but I didn't particularly care for the way he told the story.  At times it was a tedious read.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's a great game to play especially on a tablet or something with a larger screen!  You can play it with your friends and have fun fun fun.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Read about the album when it first came out and was so glad I purchased it.  I listened to it daily for at least 2 months, memorizing many of the songs.  It has dropped out of my top 10, but I still put it in the car stereo now and again.
B001EN71HC|5.0|These movies are a classic and I had to have them! Im glad they put them in a box set.
0061735817|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman and anything that he writes.  Thought there is always a story line, the more interesting feature of his writing is his wry and pithy observations of human nature.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have literally no bad comments about this game. Definitely one of my all-time favorite games. Beautiful graphics, a great plotline, and just the right amount of HO games.<br />All in all: BEST GAME EVER!
159562015X|4.0|Very well conceived book.  Obviously meant to be helpful to people still in the workplace, which I am not.  However, a few friends have read it (half still working; half retired) and we shared what our results were and why we felt the results were accurate.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be my go-to app each morning. Updated format has completely ruined a perfectly usable program. Please consider giving the option to opt-out of this update?!? I've uninstalled and moved on to accu weather... but would happily return to TWC app if previous version was made available as an option.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I think it is near perfect and so much better than regular wipes, but the red dot pops off at times and the case pops open occasionally.  Near perfect
1878424505|4.0|This book is a wonderful eye opener! After reading this book I have changed the way I communicate with people. It is definately a positive influence!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is great for androids but I personally think that it take way to long to get upgraded I love the game but it would be better if the upgrades were faster but overall its a great game and if I love it than hopefully u will too.:)and its definitaly worth the money.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is possibly the best app you will ever get for your Kindle Fire. I was having big problems with freezing and Wi-Fi shut down. Clean Master solved all my problems and freed up a lot of storage space. I am very pleased with this app!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it .it's crazy fun for everyone. You should try it . Tell a friend and try to best each other
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|_Just like the card game tho no shuffling required. Only complaint is the amount of games u can play in a row. To get &quot; gold coins&quot;  for playing requires multiple log ins daily plus leveling up. I wish the payouts were better but fun for a short while. It is free tho and some rounds get tough competition. Might as well try it out__
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Battle Los Angeles is:<br /><br />1.  One of the all time great actioners. It never lets up. I don't think I've ever quite seen an action sci-fi film filmed like this.  Pounding, relentless, and brilliant.<br /><br />2.  Acting- Eckhardt is magnificent, and the rest of the cast does very well.<br /><br />3.  Story-  Simple, but great.  It felt natural, and the story conveyed great heroism, tragedy and emotions.<br /><br />4.  Cinematography- A 10.<br /><br />Simply put, if you like all out non stop action, then this is the movie for you.  Get it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett engages the reader quickly into the lives of his characters. He then effortlessly weaves their stories into the history books of The Great World War. I will definitely read the entire series.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|now I can share it with the kids and they love it, too!  it is on heavy rotation at our house!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|we love this game. Had heard it mentioned a few times and decided to buy it for a trip. we fell in love with the expansion, trading, and bargaining right away.<br /><br />we changed one or two rules to fit us (new settlements must be connected by roads & 13 VP to win)<br /><br />already considering getting one of the expansions and a 5-6 player extension!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Run smoothly on Galaxy Note 2. Good graphics, duels via Bluetooth, perfect localization. It is a pity, that there no way to create new fully customized decks. 5 stars anyway.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have loved Boz Scaggs since I was a teenager.  I went to see him in concert this year and got a chance to listen to some songs from this new album and knew I had to have it.  I play it over & over and still can't get enough of it.  My favorite cuts are &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34;, &#34;So Good To Be Here&#34;, &#34;Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl&#34;, &#34;Love On a Two Way Street&#34;, &#34;You Got Me Cryin&#34;, &#34;Sunny Gone&#34;, &#34;Cadillac Walk&#34;, &#34;Corrina, Corrina&#34;, &#34;Can I Change My Mind&#34;, &#34;Dry Spell&#34;, &#34;Pearl of The Quarter&#34;, &#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34;..!!
B00B32X786|3.0|You want to like this movie because there is some good acting but I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted my time.
0307951529|5.0|I am a super slow reader and yet I read this book in 6 days. I simply couldn't lay it down so to speak. One of the best and most inspirational books I have ever read.<br />Please write another!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Couldn't put the book down! Read the whole book in one day. Can't wait to start the next one!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Ihave always loved Nemo, and of course Dorey!<br />The animation is awesome. This game is so cute! The colors are beautiful!
B00DQR26EC|3.0|Game play was alright, no options for choosing different characters, the four nerds are all you get. Game has way too much cussing and sacrilege comments. The dialogue isn't perfect, but you get by.
B001NR8F2O|5.0|The reason for buying this album is because it's the last real Kiss recording that features the original members. The reunion album (Psycho Circus) only had Ace and Peter on a few songs. So for those like myself who wanted to hear the reunited band after decades apart, this is it. Performance wise it doesn't measure up to Alive or Alive II, but it's still solid. Gear wise they're not using those vintage Gibson guitars and Marshall amps like in old days, and I think that makes a difference in the tone. Recording wise I like that I can hear separation between the Ace and Paul's guitars. Peter's drumming is the weakest of the group performance wise, but it's not a big problem. For me it's always been about Ace's guitar leads and Paul's vocals, and hearing them shine in the year 2000 is great. Again, this original lineup will probably never reform or record again, so this is historic in my book.

0761129235|3.0|One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way is a nice little book.  It clocks in at under 200 pages and has a somewhat interesting premise.  Based on the Japanese technique of Kaizen, or continuous improvement through small steps, the author lays out a plan that follows that logic.<br /><br />I would classify this book as a Twitter book because you can sum it up in 140 characters or less.  \\"Start small and celebrate every improvement you make on the road to success.\\"<br /><br />And when the author says small, he means small.  For instance, if you want to get in the habit of flossing your teeth he advises to start with one tooth!  My dentist told me that same thing, but I don't think she read it in this book.<br /><br />Either way, starting small and making small progress while trying to change makes total sense to me.  What I have a hard time accepting is if you have the discipline or willpower to floss one tooth a night until it becomes a habit why not just floss all your teeth?<br /><br />And why did this review suddenly become about dental hygiene?  Floss, don't floss, that is between you and your dentist.  I know there are better books out there for those who want to change something in their life and I would put this book at the end of the line.

193700788X|3.0|I feel bad for Charlaine Harris-people have been pretty harsh in their reviews. I read them before I read the final book, so I was \\"prepared\\". I am ok with whom Sookie ended up. Honestly, I would have been ok with Bill, Quinn or Sam. I felt like CH just ran out of steam with Eric. It was like she-and he- completely lost their fire. Where was Eric in the book? The Eric from earlier books had a vital spark- a huge appeal-this Eric was just a shell and not worth fighting for. I think Sookie was just worn out with the whole vampire world at the end. Was Sam the \\"safe\\" choice? Maybe, but in real life, sometimes that is the right choice-he was a supe, he obviously (to me anyway) had a spark for Sookie from book one on, he could turn into ANY animal-they didn't play him up-he wasn't bigger than life acting-but he was about as real as any supe she knew. she could make a real life with him.  Bill also had a real spark for Sookie-but his love was doomed from the start due to his initial calculated meeting with her -and I felt sorry for Bill. I think he had NO idea how he'd feel about Sookie when he first went to meet her. Quinn-well, sookie blew him off big time-I didn't buy her dumping him because he had a problem mom and sister-that was NOT typical of her character. But Quinn was really a good guy and would have been fine as the \\"winner of her heart\\" too. The real Eric, I think, had bigger long term aspirations that Sookie could provide. But the story itself-pretty lame-let's have a sleepover and get everybody to show up for a curtain call. whoop de doo. CH should have ended this book with a \\"5 yr later\\" update -SOMETHING to satisfy, to show how it all really went for them. buying a reference dictionary to see how they all ended up-well, even I won't waste money on THAT addendum. lame. Overall-I liked the entire big picture of the series. here were characters I loved-Sookie, Diantha, (sigh) Eric, Bill, Sam... I just wish she'd ended it with a catchy story just like she started with. It wasn't awful-it was just-maybe barely-adequate.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|excellent complex story with evocative writing. So fascinating the way Hosseini weaves his tale through time and space. Enjoyed immensely.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This is a novel that starts out with one heroine and moves on to the next one. As the story progresses, multiple characters head to Greece to stop a wedding and the side stories become more interesting than the main story. Not one character is believeable. Not one character is that likeable. And in the end the wackiness of the characters becomes less and less funny. It was like reading the plot from that old movie IT'S A MAD MAD WORLD. It might have been hilarious years ago, but not today. It's just old and tired comedy. Same goes for this story. I felt cheated at the end of the book.<br />Would I recommend: No.
B004UFEJXK|4.0|Bowling for Movies Score: 264.375 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />Wall-E - We own the 3-Disc Blu Ray / DVD version - Blu Ray Feature + Bonus Materials, DVD Version<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />Lonely but highly mobile trash compactor (Wall-E) finds tricked-out robo-gal-pal (EVE) - loses girl - tracks down girl across the universe and accidentally gives an exiled humankind the nudge needed to return to their apocalyptic and abandoned pig-sty home planet - EARTH (and their true purpose - farming).<br /><br />Overall this was a wonderful story, extremely well animated, and with a poignant warning about the possible impact of uncontrolled consumerism.  My daughter loved the love story and the animation and my wife and I could reflect on how humanity is losing its, um, humanity via the electronic revolution and the dependency / convenience it provides.  A snarky dude such as myself would point out the electronic revolution is what made the technology which brought this beautifully computer-animated flick to life aaaaand unrestrained consumerism provided the $$$.  After uttering this remark my wife would simply look at me (with The Look, come on married guys, you know what I mean) and then say, \\"Shut up.\\"  We have watched this movie at least 25 times and we are likely to watch it at least 25 more times.<br />What I loved:<br /><br />1.  True love story between Wall-E and EVE beautifully (both sentimentally and cinematically) unfolded with minimal dialog (words were so very unnecessary - I enjoyed the silence)<br />2.  CGI MAGIC, some of the most breath-taking scenes of any movie, expertly rendered and masterfully woven together - achieved \\"true art\\" status<br />3.  Encapsulated message about standing up for what's right and robotic love leaves you wondering how a pile of computer chips could become so very very human<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />1.  At times I didn't know if I was at a kids movie or simply getting lectured by an environmental group / anti-big-box store documentary which pulled me out of the movie long enough to contemplate the hypocrisy of the on-screen preaching / off screen merchandising... how many plastic Wall-E related toys are sitting in landfills RIGHT NOW... hmmm<br />2.  Abandoned apocalyptic world might be too scary for younger viewers and could spark difficult conversation with children about American consumer culture while buying ANYTHING at ANY STORE, ANYWHERE (No little Jimmy, not every store is a huge BnL store which is going to put us all off-planet to live in complete comfort and luxury)<br />3.  Director Andrew Stanton's \\"behind the scenes\\" muffled attempt at interjecting Biblical themes which are so off the mark and uninteresting that most people wouldn't catch them and at least 16% of the US population (and most of Europe) would simply roll their eyes<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.  Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies :]  Want me to review a movie and score itin an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The storyline in this book is so messed up that I found myself thinking how nuts it was and at the same time how much I liked it. I couldn't decide while reading if I should be on Nick's side or Amy's side; which made this an even more interesting read.<br /><br />It was so messed up and crazy that I literally couldn't stop. Nick and Amy are probably some of my favorite book characters. They're both intelligent, surprising, hilarious, and certifiably nuts. Go is a great character as well. Can't wait to see this come to life as a movie!<br /><br />[*SPOILER ALERT*.... KINDA]<br /><br />Amy is actually a psychopath.... and I liked it. Made me feel like everytime my husband calls me crazy for nagging him about something little that I could say that he's never seen crazy wife. haha.

B004J4WLPU|4.0|3.5 of 5 stars<br /><br />Bee returns to England from New York when her younger, pregnant sister Tess goes missing.  Within days Tess's body is discovered. Unbeknownst to Bee, Tess had given birth to a stillborn son days before her death, so the police, her mother, and her psychiatrist  believe she committed suicide, but Bee remains convinced the true cause is murder and sets out to solve the crime. The suspects include:Tess's stalker, her elderly landlord, and her married lover, whose wife is also pregnant. Subplots include Bee's declining relationship with her fianc&eacute;, her strained relationship with her mother, and the death of her brother, two decades earlier from cystic fibrosis.<br /><br />SISTERS,  primarily in the first/second person POV as a letter from Bee to Tess, is at times lyrical in this genre-defying debut novel. Others has described SISTERS as a thriller, but while suspenseful, I never felt the page-turning aspect I expect to from thrillers. There was a character-study aspect to this novel, but I never felt a true connection to either Bee or Tess, and I didn't feel the characters were as multidimensional as I usually do from character driven stories.  Perhaps mystery is the most appropriate label. I was quite interested in the true manner of death and culprit, if  any, though not so intrigued that I stayed awake turning pages.  SISTERS is an above average debut, and I will look for other books by Rosamund Lupton.

B00CX7OX6U|5.0|I am not a Christian (or a theist at all), but this film strikes me as a fascinating and movingly Christian reflection on how its author learned to love.  The film's protagonist, Neil (Ben Affleck), is not a 'character' in the film but instead provides the sensibility or subjectivity through which the plot of the film develops.  The plot-line is this: Neil thinks he knows how to love, it soon emerges that he doesn't know how to love, then through the course of the film he learns how to love.  He learns at last how to love Marina (Olga Kurylenko) partly through consultation with Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who shares his own struggles with his love-commitment to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />If you know a bit about Terrence Malick's life, you suspect that these reflections are autobiographical: the 60-something Malick probing how the 30- or 40-something Malick learned to partake in genuine love relations.  But that doesn't matter much.  The force of the inquiry does not depend on its status as autobiography.<br /><br />The potential viewer of this film faces two questions: do you want to reflect on how you came, or might someday come, to love? and do you want to reflect on this from a specifically Christian point of view?<br /><br />As I said, I don't myself share that point of view: that's not how I conceptualize my own learning-how-to-love experiences.  But then I didn't learn how to love in Oklahoma either.  (I did it, or tried, in Los Angeles, with a woman from farther away than France.)  The film's reflections are specific to the experiences of its maker, but they explore a universal human problem.<br /><br />The film is not entertainment.  I aims not to sweep you away from your life for two hours but to plunge you more deeply into it.  If you don't want to reflect on your life and on how you have loved or failed to love those with whom you have shared it, don't watch.  But if you are drawn to such reflections, this film may help you pursue them.<br /><br />(Itmay also help you see how film can serve as a medium for such reflection, if that wasn't already apparent to you.  But this particular film is not about film.)
B008VBYN80|3.0|Overall the game is fun but you get to a certain point where the game relies too heavily on diamonds.  Need diamonds to purchase upgrade units.  Need diamonds to complete tasks.  Before you know it you've dropped $100, that's when the game is no longer fun.
B0001V6ZJ8|3.0|Moulin Rouge, 1952 film<br /><br />This is a movie about Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the French painter who lived at the end of the 19th century. He suffered from a disease that affected his bones and limited his growth. His paintings of Parisian night life are no longer in fashion. That top knot hairstyle was in fashion for women then, rather than traditional long hair. The subject matter of this film was considered scandalous at the time. Henri paints the women and scenes of his era. He uses live models in his rooms. One hired model talks about her life. A pushcart license created economic freedom and independence, says a model. Henri and other artists talk about their business at a restaurant. What is a painting worth? Like any other commodity, only what people are willing to pay for it.<br /><br />His model is very temperamental. Is it due to life on the streets? They dine at a fancy restaurant, starting with champagne. Marie feels ill, Henry is sensitive about his legs. [Most people are happy when they can criticize someone else.] This movie recreates scenes of Parisian life. Should Henri give up his way of life and return home? Henri paints people of the streets and the gutter. Henri seeks the missing Marie, but she doesn't want him. [This is like some story about romance.] Back home Henri turns on the gas jets. [Coal gas contained carbon monoxide, unlike natural gas.] He touches up a painting, then turns off the gas jets. Performers at the Moulin Rouge criticize one of his paintings. Copies of his paintings are copied for advertising placards. We see girls dancing the \\"can-can\\", considered scandalous. La Goulue is the star.<br /><br />Henri sketches the patrons and performers of the Moulin Rouge. His paintings are offered for sale to the wealthy. One is bought by the King of Serbia! Henri drinks too much. Will an early death cause his paintings to soar in value? [No more are being produced.] Other scenes are shown. Henri discusses love in a cynical way. Does he drink to find oblivion? One woman has an old painting done by Henry. Henry and his lady friend visit the races and then a theater with a variety show. Then a boat ride on the Seine. People watch an old dancer complain about her fate. Henry takes her to the hospital, then talks to Miriam. When he hears bad news he drinks a lot of absinthe. His drinking takes its toll, he falls down the stairs. The Louvre will hang his paintings in his lifetime, a great honor. Hie past life flashes before his eyes.<br /><br />The \\"Red Mill\\" had a bar, restaurant, and dance floor. Upstairs it had rooms that could be rented by the hour. This movie about Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec was unusual, few movies are made about artists. One attraction is the recreated scenes of Parisian life at the end of the 19th century. You can learn about those times by the inferences from the talk. One franc was worth about a quarter dollar, I think. These \\"Good Old Days\\" would soon come to an end with an economic depression and the Great War. Is it worth watching? How does it compare to the more recent film with the same name? The rise of television in the 1950s led to fewer movie customers and theaters during the next decades, and their end.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|I finally finished this Kindle book and I absolutely loved it!!  Because I've seen both Sherlock Holmes movies all I could do is picture Robert Downey Jr.as Holmes  & Jude Law as Watson.  All the stories were intriguing and just when you think you have them figured out as to what the villians may have been up to here comes the twist and the extrodinary explanation from Holmes himself.  I also enjoyed the whole idea that you were reading each story from what was suppose to be Sherlock's best friend and co-worker Watson with the exception of a few stories that were suppose to be directly from Sherlock himself.  All in all best read ever definitely worth having in your Kindle or paperback collection!!! =D

B0090SI3ZW|3.0|Man, where to begin?  Firstly, I am a life-long fan of martial arts films.  Everything from Kurosawa's 1943 (Judo vs Jujitsu) classic \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\", to the modern gore & brutality of 2011's \\"The Raid\\", and just about everything in between.  I fell in love with film fighting during the '80s, when I was allowed to stay up late to watch \\"Kung Fu Theater\\", featuring traditional Chinese fighting styles and costumes.  My discovery was probably not too long after the film's 1st time writer/director, RZA, began his own obsession with this particular brand of escapism.  When I first heard that RZA was writing and directing a kung fu movie, I could barely contain my excitement.  A while later, when I finally saw the first trailer for it, I could hardly contain my contempt.  It looked awful.  After unfavorable reviews started pouring in, I thought it best to cut my losses and avoid seeing it at all.  Many months passed until just last week, when it was available for checkout from my local library.  A trusted source's recent reserved recommendation sealed the deal.  I lowered my expectations and had a go.  I gotta say, there was some pretty cool stuff going on here.  Was it still disappointing?  Yes, but if I came away with anything, it's a sincere hope that RZA continues in this profession.  My man leapt right into the 35th Chamber of filmmaking, and while not graduating, I think he showed the monks he means business.<br /><br />In Jungle Village (kind of a late-1800s, Chinese version of Mos Eisley from \\"Star Wars\\"), powerful clans converge to steal a large portion of gold that will be escorted through town via the governor's order.  Knowing of the cutthroats that reside there, the governor has requested the extra security of the Lion clan.  The clan's leader, Gold Lion (Chen Kwan Tai, \\"Dragon Tiger Gate\\") agrees until his lieutenants, Silver (Byron Mann, \\"Belly of the Beast\\") & Bronze (Cung Le, \\"Dragon Eyes\\") betray and murder him.  Seems they want the gold for themselves.  Not taking the other clans too seriously, it seems the only real threat to their plan is Gold's son, Zen Yi, aka the X-Blade (Rick Yune, \\"Ninja Assassin\\"), and eventually Thaddeus (RZA, \\"Coffee & Cigarettes\\"), the town's blacksmith, whose business is booming with weapon requests for the impending rumble.  There are many other characters, including Russell Crowe  (\\"L.A. Confidential\\") as the Englishman, Jack Knife, and Lucy Liu (\\"Kill Bill\\") as the owner of the local brothel that EVERYONE frequents.<br /><br />I refuse to call out RZA for plagiarism because these types of films borrowed from one another quite liberally and I recognized most of his source material.  The majority of this picture was borrowed from \\"The Kid With The Golden Arm\\" (1979), \\"Flag of Iron\\" (aka \\"Spearman\\", 1980), and \\"Crippled Avengers\\" (1978): movies starring the group of 6 actors known as the Venom mob (from their most popular film together, \\"5 Deadly Venoms\\"), who worked for the Shaw Brothers studio in the mid-to-late '70s, specifically for the late director Chang Cheh (\\"One Armed Swordsman\\").  Elements are also borrowed from other Shaw flicks, like \\"Cave of the Silken Web\\" (1967) and \\"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\\" (1978).<br /><br />The fight scenes?  It saddens me to report that, well, frankly, they suck.  The bullseye (or at least its periphery) of RZA's target audience is more-or-less me and had the kung fu been good I would've been absolutely enamored with this film.  Dreadful use of wires, editing, CGI gore, and slow motion totally sink the action.  RZA and co-writer Eli Roth (\\"Hostel\\") developed original weapons for the film and they're pretty sweet.  If only they had figured out a way to shoot the scenes where these items were utilized.  Rick Yune, Cung Le, and WWE/MMA fighter Dave Bautista (as Brass Body) are really the only ones that get to show off any good moves but they're still disappointing due to poor handling.<br /><br />The Universal DVD contains both R-rated and Unratedversions, coming in at 96 & 108 minutes, respectively.  The image is colorful and splendid with a nice 2.40:1 widescreen picture.  Spoken languages are available in English, Spanish, and French, with subtitles in English or French.  Special features include: deleted scenes, \\"A Look Inside...\\", \\"Path To The East\\", and \\"On The Set With RZA\\".  I really can't recommend this as a martial arts film but I can as a slice of kung fu nostalgia for old-school fans.  The casting was excellent and the acting, story, score, and direction were actually much better than I expected.  Sets & costumes were well done, too.  Really, everything but the action, which is kind of a big deal for this genre.<br /><br />2012versions, coming in at 96 & 108 minutes, respectively.

B000JML7EC|5.0|Every bit as entertaining now as it was when I read it as a child, 30 years ago. A classic.
1451629184|5.0|I am haunted not by what happened during the capture but the time BEFORE.  This intimate true story will rock you to your core and rely make you look at your children and how important their safety and well being is.  I read this in a day!
7885726770|5.0|It is old, but still the best version of this classic movie. It's great. Great story with outstanding acting. I could watch it over and over again.
0307341577|5.0|After one Gillian Flynn you will have to read them ALL back to back. Pure pleasurable suspenseful dark reads! Reading this was pure pleasure- fingernail biting can't pull your nose out of the book pleasure! I am such a fan!  I am leery of loaning this one out because I want to make sure I get it back!
B00006JI11|1.0|This dvd did not play.  All it would say was error!  I was told by seller this was made for a different format, or country.  I must have missed that in the small print!!!  A waste of money and a waste of postage to return!!
0307341550|5.0|After one Gillian Flynn you will have to read them ALL back to back. Pure pleasurable suspenseful dark reads! Reading this was pure pleasure- fingernail biting can't pull your nose out of the book pleasure! I am such a fan!  I am leery of loaning this one out because I want to make sure I get it back!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Also bought this for my son who requested it to make music on the computer he was happy and no complaints.
0333961447|3.0|I love this book but I could have SWORN there was another version that was The Spiffiest giant in town.  Well I didn't notice the change to &#34;smartest&#34;. Regardless, the story of giving and love is truly undeniable good teaching for our children! A great story of unconditional love and what really makes us smart or &#34;spiffy&#34; in another version!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|He requested them as his gift from us and he was really excited.Was going to have a movie marathon.No complaints.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Just a lovely story. I really enjoyed this one.  I would recommend it to almost anyone who enjoys a sweet story.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This movie has little to no plot, just a lot of high brow conversations that aren't even interesting.  Almost nothing ever happens and you don't care much about the people your looking at.  I expected better from Cronenburg.  Wish I had my 2.99 back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i know how everybody gives the same cliche &quot;love it&quot; response just to get the review done, and arent very useful, but i like to provide valid info. this game is addicting, but it has a few glitches. sometimes i will get a gru token (which are very rare) and the game will glitch out and restart. i will lose my progress on that board and it wont give me my token. which, another thing, the game doesnt make enough possible ways to get gru tokens. like some things cost 7000 tokens when in reality you can only get a token every blue moon. so the only way to get a huge stock is to buy them with real money, which to me is complete bs (bad service). but i still love the game reguardless of the minor flaws. i hope you found this helpful. sorry for the essay
B004VMVTNU|1.0|I downloaded this app to get me up in college. I PAID $1.99 FOR THIS STUPID APP! I loved the fact that you could make it play your own music to wake you up. And boy does it wake you up! I had mine play &quot;Good Morning Beautiful&quot; by Steve Holy (great song, by the way. Look it up.) Which it did, but it started playing much louder than I had imagined it would. And then, when I woke up and tried to turn off the alarm, the app crashed! I couldn't turn the ever increasing volume down at all, nor stop the music. I closed the app, which did nothing. I deleted the app, which did nothing. I had to shut down my kindle fire HD to get it to shut up! So now I'm out $2 for an app I haven't even successfully been able to use. Great idea for the app-not so great delivery. Better luck next time.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Clever, funny, intelligent....the best spin on Sherlock Holmes yet. And it also satisfies the murder mystery television watching audiences. Jonny Lee Miller should win every award possible for best lead actor in a series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it's just like temple run but you can switch lanes in this cool game<br /><br />It is also for little kids to there nothing bad in there
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I love \\"The Fog\\".  It is probably my 2nd favorite horror film of all time, after \\"Halloween\\".  The mood of the film is creepy, the filming locations are so beautiful, the cast is amazing, the story is scary, and the music is just beyond beautiful.  I love the pacing of the film, with the slow build-up to the end.  John Carpenter's direction is dead-on.  Some of the most wonderful, and beautiful filming done by Dean Cundey.  The filming locations are awesome.  Just look at the opening establishing pan-up shot of the ocean & title.  The 2nd Unit shots of the green countryside are beautiful, too.  There's not enough I can say about this film.  It's a shame that the re-make was so horrendous.  Some of the new generation movie-goers might find this film to be a little dated, and a little slow on the pacing.  This is an example of how wonderful horror films were made back in hey-day from 1978-1986.<br /><br />Christopher John Sorick<br />Omaha, Nebraska
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Good enough for the price. Good for maintaining your working steel. For the good steel get a dmt sharpener set.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good.  kids would enjoy playing. you get to learn about horse if u don't no much about them and how to train them. its a free game but tryst to get you to spend money on it
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like it its a good game and I win a lot and I like that you play against other people and its not easy to win.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an extremely fun game. it is easy to play when you get the hold of it. I recommend this game for everyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever, now I hope the movie is just as good can't wait too November comes around to see it
0740797719|5.0|This is one of the best books for experienced artists, it belongs in your art book collection. It is like an encyclopedia of light and color techniques, with explanations of how and why. I'm an experienced artist with two degrees and I'm still astonished by how much I learned from this book.<br />James Gurney is a very talented artist, there are few books on the market written by really talented artists. Most often, art books are written by an art teacher or someone with passion but little talent and It can be hard to learn from someone you've already surpassed in knowledge. If you've ran into that problem in the past this is the book for you!
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|Every CD in the box is not essential, but to buy the ones that are (Deguello, Fandandgo, Tres Hombres) individually would cost you just as much, and all of the albums have at least a couple of interesting tracks. The remastering sounds good and the packaging is nice.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I love Once Upon A time.  To be honest I started watching it solely because of my infatuation with Jennifer Morrison.  The show is amazing and the characters are awesome!
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Classic Jack Reacher. A good read. I liked the romantic involvement in this one. Somewhat predictable but held my interest.
0307352153|5.0|I appreciated the information inside the book. Being an introvert it is nice to see that it does have it's advantages as well as drawbacks.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|My kid asked for this.  I bought it and he was able to download it while away from home and the CD arrived a few days later and he really enjoys the music.
B003FK8V7G|5.0|To me, it's like a mix of The Clash & Springsteen. It's tough to find new bands playing classic rock & roll.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie can take more than one viewing to assimilate all of its meaning.  Once you own it, you will want to review it every once in a while to reflect on their prose and wise outlook.  (As Tom Hanks respondes to the question, after reviewing the script, do you know what it is about? No)!
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|This my third Hosseini book (they are all great). His writing is fantastic with description that ingite your imagination to the point that you feel that your in the scene. You can read all the articles about Afganistan you want; but, to get a real feeling about the country, its culture and its harsh recent history, his books are required reading.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|... then re-read the rights.  Why does an app need to know when the OS is done booting?  The ONLY reason is so it can begin running before you are playing it.  And why would a game need to do that?  After all, both Amazon and Google are very happy to auto-update these apps AT YOUR CHOOSING.  Nice app; BAD rights access
B004Q3RDUW|5.0|This is the book which will give you the best understanding of the recent history and culture in Afghanistan. It should be required reading in all high school curriculums.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The Bourne series delivers yet another bit of intrigue, scientific bio breakthroughs, and intertwines the players.<br />I'm waiting for the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you should totally get this app. it is awesome! the minions are soooooo cute!I love this app so so much!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I got this to make it easier than looking up the Yahoo site everyday. However, it is always about 5-10 degrees higher than the Yahoo forecast. I don't see how they are so far off! I am going back to Yahoo forecast.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a great game that's fun to play.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the screen will lock up.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|It isnt very helpful...all it does is hook you up to a YouTube site showing a person playing selected levels. Well what good is that since the board is different each time? We know what the object of the level is! Also, it's silly to offer the &#34;guide&#34; when you cant even play the real game on the Kindle. If I had known you couldn't, I would have bought a different tablet honestly.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoy stories.  Which is what I so miss about most American sensationalistic fiction.  Just add a body part or some really horrible sexual killing that will infiltrate ur nightmares for the next week.<br />This was a story that illustrated the power of family and the fracturing of such.  I love Hosseini's use of words.  He paints pictures on the page and makes the experience real and personal.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|can't even play it. still shows it's downloading 2 hours later with 63mbps connection. tried twice before and it threw an error...disappoonted.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game  very fun and addicting. I could play this all day long if it was possible  hard to stop playing sometimes
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really makes me think . Love it know you will to. Try this game only if you have time because you will become entranced.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I only give the box set 4 stars because there is no option to ad the extra footage into the actual film as you see them on network television.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the search for hidden objects but feel the energy to play does not last long. too many quests and things to banish.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Different from what I expected really.  Great story,  Intense.  Special effects are fabulous.  All in all, a wonderful movie.  Highly recommend.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This book had me at the first chapter. My only complaint is that there were grammatical errors throughout the book. Not enough to distract from the story which is why I gave it 4 stars. The plot is well developed and the story is heartwarming.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an Amazoning game, see what I did there, but seriously it is free fun and a very appropriate game for everybody to play everyone should get this game!!!!!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I liked that it told the back story before the arrival of Dorothy and how the wicked witches came to be. Again a very entertaining movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Maggie Smith is wonderful.  The show gives you great character development and a real feel for life in Europe during the WWI era.
0802473156|5.0|I was feeling depressed in my marriage and my family doctor recommened this book. There are many ways to love and be loved.  This book helps you find your love language and that or your spouse.  It enables ou to work towards a stornger relationship.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's just a more mobile friendly version of twitter than using the browser.  7 more words required... crap crap crap
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|A well told story, but being the animal lover that I am, I found it heart breaking and often difficult to continue reading. Worthwhile on many levels, not the least being the knowledge and understanding the author shares about chimpanzees.  Wonderfully well-written.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|It's like the web version of the site just a lot more kindle friendly.  I think it is worth the couple bucks
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|At 60 plus this guys still have it!!!!! , its true they take borrowed from the past here and there , &#34;End of the Beginning&#34; have &#34;Black Sabbath&#34; (song) parts at first and at the end takes from &#34;dirty women&#34; , &#34;God is dead?&#34; takes from &#34;Hole in the sky&#34; ,  &#34;Zeitgeist&#34; is totally &#34;planet caravan&#34; etc. etc. but releasing an awesome album at this point is for them is a total achievement, Ozzy still have opened the window for another possible album following this one and this time including Ward, I hope they dont take long to do this , thats would be a better farewell for the Sabbath legacy<br /><br />Get This One<br /><br />HM
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A useful and easy to use app. It has maps videos forecasts and timely alerts. The videos cover diverse topics many are weather related, but not all.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great read in the Sigma series. I love the science and history you learn by reading James Rollins's books.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I've only made it thru chapter one, but I really like this game so far!<br />  It's easy to navigate &amp; you can expand the pictures to look for the hidden objects, plus the hint button refills quickly!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Taxing on one or two levels. Bring on the next levels. Entertained for an hour or two.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very fun to play. I love the item and skill customization available and variety of enemies. The only downside is the fact you only get three potions, and they take two hours to regen. But hey, it's a free game. They have to make money somehow.
0374533555|4.0|While some of the material in this book I found a little boring or overstated, I think that may have been because I was familiar with many of the psychology experiments and results that Kahneman discusses. However, if you are unfamiliar with psychology and the applications of the mind to real-life, I would definitely recommend this book!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is really really good app that is FREE and about NEMO i LOVE NEMO and its not last at all and has great graphics.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I wish he was still alive, he is a great actor. The new guy who replaced him sucks, and seem weak! Andy W is the one and only orginal Spartacus! I miss him dearly! God bless and RIP ANDY W!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|It was perfect, came on time and fit my Kindle well. It was a lot cheaper than the ones I saw in the store.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|good movie, sad! Love it!  I would totally buy it on Blue-ray if amazon had it for a cheaper price.
B00471JSR4|4.0|This was an excellent replacement blu-ray disc due to the fact that an earlier blu-ray print, which seems to be out-of-print, was lost in my move from CA to NC.  Sorry if I don't review the film here or the quality of it, for I do not consider myself a film reviewer.  I hope that many others can write better reviews than mine.
B005K0S2SW|5.0|The best I can explain it is a more funky, jazzy version of the old Tower of Power horn section that combines more soul and rock into the mix than I have ever heard before. The horns start of blasting in &#34;Backjump&#34; goes on to a more R&B groove in &#34;Encore&#34; back to funky jazz with &#34;For True&#34; that has lead with a killer trumpet in the lead on to another R&B groove in &#34;Do to Me&#34; followed by a New Orleans Jazz flavored &#34;Lagniappe Part 1&#34; . Then more Rap inspired &#34;The Craziest Thing&#34; on to &#34;Dumaine St.&#34; which to me has a feel of the band Chicago. Then &#34;Mrs Orleans&#34; a love song to the city to &#34;Nervis&#34; and &#34; Roses&#34; the most rock inspired jazz on the CD. Then down the stretch with a slower tempo groove &#34;Big 12&#34;, &#34;Unc&#34; and the slow R&B jam &#34;Then There was You&#34; with Ledisi on vocals. Finally it leave you a taste on New Orleans with &#34;Lagniappe Part 2&#34;. If you want the next wave in Jazz buy this CD.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|You will get so involved with the story of every character. You will cry, laugh and feel part of the story.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Enjoyable movie. Typical popcorn movie. Even in a less significant role, Ewin Mcgregor, stole the show in his scenes. His charismatic sarcasm helped the movie. The actor who played \\"Jack\\", did a pretty good job. The movie falls in the \\"rental\\" category for me.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This was a gift for a very special loved one! She was so thrilled as was I. The product arrived in a timely manner in great condition! Great seller. I would not hesitate to use again.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Wonderful self reflection and guide to a better way to live. It should be required reading and study for youths.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|This song always puts a smile on my face! Granted, I think it's hard for anyone to sing a song about being happy, and then not be happy, but this cheerful song makes me thing of the movie, which I also loved! Congrats, Pharell, you've done it again. I'll probably be buying the Despicable Me 2 Soundtrack, since I own the first one. Oh, and as a FYI: I have no children. LOL. That's right, I'm a grown woman that loves some minions! Seriously, try and see if you can listen to this song without smiling at least once, haha.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Fast, easy read with some food for thought.  You will love Mma Rawotse's character.<br />Looking forward to reading volume 2.
B002IJQ3E8|5.0|Well ladies and gents, I'm gonna make it simple for everyone. Volbeat has something for everybody. I am loving it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is wonderful. It is super addicting, fun and free. The best combination. I would recommend that you buy it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I love movies in this time warp. Love the gods..thats why i purchses percey jacksons set as well. you word reqirement still sucks
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a really simple but very heartwarming story.  I would recommend this as a family movie or a mother/daughter movie night.
B004PYD77K|1.0|i bought this and had to send it back because it was the wrong region so i have not seen the movie to rate it
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a steal when I picked it up, but I'd still recommend this set for any Batman fan out there.  The films are well done and still easy to follow for someone who may not be as familiar with the comics.  The quality is amazing.
B005LAII0I|3.0|its ok, glad to have it in my collection of dvds...just adding more dvd to my collection that is not a shoot them up kinda movie
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was great!  I must admit that I'm a little biased because I was in choir when I was younger, but I loved this movie!  The songs are fun and the dancing is entertaining.  May not be appropriate for younger audiences.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|i liked, I am a channing tatum fan and wanted to add it to my collection. it was good<br />thank you
B007JOM0GC|3.0|This might have been a better purchase if so many of the tracks hadn't been overplayed by the radio :P  I'm still glad I have it.
B0053FANQS|5.0|i liked it. i am collecting all the fast and furious movies. So far i loved them all except the second one
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I had no idea what to expect from this movie and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I had tried reading some of the books but I found them quite dry.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like how TWC gives points now when you check in. Some are hard to find but I like the new format.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Gotye has a lot of very interesting songs on this album.  I like the difference in their sound as compared to a lot of the mainstream music out there.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|The film kept you guessing a little but I was bummed when the good witch was disposed of by Liam Nilson's wife in the Taken film series.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|If you are a fan of Queens of the Stone Age, it is a must buy. Great guitar rifts and the tracks have a nice rhythm.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I want to see the green lantern meet iron man.  it will be a test to see whose ego wins.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|How good was this film? Was it believable? Would I recommend it? How about this for summing it up, \\"SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!!\\"
B003EY62II|2.0|Our kids didn't even like this flick.  Go rent the cartoon series.  They'll enjoy that more than watching this movie.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I have always enjoyed Star Trek, but I would never classify myself as a die hard fan. For this reason, I found Into Darkness to be a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />In fact, it inspired me to write a blog post about facing challenges:<br />[...]<br /><br />There were a few moments that I wanted to tell others in the theater that my name was Jon Harrison, and show them all my driver's license as proof, but I managed to be content with laughing at dialog that no one else understood the humor behind.<br /><br />That being said, if the first reboot of Star Trek left you disappointed, give Into Darkness a try - it just might change your mind.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Some decent performances by the actors and an interesting story line.  I'm hoping they make a sequel - hey, they did...
