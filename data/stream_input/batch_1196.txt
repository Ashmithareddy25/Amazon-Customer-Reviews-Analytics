0061537934|1.0|The only reason I got past the first few pages of this sentimental wallow was that it was our book club choice (curses be upon she who chose it!)  After I'd waded through to the excruciatingly twee ending, I checked the reviews, and was struck by the fact that I could find not one single published review by a known critic - only 'customer reviews', the vast majority uncritical.  This alone confirmed by belief that this is not a book to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately it was not even a book I could enjoy.  Others have noted the turgid prose, the emotional manipulation, and the shallow characterization. I have a new grouse; one of the things this dog must have watched on TV (well. someone must have slipped in a DVD) was 'The Secret', as he apparently swallowed whole its inane belief that anyone can have whatever they want simply by wishing for it fervently enough.  This is denoted in the book by the oft-repeated meaningless mantra 'That which you manifest is before you'.  At one point (p.124) the dog narrator strongly implies that if only Eve had had the right, positive attitude, she need not have died of cancer.  Silly girl.  (If anyone is interested in statistics that blow this particularly pernicious 'blame the victim' philosophy out of the water, read 'Bright Sided' by Barbara Ehrenreich.) Once I'd spotted the association with 'The Secret', I realized that it permeated the book, and it became more and more repellent.  The ending, when (spoiler alert) the dog's wish to become human is granted, symbolizes the ultimate triumph of this idiotic worldview.  You have only to wish, and your desires will be granted!  Yes, I know it's just fiction.  But I can't help but believe that Garth Stein was using it as a vehicle to push what are presumably his own beliefs.  And I don't like them one bit.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Like most people who purchased \\"Live at River Plate\\", I am also an AC/DC fanatic.  I have bought literally everything they have ever made over the years, and as far as Live DVD's go, this one is superior to the others.    My favorite DVD prior to this was \\"Live at Donnington\\".  The crowd in England was electric and MASSIVE!  They were on their \\"A\\" game.  Oh, I'm a fan of the old Bon Scott Live DVD as well.  I mean it's AC/DC we're talking about.  What's not to love?    What puts this latest effort above the rest is, well, geez...I can't put my finger on it.  The band sounds great.  They are right on every song.  The crowd is absolutely amazing.  They are so fired up!!!  They start Jumping at the first chord of \\"Rock and Roll Train\\" and just never stop.  Obviously anyone can get nitpicky about what songs they chose to play and stuff like that, but man, this thing is filmed wonderfully and truly shows the raw unabated power that is AC/DC.  No other band on the planet even comes close...not even in the same league.      If you're questioning buying this, just go on line and view the video for Rock and Roll Train or Dirty Deeds Live at River Plate.  I guarentee you will scoop this up in seconds.    Trust me...get it.  So much better than \\"No Bull\\" or anything else they've done in years.  They wanted this one, and they nailed it!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|The book is one of my favorites. And I loved getting a refresher on the story I love so much. As far as book to movie goes this is pretty good.  But, if you are one of those people that examine every part of a movie that is from a book than you probably shouldn't see any movie that you read the book first :)  Problem soved.

1451629184|5.0|I felt so sorry for her reading her story. A girl should never experience what she did. I learned things I have never heard a man would want a women  do and I am 54. I think she did a great job explaining what happen.  The girls kepted her insane and with him at the same time. I don't want to think what would have happened to her if she hadn't had the 2 girls. At the same time she could never try to escape because he had her so brainwashed that he would hurt them.    I wish her and her family the best and healing with time.  I hate she went through this but I am so glad she wrote the book and I bought it. She answered a lot of questions for me.
B005BQTUVI|4.0|I have reviewed \\"Mimic\\" before but here's the bluray review.  \\"Mimic looks amazing on bluray.  Filmic, light grain , and terrific color saturation.  The SD version of the movie had the quality of a TV movie; artificiallly brightened and color timed...this is the definitive version,  The \\"Director's Cut\\" mainly includes additional character bits and some bits of plot.  These add texture to an already great film.  The 1080p image is superb, but the sound is amazing...pulsing, ambient, and loud...this version is miles above the SD version.  Highly recommended.

038572179X|5.0|It took me a little bit to get into. Eventually, it becomes a page turner. Then it slows down. It reconvenes to build the suspense. Then it picks up again. It is like a baroque concerto: allegro-andante-allegro. But with more than just 3 movements. As a whole, everything makes sense.     If this book doesn't become a classic, which one will? Time will tell.    I saw the DVD the day after I finish reading. It is not bad, but the end is slightly different. I prefer the book's end better. The last two pages of the book are unforgettable.

I suggest the fan base of the initial plot lines get together online and finish it ourselves.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|The latest edition of X-Men films, \\"X-Men: First Class,\\" is inspired by the 2006-2007 comic that showcased the beginnings of its most famous members beginning with Professor X, Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Jean Grey. However, in this film, the team roster includes Professor X, Magneto, Beast, Mystique, Banshee, Havok, Darwin, Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, and Angel (no, not that Angel - Angel Salvadore a.k.a. Tempest in the comics). Do not let the huge cast fool you, though; this film belongs to Charles Xavier/ Professor X (James McAvoy), and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender)! Although not accurate to all of the origins in the comic, \\"First Class\\" still successfully captures what makes the X-Men so great (and this coming from a guy who prefers DC Comics)! It does not take a philosophy major to tell you that the X-Men are an allegory for race relations, and this film - taking place first during the Nazis' cruel rule and genocide over the Jews in 1944, and then during the turbulent times of 1962 when race relations were at their most volatile - perfectly executes this allegory with its James Bond-type style, solid story and near-faultless character development.<br /><br />  My first question when asking wondering about this film was, \\"Is it canon with the first three X-Men films?\\" The answer is a definite \\"yes\\" - especially with two particular surprise cameos in the film. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when the movie started because of the recycling of young Lensherr's first display of his magnetic powers (as seen in Bryan Singer's 2000 film [[ASIN:B001PPGAJE X-Men [Blu-ray]]]), but, fortunately, that is just the beginning of his - and the other mutants' - journey. I haven't been a big X-Men comic fan so I wasn't disappointed by the discrepancies of character origins. For those of you who are fans of the comic, trust me, the origins are greatly altered. One of the great additions to this film was Kevin Bacon as main villain Sebastian Shaw. Bacon has been in his share of hits as well as stinkers, and in most of those films, he's played a good guy. This time, his role proves two things. First, he can act, which is something most critics could tell you. Second, he should play a bad guy more often! Bacon's Shaw is a true villain whose mutant power makes him seem almost indestructible, and therefore, makes him a truly formidable foe. His inevitable defeat is carefully crafted and I think very well-executed. On the other hand, while January Jones' Emma Frost fits the physical traits of the character, her mercenary-like attitude and complex personality are not displayed so well. Many critics have panned Jones' performance, but I also blame the writers who merely didn't give her many good lines - or a history, for that matter - to work with. Still, who knows? Hopefully Frost's history will be explored in the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />One of the best aspects to this film is the relationship between Lensherr/Magneto and Xavier/Prof. X. One of the most powerful, well-acted scenes in the film is when Xavier is trying to teach Lensherr how to hone his magnetic power. Whereas Lensherr had merely used his anger to unleash his power, Xavier teaches him that finding the balance of anger and serenity can help intensify his power, making it possible to lift heavier objects. When Lensherr's memory is revealed to Xavier and the audience, the bond between McAvoy and Fassbender is both poignant and an inspired piece of acting; it captures the \\"bromance\\" relationship between the two in a touching way. And that's what this film is based in: the deep relationships between the characters. Their love, their fear, their anger; all of these emotions are what drive the characters in their actions as well as their relationships (i.e., Magneto and Prof. X; Mystique and Beast; Shaw and Magneto), and the writers (and director Matthew Vaughn) stylishly pulled it off. Bryan Singer tried to achieve this same tone in his2000 debut of the franchise. However, while the original \\"X-Men\\" was good, it was not as good as this. I think it is because of the focus of characters. In the original, the main focus was on Rogue and Wolverine, and in this, the focus is on Professor X and Magneto. While Rogue and Wolverine have interesting backgrounds - particularly Wolverine who is practically immortal because of his regenerative healing - the two characters were not written well. There were so many aspects of their histories that could have been explored but were not (fortunately, Wolverine later got his own origin movie). In \\"First Class,\\" X and Magneto were focused on just right while also introducing the other assorted characters. There's something I love when the audience is given a glimpse into how a once-good person turns evil. These kinds of stories remind the viewer that anyone could go down this route because most people have a past that is not always pretty; and Lensherr's past is particularly horrifying. \\"First Class\\" simply gets it right!<br /><br />  I have heard that this is the beginning of a new film trilogy and I surely hope so because this is by far the best of the franchise to date. I'm going to say that this is the best comic adaptation of the year! It balances the drama, action, humor and romance in all the right ways. Plus, let's face it; the explanation of Xavier's paralysis is so much better in this film than in the comic. This is one of those films that will be a hard act to follow, but it's finally a proper film for a great franchise. Now, if they could only get my two favorites - Daredevil and The Punisher - right!

030788743X|5.0|Five years ago, OASIS, virtual reality creator and billionaire, James Halliday dead. Before Halliday's passing, he offered up a huge challenge. The first gamer to locate three hidden keys and unlock several gates will find a hidden room filled with gold beyond their wildest dreams. As the years passed, less and less people attempted to find the hidden room. Only the most, extreme and dedicated gamers still tried. Eighteen year old, Wade Watts was one of them. Things quickly picked up when Wade was the first one to locate the Copper Key. Soon afterwards, gamers were logging on again, in hopes of finding the lost treasure. As if playing Dungeons and Dragons, quoting movie lines from eighties movies and avoiding traps was not enough. Wade has to deal with the Sixers. A group of bots that hope to find the treasure first and will do anything to get it. Luckily for Wade, he is joined by two other players, character name \\"Aech\\", his friend and \\"Art3mis\\", a girl.<br /><br />Avid gamer fans, geeks, and fans of the eighties will all fall in love with Ready Player One. Instantly, I was head over heels in love with this book. Ready Player One is like watching VH1's I Love the Eighties. It features all the best things about the eighties. Mr. Cline really did a good job on this book. I saw and experienced everything though, Wade's shoes. I was born in the eighties, so this was a fun book for me. I did not become a gamer until later. The first gaming system I played was Nintendo. I don't play so much on the gaming system as I do play computer games. My husband and I like to play World of Warcraft. As I was reading this book, I would tell myself, that I would only read just one more page and soon one page turned into several until I was finished reading this book. Ready Player One is a recommended read!

B004EPYZZI|4.0|Ever since I saw the trailer for this film, I've wanted to see it. It's got great actors in it and I remember when I heard in the news about the true story of Bethany Hamilton being attacked in 2003 and losing an arm. Some may be put off by the fact that this film does have a strong presence of Christianity in it. And most would be correct to feel that way as films made with Christianity as its base (i.e. [[ASIN:B001HN68ZU Fireproof [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B002EYLOE6 Facing the Giants [Blu-ray]]]) have been a little too cheesy and/or too preachy. I'm not much of a religious person, but with films like [[ASIN:B003JBHRQW To Save a Life [Blu-ray]]] and especially this one being released, the film production is improving. Don't get me wrong, though, just because this film does have Christianity as just one of its facets, it's not what the entire film revolves around. \\"Soul Surfer\\" hits all the right marks in acting (well, except maybe Carrie Underwood; one can tell she's not a professional actress and it should stay that way), direction (by surfer Sean McNamara), story, pacing, setting, and -- most important with a film like this -- surfing. Hunt, Quaid and Sorbo all give great performances, but the best here -- as it should be -- is AnnaSophia Robb. This film proves that she is star material! The film is inspirational, showcasing the potential of the best in people. It sort of reminds me of that famously great quote from Jor-El to his son Kal-El (Superman) in the original [[ASIN:B000K4X5XA Superman - The Movie [Blu-ray]]]: \\"They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way.\\" Bethany Hamilton wishes to be that \\"light\\" to show people she meets \\"the way.\\" That's definitely not such a bad thing and with this film to help spread her message of a happy, giving, soulful life, that's not so bad either.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|As much as i like the movie, i hate the quality of the transfer. Running at 1080p off a Vivitek Projector on an 80 inch high contrast screen, i have to say the movie looks very grainy and not sharp enough. Comparing this with the Blu Ray of Transformers, this is just devastatingly inferior. The special features are nice and the digital copy is a great bonus though. For the price i paid for this, i dont have huge complaints, its just that i expected the sound and picture quality to be better than it turned out to be.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North & South is a tale of people shaped by a time and place. There is first Margaret Hale, the compassionate, strong willed daughter of a country churchman; Mr. Hale, the aforementioned former pastor who, moved by doubt and conscience, resigns his post in the rural south of England and moves his family to the bleak, northern industrial town of Milton; John Thornton, stern-faced master of a cotton mill who, driven by family tragedy, strives to maximize the ever important bottom line without destroying his workers in the process -- all for the sake of the business, of course; Mrs. Thornton, John's mother, who is as fierce an advocate for her son as she is a ruthless capitalist; Nicholas, the determined union boss who sees the need -- and opportunity -- for improvement; his daughter, Bess, who has paid the ultimate price for the industrial revolution; etc.<br /><br />This is very much a human story, a story of people separated by a vast chasm of varied experience and situation, who must, through bitter trial and even at times against their will, come to recognize at least a modicum of virtue in their fellow man's opposing viewpoint. Thus, as it begins, to Mr. Thornton the smoker who endangers the entire mill and its hundreds of workers by smoking amidst highly flammable conditions, is a threat who must be dealt with expeditiously and fiercely; to Miss Hale, he is an unarmed man who daren't defend himself, and the beating of him is an exercise in excess and cruelty. To Nicholas and his fellow mill workers, the master's claim that there is no money to meet their demands is proof of duplicity and further abuse; and, to Mr. Thornton, it is the reality of his world. There are at work in this film several competing factors -- the generous nature of slow, easy-going rural life contrasted with the cold realities of a fast, hard industrial world; the bottom line for a business as opposed to the comfort and welfare of its employees; even the moderate climate of the south versus the chill of the north.<br /><br />As these many, competing themes come into play, friendships are formed, lives are destroyed, hearts are broken, and life goes on as it always has. This is a story of people in the midst of turmoil. It is bleak, terrible and hopeless at points; and for all that it probably ends on too optimistic a note to ring wholly true. But that is not a bad thing -- after portraying so much suffering and pain, it is a relief to have a happy ending (or as happy as one can expect, given the circumstances).<br /><br />This is a phenomenal series; the story is, as you may have guessed from my description thus far, agonizingly good, but the screenplay, acting, costumes and settings are all perfect. The two main stars are phenomenal, but so too are the supporting characters; everyone becomes who he or she is supposed to be. 5/5 stars -- a great story perfectly executedll of the north.

B001GXF2YY|4.0|[[ASIN:B001GXF2YY Angels Flight: A Harry Bosch Novel]]<br /><br />Yes, I read this book immediately after its publication in 1999.<br /><br />I've been grousing about the prices Amazon is charging for Kindle e-books lately. Amazon originally promoted better, lower prices for those who opted to get Kindles. Better prices were said to be resulting from lower (almost NO) publication costs since, after scaning a book once, it could be delivered to thousands of buyers with NO ADDITIONAL COSTS TO AMAZON. They promised Kindle prices for current publications would be normally $9.99 and only occasionally $12 - $14.<br /><br />Now, first editions are priced STARTING at around $14.00 and up.<br /><br />That's one \\"kettle of fish\\". This offering of \\"Angels Flight\\" is something else altogether: THIS BOOK WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 1999 AND IS STILL BEING OFFERED AT $9.99 whereas other 1999 books are normally priced to Kindle customers at $7.99 OR LESS!!!<br /><br />Can't help but question this 73 year-old man's wisdom of purchasing a Kindle to try to economize on my propensity as a voracious reader!!

B004EPYZZ8|4.0|This is one of those films I was somewhat reluctant to see. I knew of the story of Bethany Hamilton, because I remember when the shark attack on her happened. I was half expecting this to be a extremely sad and depressing film, which I don't enjoy watching. This film is far from that though. Despite the tragic event it's based on, the film is very uplifting, has a lot of heart, and yet it's entertaining. It's been a few days since I watched it, but the film still remains in my mind. Few films have that lasting effect on me. I was quite touched by the closeness of the Hamilton Family too, and Bethany's beautiful outlook on people and life.     It's pretty clear now that the religious message of the film, and the families reliance on religion, has rubbed a few reveiwers the wrong way. As a guy who hasn't taken a step inside a church in years, and who still has no plans to anytime soon, I'm quite perplexed by the negative reactions. First of all, the film is about a person and a family that is deeply religious. Religion, like it or not, clearly plays a huge part in these people everyday lives. And I don't think Bethany ever claimed to be perfect. Sure she defied her parents by going out late before the attack, but she was still very young and still a kid. I think people need to lighten-up with that. I didn't think the film tried to knock-me-over-the-head with religion, it was just a part of who the family is and how they chose to deal with a tragedy that may have left a majority of people in a funk for years and years. Heck that's the one part of religion I actually respect. I mean I can be as cynical as anyone, but this seemed a story as much about love and perseverance as anything else. I don't know how to not like it.

0143118706|4.0|I think this book is not only important for women who fall victim to the \\"fairy tale\\" view of marriage. I also think it is important for men as well to understand the history behind marriage. Most of us engage in traditions blindly without ever questioning it's validity. Once we do, we start to realize that traditions are nothing more than man made rituals that only hold weight because we choose to agree that it's heavy.     Elizabeth did a great job by injecting her views on marriage, what she was going through being put in a position to marry again against her instinct to do so and exploring the idea of marriage within other cultures. Not only was it a great read, it was an interesting read.

Did I mention NEW.<br />The writing - Smooth, no dragging, no gaps, well told story that keeps your interest past the end & looking forward to the next book.<br />If you like JR Ward, Lara Adrian, Jim Butcher books, you need to try this series.

1416596097|1.0|I had never read Le Carre before, but had obviously heard of him.  So, when I saw this book lying around for the taking, I picked it up.  Le Carre does an admirable job of developing characters and place, but ultimately they go nowhere.  It's like Le Carre threw up his hands and wanted to be done with this book.  The book winds up being a shameful work of anti-American political correctness, which is so rampant these days that it equates to nothing more than an overdone cliche.      One final bone to pick - Le Carre himself must have known prior to release that this was far from a strong effort, so it falls into the category of something hastily thrown together with the intent to ride on the coattails of his previous successes (think Stephen King lately).  That is one of the biggest insults an author can hurl at his readers, and one of the quickest ways to lose a good reputation.    Being one who is always up for a good read, I'd eventually like to check out some of Le Carre's earlier works, but after this, it will take a while...

I remember being completely envious of certain aspects of Angela's life: I coveted her boots, swooned over Jordan (like every other girl my age), and reveled in the fantasy of having such a close-knit group of friends as Ricky, Rayanne, and Sharon. At the same time, I understood her angst, her uncertainty with her place in the world, and the way she lived inside her head a lot of the time.    I am currently re-watching all 19 episodes (I have the older version of the boxset without all the bells and whistles) and it is not only bringing me back, but it is making realize just how smart this show really is.  Because, not only the writing for the teenagers, but also the conflicts between Patty and Graham are so accurately portrayed that it gives me the shivers.  I have been married for several years and been through a lot of ups and downs in my marriage.  I can say in all sincereity that Patty and Graham's relationship is incredibly true and honest. This is a new aspect that of course I was not aware of when I watched the show live on ABC. I suspect that the reason why this show was cancelled was more to do with how uncomfortable it made parents feel about thier own marriages and lives, coming to terms with growing older, etc.  I doubt it was due to the drama with Angela and her friends as much as everyone thinks.       This is such a great depiction of a real marriage (well, a real, troubled marriage, I guess)  Unlike Angela and co., who analyzed everything ad nauseum, Patty and Graham tend to gloss over their feelings and instincts...they are able to distract themselves with work and the kids and sweep the problems with their marriage under therug. They stuggle to find happiness as adults approaching middle age, both within themselves, as a family, and within the marriage.  They seek out their true identities and realize that they have lost little pieces of themselves over the years, without even realizing it.  While I am a good decade younger than the characters' ages on the show, I completely relate to them and how they are presented.      In all, this is a timeless show no matter what the viewers' age.  As long as humans are watching it will never be obsolete.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|There isn't much I can say about the series that hasn't already been said... it's great and the character interactions make it a joy to watch. Season 1 was a great introduction to the characters and, in my opinion, it only gets better. They've built up a great head of steam with this show and, again in my opinion, every season is a must see. Now into its fourth season the show shows no sign or slowing down. I've got season 2 shipping right now and season 3 on pre-order. Looking forward to enjoying them again and again. :)    That said I'll touch on the media and packaging... it is also great. Three single sided DVDs with nice artwork on the top and in a well designed DVD case. It isn't rocket science but I still run into sets that are poorly constructed or obviously had corners cut at the expense of quality. This isn't one of them.
B004RPUGAS|3.0|The setting is 1935 Missippi in a small town divided by race. A trial pits justice against bias. A black man stands falsely accused of raping a white woman with a dubious reputation- there is no evidence except her testimony backed by that of her idle father.<br /><br />Tom Robinson stands to lose his life if the conviction stands. Atticus Finch is a lawyer motivated by justice despite the culture of bigotry he grew up in.<br /><br />Atticus must fight the state's case which is backed by no physical evidence or corroborative testimony. Tom Robinson's good character seems to count little in the eyes of the town as the dubious character of the alleged victim's father is overlooked. The father, Tom Ewell, testifies and is quickly discredited by Atticus.<br /><br />Despite the conviction of Tom Robinson, Tom Ewell, the victim's father is down in the dumps...quite literally since that is where he lives...in the city dump...white trash perhaps in a very real sense. The angry Ewell seeks revenge on the kindly Atticus.<br /><br />Perhaps predictably, the black man is killed in a fusillade of bullets as he tries to escape a work farm pending an appeal which may have succeeded.<br /><br />MOCKING BIRD- in an apparent nod to Faulkner- has a dark id force residing in the house next to Atticus'. Boo Radley is the son who disappeared twenty five years before as the apparent victim of a repressive religious upbringing that stresses fundamentalist pietism.<br /><br />Boo communicates throughout the book with furtive glances from his window and gifts left for Atticus' children. A ghost of a man is Boo when reality should have made him a sociopath.<br /><br />MOCKING BIRD is narrated from the point of view of Scout who apparently learned to read at four on the litigation weary lap of her father when most children have bedtime stories. Scout by the second grade describes the local judge as speaking \\"ex cathedra\\" to the court which is amazing since most adults have no idea what that means. Scout's account of life in the town is as languid as a hot summer in Dixie and at times as confusing as well...<br /><br />Would you say the Finches have a Incestuous Streak? Aunty said no, that's where we got our small hands and feet. p 147.<br /><br />Perhaps this is the way the family really thought so I guess confusion makes the tale authentic.<br /><br />MOCKING BIRD was written in 1960 the same year that Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY appeared. 1960 was a year of social convulsion in America with the throes of desegregation rocking the (un) reconstructed South.<br /><br />History helped write both books. The real author of both books was as much the Zeitgeist of 1960 as Steinbeck or Lee. In TRAVELS we find Steinbeck talking to three characters picked up on a long road trip through the South that began in the East and was quickly becoming rushed and boring as the novel withers.<br /><br />One character was a kind black sharecropper, another was an idiot white bigot while the last was a young black radical...all in an almost movie like sequence. A real account with a fiction like reality to it. MOCKING is fiction that seems fictional indeed.<br /><br />In MOCKING BIRD we find a lawyer strangely removed from the culture he grew up in and unmoved by the passions of ego, angst or the lust created by loneliness. A kind of secular saint who turns his cheek to all and answers only with wise sayings and dry wit.<br /><br />Atticus is no Huey Long being ruthless to the ruthless in the name of the working class. Atticus seems strangely eastern in the dark land of Faulkner and decayed houses...he is no sweating redneck messiah as Govenor Long was but an abstraction with no real faults except perhaps his idolatry of the law.<br /><br />Atticus is a hollow icon incapable of true good because there is no struggle with evil in him...Atticus is programmed for justice.<br /><br />Atticus' South is only a New England with humidity...its soul is hollow because it lacks thecreaking floorboards of dark carnality. There is not enough rot in this book to make it great; it can only preach to us from a pulpit or as a footnote to TV documentaries on Civil Rights.<br /><br />MOCKING BIRD cannot see into the dark souls behind the white hoods.<br /><br />Would the issue of justice had been less if Tom Robinson had been a poor white falsely accused of raping a wealthy white woman or a communist union organizer murdered in the cotton fields of the anti-labor South? Would the accolades given this book on the back cover from newspapers and librarians been less if the economic power of anti-union media and the political bias of the middle class been questioned?<br /><br />MOCKING BIRD was a good book made great only by the Tsunami Zeitgeist of 1960.creaking floorboards of dark carnality.

1594744769|2.0|This book had potential. However, it left me glad I was finished. It was too weird. The premise was brilliant; using photos to add to the text. But the story just didn't grab me. It was too dark, yet silly. I don't know how to describe it. But I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it.

B004QYTRRS|3.0|This film had a somewhat interesting premise, and the cast was a good one (Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Timothy Dalton), but somewhere along the way, the screenplay (written by the director, Christopher McQuarrie and one or two other people) got muddled, and the result is a mess that had potential to be a mega-hit. A rushed production schedule (shot in just 58 days) is partly to blame for this film that ultimately does not know what it's trying to be: a comedy, drama, action or suspense. I had a bit of a hard time understanding the plot of the film. Timothy Dalton was under-used as the police inspector. Such a good actor reduced to a cameo. Shame. SPOILER!!! Why the hell go through this charade, only for Frank to know the combination of the safe? And how the hell did Frank know the combination if he wasn't Pearce? He says he isn't, but he is. MAKE UP YOUR FRICKIN' MIND ALREADY. And who the devil was Rufus Sewell supposed to be, if not Pearce? SPOILER OVER!!! Numerous plot holes. Avoid this film and stick with \\"North By Northwest.\\" Now, THERE'S a movie...with a plot, suspense, romance and intrigue lurking around every corner.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I fell in love with Percy Jackson and his friends as soon as i looked at the percy jackson books so i did not doubt that the heroes of olympus would fail my expectations. Unfortunatley it did. I loved the book and plot but some things were not that great. like the fact that Jason and Piper have no personality. And that piper whines sooooo much. She also cannot stop thinkind about jason. i secretly hope that jason had a girlfriend before his memory was wiped.   Anyway i loved the percy jackson books but not so much this book. Hopefully th son of neptune is better.

0679735909|4.0|This book first came across my radar after seeing the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow.  That alone should have been reason enough for me to stay as far away as possible from the novel.  But, something about the premise intrigued me, and I finally got around to reading it.  Possession is wonderful from beginning to end. I was engaged with the characters both from the past and the present and I often felt as if I was on the edge of my seat from the suspense of the literary discovery and who may ultimately benefit from it.  I also enjoyed the poetry and fairy stories, even though both of these literary genres are far afield of my usual tastes.  I rewatched the movie after reading the book - it's still awful!

Also as someone else pointed out, the Kindle edition is awful, avoid it altogether.

B0012GN47C|5.0|Somehow I'll never quite understand why Carlos Santana took such a pounding from critics and his audience following this first trio of albums. It's true he did begin making a series of albums that explored his jazzier leanings with people such as John McLaughlin,Alice Coltrane and Flora Purim. Than again it wasn't as if albums such as [[ASIN:B0000062FL Abraxas]] didn't have strong jazz elements built into them. For a man whose guitar style resembles few outside of John Coltrane's sax style it's important to note that a base of funk and jazz were always at the core of Santana's sound. That Carlos himself elected to expand on that as the 70's progressed said a lot for his musical integrity. Even when the \\"psychedelic stew\\" that Santana was originally mixed into had gradually faded as the 70's soldiered on. But jazz-funk was happening and that's what Santana by and large chose to embrace here. Bringing in Leon Ndugu Chancler on drums and keyboardist Tom Coster from that particular world we were reminded that Santana's albums were generally released in trilogies. Or groups of three similarly themed albums coming right after another. And if Carlos had anything to do with it funk would be a big part of his mid/late 70's trilogy of which this was a part of.<br /><br />  \\"Dance Sister Dance\\" is about as catchy a beginning as one could ask. Even more strong involved with the salsa-rock style than anything on the first Santana albums and in many ways more pop oriented it did let people know what they were getting. Because Santana's music usually always comes out of jazzy improvisational jamming \\"Take Me With You\\" and the Mexican folk/jazz-rock fusion hybrid of \\"Gitano\\" were good for the band because it put them into sync more with the musicians than popular tastes,making sure they'd have some timelessness. Also the funk the present here is of different varities and that's important too. \\"Let Me\\" is very uptempo,filled with lightening speed clavinets,vocal harmonies and percussion. Actually my own favorite number here is the one a lot of people seem to despise. \\"Tell Me Are You Tired\\" is elegantly produced sophistifunk-pop friendly,multi faceted and with very clean rhythmic lines. On \\"Europa (Earth's Cry Heavens Smile\\" the focus is on Carlos and his playing and,as usual he really takes his technique of making the few notes he plays really wiggle and wobble to the next level on this beautifully melodic piece. The album concludes with \\"Let It Shine\\"-funk in all it's splendor with phat synth lines,JB style rhythm guitar,tons of wah wah and a great gospel like chorus.<br /><br />  That Santana elected to rejuvenate his sound by embracing the musically expansive genre of funk as opposed to making some type of progressive rock album (as a lot of psychedelic acts tended to do at this point) said a lot about how much of a jazz ethic Carlos had. Not only on his own but by association. It's kind of too bad that,even though this was by and large a commercial success it didn't exactly signal the beginning of any hugely successful era for him either. The trilogy this album began didn't exactly progress as successfully as his first and resulted in a similar holding pattern by the end of the decade. At least on the commercial side anyway. Musically with each release,Santana was expanding musically and spiritually. And while everyone was welcomed and encouraged to come along on this creative journey,the musical divisions created as funk began to extend into the disco era begin to derail the runaway fright train Santana's music was starting to become. But no matter how you cut it this represents Santana at their strongest and is one of their highest quality and vital albums following their original trilogy.avinets,vocal harmonies and percussion.

0307946711|2.0|I saw the trailer for the movie and thought the book is always better so I'll read the book first.  BAD MISTAKE!!!  I have never been sooooo disappointed and angry with a book before.  I don't even want to watch the movie anymore!!!    ***SPOILER ALERT***  I only remember one other time when I was sooooo disappointed and angry with entertainment, it was the series finale to the tv-series MEDIUM.  This book gave me the same awful feeling.  I enjoyed the book from the beginning all the way to year 2002-2003, I forget when exactly.  But it's the year that they kill off the main character for NO GOOD FRAKKING REASON!  It was like the author didn't know what to do w/ the protagonists anymore so he decided to just OFF one of them to give it more drama.  It was like the movie CITY OF ANGELS with Meg Ryan all over again.  It caught me so off guard and I stared at the book blankly in total shock.  In fact, I kind of wanted to throw it across the room, but it was on my ipad via my Nook app so no throwing allowed.   Emma and Dexter were such great deep characters and the dialog was always witty and LOL funny.  And the long dragged out story of the friendship/relationship between the two was heart warming and heart wrenching at the same time.  And then the author just sort of got lazy or his publishers demanded some kind of dramatic and shocking twist.  NOT EVEN close to being WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  NOT EVEN!  Sorry, I sound bitter, don't I?  *sigh*

0553801473|5.0|This book is a fantastic continuation of the Song of Ice and Fire. Never in this series have I felt a desire to skip pages, never, ever. (not even in A Feast for Crows, probably because I am much less jaded than Bucky Jones). I can't wait to read Book 6 when it is released, it will be mostly because of the same eager anticipation I felt after AGoT, ACoK or ASoS... This plot has overachieved and began to evolve in AFFC and it feels as though Martin has decided to start bringing it all together in ADWD. He begins adding new characters 5 books into the story and is carefull to spend enough time on their mini-stories so that they can become as amazing as the characters the reader has followed thus far. Brilliant!!! Some may end up being pawns (obviously) and draw mixed emotions from the reader. Some of them are so curious (Quentyn Martel) that they stop the reader in their tracks. When I turned the page and saw the chapter title \\"the Spurned Suitor\\" or \\"Victarion\\", I could hardly wait to get ito them... What about Bran? I'd wait six hundered years and read a hunderd SOIAF books, just to find out what Brienne said to get out of the noose. Where's Rickon? As usual GRRM leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />I have been following the thread since the completion of this book on the Web, and heard of how GRRM's script had become too bloated and so he decided to cut it into two books AFFC and ADWD. So elated was I with AFFC that I read these books back to back to get what Martin says was his original intent. (he actually says to cut the two books up then put them together in chronological order). When I reached the end of ADwD, I said: \\"THANK YOU!!!\\" He could have EDITED this great manuscript and he could have taken the easy way out and given in to the presure to quickly turn out this book, but that may have turned out only a decent ADwD who's sole purpose would have been to move his story arc on pace with the first 3 books. Instead of cutting it down, he cut it up and added more magic. TONS of it. Who does that? Only GRRM! And we recieve the type of beatiful product one would expect from such a method.<br /><br />The reviewers who gave this book 5 stars did it out of love. They claim that the 1 stars voted so because \\"this book wasn't what they imagined/expected\\". This is a load of hooey. They didn't have concrete imaginings for ASoS or any of the first 3 for that matter, yet still loved them. THESE PEOPLE, turned something beatiful (this series, this product of a beatiful mind) into something to judge, to show how high brow they are. The same way a spoiled rich kid buys expensive things, shows them off, only not to take care of them, just to prove that she doesn't care about something so expensive or great. Bucky Jones and her sheep are just spoiled rich kids, who, consciously or otherwise, became fans of this series x number of years ago, so that today they could say that this great series has taken a turn for the worse and is no longer up to their standards. I, however, understand that GRRM has a lot of world to cover and it takes pages to do that. But as MANY people will agree, a rigid red pen and a pair of scissors would have made a Dance with Dragons or AFFC/ADwD much easy for fake fans to read and understand.<br /><br />To the five star reviewers: Tell me that you LOVED every chapter and the character to whom it belonged. Because I can honestly say that I LOVED them all.<br /><br />Amazon, please fix my rating, it should be 6.5 stars out of 5.
B004G600A4|4.0|Based on the mythological Rapunzel tales which go back even further to the Maiden in the Tower tales (dealing with isolation, emotional captivity and coming of age).  It's an updated version as a fantasy animation comedy/musical with a roguish hero, a spunky heroine and some basic themes about joy and living your dream.  Mandy Moore is the acting and singing voice of Rapunzel and the whole cast is good (even the minor cast) but in some scenes it seems like the evil witch steals many of the scenes with her underhanded psychological abusive attacks on her fake daughter  intertwined with a bit of defensive love. The ending would be a bit of a cheat in an adult tale but as this was intended more for kids it works out well enough and nobody becomes traumatized as a result. Heh. Disney fans will appreciate this being its 50th animation. People who want to do more research about this particular mythology can start at Wikipedia and find it at many other online sources. Interesting take on the hair that I've never read about but it wouldn't surprise me if it was in one of the old folk tales.

B00003CXCT|5.0|There seem to be fanboys who cry over the changes saying how star wars was never about special effects. with that being said Star Wars was awesome, is awesome and will always be awesome. I don't give a flying flip who shot first since they shoot at the same basic time now, nor do i care about the change.  i loved the additional footage of Harrison Ford interacting with a well rendered Jabba the Hutt. What kind of Star wars fan doesn't want more Han Solo? any way you get to see the progression of the characters in star wars and that is what i love about both trilogies is their progression of the characters. Luke Skywalker goes from Tatooine farm boy who transforms into a Jedi Knight and hero of the rebel alliance. Han Solo transforms from a space pirate/smuggler into a general of the Rebel alliance. what is memorable in star wars are the jedi battles between Luke and Darth Vader. the light saber duel on the death star my favorite. what Star Wars always delivers in spades are the actual star wars. the space battles are always building and building through each movie until it reaches a crescendo in a really spectacular final space battle in Jedi.all movies i would rate 10 out of 10 but my Personal favorite is Return of the Jedi. I recently watched the Entire Star Wars saga From Episode 1 to Episode 6 and i must say it is one of the most incredible science fiction stories ever put to film. I would recommend this Box set because each film comes with audio commentary and the bonus disc which has cool featurettes and a documentary that chronicles the phenomenon of star wars and the rise of George Lucas.
B002Q7JYPC|1.0|\\"How Long,\\" \\"What Do I Do with My Heart,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Hear Any More,\\" and \\"You Are Not Alone\\" are the only worthy songs on this 20-song set. \\"Do Something,\\" \\"Long Road out of Eden,\\" and \\"Center of the Universe\\" are mediocre, although not trash worthy. This leaves 13 songs out of 20 songs, worthy of the trash! I say this with reservation, and I realize the reason I got 1 star out of 5, on my comment, because most today don't know great music. They accept s*** just for the sake of accepting it because the want to. I am a big Eagles fan, but I call it as I see it, and sometimes the truth hurts.

There is something going on from page 1 to page 1014 and if you read The Pillars of the Earth,  you will recognize  the families even though this story is 200 years later.    If you like history, Ken Follett has done another outstanding job of researching this time in England, and you get  a real feel of the period and what was going on during the 14th century.    I highly recommend this book and would love to book in the series.

0553103547|5.0|George R. R. Martin's book, a Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1) is a fantastic read. It has been on my short list of series to dive into and I finally decided to take the plunge. With the HBO series coming out I was afraid of accidentally running into spoilers so I am now reading the series.<br /><br />The story itself starts out a bit hard to follow. Several characters have nicknames and the point of view changes rapidly. This is a bid confusing early on but you'll get into the flow of the story quickly and come to find it very enjoyable.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I purchased the hardback. It is very high quality and the jacket does not have any HBO branding on it.

0553801473|5.0|Wow, that's a pretty even spread of reviews, isn't it?  While the sales I'm sure are enough to make the publisher happy, it's clear from looking at reviews of the first three books compared to the last two that things have changed slightly.  Any negative reviews early on tended to focus on how graphically violent the series could be, nowadays readers are almost praying for violence just to make something happen.  Some folks are starting to throw around the Robert Jordan comparisons, which is a bit of a low shot, but it shows how the attitudes have shifted slightly.  Two books ago, this series could do no wrong.  Times have sure changed and some degree of disillusionment has been going on.  What the heck happened?<br /><br />People have come into this series with a great deal of high expectations, a lot of it fairly warranted.  By most accounts and while this is by no means a consensus, the first three books in the series are really, really awesome.  They were a fantastic mix of fantasy and sheer operatic grit, operating in a world where the rules weren't much different than here, even if the stakes were higher.  Wedded to a fascinating back story and given a huge cast of characters who were torn between scheming to get on top and sheer survival, you had a whole confluence of events that were clearly racing toward a conclusion that wasn't going to be pretty but was going to be worth the ride.  Then Martin had to split up the fourth novel into two parts (the second of which is this novel, as well as parts of the next one) even as the books themselves got longer and the gaps between them became longer as well.  What had been taking only two years in between books was now taking up to five, and while four years got us three books, it's taken a decade to get two more.  None of that should matter if the novels are good, though, right?  It's the ultimate quality that is the deciding factor, right?<br /><br />Unfortunately by lengthening the gestation process for each book he's only raising expectations higher.  We're wired that way, go figure.  While we still expect greatness because we're unfair and unforgiving that way, by putting five years in between each book it's almost implicitly promising that it's going to be mind-blowing and completely worth the wait.  And is that what we get here?  Not quite.  So, what's happened?  Or what is happening?<br /><br />As it says on the package, this book picks up on all the stuff that we didn't get to see in Book Four, notably what everyone's favorite dwarf Tyrion and future dragon-queen Daenerys are up to, as well as a host of other characters that were involved in that part of the planet.  Splitting the books up, while it probably made sense from a publishing perspective, has really only served to dull the momentum of the books.  While the early novels were masterpieces of intensity, here it feels like the pace has slackened somewhat and seems to be taking a more leisurely trot toward the bloody conclusion we all know is coming.  Tyrion is a case in point . . . he's constantly referring to events that happened at the end of the third book, which for him was a very recent event.  For the rest of us, it was close to a decade ago and feels off for some reason.  We've been apart from these people for too long and they seem to have changed somewhat in the interim.  Or maybe we have.  Everyone goes through their motions and furthers their plans but it all seems somehow more . . . static.<br /><br />This is the big problem with the book and seems to be a fairly common complaint.  It promises the awesome without actually bringing it.  He had his pick of fairly interesting plotlines to work from and further.  Maybe too many and that may be another reason that the novels feel somewhat blunted.  With so much to work with there's no way to keep all those balls dancing in the air without the pace suffering somewhat.  He's got a hard task in front of him . . . having set all these plots in motion and scattered them to the four winds he's got to bring them all back so that the players are all on stage for the conclusion, a task right now that probably feels like steering the Titanic.  Which may explain why a good portion of this book feels like it's treading water, marking time waiting for all the elements to interlock and come together.  Tyrion spends the entire book trying to get to Daenerys, without really succeeding.  In times past he would have met up with her before the book hit the halfway mark and livened up the scene with an alliance of scheming.  Here everyone is like blind people feeling their way around the same room.  Everyone is close, but nobody knows it and thus they never interact.  Daenerys, waiting for Tyrion, can't do much and so falls in love and kills time with courtly matters.  Then does something fairly important and vanishes for what feels like hundreds of pages.  Oops.<br /><br />The other chunk of the book is taken up by Jon Snow and his merry crew over at the Wall.  The Night Watch has been waiting for winter it seems since the book started and the rumored presence of the Others has been haunting the background of events almost since the beginning.  But again, it feels like we're stuck in a holding patterns, with the Others j-u-s-t about to attack and for a thousand pages never really making an appearance.  Again, maybe it needs to all happen at once, but until then he sort of dithers and comes to no firm decisions, making preparations for stuff that isn't going to happen yet.  He argues with the Watch, he deals with the Wildings, he argues with hardcore hopeful king Stannis and at the end of the book we're almost where we've begun.  Well, almost.  And this is the other part of the problem.<br /><br />We get a thousand pages of everyone moving in circles and then right toward the end the awesome starts to come back as events begin to speed up again.  Stannis makes a move that might go poorly, Jon Snow gets a move made, Daenerys puts herself in a different position and Tyrion could potentially make everyone's life miserable (which has been consistent at least) . . . and then the book ends.  We get all this setup, with very little of the consequences and Martins leaves us on the cusp of events being about to explode.  Which on some level is fine, if the next book contains all these explosions then people will probably proclaim as regaining that vibe that has been missing all this time.  And when the series is done and capable of being read as a piece people probably won't even notice how this book seems transitional.  But we need explosions here now because we're reading these novels as they come out and since we're in some way financing the next book or two (or improvements on his house, or his stamp collection, it hardly matters) we're at least owed some nod to the serial format.  Asking for a book that operates as a complete book on its own and also as part of a larger piece is not too much to ask for, especially when years go by between novels.<br /><br />Ultimately, none of this may matter.  This may indeed be a transitional piece, necessary because the huge amount of plots made splitting the last book necessary.  If he can follow through on what barely gets started here, wrap it up in two books (plausible, the elements for the finale are getting into place) and get them out at a reasonable pace (even if his and my definitions of \\"reasonable\\" probably differ), it will be seen as a slightly flawed masterpiece with a great beginning and end and a slightly bloated middle.  That's okay.  Getting all the characters back together in the same novel is a step in the right direction.  Everyone is too scattered here, and that intensity that informed the early books because everyone was constantly scheming and playing off each other is missing here.  We need interactions between the main host again.  We need them to start plotting directly to kill each other.  Everyone right now is inhabiting their own separate short story inside the novel and we need them to be part of one novel again, racing toward the conclusion.  It's possible, it really is.<br /><br />Martin's storytelling skills are intact, at no point did I want to fling this across the room.  It kept me reading for a thousand pages.  That's no mean feat.  Some sequences are close to fantastic, all the stuff with Reek, Arya's chapters, the brief glimpses of Jaime and Cersei.  Tyrion remains entertaining and once Daenerys becomes a mover and shaker (plus one new character who the jury is still out on) things could happen rapidly.  The potential is there.  I care about what's there and what's missing.  I want to know what happens with Bran, with Brielle, with Catelyn Tully and the Vale.  I love the flashbacks we get and how Aerys and Rheagar and all the people we never saw feel like real characters even though we've only heard about them through the voices of others, how it feels like myth real people witnessed.  I love how the history breaths and is constantly being made before us.  I know he's under a lot of pressure, even if he'd maybe never admit it (maybe he's not, he is a professional after all).  You can only hear the \\"modern Tolkien\\" comparisons for so long before you start to realize that people are expecting a masterpiece for the new century, when all you wanted to do was tell this nifty fantasy story.  But we read and we're here and for the most part, we're sticking around until the end.  So, just relax and tell the story and let it unfold.  It doesn't need to be perfect and huge and epic and all those things that high fantasy is supposed to be, just good.<br /><br />Ultimately this will only be seen as a blip.  You've got all the ingredients in front of you and two more books.  You've got this, George.f in a different position and Tyrion could potentially make everyone's life miserable (which has been consistent at least) . . . and then the book ends.

B003OJBWGK|3.0|I've enjoyed the CD by Those Darlins and read Best Coast compared to them; so I thought I'd check it out.  Bethany Cosentino's vocals do resemble those.  If I close my eyes to float retro back to the 60s era, I can also hear Nancy Sinatra on \\"Those Boots Are Made for Walkin'.\\"  Certainly, Best Coast is out to prove that the 2-minute pop song is not dead.  The guitars are loud, the sun shines and this is a summertime soundtrack.  At the same time, I have yet to connect with the songs.  The arrangements are all similar with similar tempos.  Unless I'm missing something, no one is actually credited for writing these tracks.  The bonus track \\"When I'm With You\\" is my favorite, a great tune that sticks in your head, \\"I hate sleeping alone.\\"  Enjoy!
1416562605|5.0|Most of the negative reviews about this book stem from East Indians. There is an answer to that. Most East Indians do not like a book, movie or article that makes middle to upper class Indians look bad. They are only interested in keeping the status quo in India. Retaining 50% poverty rate, 67% illiteracy rate, poor educational system, poor health care etc, etc. Any book that disparages middle or upper class Indians from India, they will surely attack. Don't believe the hype. This is a very entertaining and insightful book, do yourself a favor and purchase one!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Great app.  Progressive difficulty levels and very addicting.\n\nMirrors and prisms occasionally lose sight of what they are to do, but a simple delete and replacement gets you right back on the road.
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|It is as if the director were saying \\"look at me, look at me, am I not fabulous?\\", instead of giving us a truthful movie with a tight well-written story. Practically everything Elizabeth did and said was written down in her own time. It is very easy to follow history and produce a thrilling story about these events, but this director decided to give us lies and dress up the lies in his concept of art. Got news for him--the art lies in story telling, not dressing it up with costumes, dark moody sets, and special effects. Everything here is overdone. Poor writing with unrealistic sappy dialogue and historical lies cannot be saved with expensive (but gaudy) costumes and fancy camera work. The truth in this story would have been far more interesting than this ego-driven director's vision. For instance, did you know that Elizabeth refused to pay many of the sailors who fought and risked their lives to save her royal butt from the Spanish? Many of them died later of diseases and starvation while living in filth, but her royal partying went on.  But if you wish to find far greater evil, read the histories of the Borgia and Medici popes. This movie was long, tedious, poorly scripted, overdone, boring, sappily dialogued, ego-driven, and mostly lies. I should have turned it off half way through, but I wanted to see just how bad it was going to get.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|Absolutely riveting film.  The photography and scenery are spectacular and the suspense is nerve-wracking.  Agreed that the romantic element seems a bit unnecessary but that's a quibble.  As man vs nature films go, this one's at the very top.  Highly recommended.
B003Y3BMFM|4.0|The second &quot;best of&quot; release from Soundgarden was meant to correspond to a version of Guitar Hero. While the earlier &quot;A-Sides&quot; is a beefier collection, this CD pares down to 12 songs. Of course, you can splurge and jump up to the double disc that has live versions and B-sides. However, Soundgarden is a decent collection of one of the most influential of the Seattle bands, along with Pearl Jam and Nirvana.<br /><br />Soundgarden mixed the sludgy hard riffs of Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin with the attitude of the Grunge period. Lead singer Chris Cornell is a world class frontman, whose vocal style ranged from a screaming wail to hushed psychedelia. Kim Thyall remains a terrific guitarist, with versatility that grew the longer the band existed. Soundgarden also followed the classic career arc; really good rock band starts indie (the Sub-Pop single, &quot;Hunted Down&quot;), start finding their chemistry (&quot;Hands All Over&quot; from &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;) gel completely (the incredible &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; from &quot;Bad Motor Finger&quot;) and then cut a classic for the ages (all the cuts from &quot;Superunknown&quot;). Then they begin to unravel (still great &quot;Blow Up The Outside World&quot;) as they cut the swansong album. But they still cut three great hard rock albums, and one world class single/video in the swirling drone of &quot;Black Hole Sun.&quot;<br /><br />There are two bonus reasons to have &quot;Telephantasm.&quot; &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; from the movie &quot;Singles&quot; is included, and the new song that brought Soundgarden to reunion, &quot;Black Rain,&quot; is better than expected. Granted, a copy of &quot;A-Sides&quot; and &quot;Superunknown&quot; is likely all the Soundgarden you'll probably ever need, but for a best of, this single disc does the job.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|One word, wow. This is far and away the best show on TV right now, and definitely the best show since The Sopranos ended. Everything was flawless in season 4, and it may be my favorite season of the series. Buy it, download it, DVR it, but definitely watch it!
B003HFFVEA|4.0|The item I am reviewing is the CD/DVD set. First, let me say I am a big fan of The Chemical Brothers, but have a preference for their earlier material (\\"Exit Planet Dust\\" and \\"Come with Us\\" are probably my 2 favorites). The material subsequently released, while good, didn't capture the same spark and creativity of their first 4 albums. I think \\"Further\\" recaptures some of that early vibe and has some really good high points (\\"Escape Velocity, \\"Swoon\\" and \\"Horse Power\\" stand out, although all of it is good). That's just for the CD listening experience, but when you add in the visuals of the DVD, it gets taken to a entirely different level. Of course it's not fair to compare listening/watching to just listening as they are fundamentally different experiences (it would not fair to compare watching this DVD to listening to one of their previous albums in my estimation). That being said, if you are a fan of their music, and like \\"trippy\\" images, you are going to enjoy this. It really seems that the sound and images are married perfectly together and are very complimentary, creating something that has more impact and perceived complexity than either one would alone. I think the music show them in old form and the visuals just enhance that experience. While I could recommend the CD alone for some \\"old school\\" Chemical Brothers, it's well worth it to purchase the CD/DVD set!

B0052AJ1OO|4.0|I had seen the movie \\"Hanna\\" when it first came out, partly because the storyline sounded interesting and also because I knew the Chemical Brothers did the soundtrack for it. I have been a fan of theirs since the 90s, and still love the early material they put out. While I do prefer their earlier albums, this one is very good. Let me first say, that you if you haven't had a chance to see \\"Hanna\\" and you think you'd be at all interested I would say to check it out. If you think you'd be interested in the movie, and are also a fan of the Chemical Brothers I would say definitely watch it if you get a chance. The music really adds a lot of dimension to to the movie, and even if I didn't know who it was, I would have still been interested in purchasing the soundtrack. That's important to keep in mind when listening to this - there are some very short songs and some that really do sound like they are meant to be listened to in context. All in all, if you're a fan of The Chemical Brothers, you're going to like this. While not as good as something that was meant to be a stand alone listening experience, it's still stands on its own and is probably one of my favorite recent soundtrack along with Daft Punk's \\"Tron\\".
B004D5H2M2|5.0|This set fits both veteran and new collectors. As a veteran who owns every set this is a welcome addition. First you get 7\\" edit versions of Rubycon, stratosfear, cyclone, some excerpts and a 30 sec. radio adverts of pheadra and rubycon. Next you get a clear, crisp remaster sound like the definitive 1995 reissues. Last is a new cover art of stratosfear with the other albums on it. This set also comes in handy 5 albums in 3 cds plus additional tracks. For the new collector this saves you time, money and space plus bonus material not found in the single cds. In addition to a booklet with photos, album covers and information taken straight from the individual albums. The only setback here is the exclusion of encore. Hopefully Virgin would come out with the next set 1979-1983. This should include live unreleased tracks from these years e.g. Thermal inversion, heritage survival, bondy parade etc. Make it a 5 cd so Logos and tons of 7\\" edit versions would be added.

As part of ordering I wasn't able to escalate shipping to UPS or FEDEX from the USPS, so I send an email to 283mediacity on 7/25/11 requesting escalated shipping at an additional cost to me so I could receive this item by 8/11/11 my son's birthday.  283mediacity never responded to my email and on 7/25/11 they mailed out my order using the USPS with a delivery date of 7/29/11 to 8/15/11.  I sent them a second email to 283mediacity on 8/2/11 informing them that the tracking status for my DVD's was unknown and I also stated that I was not happy about them never responding to my earlier email on 7/25/11.  Once again no reply from 283mediacity at all.  As of today (8/16/11) no DVD's or email's from 283mediacity at all!!  Based on this I contacted Amazon customer support and an Amazon.com A-to-z Guarantee Claim has been filed to attempt to credit my MasterCard for this order.  The tracking information for this order is the same today as it was on 7/25/11 which is \\"no tracking information available for this order\\".  I would recommend that no one ever order anything from seller 283mediacity as they have proven to me to be VERY UNRELIABLE and VERY DISCOURTUOUS to their customers.  Buyer beware don't buy from 283mediacity unless you enjoy no service and many purchasing problems.
0618918248|5.0|If you read only one book this year...<br /><br />...make it \\"The God Delusion\\" by Professor Richard Dawkins<br /><br />I was utterly surprised by the eloquence and confident patience which Dr Dawkins lays out his case. I had heard of the charges from some Clergy and those on the Christian Right that this book exhibited a \\"strident\\" disregard for people of faith and \\"cherished beliefs\\", in my own opinion those charges are completely false.<br /><br />To my mind, Dr. Dawkins treats the subject with fully-padded \\"kid-gloves\\" on and even encourages an approach and understanding that no open-minded person, even if they are one of the \\"faithful\\", would disagree with. So, if you are one who wants to know what this book is about but \\"fear for your faith\\" then this book is for you, it is not offensive, derogatory, or insulting in the least.<br /><br />\\"Walk in Dr. Dawkins shoes for a mile\\"<br /><br />What you will find is a treasure trove of information that will help you to navigate the persistent questions that confront our society at a time when we need to choose between what we choose to \\"believe\\" about the past and where we are going in the future. Most of us are incapable of \\"stepping outside\\" our own bubbles to see the world in a different way, we tend to ignore and avoid those things which cause us anxiety and fear, things like the fact that there may not be a God at all! I have found that reading materials that help us to confront our worst fears, often helps one to see that the fears are completely unfounded and those fears become conquered, this is such a book.<br /><br />The God Hypothesis is not a guarantee that God exists, so why worry about it? We need to be much more worried about the Hell that we humans inflict on each other that is why I so very much appreciate the story which Dr. Dawkins relates in the book regarding a young Italian Jewish boy of 5 or 6 years of age, who, in 1860 Italy was kidnapped by the Catholic Inquisition (with support from the Pope) so that he could be \\"raised a Catholic\\" and thereby saved from the evil of his parents Jewish religion. How many Americans know these kinds of stories? How many untold stories are there like this one?<br /><br />Too many, I suspect.<br /><br />Some will say that this is a book about God, or a book about Religion, or a book about Evolution, but to me its a book about us, the human species and our quest to know ourselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.reby saved from the evil of his parents Jewish religion.

1250004349|1.0|After more than 840 reviews, why should I still spend time on one more? Because this book truly upset me. Not because of the French police action, which was worse than cruel but as such 'not uncommon' there and then than in all of mankind's existence and anywhere in this world, but because of what seems to me the true intention of the book: using a heart-breaking-'Anne Frank'-like (brave girl in hard circumstances) story to provide the title of the book and stir up the sentiments of the reader, only to immerse us with the author's own little life story, getting us no further than to the sterotypical French, and for that matter, American characters, and here and there the books seems written with already a movie (read: $$$) in mind. A product made to sell.<br />What have we here: 50 pages of the 'key' story. Quite well told, absolutely heart breaking and gut wrenching, especially to those who were not in WW2, or have never heard a witness report and are therefore not used to the extreme injustice done to these poor people.<br />But the real story is the author constantly showing herself off as an American-but-oh-so-ohlala-Parisian writer, varnished here and there with false modesty, telling about her marriage with this oh-so-stereotypical French male - so handsome but so immature...... you know......<br />Cutting the two parallel stories into alternating two or three page sections I experienced as a gimmick to cover up blend nothingness of the first 50 pages of her own story. So disturbing that, after switching with the book from the one to the other story twice I just read the whole 'key' story pages first, then returned to read the author's own story. I couldn't read both at the same time.<br />So, after approximately 100 pages, the reader is left with the author's 'real' story, which I let everybody be their own judge of, but I didn't see it as more than a convoluted showing-off of herself and revanche on her ex. Only much later after many transatlantic wishy washyness do we for a short time see Sarah back, who had conveniently killed herself, which spared the author from having to develop Sarah's character from young girl to damaged adult.<br />Other equally less enthusiastic reviewers already mentioned the disturbing amount of totally impossible coincidences that the story contains. Badly constructed coincidences feel like lies, yet it seems that the 'key' story is sufficiently tearing the eyes of many readers that they are overlooking and smoothly accepting these impossibilities.<br />The 'key' story was worth being told, as is all of humans' suffering and drama, but in this book it drowns in the author's own little drama.<br />If this was a writing assignment in college, I would give it a D-.a short time see Sarah back, who had conveniently killed herself, which spared the author from having to develop Sarah's character from young girl to damaged adult.

0553801473|5.0|Wow!  At the risk of incurring the oh so \\"insightful\\" disses of my positive review from the trolling trolls going through and accusing the writers of robo-reviewing or of having been somehow monetarily compensated by GRRM for their having attested to liking his book, let me just say I loved this one.  I guess I can take solace in the fact that my reading preferences jibe with those of the literati reviewing for the major publications and I can also take comfort that my reading preferences do NOT jibe with those of the ill-literati who have (apparently) nothing better to do with their time than endlessly comment on other reviews of this book.  What's the matter guys, World of Warcraft lost it's luster?  I can understand someone not liking a book; what I can't quite comprehend is someone making it their life's mission to excoriate the opinions of those who disagree.  Who exactly is getting paid for what here???!<br />As far as my review, as my rating shows I really enjoyed this book.  Others have mentioned that the Dany chapters were meandering and draggy and seemed bogged down and I have to agree.  That's the 1/2 star off for me.  Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed reading this one.  I for one adore the descriptions of food and heraldry and muck and grime; it made the story very real for me and immersed me into the world GRRM has created.  I especially loved how he counterbalanced the rich feasts for some with the desperate meals of horse-flesh or worse for others.  The aftermath of war and the precursor of another war plus Winter coming are harsh realities felt more by some than by others at this juncture.  Anyone else find the \\"pork\\" dishes suspicious?  Both the \\"roast pork\\" Coldhands brought to Bran et al and the giant Pork Pie Manderly served up after the disappearance of the Freys?<br />I also appreciated how much I started DIS-liking Tyrion in this one.  He did something awful and his conscience is suffering and he is whinging away and self-pitying for a good partof the story.  It felt very real to me and it was very well done.<br />The surprise introduction of another contender for the throne was also a lot of fun and I really loved the Varys bit at the end.  Oh no he didn't!  Can't wait to see the fallout from all that!<br />The book felt to me much like the opening of a chess game with all the pieces being moved into place for the big finale.<br />I, for one, am hopeful that the finale lives up to the build-up.  It seemed an impossible task to pull it all together in the end, but even though AFFC shook my faith a little, this one restores it and I am going to be waiting a few more years I'm sure to see how he starts wrapping it all together.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|It had everything I want in a movie.  Timothy Olephant :o), a dog that turns into a monster to protect his master.  Gorgeous main characters.  Sure it may have been a bit campy, but maybe not all of us want to work at understanding some obscure plot.  (after  all look how Twilight has done, in my 2 bits, this movie has more actual story than Twilight).    I am really hoping they pick up the francise, I want to see what happens next!
1588167461|5.0|A pretty good book for beginners or experts on how to dress. The book itself is small and elegant, its easy to read and understand because of the pictures and the tips. No complaints.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I confess...I came late to the discovery of this production and did not know of its existence until this past year.  I now watch it over and over and still find subtleties that I have never noticed before.  If I should wear out my current DVD's...which is possible with how much I watch it...I would have to immediately purchase a new copy.  This has been my best entertainment investment ever!  You can see other reviews that explain the plot and the characters.  I find some characters very annoying and sometimes skip over those parts...but they are supposed to be annoying characters, so no discredit to the actors. The engaging characters more than make up for it.  The color and sound are exquisite in the version I bought.  For example, when wearing headphones and watching it I can hear the clock on the mantle ticking behind me, plus other subtle sounds.  Some period films use low lighting for indoor scenes at night.  I understand this sensibility to historical accuracy, but I do not enjoy watching them.  This production uses well lighted scenes throughout.  If you want \\"in your face\\" plot, then this DVD may not be for you. However, I absolutely adore the scene where Mr. Darcy's face glows as Elizabeth sings and plays at his estate. It is very, very subtle. Then, seeing how Elizabeth deftly handles an inquiry by Miss Bingly about Mr. Wickham while at Darcy's estate...I can count multiple reasons why this is one of the most well crafted scenes in all of English literature.  (Okay, I am nothing close to a literature critic...so this is just an ordinary citizen's opinion.)  This one scene resolves so many issues in the story, and so elegantly. If you want an in your face storyline...and demand something that explains it to you, this DVD is not for you.  If you don't mind subtleties, thinking about what you are watching, and want historical romance - this is the DVD you absolutely cannot pass up.

B00005JLF5|5.0|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was launched midway through the 1992-93 viewing season.  Living in a household where The Next Generation was a fixture, I found the concept of a Star Trek series which took place at a fixed location - as Mr. Spock would put it - fascinating.  My teenage mind ascertained the idea that instead of the characters being on a ship travelling to the action, the action came to them.  Some viewers disliked that idea, but I didn't.  In fact, I came to enjoy Deep Space Nine more than I'd enjoyed Next Generation.<br /><br />Much of the series' premise was established during the pilot episode, \\"Emissary.\\"  Starfleet Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) has been assigned as the Federation commander of Deep Space Nine, an assignment he protests.  He's not alone; his first officer is Bajoran major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), a fiery woman lamenting the Federation's presence in her home, fresh out of a 50-year occupation by the Cardassians.  After a meeting with Kai Opaka, the Bajoran spiritual leader, Sisko learns he is the emissary to their prophets and must locate the Celestial Temple.  This he does, discovering a stable wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant in the process.  After an internal struggle over his career choices and to finally come to terms with his wife's death, Sisko decides to stay on Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />This first season contains several firsts, including the debut appearances by Garak a Cardassian working officially as a tailor whom Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig) suspects to be a spy, Grand Nagus Zek, the leader of the Ferengi alliance and Bajoran spiritual leader Winn Adami (Louise Fletcher) who consistently uses traditions and literalism to bolster her position, as well as her adversary, Vedek Bariel Antos.  In addition, there are numerous Next Generation crossovers.  For starters, Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) was the only frequent Next Generation character to become a regular on DS9.  According to the pilot, Sisko's command instructions are delivered on board the Enterprise by Jean-Luc Piccard, who'd been assimilated by the Borg and present at Wolf 359 where Sisko's wife was killed.  Plus, the Klingon sisters Duras, Q, Vash and Ambassador Lwoxanna Troi all put in appearances during this season (Ambassador Troi would appear twice more in subsequent series).<br /><br />When this show was new, it was easy as a viewer to relate with many of the individual character arcs.  Sisko struggles to accept his assignment as station commander while trying to be a good father to his teenage son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton); Kira tolerates serving jointly with the Federation; Dr. Bashir deals with his self-absorption as a medical \\"wiz kid\\" and his nagging attraction to Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell); security chief Odo (Rene Auberjonois) makes no bones about his dislike of Quark (Armin Shimmerman), the Ferengi bartender; Chief O'Brien looks for ways to make the station feel like home for his wife, Kaiko and daughter, Molly.  It's easy to sympathize with all of the regulars, especially if you've been forced to live and work someplace you disliked.  The comforting part is, by the end of this first season, all the co-inhabitants have learned to work together and depend on each other when serious problems arise.<br /><br />Of all the series regulars, the one I was most fascinated by was Dax, a character from a species known as Trill.  Though the Trill were touched upon during Next Generation, few members of that race were included in Next Generation or DS9, and it was essentially through Dax that the viewers learned about the species.  Jadzia's antecedent host, Curzon Dax had been present during the events concluding Star Trek VI: the Undiscovered Country (helping map out a peace treaty with the Klingons). He was an aficionado of Klingon culture and of Ferengi gaming (especially tongo).  He was a functioning alcoholic with an interest in women which would get him in trouble on multiple occasions.  In his elder years, Benjamin Sisko was Curzon's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, a trusted confidant and the best friend he ever had.  Curzon Dax died two years before the Federation arrived at Deep Space Nine, when Sisko met Jadzia Dax for the first time.  Their friendship would continue and provide a source of drama, comedy and suspense.protégé, a trusted confidant and the best friend he ever had.

B004YM67OI|5.0|This movie was fantastic. Leaves you wondering what's going on without complicating the plot on is way to an easy to follow outcome. Too many movie have a reveal that just makes you wonder how and why you got there. Not Unknown. Loved it. Some of the flashbacks were a little to graphic without really adding anything.
B001F12J0C|4.0|I'm not really somebody who cares about DVD packaging so I love this set.  It got me all three movies at a good price.  But if you are somebody who desires really durable packaging that will look nice down the road, you might want to continue looking.  The packaging isn't BAD, but it's definitely not made to last.
B000EB73NC|5.0|I bought this to replace a twist lock that broke in a mountain bike crash.  Fortunately, the twist lock broke releasing the CS600 from being damaged.  The twist lock works great and seems to be designed to break in the event of a hard hit (a good thing) but always holds the CS firmly even in rough mountain biking.  I also have the CS mounted to a road bike.  Works great and very intuitive.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This was a great book. Martin did a really good job making me love and/or hate the characters. The story is fantastic and I can't wait to continue this series.<br />I only had 2 issues that kept me from giving this 5 stars. First, there are a ton of characters. Keeping track of who's who in the earlier parts of the story was very confusing. This wasn't helped by occasionally calling someone by their first name and other times by their last name. Second, I don't think the storyline concerning the Night Watch really fit in. I was so engrossed with the other stories that I grumbled every time I was pulled back up to the Wall. I'm sure this will play a larger role in the books to come, so I can live with it for now.
B004HO6I4W|3.0|I bought this somewhere else because it was on sale, got it home and went to install it on my new ANDROID Tablet only to find out that the only choices to install are either through ipad or Windows Media Player.  I tried to install with Windows Media Player and was able to get the movie on to my device, but it simply wouldn't play.  I called the customer service department on the back of the package and apparently I'm not the only one who is having this problem with the download version of this movie for Android.  Customer service said they would try and get an answer for me on how to get this movie to play on Android, but so far nothing.  They said Fox is aware of this issue and there should be a fix by OCTOBER.  But I need a fix NOW.  I will update if I hear back and can get this thing to play on Android.    Other than that, I would recommend.  Besides the hiccup on the downlad version for Tablets etc, you also get the DVD and a Blu Ray version in this package.  For that price, this was a steal.
0765365278|3.0|The characters and settings in this book are really well done, and I enjoyed reading about most of them. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything to tie them all together until the very end of the book making the whole thing very disjointed. It reminded me of reading books 5 & 6 of the Wheel of Time series, definitely not a stand alone novel.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is one of the few new(er) weekly tv programs that I got hooked on.  If you missed the first season on SciFi, get yourself the DVD's and catch up on the fun!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was a great continuation for the series. I love (or hate) all of the characters.  The main storyline is very engrossing, and I can't wait to continue it.  I really like the way all the minor battles are alluded to, but they are never seen as they happen. This keeps the book about the characters and the advancement of the story without wasting time on the fighting.  Once again, the story up north doesn't really seem to fit in, but it is still well done.
0307477479|2.0|I can't be the only one who really didn't like this book, can I? I had such high hopes. And after the first chapter, I had a feeling I was going to love it. But then I got bored really fast. Not necessarily because the book is more like short stories all linked together in some way, than a start to finish story. But more because I didn't like a lot of the characters, felt their story-lines were weak. And I generally love postmodern fiction, so I was surprised not to enjoy this.<br /><br />I feel so silly because it's a Pulitzer Prize winning book and has received all kinds of rewards and accolades. I wanted so badly to like it. But I found myself skipping over passages and trying to remember who all the characters were because they just weren't sticking in my head. I did like that everything is pretty well tied together and makes \\"sense\\" (at least in the end).<br /><br />To be clear, Jennifer Egan is a wonderful writer and has a beautiful way with prose. Her story-line(s) just wasn't for me, but that won't stop me from checking out her next novel when it's released.

0553801473|5.0|I promised myself I would not review anything that already had more than 100 reviews; only a megalomaniac would bother throwing his two cents into an overflowing piggy bank.  But I am writing this review, and I justify it but trying to address those who are considering reading SOIAF:<br />1. But you haven't read any of the books, and you want to know if it is worth starting.<br />2. You enjoyed HBO's Game of Thrones, and want to know if the books are as exciting.<br /><br />I think you should.  A Dance with Dragons is the 5th book of a planned 7 book series. As such, it is part of the middle chapters of the saga.  Frodo will not be casting the Ring into Mount Doom in this book.  A Song of Ice and Fire succeeds, for me, because of the individual chapters and characters. Yes, I want to know what comes next, but, unlike some other multi-volume works, I am not reading the books to know the solution to the mystery. I read it for the journey. Dante would still be worth reading even if he had never finished \\"Paradiso\\". This isn't Dante, but it is a well told story.<br /><br />Dance with Dragons concentrates on the storylines dropped from A Feast for Crows: Dany,Tyrion and Jon Snow.  The latter part of the book picks up where the last volume left off and adds chapters for Cersei and Jaime.  Other characters get their voices, including Bran, Arya, Asha Greyjoy, and some new perspectives as well.<br />Much of the Seven Kingdoms is in ruin, and winter really is coming at last. A sense of strained resources fills the book, and many of the criticized references to food are references to how little food is left. Those lords who have not been hurt by the war become disproportionately powerful, allowing some secondary families to become important players.<br /><br />Much of the book explores the wisdom of our familiar characters in unfamilar situations: will Tyrion's wits save him, now that he is no longer a rich Imp? Can Jon Snow succeed as the Commander of the Night's Watch in times more perilous than any commander has known in half a hundred generations? Now that Dany really has a throne, can she keep it? Does she want to? These questions are all addressed in this book.<br />The remainder of the review may contain some spoilers. Be warned.<br />Martin's writing is fresh as ever. I found some chapters of Feast for Crows uninteresting, but ADWD held my attention throughout. That said, I did get tired of Dany saying, \\"If I look back, I am lost\\" every time she made a poor decision.  Jon Snow tells himself , \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" as he makes one intelligent choice after another. \\"Words are wind\\" you tell yourself after a while. Tyrion ,Jon, and Dany all act rashly: in Dany's case, more often than not. Bran finds his destiny, and so, perhaps, does Arya.<br /><br />The scope of the book expands: we travel down the Rhoyne, spend time in Volantis and get to know more about the cities of Slaver's Bay.<br /><br />Enjoyment of any book is subjective, and far be it from me to disagree with anyone else's view, but a lot of the criticism seems to fall into one of several categories:<br />1. I don't want to wait for the end; give it to me now.<br />2. I want to see the last battle. I got burned by Robert Jordan, and it won't happen again.<br />3 This story is simply too long. I'm interested in (insert favorite character here) and the rest is a waste of time.<br />4. Everybody else is trashing it, and I don't want to seem out of step.<br />5. My favorite characters do stupid things and it annoys me.<br /><br />I am sympathetic to all of these complaints. I've had twinges of 3 (length), bits of 2(Dragons fight NOW, please), and a severe bout of 5 (Khaleesi cannot make up her mind, it is known). But I think the book survives all of these criticisms. I also believe that this book and the last were necessary to set the characters up for the final conflicts. I expect the next book (may we see it in our lifetimes)to get better reviews.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't really write reviews on Amazon even though I spend a good deal of time reading them for entertainment or research into the products I'm purchasing. I've been following this thread for awhile and felt so strongly that this boxed set is subpar at best and a huge slap in the face to the fans, that I had to leave my one star review. This is short and sweet. Everyone that has given this set 1 star is doing it for the right reasons. I'm not going to list off why I'm so furious with George Lucas because I agree with everyone else posting their reviews. I will not buy this collection Mr. Lucas, you will never get my money. And it's sad that as I type this I stare at three framed vintage star wars posters hanging in my office that my father passed on to me from when I was a teenager. I thought this was going to be a no brainer purchase for me so that I could pass on my admiration for these movies to my now young children. Sad times, sad times indeed. But no worries I know how you operate Mr. Lucas, just like Mr. Cameron and all you guys like to do is milk the profits forgetting what got you to where you are in the first place.     Post a one star review if you want the real deal star was collection not this half finished product.
0300169787|4.0|Savage Beauty was one of the best attended exhibitions in the history of the MET for good reason; the exhibition design was as masterful as McQueen's fashion itself. The exhibition's catalog, however, does not exhibit such a sleight of hand in its design. Which is not to say its contents aren't remarkable! The essays and photographs by Solve Sundsbo are top notch. But the catalog as a design form appears poorly tailored in comparaison to its subject matter. The design of the book feels suprisingly bland. While the hologram of the cover resonates with the hologram from the Widows of Culloden runway show, the material on the cover it feels cheaply made, and rather slapped on. That said, attention was paid to the parts of the catalog that are the most important - the essays and photographs - and for that, no fault can be found.
B00009NHC5|4.0|I still have this very vivid memory of when I was about ten and I was obsessed with scary movies (or the idea of watching them) and my mother, who was VERY opposed to me watching anything remotely `scary' decided to rent a slew of older, classic scary films.  I spent a weekend watching movies like `What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' and `Psycho' and `Wait Until Dark'.  I don't know if that is where my love for classic cinema started, but I still love all three of these films to varying degrees, and it did open my eyes to the different shades of `scary film'; as opposed to being completely blinded by modern cinemas fascination with dismemberment and torture.<br /><br />When watching `Wait Until Dark', one is instantly reminded that this is an adaptation from a stage play.  That isn't a bad thing really, but it is a constant reminder thanks to the singular space used for the film (it basically takes place in a single apartment) and the theatrical performances.  You can certainly see the shades of the stage spread thin throughout the engaging performances by the entire cast; especially Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />LOVE HER!<br /><br />The film revolves around a blind woman facing a terrible situation when she (or more specifically, a doll in her possession) becomes the target of con man.  You see, that doll contains heroin.  Audrey's character Susie has no idea what that doll contains, but that doesn't stop the sadistic Roat from harassing her for the doll.  Despite her apparent handicap, Susie is more than prepared to take care of herself; which is a good thing since Roat has no concern for her wellbeing whatsoever.<br /><br />Now that I'm older, rewatching this film certainly delivered in many aspects while I do feel it falls short in others.  I love Hepburn, and I feel that she does an admirable job here, but I also feel that she is almost too proper and controlled to really get inside the character.  When I mentioned earlier about it being theatrical, or stagey, I mean that mostly when regarding her take on the character.  When you are performing on stage it is a different animal than performance in front of a camera.  There is an intimacy that is needed in film that is somewhat put aside on the stage (since stage performance need to exaggerate to convey to an entire audience).  Hepburn is a wonderful actress, but she does take the film down slightly for me.  Arkin is a maniacal genius here though, and his dastardly portrayal of bloodthirsty Roat basically writes the manual for any and all aspiring villains.<br /><br />He sends chills.<br /><br />I found the production team to be particularly worthy of mention since that apartment is perfectly staged to create a homey yet tense atmosphere, and the direction and film editing values are most noteworthy.  This film really understands a depth of `fear' that is not entertained in trashy modern `horror' films.  Sure, this isn't the scariest film out there and it isn't one that is going to elicit the nightmares that some of the more modern gorefests can muster up (sure, these torture porn films can really scare the pants off of you) but it is certainly a classier production and one that will stay with the viewer for better reasons; it's a good movie as opposed to just a good scare.take on the character.

030746363X|5.0|This book is awesome! You don't have to read every chapter, it tells you what chapters to read for your specific concerns!
0143119788|4.0|Well, it's hard to say exactly what I think of this book.  I got it because I wanted to read it before the movie release.  Before all of the espionage fans out there click the \\"not helpful button\\" I want you to know that this is the first hard-core espionage book I've read, and so I'm not too familiar with the genre.  Still, I gave it the old college try.<br /><br />The book is about 350pp long, and for the first 250pp or so I felt like a fly on the wall, watching different public and clandestine meetings between characters as they discussed the possibility of a Soviet mole hiding somewhere in British intelligence, along with glimpses into the mind of the main character.  That would have all been well and good, and maybe I missed something, but I had a tough time keeping all of the people, their thoughts, their interactions, and suspicions straight as I worked through the first 2/3 of the book,  The first 2/3 of the book is the set-up, and the last 1/3 or so is the resolution where all of the loose ends, well, most of the loose ends, were neatly tied up...so if you decide to read this book, hang in there, it will all make sense in the end.<br /><br />Here's the basic premise...the bead of British intelligence believes that there is a Soviet mole somewhere in the upper levels of his organization, but he doesn't know who it is, though he believes it's one of four people.  A trusted, recently retired agent is assigned by the Minister to ferret out the mole.  And so that book takes off...sort of.<br /><br />Was the book \\"good\\"?  Well, I think that since I am pretty to new to this genre I'd have to say that for me it was an adequate read.  You know how it is, you get far enough in that you just want to finish to see it how it turns out.  And that's what happened.  It \\"turned out\\".<br /><br />I'm interested to see what it's like as a movie.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|superbly done film, with much humor, some subtle, my favorite kind. this movie was artfully produced and is a real gem. the performers should get Oscars for their performances.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|For Taylor fans who have been following her from the beginning, this is the album that put her on the map.  A must have album, made even better with the 4 extra songs on this version.  You really get a sense of Taylor's country roots in this album with her lyrics and melodies running very pure and true in each of her songs.  Compared to Fearless and Speak Now, this self-titled album feels more raw and untouched giving that magical feeling that the music has gone from draft paper to recording with very little editing.  For me this is what makes the album so special and enjoyable to listen to, it's also wonderful to see how Taylor's music has progressed from this album to her others.  All in all a great addition to anyone's library and especially for all those Taylor Swift fans out there.
B0055Q5F36|3.0|Anytime one of my friends plan on buying something, they tend to come to me for advice. I've been given the status of the \\"go to guy\\" when it comes to buying gadgets or things like that (don't ask me why, as I'm not sure myself).<br /><br />When it comes to cell phone/PDA protection, I've always recommended Otterbox. I've used their products in the past, and they've always worked great.<br /><br />So when I purchased my Samsung Galaxy S2 on a 3 year contract, it was a no brainer that I would want to protect my investment. So I turned once again to Otterbox. For those of you who don't know, this Otterbox case has 3 levels of protection. 1) A silicone skin that fits directly onto the back of the phone covering up the top, bottom, sides and the back of the phone (leaving the front touch-screen portion of the phone bare), 2) A harder shell made from polycarbonate that *also* covers up the top, bottom, sides and the back of the phone (leaving the front touch-screen portion of the phone bare, and 3) An adhesive screen protector to protect the front touch-screen itself.<br /><br />The first 2 layers of protection I've mentioned (the silicone skin & the polycarbonate shell) are great. The silicone skin has access holes for the USB cable, the microphone, the camera, etc. aligned just perfectly. The polycarbonate shell which snaps onto the phone *after* the silicone skin has been put on, also aligns great. I do question the level of protection it offers should the phone be dropped. The best case Otterbox makes in terms of drop-protection, is their \\"Defender\\" series (Note : This case is NOT the Defender series). I don't think Otterbox has a Defender series case for this PDA just yet.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this particular case though was the screen protector. I had nothing but problems applying it. No matter how slowly I applied it nothing but bubbles appeared. I *very slowly* reversed the process, and attempted to re-apply the adhesive screen. I did this several times only to have the bubbles appear in different places. And I'm not talking about one or two bubbles. I'm talking about like....10 bubbles (different sizes). I was able to push out most of them (but *NOT* all of them) with my fingers, but for the amount of money I spent on this case 0 bubbles is what I expect. Finally, after removing and reapplying the adhesive screen so many times, the adhesive screen protector lost it's adhesive properties so I ended up throwing that portion of the case. I was really ticked off!<br /><br />While my phone is protected with the silicone skin & the polycarbonate shell (which I'm happy about), the screen is bare and more susceptible to scratches and nicks. As I prefaced my review with \\"I've always recommended Otterbox\\"; I'm not new to their product(s) so I know how to use them. Furthermore, I am confident in saying that if I was able to have applied the screen protector without any bubbles, I would be giving this 5 stars. I've applied the exact same screen protector style/type from Otterbox on my other phones without any problems. So, was it a flimsy/defective screen protector? Or was I just having a bad day? You decide. I'm just reporting the facts.<br /><br />I've I just ordered another screen protector online, in the hopes it'll offer that 3rd layer of protection and work seamlessly with Otterbox's 2 layers of protection. This new screen protector boasts \\"No More Bubbles\\" but I won't mention the brand name as I'm here to review this particular Otterbox case, and not that other product. If anybody is interested in knowing the brand I ordered (and how good it really is or isn't), drop me an e-mail and once I've received it (which should be about a week from todays date) and had at least a week to use it, I'll write a review on that one as well.<br /><br />CONCLUSION : People @ Otterbox....you're letting your product quality slip. No good!!!!bles appear in different places. And I'm not talking about one or two bubbles. I'm talking about like....10 bubbles (different sizes). I was able to push out most of them (but *NOT* all of them) with my fingers, but for the amount of money I spent on this case 0 bubbles is what I expect. Finally, after removing and reapplying the adhesive screen so many times, the adhesive screen protector lost it's adhesive properties so I ended up throwing that portion of the case. I was really ticked off!    While my phone is protected with the silicone skin & the polycarbonate shell (which I'm happy about), the screen is bare and more susceptible to scratches and nicks. As I prefaced my review with \\"I've always recommended Otterbox\\"; I'm not new to their product(s) so I know how to use them. Furthermore, I am confident in saying that if I was able to have applied the screen protector without any bubbles, I would be giving this 5 stars. I've applied the exact same screen protector style/type from Otterbox on my other phones without any problems. So, was it a flimsy/defective screen protector? Or was I just having a bad day? You decide. I'm just reporting the facts.    I've I just ordered another screen protector online, in the hopes it'll offer that 3rd layer of protection and work seamlessly with Otterbox's 2 layers of protection.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|Firstly, this remote is almost exactly the same as an XBox 360 remote.  The left joystick controller is located higher than it is on the PS3 controller.  This was not a problem for me because I actually like the setup of this controller.  However, I did not notice it immediately when I ordered this item and may change some peoples minds.    Secondly, the backlight on this remote is a little confusing since it is only one color.  When playing some games, they show the buttons you need to press (God of War for example) and it shows a shape and color.  This is only red.  If you are a person that uses color to determine the button to press, you are out of luck.    Thirdly, when installing this for the first time, it locked up my system.  I could not get it to respond and needed to unplug the system completely, reboot without the remote, add it in the settings, and then reboot again.  Seemed to work that way but it was a pain in the butt to figure out and even at that I'm not sure I figured out anything.      Overall, this is an okay controller.  It works as a cheap second controller if I have company.  But for now, I think I will stick to my original controller and be happy.

1593272839|5.0|This is a terrific book.  It makes what might otherwise seem impenetrable mathy-code and makes it fun and approachable.  This book wipes away Haskell's unwarranted image as \\"too academic\\".  Haskell is fun.  Get this book and learn Haskell for great good!

B000UX6THK|1.0|I bought this item from, what I believe is, Amazon as New.  It is anything but new. the outer casing is so worn it looks as if it was dragged around the house by a child.  The corners are all dog-earred.  Thank God the disks themselves are fine.  I'm now seriously wondering if I should purchase anything from Amazon again.  Especially since I paid a premium to get this quickly.  Maybe I'll just use their private sellers.

B0055SWM08|5.0|totally addictive  this is a very clever app that really tests how many moves you can predict ahead.  it constantly challenges you to think creatively. I have finished 5 or 6 levels.
034552554X|5.0|Since so many have summarized this book so well, I'll skip all that and just say that this is a breathtaking novel. The writing is splendid and the characters are so real that I felt I knew them--and felt their pain. I also love that this novel shines a much needed light on the subject of the foster system, especially in such a heartwrenching, wonderful manner. I also loved the way the meaning of flowers was woven throughout the book. I learned so much!<br /><br />The Language of Flowers may just end up being my favorite book of 2011. It certainly holds that spot at the moment. Overall, a simply breathtaking, beautiful book that I am certain I will reread. I think this book should be picked up by book clubs everywhere. It's rich with topics to discuss.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what this author does next!
B003L77GRO|5.0|I'm just plain excited to own this season. (I own all of the others, so naturally I had to preorder this one.)
B004VD3PE0|5.0|I had this book for 2 weeks before I even could pick it up.  I wanted to read it but at the same time I didn't want to experience the heartbreak that I knew was coming with it.  Be ready to cry, laugh and love the journey it takes you through.  It's a journey filled with the love that a family has for one another and the devestation you feel when you lose them.  Mia questions what there is left to stay for when all she thought has been taken away from her.  It jumps back and forth from past to present, something that I usually don't like but in this context it works very well.  I absolutely loved the book.  I cant wait to read the sequel.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app fully customizable, and if you chose,very hard to dismiss alarms. You can set the alarm to dismiss only when you leave to work (gps required). you can nozzle by shaking the phone, (help you move your blond) and in advance option you can make increase by 1 second increments  the shaking necessary to snooze. and reduce the snooze time on each snooze.<br /><br />My wife tell me I'm dead in the morning because I always dismiss the alarms and do not wake up. But after using this app, the alarm finally wake me up.<br /><br />You can customize the alarm ringtone by tone, music, artist, playlist.<br /><br />Thanks to the developer
1594744769|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much, hate to give 5 stars to a first time novelist, but if future works (sequel perhaps) are as well written as this one, expect great things from this author.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|While this alarm is better than the one that came on my Samsung Galaxy S, I have still managed to accidentally push the disable button instead of the snooze button.  I wish the disable feature had a slider bar to disable instead.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|The art is fun, the sound effects and music add a good dimension, the story writing and dialogue is often clever and humorous, and the gameplay and strategic aspect of the game are fantastic! \nIt&apos;s very original as well, overall a great job on the developers. I&apos;m using the original Motorolla Droid, and games tend to lag a bit, but this one looks great, and runs extremely smoothly.
B003L77GGK|3.0|Like all the reviewers, I'm a major fan of the show, which also explains my disappointment with Season 6. Critics have called it messy, all over the place, unfocused, etc. All of that is true. Every season of the show has had a few episodes that missed the mark. However, Season 6 had about four to six that were really weak. It definitely picks up steam toward the end of the season, but so much potential was squandered early on. I didn't mind that Dean Winchester found a temporary love interest, but his role in the season seemed under written. It was like his job was to spend most of the time reacting to Sam Winchester's return from hell, Sam's changed personality, Sam's loss of his soul, Sam's need to get his soul back, and so on. Meanwhile, Dean's issues made up all of about four episodes, most of which felt forced and uneven. There were also some disappointing red herrings, including the \\"Mother of All\\" subplot that went no where slowly, and the \\"Alphas\\" subplot which started well, but never developed.  It wasn't a bad enough season to lose me as a viewer, but let's hope Season 7 doesn't turn out to be another year of Dean reacting to Sam's problems.
0765322889|5.0|First off, how could this book get a lower rating than any of John Ringo's books?  Or The Unremembered or Havemercy?  These are just the books I recently looked at.  This is the epitome of epic fantasy.  Steven Erickson treats his readers like logical thinking adults (although I would question this based on some of the one star reviews) and lets the book and plot slowly unfold.  Not all questions are answered, nor will they be in the entire series.    The book definitely reads like a first book, it's a little bit clunky at times and sometimes certain details don't entirely jive with the rest of the Malazan Book of the Fallen.  The world creation is the strongest suit, especially the 300,000 years of civlization.  I'm not going to expound on the plot, there are many other reviews here.  I'm just telling you to read this book.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|This book would probably make an excellent chapter in a book about entrepreneurship. It has several points - some obvious, some less so - that are valid, and there's a good chance that almost everyone will get something out of it.    But, really, most people aren't going to get their money's worth. This book is aimed squarely at tech entrepreneurs - I can't count how many times it advised to be okay with putting unfinished products out on the market. This is (probably) good advice to anyone who can easily and quickly change the nature of the product being offered. But what if you're a small manufacturing startup? Or consulting?    So even ignoring that advice, there's a presumption that your business is small. It goes so far as to explicitly say that in some cases.    So, is this book going to benefit you to the tune of $12? Probably not, unless you're a 5-person SaaS startup. But if you're okay with ignoring 75% of an already short book, you'll probably find something here.    (Bonus gripe: For a company so focused on tech and user experience, this book has awful formatting on the Kindle. Do yourself a favor and buy the actual book.)
B001KTATIS|5.0|This is a thoroughly entertaining film, however it is not for the prudish. There are X-rated sex scenes and strong violence. I saw another uncensored version of this same film many, many years ago, and I recall at least 2 scenes in the earlier version not in this version. EG The wheel of death, and rack torture. Why are they missing here? Despite the claim, this film HAS been censored, at least a little bit.  Nevertheless, I can only recommend it as a terrific romp encompassing lots of violence and sex.

B004Y1USJE|2.0|I was going to buy the new King Crimson disc and I read a review that said the new Yes disc was the \\"bomb\\" compared to it.  So stupid me, I listened to the reviewer.  I've stayed away from Yes since the days of Asia,  I know its a long time, and I.m aware they had a great Reunion Disc, but I am just bored by this effort.  Anderson's lyric may have been impenetrable but at least everything sounded like it mysteriously meant something,  not this middle of the road drivel,  These guys are far from the edge, Comfortably in the middle of the fat prog road,  Hate to even call it prog but they have earned their place in the pantheon, just not this CD.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|Besides leaving out about half of the characters and story lines from the book, Gwyneth Paltrow does the worst portrayal of Emma of any production I've watched. Paltrow is so contrived and speaks her lines like she's reading from a prompter. Ok, I'm not a big Paltrow fan but even Jeremy Northam, whom I love, did nothing to improve this abbreviated edition of Emma. Actually, Northam was the only reason I wanted to see this production because I knew cramming this novel into 2 hours was not going to be satisfactory for this lifelong Austen fan.  The production starring Doran Godwin [[ASIN:B000244F64 Emma (BBC, 1972)]] which is available on amazon instant video is by far the most \\"correct\\" and satisfying version of this classic. The 2009 BBC production starring Romola Garai [[ASIN:B002XTBE6K Emma (2009 BBC Version)]] which aired on PBS and also available on amazon (DVD and instant video) is also very faithful to the book. In this hack job production Paltrow's archery demonstration was reeediculous, a good shooter hits the same hole every time and is not all over the HUGE bullseye, and Paltrow clumsily handles the bow, besides this scene never even occurs in the book. The best acting is by the character that plays Harriet Smith, sorry can't remember her name, but she was welcomed respite from the lackluster Paltrow. The interior sets were horrid! What was being covered up with all those hanging textiles? And why were there so many scenes out on the lawns? Too cheap to rent the interiors? Can't believe this earned two academy award nominations for anything except maybe the horses. I must say the equestrian aspect of this production was well done. Loved the Woodhouse's matched paired of bays and Frank Churchill's sturdy, black saddle horse. However, having watched many productions of Emma, this one by far is the worst and not worthy of the price. If you never see it, you won't be missing much.
B0058H8V6K|4.0|Natalia Kills, labelmate of fellow pop perfectionists Lady Gaga and Robyn, has made quite the name for herself overseas, and with any luck, she'll hit it big here in the United States as well. Perfectionist, her debut album, is, quite simply, one of my favorites to be released this year. Because she does manage to showcase different styles of contemporary pop, I believe a song by song review is appropriate:    Wonderland: A dark pop song, definitely one of the best on the album. Natalia does a good job singing the song and the lyrics are definitely one of the highlights of the cd. 5/5  Free: This is about as cute as she gets. It's fun to sing along to, but overall it's one of the more disposable tracks. The will.i.am feature on the American edition seems superfluous to me, and I prefer the original. 3.5/5  Break You Hard: Another highlight of the album - Natalia strikes a nice balance between dark and fun with this one. One of my faves! 4.5/5  Zombie: A slower song about her \\"zombie\\" lover. Not one of my favorites, but the lyrics are neat and it definitely showcases the darker side of her music well. 2.5/5  Love Is A Suicide: The most uptempo song on the cd is great too. The beat is killer and gregorian chants are always cool (though who would've thought to combine the two?). 4.5/5  Mirrors: The lead single is also one of the most immediately striking and notable songs on Perfectionist. Just a generally all around awesome song. I could see this definitely having been a hit if it had been released by someone more known. 5/5.  Acid Annie: My least favorite song from the album. Coming off the high point of \\"Mirrors\\" it doesn't measure up to it in virtually all respects. Any of the bonus tracks from the digital deluxe or international edition would've been a better selection. The lyrics are cool, though, but that's about all I like from this track. 2/5  Superficial: Another slick uptempo that's reminiscient of \\"Free\\". It's a decent song, and defintely not the worst on the album, but it gets overshadowed. 3.5/5  Broke: Another one of my favorites! Natalia takes the time to slow down the tempo. The lyrics are a bit cliche, but her earnest delivery and the solid beat make this one of my favorites. 4.5/5  If I Was God: This is another stellar song as well. The lyrics are relatable and smart, the production is nearly flawless, and the vocals are spot on in both emotional delivery and pitch. Definitely worthy of the album closing position. 5/5    Total Average: 4/5    Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite albums to be released this year. However, the bonus tracks on the digital deluxe edition are definitely worthy of downloading. These include \\"Perfection\\" (a spoken introduction to the album; nothing especially notable but it does help to add flavor), \\"Heaven\\" (a sad downtempo about a deceased loved one; like Broke, her delivery makes this song, and it's almost criminal to leave this out in favor of \\"Acid Annie\\"), Kill My Boyfriend (a cutesey song made notable only by the juxtaposition between the cheery instrumental and the dark lyrics), Not In Love (another dark track, similar to but slightly better than Zombie), and Nothing Lasts Forever (my last favorite, an uptempo slightly like Superficial but with really great production and great vocals). To me, with these songs included, Perfectionist is absolutely a 5/5 album, but the standard edition sacrifices nuance in favor of a more streamlined listening experience. I would recommend buying the deluxe edition, as I think it's 2011 pop at it's best (It brings the great club beats without being either mind-numbingly shallow or heavy handed with faux-deep messages and lyrics), but if you're trying to save a couple of bucks or simply prefer a physical copy, I still wholeheartedley recommend Perfectionist.
0345529057|4.0|I like this series so far can't wait to read the rest of the books. I saw the Game of Thrones on HBO and love it; then a friend said the series was based on books, so I know had to get these. I can't wait until season 2!

1451629184|4.0|Considering that Jaycee's formal education stopeed for the most part when she was 11, she did an excellent job on this book.  There were parts that were difficult to read because they were so graphic but all in all I would say the book was pretty good.  However, it is one of those books I would never be able to read again although it held my interest when I was reading it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Droid Charge and Motorola Xoom. I have had hours of fun with this game. It is challenging yet not exceptionally hard. Well worth the price.
0061730335|4.0|I'll be honest, the book starts off rather slowly. William tells of his childhood in Africa that ranges from the death of an uncle to the famine that struck his land. Once the book picks up, basically when he begins to actually build the windmill, the back story makes a lot more sense. In the end, it is quite difficult to not be enamored with what this young man manages to accomplish with limited resources. Overall, it is a very good read. If you are looking for an inspiring story then this is one you should read!
B004MARLJ2|5.0|I got it on Amazon when it was free, but it is well worth buying if you missed it. it is a strategy game that will keep you addicted for hours. Your job is to save the animals from an evil. Each animal on your team has unique abilities and strengths. Use them to defeat opponents and get new allies. This is one of the best games yet. Worked on my Droid Charge and Motorola Xoom.
B0055S348W|5.0|Had the free version, printed test page just fine. Paid $7.99, it prints outs everything I need it to print. To the person who says paid $7.99 and all it prints is a test page, you&apos;re wrong. You probably don&apos;t have it configured correctly. Paying $7.99, you do get the full version, it just happened to be marked down. I didn&apos;t want to pay $12.95 when I found it on the Android Market, so glad I waited. If you want to print remotely you need to have Cloud Print. Hopefully for all those who want it, it will be discounted again. Definitely worth the $7.99.

0062060554|4.0|Article first published as Book Review:Before I Go To Sleep by S.J. Watson on Blogcritics.<br /><br />Waking up daily, not knowing who you are or where you are can be quite frightening. When the man in bed next to you is also a stranger, fear begins to take over.<br /><br />In Before I Go To Sleep by S. J. Watson, we follow the lives of Christine and Ben as they try to work through the horror of amnesia. Christine's amnesia is much like that Drew Barrymore experienced in the movie titled 50 First Dates. However, in Christine and Ben's life the humor is gone. Every day Christine follows the same path, asks the same questions, and looks at the same pictures, hoping that something will strike that spark she needs to gain her life back. She does not remember anything past her 29th birthday, including her marriage and husband. The explanation she receives is that her amnesia stems from and accident, and as she asks further she is only more concerned.<br /><br />Each day she retains what she has learned, but each morning she wakes up to the very same confusion. Ben leaves the house the same time each day, while Christine attempts to put her life together. A call from a young Dr. Nash, changes her life. At her meeting with him, she actually finds she has been secretly visiting him to help her find the answers. One of his recommendations is that she writes in a journal daily, everything she does and anything she remembers of her prior life. He agrees to call her daily once her husband has left the house to remind her to look in her diary. As she continues on this mind-bending journey, each day as she receives her call to look at the journal, she is always surprised at the notation on the first page. She cannot remember what it means. 'Do not trust Ben.' What could that possibly mean?<br /><br />As the journal becomes her lifeline to the world, she finds bits of scattered memory returning. She finds that her loving husband has been lying to her, not only was her injury caused in a more horrifying way than he described, but she has a son as well. When asked about her best friend, his response was to assure her that she had moved away and that they had lost contact. This too appears to be a lie. Why is this happening, Christine tries to find her own answers, yet she must begin at the very start each day. Danger seems to hang in the air. Is that oppressive doom coming from Ben, her husband of 22 years, or is there more about Dr. Nash then meets the eye.<br /><br />Watson has done an admirable job at creating the hopelessness of feeling that comes to Christine as an amnesiac. Each day starts over with fear and concern, and even as she follows her clues to prepare her daily ritual, she is obsessed with finding out more. Almost afraid to sleep each night knowing what the next day will bring, she begins to rely on her journal, writing in it obsessively. It is her life and her memories and there is fear of the unknown should it disappear. Her husband is still in the dark about her visits with Dr. Nash, and her small bits of recurring memories. She is not sure why, he is so patient and loving with her, yet she struggles to trust him.<br /><br />The terror slowly builds as you immerse yourself in the hopelessness of the situation, and you feel both the pain and joys experienced as Christine begins to find pieces of her life. The story sucks you in for a roller coaster of emotion, and Watson keeps you guessing as to the suspense that is building. Each step drags you further into the morass, urging Christine forward and yet warning her away. The dialogue takes you into her heart and mind, creating a relationship that seems personal. Can Christine find the answers before the danger strikes?<br /><br />If you enjoy a good suspense, this book delivers. It is a quick paced and depth filled look at both hopelessness and dreams. The characters are well-written and quite charismatic. Following Christine, even with her slight despondency, she never stopstrying to find the answers. You have to admire her tenacity, and she leaves a lasting impression.<br /><br />I would recommend the book for a reading club. Christine's life is both interesting and informative. The discussion could create a great deal of dialogue within a group. Before I Go To Sleep would be a great addition to your library, one of those stories that you could read repeatedly and still find information you may have missed.<br /><br />This book was received free through the authors publicist.

0316098337|4.0|This is one of those books I just couldn't put down; I read it in one night. Having not read any reviews before I purchased the book, I was unsure what to anticipate and half expected to quickly become annoyed by a novel written in the voice of a small child. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Emma did an outstanding job of capturing the family dynamics between mom and boy while cleverly allowing the reader to experience the ordeal through the innocence of a child -- who illustrates his small world as though he's drawing a picture of a loved one. Had the book been written in any other point-of-view, it would've lost its charm. I found the first half of the book to be the most appealing, as the room quickly became one of my favorite \\"characters\\" in the story -- because Jack loved it so much. Once we lost the room, it was like losing a piece of him. But the loss was for a good cause. The ending was strong, and left me wanting more. All in all, I very much enjoyed the book and found it to be one of the more original works I've read this year. I'm looking forward to reading more of Emma's writing.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|To start off, the blu ray transfer is like no other on this disc here! The picture is crystal clear, and the sound is unmistakably beautiful. The movie, was very good, although I did have on little problem with it. Towards the end, as they show The American and Colonel Nicholson's characters going through different troubles. They show the building of the bridge and then they switch to the American's rescued life and the planning to blow up the bridge. Frankly, I didn't give a damn about the American and felt that they stressed his story line too much. I would've loved to see more on the organization of the men and the building of the bridge itself. Also to show the American's team walking throughout the jungle could've been done in an easy montage sort of way, but I felt that they devoted too much time on the American's story when they didn't even set his character up that well in the beginning. I can't help but give this movie 5 stars, mainly on it's ending, because that's what truly makes this movie great. Perhaps not all that Oscar worthy, but definitely a great flick.

0307454541|5.0|A friend who had just read Dragon Tattoo mentioned to me that she had to battle through the first 50-60 pages before the story became interesting; this was great to know or I may have taken months to get through the book.<br /><br />Hang in there through the clutter of names, organizations and depressed journalist story and you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the novel is how the story develops complexity. There are a few story lines to follow along with, and eventually, it is revealed how they all come together.<br />The book had some exciting, unexpected twists, and once I made it past the initial slow pace, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This book is NOT for children or young adults. Sex and sexual abuse are brought up frequently in the novel, and although it is not always in detail, enough is said to create haunting images. For me personally, this was the only downside of the novel...the graphic sexual deviance. However, it is essential to the story line, and despite it all, a really great read.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!
B0027WNRIG|5.0|But I confess that I like the sound of the Gold Disc version better.  My friends insist that you can't really tell the difference without extremely good speakers, so perhaps I am just being sentimental.  However, this remaster sounds great regardless of which version is better; very clean if more middy than the Gold version.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|Conditions is heartfelt. The musicians are talented and the lyrics are beautiful. Listening to this album is a true pleasure.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book (and series overall) has a strong, unique premise and follows through with raw, minimalistic detail, which lends itself to the young adult reader. However, it is entirely appropriate and appealing for adults. I particularly appreciated how I continued to think about the books long after they were done. I can see how and why this distopian series has exploded onto the literary scene with such force and sense of modern classic. The only flaw that stopped up the flow from time to time was the way the main character was too often blind to the feelings and motivations of others (of which the reader was well aware). However, being that it is a young adult series, this could be considered a flaw of the young character (vs. the writing).     All in all, this series is well worth the read in its entirety.
0553381695|4.0|This book is much, much better than its predecessor, mainly because there is a huge improvement in the pacing. Looking back, Game of Thrones is definitely about setting up arranging all the pieces to be in position for the action that follows in the sequel. While that seemed tedious at times, Clash of Kings definitely makes it worth the effort to get through. Twists and turns continue as the people of Westros play the Game of Thrones for control of the Seven Kingdoms. What strikes me the most (in a good way) about Kings is the way that Martin manages to deftly juggle subplot upon subplot. While the lords of the Seven Kingdoms jockey for power in an all-out war, North of the Wall the Black Brothers are tracking down a mystery that may change the face of the civil war in the south. Meanwhile, the East, across the Narrow Sea, the last scion of the former King is on a magical and exotic journey through a land that seems bizarre to say the least compared to Westros, a place where magic is born again and dangers lurk around every corner. Martin does a fantastic job at selecting characters for points of view of the action on all sides and each chapter ends on a tantalizing note that makes you want to continue forward. Again, the pacing is really good and just when you're about to find out what happens to Bran, we're whisked away to the other end of the world to find out what's happening with Daenerys. In spite of how that sounded, it's not annoying, and the title of each chapter brings all the action that was left off the last time we saw that character rushing back, making you eager to continue. Martin is politically savvy, does intrigue really, really well and manages to build likable, but extremely round characters. There are no fantasy archetypes here. They're buried under layers and layers of flaws that make some of the characters endearing, and others utterly repulsive.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? As much as an improvement this book was to the pacing of the series, it could still have used some heavy editing, particularly when it comes to the elaborate and inane descriptions of EVERY single meal that anyone sits down to eat. Every. Single. One. I get it. It's period-accurate and all that jazz, but you convinced me of that in the first book and through other aspects of this one. I don't need to know that Cersei is sitting down to a seven course meal with a three page long description of each of the courses as if I'm perusing the menu at a fine dining restaurant only to be confronted with the meal that Tyrion is eating in the middle of the next chapter. Were you hungry when you wrote this? Seems like it. Anyway, the descriptions just became tedious and I found myself skimming whenever Martin started to mention food. Two books in and I also still can't get used to the very uncomfortable descriptions of rape that seem remarkably casual given the gravity of the act. Again, I understand the whole Alan Moore of Fantasy effect he's going for, but at times, it seems tasteless and with all of Westros at war looting and pillaging neighbors, there were lots of moments that I felt were unnecessarily graphic. Yes, war is brutal and medieval medicine and gender roles and relations being what they were, etc., etc., but do you really have to take every opportunity possible to be so blunt about it? Call me a boy scout, but I just get tired of it after a while. I don't want or expect a G rated Fantasy. I like the grittiness of the series and its realism, but, as with Thrones, I just feel like sometimes it goes overboard.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my personal proclivities aside, this is a very intelligent and suspenseful work of fiction that leaves other contemporary fantasy in the dust. It's intricate, well-developed and littered with amazing characters and page-turning tension. Well worth your time, even if fantasy is outside your usual reading ground.ld still have used some heavy editing, particularly when it comes to the elaborate and inane descriptions of EVERY single meal that anyone sits down to eat.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I cannot believe the strength of this 11 year old girl and her will to survive such terror.  Her innocence taken without her consent and the means she used to endure the physical, sexual and mental abuse at the hand of such a vile excuse for a human being.  If you want to read a book that will move to fear, cry, get angry and finally smile this is for you.  You will cringe at some points but hang on to the end so that you can bathe in the sunshine of her healing.  You will feel so good about how this young woman finally escaped and turned her life and the lives of her children into lives worth living.  She does not feel sorry for herself but is grateful to be alive and have a chance to live a normal life.

B004EK91LQ|5.0|I will offend by saying this...but Avatar is WEAK compared to the 3D effects that were done in this movie. The story...of course simple and trite. That is NOT why we watch a movie like this. It's ALL about the DANCING!!! This is the best of the series. Step Up 4 is coming out...and I hope it doesn't blow it...but the trajectory has been on an upward climb...so I don't think so. Watching this in 3D (RECOMMENDED!!!) just adds to the brilliance of the moves!
B004YXE438|5.0|Great puzzle game with lots of different images (levels) to complete.  You get 4 sizes to choose from and 3 difficulty (how much help they provide to let you know when a piece is in the correct spot) options.
B003SHYVO8|4.0|Luv this series. Luv the dancing. When you want to escape...just pop this in and be ready to groove out of your mind! Really cool movie!!
B005FDWM6M|5.0|A Little Princess is truly an amazing story that will make you cry tears of joy and tears of sadness throughout the entire movie!
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Was excited to get this in the mail before we went on vacation so we would have something to watch in case of a rainy day.  Well we did get the rainy day but were let down when we put the movie in and settled in for a laugh.  Parts here and there were funny but my kids may have watched 10 minutes of the whole movie due to lack of interest.  Would advise people to rent before buying....
B0011WABIW|5.0|Pink Floyd created a place in music history with their ability to mix creative songs with their ability to wail on a guitar!

B004EPYZP8|3.0|Ryan Philippe has a habit of playing opposite more charismatic male stars,here against Mathew McConaughey,in Breach it was as understudy to a mole(Chris Cooper) in the FBI.In both films he ostensibly tries to outsmart andmanipulate more experienced men.For Mick Haller (McConaughey),a Los Angeles criminal defence lawyer,who operates out of the back of his Lincoln Towncar,having spent his life defending petty gutter-variety criminals,unexpectedly lands the chance of a lifetime,defending a rich kid realtor,who is accused of attempted rape and murder.Part of the conflict in this film is that Mick, being bound by attorney-client confidentiality rules, can't go to the police or the DA. Roulet(Philippe) broke into his house, threatened his family, stole his gun (of course, that isn't proven, but circumstantial is strong), and his friend/investigator is murdered and he is being framed for it... and still, Mick has no options other than to keep quiet? The whole point of the film is the way Haller dealt with the problem. He outplayed Roulet. It wasn't very realistic but it was entertaining! You also have the fact that his current case was connected to another one of his client's cases.Not sure how that would complicate things but he also has a responsibility to that client.His current client actually confessed to a murder involving that client:the sight of Michael Peña, as one of Mick's old clients,going from freaked-out innocent to stone-cold lifer in a few short scenes.    Ms. Tomei plays a character and not just the love interest. She isn't the star, of course, but without her and the other exceptionally well-cast supporting players, Mr. McConaughey would have a tougher time making you believe that he was to the sleaze born. After his breakthrough in A Time To Kill, either he or his management team fell into the familiar Hollywood trap of following the money rather than following the talent. Here, he infuses life into a wonderfully seedy character, a lived in quality. Mick's confidence about his place in the social food chain is upended by a building sense of doubt and guilt, culminating in telling moment when he says, \\"There's no client as scary as an innocent man.\\". Mick's descent into self-questioning limbo ends up tainting the lives of his straggly haired investigator (William H. Macy) and his district attorney ex-wife (Marisa Tomei), the few fledgling branches making up his hollow family tree. and Furman can't help but drench the film in unnecessary lens flares, split screens, and jump cuts. All the twists and turns add up to little more than an anti-climactic showdown and a simplistic moral awakening,with the cheasy ending of sucking it to a repeat client next time.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I love Ender's Game.  The first book is truly remarkable.  The characters, plot, everything screams sci-fi, and it is really hard for me to explain how great this book, and book series is.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can't really explain the idea of this book, sort of a mash-up dystopian society meets science fiction.  This book reminds me a lot of Ender's Game, following the life of what I would consider to be a child into a war game created by adults.  Perhaps the consequences aren't as dire as those that face Ender Wiggin, but Suzanne Collins' ability to create an emotional involvement with Katniss Everdeen propels you to flip through the pages.    What a great series, and I have high hopes for the movies!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|this romantic science fiction film will keep you guessing untile the end,. this is one of matt damon's best movies i've ever seen. this was a very good movie. the story was awesome and so was the actors. if you have not watched this movie then i recommend you do
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I took a break from the Harry Potter movies after I saw the fourth, which I believe was one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. I find the book itself to be perhaps the weakest of the series (at least in its contribution to the seven-book narrative), and the film adaptation seemed more interested in simply realizing as many scenes in the book as possible rather than creating a coherent story.     After seeing the Deathly Hallows movies, however, I decided to view movies five and six to see if David Yates did as brilliant a job as he did with book seven. He did. With Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince he was not afforded the luxury of a two-part release, but these films are nevertheless excellent films.     Fans of the series complain that Yates acted as a rather poor surgeon on the book, using a meat cleaver to ineptly amputate scenes from Rowling's book. These fans miss the point. The Harry Potter movies are designed as summer blockbusters, not as realizations of the books. The movies must merely capture the essence of the book, and present the plot as coherently as possible. I believe Yates to be the only Potter director to understand this. When this concept is understood, I think disappointed fans will find that many scenes they thought they lost actually ARE in the film. I will give but one example:    There is no opening scene between the two ministers.     True, but what, really, was the point of this scene? As a Muggle, the Prime Minister offered those readers not obsessed with everything Potter to get a nice crash course in all things Wizard. In a film, we really do not have time to re-explain what has already been covered in five films. The other point of this scene was to show how Voldemort's rising power affects Muggles and Wizards alike. Do we really need Rowling's clunky dialogue between two men in an office to show this? Film is a visual medium, and the collapse of the pedestrian bridge over the Thames brilliantly depicts the terror growing in the non-Wizarding world.     If you're looking for the books, go to your bookshelf and read them. Half-Blood Prince is an excellent movie that not only captures the spirit of the book, but is also re-watchable. Highly recommended.
159335259X|3.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />This is the second book in the Harry Bosch series.  So far there are 17 in the series.  Bosch is a Los Angeles Homicide detective - very smart at his job.  He always solves the mystery and finds the killer.  His biggest problem is his superiors.  His immediate boss, former bosses, internal affairs, and others whom he has to work with never seem to like him and cause problems.  He doesn't play political games to win their favor.<br /><br />In this story a fellow homicide detective Moore is found dead in a hotel room - an apparent suicide.  Harry was on call that night and at the scene, but his superiors tell him not to investigate, they will handle it.  Another detective Porter is quitting the force.  Bosch is asked to go through Porter's group of unsolved cases and pick one to work on.  As a result, Harry discovers that Moore was murdered (not a suicide), and that there are links to two other murders.  All of these are linked to the designer drug called \\"Black Ice.\\"  Harry travels to Mexico to investigate the drug lord Zosia whom Bosch believes is behind the murders.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />This was better than the 1st book, but not as good as the 5th book (the only others I've read so far).  The first book had too many unlikeable characters.  This was a little better in that regard.  It's very much a police procedural.  Bosch is slowly uncovering clues.  I prefer a little more relationship development or interesting characters to pull me in.  This book is missing those, but it was a good story.  I wasn't bored.  Many interesting things happen.  The plot and events were well done.  The ending is happy for those I am pulling for.  It's very acceptable as an audiobook, keeping my mind occupied as I do other things.  I like it enough to do all the books in the series.  I think this could be read as a stand-alone.<br /><br />When Bosch did an illegal break-and-enter to investigate, I liked what he did so that the evidence would stay where it was until he could legally enter later with a warrant.  He did some other impressive things as well.<br /><br />CAUTION SEMI-SPOILER:<br />Something interesting:  In book 1, Bosch cared about a woman who committed a crime.  He insisted she turn herself in.  He put the law above his feelings for her.  In book 2, Bosch cared about a woman who was innocent.  Bosch kept a secret about someone else's actions in order to help her.  Bosch did not follow the law which would have meant exposing the secret.<br /><br />NARRATOR:<br />The narrator Dick Hill was pretty good here.  In two other books he used an \\"effeminate gay guy voice\\" for females which annoyed me.  His voice for females in this book was better.  And his voice for male characters was very good.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook length: 11 hrs and 11 mins.  Narrator: Dick Hill.  Swearing language: occasional use - strong.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|All things considered the PS3 is a pretty sweet system, but the controllers (as with those of the PSOne and PS2) never worked with my big hands (can't imagine any given their style over function design.  So here's the solution?  Kinda.  The layout, size and overall design owes a lot to the controllers of the Xbox 360, which is a good thing.  The analog sticks also share their location with the 360, which again is a good thing in my mind.  So far, so good.<br /><br />The rest is a mixed bag.  The build is ok, but not great (you'll know it's a 3rd party controller), the texture is less than ideal, the button & stick (big dead zone) quality is a bit sub-par, and the required dongle is also a minus (it's more of a Sony semi-proprietary issue than anything).  The built in rechargeable battery and straight-forward USB charging cable is a plus, and battery life is respectable, as is charging time.<br /><br />Overall, it's a solid buy if you're looking for a 360 style controller for the PS3, but it's not perfect.
030788743X|5.0|I don't write many reviews. In fact, I don't write reviews at all, but having just devoured Ready Player One in a few hours, I felt compelled to.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a geeky book. There is no denying it. Cline tries to explain obscure 80s cultural references and technical jargon. These explanations can be a bit annoying if you're already familiar with them, but I don't blame Cline for trying to make the book a bit more accessible outside of geek circles.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I inhaled this book in one long breath. The pace was fast though the characters were perhaps underdeveloped. Even so, I think a lot of geeks will self-identify with the characters which makes the book all the more enjoyable. I know I did.<br /><br />As much as I love stories where the future is, well, futuristic, Ready Player One paints a far more realistic picture of a world where oil is outrageously expensive and humanity has escaped into virtual worlds. Crime, poverty and the inventive perverseness of the human psyche thrives.<br /><br />However, this isn't a dark book, but an adventure and a very fun one at that.

B004L3AQLU|3.0|Jake Gylenhall and Anne Hathaway are pleasing as mismatched lovers in this extremely loose adaptation of the bestselling nonfiction book. But...is it a romantic comedy? A disease of the week movie? A toothless satire of Big Pharma? The satire was doomed to fail from the get-go, what with the obvious fortune in product placement that Pfizer put into it.
1451629184|5.0|This book was received in perfect new condition.  I read it in two days.  The book was written from a little girl's perspective, using a young girl's vocabulary.  It may at times seem childish, but then you remember that this woman was kept away from worldly things and intentionally kept a little girl to keep her under his control.
B000GQOTBO|1.0|This book was not in the shape it was represented to be in.  It was very worn and it was written in.  That is not how it was described.  I was very disappointed!
B0015DROBO|1.0|After hearing all of the hype I HAD to read this book - or should I say attempt to read this book.  I could not get into this one, too many characters, too much background info, etc.  I finally skimmed tfrough to about the half way point and went on from there.  It was an OK book, not worth all of the rave reviews it got.

0452286751|1.0|Anyone rememembers Mills & Boon, the cheap, formulaic romances some of us used to read obsessively in our mid-teens, where all the men had broad shoulders and narrow waists and the women were wildly beautiful, and all their interactions were intense and melodramatic with meaningful glances and unspoken truths? And as silly little girls we fantasised about being part of the world?<br /><br />Well, thank goodness I've grown up! And having done so (by more than just a few years!) I thought it was time to read something of Ayn Rand's. THE Ayn Rand. I did not know what to expect, I'd heard snippets here and there about her controversial philosophy and her two famous novels but never much more. So with great anticipation I picked up The Fountainhead and thought that the chunky 700+ pager would be just the ticket for this summer.<br /><br />What I did not expect was melodrama and caricature people barely a notch above Mills  & Boon! At 150 pages I thought, Surely it must get better. But it hasn't. Oh, the meaningful glances in which the unrealistic characters instantly read oh so much,  the depth of emotions and staggering self-awareness possessed by characters who paradoxically know no shades of grey, how everything happens just at the righ time - the encounters, the new commissions... Good grief!<br /><br />But I plugged away. I'm loath to leave a book unfinished plus my desire to be able to have an informed opinion dictated that I actually finish the book. So I started skimming, hoping to get to the better parts faster. Another 100+ pages later (more than a third into the book) it's time to face the truth: this is not working for me. Instead of enjoyable summer reading, I'm spending my time in frustration - just to be able to say that I've read Ayn Rand?<br /><br />The other thing about growing older is the realisation that there's too many (good) books and too little time. I'm throwing in the towel with this one and going in search of something more rewarding.<br /><br />(I wonder if I'd do better with the movie....)movie....)
B000TGJ80S|5.0|4.5 stars out of 5 (plus a half-star for a fantastic Collector's Edition DVD)<br /><br />Dracula is Bram Stoker's classic tale of gothic horror and romance which is considered one of the definitive works in English literature.  It really put vampires on the map as one of the world's most well-known monsters, with the infamous Count of the book's title becoming the most famous vampire of all time.  In film Dracula has become the most used villain of all time, appearing in an estimated 217 films over the last 100 years, and has been portrayed by screen legends that include Bela Legosi, Christopher Lee, and Frank Langella.  The only character with more appearances on film is detective Sherlock Holmes (233 films).<br /><br />Despite his high number of screen appearances very few films have actually attempted an accurate reconstruction of Stoker's novel.  That is until legendary director Francis Ford Coppola came along in 1992.  The legendary director who had brought the world The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now has a rough spot during the 1980s and was determined to make a comeback by bringing Dracula to the screen in a way that focused more on the concepts of gothic romance than horror.  Even more shocking, he decided he would do this only utilizing the same special effects wizardry that would have been available to the pioneers of cinema back in the years Bram Stoker wrote his landmark novel.<br /><br />Bram Stoker's Dracula was finally released in 1992 is at its heart an art film first, a story second.  Sure, it is to date the most accurate adaptation of Dracula ever committed to film, but as narrative it does have flaws.  It makes up for these flaws with Francis Ford Coppola's incredible, uncompromising vision of the notorious bloodsucker.  Is it a perfect adaptation of Stoker's work?  Not really, but for the most part it succeeds at separating itself from the countless other adaptations.<br /><br />Count Dracula is without a doubt the most well-known villain in English literature.  Everyone knows who and what Dracula is.  With such a famous character of both literature and film, Coppola had to think hard about the casting of Dracula, and he succeeded with his choice of British actor Gary Oldman.  Oldman was, and remains to this day the chameleon of Hollywood.  Give him a role, a background, and an accent and he will dissolve into just about any role and he does just that with his portrayal of Dracula.<br /><br />Most of the film naturally follows the well-known story of Dracula's arrival in London to begin corrupting and feeding off Mina Harker (Winona Ryder) and the ill-fated Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost).  What separates this from previous adaptations is Coppola's direction, which aside from taking artistic liberties, puts a much greater emphasis on the sexual aspects of Stoker's novel.<br /><br />Oldman's Dracula is a far more tragic character than previous incarnations.  Coppola's film takes liberties in giving Dracula an origin story; providing reasons for why he is the way he is.  A gorgeously shot opening reveals that Dracula (as his real-life inspiration Vlad III the Impaler)  he was a devoted man of God, viciously slaughtering men to protect the church.  But when his beloved takes her own life and is thus denied entry into eternal salvation Dracula raises his sword against the cross, renouncing God and swearing to live off the blood of others.  This entire sequence, highlighted by Wojciech Kilar's fantastic score provides one of the film's best moments, and also helps separate it from the countless other attempts at adapting Dracula to the screen.<br /><br />Special note does need to be given to Wojciech Kilar's score, which was sadly not nominated for an Oscar.  Lots of his themes really drive home this movie's imagery.  His score radiates a feeling of dread and evil, yet still manages to give off that feeling of seduction that is so inherent of Dracula.  At times, especially in the prologue, I can even hear bits that seem to be borrowed by Howard Shore in his soundtrack for The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I am very proud to own this film's soundtrack and listen to it on a frequent basis.<br /><br />Production is top of the line with Michael Ballhaus' cinematography mixed with the on-screen (or \\"naïve\\") special effects helping to create a film that both feels new and old at the same time.  Throughout the film you'll constantly be asking \\"How on earth did they do that?\\" or \\"Oh, I see what they did there!  Awesome!\\"  The real magic of Bram Stoker's Dracula rests in its visual trickery.  If you don't have any other reason to see this adaptation, give it a watch just to see what the crew was able to accomplish without digital effects.<br /><br />But, sadly the film is not perfect, and I would be called out if I were not to mention its flaws.  Aside from Oldman, and perhaps Anthony Hopkins, the acting is very unbalanced.  Winona Ryder is fairly bland as Mina, as is Sadie Frost as Lucy.  Even Hopkins as Van Helsing at times seems to be phoning it in, but he does work in the role because, if for no other reason, he's Anthony friggin Hopkins.<br /><br />The crown jewel of the films weakness comes in the form of Keeanu Reeves in what is easily the film's worst casting decision (perhaps even the worst performance of Reeves' career...).  I know it's popular to beat on Reeves wooden acting, and I don't want to seem like I'm jumping on the band wagon but: it's Keeanu Reeves as a turn of the century British gentlemen, complete with a cheap, unbelievable accent.  I'm sorry, but this really couldn't work and I wonder what good old Coppola was thinking.<br /><br />Also, aside from some of the acting flaws, towards the end of the film the narrative begins to become a tad bit jumbled, as if they started running out of time to shoot more transition scenes.  It isn't obvious, or confusing, but the pacing does seem to take off on a sprint once Dracula begins his seduction of Mina.<br /><br />So what is my final verdict?  While Coppola's Dracula certainly have its flaws it does manage to make up for them with its striking imagery and by digging into the sexual aspects of Dracula that other films had shied away from.  It is a flawed masterpiece to be sure, but for someone with as visual a mind as me it is hard not to love the film for what it is.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition includes an introduction and commentary by director Francis Ford Coppola, but the second disc provides the juiciest features with over an hour's worth of featurettes exploring the creation of the film.  Given the non-existent features of the single-disc release I highly suggest investing in the Collector's Edition if you have the intent of adding this film to your collection.undtrack for The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|The main reason I look at reviews nowadays is to see if a new release is a loudness-war victim.    Sadly, like accelerate, this is another casualty of the insanity.     If the \\"music industry\\" want people to start paying for music again their first objective ought to be to not put stuff out that sounds like crap.     Unfortunately more often than not these days I'll read a review like some of these and won't go buy an album I'd normally buy just on principle.
B0051MKMNC|3.0|Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is having a good night. The best in a long time. An old friend turned him on to a new favorite. Nothing better than a dealer who's high....Be high, convince Eddie to try! And Eddie Morra does indeed try.<br /><br />Turns out this highly addictive new favorite is an experimental drug that Eddie's old friend has somehow gotten his hands on and there are some rough and tough people that also want their hands on it. So when Eddie winds up with a significant stash of this new favorite these rough and tough people now want to get their hands on Eddie. But Eddie has an advantage over his foes you see...the new favorite unlocks the full (superhuman?) potential of the brain, which according to the movie humans only use 20% of. Ah...well that explains why I spend so much time writing reviews for no pay!<br /><br />Limitless was a pretty fast paced entertaining movie. Limited special effects are very good, and there are some very cool camera special effects at the start of the film (that actually get a little monotonous by the end of the film). While the pills that Eddie was taking were easy to swallow, a lot of the plot line was not. I mean for starters, this would be a pretty breakthrough, highly secret and tightly secured and scrutinized discovery. So let's say even if someone very high up in the pharma company manufacturing the drug was interested in the intentional or inadvertent leak to the public of the drug in such large quantities, it would not be as easy as Limitless makes it seem like it is. But if you don't think too much about this and some other plot line flaws and inconsistencies, you have pretty good movie here.<br /><br />So the movie all in all is a pretty fun ride and we see Eddie become an addict of perhaps the most irresistible narcotic to ever be discovered. If you don't think that you would ever get addicted to this drug, you can't understand a user's mind. You could try with your books and degrees, but if you let yourself go and open your mind I'll bet you'd be doing like Eddie. And it ain't so bad.and open your mind I'll bet you'd be doing like Eddie.

0307595579|5.0|My wife wanted these books, okay, but i started reading them after she finished.  Good Stories!  Only the first book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a little slow in the first 50 pages.  A master story teller.
1401323820|5.0|As a fan of the Castle TV Series I wanted to give this book a try. I wasn't expecting it to be any good at all, especially having seen the reviews on how \\"thin\\" it was and other bad press.    This is a story that anyone can read, even if you don't watch the show. It's a basic crime novel but is a very intelligently written one. It doesn't expect you to know the characters so if you've never watched the show in your life don't let that put you off. This is a fun mystery book. Yes it's thin, but it's also got substance. I've read mystery/crime novels that were long and very boring. It's not the size that counts! To whomever the writer is, thank you!     It is a must read for any Castle fan. Those who watch the show will laugh at the little touches that are obviously based on the TV characters. Even the dedication & thank you's are fun.     Regardless, it is a fun little novel for anyone wanting a quick witty crime style read. I couldn't put it down & can't wait to read the next book!     Surprisingly, I do recommend this!
0451450523|5.0|The last unicorn is unlike any kind of fantasy book I've ever read. The world is so fanciful that I feel like I must cling to the narrative or be swept away by a world that simply does not have the same rules for reality. Beautifully worded and touching to the core.

B004C4IKCU|5.0|I had the original vinyl album (guess that dates me!) but this is just as grest as the original. The collection also combines \\"Something For Everyboday\\" (got that original, too!)along with 5 bonus tracks. It would be impossible to pick out  any one song to say it's the best. Elvis sings with feeling, sexuality and you can can tell he was enjoying every minute of it! A must fo every Elvis fan and a \\"must try\\" for those of you who only know \\"Hound Dog\\" & his early standards. Listen to this & you'll experience the beautiful God given voice & talent that is truly Elvis Presley!
0307946711|1.0|After reading this for my book club, I feel obliged to warn others to stay away.  This poorly written book conjures memories of a high school schoolboys attempt to write about girls.  The story is weak, and the repetitive, short (but not witty) conversations lack the fluidity necessary to carry this failing plot.    The characters long, drawn-out misery and denial of love lose their attractiveness after only a few chapters.  And it becomes painfully clear early on that the two main characters will eventually reunite, but only after many unnecessary and unproductive years of unconvincing and unimaginative fighting.  The characters are unattractive (not physically but emotionally) and continue as such through out the whole story.  Frankly, I couldn't care if these two immature and annoying individuals ever did reunite.  The only positive element was the ex-boyfriend, but even he lost appeal in the end.  Further, the ending \\"ruins\\" this book (if that is possible).  It is weak, unexplained and too smart for its own benefit.    If you are looking for a romantic, witty, interesting, fun or interesting read, this is NOT the book for you.
1250004349|3.0|This book started so well.  It gets your attention very early on and holds it... until it runs out of steam a somewhere beyond the half-way mark. De Rosnay tells two stories that unlimately converge.  One burrows into the history of French officialdom's craven collaboration in the roundup and deportation of Jews in World War II.  Deftly and vividly she conveys the cruelty and terror of it all, seen through the eyes of a child.  The other story is that of a contemporary character who sets out to find out what happened to the child and to do what she can to honor her suffering.  But once the author has set the scene, it seems like she doesn't know where to go with it.  The modern-day story, the thinner of the two, takes over: it eventually dissolves ino vapidness.  A trite (and wholly predictable) ending does little justice to the power of what precedes it. Sadly, this is a book that started with a great idea but lost its way.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|If you are the type of person that likes a movie which makes you think; \\"your highness\\" is not for you.<br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid, but I honestly had a lot of entertainment. I recommend if you want to get some laughs.

B00006JU7T|4.0|Shot on location, this 1973 classic really captures the look of downtown NYC in those days when streets were dirty and most of Manhattan had not been gentrified. Al Pacino stands way above all the other little actors here in his skills as the only cop in NYC not on the take. I just wish the extras had included an interview with the real Serpico who is alive and living in upstate on the royalties from the Peter Maas book and this movie. The score is a bit dated here, but overall this has really stood up well to time. And, despite police denials, I have no doubt that graft still  exists in the NYPD of today.

B005869U6G|5.0|I've been an Incubus fan since S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and one of the things that has kept me a fan is the fact that every album is different and they never cease to amaze me with their depth and diversity. However, I have greeted every new Incubus album with an air of indifference that required a few listens before I finally accepted it fully.<br /><br />The same is true of this album (that's why I waited a month to write my review).<br /><br />True, every song is slow and ballad-like, but that just shows the band's transformation over the years. Incubus has always been a band with meaningful, profound lyrics, but they were often easily ignored because of the instrumentals and turntables. This album forces you to listen to the lyrics because they remove all of the excess. That's the best way I could put it. This is a minimalist Incubus album.<br /><br />So, listen to the full album start to finish at least 3 times. And when you listen, really pay attention to the lyrics, listen to Boyd's voice, listen to the soft instrumentals, and think about the amount of courage and talent it must have taken to make such a transformation.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple: True Blood Season 1, like all the other seasons on Blu-Ray, is quite amazing. The audio quality is very rich, as it is very warm, and video quality is what you'd expect from a Blu-Ray disc. I use my PlayStation 3 for Blu-Ray viewing.<br /><br />As for the show itself, True Blood is highly addictive and unlike any on the market right now. Keep the Vampire Diaries and Twilight junk for the kids. And for anyone that reviews the show with one-star because it's nothing like the Sookie Stackhouse books, well, get over it. The Harry Potter movies weren't exactly like the books and look what they did for the box-office? The same could even be said about the Lord of the Rings. Just enjoy the show! Who enjoys a copy of a copy, of a copy, anyway? People could use a little change.
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|Rango has some great strengths but isn't an all around \\"family movie\\" that everyone will necessarily enjoy. How much you like it will depend on your expectations. The visuals are fascinating: the feel of the desert is captured really well, the animations of sand, water, and glass are fantastic, and the animations of the faces of the various animal characters are very memorable -- more so than most live action movies. And unlike most mainstream animated films, Rango is willing to use a variety of lighting for effect, such as a very \\"high key\\" desert dream sequence.    The plot and dialogue are unusual and the overall \\"feel\\" of the movie is a little dark, more in the direction of something like Coraline, definitely not a typical Disney or Pixar feel. I think many adults would find it funny or at least interesting, but small children would be either bored or scared. The trailer is definitely not representative of the movie, but that's not unusual.
B00005MP58|5.0|I finally purchased this after the price went down on Amazon and I knew I would not be disappointed. I LOVE this movie! After renting it so much, I felt I should break down and own my own copy. I have heard that this digitized DVD version is not the same picture quality as the original VHS version, but seeing as I have not owned a VHS player in forever, and as far as I know there is no newer \\"better\\" version more similar to the original VHS one, I will remain happy to watch this one over and over and over again. It is the perfect rainy day or sick day movie!
B0053Y9AXQ|3.0|These eight albums and various singles, all recorded between 1957 and 1960 represent the transition of Cooke from gospel star to one of the greatest soul singers of all time.  The songs range from jazz standards and broadway show-tunes to then current pop hits, and they are about the most mellow performances of Cooke's career.  The material on the albums represented has been available off and on through various RCA budget and repackaging offerings over the years, though initially most of it was issued on the Keen label.  The digital transfers are definitely from LP, and while in some cases they're a bit wanting, for the most part they're acceptable, especially considering the source and age of the recordings.  If you're looking for the hits, go to the ABKCO packages.  If you want the great gospel tracks, go to the Specialty packages.  But if you want some great late night Cooke, this is the place to find it.  The albums in the package are: Sam Cooke (1957), Encore (1958), Tribute to the Lady (1959), Hit Kit (1959), I Thank God (EP - 1960), Cooke's Tour (1960), Hit's of the '50's (1960), Swing Low (1960) and various singles released during the same period that were not included on these albums.  Unfortunately there are no liner notes or album cover reproductions, and the remastering is only okay, so it's three instead of four or five stars.  Maybe RCA or ABKCO will eventually find the time to do this package properly with remastering from the original tapes and thoughtful notes and cover reproductions, but in the meantime, this will have to suffice.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|The plot pieces used in this film are familiar but they are used so well that you are bound to come away uplifted and satisfied.    I watched this in English Language. The voice actors did a great job. No doubt there is a part of Japanese culture that is lost in translation, but it does not detract.    A cynic might say that the one thing we learn from this film is that every single person in Japan has some form of wifi game, even if only on a smartphone. Or maybe it's just this particular family?    Family connections, inclusiveness, balance, and the desire to overcome mankind-threatening AIs: these are values we can all cherish. Thank you, Summer Wars.
B001NB545Q|5.0|My title says it all... I sincerely think Who's Next should be recognized as the single greatest rock album ever recorded. I adore The Beatles and I love Zeppelin. These days I'm thoroughly infatuated with all things prog, from Genesis to Camel to Spock's Beard to Porcupine Tree, Echolyn, and Marillion. But nothing has ever grabbed me like The Who--and this record in particular. There are precious few albums even in the same category as Who's Next, and those that are rank behind this masterpiece, in my opinion.

I can't wait to read the rest of the series.

I realize that this is a typo, but it is frustrating none the less.  Hopefully, Amazon or the author will provide a correction free of charge.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author takes you through the awful experiences of a little Jewish girl living in France during World War II and an American journalist living in present day France who is attempting to piece together an article on the anniversary of these terrible events. Although this book is fiction, it isn't hard to imagine these things happening and scarier still to think of how the actions of Hitler had such an effect on other countries as well.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this pen (at the time it came with psychic paper as well) a while ago for my 10th Doctor cosplay.  It was thoroughly enjoyable, made the right noises, and overall a fun little toy to keep in my bag for work (working with STANDARD NERDS has its advantages).  Then came the day when I needed to go to court in a superior court building, and I forgot that the sonic screwdriver was in my bag...    And I spent the next 15 minutes explaining to a bemused security officer what a sonic screwdriver is.  No bright lights or alarms (thankfully), just a very confused security guard who was more amused by the weird-looking electronic pen than worried.    Other thoughts - would have preferred if the device were JUST a prop (though then it would have been even more awkward at security...) instead of having the detachable pen tips.  Could be slightly better designed, but for the price it's an amusing piece of Doctor Who memorabilia.     Also - not upgradable to utilize red-phase sonic harmonics.  May be subject to doppler shift at speeds in standard space approaching c, which can result in unintended results.  Please consult with a licensed contractor before using to hang cabinets.
0345528581|5.0|I am giving this book a 5 star rating because I have been using it to work out for the last 6 weeks and have had great success.  The book provides detailed workouts to perform and instructions on how to perform exercises.  The workouts and the exercises can all be performed virtually anywhere and only require 30 mins to complete so there is no excuse for missing a work out because you do not have access to equipment.  The workouts also provide a good balance and seem to workouts every muscle group.  Additionally, because the workouts require you to use only your own body I have seen big gains in my balance and flexibility since I began.      There are a few personal issues that I have with the workouts.  First the book does not associate any sort of aerobic activity into the program.  In fact the book even goes as far as to suggest that aerobic activity is a waste of time when getting in shape.  To counter this I make sure I still incorporate aerobic activities into my daily routine and I have found that it makes the workouts in the book even more satisfying.  The second personal issue I have with this book is that it dismisses the use of a gym or weights when working out.  I have worked out with weights for 15 years since I was playing football in high school.  In my experiences lifting weights I have found that there is a since of personal satisfaction you get from being able to lift a certain about out weight.  By just using my own body weight I do not get that same satisfaction.  For example, the satisfaction I receive from being able to bench press 3 plates (315 lbs) without a spot helping me was a great personal high for me.  Being able to do 5 or 6 one handed push-ups does not achieve the same sense of satisfaction.  Additionally, it is a lot easier when lifting weights or using an exercise machine to measure exactly how far you have developed your muscles.  With the exercises that use just body weight I have discovered that at times as I begin to fatigue myexercise form declines.  Therefore, even though I have done more repetitions of the excise than I could before I cannot take the same sense of satisfaction for it because I know my form was not correct.      Even with the above issues I have I would still recommend this book to anyone looking for a detailed workout plan that does not have easy access to a complex gym.  You will get results from this book and you will not have to spend a lot of money or time.  However, if you live next to a gym and have free membership or are rich and can afford to buy all the equipment in the world you might want to look for a book that will help you take advantage of that equipment.

Slower and melodic, yes, emo it is not. A beautiful vocal melody in the chorus stood out to me on my first listen and continues to be a strong point in the album as far as I'm concerned. I guess they can't be everything to everyone but any Trivium fan should love this album. 'Watch the World Burn' is another one of my favorites along with 'Forsake not the dream'. The only song I don't really care for is Dusk Dismantled.     Also the idea that this is an attempt to sound more mainstream strikes me as totally absurd. This album is as heavy as anything they've done.     Another thing to keep in mind is that the album is 18 tracks, so with that many songs it takes longer to get to know the songs and appreciate the album more. I bought the special edition which is worth it in my opinion. I really enjoyed the DVD and its worth another 5 bucks, especially for people who like to take a look at the creative process of the album and get to know the band a bit more.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Bought this stand to prop up my laptop to be level with my external monitor. The stand looks really nice and stylish.  One downside is that I think the stand is a tiny bit too high. Nothing to really complain about though. Below the laptop is an area where you can put some things under it. I have my speakers remote and external usb hub placed there.
0553801473|3.0|Not to the level of the first three books....not by far.  Dance was long, ponderous, with little action of forward movement. The characters were stuck....doing nothing.  Pages and pages of traveling on ships, pining for cute sellswords, worrying about food and making beds for wildings, etc.  The major characters are on the way to do something, but all we get is.....\\"on the way\\".<br /><br />What is most depressing is knowing that we have to wait for five years for the next book.....so I have to live with this bad taste in my mouth for that long.<br /><br />Dissapointing for Martin, who is a great writer, but better than the average book.
B0055PMUSU|1.0|Let me point out first that I respect and admire Bethany Hamilton for her strength and courage. Let me also point out that she is not the first, not the hardest ever stricken by tragedy. And finally that her story deserved something better than this soap opera...<br />Acting is lame at best, dialogues shallow , the actors are all beautiful, zero fat, caucasian beverly hills types, intelligent, caring, warm , nice, just never showing any defect whatsoever ...<br />The main actress, AnnaSophia Robb, has the athleticism of a dead fish, is half the size of the real Bethany,and nothing like her in character. A cute teen all right, the typical \\"material\\" for \\"teen crush\\" or \\"teen horror\\" cheap flicks..definitely out of place in a story like this one..<br />But the worst part is the offensive and misleading way in which religion is used in this cheap flick. I have respect for the role that religion has had in Bethany's recovery, and just because of that respect I am offended by the \\"valium for the masses\\" way in which religion is treated here. Instead of taking the chance to investigate, reflect or question on the \\"problem of evil\\" the story writers chose the disgusting approach of connecting it with \\"morals\\". In the first part of the movie Bethany disobeys her parents (very mildly, just going to a night surf party..) and prefers to spend her time training instead of going to Mexico on a charitable mission. But luckily a \\"shark on a mission\\" will soon amputate her arm to bring her back on the \\"good road\\" so that she never disobeys her parents again, and goes on to relieve the sorrows of the poor people hit by the tsunami... This is a perfect compendium of the sick way in which religion is used to keep adults in an childish state of mind. Obey the authority or you will be punished, and if something evil happens is just because you were not obedient enough...and I won't even go into the hypocrisy of thinking that a trip to visit the tsunami stricken populations or the poor people in mexico could do anything useful for something other than one's won ego...<br />In the end \\"Bethany\\" is asked if she could go back would she still go surfing the day she got attacked by the shark? First: I know journalist are often idiots, but can you conceive a dumbest question??  Second: she goes on answering \\"Yes, I would, because that gave me the chance to embrace more people than I could have with two arms\\". Please. That might have been a great sentence if it was \\"Of course I would not, you dumbass! Who would be so idiotic to go have his arm chopped by a shark?? But I am still glad that this sad accident has given me the chance to embrace more people than I could do with two arms..\\" This part reminds me of a genial italian comedian, Massimo Troisi.. he plays a scene in one of his movies in which he reacts a little skeptically to a priest trying to convince him that disgraces in life are actually a gift that God makes to his beloved ones. And when the priest, seeing his incredulity, says: \\"I will pray for you\\", Troisi answer \\"Please no, or He might give some gift to me as well.. \\" :)<br />[...]<br />If you have any respect for strength, courage in front of adversities, spirituality and intelligence stay away from this trash ...ico could do anything useful for something other than one's won ego...  In the end \\"Bethany\\" is asked if she could go back would she still go surfing the day she got attacked by the shark?

B0035XQW74|5.0|I feel like a total fool for waiting over 7 months to finally give Law Abiding Citizen a viewing.  I had the opportunity to watch it back in January but I kept putting it off until this afternoon.  What a terrible decision on my part!  Law Abiding Citizen is awesome.    A man (Gerard Butler's character) answers the door one night and a robber breaks in.  He then ties up Gerard Butler and kills his daughter and wife.  Later, when the robber/murderer is correctly identified, Jamie Foxx (playing the role of a lawyer) allows the bad guy to go free.  This of course, hurts Gerard Butler's feelings; watching the man who murdered his family walk free with no punishment whatsoever.   So what does he do?    He gets revenge 10 years later.  Of course he doesn't call it revenge, but whatever.  Without spoiling too much, Gerard Butler eventually finds the man who murdered his family and tortures the living *heck* out of him.  Now the way the torture segment takes place requires viewers to suspend disbelief because it's almost impossible for all the events to fall into place correctly to allow everything concerning the bad guy to go as planned.  I'm of course referring to a certain phone call that encourages the bad guy to run along the rooftops of the buildings and assume he's being led to safety.  This entire segment is hard to believe and you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch the movie.  I don't want to say exactly how everything falls into place, but yeah- you already know it's a movie and not reality anyway.  At least I HOPE so. :)    It doesn't end there either.  While locked up in jail, Gerard Butler messes with Jamie Foxx's character by telling him how he's going to be prosecuted.  At first it seems like the character of Gerald Butler is absolutely crazy the way he's able to dictate his own fate, so to speak.  Soon, it's revealed he has an accomplice.  At least I *think* so.  I don't recall actually seeing him.   I just LOVE the way Gerard Butler is able to completely take over the entire FBI, the police department and everybody else, and continue his little rampage of violence all the while being locked up in jail!    Anyway, it's important to note that once Gerard Butler is arrested for torturing the man who murdered his family, the movie does NOT turn into a typical lawyer film.  This is most certainly a suspense/action packed movie the way Gerard Butler continues to take out his anger on those who may have been even SLIGHTLY in any way, shape or form connected to his family's murder.  Yes we're dealing with a lunatic here, haha.      Overall, I loved it.  Nonstop excitement is in store for you, I can promise you that.
1416550550|1.0|I ordered The Forgotten Garden last month and still have not received it.   The book was ordered on July 15 and the e-mail I received stated to expect   delivery between August 4 to 24.

Your previous  attempt for me to rate this source would not let me send a reply due to the   fact that August 24 is not here yet.
B0007GFFVQ|5.0|Music for Films is probably Brian Eno's second best ambient album behind Another Green World.  This is because you can actually take it two ways- you can enjoy it from a melody stand point *or* as background music.  These two albums give you an option which I personally find *very* appealing because most ambient musicians aren't capable of accomplishing both.    The only difference between this and Another Green World is that... well again, there's two differences.  One is that there's no vocal melodies in sight.  It's strictly instrumental.  Two, there's not nearly as much diversity this time around which explains why I can't quite give in and lay down a 5-star rating for Music for Films.    That doesn't mean the music on here won't fill your head with all kinds of wild, adventurous scenarios.  It will.  My favorite track is probably \\"Slow Water\\".  If you don't actually know this song, it's not as boring as the song title implies.  It's a slow-moving instrumental piece that almost sounds like a piano ballad of sorts, but it's melodic and just unusually pleasant.      The same kind of imagery applies with \\"Alternative 3\\" except this song is MUCH creepier.  The piano is one noticeable aspect, but it's the other exceptionally bizarre arrangements that strike me as downright frightening.  These two songs are my favorites.  Oh, and \\"Two Rapid Formations\\" is totally unique thanks to the way the electric guitar is played.     My gut feeling tells me that most people would consider \\"M386\\" the best song here.  I can see why- it's immediately melodic and contains a creepy vibe overall (not to mention would probably fit in perfectly with Another Green World) however it's a bit too repetitive and predictable for me to give it the highlight treatment.       Overall, you MUST listen to Another Green World first to hear Brian Eno's best example of melodic ambience, but please, make Music for Films your next choice.  You won't regret it.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Yes' seventh studio album Relayer was released in December of 1974.<br />By the summer of 1974, Yes had to deal with some discontentment in the ranks as keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman left the band due to the musical direction the band went on with Tales From Topographic Oceans. At that point, the remaining members of Yes (which comprised of singer/songwriter Jon Anderson, bass player Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe and drummer Alan White) hired Swiss keyboard maestro Patrick Moraz (who would join The Moody Blues in late 1978) to record an album that was seen as Son Of Close To The Edge (ironically ex-drummer Bill Bruford left Yes feeling that they would wind up recording Son of Close To the Edge and wasn't his cup of tea) but this was Yes veering into almost jazz-rock territory with great results as I found out in the Spring of 1997 when I bought the 1994 remastered CD.<br />We kick off with the side-long 22 minute epic called \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\". This was lyrically based on Tolstoy's War and Peace. The first eight minutes sees the pre-war gathering and tells of the soldiers going off to war and features stellar musicianship from the band. Then all of a sudden at over 8 minutes is \\"the war sequence\\" begins and was something that was mapped out in Anderson's head before the song was fleshed out and recorded by the band. This part featured screaming synths from Moraz, manic guitar solos from Howe. Plus the rhythm section of Squire and White going off. The sound effects being banged in the war section was White, Squire and Anderson beating on salvaged auto parts snagged from a junkyard. Then the final battle between synth and then Howe's screaming steel guitar. After the smoke is cleared comes the achingly beautiful \\"Soon\\" section to end the piece (which always brings a tear to my eye when I hear it). The piece ends with optimism and hope and the music is beautiful and fades away.<br />The second half of the album starts with the nearly 10 minute \\"Sound Chaser\\" which is a stellar jazz-fusion number that gave  King Crimson, Weather Report and Mahavishu Orchestra a run for their money with some wild lyrics and music playing but an excellent piece (even Alan White said this is one of his favorite Yes pieces). The middle section of this epic features an extended Howe guitar solo accompanied by Moraz's String Synthesizers and laid-back verse from Anderson before going into the wild outro with steel guitar, wild chanting and a synthesizer solo from Moraz. We close this excellent album with another lengthy piece out of \\"To Be Over\\" which is almost country-esque in sound (in thanks no part to Howe's steel guitar) and as laid back as Yes got with their music up to that point.<br />Relayer would reach #5 in the US in 1975 and (like the albums before this) went Gold upon its release.<br />A remastered version was released in 1994 but in 2003 another remaster was released, this time with bonus tracks out of the single edits of \\"Soon\\" and \\"Sound Chaser\\" plus an early take of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" so you would hear how this epic was fleshed out.<br />RECOMMENDED!hich is a stellar jazz-fusion number that gave  King Crimson, Weather Report and Mahavishu Orchestra a run for their money with some wild lyrics and music playing but an excellent piece (even Alan White said this is one of his favorite Yes pieces).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The concept of this book caught my attention from the get-go. A brutal, barbaic future where the government pits children against eachother to slaughter. A heart-wrenching spectacle where it is kill or be killed.<br /><br />I was drawn in by the characters and the dilemma they faced, ultimatley they would have to kill their friends or be killed themselves. The conclusion in the arena left me unable to put the book down and resulted in buying the last two because I just had to know how things were going to turn out.<br /><br />Loved this book!

0767836324|5.0|Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is your typical American lawyer with a beautiful wife (Caroline Goodall) and two kids ( Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott) as he's very busy with his job and all as they head out for a Christmas vacation to see his wife's grandma Wendy (Maggie Smith), while on their visit the kids are kidnapped by the insidious Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) who has taken them back to Neverland. Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) has returned to bring Peter to Neverland as it turns out the man happens to be an adult Peter Pan who never came back since he was 12 as he must reunite with the lost boys and reclaim his youthful spirit plus flying powers in 3 days in order to save his children from the pirates.<br /><br />A highly underrated sequel to the legendary J.M. Barrie fairytale directed by Steven Spielberg and a very original sequel. What works is that it has it's creative own continuity to the legendary books as the film offers comedy, adventure and even the origin of Peter Pan which was never told before on film or literature. I saw this 2 times in theaters when i was 10 and loved it, i even had those Mcdonalds happy meal toys and a couple of action figures plus a t-shirt, it's always been a fave of mine for years and a must watch for fans of Spielberg, fantasy and the stories of Peter Pan especially Disney's version.<br /><br />This DVD offers a nice transfer on the picture and good sound quality with only 2 extras which is the trailer and biographies of the stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel even though I wasn't sure what it was actually about. Sounded like the running man for teens. A terrible movie with a similar idea. Here, it has been executed in a much more enjoyable way. I enjoyed the Underland Chronicles from Collins before...Hunger Games is just as good or better. Highly recommended for teens to adults
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I will eschew the recap of the story (hundreds of other reviews can do that for you) in order to give you my review from a more literary perspective.  Don't get me wrong based on the title of my review: The Hunger Games is a very entertaining read, I barely put it down, and I immediately purchased Catching Fire.<br /><br />However, with every page I turned, I couldn't help but think of and compare this book to other books or stories, especially Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery,\\" Orwell's 1984 and the Richard Bachmann/Stephen King stories, \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"The Running Man\\" (the original story, not the movie adaptation).<br /><br />Like 1984, there's a dystopian setting pitting the proletariat classes of the 12 districts against the totalitarian elite of the Capitol.<br /><br />Like \\"The Lottery,\\" the Hunger Games tributes are selected at random as a sort of societal penance.<br /><br />Like the \\"Long Walk\\" you get to know the contestants (even the unlikable ones) a little bit, build a relationship of sorts with them as they undergo their grueling trials, even as you know that it can't end well.<br /><br />And perhaps the most fitting comparison is to \\"The Running Man\\" where the protagonist is pitted against hunters and the elements in a fight for survival where the prize for the last one standing is a lifetime of ease and comfort.<br /><br />There's even a little bit of Fahrenheit 451 - a glimmer of hope for the triumph of the indomitable human spirit over brutal fascism.  If I thought about it some more, there are probably other elements cribbed from other novels and authors - though no specific example comes to mind, the whole book reminded me hauntingly of the stories of Philip K. Dick.  Lord of the Flies also leaps to mind.<br /><br />Obviously, if you've never read any of these stories, you're not aware of how The Hunger Games borrows from these themes.  That's not to say that Suzanne Collins has plagiarized any of these works - after all, truly original themes are small in number, and even the greatest works of classical literature have leaned on themes that had been explored by others before them.  In this case, it's a lot like music - sometimes in the process of making an original tune, you arrange some notes in the same order that someone else has in the past.  It's not intentionally copying (you may not even have heard the other song before to know that they sound alike), but as you listen to the song you've created, there are little pieces where you subconsciously catch pieces of other things you sort of recognize but maybe can't quite place.<br /><br />The book was very enjoyable, written in a straightforward first-person prose that reflects the character and setting - simple but not childish, and also without the kind of pretentiousness that you might expect from this kind of protagonist in other novels.  The story is told with a voice that you easily equate with the character.  If I had one complaint, I think the setup for the actual Hunger Games, including the selection and training of the tributes, dragged on a bit too long so that the Game itself seemed very compressed and rushed by comparison.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the Hunger Games Trilogy bundle for Kindle is a more cost-effective option, saving you a few dollars compared to buying all three volumes of the series one at a time.  If I had realized that going in, I probably would have bought the Trilogy - I just saw a few different recommendations for the book recently and was looking for something new to read and picked it up to give it a try.assical literature have leaned on themes that had been explored by others before them.

0316069906|2.0|Eating animals was exactly what I expected from Foer in terms of the reality of factory farming, but what surprised me was his insistence on perpetuating a black and white stance concerning vegetarianism. The last two chapters of the book promoted the idea that vegetarianism is a more holistic and environmentally sound lifestyle over the herd mentally that comprises those who support factory farms. He promotes PETA and Omnivores Dilemma quite a bit, but remaining obviously stubborn in his views, conveys a sense of distrust to the reader. Disregarding of animal life has it's faults, but similar arguments can be made concerning conventional horticultural practices. Foer's argument is weak, and unless you have no understanding of the horrors of current practices, don't bother reading it. I will honestly say that it one of the most biased books I have read in a while.

The story of Susie Salmon, told from her after death it amazing.  How she sees everyone on Earth go about their lives after her death, and the search for her killer is such an original idea.  This book grabbed me from the first page after the original cover catching my eye at the bookstore.  This, although so very sad, was such an amazing story and such a pleasure to read.  I am not able to reread books very often, but this one was easy to!  Thank you Alice Sebold for giving Susie and her story to the world!
B002N1AERI|5.0|I realize that most of the people who are going to buy this cd already have, but I just wanted to post this in case it might help some one avoid the situation I am in now. A year or so back this album was very expensive, but cheap as an MP3, so I bought it that way. I was buying Kamelot's Black Halo at the same time and figured I'd be able to understand most of the words sung by these great singers without needing to have the lyrics in front of me. Well, Simone is probably the easiest woman on Earth to listen to, but I can't understand the growled parts by the male singer, so I'm wishing I had bought the actual cd of Design Your Universe with the lyric book, etc. Its a great album, a really excellent blend of sexy singing and good heavy metal with orchestral elements thrown in. The whole enchilada, in other words, and deserving of a spot on my cd rack. So good I may actually buy it twice, which I can't remember doing for any other album before, besides when I am upgrading to a remastered version of my old stuff.
0316098329|5.0|This book was such a quick read!  The author did a wonderful job of telling the story from the child's point of view!  Then, as an adult, the reader can think of it as an adult would.  This made it more interesting for me.  \\"Ma\\" did an amazing job raising her son under those conditions, and it just makes you realize what humans can really handle.  It puts perspective on a life so full of technology and children/adults used to getting whatever they want over what they need. It makes you enjoy and appreciate your children even more.  I loved Jack and the way the author told his story!  I plan on looking into more of the author's work!

B003YL4L0W|4.0|I can always count on Jodi Picoult to gather me up by the heart strings, pull and prod and jangle my emotions a bit while reading her work, and this book was no exception. I gravitate towards her books because I know that they will be well-written, and she assumes that her readers are intelligent enough to fill in the blanks. I found that in this book, Sing You Home, in particular she has created flawed characters with sins and narrow-minded views of the world, yet she does not condemn or condone their actions. Rather she just weaves a brilliant, multi-faceted story and lets the reader see the humans behind the imperfections.<br /><br />Sing You Home has a bit of everything (infertility- a theme near to my own heart) failed relationships, unexpected attractions, religious bigotry, medical debates- and yet the story never feels one-sided, tired or played out. It takes a certain amount of finesse to pull that off in these times. Since I received the hard copy for review, I will certainly hand this off so someone else can enjoy it as much as I did. That is, if I can find a friend who hasn't made the ebook leap!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Been looking for this DVD for my daughter for a while. It was shipped fast and arrived just as promised - in the original packaging -- unopened. Excellent transaction! The DVD itself seems a little like the color is not as sharp as I remember, but maybe I'm just used to watching the modern Disney classics since technology has improved the color.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|First of all I would rate this movie 8/10.    Rise of the Planet of the Apes highly recommended to watch.    The special effects, action, script is stunning.     This movie has the same good quality as the Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes sequel.    I would rate this movie one of the most anticipated ones of the year.    I am waiting for the special edition DVD release to purchase.

0765324849|5.0|I was skeptical on finding out there was a book written as a prequel to the story of the BioShock video games, but I have always been intrigued with the story of the undersea city of Rapture so I went ahead and bought it. I am currently half way through reading it and VERY happy with the storyline! They explain so many characters and details from the vg! Even some questions I didn't realize were there were answered like why Frank Fontaine is the way he is. I am also happy with how thick the book is, it's not a big lettered short book, but a nice length to really give detail to the story. Definitely a must-read to any fan of the series.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I love Hunger Games and keep looking for something along those lines, both in storyline, quality and depth of characters.  This is as close as you are going to get!  Great story.
B004G600A4|5.0|Wonderful songs, enjoyable for girls and boys as well ( the \\"hero\\" is admirable). FYI... My masculine husband really enjoyed it as well.      We first saw this movie in theaters in 3D and I couldn't quit saying \\"WOW!!\\" during and after.  We even went back several times.  The scenery is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen....and I mean EVERY scene of the movie is gorgeous!  The story is clever and includes intelligent dialogue that is smart and quite funny.  Of course we bought the DVD the first day it was released.  We do not have a 3D TV yet, but this movie makes me really WANT a 3D TV even more.  Don't worry... It is beautiful in 2D as well.  The lantern scene is breathtaking and magical.... One of the songs was nominated for an Academy Award ( and should have won!).    We also have the soundtrack.  Mandy Moore is Rapunzel's beautiful yet down-to-earth voice, and I cannot say enough about the performance she gives as Rapunzel.  (If your daughter likes to sing, you will NEED this soundtrack, as it is never boring to hear over and over again.)    The one very slight issue parents might need to know is that Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and raised by a kidnapper she thinks is her mother.  This kidnapper mom is devious and wants to keep Rapunzel in the tower (to be with Rapunzel's \\"magic hair\\") by always telling her how dangerous and scary it is in the world.  In the beginning of the movie, the kidnapper mom seems to care about Rapunzel, but then she keeps you guessing.  She also sings a funny song called \\"Mother Knows Best\\", which required some breif explaining to my eight yr old daughter that REAL mom's DO know what's best, but that the kidnapper mom is NOT Rapunzel's real mom.  This idea puts a slight quandry to us real mom's, but of course everything works out in the end.  Mom's will definitely relate to Rapunzel's desire, at age 18, to explore the world and make decisions on her own as she become a young lady.    Regardless, I HIGHLY recommend this movie... One of the best to come from Disney.  If you didn't see it in the theaters in 3D... You need to RUN get a 3D TV so that you can also sit in awe while your kids laugh and sing along with Rapunzel and Flynn.

1401223176|5.0|A complex and dynamic story arc for the Dark Knight as he juggles with the schemes of some of his greatest villains, and allies, all within one of Batman's greatest adventures.<br /><br />The mystery is captivating and the artwork by Jim Lee is by far the best I've ever seen in any comic or graphic novel. Batman has never looked better and I found myself frequently marveling at the fascinating images and action set-pieces within the pages.<br /><br />Hush is on the same level as The Dark Knight Returns, in scope and ambition, and it delivers as one of Batman's best tales.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|and that is why I have not rated a Feast For Crows.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons is considerably better than A Feast For Crows ONLY because the characters on which POV's are based are considerably more interesting ones.<br /><br />Beyond that, nothing much happens. People who are hooked to this story ( and regrettably so, because at the current pace I will be retired - or worse - when the thing reaches a conclusion ) are left clueless as to what it is all about. It feels allmost as if George R R Martin himself is lost within the vastness of the \\"monster\\" he created.<br /><br />Of one thing I am sure: The \\"addictive \\" effect of the first 3 books is gone. I am no longer hooked and eagerly waiting for the next installment.
B0013527I4|5.0|I purchased this for my son and he absolutely loved it. There are some shows that are repeats of another season, but it well worth it if you are a 'muppet freak' or a collector.

0307463745|4.0|Rework is a book about how to rethink business-how to rethink your job, how to rethink your colleagues, how to rethink success. So what's wrong with business in the first place?<br /><br />Well, like how many pursuits go awry in life, the emphasis of image over substance (like in Mastery) is the killer. So how does this come across in business? The desire to have a cool business card is one way, the desire to get big fast is another, the desire to use `bizspeak' words when plain English will do is another. There is this temptation to very quickly overcome your small size and limited experience, with a veneer of cheesy tacked on `professionalism,' which really stinks because, of course, everyone around you can smell it. It's a turn-off. And if you're being dishonest about your size, your success and your persona, is it possible you're being dishonest about your products too? Of course.<br /><br />And so this book is actually an antidote for that reckless egotism: rather than emphasize methods to grow big, strong, rich and famous fast (see 99% of Business Books next time your at the Airport), it pursues great products, and emphasizes the varied advantages of actually being small, nimble, and unknown. Instead of fighting against yourself, or chasing a ghost called \\"credibility\\", you use your newness and small size to your advantage. Furthermore, by adopting this `alternate' route to success, your customers, suppliers, partners and fans, can fall in love with the real you, instead of that guy from Wall Street (or worse, American Psycho).<br /><br />There is a great expression, often used in the tech industry: Eating your own dogfood. If you eat your own dogfood, it means you actually use the products your company makes-all the time. There is a fundamental difference here between great companies, and good profitable businesses: some of the best companies in the world were started just because the founders wanted to buy their own product but couldn't find it on the market. Nike started this way, as did Apple, as did 37signals. What's the advantage here? The advantage is a keen awareness (sometimes neurotic is a better word here) and insane obsession with perfectionism. Steve Jobs has famously barked at his designers because the original iPod took too many clicks to get the music to come on. He's not tapped in to what the consumers want, and famously abhors focus groups. What Jobs wants isn't an awesome music player/phone/laptop for you, but for himself.<br /><br />Why doesn't every company do this? Because frankly some companies are just set up to make money. There's a hole in the market,there's an arbitrage opportunity, and there's money to be made. But you don't get fans for being interested in arbitrage. And without fans, you don't get the free advertising. You don't get recommendations. And you sure don't get people carving your company logo into the back of their head.<br /><br />More reviews like this at 21tigeras did Apple, as did 37signals. What's the advantage here?

I would say for me the diet is too boring to be useful long term. Biggest point here is that do not eat FAT and do not eat BREAD if you want to lose seriosu weight. Agreed!

0553801473|3.0|George:<br /><br />I am sixty three years of age.  Please do not make me wait another six years for your next book, in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  I am getting a bit too long in the tooth for such a wait.  And a bit of a disappointing wait this one was.<br /><br />Even though \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" had its moments, it became a tedious read.  There were two few \\"Oh my God\\" moments, that I experienced in the first four books of the series.  After splitting the last two books, I thought you would close a lot of the plot and character gaps in ADWD.  That did not happen.  You have added characters, which was fine, but you left out the tales of Brienne, Sansa and Samwell.  There wasn't enough concerning Jamie, Davos, and Bran. You slowed the journey of Tyrion and Victarion to a crawl. And don't you think Daenerys needs to go home.<br /><br />I hope your next book will begin to close the gaps and begin to bring this wonderful epic tale to a conclusion.  Please stop wandering.  Winter is coming!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|\\"The ArchAndroid\\" is essentially a conglomeration of genres (folk, soul, disco, pop, jazz, etc) laced with a sci-fi theme detailing the story of an android named Cindi Mayweather. In a sequel to \\"Metropolis\\" (the first Suite), Cindi fulfills her destiny on the planet Metropolis set in the year 3005 (according to lyrics from \\"Locked Inside\\"), a throwback to Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" days. Apparently, the character is meant to be an archetypal medium between the minority and the majority 'uniting the mind and the hand'. In a lovely twist of irony our heroine Cindi Mayweather, the android, becomes the proverbial 'heart' of the piece. If even after a few listens you can't decipher the exact story line then don't worry about it, once you know the general story arch just sit back and enjoy. I have a feeling the artist's intention was to be a bit ambiguous anyway.<br /><br />This effort comes across more as a cinematic soundtrack or even a Broadway musical score than a pop album, which is a good thing. If you like variety when it comes to mood/subject matter then \\"The ArchAndroid\\" is definitely for you. I heard everything from folk to psychedelic rock which, for listeners unfamiliar with artistic/musical outliers, might disturb the casual listener.<br /><br />Personally, I found very little to dislike here with a few of my favorites being \\"Sir Greendown\\", a song about our cyborg heroine falling in love with a human aka Anthony Greendown; very whimsical and adds a 'fairytale' element to Monae's futuristic chronicle. \\"57821\\" is a folksy ballad reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkle's 'Scarborough Fair'. \\"Oh, Maker\\" is Cindy's letter to God reflecting on the wonders of love and the pain of heartbreak: \\"Oh maker have you ever loved/or known just what it was/I can't imagine the bitter end/of all the beauty that we're living in\\". \\"Tightrope\\" is the Outkast influenced radio friendly track featuring the Big Boi himself, Antwan Patton; a funky uptempo grove with one of the best beats I've heard in a while. \\"BaBopByeYa\\" is the album's finale and what a finale; Monae's vocals soar over a somber jazz arrangement in three movements pining for...well...I don't want to give away the ending, of course. Additionally, the instrumentals are thankful respites from the heart-wrenching (though not unpleasant) drama and seem to create balance in keeping with traditional orchestral compositions. Poetic lyrics coupled with intelligent arrangements (eg: heavy breathing laced throughout \\"Come Alive\\" really makes you feel as though she's 'coming alive') create a harmonious balance between contemporary and archaic styles.<br /><br />I honestly can not stop listening to this album it is such a breath of fresh air! I have been waiting for something like this to come along for a while now and Janelle Monae has outdone herself and should be very proud. The breadth and depth of creativity inherent within \\"The ArchAndroid\\" is virtually untouchable, especially when considering the air-headed fare produced by Morae's contemporaries. And while the Grammys snub was a bit dissapointing, her performance of \\"Cold War\\" encapsulated the  spirit and energy epitomized by this masterful work of art. I encourage you to check out any of her live performances on YouTube and/or pick up this gem. I guarantee you will be in for a treat!d in a while. \\"BaBopByeYa\\" is the album's finale and what a finale; Monae's vocals soar over a somber jazz arrangement in three movements pining for...well...I don't want to give away the ending, of course.

B000002UYZ|1.0|This and the \\"blue\\" album are responsible for my introduction to the Beatles when I was in the 3rd grade. This was probably more appealing to me at the time, and for that I am grateful, but I still petulantly grant this one star.     First, it perpetuates the idea that there was a clear break between the early and late Beatles in 1966. Second, it gets the songs so wrong, e.g., omitting Tomorrow Never Knows and Taxman, let alone No Reply, while including Yellow Submarine, the comic relief from the lads' best album.     When I tell people that We Can Work it Out is my favorite favorite of Beatles song, they often look at me like I'm a child. Why, isn't that pretty much like Love Me Do? I blame this album for the fact that the peak Beatles (65-66) are often dismissed as simplistic and inferior to their later work. Nonsense.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|I caught onto trivium midway through their current musical life and I always admired them for their old school metal feel.  In Waves does not dissapoint and I think its their best album, I don't skip over a song and the flow is amazing.  Ember and Ascendency together are almost a different band than crusade on, and I can't stand when people harp on bands past performances from 10 years ago, move on already.  Crusade had the right idea, but just lacked energy where as shogun had bright spots but over compensated for crusade with overly complex riffs which ended up in tracks with messy structure and forcing in predictable screaming.  I feel like they made shogun in response to criticism where as In Waves is just F the world, here's Trivium.  In Waves puts together the best of both with just a straight up rockin album.  You don't have to make some super creative album to be awesome, just gotta kick some b@lls in.  Not sure why they get so much criticism all the time, Trivium is one of the best \\"newer\\" bands out there and as long as they just stick being themselves and ignoring the d0uches who still think every album should sound like ember to the inferno or its terrible, grow up, In Waves rocks and is a must buy.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Sorry...but Jane Eyre was an intelligent and very opinionated girl full of energy and passion.  This girl had very little personality at all,  not enough for a master to take notice of a servant.  Not even close.  I blame the director.  He seems to have taken more interest in Rochester's character while leaving poor Jane wondering around like someone had slipped a sedative in her drink.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Can I get an amen?  Wow!<br /><br /> I really loved the first three movies in this franchise.  Even though they recycled the same plot with different actors and kills scenarios, I always found them to be very fun.  The fourth, however, really dropped the ball.  I may have enjoyed a few scenes, but there was a noticeable drop in quality and I was left bitterly distrustful of the series.  That said, I had high hopes for this fifth installment which was directed by new blood director Steven Quale, who has never been at the helm of a movie, but assisted Cameron on Avatar.  I purchased my ticket willingly and with optimism.<br /><br /> Not only did this movie make up for the Shakespearian tragedy of its immediate predecessor, but I enjoyed completely unexpected levels of quality.  For one thing, they got some funny actors (David Koechner of Anchorman, Waiting; P. J. Byrne of  BET's The Game, Horrible Bosses) who delivered a degree of inter-kill-scene comedy which the other movies lacked.  This comedy did not make the exciting anticipation of the next kill any less intense.  In fact, these deaths mixed gasp-inducing red herrings, \\"oh my God\\" shocking moments, and comedic 80's-esque execution with excellent CGI effects.<br /><br /> P. J. Byrne really stole the show.  To look at him, he's clearly no womanizer.  But the things he says to woman after woman over the phone remind us of our self-absorbed frat buddies who couldn't be more rude to the opposite sex.  Then there's Koechner, whose lines are as great as his death scene in the opening act.<br /><br /> Here's an out-of-left-fielder.  I actually enjoyed the 3D.  This is the first time EVER that I have seen a movie in 3D without disfavoring it to the standard 2D.  My Bloody Valentine was carefully made for 3D enjoyment, but it really seemed second to this.  The writing, CGI, kill creativity, tactful cast, humor and production value made for a grippingly funny and overall well-made horror flick.  For its high-budget-B-horror genre, the greatness of this movie was almost unwarranted.  It reminded me of another movie which truly shocked me with overall quality: Jennifer's Body.  Both movies may have been deliberately campy, but both also had the actors, writers, direction and effects reserved for films of much greater magnitude and far displaced from the realm of modern horror.  Also, the ending, following suit with the rest of the movie, was delivered with a twist so clever that I'll bet no one sees it coming!<br /><br /> If you love horror see this movie.movie was almost unwarranted.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|I started this series as a way to get my daughter to read and I was challenging her; who could finish first. At first I though that it was a little to Harlequin romance for me  but as I read on the series kept getting better and better and will say the final book of the series is a complete joy to read. I loved the way she set the book up from different prospective. I would totally rate this a must read series but trust me it is slow and gets great. This is a great series to get your kids reading, my daughter absolutely loved it and in the process I have bought her own kindle and she is in love with reading now.
0553801473|1.0|This book deserves no more than a 2.5 to 3 star review at best. So. With that in mind, I have added a 1 star review to help counter all the bull@#%$ five star reviewers on Amazon who are trying so desperately to save ADWD from being seen for what it is:Drek. George Martin is doubtless a creative genius, but this book is the equivalent of what a genius might dump in a toilet after taking a turbo laxative, one that just keeps the @$#% coming indefinitely, 1000 pages of it to be exact. And you too can have the it, for just $18.95.<br /><br />Anyway, I have only one question: How can a veritable genius of modern fantasy, with no less than 3 masterpieces to his credit, take 6 years to write this 1000-page dung book when we know he has written 3 brilliant books in just 5?<br /><br />What happened?

I finally checked them out and I've got to say they are really good. You've got the awesome rocking jams like \\"Rollin\\", \\"Hot Dog\\" and \\"My Way\\", and the cool mysterious tracks like \\"Take a Look Around\\" and \\"Boiler\\", and the melancholy-ish awesome song \\"The One\\". So all-in-all it contains a good mix of songs for the awesome nu-metal sensation, with bits of rap/hiphop beats and rhymes. Great metal album.

B0052U59F4|4.0|Yes, I read the fan fiction version and was happy to buy the \\"revised\\" story. The author came up with an original, compelling plot and should get something out of all her hard work.     I love romances, but they have gotten SO formula (Lisa Kleypas)! I've been bored to tears lately and looking for something different. This was just the ticket. And even though I know what happens, revisiting this story had me sneaking off to read every chance I got! Nice. For a story that is primarily about the interaction between two people - not an intricate, complicated plot - it held my attention. And it wasn't just because of the sexual tension (well, ok, that was a big part of it...)    I did notice the errors... Yes, I was a bit surprised that this next step was taken without employing a professional editor. And I did laugh at some of the names. I mean, Anastasia is just so... I kept stumbling over it. I thought may-be I was just out of the name loop so I googled it. It may be popular in other countries, but it ranks about 365th in the United States.     But I still enjoyed the story, till I got to the \\"end.\\" I expected that this VERY long story would have to be edited down and broken up, may-be into two parts... but I was shocked to find the decision was made to end it where she did. Awkward! If I hadn't already read the whole story, I would have walked away in disgust, because I hate stories that string me along and end badly. It was a BAD ending. Right now I'm irritated enough to think, I've made my contribution to the budding author and it's too pricey for a trilogy. Of course, if you haven't read the story before, you should know that this is NOT the end, and you'll want to read more...

Up until the time I received the complete edition, all the Holmes stories I had read were in paperback versions or from the library. This book is a treasure: it allows me to read and re-read any Holmes story I want to read, in any order, without having to resort to another source somewhere. I particularly like that the novels/novellas are included, and that the collections are printed in the order they appeared to the public more than 120 years ago. A treasure to own, an even greater treasure to enjoy.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I was thinking about giving it 4 stars, but somehow did not feel like it--mostly because it missed few opportunities to be profound. The acting was good, and despite slapstick comedies and graphic, raw violence, the movie was successful enough to show brutality, absurdity, and paradox of war, where in reality nobody is actually a victor. what I find most praiseworthy how the producer was able to shift between comedy/tragedy and action.  You don't have to watch it though. Enjoyable? Yes. Highly recommend? Probably not.:-)
0446401307|4.0|I enjoy all Harry Bosch novels, but some more so than others. For me this was a 3.5 star book, a story that didn't seem fully developed and seemed a bit different from the other novels, perhaps only because of its plot and/or its length. I wouldn't call this disappointing, though: just less than I expected. Bosch is such a fully developed character that I think he can't disappoint.
0062060554|5.0|Can you imagine a life where you wake up every day and can't remember anything?  That is the story of Christine, who has suffered memory loss from an accident.  Every morning, she awakens next to the man she doesn't remember marrying, in a house she doesn't know, and has to be told who she is all over again.  She keeps a journal, but that only helps if someone tells her where it is.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful and the character development makes you care about Christine and her journey.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel.  There are twists and turns that you don't expect at all and the ending will shock you.  I had not heard of this author before, but I certainly hope that he is busily working on some new material for us.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is very well done and I know we will watch it many times. The acting and the story are realistic. If you are looking for entertainment with a good story line then this is the film for you.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|The historical accuracy and sheer intensity of \\"The Conspirator\\" make it a film well worth investing in. The abundance of research put into the story is obvious throughout the film and because of this, \\"The Conspirator\\" stands out among other comparable films. If this is a preview of what The American Film Company will bring in the future, we have a lot to look forward to .
B004LWZW42|5.0|Growing up, I loved reading \\"X-Men\\" comics, and found compelling the themes of difference and alienation.  Magneto was an ambivalent villain, and good and evil was not so clear-cut in the \\"X-Men\\" series as they were in other comics.  I had major problems with Hollywood's \\"X-Men\\" trilogy, as it sacrificed a lot of the intellectual themes that made \\"X-Men\\" so interesting for a lot of bangs and booms.      \\"X-Men:  First Class,\\" the trilogy prequel as well as the franchise reboot, brings back a lot of what was intellectually interesting about the comic book series.  Charles Xavier is as glib as always, but there's a lot of thought and detail that went into the development of the Magneto character, a character who came into being when Sebastian Shaw killed his mother.  (In a way, Sebastian fathered Magneto by killing his mother.)      It's always reassuring to know that talented directors can make movies that are fun to watch as well as interesting to think about.  There's a lot of food for thought in this movie, and hopefully the dark themes first introduced in this movie can be continued in the sequel.
0307269752|1.0|Awful. Totally uninteresting. They could have cut about 300 pages out of this book, there was that much useless information in it, and it still would have been uninteresting. I honestly think the author was expecting readers to be surprised by Salander being a hacker (the explanation for how she came about so much information on people. I figured it out after she was introduced, thanks). There were paragraphs and paragraphs devoted to people drinking coffee and eating sandwiches.<br /><br />None of the characters are very interesting. We're expected to believe that the main character, Blomkvist, is this extraordinary ladies man, and every time he meets a woman she instantly wants to sleep with him. Was this really necessary? Not at all. And again, we're somehow supposed to be impressed that this girl, Salander, is a hacker. She does nothing deductive, just steal things off of people's personal computers. Thats it. Also, I find it pretty difficult to believe that any court would make her a ward of the state. She didn't really seem that troubled in the grand scheme of things, she just seems like a jerk most of the time.<br /><br />All in all, this was just a bad book. Don't bother.

076790592X|2.0|So many people have loved this book, but I'm gonna have to be a party pooper here. No, I am not a conservative or a capitalist or a Republican, or even an anarchist, but I was fully aware of the liberal/leftist ideology that permeates the entire book. That the book deals with the final weekly meetings between author Mitch Albom and his dying mentor/professor Morrie Schwartz (Brandeis U) has already been covered in detail in other reviews, so I'll just comment on the perceived value of chronicling these meetings in a book. I bought and read this book because it promised to relate to the readers the lifelong wisdom of a dying man, but I was sorely disappointed. His central revelation is that love is the most important thing in life. We must forgive. We must not let the capitalist system mislead us. We must be fair to all. We are all equal. People are inherently good but society and capitalism makes them bad. We are all one family. Impending death teaches us how to live. Be compassionate. Respect should be part of love. Relationships are important. Now that I know I am dying...\\"do I wither up and disappear, or do I make the best of my time left?\\" And etc, etc. I am sorry, but there's nothing there I haven't heard before as part of the liberal/leftist/progressive ideology. Even if I were to consider only the process of the author meeting with his dying professor every week for very personal conversations, I would still say I did not find much to enlighten me since these meetings revealed simply how Morrie makes the best of it by seeing a multitude of friends and family and optimistically encouraging them to live life to the fullest (of course, within the liberal/leftist view of life). So, if you are a liberal/leftist you probably will find this book a validation of principles dear to your heart. But, if you believe as I do that there are many ways of dealing with life and death besides this one, then you will come to realize that perhaps our political and moral ideologynot only can guide us in life but can dictate how we see our impending death as well. In today's world of polarized ideas, politics, religions, morals, and ideologies, it is hard to envision that there is a universal lesson to be learned from any dying man, in spite of what this book promises to deliver. As wonderful and loving as Professor Morrie is deemed to have been, his deathbed wisdom is inseparable from his political ideology, a fact we need to consider when we search for universal truths in those with exemplary lives.

B004VUP8WK|5.0|In the taxonomy of extreme metal, there is nary a shadowy crawlspace for subjectivity. No one has a seizure when they look at best-of lists and see \\"Altars of Madness\\".  The rough parameters of the style were established crusty eons ago by people that played the music that they would want to listen to, and by accident, what fans wanted to hear.  The great bands, old and new, rise like flame to the heavens and are recognized.  If this comes off as a bit fascistic, I agree that your soul is free to live in whatever illusion it desires.  But there is no freedom without truth-- and the truth is that this album is jaw-dropping, use once and destroy awesome.<br /><br />*Too Extreme is an ecstatic shock to the senses.  It brings to mind hard-hitting electro-house and London bass as much as hardcore techno. By the ears of an old-school raver, new school desert burner, this is manifestly state-of-the-art. (For a link between Burning Man and heavy metal, consider the lyrics of \\"Flame to the Surface\\" by Cryptopsy).<br /><br />*I Am Morbid is the premier rallying cry for death metal unity.  In a parallel dimension anyway, where the listeners are highly sophisticated.  It could also be a reply to the title of Tom G. Warrior's book about Celtic Frost.<br /><br />*Destructos Vs. The Earth is the only true answer to Iron Man ever made.  If you want something to stick in your craw, listen to the version of Iron Man on Nativity in Black II.<br /><br />*Nevermore has sounds (guitar?!) that reminded me of golden age techstep drum & bass.  Azagthoth is the Tom Morello of death metal.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that some have failed to find enjoyment in this album.  If this album did not sit well with you, perhaps it will be some consolation to know that there are serious metalheads who worship material like this, which only a band of Morbid's caliber can deliver.  It might suggest a departure from the usual chemical formulas (those spelled out in \\"Goddamn Electric\\" by Pantera).  But the exquisite panache that this album radiates is the result of musical genius married to decades of performance.<br /><br />Let's consider the matter of lyrics.  Traditional death metal lyrics are a reductionist study of the human body and its frailties, or alternatively, metaphysical speculation as to the limitless power of the mind.  Vincent takes the latter path most often, channeling the voice of a vainglorious, deranged deity calling his faithful to celebrate.  His magniloquence is unmatched in the scene; he is a hero, a leader, he chants in Latin for gods' sake.  Here, the brilliant camp and irony in Vincent's lyrics is executed with Tarantino -levels of style and confidence.  It brings to mind the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs or the Conan of Robert E. Howard.  While we are on the subject, have you ever read the lyrics to Beneath the Remains-- or The Negation, cherished treasures that they are?  The, ahem, outsider's take on our language is part of the charm, not to mention an alien challenge to our conceptual scheme. (Incidentally, the newest Decapitated has some of the best lyrics ever to grace a metal album, penned by Jarek Szubrycht).<br /><br />I'm going to be honest with you-- outside of interludes, 95% of the time I have a serious problem with electronics-- even keyboards-- being used in extreme metal.  Aside from a few tracks on Remanufacture, it just has never sounded right.  That is all changing now.  I'm not sure if it is a result of advances in studio technology or the heightened sophistication of the artists, but for empirical proof of the evolution, you need only hear the terrifying sub-bass of Bring Me The Horizon's dubstep remixes, the shocking studio manipulations on the new Whitechapel, or the minimalist, industrial keyboards of Daath.  Or this album-- though be aware that Tim Yeung provides most of the drum hits.<br /><br />Finally, I would be remiss if I did not point out that your ears will not be murdered by faux-opera singing on this.<br /><br />After I had drafted up this review,  I saw that Metal Hammer had reviewed this and gave it 9/10 stars.  I was relieved, but at the same time felt a little less special.  Guard against that feeling.  If everyone in the world loved metal, would you hate it?  That would be a sad comment on existence, but such abstract questions need not trouble us.  This is a marginalized art form that should be hailed with as much fanfare as classical music was in ages past, with its patrons kings and queens.t Metal Hammer had reviewed this and gave it 9/10 stars.

B0012GN47C|4.0|As I have indicated in other reviews, Santana has demonstrated a propensity to release music as album styles, in groups of three.  For instance the first three Santana albums were of the classic \\"Santana Rock\\" period, the three formed a triumvirate of new powerful rock music that dominated the charts.  The music on all three albums progressed easily from a fantastic debut to an incredible pinnacle of performance, but the core style of music on the three held them together as a package.  The next three Santana albums were the \\"new\\" Santana, spiritual and fusion jazz driven.  They did not have the commercial success of the first three, but in the jazz circles and from the pens of critics, the applause was mighty!  AMIGOS now begins another trio of albums (studio releases 7, 8, and 9 respectively) that some consider the \\"festival\\", or \\"carnival\\" (in the Latin sense of the word) trio.  These are happy albums, filled with fun and dance music.  Santana's interpretive improvisational styles are still key in these albums, and they draw heavily from both the core classic rock period of Santana, and from the most recent funk-fusion-jazz period.  AMIGOS marks another corner for Carlos and band to turn, a new street to play on.  AMIGOS charted in the top 10 on the charts (barely) which attests to the return to more commercial venues, so perhaps Bill Graham had something to do with pushing Carlos back from the jazz circles, but admittedly, AMIGOS and the follow-up FESTIVAL are a mixed bag (however a good mixed bag for solid Santana fans).<br /><br />AMIGOS attempted two singles, a truncated version of Dance Sister Dance which failed to crack the charts, and Let It Shine which barely cracked the charts, peaking at #77 for one week.  One would suspect that Santana had failed in the attempt to return to commercial success, but AMIGOS did grab album chart position #10 for a couple weeks, and there is no denying that the two best compositions on the album are stalwart standards of the Santana fan base as well as concert staples.  Dance Sister Dance is, despite the lack of chart success (the single version was seriously flawed), is a vision of both dance hall Santana feel-good music and during and after the transmutation (which marks the typical Santana compositions) an incredible guitar-keyboard-percussion trip.  Europa, upon first listen in 1976, was and is easily identifiable as a song which would come to mark the definition of just what Santana really is.  It is probably one of the most played concert songs, it has been in constant rotation on FM stations and has appeared on numerous \\"best of\\", live, and instrumental compilations, and is arguably one of, if not the, most popular Santana single (despite the fact that it was not released as a chart single).  Europa is a solemn and emotional guitar solo with ethereal keyboards, somewhat an evolutionary extension of Samba Pa Ti, it was first composed when Carlos witnessed a friend having a bad trip on mescaline.  Keyboardist Tom Coster assisted Carlos with some of the chord progressions and the song was born.  These two songs alone are worth the purchase of the CD at the budget price, especially considering the remastered sound quality, easily accomplished since the original masters for release of the album were of the highest caliber by 1976 standards.  Take Me With You, Let Me, and Guitano, are all more than mere acceptable entries to the Santana canon, they each bring (brought) a rather new slant on the Santana sound, including Spanish guitar, funky R&B and gospel oriented Latin rock.  The real losers on the album are two good attempts which just fall flat with most listeners:  the failed single Let It Shine (a Sly & Family Stone funk and gospel attempt with good intentions that you might tolerate or even like depending on your own ears), and the terrible preachy Tell Me Are You Tired of which I really have nothing good to say.  Both songs begin with promise but quickly fall into disarray.<br/><br />If you do not have Europa and/or if you do not have the 8 minute version of Dance Sister Dance, I would highly recommend this album with the confidence that you will enjoy at least half if not more of the album (who knows, you might love it all).  AMIGOS is a definitive sounding album in the Santana catalog, it is by no means, a poor album (for that, avoid Beyond Appearances and Freedom in '85 and '87 respectively).  There is however, an easy way to bypass both AMIGOS and the follow-up FESTIVAL and still keep the best elements of both, and that is to purchase the glorious double disc album release, MOONFLOWER which is easily one of the best Santana albums ever.  Check out my review there!  If you are a completist like me, and have been exchanging your vinyl for CD over the years or if you never bought this album and were wondering if the other tunes sitting with the Big 2 on this package were any good, I would say go for it.do not have Europa and/or if you do not have the 8 minute version of Dance Sister Dance, I would highly recommend this album with the confidence that you will enjoy at least half if not more of the album (who knows, you might love it all).

B004SMDJ9U|3.0|REVIEWER UPDATE 08/23/11<br />I did in fact, continue watching this season beyond the first seven or so episodes. I was just too close to the end to give up. While my original criticism still stands, I will say the episodes did get a bit better. After a flawed and incohesive start (where I was having to suspend my disbelief way too far for comfort), I found that I was a little more entertained than irriated by the end. We'll have to see if season 2 is an improvement or not.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />I picked up Haven, Season 1 because I was looking for something new to watch. The price was less than $20 (cant often beat that!) and the show concept seemed pretty interesting (weird goings on in a small Maine costal town). To top it off, the lead actress, Emily Rose, looked atractive in a wholesome kind of way and the reviews I had read were pretty positive as well. But.....after watching five episodes in the past few days, I don't know if I can watch any more!<br /><br />Let me preface the negative by saying that the set up for this show is outstanding. The scenery is uniquely beautiful. It would be a great place for a great story. And the premise of a show based around odd and unexplainable supernatural events could make for some great escapism. Add to that a hint of a larger story arc for the main character and this could be really great. Right?<br /><br />Wrong. The problem with this show is that the writing is formulaic, it is lazy, and it is insipid. And because the writing is so poor, the execution of the stories is downright laughable. I found the resolutions to the stories to be ridiculous and the character responses to the events in which they are involved to be even more ridiculous.  I will admit that the character themselves aren't bad (the problem is not the acting), but the characters don't react in a realistic manner (in dialogue and in their actions) to the supernatural happenings. Add to that the fact that I noticed numerous continuity issues for one scene to the next. And lastly, the special effects for the show are so amateurish that they too are laughable.<br /><br />This show would benefit from a reboot. Get some good writers and pretend that the first season never happened. Too many shows sell an idea or a concept, but can't deliver with the execution.

B000JQV68A|4.0|This is the first F. Scott Fitzgerald book I ever read and I felt like my reading experience was accentuated by recently having read a biography of Zelda Fitzgerald.  I know that Fitzgerald used Zelda's actual expressions and writings when creating his female characters and it was interesting to have the context to be able to see it.  It is absolutely chilling to know that Fitzgerald will drink himself to death while you're reading about a potentially talented young man who is drinking himself to death.<br /><br />The story is engaging and immediate.  There were multiple points where I stopped to admire the language or reread a passage.  When I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking about it.  I did feel that Fitzgerald showed an over-reliance on some words (\\"fatuous\\" appeared way too often) and at times I felt like stuff was just being thrown on the page indiscriminately.  I also wish that Fitzgerald hadn't delivered portions of the story with lengthy dialogue in play-style.<br /><br />I'm glad I read and I plan to fill in the gaps in my reading by adding more Fitzgerald to my Kindle.

1423101499|4.0|I read this book Christmas night after waiting months to read it.  I was not let down.  This book takes place mainly in the legendary Labyrinth, which is one of the most well known Greek Mythology sites.  The Labyrinth is a maze filled with all kinds of horrors, and Percy and his friends must figure out how to navigate it before the titan army can.  The book can be a little slow in some parts, but it is still defiantly one of my favorites in the series.  It brings in several new characters, as well as old ones, and sets the plot just right for the last book.  If you have read the rest of the series, you should defiantly not skip this one before heading toward the last book of this amazing series filled with Greek mythology.

0762434279|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is a very well written book that should be read by everybody! It explains the #1 rule of financial freedom AND building wealth in a way that anyone can easily understand. This is the first book I would recommend reading if you're interested in becoming financially free. Before I get into what makes this book so good, I would like to disclose what this book does not provide:<br /><br />-It is not the only book you will ever need on personal finance. This is the best FIRST step. Additional, steps (reading) will be needed.<br />-This book is not a \\"how to\\" book. It is basically a philosophy on how to view money and understand how to use it.<br />-It is not a \\"get rich quick\\" scheme. Becoming wealthy and financially free takes time.<br /><br />With that being said, if you want to become financially free one day, you will have to use these principles described in this book and other books in this series. (And other books too) Some of the basic principles in the Rich Dad teachings are:<br /><br />-Poor people work for money. Rich people have their money work for them.<br />-Rich people turn trash into cash. Poor people turn their cash into trash.<br />-Poor people trade their time for money. Rich people trade their money for time.<br /><br />Basically, you have to figure out a way to have your money work hard for you by making you more money. You're always going to need income. If you have to work for income, you'll always be working because you will always need money. The object is to get out of this \\"rat race,\\" as he calls it. You do this by buying assets that put money back into your pocket. Income-producing assets. Read this book and take your first step towards financial freedom!

Gladwell does a great job of drawing the reading in an capturing their attention. The problem appears to be that he doesn't know what to do with the reader's attention once he has it. His other two books kept me hooked from cover to cover. This one lost me halfway through. Some of the examples he brings up in the book seem out of place to say the least. He also skips around a lot from example to unrelated example trying to make his point. By then end of the book, I wasn't even sure what his point was. I would definitely recommend \\"Outliers\\" and \\"The Tipping Point\\"; however, don't waste your money on \\"Blink\\".

B00006FDCD|1.0|There are two ways to look at this early nineties TV movie (which really means that it's an 80's TV movie): on it's own or as an adaptation of Stephen King's book.  Either way, it's a pretty big failure.<br /><br />They got one thing right: Tim Curry.  He does a great job of an alternatingly unnerving and terrifying Pennywise.<br /><br />But that's about it.  The rest of the casting was weak to awful.  Some of the kids were okay - Brandon Crane as Ben, Seth Green as Richie and Adam Faraizl as Eddie were all pretty close to what the characters in the book were. Even Marlon Taylor as Mike and Jarred Blancard as Henry Bowers were pretty good.  But Emily Perkins as Bev was woefully miscast.  She wasn't bad, per se, but this is supposed to be a young girl who is stunning - which Perkins is not.  Jonathan Brandis as Stuttering Bill does one of the worst fake stutters I've ever heard and the rest of his acting isn't partticularly better.<br /><br />But it's better than their adult counterparts.  Who allowed this casting director to do another movie after this?  Richard Thomas (who does just as bad if not a worse stutter as his young counterpart) looks nothing like Jonathan Brandis, but even HE is closer than Richard Masur's supposed growth from model-good-looking Ben Heller into..... well..... pasty Richard Masur.

(In a REALLY bad sequence, to boot....)

B0034JKZ86|2.0|Disappointing in so many ways. Too fast-paced for the length of the movie. Characters weren't memorable or even well-developed - Tiana is a FROG for 80% of the movie, for crying out loud! Plot is too complicated, humor is forced and slightly awkward. Disney movies (good ones anyway) always have certain sparkle that makes them enjoyable for people of all ages. This movie DID NOT have it. It pales in comparison to Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Aladdin, everything. I had hoped for the Princess and the Frog to at least match the classics in terms of music and storyline. Sorry Disney, it didn't work for me.<br /><br />Here's where I think it went wrong. 1)The producers tried way too hard to cater to the black community. Anticipating the premiere, I read all the articles about how Disney revised and revised Tiana's name, appearance, and occupation. Relax! The story matters way more than the texture of Tiana's hair! I'm black and that doesn't even concern me. 2)Poor choice of fairy tale. The princess and the frog is literally a two-sentence long story! The producers were forced to add that dumb twist about the spell not working - sorry excuse for a storyline! 3)Way too much time spent on scenery and special effects, not enough on music and plot. Right now I can't even remember what the story is even about, let alone recall one song.<br /><br />It's not like Disney lost its magic touch. Mulan and Aladdin are fairly recent films, and I love both. Tangled, made in 2010, is a beautiful, hilarious film that actually deserves to be mentioned along with the other classics. It was even made Pixar-style. Yes, Disney still has the potential to create modern classics. It's just that when race gets tangled into the mix (we all know Walt Disney was an unashamed racist) everyone gets uncomfortable. Truthfully, I'd trade a black princess for worthwhile entertainment.
B0018PJEYY|3.0|I have listened to this album countless times in both vinyl and CD formats. This is not a great rendition of the music in therms of the audio mix. The music is great, but I can't figure out why they didn't do a better job on the re-mix.

B001P3OMY6|5.0|Austenland is a resort for Mr. Darcy fanatics. Upon arriving, you step back to the enchanting time of fancy ball gowns, enormous estates, and luxuries beyond compare. Following the strict rules of high-brow society, guests are treated to a realistic version of the world Jane Austen created in her books. Dreamy!  Go ahead and admit that you think it sounds awesome too.    When her Aunt Carolyn passes away, she leaves Jane with a paid vacation to Austenland. This is the most amazing gift that anyone could possibly give to Jane. You see, Jane is obsessed with Mr. Darcy and also Colin Firth playing Mr. Darcy in the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. Following a string of unfortunate romances, no man can compare to Mr. Darcy in Jane's eyes.    When she arrives in Austenland, Jane is simply hoping to take a break from reality in the make-believe setting. Instead, she finds that perhaps there is a guy who lives up to her high ideals. And, perhaps, his name is not Mr. Darcy. Isn't that just the sweetest plot ever?    Shannon Hale is one of my all-time favorite authors. Her books are ones that I read over and over again. Austenland will be one of those special books. Even better, Midnight in Austenland releases next year. I am counting the days.    RATING    5 Loved    COVER COMMENTS    How cute! I love the huge estate and Jane arriving for her vacation. Look at that gorgeous blue sky. Even that little swirl above the title is regal.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is  my first review on Amazon and I buy MANY things....so I actually found something I felt the need to write a review about.  The 30 day shred workout is a great workout!  I use this DVD all the time, when I am too busy to make it the gym or if I want to bring a DVD with me when I travel and at home in the morning before work. This is also a great workout if you haven't hit the gym in the while and need something to jump start you back into a good workout routine.  Sometimes I feel like I have exercise ADHD...one week I am really into running, the next I only want to go to the gym, etc.  the 30 Day Shred is probably the most consistant workout I have actually kept in my routine. I wake up an extra 30 minutes in the morning (which really is not hard to do!) and put on the DVD before I start getting ready for work.  That way I have at least had one workout for the day and if I feel like I could use a little more weights or exercies...I go for a run or pick up some free weights around my house and get in a second workout for the day......but regardless I always have that morning workout!  Great way to start the day!  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.
1594744769|5.0|Look at the cover. It is an old photo of a girl in ruffles in the woods. Look closer. She is FLOATING. Peculiar? For sure. That photo is the first of many creepy vintage photos of peculiar children found throughout the book. They make this story come to life.    Jacob's grandfather spent a good part of his childhood in a remote orphanage off the coast of Wales. Jacob has grown up with his grandfather sharing unbelievable stories about the peculiar children in that orphanage. Well, those stories weren't completely unbelievable because Jacob's grandfather had old photos to prove they were real. When his grandfather dies, Jacob journeys to the orphanage to find answers and see for himself. I love how Ransom Riggs puts so much thought into the setup for the story.    At the orphanage, Jacob discovers that these peculiar children really did once exist. There was an invisible boy and a girl who could create fire out of thin air to name a few. Each child's description would be crazier than the one before. So creepily good!    Once Jacob learns the fate of the children, he finds himself in a bizarre situation with them. It's one of the most unusual twists to plot that I have ever read.  Unexpected in a good way and perfect for a book about peculiar children.     If you crave something different, something peculiar, then you will go crazy for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.  Take a chance on something unusual.        RATING    5 Loved    COVER COMMENTS    There could be no more perfect cover than this haunting photo of a floating girl.

I wish there was a 4th book but I'm glad Katniss won't have to go through any more pain anymore.  The hard thing was trying to skim over long paragraphs so I could see what happened and then suddenly in that paragraph I tried skimming 10 people die.  Don't try to skip through, you'll miss a ton.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Take a linear narrative, throw in a dash of chaos, and you end up with Hesher, a film that debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010 but didn't see an official theatrical release until 2011. Playing with the person-helps-grieving-family storyline we've seen countless times, this is one of those indie dramas that assembles a cast of well-known actors and allows them to branch out from what's expected of them. The story, whether good or bad, functions as an opportunity for actors to play against type in a way that a typical mainstream movie wouldn't allow. Hardly a surprise, Hesher opened to mixed reviews with the majority of praise going to the actors and the majority of complaints going to the script and film itself. Well, with performances of this caliber and a story that is stronger than it has been given credit for; this film is actually quite successful.    T.J. (Devin Brochu) and his father Paul (Rainn Wilson) have recently suffered a traumatic loss that leaves them living with T.J.'s grandmother (Piper Laurie) and retreating into depression. T.J., who has found himself frequently tormented at school, becomes reclusive from those around him, while Paul wanders around the house in a prescription drug-induced daze. One day, T.J. stumbles upon Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose name and presence seem to be accompanied by the music of Metallica. In a classic example of deus ex machina, Hesher appears out of nowhere, with no back-story, and no reason to be in the film. He looks like a Grunge-era reject, drives a beat-up old van, has an upraised middle finger tattooed on his back, and seems to embrace chaos. He's also indifferent to societal rules; willfully disrespectful, vulgar, and violent. Despite T.J.'s protests, he moves into T.J.'s house and no one seems to care. During this time, T.J. meets Nicole (Natalie Portman), a young woman who captures his attention but turns her own attention to Hesher.     There are some inconsistencies in the script, particularly in regards to the title character. There is no logical reason for him to be in this film and his entire existence is disconnected from everything around him. The writers struggle to stay true to this strange character as he seems abnormally out-of-this-world one moment and like a human being with feelings and a conscience the next. It's a predictable move for this film to shape him from an ominous, violent thug into a caring, gentle soul; but luckily Gordon-Levitt is a gifted enough actor to make this transformation believable. Levitt crossed the threshold from child actor to real actor long ago, so there's no need to provide further proof about his acting ability. Regardless, Hesher is a great character role despite the inability of the film to define just who/what the character is. Once Levitt appears in character, it's impossible to take your eyes off him and who else but Levitt could make Hesher's speech at the end reach such a level of comic poignancy? Aside from Hesher, who is only truly developed from the performance rather than the script, the characters here are very well-developed and are brought to life marvelously.     This is the second time this year that Wilson has branched out from his Office character to prove what a gifted actor he is. There's very little humor in his character, giving Wilson the chance to stretch his acting muscles and bring Paul through a seamlessly convincing character arc. Brochu is a gifted young talent who brings some real, convincing emotional depth to the character of T.J. and Laurie, as the grandmother, is a lovely addition to the cast.    Hesher is an unapologetically weird little film that is destined to be misunderstood by most audiences. This little oddity of an indie drama is dark and violent, but ultimately sweet and hopeful and even funny at times.  By the time Hesher reaches the end of his character arc, it's all a bit contrived, but, call me crazy, I was quite fond of it. It plays with a traditional formula, isn't afraid to take chances, and boasts some very memorable performances. It's no masterpiece, but it's an enticing, satisfying film that kept me glued to the screen for its entire running time.    GRADE: A-
0553801473|4.0|So it is finally here. We waited a long time! But now will it live up to all those built up expectations?<br />The answer is: yes, it pretty much does.<br />The pace is good, a lot of things happen, most of the main characters get a good chunk of camera time and we see some new PoV characters and therefore new perspectives.<br />GRRM particularly spends time on exploring new areas of the exotic eastern continent, which I found interesting.<br />The Tyrion chapters I enjoyed particularly, both because of the character and the diverse things happening to him. It seems that fate continues to like to toy with him.<br />Jon's chapters progressed the story somewhat, but were perhaps not as engrossing since the battle with the wildlings is done and he is forced to host Stannis..<br />Dany, for a change, I was perhaps least keen on. Her personality change is perhaps a bit too extreme and actually not all that much really happened with her. Until nearly the end of the book that is.<br />Arya's story advances a bit, but was not as interesting as in previous books.<br />Theon's chapters are disturbing but, I find, very well written. As is the whole dynamic around Ramsay Bolton later on.<br />Bran's trip north of the Wall reaches its destination, a bit slowly, but nevertheless, once he gets there it takes a new twist..<br />Davos is interesting, as always, with a fine bit of politicking seen through his eyes in White Harbour.<br />We also look through Melisandre's eyes for a change, which is insightful to say the least.<br />3,5 stars, would have been a solid four if the wait hadn't been so long.<br />And Victarion gets some screentime to show off how badeass he is. As does Asha.<br />Some of the others got little more than cameos, especially Jaime.<br />Not at all seen are Brienne, Loras, Sansa, Margaery, Petyr Baelish, anyone in the Vale, Euron Greyjoy, Aeron Greyjoy, Catelyn and Sam and Company
B000P0J09C|4.0|Full Metal Jacket is a unique entry in the Stanley Kubrick canon, as it's not quite a masterpiece but is as iconic and frequently discussed as his other films. Released in 1987, seven years after his previous film The Shining, Kubrick tackles the then-popular subject of the Vietnam War but puts his own Kubrickian spin on it. At 117 minutes, Full Metal Jacket was the shortest film Kubrick had made since 1964 despite a first and second half that seem like two different films.    As if any introduction is necessary, the film opens with Marine Corps recruits entering training at Parris Island and meeting Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), who intends to turn the recruits into hardened marines during their stay. Even those who haven't seen the film know about the opening scene, featuring Gunnery Sergeant Hartman meeting the recruits and spouting some oft-quoted dialogue that has become a part of the cultural vernacular. The first seven minutes is arguably one of the greatest opening scenes in film history. It's certainly one of the most iconic. Out of all the recruits, the film centers attention on Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'onofio), a simple, overweight recruit who incurs Hartman's wrath and is nicknamed \\"Gomer Pyle.\\" As Hartman begins putting the recruits through their training, he endlessly harasses the simple-minded Private Pyle, eventually pairing him up with Joker in the hopes that it will improve Pyle's skill. These scenes at Parris Island feature some of the most hilarious, depressing, and fascinating stuff that Kubrick ever shot and it's all over after a mere 45 minutes.     I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is an undisputed masterpiece. After the Parris Island scenes, it essentially becomes a different film with the locale switching abruptly from South Carolina to Vietnam circa January of 1968. Here, Joker is a journalist accompanied by Private First ClassRafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), a combat photographer. With the beginning of the Tet Offensive, Joker and Rafterman are sent to cover the enemy attacks in South Vietnam. Here, Joker is reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard), one of the recruits at Parris Island, now a Sergeant and second-in-command of the Lusthog Squad. We're introduced to several members of the Lusthog Squad, most memorably Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) a machine gunner, who's given some of the most interesting dialogue about the war effort.  The two halves of Full Metal Jacket are so disassociated from each other it's hard to believe, at times, they're from the same film. The second half is strong, very strong in fact, and effectively entertaining; but it fails to live up to the momentum of the first half and is simply not as memorable as what came before it. Even so, the climactic standoff with the sniper is one of the strongest scenes in the entire film.    England was used as a substitute for Vietnam and is beautiful at times, while at others Kubrick's Vietnam more closely resembles a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Even with the onslaught of Vietnam-related films that had been coming out of Hollywood and picking up accolades for the several years leading up to this film's release, not a single frame of this film seems overly familiar. Kubrick's composition of the most minor, seemingly insignificant shot was and remains awe-inspiring. Kubrick's Vietnam film may not be the best Vietnam film, but it certainly has some of the most memorable imagery. Oddly enough, there is something lacking from this film in regards to Kubrick's style. Perhaps it's the lack of classical music that characterizes so many of Kubrick's films and really lend to the atmosphere and style, but Full Metal Jacket, as a whole, lacks the distinct Kubrickian atmosphere that can be spotted in all of his output from 1968 on even by the most untrained eye. There are the unbroken, static shots that seem so still even when there's movementas well as the dead-stare of characters descending into madness that give him away, but there's a tone that's noticeably missing from this film.    Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, who co-wrote the script with Kubrick and Michael Herr, the film is not overtly political and lacks a defined pro or anti stance on war, but that doesn't make it a straight-forward war film either. With Joker sporting the iconic words \\"Born to Kill\\" on his helmet, while wearing a peace sign on his flak jacket and discussing the duality of man (\\"the Jungian thing\\") with his Major, there's enough of the high-minded here to give a Kubrick disciple plenty to analyze. However, it's no wonder that out of Kubrick's other efforts Full Metal Jacket has arguably been most embraced by the average moviegoer and teenager.     Full Metal Jacket features some stunning and unforgettable performances, particularly R. Lee Ermey (credited without the \\"R.\\") and D'onofio. There is absolutely nothing I can say about Ermey's brilliant performance that hasn't already been said and D'onofrio too has received his share of acclaim for his sympathetic, tragic performance. There's plenty of great acting across the board here, but the acting is less consistent than one would expect from a Kubrick film (him being such a perfectionist). There are very minor, almost unnoticeable moments where an actor will briefly appear, unconvincingly deliver his dialogue, and disappear. There is nothing glaringly bad, but there are a few moments where the actors just don't seem up to snuff.    This is overall a lesser film for Stanley Kubrick, the only one of his films released between 1969 and 1999 that isn't a masterpiece. With that in mind, this shows what a phenomenal filmmaker Kubrick was as most directors would hope that one of their lesser films was of this quality. It's not that Full Metal Jacket isn't a masterpiece in comparison to his other films, it's just lacking in certain areas that keep it from being a masterpiece itself. There's a lack of cohesion between the two parts of the film; they exist so far apart from each other that it almost feels like a great film was cut short and a good film, with some great scenes, was edited onto it. It's a near-masterpiece and an undeniable cultural landmark, a film that will stand the test of time among Kubrick's other work. The biggest problem with Full Metal Jacket is that is has scenes many will remember forever and others they'll quickly forget.    GRADE: B

I would recommend this book for anyone who already has a profitable business model and is interested in expanding and growing. The strategies in this book really tend to focus on that part of the business and not in starting your own. If you are looking for techniques on how to start your own company I wouldn't recommend this book.
1400032717|5.0|Review of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time            As a student in the modern world, I have met and befriended many autistic children within various school systems. Never, though, had I been able to understand just how their minds were any different from mine. Thankfully, Mark Haddon came up with an answer by writing his award-winning The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, a heart-wrenching and brilliant murder mystery that follows a fifteen-year-old autistic boy named Christopher John Francis Boone on what turns out to be the roller coaster ride of a lifetime.     Christopher's adventure begins in his neighborhood in Swindon, Wiltshire, when he finds his neighbor's dog, named Wellington, speared by a pitchfork in its owner's front yard. After being incarcerated (only partly) under the suspicion that he is the murderer, Chris decides to investigate the crime. Facing pressure from his father, a widower named Ed Boone, to stop investigating, it soon becomes clear that no savant could have predicted the sheer size and impact that Christopher's curious case has on his own life.     There is more to enjoy from this book than the plot, however. Through his own experience with special-needs children, Mark Haddon composes the perfect voice for Christopher, establishing his life and mindset to be ever-reasoning, able to find an interesting explanation for everything. Even some of the less profound parts of the book makes one realize just how confusing our behaviors can be to a completely rational person, for example, his description of a sigh: \\". . . It can mean that you are relaxed, or that you are bored, or that you are angry, and it all depends on how much air comes out of your nose and how fast and what shape your mouth is . . . and how you are sitting and what you said just before and hundreds of other things which are too complicated to work out in a few seconds\\" (15).     With these interesting explanations, though, also comes a sub-plot: Christopher is a math whiz. In fact, he is the first person to take the math A-level in his entire school. Not only that, but he manages to find a mathematical way to explain everything, be it rabbit populations, faults of intuition, battle tactics, or how to make the choices in your life. Overall, these deviations, while helping to support statements within the text, are also quite entertaining and insightful, and prove to be great, enlightening additions to the story.     Furthermore, with Christopher's tale, Haddon paints a picture to portray the thin line between truth and lies that exists in our society. As each part of the mystery unfolds, another fallacy is revealed about Christopher's life, another hardship uncovered in raising a special-needs child, and while it is heartbreaking to see the ultimate effects of the truth, Mark Haddon also makes an intriguing statement with his writing: the truth doesn't always have a happy or simple connotation. An easy, yet fascinating book to read, The Curious Case of the Dog in the Night-Time is highly recommendable, enjoyably stimulating, and reveals quite a lot of important information on the secret lives of today's misunderstood autistic children.

B004WE01YA|1.0|This is a great film, but most Disney fans already bought the Video, then the 'Work in Progress' Laserdisc, then the feature on LD, then the DVD, then the Blu-Ray, etc. So now Disney decides to milk it's loyal fan base for all it can get: $45 for a re-release - outrageous. I for one will boycott ALL such Disney 3D titles over $30 and hope that they get the message and reduce them down to less than the cost of new 3D movies like Tangled, et al, and more in line with similar products from other studios. One good thing, at least the price of the \\"basic\\" 3 disc Blu-ray is great now - I'll stick with this one...

B0042816YK|3.0|Perhaps the best compliment I can give the film \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is that it is not nearly as bad as I expected it to be, based on comments both at this site and from respected film critics.  Julia Roberts does an admirable job portraying a self-involved woman who clearly only thinks of herself.  She does show some personal growth in her year of finding herself, but ultimately, the movie left me with kind of a blah feeling, like I wanted more positive change in our protagonist (I realize this is a true story).     My wife loved the book and film, and as a middle-aged male, I suspect I wasn't the demographic they were interested in anyway when marketing this film, as I only watched it with my wife as a personal favor.  So, it could have been worse, but I clearly do not recommend watching this film if you are a middle-aged male, unless you want to keep the better half happy that you can actually stop watching the gosh-darned sports for a couple of hours and share a gosh-darn film that she actually wants to see, (for once).
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This was a brilliant film! I have an interest in religious history, and this film did a great job of capturing the conflicts between early Christians with Jews and Pagans.

B004DMIIVO|4.0|Poor Kenji may be a total math geek but sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing. The whole premise of the movie of the world wide web being taken over and corrupted is especially scary when you start to consider how more and more the world is coming to rely on easy access to the internet. Kenji offers to be a boyfriend for a weekend without really knowing what's going on and runs smack head on into a huge family with all it's pleasantries and it's problems. The in the middle of all this confusion someone steals his web alter-ego (his avatar) and starts to wreck havoc in his name.    Having married into a large (almost clannish) family I can certainly relate to the total bewilderment and wonder that Kenji experiences. The family interaction is something to behold. The sequences that take place in the virtual world are visually arresting on Blu-Ray and the action is top-notch.

032147404X|2.0|With all the good reviews I figured this book had to be good, if not great.  Yes I read some negative reviews and many people complained about the humor (even those who liked the book) but man...    I am very forgiving with nearly any type of humor.  It lightens the learning process and even if it's not funny (to me) I don't mind it.  But his is way over the top and way too much.  It's like when you have a nerdy friend that says a dumb joke and nobody laughs.  No big deal but the friend then extends the joke and still nobody laughs.  The friend then continues on and on and on until you're extremely embarassed for him.  That's what this book is like.  Mostly in the beginning so I could overlook this if the rest of the book were good.  But it's not.      Many people were right when they said it reads like an article (but longer.)  It's supposed to be a beginner book but this book will leave you having to read other books or internet pages to understand things that he doesn't explain.  Yes I know that his intention is to give you advice \\"like a buddy would\\" but you at least have to give some basic understanding.  In order to easily understand this book you need to read first and have a good understanding of aperature, white balance, focal length,etc.,etc.      This would be better described as a stage II book.  Or a stage I book where you were required to take an 01 prerequisite.  It could still have value but there's really not much in it except tips.  Tips I like.  But you could put the content of this book in an 8 page pamphlet.
0937381888|5.0|I bought this book simply because the author made an older version available for free online, which I found myself frequently going back to for information on various subjects. It was so useful that I would have felt bad for not buying a copy to support his work. There's no better source for information, and it's very nice to have a dead-tree copy next to my brew kettle when I go to battle for the next batch, rather than having to run to the computer to look something up.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a great way to discover radio stations from around the world. The only problem I have is force close when the app runs in the background. Amazon is not updated to the latest version of 4.1 either, like the Android Market.
B000002JSP|4.0|Ok , this is a three star led zep cd , which means it's a five star rock n roll cd. That means it's awesome in alot of ways. BUt being this is led zep it's unfortunately not their best work and it's hard not to want them to just let loose again. but you can sense the friction in this one, as they argue over the cover! and stuff like that. Excess was rearing it's head here but this is still a classic band that has a weaker cd from them. It got classics on it but all bands have weaker cd's . so on a led zep scale this is a 3 star but on a rock scale this is a five star.  I think most zep fans would play this one last if they were going to play them in a row. (original studio releasees that is).

Sadly, after practicing and perfecting every strategy and technique presented, I am still plagued by Zombies.  More accurately, one Zombie...my ex-wife.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|One of the best stories I've read in a long time, totally engrossing, you can't help but get caught up in it.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|Thematically the unabashedly immature songs are relatively low in number (including the ladies anthem \\"Run the World (girls)\\") but tend to be perfectly innocent fun loving club anthems that don't adversely effect the aural integrity of the album. Beyonce has always been an performer/entertainer and not a Kelly Price or Jill Scott that avoids the clubs and lays the emotion and soul on heavy. I don't understand the apparent desire for a sudden change of  persona from a portion of her fan base, even with the changes in her personal life. Especially given the immense success of past club single \\"Single Ladies\\". Beyonce is certainly in her comfort zone in this album.<br /><br />The album has an incredibly diverse sound but manages to blend well and maintain an identity. The 80's influenced \\"Party\\" relies heavily on a thick vocal harmony and a catchy saw synth pad/bass combo with simplistic synth drums providing the rhythm in the background. Beyonce keeps it in the 80's realm with the upbeat groovy jam \\"Love on Top\\". Sexy horns accent her vocals for much of the song while Beyonce croons about her love being the priority in her lovers life. \\"Rather Die Young\\" continues the trend of throwback old era influence with production and vocal arrangements stripped straight from the 70's.<br /><br />Beyonce takes it to the club with the catchy \\"Countdown\\", \\"End Of Time\\",  and \\"Run The world (girls)\\". All with a minimalist production with militaristic, bombastic, marching band appeal. Of these I'm partial to \\"End Of Time\\" with it's melodic sing songy chorus and blaring horn arrangement. \\"Run This World\\" while bound to be a hit in clubs wasn't the best choice for single as it's not as immediately appealing as her past singles.<br /><br />The album slows down with the vocally ambitious \\"1+1\\", \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" and \\"I Was Here\\". \\"1+1\\" doesn't quite live up to the ambitions set forth as the vocal inflections begin to sound slightly annoying, especially during live performances but it provides a decent but somewhat forgettable ballad. \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" is the most commercial of the bunch(and hence her 2nd single). A vengeful but very likable celebratory ode to a love that never was. While \\"I Was Here\\" has Beyonce proclaiming her desire to be remembered and having a great legacy. A mournful, plodding delivery leaves something to be desired but certainly a meaningful and heartfelt ballad.<br /><br />Other favorite is hard to pin down but very catchy \\"Start Over\\" with it's powerful and moving chorus. On the other hand \\"I Care\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" bring up the rear. While not bad they just prove to be filler material or to put it more politely, the most likely to be forgotten.<br /><br />As a whole I was very satisfied and impressed with this album. Vocally Beyonce brings it while only faltering on rare occasion. The production is great with throwback soul sounds, bombastic club anthems and melodic ballads. If you're expecting a transformed Beyonce that departs from her howling, bootylicious, hair swinging ways then you might look elsewhere for your R&B fix. But if you know the larger than life artist and performer Beyonce is and enjoy hearing her doing what she does best than I would completely recommend this album.but somewhat forgettable ballad. \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" is the most commercial of the bunch(and hence her 2nd single).

0807014273|5.0|The book is one of the most important and significant works of the past millennium. The book is a story of Victor Franklin survival in the concentration camps and the lessons he picked up during his stay. There are two parts to the book, part 1 consists of his experiences, part 2 consists of his description of Logotherapy which he strongly advocated as a cure for many of the mental issues which people suffer from. The book presses the notion that a surge in various mental illness is due to the lack of any objective for our survival. We live empty lives, which are primarily in materialistic pursuits. The author cites Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\", to promote the idea. While all of this may sound very superficial, philosophical, in all honesty, if you really have a mission to live for, and it matters a lot to you, the question of existence rarely arises. We make our mission as the meaning. This was in a way the tactics, Dr.Franklin used for survival in the camps. He made his mission helping the other patients, spreading the lessons he had learnt and so on.  He was very strongly driven by his objectives, and its no surprise that he survived the camps and went on to live till 1997.    I must confess, I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the second part, as it was primarily based on his experiences and observations. The 2nd part is a little tricky to follow if you are reading the book as a reader. You many find it more intuitive if you are professional trained for mental health and counseling.     Nevertheless, if you want to read a book which tries to give you correct hints at the path you should be taking in life, this is the perfect book. Its tries to offer a meaningful objective to your life, without pushing you towards any religion/faith.
1594202842|4.0|This book was a strange read for me. I liked the flow of the book. I liked Ms Chua's voice and writing style. That being said, I felt really sad for these girls. This parenting style (like any style) doesn't always get the results you hope for. Coming from a very strict (German Catholic) family myself, excellence was an expectation and one that, I was constantly told, I needed to deliver. By the time I was in high school, the only thing I really learned was how to get better at hiding the teenage-y things I did. There were a couple parts in the book that really struck me. There's a point, when Ms. Chua's daughter Sophia is performing at Carnegie Hall (I think she's 13 or 14) when Sophia says how strange it is that all the practice and pain she went through was for this moment. It seems anticlimactic. If you have your \\"big moment\\" at 14, what do you have to strive for during the rest of your life? Another sticking point for me is that the author (who at some point, chastises her children for making fun of someone who's different) says she doesn't want her kids to be \\"provincial\\" Americans who make fun of people from other countries or strange food. The ironic thing is, through her constant snobbery regarding class and parenting, that's EXACTLY what Ms. Chua is doing (in reverse). She makes fun of Western parenting and \\"fat Americans\\"  in the book. Through this \\"excellence over everything\\" attitude, Ms Chua is discounting so many other wonderful, often complicated, ways that there are to experience life... and parenting.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|The concert DVD in this two-pack is just what the title suggests! It captures the live concert experience perfectly. I've watched it four or five times and can't wait to watch it again. I've even shown it to a non-GD fan and made a convert. If you are familiar with \\"Bullet in a Bible,\\" another CD/DVD combo, you'll find this DVD to be almost all concert footage, no museum tours or fan interviews. And the camera direction is much better.    The CD is good, but not as good as the DVD. I would have liked to see the tracks match - the DVD has a better mix of old and newer material, while the CD tends to go back in time quite a bit. But I heartily recommend this package.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I&apos;m very happy with this app.  I travel a lot and don&apos;t like trying to figure out hotel clocks that never have the correct tme.  Easy to set and you  can wake tp your favorite music.

0739384171|4.0|I purchased these to listen to during my commute, as I drive about 2-3 hours a day. I had read the first book and it was great. The second book is not quite as good as the first book, and some parts of it seem to drag a bit, but overall the triology is very entertaining. Once you read the second book you will pretty much have to listen to the third as the second book doesn't have a conclusive ending. Also it provided a solid 25(ish) hours of listening, so it kept me occupied during my commute for a couple of weeks. Ultimately, I would recommend the book/cd version as the whole triology is worth listening to.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Awsome game, I played the heck out of it. Unfortunately once I beat the game and was trying to rack up money to buy all of the new plants it erased all of my progress! I don&apos;t know if it was operator error or the game&apos;s fault. That&apos;s why I took two stars off an otherwise 5 star game.
1591843162|5.0|Yes, I even gave a copy of this book to my boss.    Am I indispensable?  Not yet, but this book helped me understand how to get there.    Buy this book if you are trying to get ahead, if you are striving to keep your job and to do more than just fit into the work place.    Seth Godin helps the reader to understand how that person can/must bring bring the whole self to work.    I also donated a copy of this book to the members of my old Boy Scout Troop, Troop 2230, the Koshare Indian Dancers.    Inside the cover I wrote, \\"Bring your Art!\\"    Seth teaches us that the world needs 100% of our gifts and that we should give of them freely.  He talks about how each of us are artists and that we must give of our art to the world.    Buy the book.  You will find yourself called to do greater things for your work, your family and your community.    CGB
B005BGBPBG|1.0|If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, this is NOT it!  It takes turns that do not make sense based on the characters they present.  I really like John Krasinski but, I don't even know why he was in this.  He is just along for the ride here and there.  SPOILER WARNING:  His character's relationships makes no sense and his story never gets wrapped up at the end.  There were so many better ways that this storyline could have taken.  I had high hopes for this movie and was very disappointed.  (I have never written a review before but, I had to on this one because it was that disappointing.)
B000067FP8|5.0|This movie brings me happy memories back from the early nineties. Some of the effects might look old fashioned compared to what we have nowadays, but it's still amazing. Definetely a classic must-have!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am not sure why the reviews are so negative for this book.  I just discovered these books back in July, and have not been able to stop reading.  I started with the 4 book set and continued on with this book.  I have to say I love it as much as I loved reading the other four.  My only complaint is not knowing what has become of Sansa and not enough of Jamie and Cersie.  But, at the end of the fourth book he told us this book would continue with characters not in the fourth book.  I guess if I had read the first four several years ago and was wanting closure I would be disapointed.  But, reading the other four and then this one at once, I could hardly put it down.  I love these books!!!!!!!  I cannot stand the thought of waiting years for the sixth book!
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Very nice watch for men, can be combined both with sport and formal wear. Feels a bit heavy if not tight on the wrist, but definitely a good choice.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Surprisingly, I enjoyed this film much more because I had read both Something Borrowed and Something Blue before seeing the film. Knowing the dynamic of Rachel's and Darcy's friendship as well as the history between Rachel and Dex helped me enjoy the movie from the very first scene. The cast was fantastic, John Krasinski as Ethan made me laugh in just about every scene and the chemistry between Rachel and Dex didn't disappoint.     The film stayed true to the book for the most part, it was funny without trying too hard, and overall was one of my favorite movies of the year. If you love well made romantic films or just a film that makes you feel good, definitely give Something Borrowed a go.     Oh... if you get to watch the DVD, the deleted scenes are some of the best ones I've seen in awhile. There are some with Ethan that I wish they would have left in the film and one with Dex that was fairly entertaining. Enjoy!
B0043U937Y|5.0|Highly recommend this show... And the prequel too (which should still be seen *after* this season 1 to avoid spoilers)... Can't wait for the third installment Sparticus: Vengeance.<br /><br />Graphic, violent, excellent...
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I am a huge fan of music, but I get bored relatively easy.  This disc is the exception, the more I listen the more I fall in love with her music!  She's real and honest, and that truly sets her apart.  Great and fantastic CD!!
0553274503|5.0|Reading this book definitely gave a perspective of a mentally retarded individual which I did not expect to have gained. It was such an ingenious novel in how it gives a hypothetical voice to a character with retardation, when in reality, we don't really know how individuals like Charlie feel about their lives. Throughout the novel, I really felt for Charlie in how he deals with social expectations from before and after the surgery that increased his IQ. At first I thought this novel would be dry because the plot seemed so \\"sci-fi\\" and unrealistic, but the emotions that were brought out while the story unfolded really shocked me in that I have a greater appreciation for life.   I would highly recommend this book!

B004YEJGEO|5.0|I have yet to review an app but this such a great one to have, I have to let people knows.  I&apos;m surprised that it&apos;s not in the top ten.  I like that it is so casual, no timers, no pressure, just solve the puzzle.  I like that it gives the option for pigment and light and that you can create different solution files.  It is not perfect, a few glitches, but that becomes part of the challenge.  Identifying them and working around them.\n\nGot it when it was free, have been playing on and off during down time and am always satisfied with the level of entertainment provided.  Would easily pay $3.00 for the replay value and the gradual difficulty.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It's autumn in Westeros, blizzards are already blasting the Seven Kingdoms with brutal force, and \\"winter is coming.\\" Jon Snow is treading a dangerously fine line between keeping the vows of the Brothers of the Night's Watch and involvement with King Stannis' revolt. Tyrion is on the run for his life and hopes to find an ally with Queen Daenerys, but as is always the case with the Imp, he just manages to trade one peril for greater ones. It is Daenerys' destiny to reclaim the Iron Throne for the Targaryens, but doing so now means leaving her conquered city to her enemies and the slaves she has freed to their former masters. Meanwhile, her dragons are growing bigger and more unmanageable. As all the great houses make their bid for who will rule the Seven Kingdoms, north of the Wall the restless dead are gathering en masse to invade with the winter storms, adding slain victims to their ranks.<br /><br />Just as all the previous books in A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE have been, A Dance with Dragons is a tombstone-sized doorstopper of a book. (I purchased the Amazon Kindle version, and I swear my Kindle was heavier after I uploaded it.) An age has passed since A Game of Thrones kicked off what just might become the most influential series in fantasy since LORD OF THE RINGS. I've been anticipating A Dance with Dragons ever since I read the last sentence of the last book, A Feast for Crows, almost six years ago.<br /><br />A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a colossal-sized epic. There is no getting around the fact that this series is really one long book. I think Mr. Martin's idea of a conclusion for each book has been to build up to the most shockingly climactic outcome imaginable and then leave the readers in a nearly painful lurch of a cliffhanger. (Fair warning: the ending of A Dance with Dragons is no exception.) This is made almost intolerable by the fact that fans will be lucky to get more than one installment per decade.<br /><br />But if you can put all that aside and just takethe events as they happen in A Dance with Dragons, there's no denying it's another grand adventure.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin is one of those authors who could write the Yellow Pages and make it exciting. As complex and as large-as-life as this story is, and even considering how long it's been since I last visited his world, I had no problem keeping up with A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Martin has created some of the most interesting characters ever, and there are so many of them. It's amazing how he can tell a story from so many unique perspectives. I'm not sure I even know as many people living in the real world as there are living and dying within these books.<br /><br />He draws the plot out like a sharp blade from a scabbard -- one that will easily cut the careless. His underlying theme that every hero is the other side's villain is profound and believable. All the players in this deadly game of thrones have a strategy that seems like a guaranteed victory. But since Martin solidly established early on, that no one -- I repeat, no one -- is safe, it's anyone's guess who will hold the Iron Throne when this is done. Providing there will even be a throne to win. That will depend on the Crows holding the Wall against the wights and other monsters that have yet to strike in full force.<br /><br />It almost seems impossible that Martin will actually be able to wrap this thing up with a worthy conclusion, and do it in both his and his readership's lifetime. Call me crazy, but I think he can. Afterwards, blurbs on fantasy book-covers will claim comparisons to George R.R. Martin and A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, like they do now for J.R.R. Tolkien and LORD OF THE RINGS.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I've got the video in less than a week. The only problem I have is they don't have an English subtitle.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I first saw this video at a friend`s house - it was a wonderfully emotional experience./  I just HAD to own this;  I know I shall never get to the Waldbuhne amphitheatre, so to have a view of this impressive venue, to hear such wonderfully resonant three voices - it was magnificent.

0300169787|5.0|The Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibit at the MET was amazing. I wish it was a permanent exhibit. If you did not get a chance to see the exhibit in person than this is the next best thing. There are a few pages of text which discuss McQueen's life, both in the fashion world and a bit of his personal life but the bulk of the book are high res, full page pictures of the clothes that were on display in the exhibit. If you did manage to see the exhibit in person, owning this book will help you relive the experience again and again. Very inspiring. Worth every penny.
0553801473|4.0|Contrary to many, I am overall pretty satisfied with George RR Martin's A Dance With Dragons. Does it have problems? Well, yeah, and some of those are huge. But is it the worst book of the series, deserving of the derision and vitriol that's been heaped upon it by lots of reviewers? Certainly not. Allow me to elaborate.<br /><br />I won't recount the plot here (if plot is even the right word...meandering at times, achingly slow and then devastatingly wicked at others); there's entirely too much going on. Most of the chapters are Tyrion's, Jon's, and Dany's points of view, but others surface as well, including Theon, Davos, Jaime, Cersei, and Arya. There were a couple of POVs I must admit to being puzzled by, but I have to hope that ultimately Martin will bring them to a satisfying intricacy with the main characters. Would I have loved to know what Brienne and Sansa were up to? Sure, but it's all right. We're moving along, however slowly, and lots of Tyrion is always worth it.<br /><br />Biggest complaints? Well, the pacing is off in the first two hundred pages or so, with way too much detail given to traveling woes and feasting items. In any other series, these would be deal breakers. Do I think Martin's editor was snoozing? Probably. Just because you are uber successful doesn't mean you should be allowed to enumerate every food on a table. My other big, huge complaint is that it had been so long since I'd read A Feast For Crows, I was LOST for a hundred pages. That's my own fault for not rereading, but I also lay some blame on Martin, since five years between books is inexcusable.<br /><br />What I liked? Lots of things.The dialogue is perfect and the intrigue is thick. We got vintage Martin with double crosses, lots of gore, and set ups galore. Loved, loved, loved Theon's comeuppance and what he does later in the novel; loved Barristan Selmy's honor; loved the twist with Rhaegar's son. I found what happened with Dany and her dragons distasteful, yet entirely plausible; I know that the bloodletting has only barely begun after Cersei's humiliation. And poor Jon Snow...always trying to do the right thing, but it's usually at the wrong time and with the wrong people.<br /><br />Martin's world is convoluted, overblown, and nasty, much like the world we live in today. His writing, however, while needing editing, still draws one in and builds suspense, causing me to continue turning pages and luxuriating within the boundaries of the Seven Kingdoms and Beyond. Personally, I'm invested for the long haul, even if A Dance With Dragons pales when compared to A Storm of Swords. It's not the comparison I try to keep in mind, it's the journey.ible; I know that the bloodletting has only barely begun after Cersei's humiliation.

B004Y1WCDE|3.0|Its been 3 months and no updates. there are a few things that need to be added to make this a great app. The music playback portion of the app needs work, feels kludgy, the notification icon and functionality feels out of place and like it was slapped together. the video portion works better, and is enjoyable. this has a lot of potential, and I love the idea of a centralized server that streams to multiple devices, but at this point I prefer other offerings.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is definitely an upgrade from your average stock fan. I was running at temps around 42 idle and 59-60 under load (AMD) and with this fan installed I run at about 36 idle and 48-50 load. The fan makes practically no noise at all. The installation was a bit of a struggle as many others state, but its not because of the concept (fairly simple) but because it may take you a few trys before you get it screwed in right etc, and the fact that you may have to take your motherboard out if the back is not accessible. The fan took me about an hour and a half to install. Before you buy this, I highly recommend you check your case specs compared to the fan specs, because it is rather large. If you have the CM HAF 912 Mid-Tower, it should fit just fine. I do not regret my decision to purchase this at all, and I hope you decide to do the same.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|So I personally do not own one but many of my friends do so I have used this controller on multiple occasions. The contoller seems to have a bit too much grip and I noticed that on all 3 controllers the right analog stick is slightly higher than the one on the left, hence why it feels a tiny bit awkward to hold... my friends kept talking about it so i looked at the controller and noticed this slight problem. However it is still a nice controller to use for a short period of time like 30 minutes.  But if your certain u prefer the 360 controller to the ps3 this may just be your answer, just know it isn't exactly the same, but very close.
0307266303|5.0|Amazing! I loved this book. I am by no means a reader, in fact, I haven't read a book in about 10 years, attempted several times but either I lost interest or just simply didn't want to finish the book. This book was the first one that I read from cover to cover and not only did I finish it but I ordered two more running books!!! It proves that you can do anything you set your mind to. I run, and I love it. Still learning to get my body to appreciate it as much as my mind does...my husband and will be competing in the Hood To Coast Relay for the first time this next week. \\"Born To Run\\" was a recommended reading for the race. Born and raised in Oregon, I found the connections with the University of Oregon and NIKE facinating, such a \\"small world\\" haha. I'm not into evolution, but it was certainly interesting to read his point of view on it and why it is that we were born to run. Awesome book!! Enjoy.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Easily the best that I have watched. BBC and Attenborough have a done a great job covering practically every aspect of Planet Earth. It is a rare one in which the producers celebrate the planet and save the preachings for the bonus disc, than lament about destruction. Some of the best in wildlife photography as we see in the 10 minute dairies after each disc. Totally worth it!
0553801473|1.0|I started reading these books after hearing that HBO was going do its series about 2 years ago.  Like many have stated, I found the first 3 books to be some of the best fantasy I have ever read (limited though that may be).  Book 4 though missing many of the best characters was a bit of a disappoinment, but still good relative to most fantasy.<br /><br />As I read ADWD I was struck that it seems Martin was writing this book with one thought in mind; how would this play out on TV and could this help build another season of Game of Thrones on HBO.  Much like nothing ever really happens to Sookie,Bill and the rest on True Blood with the same main characters swirling around but never really getting any where.  In this book, there were lots of little events that take place surrounding Tyrion, Dany, Jon etc., with some nice end of season cliffhangers (i.e. Jon).  However, nothing much happened that seemed to advance the story.  I found Dany's arc highly dissapointing as was Tyrion's as both were exactly where they started the book.  Jon's was good but his final decisions were questionable given the character we have read so much about to say the least.  Also the forward makes this outcome seem rather obvious.<br /><br />Overall, I read the book rapidly and wanted to see what happened but finished feeling very unfulfilled.  Versus some other books I have read this was maybe four stars, but versus my expectations and Martins other ASOIAF books it was a one star, thus my 2 star rating.<br /><br />A bit of rambling review, but wanted to lend my voice to those out there trying to let George know we are not satisfied and would like something better next time (as far away as that may be, a sad discovery I made after getting into this series and discovering the author's proclivity for doing anything BUT write these books).
B002BWP4A6|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece.  Haneke, the movie's director, does a unique, totally different from others productions work.  The white ribbon symbolizes the inocence, the goodness.  In the movie, the grown-ups in town give them children a white ribbon, so they stay pure, inocent, white.  But that's not so. Evilness is in all men. Men is the only animal that has this feeling in it.  There's anybody (except God) who hasn't done enything mean ones.  That's the movies point.  It's not about giving the story a closed ending, about solving a mystery.  It's about showing a point.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|This is my first ever Cirque show and so am very impressed at who they are and what they do. Thouroughly impressed with the music in 7.1 surround.     3D is very good and its more depth than pop out....which itself is very good and you almost feel like hovering over the pond in one of the scenes...they should have added more camera movement to draw you more into the show.     Somehow i felt the whole show is cloudy and not sharp...but this is definitely worth the less than $15 price tag.
0307588335|5.0|As a recent graduate looking to broaden my financial understanding, this book provided an excellent perspective on the world of trading and the corporate structure. In addition, it was an excellent read with a gripping, fast-paced storyline. Larry's story is very interesting and his former colleagues at Lehman are also inspirational. Great for commercial awareness, great for a deeper understanding and well-worth a read!
B000001ESF|5.0|Ok, I bought this album later after I had Moving Pictures and Signals, and this is one of the better ones. I love this record and Rush is a band that has TRULY EARNED popularity. I'm not gonna get into this topic, but if you wanna know why, watch the documentary: Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage. 2112 really captures what Rush had been trying to make since the addition of Neil Peart (Best Drummer in History). There won't ever be another voice even remotely close to Geddy Lee because no one in their right mind would wanna sing like that! I mean Geddy is amazing but I don't think anyone would wanna sing like that!    Music:    Back then, regardless of what those idiot critics said, this was a ground-breaking and innovative album; Rush have become the true masters of Progressive Rock.    1. 2112- This was the first epic I ever heard and it's also got the coolest drumming on anything that was made before Dream Theater, Symphony X, Kamelot, and Stratovarius were formed. Very good song!    2. A Passage to Bangkok- A catchy little tune...perfect for traveling. Haha!    3. The Twilight Zone- A slower paced song but never the less, a Rush Classic.    4. Lessons- It's an ok song, but I don't really care for it.    5. Tears- I LOVE this song! Until I heard this, I didn't know that Rush did ballads and pretty songs. This might just be the best song on the album! Yes even better than the very innovative 2112!    6. Something for Nothing- A pretty catchy song with a good message.    Verdict: A very good album from the 70's that deserves respect! If you like Dream Theater, Iron Maiden or any metal band, then you have to respect these guys because all metal looks back to these 3 dudes. Not kidding...the documentary has people that Rush influence on there like Mike Portnoy, Trent Razor, Jack Black, and the list goes on...  Very good album and I recommend it to prog fans and people who like 70's classics.
141690977X|1.0|The grammatical structure of title alone (\\"he\\" is the subject and \\"you\\" are the object) exemplifies The Centerfold Syndrome as written by Gary Brooks. Read it ladies. 'nuff said.
B004NQUKBG|4.0|...it sounds too much like old Stratovarius. Tolkki, you are an amazing guitarist and I respect you but you need to let other people write music in your bands, too! Stratovarius was great with Tolkki and now they are 5 times better without him! I mean this album has some really good moments but in some spots it sounds like Stratovarius without Kotipelto. I know the description says every member contributes their own style but if it sounds exactly like Tolkki's old band then we've got a problem! I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the 3 stars I was originally going to give it because it's not as bad as I thought. It grew on me a bit but it still sounds like Stratovarius with Andre Matos who by the way, is also an amazing singer. I'm going to check out his other stuff altho he probably sounds best here because even if he's not always original, Tolkki is on heck of a songwriter!    Music:    1. Fields of Avalon- Yes, this sounds like a Strato. song but it's very catchy and I think Kotipelto wouldn't have sang this particular one as good as Matos did. Well done! Also, this is the best song here.    2. Come by the Hills- Another Strato. type song, tho not nearly as much. This does sound a bit different. I like this one's chorus because it's very catchy.    3. Santiago- This is one of the more Stratovarius style songs here. A good song and Kotipelto would have sang this just as good. I like this one still, tho. I wonder why I've never heard of Matos before, he's really good!    4. Alayna- A ballad. And this is the first song on the album that I can't compare to Stratovarius! That's definitely a good thing. Great song, too!    5. Forevermore- The beginning reminds me a little bit of \\"Rebel\\" from the Destiny album but after the intro it sounds a little like Stratovarius but the chorus is more original than you'd think.    6. Pilgrim Road- A catchy little song that also has little to no trace of Stratovarius style sound. Pretty good.    7. In Paradisum- This is the most UNORIGINAL song of the album! It sounds like Tolkki wanted to try to make another \\"Elements\\". Well that backfired! This sounds like the brainfart that eventually became the masterpiece that was put on the Stratovarius album \\"Elements Pt. 1\\" (See my review for that).    8. Rhapsody in Black- Another fast-paced Strato-style song. I like this one but not as much as the 1st half of the album.    9. I Walk in Neon- I think that this one is also unoriginal. The title makes me think of \\"I Walk to My Own Song\\" back from \\"Elements Pt. 2\\" and by coincidence (maybe), that's what it's trying to sound like! Needless to say, I don't like this one.    10. Don't Let Me Go- I like this one but, of course, it reminds me of \\"Celestial Dream\\" from \\"Infinite\\" and \\"A Drop in the Ocean\\" from \\"Elements Pt. 1\\". It's got a nice Acoustic Guitar part tho.    Note to you (The Reader): I know what you are thinking...This guy is dumb and the only music he knows is Stratovarius. That's not true. I listen to a lot of different music ranging from some modern pop such as Miley Cyrus and Miranda Cosgrove to Progressive Metal like Kamelot, Symphony X, and Stratovarius. So I know a lot more than just Stratovarius. But if you listen to a whole bunch of Stratovarius songs and then listen to this album, you'll see what I mean; Tolkki writes like he's still in Stratovarius and the result: this album which sounds pretty good. I admit I like it but I won't ever give it 5 stars because I absolutely love Stratovarius and I respect Tolkki but really? I know it's his style but he could at least let other people write for once.    Verdict: If you are into Kamelot, Stratovarius, and other Power Metal acts, then You will like it if you don't mind hearing Tolkki write and perform Stratovarius type stuff with another band. Also...Look at their logo (the little symbol above their name on the Album Cover). Then look at Stratovarius' self titled album from 2005. Does that not even remotely look like this band is trying to be what Tolkki's 1st band was?! That's all I have to say about this album and how it kinda rips off of a good band.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|It's been over two years since guitarist/singer Ana Popovic released her last album, but her latest, \\"Unconditional,\\" has made it well worth the wait. Recorded in New Orleans, it successfully fuses classic and contemporary blues into music with high energy and lots of passion. Her guitar playing is amazing and her vocals are as smooth as honey. Soulful and virtuoso are words that come to mind when listening to her play. The album also features the amazing slide guitar of Sonny Landreth and the talents of Jon Cleary and David Torkanowski on hammond B3 and piano, Calvin Turner on bass and Doug Belote on drums. The title track, \\"Unconditional,\\" has some unbelievable guitar work but also incorporates a beautiful piano which adds depth to the song. Jason Ricci makes a guest appearance and plays the harp, adding a unique and beautiful texture to the sound. I love the backbeat drumming on \\"Slideshow\\" that has a huge, pounding bass line and delivers with nothing short of a sonic boom. \\"One Room Country Shack\\" showcases Popovic's talent as a musician. She simply SHREDS the guitar on this song and it will leave you breathless. \\"Summer Rain\\" is another beautiful song that really shows the depth of Popovic's talents as a vocalist. She is sultry and powerful at the same time and the guitar solo somehow sounds like falling rain. If you like your blues straight ahead with touches of soulful jazz and beautifully raw vocals, you can't go wrong here. Highly recommended!
1439107955|5.0|One day late last year I caught an interview with the author on the radio.  I was very impressed by how he presented himself.  I had lost my mother to cancer 2 years prior and when I heard this book was a biography of cancer, I was immediately interested.    The book is a great resource for learning the history of treatments over the years and of the contributions of so many people to the understanding of the body and of cancer.  The author provides details on the \\"movers and shakers\\" of the cancer community over the years, be they scientists, surgeons or activists. I'm fascinated by medicine and the science behind it and was very pleased with what I learned from reading this book.  While it brought back some very difficult memories it also gave me a better understanding of the science behind what was going on during my mom's treatment.    Dr. Mukherjee has done an outstanding job!
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|Why do some people feel incomplete without zombies, vampires and related kin critters in their lives. Addictions take on the craziest forms.     The first few minutes of the film suggested a creatively written, good sets, well acted and directed story but soon degenerated into a scene after scene formula of a few roadies journeying to escape an apocalyptic future filled with bad humans and equally bad semi-humans to find refuge in the virgin north. It turned out to be cheaply produced for the usual obviously fake blood (raspberry jam), stakes (for vampires) in a multitude of forms, shotguns (for zombies) and trashy vehicles from a wrecking yard for ambience and, of course, the somewhat dead who always seem to walk the same way - like they're imitating some other primates.   The storyline comes down to a few of the traveling buds get toasted for vamp food, because otherwise the film would be totally devoid of emotion or suspense; nothing happens at the end except boy and girl are happy.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I adore this album to bits and pieces. It is so gorgeous to listen to and has so much emotional power. I have the cd in my car and I listen to it non-stop. My favorite tracks are Romantic Flight and Forbidden Friendship, but every track is just as amazing. I highly advise everyone to listen to How to Train Your Dragon; I hope it will make you as happy as it made me.
B000042O1O|4.0|Note that this 2000 UK release by London records(CentreDate Co Ltd.) is missing the Blue Monday single tracks, making it faithful to the original 8 tracks Factory release.    Sound quality is very good, with somewhat boosted bass and treble from the original CD release, and the dynamics do not appear to be a victim of the loudness wars. \\"Your Smiling Face\\" sounds particularly lush. Despite the missing Blue Monday single, this CD is still highly recommended for newcomers to the ground-breaking band from Manchester. Play back to back with Movement and Substance!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As an adult that does a lot of reading of all genres and for book clubs this was a refreshing read!  I love how the author makes me feel like I am in this world she's created.  So often I can suspect what will happen next with other books but not this one. This was just a fantastic surprise page after page.  The characters are thought provoking as is the ever changing storyline.  Lastly, many books lose interest as I continue into the sequel for instance and this one does NOT, it's a wonderful read.  Literallly read it in one day, not because I had time on my hands but I couldn't put it down.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book of the series was just as wonderful as the prior two.  The author is extremely talented at making you feel like you are present in this story and makes you truly care about the fate of the character and the people of Panem.  If more authors could weave a story such as this I would never put my kindle down!  As a busy working mom this was a delight to just escape into a story that was surprise after suprise whether it be sad or joyful.  Lastly, the ending did not disappoint which so often happens with other books, thank you Suzanne Collins!
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I am not using this device for its intended purpose.  It is a headphone amp.  I use it as an amp for a Sony Xplod boom box.  I have a Creative Zen mp3 player.  In order to listen to it through my boom box, and have a decent level of volume, the Creative Zen volume had to be cranked up about 3 below max.  With this device I am able to have the same level of volume but turn the Zen down to a bit above the middle volume level.  This seems to make my mp3 battery last longer.  It also gives a light bass boost to the songs, making them sound just slightly deeper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an amazing story that this author creates for us!  I didn't know what to expect from this book and was pleasantly surprised that the entire book surprised me.  As an avid reader many books can begin to take the same turn of events and themes, but this was refreshing.  The author does a wonderful job at making you feel part of what is happening and care for the charactors and the greater themes.  Once I finished this book I couldn't wait to jump into the next!
B001BNFR6W|3.0|Several of the disks don't play well.  They skip, freeze or just won't play.  I'm thinking of returning the whole set.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|\\"Come See About Me\\", the opening track from Tedeschi Trucks Bands' album 'Revelator', reaches out and grabs you, letting you know right off the bat that this disc is going to rock, southern style. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi are probably one of the world's most talented musical couples, so excellence is no surprise.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, Tedeschi Trucks Band formed in 2010 and primarily features members from Tedeschi and Trucks' respective solo groups, but creates original songs separate from either of the solo bands. The mixes here are all super-lush, and from a studio perspective must have been a blast to create. Of course there are fabulous guitars and lead vocals, but the rhythm section, piano, organ, horns, and background vocals are also stellar. There are 11 musicians featured on the album cover, so this is no small time operation.<br /><br />There does seem to be a lot of mid-tempo tracks on the album - too many - and while it doesn't take away from its overall enjoyment factor, there's part of you secretly hoping they will kick the tempo up a notch. Which they finally do on \\"Learn How To Love\\" and \\"Love Has Something Else To Say\\", two of the best and hardest-rocking songs on the album.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I happened to hear their song \\"Little Lion Man\\" a few weeks ago.  I couldn't get the song out of my head, it was so different from what they usually play on the radio, wonderfully different.  I looked it up on the internet, found out they've been getting a lot of attention lately and rightly so.  I sampled a few of the other songs on the album here on amazon and decided to order.  The CD couldn't get to me fast enough!    At first I listened to the two songs that drew me to the band, \\"Little Lion Man\\" and \\"The Cave\\".  I love the banjo in \\"Little Lion Man\\", I just can't get enough of it.  I've listen to the CD backwards and forwards now, and I can sit a let it run through the entire gambit without shuffling through a single song.  I really love \\"White Blank Page\\" and \\"Dust Bowl Dance\\".  Each song has something to offer, really.    I'm so impressed with these guys, addicted to them actually.  Addicted to their sound, their lyrics, to the fact they play multiple instruments and play them well.  I can't say enough good things about this group and I can't wait until they put out more.  Do yourself a favor and add them to your collection.

B0042JIL2E|5.0|Imelda May is starting to get some serious recognition, and with her latest album \\"Mayhem\\", it's easy to see why. The Dublin, Ireland native continues her exuberant Rockabilly/Pop stylings on the album and with great results.<br /><br />The album has a definitive live feel and her band including outstanding guitarist Darrel Higham (also her husband) is dead on. Throughout, Higham's biting lead breaks and 50's riffs accent the songs with perfection. There is a also something of a slight Punk edge to the songs giving it that Alternative Rock vibe even though for the most part it's played straight.<br /><br />Right from the opener \\"Pulling The Rug\\", the listener is sucked in, as the spirited track combines old school Rock N' Roll and Rockabilly with wicked guitar playing, upright bass, popping drums and percussive shakes. Of course without May's vocals it wouldn't matter, but oh, how it does. She brings class, fun and sex appeal into the equation and never overdoes it. Everything sounds natural and sincere. The twang of \\"Psycho\\", the raucous Rockabilly of \\"Mayhem\\" (with some charged-up horns), the kicking \\"Inside Out\\" (with wailing muted trumpet) and the explosive \\"Let Me Out\\" are all fantastic.<br /><br />It's not all rockin' though as slower numbers like \\"Kentish Town Waltz\\", the folksy shuffle \\"Proud And Humble\\" and the mid-tempo watery sounding \\"Bury My Troubles\\" all show diversity. The mournful \\"Too Sad To Cry\\" which opens with a military-drum intro is also first class. A few tunes soak up a tad of Country such as \\"Eternity\\" and \\"I'm Alive\\" with the latter also featuring a bit of Jazz and some great pedal-steel guitar.<br /><br />A cover of Gloria Jones's (but better known as Soft Cell's monster hit version) \\"Tainted Love\\" is turned Rockabilly predictably and \\"Johnny Got A Boom Boom\\" will make one shake their butt proudly. May produced the album with help from Andy Wright and Gavin Goldberg and the sound is impeccable with a truly vibrant mix capturing the live sound.<br /><br />\\"Mayhem\\" is an outstanding release from an already accomplished artist who hopefully has plenty more to offer. Having recently recorded a live album with guitar legend Jeff Beck (and also playing with Beck at the Grammys) and making numerous TV appearances, May is certain to keep bringing plenty of \\"Mayhem\\".ding release from an already accomplished artist who hopefully has plenty more to offer.

068987474X|3.0|I think there is a great deal of good common sense advice in this book.  Its a good read and interesting to listen to the \\"case studies\\".  However to every rule there are exceptions.  And to be honest Greg, as insightful as he may seem, is not the only guy in the world.  I offer myself as case in point.  I had been divorced for almost six years when I met the man who is now my second husband.  He is one of the kindest men I've ever met but he has never been married.  He was 40 when we first met.  In his past he had put forth the effort of trying to meet women and even spent a large amount of years in his 20s pining away for a woman who only wanted to be his friend.  He decided at some point after that...if women wanted him they would find him.  Well I found him.  I asked him out first.  To be fair to Greg's philosophy, there was a bit of a \\"situation\\" that stemmed from me asking my future husband out first.  He told me he needed to think about it.      I should clarify...my husband is German and a man.  So if there was ever an enigmatic group of men on planet earth it would be Germans.  In any case when an American girl hears the words \\"let me think about it\\" that means no.     Let me tell you I'm of the very old school that if guys like you they will ask you out.  If they don't they don't.  But after finally getting the courage to ask him out and him telling me \\"let me think about it\\" my heart sunk into my socks.      So I forgot about it and made it a point to avoid him.  Well he saw me two weeks later and shouted in front of a room full of people \\"Hey there you are I've been looking for you\\"  So to be honest Greg is right but there are exceptions.      When he said \\"Ive been looking for you\\", my heart was filled with joy.  We made plans for our first date which was just coffee.  I thought ok maybe this will last ten mins maybe it will last an hour.  We talked for four hours.  I even left big lapses in our conversation so he could say ok...well I gotta go now.  Henever did.  And when the date was finally over he asked me out again and weve been together ever since.  So to be honest in my case Greg was right and wrong at the same time.  If I had left it up to my then prospect now husband make the first move we would have never gotten together.  And let me also add this is the BEST relationship Ive ever been in in my life.  We talk about whatever bothers us.  We are very friendly with each other and enjoy each others company.   We think alike on most issues.  We are very happy to be around each other and we are always laughing.  We truly are a match made if not in heaven then a really great place next to that.  Yes we argue...rarely but for the most part we just laugh and have a good time and lots of kissing LOL.  I wish everyone out there could have as great a relationship as I have with my husband.        UPDATE...we are filing for divorce.          JUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUST kidding.  We'll be happy together for the rest of our lives.  I'm so lucky or as my husband would say...we're so lucky.  We truly fit.

B0045ODPKY|2.0|Angelina Jolie plays the lead character in \\"Salt\\" ss a steroidal-driven CIA agent that mimics a Russian double agent intent on starting World War III. It takes a while to figure this out and you get to see Angelina go through scores of physical gyrations and stunts unlike anything her other cartoon character, Laura Kroft, ever achieved. For instance, at various times in this chase-filled film, Jolie:<br /><br />-- Scales skinny window sills of a high rise D.C. apartment building with her dog in the backpack -- in her bare feet.<br />-- Escapes capture by jumping from a freeway overpass onto a semi truck moving at freeway speed.<br />-- Jumps from that semi to a similarly haulin' gasoline tanker with a skinny grated deck.<br />-- Jumps to another vehicle moving at highway speed and hangs onto the edge by one hand before righting herself.<br /><br />All this without a scratch or without mussing her makeup or hair. Later on:<br /><br />-- She takes on at least 50 CIA agents in several combat scenes, without nary a scratch.<br />-- In purusit of the U.S. president, she repeatedly jumps downward in an elevator shaft, 3-4 floors at a time, always landing perfectly on little triangular steel ledges.<br />-- She survives and walks away from a car crash when the vehicle goes off the edge of a freeway, plummets 20-30 feet, and lands atop a bunch of other vehicles.<br /><br />She walks away from all this without a scratch. Oh yes, one time she cut herself. Later on, she destroys the funeral of the vice-president to the chagrin of 500 security agents and, to top that, saves the world from nuclear annihilation. If none of this is enough for you, in the final scene she takes a dive from a moving helicopter into a freezing ocean without a parachute or even her shirt, makes it to shore, then runs off into a fade to black screen, apparently setting the scene for \\"Salt II: The Return of Wonder Woman.\\"<br /><br />To say this film defeats the concept of suspended disbelief is like saying the Hindenburg had a little accident. Whatever the merits of the film's story, acting, scenery and script, nothing can overcome its excessive, ridiculous and utterly laughable action sequences. No one can possibly believe, for one moment, that anything in this very high budget film could ever really have taken place.of the film's story, acting, scenery and script, nothing can overcome its excessive, ridiculous and utterly laughable action sequences.

Each of the 11 tracks are rich in lyrical detail and musically, the band use a mixture of rhythms and atmospheres with the guitars drenched in 60's style reverb and jangling as they should.<br /><br />Right from the opener \\"She's Thunderstorms\\" the band connect in a huge way as the song opens with mysterious open guitar notes followed by the chords that just make perfect sense. Alex Turner's vocals remain as intriguing as always and they are truly on the money on \\"She's Thunderstorms\\". Thought the song is anything but mellow, there is a certain feel to it that is hard to describe where the mellower moments sit comfortably with the harder hitting chorus. A few other songs share sonic similarities to \\"She's Thunderstorms\\", but not musically. There's really no repetition here and that is a great accomplishment. And the guitar work by Turner and Jamie Cook is always seductive and appealing.<br /><br />Melodic gems include the fantastic \\"Black Treacle\\" which also features several killer lines lyrically including, \\"And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabriolet, One of those games you're going to lose, But you want to play it just in case\\". The song is rich in both verse and chorus and the guitar lines throughout are brilliantly executed. \\"Piledriver Waltz\\", the ultra-catchy \\"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" and \\"That's Where You're Wrong\\" all stellar in this respect. \\"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" is irresistible with its chorus, but the grooves during the verses are only setting the listener up for the dreamy chorus. And again, the guitar leaves weave genius in and out at all times. And, who could come up with a line like, \\"I took the batteries out of my mysticism and put them in my thinking cap\\"???.<br /><br />A few tracks crank up the volume, as in the lead single/video \\"Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\\" and \\"Brick By Brick\\" which echoes some Iggy Pop-styled Garage Rock (and Iggy did have a title by that name - a tribute perhaps?) and takes no prisoners, although it does feature a bizarre, sluggish tempo change at one point. The crazed rhythms of \\"Library Pictures\\" features stunning drumming by Matt Helders and bass work from Nick O' Malley, who achieves a fat groove on all tracks. \\"Library Pictures\\" is a great hotel room-trashing song, if bands do that anymore, but much like \\"Brick By Brick\\" there is a weird tempo change midway through.\\"All My Own Stunts\\" drives hard and features some excellent chord choices and Turner's vocals are outstanding here.<br /><br />\\"Reckless Serenade\\" and the shockingly beautiful \\"Suck It And See\\" continue the winning streak. If you can make a song with a title like \\"Suck It And See\\" melodically pretty, you've got some serious talent. And Turner really comes up with a great line when he sings \\"I poured my aching heart into a pop song, I couldn't get the hang of poetry\\" over top the gorgeous, almost Country-like musical theme. Beck would approve. Only the so-so \\"Love Is A Laserquest\\" falls short of true excellence. Turner's finest lyrics yet make Suck It And See one of the best albums of the year and this truly unique, talented band's career.t Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair\\" and \\"Brick By Brick\\" which echoes some Iggy Pop-styled Garage Rock (and Iggy did have a title by that name - a tribute perhaps?) and takes no prisoners, although it does feature a bizarre, sluggish tempo change at one point.

B004Y1USV2|2.0|Nice pop album. No Yes trademark to be found here (some chorus harmonies and a few typical Howe licks...but that's about it). Finally i can give my Mom a Yes album she will enjoy.
B000AYQJJ2|4.0|The rating I give here in purely arbitrary.  This is not really a review since I haven't had the opportunity to see this DVD set, but...where were John & Paul while this great gathering of musicians was taking place???  I do not mean to belittle either man here; I love both men in my own way.  Their gift of music to our culture is timeless.  Perhaps they felt they had done enough for world peace, I don't know.  But at this time, it seems to me they were mainly squabbling amongst each other in their solo efforts, trying to outdo the other and make more money for themselves, whilst George put his neck on the line to try to make a genuine difference in the world.  Can you imagine if ALL 4 BEATLES were gathered on stage for such a concert???  The proceeds could easily have turned Bangladesh into Las Vegas after just one show....and maybe wiped out hunger worldwide.  Like John said...IMAGINE!!!

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|This movie is horrible. No chemistry between the actors, no relationship built between you and the characters, the story is half told, half missing and totally incomplete. Unless you've read the book then you don't fully understand the relationships between the characters. Why did they bother with this version. It's useless. I love Michael Fassbender but that's not enough to like this version. I hated it. this is not Jane Eyre as Bronte would have wanted it told. this is some bored individuals interpretation of what they thought the story was about. The writer, producer, director and actors appear to have never read the story.

B004WKOCP8|4.0|Almost every band has had at least one album that polarizes the fan base during their career. The one album (or, if it's an artist with a very long career it might be a few albums) that gets debated about for years with those who will tear it to shreds claiming that is a pile of garbage and should never be listened to, and those who will defend it to the end, claiming that an artist needs to grow and try new things and not remain predictable or stagnant during a lengthy career.<br /><br />We have such a case with the latest Incubus effort \\"If Not Now, When?\\", an album that has certainly got the fanbase talking. \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is the band's first studio album in 5 years and there are those who say it should've been another 5 years before it was released, if ever. It's always a tough call for an artist once they've established a sound and a career. An artist never wants to be pigeonholed, but to veer too far away from what they are best known far can be career suicide. There are those who have done so with great success, but there are far more examples of failure with such a maneuver.<br /><br />Have Incubus committed career suicide with \\"If Not Now, When?\\" Have they decided to become a sad incarnate of the dreadful Maroon 5 or Matchbox 20? I say no. Although at least half of the fans are crying treason, this is a very thoughtful, melodic, beautifully constructed piece of art. \\"If Not Now, When?\\" kicks things off in sterling fashion. Sure, it doesn't remotely rock and inches very closely to Adult Contemporary, but it is a stunningly ethereal song awash in sublime melodies and Brandon Boyd's vocals soar to the heavens. The slight guitar and keyboard textures add to the beauty as do the lyrics. If this was a mere sellout, it wouldn't have been so carefully constructed, nor would Boyd sing with such passion. When he states, \\"I have waited all my life, If not now, when will I? Stand up and face the bright light, Don't hide your eyes, it's time\\" how can the listener not be swept away?.<br /><br />The mellow sounds continue with tracks such as \\"Promises, Promises\\", \\"Isadore\\", \\"Thieves\\", \\"Friends And Lovers\\" and the closer \\"Tomorrow's Fool\\" which has some great vocal harmonies and a bit of a Pink Floyd feel. \\"The Original\\" is another largely mellow song but takes a surprisingly heavy, Progressive Rock turn around the 3 and a half minute mark. Most impressive is the nearly 8 minute long epic \\"In The Company Of Wolves\\" which is also fairly Progressive, slowly building to a long crescendo with fuzzy guitars, eerie atmospherics, distorted vocals, electric piano and fat rhythms after starting rather generic for the first 4 minutes or so.<br /><br />So, does anything sound remotely like vintage Incubus? Well, \\"Switchblade\\" gets kind of funky with impressive bass and drum work, and lead single \\"Adolescents\\" pretty much rocks and has solid guitar work. (No wonder this was chosen as lead single, as perhaps label panic made this an obvious choice to mislead the public). There's no DJ-ing, no Hip Hop and no Nu Metal. It's up to the listener to decide if Incubus have grown or lost their minds, but \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is one of the year's most pleasant surprises.?.

B0045ZAQSM|5.0|This is a German production, with English subtitles. The star is Adam Bousdoukos, who masterfully portrays Zinos Kazantsakis, owner of the Soul Kitchen Restaurant in Hamburg. When the film opens, the Soul Kitchen's menu is simple and features things like fish steaks with French fries. The sound system blares soul music. (The soundtrack is excellent.)  There seems to be a small, but loyal, customer base of working-class folk who like cold beer.  The building is old and poorly maintained. We get the impression that the Soul Kitchen is doing little more than scraping along.    Zinos is an honest man, a loyal man, straightforward in the way he handles people.  His instinct is to trust others. Too bad that some of the people close to him don't share these qualities. His brother is a problem (big problem) gambler. His beautiful girlfriend leaves him for a job assignment in China.  He hires a chef (a chef in this joint?) who has an explosive temper and turns out haute cuisine that drives away faithful customers.      I don't want to say more about the plot, but the big question becomes: Can Zinos handle all that life throws at him? Life throws all kinds of stuff at him. There's a lot more than what I hint at above.    This production is often tagged as a comedy. But I did not laugh much at all.     Watch it and see how funny you think it is.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Two Brits make their annual pilgrimage to Comic-Con Conference in LA.  After the conference they rent an RV to visit famous UFO sites ending the trip with a visit to Area 51 in Nevada.  On the way they have an accident and meet Paul, the alien.<br /><br />The movie is very funny, but predictable.  Also beware, this movie is not for children, there is a lot of foul language in it.  Some of the scenes, like resurrecting the bird and promptly eating it up, will not resonate with them.  But for most adults, there is lot of humour.<br /><br />One group of people that might be offended is Christians, or people who take their religion seriously (literal interpretation of the bible).  Yes, this movie makes fun of them.  There are references to the stories in the bible, like resurrecting the dead, and curing the blind.  Paul flips out when he hears the fundamentalist girl's claim that the earth is only 4000 years old and lectures her about evolution.  At that point reality clashes with fiction.<br /><br />I liked this movie, but of course it is not for everyone.
0545259088|5.0|At one point in FOREVER, Maggie Stiefvater's wrap-up to her bestselling Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, Cole St. Clair --- the troubled but ultimately pragmatic bad boy of the group --- says, \\"Sometimes I was just never sure there was supposed to be a happy ending.\\" Indeed, at several points in FOREVER, the kind of ending Stiefvater will leave readers with is very much in doubt. Given the series's complexity, emotional authenticity, and numerous twists and turns, no one would expect it to end with butterflies and songbirds --- unless they'd had their tiny innards ripped out of their chests by bloodthirsty wolves, of course. But, as will surprise no one who's read the first two books in this superb series, Stiefvater manages to pull together the trilogy in a way that is suspenseful but also true to the story and its characters.    At the novel's opening, all the characters are in crisis. Grace has undergone her first traumatic, dangerously unpredictable transformation into a wolf, and is more traumatized by her short-lived returns to human form --- at which point she becomes painfully aware of all that she's lost and still losing. When she's a wolf, of course, she's fully canine. Lacking language and memory, she's filled with pure sensation and unable to grieve.    Her boyfriend, Sam, who underwent a dangerous experimental procedure to become --- and stay --- human, is grieving enough for the both of them. Every day is full of uncertainty and increasing danger, as Grace's transformations become more erratic and the threat to all the wolves grows. Spearheading the effort is Isabel's father, Mr. Culpeper, who's enlisted powerful politicians and businesspeople to back his plans to shoot wolves with high-powered rifles from low-flying helicopters. Isabel fears for the lives of her friends, especially Cole, who's currently in human form. But no one appears safe from this new human threat, not to mention the danger posed by the increasingly psychotic wolf Shelby has become.As for Cole, he's enjoying (as much as he enjoys anything) pursuing the elusive cure that could just possibly save them all.    Tension mounts as perils seem to arise on every side, with no obvious or easy answer in sight. Ultimately, in a move that may generate either salvation or heartbreak, the friends try to find Sam's father figure, Beck, the one who may hold their last best chance for lasting peace.    Maggie Stiefvater's previous books about Mercy Falls have been both achingly romantic and unfailingly authentic, and FOREVER is no exception. To the end, she remains true to her characters and to the mythology she's created, which, as she indicates in an author's note, includes rendering the wolves' lifelike behavior, for better or for worse. The course of true love might run even more roughshod for werewolves, and the future for Grace and Sam, Isabel and Cole is far from certain at the novel's close. But at least there's hope, and a satisfying conclusion for Stiefvater's many fans.        --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I've watched this movie so many times. At first, I was put off by Portman's British accent but I quickly got over that and into this fantastic film. You'll love it so much, you'll want to own it: trust me. From the gigantic, literally explosive scenes to the quite on-the-run scenes, this movie never fails to deliver. Aside from Natalie Portman's stunning performance, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Fry give equally charismatic, unforgettable performances.
0399215980|2.0|I ordered a hardcover copy of this title as a baby gift to go with an Eric Carle stuffed elephant.  I love the story, but was very disappointed in the size of the book.  It was approximately 3\\"x5\\".  I didn't think I had to ask about the size of a hardcover book.  I just assumed it would be much larger.  Couldn't get in touch with anyone at Amazon to see if there were larger sized books available. If I had known it would be so small, I would have at least purchased a board book which is easier for a baby to handle.

0439023521|5.0|I just got done reading this book and I must say I could not put it down. It is hard to find anything original nowadays with books, movies and what not, but it was refreshing to have something brand spanking new to sink my teeth into.    I think Katniss is a brave soul. She displays courage and loyalty in the face of danger. She is protective of all those she loves and this part of her character shines through several times in the book.    I encourage anyone who loves SciFi whether you are young, or just young at heart, to take a gander at a great book by a great author! I look forward to the next installment in this trilogy! 
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|It is basically a ten hour movie that moves, I loved it.  I can sit down and watch all ten episodes back to back and stay riveted to the TV the whole ten hours.  I can't say that about the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.  This is ten times better than that.  I hope the quality continues on this show, this first season is off the charts amazing.  I can't say enough of the photograpy, the acting, the cast, the story, and the plot twists. This is just an instant classic.<br /><br />The show is almost 100% faithful to the 1st book in the 'A song of Ice and Fire' series and that is a very good thing.  The changes that were made do not affect the natural flow of the story and only serve to keep the show on point.  I cannot stress this enough, I have never EVER seen a better production on TV before!!!  This show is in a class of its own.  I am not the most Fantasy oriented person out there, but this show blew me away.  I hope that the DVDs include the extra stuff that was played on HBO like the 'making of game of thrones' etc.  Perhaps they will also throw in some added extras.  I cannot wait to get my hands on my copy of this show as I pre-ordered it as soon as it was posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I will make some updates on this review once I recieve my copy of the show.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|The book is a page turner that you don't want to put down or pull away from. It sucks you in, in an all encompassing way that's unforgettable. The film is something you want to run away from kicking and screaming. Another Hollywood disaster film based on an incredible book hoping to use the book as a launching pad to lure devoted fans of the book. Everyone from Scarlet Johansson to Natalie Portman to Eric Bana try to make due with the awful film but in the end, none of these fine actors can save this trainwreck of a poorly written adaptation.

B000005RFQ|2.0|This should have been a great album. Gillan and Sabbath together?! Count me in! C'mon, I was a huge Gillan era Deep Purple fan and Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was the first album I ever bought. I was psyched. But unfortunately this is a less than rewarding album for me for several reasons.<br />First off the production is horrible. The guitars are oddly unclear despite their heaviness and trebly quality. They should be huge but certain frequencies appear to be missing giving the sound an awful \\"scooped\\", flat sort of tone. The bass is either too loud or not loud enough depending on the song. This same flat tone problem with the guitars also pertains to the drums. They're reverbed in that awful mid '80s way, and to make matters worse Bill Ward doesn't sound like Bill Ward. None of his characteristic playing is in evidence which makes him sound generic. In fact little of what made Black Sabbath great is apparent. Though Iommi has some nice solos, there is almost no groove or swing to most of the songs and, with a few exceptions, none of the headbanging riffs Tony is known for. Iommi dropped the ball with this one. There is no atmosphere either unless you count cheesy c-level horror movie evil or typical crotch level rock and roll as atmosphere. Most of this stuff is pretty unimaginative and little of it effects me emotionally. Born Again doesn't sound like previous Sabbath albums and while change can be good, this isn't. Black Sabbath don't seem to be innovating so much anymore, but instead are starting to imitate and losing in the process what I found interesting about them.<br />I'm afraid though the greatest fault lies with Gillan. While his vocals are fairly strong, he manages to cock it up by covering up some Iommi solos which idiotic vocalizations and his lyrics just don't fit. His awful odes to sex drugs and rock and roll such as Keep It Warm are completely out of place in Black Sabbath, and when he tries to get darker or more serious he's even worse. For example Digital Bitch is a song slagging a woman for partying too much, not caring enough and being able to afford her libertine lifestyle because her daddy made it rich in computers, so what? Sounds like jealousy to me. It manages to be juvenile, mean spirited, pointless and repetitive all at once. Now there are a couple of good songs such as the thrashing opener Trashed and Zero The Hero, but for the most part Gillan and Black Sabbath are as good a combination as mayonnaise and ice cream. And the cover stinks on ice.xample Digital Bitch is a song slagging a woman for partying too much, not caring enough and being able to afford her libertine lifestyle because her daddy made it rich in computers, so what?

B0037AGASG|1.0|OMG. This is unbelievable stuff.    This music is so bad it's a herald of the impending apocalypse, and a clear sign of the decline of western civilization - or whatever is left of it.    Parents, do your kids a favor: Don't buy them this garbage, even if they ask for it.    Instead, buy them The Best of the Jackson Five: that Motown sound is catchy, tuneful, upbeat, well-played, and little Michael and his brothers can really sing.  It's great for kids and will help them develop better taste in pop music.    And then you won't have to listen to nauseating nonsense like this.

0312600844|2.0|I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about this book. This is the first book I've ever read by Franzen and although, for the most part, I enjoyed his prose, I absolutely HATED his characters. They were all miserable people doing miserable things to one another. Occasionally I would find myself becoming sympathetic towards a character only to then have them do something so awful that I would find myself loathing them again. Call me old fashioned, but I have a hard time enjoying a book when I can't care about or root for at least one character. I will admit that Franzen turns it around a bit in the end. The last 80 pages or so I was finally compelled to FEEL for some of the characters and that was my favorite part of the book! If some of those good feelings could have been sprinkled throughout the other 500 pages of this tome I think I would have enjoyed it more. But overall this was a trying read for me. Some friends of mine have read this and absolutely loved it and they loved it for the exact same reason that I didn't. Maybe I'm just too positive and sunny of a person to allow myself to wallow in the miserableness for 500+ pages. Not that I'm trying to call my friends negative...oh geez, all this is just coming out wrong now...<br /><br />Here's the gist:<br /><br />- I enjoyed Franzen's evocative and painterly writing.<br />- I enjoyed the pop culture references which helped me feel like this story was truly of today's world, that these characters could actually be real.<br />- I didn't quite understand the passages that were supposed to be written as autobiography by the Patty character. Patty's autobiographical voice didn't seem any different from Franzen's voice, so that device didn't work for me.<br />- I wish the characters had been a bit more sympathetic throughout the story. It was hard for me sometimes to push on through because they were all so miserable that I didn't even care what happened to them.<br />- I'm not sure I would ever read anything else by Mr. Franzen.y Mr. Franzen.

0316098329|4.0|Don't read this book if you have a heart condition.  No book has pumped this much adrenalin into my system since The Exorcist, and that was 30 years ago.  It struck me as a fictionalized version of the Jaycee Dugard story, but actually the author was inspired by a different true story.  Five-year-old Jack has seen only two people, other than those on TV, in his entire life--his mother and her abductor, Old Nick.  Born in captivity, Jack has never been outside (the) Room, a heavily fortified shed in the maniac's backyard.   His mother has remarkably managed to make Jack's life seem normal, at least to him, while she becomes increasingly more desperate, especially after Old Nick cuts off their power for a few days.  This punishment reinforces for her the tightrope she walks between maintaining her sanity and making sure that Old Nick continues to provide them with the basics.  Jack, on the other hand, is quite content with his few toys, including one made from eggshells, and his few books, all of which he can now read and mostly recite from memory.  Jack is the reason that his mother perseveres, and one of  the things she misses most is dentistry, having let her teeth fall into ruin before Jack was born.  The prior neglect of her personal health is a telling indicator of just how vital a lifeline Jack has become for her.  This loving, symbiotic relationship is not as stifling as it may sound, and the mother's ingenuity in providing a full life for her son is nothing short of heroic.  Then one very harrowing event changes everything, but I won't spoil the suspense for you.  I will say that the second half is much less intense, and that was just fine with me.  I'd prefer not to stay revved up and sleepless like that for any longer than necessary.

B000INAXGU|3.0|So far I am lukewarm on Jamiroquai. He has a stellar sound and is definately not run of the mill. The problem is that this greatest hits suffers from the same thing as his studio albums; not enough 'good' material to justify an entire CD. There are 4 maybe 5 tracks out of 19 that are legitimate hits, and far to many slow ballady songs. I started to lose interest after 4 or 5 tracks. You know that you don't have a good CD when you put it in and begin to skip to certain tracks. But I am not complaining because I didn't pay a lot for it.
0316098329|4.0|Unique, unexpected, thrilling, sad, horrifying. These are the first five adjectives I thought of to describe this book. This is the fastest I've read a book in years, pretty much all of it in two sittings. It's completely original and propulsive and you just have to get to the end!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|After reading so many reviews about this book, I finally decided to pick it up. I really don't get the hype. The main character was essentially a \\"mary sue\\". Tragic past, she has to face trials, blah blah blah. Who cares really. The writing was basic and nothing to talk about.  I don't even understand why this book deserved sequels since I'm not interested in what happens next. Well I'm happy I didn't pick up all three books at one time or I would have been highly upset.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was fantastic, I finished it in less than three days. I read it off of my Kindle, and loved the bittersweet  book. It tells of hard times that many people would never hear of if not for this book. It's a real eye opener and just amazing and horrifying at the same time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who can handle many pages of sadness.

1453767533|5.0|I'm not sure why this novel is considered the \\"lesser\\" of the Austen novels.  It's brilliantly funny and contains wonderful satire of the gothic romance novels popular at the time and the silly games that suitors play with one another.  Through the character of Isabella Thorpe, Austen reveals the damages that can come from a deceptively manipulative friendship.  It is only when our heroine Catherine Morland becomes independent from Isabella's influence that she can realize that she wasn't a true friend at all.<br /><br />I have great affection for Catherine Morland.  It is true that she's the least intelligent of Austen's heroine's but that's because this is a true coming of age story.  We get to see her journey from naive young girl, to an independent young woman, through her profound life experiences.  And Henry Tilney is a great hero because even when he is amused and befuddled by Catherine, he does everything he can to spare her feelings and lead her in a sensible direction.  Plus he's really funny.<br /><br />It has been years since I'd read this book and I forgot how many of Austen's best quotes come from it! Here are just a few:<br /><br />\\"But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way.\\"<br /><br />\\"Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\\"<br /><br />\\"I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\\"<br /><br />Catherine's thoughts on reading History:<br />\\"I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all - it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs - the chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other books.\\"<br /><br />And my all time favorite Austen quote, as spoke by the wonderful Henry Tilney:<br /><br />\\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid.\\"n other books.\\"     And my all time favorite Austen quote, as spoke by the wonderful Henry Tilney:    \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid.\\"
B004EPZ07U|2.0|I hate movies like this! they always try to make up some comedy to fit in the movie but it never flows, plus there was only like 8 minutes of ok action. When your a badass superhero you need action in the movie in which i dont see Ryan as an action actor, but the biggest thing that bothered me was that in the Justice League TV show the green lantern was black so that jst totally ruined the show for me.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Nice story and cleanly presented. Why anyone would have a problem with this girl's true life story is beyond me? The crew is a wonderful collection of fine actors and the story is beautifully told. Yes, she is a Christian and that fact is included in the movie but it is not shoved down anyone's throat. She is a blond and surfs. Those are as much a part of who she is as her faith is. It is her story, a true story. Get over the race and faith of the real person already. Too often people give up their dreams as problems occur. Here is an uplifting story of a young person dealing with their pain and loss successfully.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|A friend told me about this series repeatedly for a year and I finally broke down and read it. Then read the next book, then the next book... and the next! I absolutely love this series. P.C. Cast and her daughter have created rich(literally),spunky, snarky, and diverse characters that you form bonds with. The banter between characters is fresh and fun and I find their style of writing endearing.  I truly enjoy stories that transport you and you forget you are reading words on a page. Don't wait a year to read this series, you won't be disappointed.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I keep my DSLR in the pack with the 60mm macro lens attached most of the time. When I need to keep my 70-300 field lens on the camera, a quick rearranging of one padded insert enables me to do it. I also carry a good point-and-shoot in the pack for group photos, grandchildren, and scenery. I like the fact that the Amazon pack doesn't advertise itself as a camera bag.
0792106989|3.0|I saw pieces of this movie in the past, when flipping channels. I was impressed by Jimmy Stewart's characterization and finally wanted to see the entire movie. American classic, right? John Ford? Yes. I wanted to see it. I recorded it on my DVD from TCM and prepared to enjoy.    Unfortunately, once we are into the picture itself, I find that Jimmy Stewart is too old to play the young lawyer---convincingly or otherwise. He's fine as the aging senator, but he just doesn't make sense in the core role, which is the heart of the movie. John Wayne is his usual Stock Manly Self (this movie did NOT need John Wayne in it---a good character actor would've done just as well), and he uses that expression \\"Pilgrim\\" in this one about ten times in the first 15 minutes. Sadly, hearing him say \\"Pilgrim\\" makes me view Wayne as a caricature here.    Lee Marvin is great to watch, at times, a real trip (anyone ever see that great old Dragnet episode he was in, from back in the early 50s?), but he is way tooooo evil for this part. It's overkill. A man with a silver whip?? This is almost comic relief. But it's not a comedy...    I think this is a Western that Ford made at the end of a played-out string. The story is compelling but told in a way that holds no surprises. It's just, here's Jimmy Stewart, here's John Wayne, here's Andy Devine, here's the bully everybody hates and fears, here's the town and the dust and the stagecoach. In a black-and-white wrapper, without any real tension in it. (You can do a lot with black-and-white; Ford just didn't do it here!)    You may enjoy it for many reasons, but the potentially enjoyable aspects were ruined for me because it was so inadequately done. I guess I've seen too many Westerns by now (I'm 52). I found it all kinda silly, but mainly because IT WASN'T WELL DONE. Ford could've done better---a whole lot better, with less clutter. We all know he had it in him.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Finally after a decade YES graces us with yet another album. It's nice being a YES fan because they've managed to stay together is some format since 1968.<br /><br />This album really grows on you. You've got the classic core of musicians, Squire, Howe, and White, with Geoff Downes, and Benoit David adding the keys and vocals. The comparison to the Drama album is unavoidable but the two are strikingly different. Drama was all about energy and virtuosity, Fly From Here is all about organic composition and refined musicality. This is a very satisfying work with great music and good lyrics. I, like everybody else, miss Jon Anderson's impenetrable lyrics that helped to define the YES body of work, but I'll say that these lyrics are different; not worse just different.<br /><br />If you're a fan, buy it. Period.
0312370849|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter, couldn't stop reading, finished in two days, One of the best books ever read
0307279189|5.0|I am a basic runner, but this book so motivated me that I have really stepped up my game.  Now I can't wait to get out of bed each day and hit the streets.  The best part is the science at the end.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|I have a brother that is gay and I wanted to be more in tune to the mindset of this althernate way of life.  I was hoping this book would help but I dont feel that it really did too much for me in that respect.  Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film first and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde.  would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|What more can you say than that this is the best, most masterfully executed translation of the classic noir genre into any other period?     The script is breathtakingly smooth in its fully and unapologetically stylized manner. The characters play their characters gorgeously, and the few moments where the noir facade is broken to point out that these are, theoretically, teenagers (when the mob boss' mother serves the protagonist a glass of milk before they get down to talking the business of drugs, crime, and espionage) work wonderfully to complement the mood.    To make it perfectly clear: this is not a movie attempting to be in any way realistic. It is completely and utterly stylized. Perhaps best compared with Rian Johnson's other film, Brothers Bloom, which is introduced by a sequence describing the brothers' childhood and beginning as con men in a kind of tall tale/folk tale rhyme. Each film lives in a world which follows very different rules than our own, but a world which is constructed with incredible skill and delicacy.    Brick is entirely self-aware, and it weaves a deliciously dark tale of treachery, crime, passion, manipulation, and tragic downfall all set among teenagers in an average Californian high school. A classic I'm sure I'll re-watch countless times as I make sure all my best friends have seen it.
048623231X|5.0|These are some awesome illustrations by Gustave Dore. There is so mucch detail in the engravings it's fascinating. And to think that someone could grasp so much detail and add their own imagination from Dante's writing is interesting. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has read or will read the Divine Comedy. I also recommend that you read the book first before taking a look at the illustrations. That way you can use your own imagination first to envision the narration before having Dore help you out a bit.
B0020TS5KQ|1.0|Purchased this blu-ray disc assuming it would have closed captions and it doesn't.  Not sure why it does not, maybe it cost less?  Amazon lists two blu-ray versions of Chocolat.  The other, older one states that it has closed captions.  I just ordered it as I need closed captions.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|Ana's last album was a change of pace, what with falling in love and having a baby -- it was a different kind of album.    Unconditional is a return to form -- a blues album with outstanding guitar work, great vocals, and a wonderful collection of guest artists (Sonny Landreth and John Cleary from New Orleans where the album was recorded), as well as Jason Ricci on harmonica.  Her songwriting is also excellent, as always.  Her originals are mixed with a few old blues songs she loves.  This album also showcases Ana's versatility.  The instrumental slide duel with Sonny Landreth, \\"Slideshow,\\" is a highlight.    Hopefully, this can be Ana Popovic's breakthrough album (they've all been excellent) in the U.S.  Ana should be playing stadiums in this country instead of small clubs.

1407109367|5.0|I don't want to give away any plot details, but this story is fantastic. Obviously you should be sure to read the books in order, but if you liked the Hunger Games or other stories like it, then you'll love Catching Fire. It's full of captivating plots and characters and the end will leave you wanting more.
1416955070|2.0|This book was reccomended by my two friends, so I eagerly awaited to read it.   Yes, I never fell asleep, and I did like the whole original \\"ShadowHunters\\" thing. The \\"seeing things regular people can't see\\" I didn't like because I felt like I had read it thousands of times. The only characters I felt were fully developed were Jace, Isabelle, Magnus, and maybe Simon. Clary I didn't like at all, she wasn't developed at all and I couldn't come up with any character traits. She was just another version of \\"I don't think I'm pretty yet two boys throw themselves at me\\" type of girl and might as well screamed \\"JACE!!! HELP ME!\\" throughout the book. I did like her artist side, but Cassandra Clare didn't go into a lot of detail about that.   The Jace/Clary love story was terrible. It was one of those \\"I saw you and fell in love with you\\" relationships, and even though this book is fiction those types of relationships are so unreal and I never would use it in one of my stories. (I'm a writer). In one part of the series, Jace tells Clary, \\"When I saw you sitting with Simon I wanted to be sitting with you instead\\" or something like that.   I'm not usually the negative-comments-type of person, but sorry, this book deserved it.
B0040I6CPU|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford follows the lives of the inhabitants of the poor, sleepy hamlet of Lark Rise and the more affluent and snooty inhabitants of Candleford during the last decades of the 19th century (sometime in the 1880s I believe). The central character Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) is a young girl from Lark Rise who is sent by her parents to work as an assistant to the postmistress, the capable and sensible Dorcas Lane (a brilliant Julia Sawalha). Initially Laura balks at the more restrained and formal way of life in Candleford, and is humiliated by the way some of the town's more snobbish inhabitants (such as the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby, credibly portrayed by Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton) look down upon her, but she gradually finds satisfaction and a measure of happiness in her job and new surroundings, and comes to develop a true understanding of the inhabitants of both Lark Rise and Candleford, in all their complexities. Julia Sawalha is amazing in her role as the kind postmistress who acts as a sort of mentor to young Laura, and whose own life seems deceptively straightforward, despite some undercurrents, brought on by her close friendship with town squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to a city girl,the cool and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).<br /><br />To delve too much into the plot would detract from the viewer's pleasure, and so all I will say is that this excellent series has everything to recommend it - a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography of the lush English countryside, and plenty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor.The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end. Luckily for fans, there is Lark Rise to Candleford, Seasons 2-4.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro in the same film? That got my interest. And a premise about a human with limitless abilities? Also intriguing, though I worried it would turn into a spinoff of the recent flood of superhero movies. Instead, \\"Limitless\\" is more down-to-earth and more layered.<br /><br />Cooper's character is an author with a book contract, but no ability or discipline to focus that talent. He is losing sleep, relationships, and peace. When he bumps into his former brother-in-law on the streets of New York, that all changes. He is introduced to a new drug, and soon he is flying high on the new energy and focus it gives him, allowing him to access the full potential of brain--but at a cost. If he stops taking the drug, he gets sick and discovers that even death could result. More immediately, though, there are others after this illegal substance and the effects it can produce.<br /><br />Mixing stylistic elements of \\"Fight Club\\" and story elements of \\"Wall Street,\\" this movie spins off into its own interesting take on the limits of the human mind and its potential for danger. It also comes across as a veiled expose of the prescription drug industry. Don't get me wrong, though. \\"Limitless\\" is not a message movie, at least not overtly. Overall, it's a very entertaining, somewhat thought-provoking, and ultimately violent tale of the good and evil that await us in a society where access to all sorts of drugs becomes \\"Limitless.\\"
0439023521|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I have read in a long time. I love it, and you will too. Just be prepared to read all 3 of them straight through from beginning to ending because once you pick up this book you'll need to finish the entire trilogy. It's that captivating.

B004Y03LQ2|4.0|I was an Iron Maiden fan back in the 80s, but slowly lost interest in most metal music over the years. Recently I've gone back to my childhood metal roots and picked up some of the albums I loved along with others I could not afford at the time on my allowance.<br /><br />From Fear and Somewhere Back in Time were perfect for me. I didn't want to spend a bunch of bucks picking up all the albums and I was unsure if I would even like their 90s to present music because other bands like Metallica and Megadeth I stopped enjoying around this time (for me, the enter sandman sellout time.)<br /><br />Been listening to From Fear for about a week now and I'm loving it very close to as much as their earlier stuff. I know I am going to slowly pick up some of the albums represented by these cherry picked songs in hopes that they missed some gems.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was a bit weird is that the songs seem to be mixed around on the 2 cds (not in order of release date.) So when I hear a song I like, I have to keep refering to the booklet to figure out which album it is from.<br />Otherwise, feels good to be back :)

B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is a wonderful product.  It is well made and quality was given high consideration.  If you're looking for a unique experience in mobile gaming, then this product is for you.  A very good high quality fast LED screen that has superb picture clarity, brightness, and sharpness.  Also, a well made hard case that will absorb \\"bumps and bruises\\".  I assure you, your console is well protected.  Storage bags that \\"tie up\\" tight, to keep your accessories in, are placed on each side of your console.  Your console is securely strapped down tight, as to not move around inside the case.  Your console is also resting on a padded, and cushioned insert where it is well protected.  I've been dealing in gaming products and have been a gamer since the Atari 2600 came out in the seventy's, and I've not seen better quality than this.  As with all mass produced items, occasionally one may get through the production process with some \\"defects\\".  But one thing that I have PERSONALLY found out about this company (Gaems), is that it stands behind, and cares about their product!  I had an issue with mine, and the co-founder, and owner, John Smith personally called me himself and COMPLETELY worked it out with me!  You can't go wrong with this product when the company is standing behind it like that!  I fully and completely recommend this product!  By the way...the two owners of \\"Gaems\\" are DEDICATED gamers such as myself, and care for this product that they've developed.  That is hard to find nowadays.
0765365278|5.0|Absolutely worth reading. Brandon Sanderson does have a masterful skill to create fantasy worlds from thin air, and surprisingly enough, with all that has been written in the genre, he's still able to give birth to something that feels new and fresh. Engaging, entertaining, definitely... awesome.
0446693804|3.0|...but I kinda like the movie better, and it wasn't super great or anything. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but after seeing the movie, I expected something really fantastic (the book version is always supposed to be way better than the movie version, right?), and I didn't get that from it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|What a great alarm. I can set several, I have to, and set a different tone for each. What a help to me. The format is clean and straightforward.

B004J4WKUQ|2.0|This book is basically a retrospective look at 80s pop culture, especially the early arcade video games -- Pac-Man, Joust, Adventure, all the great classics, plus some lesser-known gems. These cultural artifacts are described in tender detail, and the author's love for them practically shines through the pages. I enjoyed those aspects of the book a great deal.    Unfortunately, the book falls flat as an actual fictional narrative. The pacing is a bit awkward. There is virtually no character development, and the characters themselves are flat. The protagonist is one step away from being a Mary Sue (or a Marty Stu, rather), though he takes turns between performing heroic deeds and expositing at the reader. There's at least one instance of Deus Ex Machina which helps speed the characters through plot (such as it is). There is some foreshadowing that fizzles into predictable cliches. In the end, the world is saved after a suitably pyrotechnic boss battle, and all is well.     In fact, this book reads as though it was written by its protagonist: someone who is much more familiar with games than with people. If this book was a documentary, it may be excellent; as a fiction book, it is below average.
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One, Cline's first novel, is an incredibly journey through the future and past. Set in the mid 21st century, the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The greatest escape from reality is OASIS, a fully immersive, open-source, free VR game/environment. The creator of OASIS, Halliday, has decided to leave his massive fortune, and control of the company, to whoever can solve his huge, 80's geek/pop culture inspired \\"easter egg\\" hunt. Ready Player One follows impoverished Wade Watts as he tracks down the clues leading to the ultimate prize, trying to stay one step ahead of other competitors and IOI, a monolithic, moral-less corporation out take control of OASIS for its own goals.<br /><br />That's a brief description of the book's plot, but it doesn't do justice at all to the writing. There are hundreds of minor details, little bits of enthralling geek and 80's trivia that show the loving care Cline took while crafting this novel. There are many well executed minor plot elements and questions, such as what this fortune should be used for, whether OASIS should continue as such an addicting escape from a terrible reality, the proper level of commercialization in popular software, and more which I won't mention to avoid any spoilers; these all add to the complexity, richness, and flavor of the novel. Furthermore, Cline's managed to include all these elements in a way that shouldn't turn off those who aren't dyed-in-the-wool geeks, or aren't old enough to remember the beginnings of popular computing; although I'm a definite geek, I'm in my 20s, and while I've seen a lot of these old movies, I've never had to deal with cassettes and only barely remember floppies. I study Chemistry, not programming. Despite my geek-cred limitations, I really loved this book and think other readers will too.<br /><br />Overall, this is easily the best novel I've read that addresses the geek sub-culture, and one which I know I'll re-read again and again over the years. I'd recommend it to those interested in the development of nerd culture, as well as anyone looking for a great plot with awesome levels of detail and care in the novel's execution. I now look forward to Cline's next book with great anticipation, though I have no idea of how he'll top Ready Player One.interested in the development of nerd culture, as well as anyone looking for a great plot with awesome levels of detail and care in the novel's execution.

B00127RAJY|1.0|I used to work out every day but it's been a couple of years now, and now I'm up to 193 pounds so I needed to get in shape again.  I got this DVD because I love watching The Biggest Loser and always wished I could be on it. Boy I'm sorry I got this one. I don't expect any workout to be easy, but I couldn't get through even 10 minutes of this. She doesn't let you rest, even to get a sip of water. It's just waaaaaay beyond my level right now. I don't suggest this for beginners AT ALL. it's not that the routine is hard, you have basic squats, jumping jacks and pushups. It's just that physically I couldn't get through it. I'm going to keep at it because to be fair, how can you rate a workout when you haven't even done it all? And I do think it will help shred inches if only I could make it through it! Maybe I will be able to get a little farther tomorrow, and maybe eventually I will be able to get all the way through Level 1.
B0053B347M|3.0|When this light stripe is installed on my DELL U2410 24\\" display I don't even see the light on a back, it's that weak. Wall is approx 1 foot away from display which is supposed to be the perfect distance. Wall is pure white color. Product is very cheap, not worth returning it of course, but overall I am not satisfied with it at all. Also, wire is very long and therefore relatively heavy, the stripe was falling down all the time, I had to use additional tape to secure it at place. Also it's not white as described here, it's has a strong purple/blue tint, which is not eye friendly color (even though product is intended to reduce eyestrain)<br /><br />If you want a decent backlighting for your monitor, pass on this one and search for another. Very Very weak light.
0812550757|4.0|this is the kind of book which renders genre snobs, who value \\"literary novels\\" as the only legitimate kind of literature writing, stupid.  everything that makes a book great literature is present in the Ender series.  a science fiction book can find a way to include all of the great themes of mankind since the advent of writing (The Iliad and the the Odyssey, etc.).  This also happens to be a great science fiction genre book, and thank the goddess, it's not noticeably video game based.  it's allegory heavy, but not so heavy that it stops the action.  there is a lot here to think about long after you finish the book.
B000058983|5.0|Love Love Love Love Love this work of Art 'Forever Changes'.     Arthur Lee, Brilliant & Unique. Black man fronting an all white band.   Los Angeles was the scene. 1967. Sunset Strip. Peace and Love. Rich Hippies! Summer psychedelic at it's best!    The album continues to be one my top 10 of all times. (Up there with the very best)  Not a song on this Disc will disappoint.     A combination of Rock, Folk, Soul, Baroque and Funk...    This is just a beautiful selection of acoustic songs with some bass and drums, simplistic yet captivating.  Neil Young had hoped to produce this album but ran into other obligations at the time.      This is Arthur Lee's statement of redemption:  This is the time and life that I am living, and I'll face each day with a smile.  For the time that I have been given's such a little while, and the things that I must do consist of more than style...    This will be one of your best investments of a lifetime.   Treat your ears and your soul to Forever changes. You will be Forever changed.
0553801473|3.0|For starters, I wasn't one of the fans who waited six years for this book. I got into A Song of Ice and Fire (aSoIaF) in 2009 and read every book that year. I would say I didn't let the hype and anticipation get to me especially when A Feast For Crow (AFFC), in my opinion, was the weakest entry into the series. It was still good but the limited focus on the Lannister Twins and a slew of unimportant characters shrunk the world of aSoIaF and made the story feel more like a campy soap opera set in the middle ages. The cast of characters got too big and too spread out so it would seem Martin choose a divide and conquer style by devoting many chapters on a few characters as oppose to before when he would advance the plots of many characters all at once because they were clustered to gather in a handful of settings. I expect this trend to continue in the next book until all or most of the players are consolidated on Westeros. I don't have a qualm with this approach as long the characters are doing things that advances the story and that's just one of the problems with A Dance with Dragons (aDwD)<br /><br />The stars in aDwD are Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen (Dany), Tyrion Lannister and a few others I won't spoil. Martin knows readers were curious about them  were more than upset when such character favorites didn't make it in AFFC--read the post script by the author. Martin delivers on the sheer amount of devoted on Jon, Dany, and Tyrion at 14,10, and 12 chapters respectively. Fans rejoice, right? Not quite so. Let's consider Jon and Dany first then Tyrion.<br /><br />While Jon's chapter is not as thrilling as it was when wildings and wrights were crashing down on the Night Watch, it is still entertaining nonetheless as Jon tries his best to adjust to the leadership role thrust upon as Lord Commander. Jon's chapter are supposed to parallel Dany's chapter as they are two young people from great virtually extinct houses trying to lead a people. Comparisons end there for where Jon stumbles Dany flounders.<br /><br />To put it bluntly Dany's chapters are boring. It's almost like reading the same chapter 3 or 4 times. The Yunkish slavers test Dany, her council quarrel with each other on the best way to handle the Sons of the Harpy and the wise masters. Some advise brute force, other advise compromise if not outright submission. Dany chooses the less confrontational approach like taking hostages and hope for the best. The plan fails and we start again. She is provided with an \\"out\\" twice, that is leave Meereen for good and head to Westeros, she turns down both offers opting for the honorable route and fix the mess she's caused except she doesn't fix anything and her final recourse was a giant step backward in terms of her beliefs and efforts. Oddly enough, it is not until she is forcibly remove from Meereen that her subplot actually goes somewhere but that's towards the end of the book.<br /><br />Last we have Tyrion. While Jon and Dany have always been uncertain about things, Tyrion as always been a man of action, save a few incidents done in the heat of passion, Tyrion is a man of good sense too. Tyrion's chapter are somewhat of a chore to read. In other books he may pine after Tysha from time to time and have fits of self pity and self loathing, in aDwD it's all the time. He too gets sweep up in the plot restore House Targaryen and finds his way to Meereen to meet the Dragon Queen (Dany). His subplot gets derailed as soon as he gets within Meereen's borders. He looses a sense of himself and becomes complacent with being slave entertainment. He returns to his old schemes when he plans and exit strategy out Meereen. Meereen or what some fans call the Meereenese knot is just terrible for it seems to suck the life out of every character and bring plot advancement to a standstill. ADWD would have been a whole deal better if the chapters about the slave cities were shorter.<br /><br />Despite some of the misgivings I have about the main characters aDwD is a good read.Structurally it could do with some clean up with the syntax and horrid repetition in some parts. Some characters with lesser chapters were goog--the character arc for one of them was phenomenal. There is a point of view (or maybe two depending on taste) that book could have easily did without. In the world of aSoIaF there are two phases: buildup and execution. To the dismay of many fans out there aDwD is a buildup book. It starts more new threads than resolves issues brought forth from the previous book. However, words are wind. Pick up a copy and judge for yourself.cters aDwD is a good read.Structurally it could do with some clean up with the syntax and horrid repetition in some parts.

B0049JPU8A|5.0|I originally wanted to buy this album for just a few songs -- \\"For the First Time\\" and \\"This = Love\\" namely.  After listening to each track, however, I fell in love with nearly every song.  The lyrics are heartfelt and sometimes heart-breaking.  The style is smooth and easy to listen to at home, in the car, or even at parties for ambience.  Buying the album is definitely worth it (as opposed to buying individual mp3s), especially at a price like $9.99!

B000F39M9W|3.0|Hip and cool count for a lot in Hollywood culture, but there's not much glamour around classical music. Salonen took advantage of the opening of Walt Disney Hall to create excitement around L.A.'s formidable orchestra, and one tactic for bringing in the corwds was to boost Stravinsky's Rite of Spring into rock-concert status. It wasn't a desecration; the composer reveled in is own chic. For a while the LAPO actually had buzz in a city where classical concerts mostly draw older patrons from Pasadena. Salonen was already a cultural hero, and his dedication to modern music, as well as to embracing the larger community, offsets his lack of conviction in a wide range of standard repertoire, from Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven through Brahms, Wagner, and Bruckner - I don't think he's even touched the first two, certainly not on recordings. The orchestra's connection with DG, which began with this album, has solidified under Gustavo Dudamel, Salonen's successor, whose credentials in reaching the community are incontestable, and so an honorable legacy continues.<br /><br />As for the CD itself, the Mussorgsky Night on Bald Mountain, played in its original version, is fast-paced and energized but not warm or Russian. It's more like a night on a scary dissection table. In almost every way the original is inferior to Rimsky-Korsakov's brilliant rewrite (don't expect a repeat of Boris Godunov, where the composer's first two versions speak in is voice without Rimsky's smooth touch), and it takes more than Salonen offers to convince me otherwise. More disappointing is his lightweight, clinical reading of Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin Suite. Solti gave the score electro-shock treatment, and perhaps Salonen thought it was time for a little tenderness, softening the shock value and turning down the lurid spotlights. It's not possible to make this assaualtive score mild-mannered; I wish Salonen hadn't tried.<br /><br />The main attraction, however, is the Rite, which was broadcast on PBS and touted as a miracle in the impressive acoustics of the new Hall. (Walt Disney does have the remarkable trait of enveloping the listener in sound, the effect being startlingly like listening to a high-end stereo system - you are almost at the movies.) On this disc I heard neither the \\"perfection\\" of the lead review or the fatal defects that someone else complains about. The Rite of Spring has been an engineer's treat and audiophile showpiece for well over fifty years. DG's new version is in that lineage, yet it's a serious reading from Salonen, skillfully shaped, with rhythmic precision and every detail in place.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that my blood heated up listening to it, however. Dg's new hotshot Dudamle has since recorded a more dramatic, visceral account. If you refer to great Stravinsky conductors like Bernstein and Boulez on Sony, with magnificent playing from the NY Phil. and the Cleveland Orch. respectively, Salonen seems a little underwhelming, although he finds some very quiet, spooky patches to highlight in Part Two, and the orchestral playing is lean and precise, a trademark of the Salonen era. Ultimately, however, this reading suffers forrom a lack of character, something to make it stand out form the pack.S and touted as a miracle in the impressive acoustics of the new Hall.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was a good book.  But not a good end to this amazing, inventive trilogy that I invested so much of my heart into.  I was looking forward to this book to see how it all ended, of course, but also to see how Katniss reached maturity and what growth looked like for her.  Much as other reviewers have stated, I didn't get this and found myself extremely disappointed.      Even worse, the book is careening towards an end at a swift pace and then the climax falls apart and the ending seems to stumble towards a slapped together conclusion.  I didn't even realize the book was over until I saw the words epilogue.  And not in a good I-was-engrossed- sort of a way.  Rather, it was in a wonder-if-the-publisher-demanded-she-finish-so-she-slammed-an-ending-on kind of way.    Again, it was still a fun read but I resent the cheap quality of the ending.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't like fantasy or sci-fi at all and i was hooked on this series.  I was just going to give the first few chapters a shot since I heard this was a popular series, but figured it would be wasted money when I never finished the book.  How wrong I was!  This book was interesting and the details of the fantasy world woven so well that I didnt even know I was reading a fantasy novel because it all came together so naturally and believably.  HUGE recommendation!
B000ZBUY78|5.0|I purchased it for my mom, I did not wanted to buy a Quartz to keep her from hassel of chaning the batteries so I purchased this very low price self winding watch. NO need to change the batteries ever. Such watches are available for $5000 due to this feature but Seiko rocks. She already have a Seiko watch which she was using for more than 30 years and still it works like charm so I purchased it.    The only thing she didn't like about is the dial which is tooooo small and it doesn't look good on her fat writs. If you want to buy anything like this go for little bigger dial
1595141715|5.0|this book is so amazing. once i started reading it i couldnt put it down. it talks about real issues that are relatable and also without seeming to pushy, but still it makes you think about all the little things that you might say or do that you think are funny but this could affect someones life in the most negative way. everyone should read this.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to say, these books truly got under my skin. The story itself is riveting and the characters are flawed and human and very fleshed out. I read the trilogy in 4 1/2 days and I wish there was more. I'm actually sad that it's over. I can't stop thinking about it and I'm sure it will be something I re-read atleast twice.     Great for all ages and thoroughly entertaining and engaging. A MUST READ!!

By the time another Cars movie comes out,  my nephew will have moved on to something else.  Thank God.
0553801473|5.0|I will keep this review short to avoid potential spoilers.  Martin rewards the patience of his readers with this book-- there is a level of polish in this book far exceeds what you find in the other volumes of the series.  Where passages or events clearly were lovingly worked on (say, the river battle at King's Landing for example), most of the previous books did not maintain that level of storytelling for the entire narrative.  aDWD does.  If you've read and enjoyed Song of Ice and Fire to this point, you'll likely love this novel as well... for as long as it lasts (and it's a hefty tome, at least).<br /><br />Now we must begin the wait again...

All of the characters are awesome and I am so happy a happy ending was given to \\"Disney's The Little Mermaid\\"(Ariel)! In the original \\"The Little Mermaid\\" the story is very depressing and negative and the prince was a jerk. Disney's story on the other hand is upbeat and full of fun and Prince Eric is a WONDERFUL guy who is a GENTLEMAN and SWEETHEART. This movie holds many of my childhood memories and everytime I watch it I feel like my inner child comes out again. The special features are also awesome and VERY fun! I am VERY happy I bought this DVD!!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|People seem to really miss out on this movie but for me, it ranks as the 3rd best of the Indy films.  For some reason, the opening scene when we first see Jones pulled out of the trunk and questioned by the Russians, doesn't seem to work very well. He looks old there and the dialogue seems stilted.  But as soon as he throws the gun powder into the air and things start rolling, it's a fun ride.     I think the kid in the movie does a great job and is really convincing as he depicts the adventurous spirit of his father as well as the misgivings and rebelliousness of a son who grew up without a dad (or at least his real one). I've even read a comment or two from the actor, Shia (?), who admits to \\"dropping the ball\\" and letting people down by not bringing the character to life- I say nonsense.      Finally, for me the concept of the inter-dimensional beings is really cool and fits quite well with the subjects from other Indy movies such as the Holy Grail, Arc of the Covenant, in that it is partly based in truth.  Those other dimensions (I think 10 in total) have been proven to exist- and the beings, some say, are even mentioned in the Bible. Good enough for me.    I'm a big time Indiana Jones fan and I can see how some folks would be disappointed in this movie- especially with some of the computer animation- someone please put an end to all of that stuff! But in the end, I enjoyed it a great deal and have watched it several times.

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is among my absolute favorite books.  A fantastic story told in a very creative way, this book is worth a read by kids and adults alike.  The illustrations are magnificently done, the story unfolds through the words and pictures, and the plot is masterful.    I picked this book up as one of my children was reading it and I was curious about how a novel could be written largely using illustrations.  Page by page, I found that it can be done exceptionally effectively.  By doing so, it maintains the interest of young readers and captures the imagination of any reader.  If you haven't read this book yet, you should.  I promise it will not be a waste of your time.  If you don't own this book yet, you should.  I've found myself flipping through the pages every month or so and recalling the enjoyment of this story.
B003QI95Y0|5.0|Clutch released their eighth studio outing From Beale Street To Oblivion in 2007, an album which saw the band include a lot more of the blues influences which were slowly creeping into the band's overall sound.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Clutch play rock music sounding somewhere between stoner and classic rock with a curious mixture of loose jam-band vibes and ultra tight precision performances. This album in particular sees the band adopt a stronger blues influence as well, for an even more diverse mixture of styles.<br /><br />Singer Neil Falon has an amazing voice which helps him come across as a crazed gospel singer one minute, a ragged blues man the next and then a hard rock front man at a moment's notice. The man's eclectic appeal is one of the band's primary selling points.<br /><br />The lyrics are truly spectacular; some really unique observations are made, complex historical and political references sit beside surrealist imagery and large doses of humor all mixed together on each album and often within each song. As well as the vocals and lyrics; the individual musicians are incredible, from the astounding rock solid drummer J.P Gastor to the subtle and interesting bassist and guitarist Dan Maines and Tim Sult, both of whom are ridiculously talented individuals.<br /><br />Beale Street' is a strong and consistent album; opening up with that fast and powerful double-punch of 'You Can't Stop Progress,' and 'Power Player,' the album rarely lets up, and is one of the band's most instant releases. The music on the album is a lot more simple and direct than on previous albums, although the record keeps the inclusion of keyboards by Mick Schauer as well, which were introduced on the band's previous album.<br /><br />Highlights include the lyrically brilliant 'The Devil And Me,' the bluesy 'Electric Worry' (which features Eric Oblander of Five Horse Johnson on harmonica) and the gigantic album closer 'Mr. Shiny Cadillackness,' all of which are fantastic songs, on an already strong album.<br /><br />Overall, From Beale Street To Oblivion to is a great release from an excellent band and I'd highly recommend that you check it out, although with caveat that the band have strayed very far away from their earlier sound. If you don't like the blues influences and would prefer something more similar to the band's oldest albums, maybe reconsider. For everyone else who just wants some amazing rock music, make sure to get yourself a copy. Newer editions even feature a nine track live disc as bonus content, so what's not to like ?erall, From Beale Street To Oblivion to is a great release from an excellent band and I'd highly recommend that you check it out, although with caveat that the band have strayed very far away from their earlier sound.

B0000AUHPK|3.0|As near as I can tell, there have been at least 11 versions of this made for the screen. I have seen four, so don't know what the other 7 may hold. In any event, I thought this version was a bit slow moving. I felt the more recent version with Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley was better, as it held my interest more. Neither is quite true to the book,  but I feel that as long as the story is not radically changed from the book, it is not a problem. For those viewers and reviewers who have as their constant mantra \\"isn't like the book\\", I say: \\"then read the book\\". I actually expect film versions of books to be somewhat subject to the interpretations of the screenwriters and the director, and that gives me another perspective on them beyond my own. Back to the DVD at hand- 3 stars indicates \\"just OK\\" according to Amazon's guidelines, and that is what I would give this.

Some of the CD sounds a bit too somber for my taste. One really outstanding track on here, though, is Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini, simply a great piece of music, and probably worth owning the CD for.
1400032717|4.0|In the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, the author writes about a teenager named Christopher Boone, who shows signs of being autistic. It begins when he finds his neighbor's dog dead in her yard. Along his journey he learns some things he did not know about before. While reading the book, the reader learns about the way people can sometimes behave irrationally to protect someone they care about, and the lengths they go to.    Although no one will ever fully know or understand how an autistic child thinks, this book gives some small insight about how difficult it can be to take care of someone with that condition. Christopher's day is based on the simple fact of how many cars of a certain color he sees in a row on the way to school.  He doesn't like lies, has a hard time registering people's emotions, and can't really process simple things as quick as people without autism. Because of Christopher's attention to detail, it is very easy to imagine the setting and the people around him.  Along with Christopher's view, readers also get to see a bit about how it's like for people living with or taking care of autistic children. Christopher's father tries his best to make life easier for him all while dealing with the loss of his wife. You get to read about how difficult it can be; for example Christopher won't eat food of certain color and if they touch on the plate, won't eat it at all.   The story doesn't just tell about the difficulties of raising an autistic teenager or trying to find the murderer of a dog, but as you read, it gives a whole other story with some twists you did not expect. The surprises add more excitement to the story and will make you want to continue reading reading the novel until the very end to find out the truth.

Then I connected my portable GPS to my laptop and launched my navigation software and set it to COM port 3 as the port com default # is and it works instantly.   Good stuff and affordable.
B00122ORBI|5.0|I've always been a fan of Vangelis & purchased this (1492) and Alexander and Antactica, along with Weeping Meadow & some of Einaudi's works. Those 5 CD's played over & over for days, if not weeks!  I never tired of them & still don't! They were such a beautiful mixture! My absolute FAVORITE of all is Track 11-12, (on 1492) which flows into each other. The titles leave me puzzled, but I've not watched the movie yet.  I often play those two over & over at nite just before bed, with the lights dimmed. They leave me in such a peaceful mood. These 3 works of Vangelis just cannot be beat, as far as I'm concerned!
B004NDVJJG|5.0|Hersch, Fred.  Whirl. Palmetto Records. 2010<br />Fred Hersch, p; John H&eacute;bert, b; Eric Mcpherson, dr<br /><br />There seems to have emerged a broad synthesis or approach in modern jazz piano playing, not the avant garde edge playing of, say, Fred Van Hove or Marilyn Crispell, but mainstream modern, that is deeply rewarding to the listener. Pianists as diverse as Keith Jarrett and Paul Bley, Kenny Baron or Kenny Werner or Brad Mehldau improvise in this context with great fluency and inventiveness, and equally important, with great musicality. The elements of the synthesis are these: a foundation in bop harmonies with the incorporation of more modern harmonic elements (a touch of impressionism here, of modalism there), a pianistic approach to their instrument, and interplay with drums and bass that is reminiscent of but doesn't try to duplicate the shifting balance of harmonic and rhythmic responsibilities in the classic Bill Evans trio with Scott La Faro and Paul Motian.<br /><br />The difference is apparent upon comparison. Listen, for instance, to the two great last albums of John Lewis, Evolution and Evolution II (1999, 2001). Lewis was a master of subtly placed chords but his soloing, and much of his ensemble playing, is straight out bop style -single note and propulsive, though tempered in Lewis's case by his profound debt to Count Basie, as seen in the sparseness of Lewis's playing and his subtle placement of rhythmic accents across the pieces he plays.<br /><br />Two recent albums show the creative strength of the new post-bop but still basically bop piano synthesis.<br /><br />Fred Hersch is a talented and imaginative pianist who shines in almost every context. His recent album, Whirl, on which he is joined by talented drummer Eric McPherson and bassist John Hebert, shows his strengths to advantage. The program is intelligent and varied. There are two standards, \\"You're My Everything,\\" done between mid tempo and up, with killer drumming, and \\"When Your Lover Has Gone,\\" done slow and lush. There is a bolero written by Hersch, \\"Mandevilla.\\" The trio plays it like a traditional bolero -but still recognizably jazz--all the way through. I especially recommend a boppish single note piece entitled \\"Mrs. Parker of KC.\\" It was written by Hersch's teacher, the wonderfully talented and uncategorizable pianist-composer-teacher, Jaki Byard. This tune, and another entitled \\"Skipping,\\" are rhythmically the most interesting in the album. The title song, \\"Whirl,\\" Hersch dedicates to the great prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet, Suzanne Farrell. It is another of Hersch's trademark swirling melodies, with the drums boiling up and receding and then coming back in again like the waves in the ocean.<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly satisfactory album which validates Hersch's high reputation in modern jazz circles.<br /><br />Wasilewski, Marcin. Faithful. ECM. 2011<br />Marcin Wasilewski, p; Slawomir Kurkiewicz, b; Michal Miskiewicz, dr.<br /><br />This is my second album by the Wasilewski trio (he's issued three) and it is fully as good as the first, which is to say, superb. The trio members, who have played together since the very early 2000s when they backed their fellow Pole, trumpeter Tomasz Stanko, are almost empathic in the way they pick up on each other's music cues and play them back or counter them to accent the group sound. This is a very exciting group, as well as a musically sophisticated one.<br /><br />There is not one bad cut in this fine album but some stand out: the propulsive  \\"Night Train to You,\\" the trio's take on the seldom played standard, \\"The Ballad of the Sad Young Men,\\" the pensive \\"Oz Guiros\\" and \\"Woke Up in the Desert.\\" I like especially their take on Paul Bley's boppish \\"Big Foot.\\"<br /><br />Wasilewski and Hersch don't sound at all alike but they sound like they've come through the same school in some respects. There is the expanded use of the keyboard, and a greater and more varied use and placement of chords -in Hersch's case, whole solo stretches done chordally rather than in single note streams. In each group, the musicians listen to each other more intensely. The bass has been left off the leash of four beats to a bar thumping out chord bases, and the drums do more than keep the time. There seems in both cases, especially in Hersch's case, a greater willingness to draw on music other than jazz.<br /><br />Enough! Faithful is just an exceptional album. But it and see if you don't agree.rather than in single note streams. In each group, the musicians listen to each other more intensely.

1594744769|2.0|I liked the book in the beginning - it had me intrigued. As I continued the story got very boring. I began to dislike the main character A LOT. By the end of the book I wanted to backhand him. The ending was one of those where you think \\"really?\\" and you're pretty mad that you read the entire thing for such an anticlimactic finish.     It seemed unclear to me who this was written for: initially it came off as juvenile but some of the language within the book suggested otherwise.     Would I read a sequel to this book? No, I would not waste my time. I only gave this two stars because of the good beginning.

And, because Grandma and Auntie are both hairdressers, the allure of fussing with the long hair is all that much attractive!<br /><br />This is a cute and fun doll. I suspect that the hair won't look like new for long, but it certainly will be well-loved!
B0043URV8M|5.0|As good as the book are written, so is the music for this soundtrack. It sets the moods all perfectly for each and every background, conversation, battle, silly times, dark times, hopeful & hopeless times. The composer (Alexandre Desplat) has the opportunity to really follow in the foot steps (and possibly overcome) the greats before him (Hans Zimmer, Ennio Morricone, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore, John Williams), and he had a lot to prove taking on the daunting task of composing music for such a Magical and Visually overwhelming story. He did spectacularly.

It also includes a book full of pictures from each of the seasons. I am a HUGE Friends fan and I absoluteluy loved this product, very nice layout.

B0059R5Q08|5.0|This adaptation felt very natural, with Jane presented as a dreamy, artistic, intelligent young woman who has a fortitude brought about by a childhood that was not kind but was not also overplayed. We are allowed to view her as if the most important things are about to happen, much the way it feels when young and venturing out into the world and relying on one's own character and strengths to succeed. She is more than the summary of a grim past and I very much like that she has finally been liberated a little from the demons of her childhood so that her own great beauty and simplicity shine through. For details, there are longer, more complete adaptations-personally, I'll just read the book again and enjoy that someone caught the spirit of Jane Eyre so perfectly. Mr Rochester, for once, was a rather sweet, if tormented man, and not so overbearing as to do a great deal more than prick the spirit of the girl into quick-witted response that shows her cleverness and his delight in her.

0553801473|1.0|I am completely convinced that the author of A Dance with Dragons is not the same person who wrote A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.  Here's my reasoning.  Take the book A Storm of Swords.  Open it to any page.  Now open A Dance with Dragons to the same page number.  Read the page in A Storm of Swords and immediately read the page of A Dance with Dragons.  Repeat this process three of four times.  A simliar comparison of A Dance with Dragons to A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings is worth the effort.<br /><br />Compare the use of dialog, narrative, and even punctuation.  The difference is amazing isn't it.  Most reviews are complaining that A Dance with Dragons is a poor companion to the first three books in the series based on plot and lack of forward momentum, but no one is addressing the reason behind the slip in quality. My take is that the difference in the very mechanics of writing between A Dance with Dragons and the first three books is so dramatic the it could not possibly be written by the same author.<br /><br />So who wrote A Dance with Dragons?  If it was truly George R. R. Martin, then who wrote the first three books?  It just can't be the same guy.

0790729377|5.0|I've studied the play, but never saw this film until I bought a copy of the DVD recently.  It won four Oscars.  It was the first time three acting Oscars were ever awarded for the same film.  Interestingly, Marlon Brando who was nominated lost to Humphrey Bogart in \\"The African Queen.\\"<br /><br />Vivian Leigh is so elegantly moving in this play.  Several decades ago, I saw Sandy Dennis play the role at the Robertson Theatre in Chicago.  What an amazing performance!  Leigh's Blanche is not quite so fluttery and vulnerable as Dennis was onstage, but the character moves magically through the events to the last frames as she descends into madness.  I recently watched the documentary [[ASIN:B0006UEVQ8 What the Bleep Do We Know!?]].  In that, they made a comment that a nervous breakdown is the failure to adapt to changing circumstances.  I thought that hit the nail on the head as far as Blanche's character.<br /><br />Marlon Brando's performance is a great one.  He listens so completely that we feel we can see the character's thoughts as they bubble up in the expressions on his face.  There is one moment at the birthday party right before Stanley explodes where he becomes completely still, soaking in the situation that revolts him.  He holds that for four or five seconds before banging his fist on the table.  His contrasts are superb.<br /><br />Karl Malden won the supporting Oscar as Mitch, the aging best friend who wants to find a girl.  Malden does an excellent job.  Kim Hunter's role as Stella is likewise gold.  Those moments where we see her drawn to Stanley so strongly, as if by magnetism or hypnosis, are stokes of genius.  Director Elia Kazan and screenwriter Tennessee Williams also had Oscar nominations.  Richard Day and George James Hopkins won the Oscar for Art and Set Decoration Black & White.  Lucinda Ballard was nominated for costume design, which was won that year by Edith Head for \\"A Place in the Sun.\\"  The film was nominated for Best Picture, which went to \\"An American in Paris.\\"  This is a strong film, quite close to the play.  It keeps our attention glued to the screen.  Bravo!aris.\\"  This is a strong film, quite close to the play.  It keeps our attention glued to the screen.  Bravo!

I cant tell you enough on how much I love this dub, just epic! They need to make dubs like these more often. :)

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This quite possibly could be the best air cooler for its price.  I recently purchased and installed a Hyper 212+ on a Core 2 Duo E8400 (LGA 775).  With the stock cooler, my average temperatures were:    Core 1 idle - 48C  Core 2 idle - 42C  Core 1 load - >60C  Core 2 load - 58C    After replacing the stock heatsink with the Hyper 212+, my average temps have dropped to:    Core 1 idle - 36C  Core 2 idle - 32C  Core 1 load - 48C  Core 2 load - 46C    This is excellent performance compared to the price.  Installation is typical for an aftermarket cooler - it will require you to remove your motherboard in order to mount the backplate.  However, it is not remarkably difficult.  Printed directions could be clearer, but are adequate to explain how to mount it.    Pros:  * Average temperature drop of 10-12C over stock cooling (in my case)  * Remarkably low cost for cooling performance  * Should fit in most mid or full towers (I would not recommend it for slimline cases)  * Expandable with second 120mm fan for push/pull setup - mounting brackets included  * Compatible with wide variety of CPU sockets, including LGA 775, 1155, 1156, and 1366, and AM2, AM2+ and AM3    Cons:  * Included directions may be unclear to someone inexperienced with installing aftermarket coolers  * While not \\"heavy,\\" heavy enough to require backplate, which means removing motherboard to mount    This is definitely a cooler I would recommend to anyone needing to improve their cooling solution without spending a huge amount.  It performs on par with many more expensive coolers, and its flexibility in socket support means you can keep it when you upgrade, at least for the immediate future.  There are better coolers out there for more money, but I don't think you can beat this one for the price.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|**** May be spoilers below.  Only little things.  I will not put anything big or important!!!!****<br /><br />This was a neat movie.  I either have never seen or do not remember the originals, so I can not compare it.  The movie is about a scientist who is trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's.  Which is a disease that his father has.  He tests the cure out on Monkeys, to see what happens to them.  He finds that it makes them much smarter and gives them the ability to do things that they could not do before.  The group that is giving him the money towards his research comes in to hear about what he has and needs.  He will show them how the medicine works by showing them what the test monkey can do.  Something happens and the monkey goes crazy.  It tares apart the offices and starts to attack them.  They have no choice but to kill the ape and all the others that they are doing the tests on.  The monkey that went crazy may leave something behind that carries the advantage that the new medicine gave him.  The scientist takes the monkey home for a short time at first, until he can find a place to keep it from being killed.  Years go by and the monkey has grown.  Through out the movie you see the monkey starts wondering where it came from and it all it is thought of is an animal.  Eventually, the monkey may go somewhere else to live and decides that it is time to free himself and the others.<br /><br />There you go, that is the movie.  You really feel the emotions of the monkey or all of the monkeys.  They did a good job of showing you that some wanted peace and freedom, while others wanted power and control.  The monkeys actually seem to have personalities.  You will be surprised by the fact that you feel like you know them and understand what they want and why they are angry.  It is like they are people.  Very well done in that regard.  The problems that I had with the movie are these.  All the main action in the movie.  Be it the monkeys attacking or escaping, happens in the last 20 or 30 minutes.  The first main part of the movie is all about how the problems started and what happens from them.  I still thought the movie was a lot of fun and worth seeing.  But this is one of those movies that I could watch once and it could and probably would have been a smarter choice to see it at home.<br /><br />If you think about it, it is a good thing that they did not make a movie that was all apes killing people.  They took the time to build up to what would happen.  Another thing that kind of bothered me was this.  For anything that the monkeys did or would do.  The things that you know would have happened to them did not.  I do not want to give anything away.  It was just a weak, strange ending.  The movie was slow, fast and action packed, then back to slow.  If you are wanted to see 100% fast paced action, this may not be for you.  But, my mom, step brother and I did enjoy it.  So it was good for that.  This is not a movie I could ever see myself buying.  Once was enough for me.

B000AMJC2K|3.0|It has a sturdy construction & was relatively easy to install, but its Horizontal range is a bit short.  I have not needed to adjust my monitor much, so I cannot address any of the complaints about allen screws wearing out or connections loosening up. The cable clamps are a bit confounding, but once you figure out how they work, a dab of super glue where the 2 pieces fit together in the arm's slots for them will fix that.    I wanted to extend it further horizontally and bought the Lx Extension (Ergotron model 45 244 026 )for $29 after checking Ergotron's website.  It listed arms that the LX Extension would not be compatible with and this arm was not listed, so I bought it.  It does not fit (holes on each end are too big), but it is compatible with Ergotron's more expensive (45-241-026) & LX HD Wall Mount(45-268-026) arms.    The seller charges a $5 re-stocking fee and shipping will be another $5 for the extension(IF they approve the return), so I may just try to modify it or sell it on Craigslist.    So, if you wanted to extend it another 8\\", you'd have to buy a second 45-174-300 Neo Flex arm, use the extension piece and find another use for the rest of the assembly.  Not sure if there would be any weight issues with this set-up (probably if your monitor is at the arm's maximum capacity).  Ergotron has no info about this on the 45-174-300 arm's product page.

B0000257O9|5.0|I've had The Buggles \\"The Age Of Plastic\\" for two years now, and have listened to it extensively in that time. I purchased the newly re-released follow-up CD \\"Adventures In Modern Recording\\" just recently. In my opinion this first release is superior to \\"Adventures.\\"   There is just something about this futuristic world that \\"The Age Of Plastic\\" resides in that just makes me happy and makes me want to visit there from time to time, as I do when I listen to it. I think that's what makes it so good, this CD transports you away from your silly worries and stresses that get in the way of living your life. From start to finish, TAOP is my little escape. I have it playing right this very moment as I write this. I have it on repeat. I don't think I'll be coming home anytime soon. Perhaps \\"Adventures In Modern Recording\\" will have the same effect on me given some time. Gotta go...I'm boarding the Monorail with Johnny now.
B0035G02MW|5.0|The first chapter is a masterpiece in itself. I have been severely deaf since my late 20s and the description of the everyday experiences deaf people endure had me laughing all day. The rest of the story is similar to a Film Noir genre, with the conventional triad of Femme Fatale, Good Wife and manipulated incapacitated husband who feels he is losing his power. The third layer of this book is Linguistics, which I've always had an interest in. I'm glad I found this book, which was recommended to me by another deaf person. I will be reading more of his books in future.
0061784788|2.0|Let me start out by saying that I am a fan of James Rollins and have read all his books.  His earlier books were amazing reads, and kept me on the edge of my seat. I would devour them in a short amount of time and always be left wanting to read more.  Having said that, this book is taking me the longest time to finish.  Maybe it's just me and my interests have changed, but I can't get through this book.  The characters all feel very flat, and the \\"action\\" is all recycled scenes from other Rollins novels.  At this point, I'm not even done with the book, and I am counting down the pages until I finish.  I have been less then thrilled with the past few books from James Rollins, but this is by far the most boring.  Way to much technical info. I feel like I am back reading The Lost Symbol from Dan Brown.  That was another book that I counted down the pages, and  just wanted it to end.  Hopefully the last 180 pages I have left will redeem this book, but I highly doubt it.  Highly disappointed, as I always looked forward to the new James Rollins book every year.

0439023521|4.0|Sixteen-year-old Katniss lives in a bleak future Appalachia, renamed District 12 by the Capitol, a Rome-like city-state which keeps all the Districts on the edge of starvation to supply itself with fantastic wealth.  Katniss barely keeps her family alive by illegally hunting outside her town's decrepit fences with her childhood friend Gale.  Then she finds herself swept into the Hunger Games, the annual ceremony in which the Capitol forces the people of the twelve Districts to watch on live TV as two dozen of their children fight each other to the death in a huge wilderness arena, as a brutal proof that the Districts are completely at the Capitol's mercy.    Suzanne Collins's sense of narrative pace is faultless; the book flies along and can easily be finished in a night.  The plot is an interesting mix of inspirations, part Takami's Battle Royale, part Orwell's 1984, part vicious satire of reality TV.  Parts of it could well have been drawn directly from Collins's nightmare journal: the tongueless Avoxes, the tracker jacker wasps whose sting induces terrifying hallucinations, and worst of all, the grisly origin of the muttations bred by the Capitol.  Collins never lets us forget Katniss's constant pain, fear and resentment; this is not in any sense an adventure, but a murderous, traumatic ordeal.  Indeed, this science fiction book paints a better picture of what war feels like for the weaker side than any work of historical fiction that I know.  The people from whom Katniss most needs help are the very people that the Games' rules require her to kill, facing her with constant conflict throughout the book, and the one strain of hope that survives the story is that Katniss does manage to form bonds with some of the other fighters in the arena with her.    Collins may have been analogizing the wealthy Capitol and its impoverished Districts to America (or the rich world countries in general) and the Third World.  If so, the analogy is certainly not exact - America doesnot have anywhere near so strong a hold over poor countries as the Capitol does over the Districts - but in the Capitol's frivolity and indifference to the poverty that surrounds it, the parallel to the average American is uncomfortably close.    The book is certainly far from perfect.  The ending is predictable and the final obstacle proves much easier to surmount than it should have been; it is hard to believe that nobody in the previous 75 Games has ever done what Katniss does at the end here, or that the Capitol has not devised an answer to it.  Furthermore, Katniss's character development is weak; she is stillv ery recognizably the same person at the end of the Games that she was at the beginning.  Some may fault the book for lack of originality; as I have mentioned, its roots in Takami and Orwell are all too obvious.  But it is not a stale retread; Collins has taken what she has experienced and transformed it into something new.  Very much like a mockingjay.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Good science fiction is about how a new technology would change humanity and its institutions. The Matrix's new technology is a form of virtual reality. The Terminator's is time-travel + an emergent god-computer, Mad Max is post-nuclear-apocalypse fiction, Jurassic Park is about the cloning of animals, and tens of thousands of scifi novels are about space travel and how it would change humanity.<br /><br />Really good science fiction makes you think not only about what a human institutions might to become, but what they are, now.  The 'new tech' in Daemon is network technologies, the human-institutions are our gov systems.<br /><br />Daemon is action-packed and fun, but it also really made me think. The ending seemed ambiguous at first, but the more I thought about it the better I liked it.<br /><br />(I would add that I 'read' Daemon as an Audible book, and the narrative production was superb, the best I ever heard.)

It was very handy to be able to not bring my dedicated camera bag and use this as a hybrid for walks and sightseeing. After using it for 11 days, here are my conclusions (note that I'm no pro photographer, just a hobbyist):    Pros  - The size of the bag is great for day trips - not nearly as big as a regular back-pack, but enough for essentials. You can jam a lot of stuff into that top compartment. As a sizing example, a large 1.5 liter bottle of water needed to be put slightly on angle to fit - the zipper would not close if it was standing straight up.  - Quality construction and strong zippers  - Straps at bottom are handy for an extra coat  - The camera storage is solid - moveable separators and tall enough that I could easily fit my Nikon D-3000 body with 55-200 lens attached.  - Happily found out that the camera storage compartment stays closed even when it's not zipped. Took a whole hike with it wide open, and didn't discover until the end. Because of the way the compartments separate and the bag lays on your back, it naturally stays closed and nothing fell out.  - Very comfortable to carry, straps are padded nicely.     Cons  - Biggest issue was this - you cannot access the camera part of the bag without taking off the bag. Even one-shouldered, it was very awkward. You really can't get easy-quick access with this bag.   - when there is stuff in the top of the bag, it doesn't usually sit upright on it's own - falls over easily.    Nit-picks  - Would have loved to have a few more pockets on the inside, but one did the trick adequately. However, when the bag falls over, things fall out of that one pocket and are then lose in your bag.  - The way the top opens is a little awkward and takes some getting used to (the bulk of the items in that compartment are located to one side of the zipper). It's hard to explain, but if you unzip it and need to add something, you'll be pulling the back open, rather than the front down.     Overall, I would recommend it and I'll love using it again.
0316789798|5.0|I am so stoked that they still make these books so I can buy them for my son. These books were easy to follow and allowed me to associate what was in my imagination with the real shapes that put them on paper. I didn't end up going to art school but I was accepted in some pretty great places and I give Ed Emberley partial credit. I got these books when I was about 4 or 5 and they are the foundation for every pictionary game I ever played, every art class I ever took and every school project I ever did, and even the foundation of teaching my 3 year old to draw.
B0013MYNYS|5.0|This review will strictly address the Blu-Ray version of this movie. This version is produced in 7.1 channel sound.  When played through the sound system of my TV (only a 4-year old Toshiba), the sound was full of static at numerous points in the film.  Every adjustment I could think of to work around the problem failed.  The 5.1 channel extras disc played just fine.  The static ruined what could have been an enjoyable movie.  So unless your TV and sound system is really current, you could wind up with a bad sound experience too.  I have no complaints at all about the video presentation of the film.  The visual experience was terrific.<br /><br />I recently discovered that the \\"driver\\" for my then-new DVD player was not updated.  Who knew that you had to update a DVD player right out of the box like a computer.  I surely didn't.  (And don't call me Shirley.) After learning how to update the driver, the sound quality is now excellent as well as the picture.  My apologies for my prior low review.
0316789704|5.0|I have been scrambling since my son was able to make a circle to find this classic treasure and a few of the others around because I KNOW I would never have tossed them. So glad that they are still around, perhaps updated but still the same at the core. These books had such a huge impact on me developing my artisitc skills that I am so excited to share them with my child. Its not any one picture, but its a skill building book that allows a child to relate to using every day shapes and a systematic approach to get what is in their head onto the paper. Mr. Emberley's Drawing book had a more profound impact on my future than any Dr. Suess book ever could. Someone stated the book was \\"mundane\\" but the creativity is in the child not the book, this is an avenue to direct it to escape with crayons.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|When i first heard that there was going to be another book set in the universe were the greek gods rule i was really suprised and a little scard. I was scared that Riordan wouldnt do as well with the heroes of Olympus series. But now i have nothing to fear. This perfectly paced story was entertaining and exciting making me want to keep turning page after page. I literally couldn't put it down this new story of the roman gods and a roman camp was a perfect base on how to make this book. Awsome come back
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a slick L.A. criminal defense attorney in the movie adaptation of Michael Connelly's legal thriller \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\". Many of Sexy Mcconaughey's fans may remember him as a Mississippi lawyer 15 years ago in the movie adaptation of John Grisham's legal thriller \\"A Time to Kill\\". Those fans will be pleased to know that the guy still looks great arguing in a courtroom!!! This time, Sexy McConaughey is Mick Haller, who's familiar to fans of Connelly's best-selling detective novels as the half brother of the LAPD's Harry Bosch. Haller's an unorthodox smoothie: His \\"Legal Office\\" is the backseat of his chauffeured Lincoln Continental(hence the movie title \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\").  Sexy McConaughey's newest client, is Louis Roulet(played by Ryan Phillippe).  Louis Roulet is the son of a rich family, and he's been charged with attempted rape and murder. He swears innocence, but he may or may not be guilty...  And his case bumps up against that of another former Haller client already wrongly convicted.  When Sexy McConaughey uncovers a deep, dark secret of his client Louis Roulet(Ryan Phillippe)the whole thing gets Haller's morals whirling in a way that makes you hugely admire him.  In the end, I will say justice is truly served to Ryan Phillipe's character Louis Roulet as it is deserved!!!  To some this may strike a sensitive nerve...  In my opinion: This movie is by far one of Matthew McConaughey's best, alongside John Grisham's \\"A Time To Kill\\"!!!  I strongly recommend people to buy or rent this movie:-)
B0006A9FKA|3.0|If you are like me, you've most likely heard over and over how hilarious this \\"must see\\" movie is. After seeing Hot Fuzz and Paul I fell head-over-heals for the dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I purchased this movie and assumed I was in for a huge treat. I was let down. It wasn't nearly as funny as it needed to be, and I would say it was much more graphic than it needed to be.<br /><br />By all means it was a \\"good\\" movie, but it was no where near the standard of Hot Fuzz. Perhaps if my expectations hadn't been so hi I would have enjoyed it more. In general it came off as a forgettable (if somewhat funny) film.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I have to preface this with the comment that I'm used to my PS3 controllers, and actually like them a lot. I know many people prefer the XBox layout, but something about the PS3 controllers just suit me.<br /><br />That said, if you like XBox controllers, this should suit you just fine. It connects easily and quickly to the PS3, though it does require a USB dongle so that uses up one port.  It also has the effect of automatically setting this controller to controller 1 every time you turn the PS3 on which, if you want to use the PS3 controller, can be a pain.<br /><br />But other than that, the layout is very close to the XBox, it supports the dual rumble feature on the PS3, and the action on all triggers and buttons was just fine. I also really liked the lightup buttons. The charge lasts sufficiently long, and the charging cable is longer than a stock PS3, which is nice. Overall, a pretty nice package<br /><br />One last point: the grip is quite heavily textured with small round bumps. I suppose that might be nice for some, but as they aren't rubberized (they're simply hard plastic), I'm just not really a fan personally. I do acknowledge that some people may love the texture though, so you'll have to be the judge.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|While I have to admit that I haven't seen EVERY adaptation of Jane Eyre, I have see three and this is by far my favorite!  Toby Stephens does an incredible job of portraying Rochester with his mood swings.  Their relationship seems natural and easy, unlike some adaptations I've seen.  While some say the second cd (when the two characters are separated) loses some of it's magic, I have mixed feelings.  It does lose it's magic to some degree but I felt like the book did that as well and this adaptation does a far better job of keeping your interest than any other version I've seen by showing how hard Rochester fought and pleaded to keep Jane in his life and how hard it was for her to leave him behind.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Makes file transfers between phone and computer much easier. By far the best solution I've come across yet. No more having to wrestle with the Bluetooth connection! Highly recommended.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This item for the price is quite a steal. The movie itself is a beautiful masterpiece in regular dvd, add blu ray and 47 inch LED tv you are in for one great movie night. this movie is a great idea for a date night in with your favorite sweetheart or just a good old comedic/romantic/semi-action fantasy movie. this movie really takes hold of your imagination and leaves you feeling satisfied. where some movies can dissapoint because you thought they would be better(like the watchmen /fail) and are completely lame; this movie will satisfy and keep you watching the whole time. 5 stars!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The CD is wonderful and brings back my memories in college.  Everywhere I have seen it, the CD is over 20 dollars (brand new).   Has the very best  songs  and trust me,  buy it and you'll see....
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Excellent cinematography combined with incredible acting, set design, costumes, and a spot on script will make this part of English history come alive!
B00006RAKP|5.0|The CD arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  The CD ia amazing and has all the hits I remember from the past.  Truely worth buying and listening to. Amazon has the best prices for old CD's.  I always check here first before going to the stores. I have been looking to purchase this for awhile and it was time.  I purchased this with the Very Best of Fleetwood Mac.  Bought both and saved on free shipping.
0553801473|5.0|My husband devoured this book as quickly as the preceding books in the series - loved them all! I'm on the second book and look forward to catching up to him, and I'm not usually a fantasy reader. Thanks for another great addition to the story!
B003EY7IRC|3.0|The fever series started out great but the final book while a long wait was not worth it.  The MacKayla of the first 4 books somehow morphed into a character who now was unsure of her life growing up and \\"never fit in\\".  Really and this is the first time KMM thought to mention it?  The first time any reader hears about her \\"dreams\\".  What editor let her get away with this and didn't say a thing?      Don't get me wrong she is a great writer but this fell far short of the mark.  Stick with the Highlander series.  You will be much happier.
B004C5M282|5.0|This album is wonderful. A very nice addition to the current discography. Volbeat is a hardcore band that loves to take care of their fans.

Also, you should check out their fancorp site any help promoting can be rewarding.   [...]
B004MARLJ2|5.0|Usually games that are full of cartoon animals do not appeal to me, but this is a notable exception. It is incredibly challenging, and is overall a great puzzle game. Obscure reference time: it reminds me of the card games from final fantasy 8 and 9. This = lots of fun. The story is even pretty decent. Note that this is a turn based strategy tile capture game, so having a decent story is pretty impressive.
1423389387|4.0|This review is based on the audio book. Like many people, I use audio books on long car trips to combat fatigue and highway hypnosis. I suspect that I am enjoying this book more this way than I would if I were actually reading it. As a work of literature, it deserves about 3 stars, but because of a fine dramatic reader, this audio book is getting 4 stars from me.<br /><br />It doesn't matter that I have not read or listened to the first book in this series. The \\"plot\\" is discursive and rambling and is not presented with any urgency. The author has an older version of the main character, now a tavern keeper in a small town, reminiscing about his youth as a student of magic/musician in a magical university.<br /><br />The author has a verbose style, describing in heavy-handed prose every turn of every conversation, so that we know what the speaker does with his lips, eyes, eyebrows and elbows. Fortunately, the reader of this audio book has a great turn for doing the voices and conveying the characters and his smooth voice is a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />The book was slow to get started. There was a long dedication, then a boring opening in the tavern where it turns out something interesting happened the previous night, then finally the innkeeper settles in to tell the visiting scribe the story of his youth. I almost switched over to the radio, but I stuck with it and gradually I got drawn in.<br /><br />The main attraction of this fantasy is the characters. By and large, they are pleasant company, suffer interesting troubles and are a varied bunch. Kvothe (sounds like Quoth) is overly talented in music and magic and insufficiently wise. His biggest talent is getting into trouble and annoying people in high places. He spends more nights on rooftops then in his bed sleeping. Of course he has red hair and woman find him attractive.<br /><br />If I were reading this, I'd have stopped by now. Because it is being read to me, I'm happy to go with the flow. This book is way too long. It is 43 hours of audio book and I suspect that the ending will be rambling and inconclusive. It's a journey, not a destination. That's why this thing is perfect to take along on a long car trip!book and I suspect that the ending will be rambling and inconclusive. It's a journey, not a destination.

B00005JLEU|5.0|My daughter originally watched this movie at the age of 2 and I am just now having to replace the dvd because it has gotten so much use that it is skipping now.  This is where her love of anime started and she always returns to this movie.  (She is 9 now btw.)
B004EPZ070|5.0|I am a huge Emily Giffin fan and truthfully I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie. Many times the movies aren't as good as the books. There were changes made to fit the time constant, but the changes that were mad I thought enhanced the story. Instead of falling in love with Ethan in book two we get to love him in the movie or I did! I hope they make something blue into a movie too!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Like portal, this game offers exactly what you expect, a bunch of fun puzzles that make you think, but are solvable. You get more than enough pieces to accomplish a puzzle so there are countless ways to beat each level. Yet the limited amount of space forces you to think and not make it too easy. A really fun game that gets harder at a perfect rate which allows for progressive and keeps it interesting by adding new features. There is one small control problem that other reviews point out that bothered me at first, but I cant see a better way to do it, and you get used to it. Fun game, worth it.
B001DMJ9VA|5.0|I had lost the original tape (remember tape) on this concert. Was happy with the $$ and the DVD as well. The 2 extra rehearsal songs were great. You could say this was a revival for him, and his classic covers since have been well-received!
B00064X3BI|3.0|Every track on this disc with the exception of Cocaine sounds amazing. Something about that recording, it just sounds muffled to me. Still a great song and the rest of the clarity on the disc makes this a must own for any SACD fan. I just wish Cocaine sounded as good as the rest of the album.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's not all that sophisticated of an App, but it serves the purpose.  But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them.  Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library.  I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to.
B001EWW7MW|4.0|To me, the 2006/2007 masterpiece Theatre adaption of Jane Eyre is the best I've seen. I love the chemistry between the actors in that one and Toby Stephens is the Rochester i've seen. And I also loved the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton although I think Timothy was way too Good lookig for that role, I think he did a great job. That version is as close to the book as i have seen. you don't see that very often, I was very surprised.  This version with William Hurt left out alot of good and important scenes. The acting was very good. I actually liked it better than the original with Orson Wells. But It's pretty good.
0439023521|5.0|I had heard of the Hunger Games before, but often brushed it off as this book (and it's two following books in the series) are slotted in that Scholastic books cryptic 'young adult' category. I just finished The Hunger Games and can say without a doubt that this is a phenomenal book appropriate for all readers. I'll even venture to say that I think the whole 'young adult' science fiction novel thing is strangely categorized, as the vocabulary and subject matter are far more mature than I can see any 12-15 year old reading.    I finished the book in a week flat, and would have finished it in a day if pesky work and life hadn't gotten in the way. It's a riveting story, and am already reading the next book in the series and loving it. The writing is fantastic!    I'd highly, highly suggest reading this and the others in the series.

0553801473|4.0|I'm sad to say that this book doesn't come close to the bar that Martin set with the first three books. However, I don't think it deserves all the 1 & 2 star reviews that people have been posting.<br /><br />The fast action excitement of the first three books is completely gone and is replaced by slow meandering of the Feast. However, since unlike the Feast, this book concentrates on the characters that I actually care about (Tyrion, Jon, Dany), I'd say it deserves 3.5 stars... rounding up to 4.<br /><br />If you've read the first four books, you know you're going to get this one to see what happens. If you're new to the series, perhaps curious about the books after watching the TV series - this specific book isn't great but the first three sure are so do pick those up!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Excellent movie. I really do not understand, because it has been so undervalued. Visually it is very good, but the bluray is a bit granny. The story is well told and the pace is fine too. The actions are consistent and the effects are fantastic. Overall I think this film is very solid and shows again that Snyder handles very well the effects and such stories. Really pleased with this purchase.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love the Song of Ice and Fire books.  I agree that you are buying a product, not just a story, and that product itself should be reviewed.  However, no one so far has mentioned whether or not the Kindle edition has the same printer errors as the physical paperbacks.  I can't see why it would, but I'd like to know for sure before I drop so much cash, even if it is a good value for so many great books in one.      So technically I'm cheating a little, condradicting what I just said, and reviewing the old-school MMP copy of the books I already own.  Wonderful storyline(s), not for children, quite an undertaking.  I recommend making notes of the different characters.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|I enjoyed Sucker Punch for the theatrics and visuals!  The plot was rather simple but there IS a plot, and I thought it was played out well.  There is plenty of harsh reality and there ARE character personalities.  While some reviews complain about the lack of emotional connection to the characters, I don't believe that it's because there was a lack of development, I think that it was because the connections weren't all warm and fuzzy for what might be the heroines.  There were character flaws even with them.  Which I believe to be a harsh reality in itself, and I enjoyed as opposed to the typical Hollywood hero.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This is an awesome album, been a fan from the beginning, have all albums but there is a sound issue like everyone is saying so I searched and found the guitar hero version on the net and made me a cd from it and problem solved since they are obviously not going to fix it.    Everyone rags on St Anger, Load and Re Load but im a Metallica fan, even if its not Justice or the Black album or Master its still Metallica, yea the drums sounded different on St Anger but FRANTIC rocks and without Bob Rock we would not have the Black album like it is now.
B000002VJH|4.0|Blues for Allah is the Grateful Dead's experimental folk/jazz/psychedelic conglomeration.  In my opinion, it's far from a classic.  I don't feel this way just because it's a studio album.  I like studio Grateful Dead just fine and I honestly don't believe their live albums are *that* much better quality-wise.  I was honestly shocked going into Blues for Allah today.  I didn't read any reviews and instead just dove right in and listened to it, so I'm a bit surprised what it sounds like.      My main complaint is that the vocals are, for the most part, really weak.  In some instances the vocals CLEARLY don't belong in between the spaced out guitar trickery that runs through the album.      A good example is on the 12-minute \\"Blues for Allah\\" suite on side two.  The first 3 minutes are really mediocre because the vocal melody sounds so simplistic and corny.  I believe had this vocal melody been put into the possession of a British band, they would have made it cooler.  At least it improves once \\"Sand Castles & Glass Camels\\" comes in afterwards- this is because this particular aspect of the piece has some really hypnotic guitar work totally reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane's \\"Spare Chaynge\\" but not nearly as cool because it's already been done by several artists back in the 60's.  By 1975, the music scene had done changed... but don't tell these guys that.     Actually that's not entirely true- the fact such a guitar sound has been done before isn't the problem.  It really does sound like Jerry Garcia is trying desperately to sound like the psychedelic After Bathing At Baxter's period of the Jefferson Airplane on this particular track.  The entire thing winds down with more vocals during \\"Unusual Occurrences in the Desert\\" which are perhaps an improvement over the vocals we had to endure when the song began, but only a very slight improvement.  Anyway, despite my complaining, \\"Sand Castles & Glass Camels\\" is saved by featuring really cool guitar work.     \\"Help on theWay\\" actually resembles a disco song, or at the very least, the kind of glossy commercial pop you'd hear in abundance back in the mid 70's.   It still has a decent groove going for it, so it's passable.  \\"Slipknot\\" is a relatively forgettable jam of sorts.  It begins with these guitar parts too sparsely arranged to make much of an impression, but soon it develops.  The actual notes never stick with me, but it sounds nice.  \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\" is based around some brief, speedy guitar licks.  Nothing that blows me away but it's good enough.  \\"Stronger Than Dirt or Milk In the Turkey\\" gets a positive reception JUST for the hilarious song title alone!  Unless I'm overlooking something, this is basically the same thing as \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\" but with short dashes of jazzy keyboards and quick drum fills tossed in between the guitar licks.      Alright, time to mention the real meat and potatoes.  \\"Crazy Fingers\\" is 6 minutes long and not much of it is devoted to guitar soloing (if any).  It's just a REALLY catchy vocal melody with reggae beats moving the song forward.  It's a nice experiment for the band.  Speaking of experiments, \\"Sage & Spirit\\" is *drastically* different from anything the Grateful Dead has ever attempted before- a classical/flute instrumental.  A VERY good one, too.  Maybe my favorite song on the entire album.  \\"The Music Never Stopped\\" is some kind of country/dance affair with another strong vocal melody and, believe it or not, underrated guitar soloing (since it appears in all the right spots).  \\"Franklin's Tower\\" has the best chorus on the entire album, and if you don't know much about this band you might be surprised when you hear this great chorus and realize you've heard it somewhere before- it's a fairly popular song.       Overall, I like this album.  You're probably thinking \\"You don't REALLY like it or you'd, you know, write a nicer review!\\"  Well... that's true, haha.   Let me just say this- I admire the Grateful Dead's studio output.  I realize some fans will say I'm not experiencing the REAL version of the band because, as we all know, the Grateful Dead excelled on stage in a live setting.  They have a TON of live albums available for purchase; most of which will never see the light of day in my CD player.  I just don't see the need to devote all my time and energy to the Grateful Dead by purchasing a bucketload of their live albums when there's literally hundreds of other artists and guitar players more deserving of my time.      I believe Blues for Allah is a really good album.  It's no American Beauty of course, but I don't really care about that.  There's a reason Blues for Allah is one of the more popular studio albums by the Grateful Dead- the songwriting and the guitar solos are -contrary to my negative review- a little better than usual this time around, so I recommend a purchase.
1416550550|5.0|A very enjoyable book.  Yes, it is a bit long, but little mysteries keep arising and you don't have to wait long to find out what they are about, which is satisfying to the reader.  No real dull parts for me.
0971407614|5.0|Like many intense people, I have been an exercise fanatic all my life. Even as I approach the age of 70 (Next year) I still seek out material on how to improve myself physically and mentally.

I have never seen a book with so many different exercise variations to make your workout interesting and productive.  He shows how to kick up your body weight exercise program to continue making strength and power gains.<br /><br />This fantastic book covers how to become lean, strong and confident, and how bodyweight exercises can provide everything you will ever need to get and stay in top physical condition.  There is a big emphasis on building body strength to increase your overall physical fitness.  Basic nutrition is also covered as well as common strength training myths.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a MUST own book for anyone who is really into physical fitness.  Instructors will especially want this book as a reference source because of the number of variations shown in all the exercises.<br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J.

0307120007|2.0|I ordered a number of books for my godson who is 6months. I wanted pat the bunny, because of the good reviews on here and because it is a classic. I was NOT HAPPY when I recieved it, but I had opened it (so I couldnt return it) to get a better look because the book and box came very damaged on the sides. When he opened them today it was clearly his least favorite. I felt though that if I bought this book any later it would be very boring, even when he could actually read the words. Thank god I ordered huge board books of baby's first words,colors,and shapes, babys first animals, and baby's first 100 words cause he loves those. So for someone in a similar position, I'd buy this in person, or get a hardcover of it cause it damages fast.
1401216676|4.0|This was everything I expected it to be.  I've never been into Batman, Or anything Dc for that matter, But I love Alan Moore.  So, I ordered it, It arrived, I read it.  Art work is spectacular, Story is great, and watching Batgirl get shot in the stomach at point blank range was AWESOME.  The only problem I had with it was the length. The book was practically over once you really get into it.  Also, If you love Alan's work as much as I, then some of the afterword and stuff like that will kinda annoy you.    Bottom line, If you like Alan Moore, BUY IT.   I'm not sure how true Batman fans like it, so I would look into that if you love Batman.

The book Outliers studies marked deviations from mainstream in areas from successful people, unusually high airline crash rates, genius IQ levels, and more.    In regards to the subject of success, the author writes that \\"society's notion is that the best and the brightest who effortlessly rise to the top is much too simplistic.\\"  In the story about the Canadian hockey players who were predominately born in Jan, Feb, or March, sociologist Robert Merton calls this phenomenon the \\"Matthew Effect\\" after the New Testament verse in the gospel of Matthew:  \\"For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance.  But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\\"  Success breeds success.  The author writes: \\"If you make a decision about who is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the \\"talented\\" from the \\"untalented\\"; and if you provide the \\"talented\\" with a superior experience, then you're going to end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.\\"  In relation to this, we see how the family support system is so crucial to a child's future success.  Child actors and actresses are a great example.  How many young actors and actresses have a passion and talent for acting, but don't have support from family and friends, nor the opportunities to practice and let their talent shine or be noticed.  Conversely, how many young and successful actors and actresses became a success because of a \\"superior experience:\\" a supportive home and parents who challenged their son or daughter to practice their passion, enrolled them in acting classes, acting clubs, and the like, and helped foster their passion and ambition for acting.  It's not limited to acting, but so many other career examples that show that a child's upbringing and support system (or lack thereof) is without adoubt a very large contributing factor to the child's future success.     In chapter two, entitled The Ten-Thousand Hour Rule, it's easy to think that those individuals who display mastery over a skill were automatically destined to be a success because they were born with a god-given talent.  However, the truth is that to master anything, talent alone will not get you there.  One must have an incredible drive and discipline to practice and work very hard to hone that skill.  The author uses gifted musicians as an example, and writes:  \\"...research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works.  That's it.  And what's more, the people at the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than anyone everyone else.  They work much, much harder.\\"  The author cites the results of a study which concludes from research that the \\"magic number\\" for true expertise is 10,000 hours of practice.  Broken down into sizable chunks, this equates to three hours a day, 365 days a year, for 9.1 years!  A story was told that in the 90's, Larry Bird was hired by Sprite to be part of a TV commercial.  Part of the act was for Bird to shoot a shot from about 12 feet out and intentionally miss.  It took Bird seven attempts before he finally missed the shot!  It's no argument that Bird was one of the greatest basketball players ever to play the game.  But Larry Bird wasn't born with a skill that guaranteed him as spot in the NBA.  Larry Bird's work ethic and hours of practice are what got him there. Larry Bird's KC Jones, relayed a story that after winning his first championship with the Celtics in the 80's, Bird was in the gym the next morning, practicing for next season!  Larry Bird knew that true mastery over the game of basketball required a lot of practice and hard work.      In chapter seven, entitled The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes, the discussion on \\"mitigated speech\\" brought to mind what can happen at many companies when people in power are given this type speech by their subordinates.  Mitigated speech is defined as any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said, such as when one is being deferential to authority.  The author uses the example of a captain and crew on an airplane.  Successful flying involves teamwork and effective communication between the captain, co-pilot and others.  Mitigated speech to the captain from the co-pilot and crew can be detrimental to the safety of the flight and everyone on board.  The captain and crew need direct, unmitigated communication from one another to be successful.  When business and marketing plans demonstrate obviously poor decisions, one must wonder if mitigated speech contributed to such bad decisions.  One example of a poor business and marketing decision is New Coke.  It was a disaster! Why did Coke replace the number one soda on the market, loved by millions of people around the globe, with a new flavor and call it \\"New Coke\\".  As the saying goes, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"  This might lead one to wonder how many at Coke were using mitigated speech with their superiors before New Coke was launched, rather than coming out and saying \\"This idea is bad! Stick with what we have.\\"  One wonders if the decision-maker(s) behind the production and launch of New Coke were being paid lip service by their subordinates who were afraid to express disagreement.      It was intriguing to read the way in which Koreans communicate with one another.  The author shows how Korea, like many Asian countries, is receiver oriented in its communication.  Meaning it is the listener's responsibility the make sense of what is being said.  Here is an example the author uses:    Kwacang: It's cold and I'm hungry  (Meaning: Why don't you buy a drink or something to eat?)  Mr. Kim:  How about having a glass of liquor?  (Meaning:  I will buy liquor for you.)  Kwacang:  It's okay. Don't bother.  (Meaning:  I will accept your offer if you repeat it.)  Mr. Kim: You must be hungry. How about going out?  (Meaning: I insist upon treating you.)  Kwacang:  Shall I do so?  (Meaning: I accept.)     To a westerner reading this two-way communication probably appears very indirect in comparison to the manner of speaking in the west. Western culture is very direct and transmitter oriented.  It is the sender's responsibility to make sense of what is being said, not the listeners.   It would seem as though the two Koreans are \\"beating around the bush\\" and not getting to the point. However, the beauty in the exchange above is the polite nature in which it is delivered, leaving no room for insensitivity or indifference.  It's easy to understand how this type of communication between a co-pilot and captain, in a culture of high respect and regard for authority like Korea, could contribute to an outlier degree of flight crashes by the Korean airlines, cited in chapter seven.     To conclude, the book Outliers showed how skewed results in such areas as success, honor, flight safety and more, were heavily influenced and formed by such things as family support, culture, race, and upbringing.  I enjoyed reading the results of studies, and discovering why the particular Outliers existed. I was reminded that things are not always what they appear to be on the surface.
0307477479|5.0|Folks... if you're into the truly great classic novels of all time, ala  The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, and For Whom The Bell Tolls,etc... Get ready for that select list to include another.  There's a reason this book won the Pulitzer Prize, up against as great a co-finalist book as Jonathon Franzen's \\"Freedom\\".     This book will make the hair stand up on your arms.. by page 75 I had to put it down and mutter.. \\"No wonder.. that's a done deal. I don't care if the rest of the book is blank...give her the Pulitzer Prize just for that.\\" And they did. And the rest doesn't stop either... it just keeps coming at you. I'm stunned.    Everybody makes comparisons..especially at this level. I was bouncing between eerie feelings early on (with it's African safari setting) that I was reading the very best of Hemingway (The Short Happy Life Of Francis Macomber), somehow morphed with perhaps the all-time greatest first novel by anyone, The Sun Also Rises. Later still I found myself saying...pardon me... WTF!  Is this an adult Catcher In The Rye, times three?    The answer is yes. Those who reviewed this book poorly probably don't get Bob Dylan either. (Karen B. Baierl... if I missed this book as badly as you did.. I wouldn't tell anyone about it!) Personally, I think Americans should be down on their knees in thankfulness for the recent books by Jennifer Egan, Jonathon Franzen, and Richard Russo. All three of these artists are among the very best ever..all time. All the great classics you study in college were once modern..and time rendered its verdict. Make no mistake about time's verdict on this book. The most esteemed prize for fiction in the world is actually scant praise.. if you can believe that.    M. T. Keller
0060007737|5.0|The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is a book that teaches the importance, power, and fundamentals of branding. Using real-life examples, it also highlights common branding fallacies, as well as branding mistakes and how to avoid them.       The introduction of the book points out a market shift that is taking place.  The shift is from selling to buying.  The shift is enhanced and accelerated by branding.  For example, more and more car dealers are adopting the one-price strategy originally implemented by Saturn, which reduces the need for a salesperson.  Countless retailers such as pharmacies and clothing stores are self serve outlets.  Buying on the internet has also reduced the demand for sales people.  In an age of heavy duty advertising and promotion, as well as resources such as the internet, television, and magazines like Consumer's Report, people can become quickly educated on a brand without the help of a salesperson.      In Law Number 2:  The Law of Contraction, the author writes: \\"A brand becomes stronger when you narrow its focus.  If you want to build a powerful brand in the minds of consumers, you need to contract your brand, not expand it.\\"  WD-40, the powerful brand name for the water displacing spray, also owns the 3-In-One Oil, Lava, Spot Shot, X-14, Carpet Fresh, and 2000 Flushes.  However, the company has done a tremendous job of resisting brand expansion, and keeping the WD-40 name ONLY on the original spray for which it was founded.  Expanding the WD-40 brand to a name such as WD-40 Carpet Fresh, would blur the WD-40 name, and hurt the brand's power.  WD-40 is sticking with what has worked for so many years, and has successfully resisted the urge to foolishly expand the brand.    Law Number 3, The Law of Publicity, makes the case that publicity is more effective than advertising for building a brand.  In the consumer's mind, what others say about a brand is more powerful than what the company says. Therefore, branding strategies should first bedeveloped from a publicity point of view.  Additionally, product quality is meaningless to the media.  Publicists don't want to talk about what's better among competing product brands. They want to talk about what's hot, fresh, and new.  In the book Inside Steve's Brain, the author Leander Kahney points out that Apple has spent very little on advertising for the iPhone in relation to the amount of publicity it has received.  It is estimated that since the Apple iPhone's launch in 2007, the brand has received over $400 million in free publicity.  Advertising didn't build the iPhone brand. Publicity did.    The Amazon Kindle is another great example.  The Kindle has received millions in free publicity.  News shows publicized it. Time magazine wrote an article about it shortly after launch.  Larry King invited Jeff Bezos on the show to discuss the Kindle and its future.  This is just a few examples of the publicity generated by Kindle. Amazon has spent very little on advertising the Kindle.  Like the iPhone, the Amazon Kindle brand has been built through publicity.    Law Number 4, The Law of Advertising, states that after a brand is built by publicity, sooner or later it outlives its publicity potential.  When this happens, a brand must shift its branding strategy from publicity to advertising.  The author writes that \\"(Brand) leaders should look on their advertising budgets as insurance that will protect them against losses caused by competitive attacks.\\"  Take Nike, for example.  Nike is the leader in the athletic shoe brand category.  Does Nike generate as much publicity as it once did when the brand was being built? Of course not. So Nike now spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising to protect the Nike brand.  Any challenger to Nike will have to spend a fortune trying to keep up.    Law Number 7, The Law of Quality, states that quality is important, but brands are not built on quality alone.  The author writes that \\"Years of observation have led us to this conclusion:  there is almost no correlation between success in the marketplace and success in comparative testing of brands - whether it be taste tests, accuracy tests, reliability tests, durability tests, or any other independent, objective third-party testing of brands.\\"  The perception of quality resides in the mind of the buyer.  Building a more powerful brand serves to build the perception of quality in the mind.  Harley Davidson is a powerful brand.  Harley outsells all the Japanese brands year after year, and is priced higher than the Japanese brands.  But if you compared a Honda to a Harley, which one is actually better quality and more reliable? The Harley Davidson is going to cost more, but does this mean it's a higher quality bike?  Or take the Lexus brand, Toyota's line of luxury cars.  The perception is that a Lexus is of higher quality than a Toyota, but is it really that much better, and worth the extra money? Or is it just a higher-priced Toyota rebranded as a Lexus?  The point to be gleaned from this is that quality is more about branding and perception.  To build a quality brand, the focus must be narrowed (Law of Contraction) and combined with a better name and a higher price.      In conclusion, The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding was an entertaining, informative book that cited excellent examples and illustrations to demonstrate the power and importance of the laws being taught.  For those companies who are seeking to build a world-class brand, following these laws is certainly a proven step in the right direction.

0517548232|5.0|The book Economics In One Lesson is about economic policies, and how these policies should take into account the effect they will have on everyone involved, not just one group.  It also discusses and illustrates how economics should be focused on long term effects, rather than ignoring or overlooking the long term and only focusing on the short term.  The author states that the most common fallacy in economics is to concentrate on the short-run effects of policies on special groups and to ignore or belittle the long-run effects on the community as a whole.  Throughout the book, the chapters give lessons and examples that bring this one overriding lesson into focus.  The author sums up economics in a single sentence:  \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"      The author discusses the enormous faith many people have in government spending.  He writes: \\"There is no more persistent and influential faith in the world today than the faith in government spending.\\"  But he quickly points out the fallacy of assuming that things can be fixed if the government just spends more money on a given problem or weakness.   A current example of this fallacy in action is the public education system in the United States.  In the book by Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity, the author, John Stossel, discusses the public education system in the United States.  Many policy-makers and citizens alike have the notion that the best way to improve the public education system in our country is with more money.  But time after time, studies and statistics have shown that children aren't getting a better education when more tax dollars are given to the school system.  It's been proven that no direct correlation exists between the amount of money allocated to the public school system, and the quality of education a child receives.  Yet the mantra is frequently repeated by many:  \\"Give more money to our school system in order to improve it\\" as if this will automatically fix the problems.  There are a host of problems with the public education system, one of which is not a lack of funds.    The author states that \\"The economic goal of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest results with the least efforts.  The whole economic progress of mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor.\\"  He goes on to write: \\"Each of us is trying to save his own labor, to economize the means required to achieve his ends.  Every employer, small as well as large, seeks constantly to gain his results more economically and efficiently - that is, by saving labor.\\"  America is a highly technological, highly productive society.  America has the highest standard of living in the history of humanity.  Technology and innovation is abundant.  Unfortunately, a common economic delusion is that machines and technology destroy jobs.  If this were true, it could be said then that civilization contributed to unemployment with the first efforts to improve efficiency through labor-saving inventions like the wheel.  In a recent speech given by a politician, he suggested that \\"we go back to the days of living without ATM machines, because they have destroyed the jobs of many bank tellers.\\"  This illustrates the fallacy of concentrating on the short-run effects of something (implementing ATM machines) on a small group of people (bank tellers) and ignoring the long run positive effects on the community (business and consumers) as a whole.  The short-run effect is that fewer bank tellers are needed now that ATM machines are widely implemented and used.  However the long-run effects are advantageous to the economy.  Who manufactures the ATM machines?  Who creates and programs the software used in these machines?  Who services them when they need calibration, software upgrades, or repair?  ATM machines have created jobs, increased production, and raised the standard of living.  They have lowered costs for banks by reducing the amount of wages paid out to bank tellers.  In turn, banks have passed these savings onto the consumer.  ATM's have also increased our quality of life by making the task of depositing and withdrawing money quicker, easier, and more efficient (fewer lines, no dependence on bank  hours, and so forth).   The ATM market has increased production and efficiency, and contributed to the expansion of the U.S. economy.      In conclusion, I would highly recommend this book.  It was very informative and clearly written.  The author has a tremendous way of articulating tried and proven economic principles in a straightforward, understandable style.  I'm thoroughly convinced that if more politicians and legislators would have followed the common sense economic fundamentals and lessons found in this book, the present state of the U.S. economy would be much healthier and robust.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Stand By Me is about 4 boys who go on an adventure down the train tracks in search of a dead body, but really they find themselves, and who they're meant to be. Stand by Me IS the ultimate Coming of Age movie, and a movie that every young boy around the age of 12 or 13 should see. OK, so yeah it has swearing in it, but parents, you ultimately thing your children are PERFECT little angels and NEVER cuss? Gimme a break! Stand by Me is funny, heartwarming, sad, and really makes you feel for the kids. Speaking of the kids, there have never been a group of 4 boys who interact on screen the way these four do. The performances given by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O' Connell, and Cory Feldman are amazing and relatable. It's true, this movie is a \\"boys\\" movie, and not really for the girls or ladies here, but who really cares?! This movie stands as one of my true favorites, and never grows old with age!

B00005JL7Q|5.0|About A Boy is about two separate lives. That of Will, an egotistical 30 year old who doesn't care about anyone but himself. And that of Marcus, a lonely 12 year old boy who's mother is a serious suicidal woman. The movie is mainly about how these two meet, interact, and change each other's lives. Essentially, Marcus teaches Will that it's not to late to grow up, and Will teaches Marcus it's OK to be a kid at times. About A Boy is easily one of my favorite movies, and never fails me when I'm looking for something light and funny, but also a little deep. The jokes never get old, and it's just an all around good movie, and really makes you feel good along with it. Truly a Great Film!

0061928356|5.0|The Secret Daughter, a novel, is not just a novel, when you are the adoptive mother to a child adopted from very similar circumstances, and do not have any information about the birthfamily. This story is not just a story when it is so close to your own life situations that you project back and forth constantly trying to read your own future in its lines! It is compelling in the account of Kavita, her resolve to not let her second daughter meet the same fate as the first, her gut wrenching decision to give up the child at an orphanage and then still try to live with that decision.    The characterization does seem weak at times, especially when it comes to Krishnan and his relationship with Somer, but the story does capture the struggles of Somer very well, the conflict she goes through as a result of making the life choices she made, living with a husband and a child from a different culture, them trying to deny that connection till it becomes apparent to Somer that denial is only pushing the very people away who she wants to stay close to. I could relate to a lot of the sentiments particularly where she reflects on how she modified her career aspirations to make time for family, and the resentment she feels in being passed up for a position she was amply qualified for, in favor of someone much junior!    Overall, this hit very close to home, I had a hard time putting the novel down, and found myself deeply touched and permanently altered, and hopefully wiser for having read it.
0441013597|5.0|I read this book while commuting to work, and I often times found myself still reading well after I had arrived. Never have I flown through a book so quickly. Dune opens the reader up to a variety of intense emotions, it's language and depth so well conceived that one moment you're feeling a wave of grief and the next moment you are trying to control your anger right along with Paul, resisting the urge to take revenge too quickly. At times, the concepts of good and evil merge with the notion that maybe this really is just all politics, and then you begin to nurture the thought of watching it all go down in flames. An epic to remember for sure, and I cannot wait to move on to the next book.

I was alittle disappointed that Kelly Rowland kept pushing back her album date. At first I thought it would hurt her album sales; I was wrong. I was also disappointed that her singles kept bombing on the charts (Rose Colored Glasses and Commander were hot tracks!). I figured she had alot of international chart success, giving her some clout behind some of her former Destiny's Child Members. Well, Motivation was received surprisingly well--surprisingly heading up to 20 on the 100 chart. I was excited for the buzz building up for this album, and when I received it. I loved it! It's a really good album. The perfect blend of dance and rnb is the perfect fit for Ms. Rowland. I was alittle nervous that her dance album would be  akward for American Audiences, so her mixing both sounds fit perfectly. (Especially since alot of rnb artists are doing it nowadays). It's the best rnb album I've heard this summer, and I think she'll have alot of success with future singles.

At times I wanted to put the book down because I felt so bad for \\"intruding\\" on her life but as a mom, I thought that it would help me to look out for my own kids. I bought the book in the first place because I wanted to support Jaycee. What an amazing, inspiring lady that we can all learn from. May she always know that there are lots of people that look up to her through the ups and downs of her life. Thank you Jaycee!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|If a radio station streams on the web anywhere in the world, you can get it with this marvelous app.  In addition to local stations, TuneIn Radio Pro allows me to listen to the BBC, (any fans of British comedy out there?) Radio Deutche Welle, and the CBC.  It handles wma mp3 and AAC streams flawlessly.<br /><br />I used the record function for the first time this week.  I was listening to a show I really wanted to hear, and I was interrupted.  I was able to listen to the program an hour later with no problem.  I am a fan!!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I have been a fan of \\"Starwars\\" since I was 7yrs old! And I love the original Theatricle release, and the remastered (non-Special ed)version... But I must admit to being very dissapointed in George Lucas's refusal to release a Blue ray with both the original theatrical release as well as the new re-invisioned ver... I like watching the Original story where Han shoots first - Hello! Scoundrel!! not exactly a law-abiding, rule following guy... thats what made his change and growth so great!    I like the option to watch the version I like, not have it force'd down my throat!! Till George Lucas comes around on Star Wars like the Blu-Ray of BladeRunner finally did, I'll stick with my DVD and VHS versions!     Disappointing!!!
B004WPYNY8|3.0|Often with established artists I tend to judge their latest works against their earlier works and so with this latest album, Symphony X has quite a reputation to live up to given some incredible albums they've released in the past.<br /><br />I, like some of other reviewers of this album thought Symphony X's best album was the new Mythology Suite album which blended many different types of music seamlessly to produce what I think is their finest effort. While the Odyssey was also very good, I thought it was a slight step down in quality and Paradise yet another step down from that. I don't know that I consider Iconoclast a step down from Paradise, but I do think it's roughly the same quality of music. There's a slight shift here and there to mix up the style of music on this album, but it largely follows the trend set in Paradise for a darker, heavier metal sound and less of the symphonic type/prog pieces playing a prominent role in their music.<br /><br />This isn't necessarily a bad thing as I don't want a rehashed New Mythology suite every so often, but the dynamic creativity found in new Mythology just isn't as present in this latest offering as it was in previous works.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy the album and it did sound a bit \\"fresher\\" than Paradise did to me when I first purchased that album, though after many listens I'm not convinced they're all that different in terms of overall quality. I'd recommend this to anyone who's a big fan of Symphony X already, or just progressive-influenced music that gravitates towards metal with a hint of classical here and there.
0307477479|2.0|After finally finishing Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Good Squad, I felt as if I had been worked over by a team of bat-wielding thugs.  Yes, it was that difficult to finish this husk of a novel.  The author is clearly a gifted, even inspired, writer but, she missed one opportunity after another to help me connect to any of her many characters. For all the author's strained use of footnotes and Powepoint slides,there is nothing innovative here. I guess this is what a novel cool looks like when stripped of all fully developed endearing (or repellent) character.     After turning the last page and flipping the now tattered paperback--tattered not from long wear or use but from having been flung across my living room, my bedroom and an airport departure gate out of sheer frustration--I sat to write this review.  As cognitive dissonance set in to justify why I had spent so many hours out of my brief life to finish this book, I looked at the cover of the book where I again espied the gold disc on in which is written \\"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize.\\"  Like many readers, I took the Pulitzer's recognition as a mark of some assured minimal level of literary excellence or basic readability.  It is only now that I recall that the Pulitzer, unlike its British analogue, the Man Booker Prize, does not reward the finest fiction.  Rather, the Pulitzer is awarded to recognize \\"distinguished\\" works of fiction by an American author.        I could forgive the disjointed, almost imperceptible or non-existent character development and forced efforts at edginess made by the author in the span of the sometimes vacuous short stories that comprise this so-called novel.  While there were a few memorable literary flourishes, the book is most memorable or \\"distinguished\\" for its breathtaking leaps over chasms of time and unplumbed depths of un- or- underdeveloped characters.  I made not a single emotional connection to any of the myriad of characters that streaked through the pages of this book. So superficial was the author's development of the characters that when their various flaws and weaknesses were served up to us it was received with the alienating shock that defines pornography rather than the contemplation that trails the revelation of the inherent weakness of human beings.  Goon Squad managed to make suicide painless and pointless.      And, the defining chapter presented in slides, has all the resonance of any power-pointless presentation I've ever had to endure.  If the aim of the author was for me to forget the novel like any of the many text messages I received yesterday, the novel is a resounding success.  If this novel is a commentary on the state of American life and the future trajectory of its literature, I'm LMFAO.

B004UFEJS0|5.0|Ratatouille is a wonderful film about discovering who you are and follow your dreams no matter where you come from. As with every Pixar production, the animation is superb, the characters are compelling and the story resound with everyone. Also, the humor is great.<br /><br />Remy is a rat that dreams to become a chef and his opportunity comes when he meets Linguini, a garbage boy who wants to keep his job. Together, they become the finest chef in France but problems arise in the restaurant and with Remy's family that can jeopardize the whole scheme. I have to say that the best character is Linguini, it's obvious that the animators had a blast animating him because it's so funny and all his mannerisms are executed spectacularly. Themes like family, friendship, passion and more are the core of the film and everything is enveloped in a beautiful score by the great Michael Giacchino. The animation is a sight to behold. Paris looks so beautifully breathtaking and the food looks so deliciously real that you will get real hungry while watching the film. Ratatouille is Pixar's 8th triumph and one they should be very proud about. A wonderful film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Ratatouille comes to BD looking absolutely fantastic. This is hardly a surprise being a Pixar film but still the transfer mesmerize. Colors jump off the screen, detail and contrast are terrific and no compression artifacts whatsoever. Simply amazing.<br /><br />The 5.1 uncompressed audio is also amazing with fidelity and clarity beyond your expectations. Spectacular.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br />Ratatouille comes with a nice assortment of bonus features although is not as loaded as other Pixar films. First you have a documentary \\"Fine food and Film\\" which is a conversation with director Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller. It's a fantastic piece where you learn how they chose their careers and how passionate they are about it. You have two great shorts \\"Lifted\\" and \\"Your Friend the Rat\\". You also have making of featurettes that deals with all the aspects of the production of the film including story, characters, music, design and more. You also have a gallery, a game, publicity material and deleted scenes.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />Ratatouille is another Pixar Triumph that everyone should see and own.

030788743X|5.0|It's not often that I read a book that makes me as happy to read as this one did. I had a ton of fun blazing through this book and will certainly read it again.    The characters are great, the plot is one of the best I've ever read, and the elements of the story make me remember back to when *I* was a kid. (I was born in 1972 and can relate to most of the stuff in this book pretty directly.)    The story is an Homage to the 80s geek that I *highly* recommend to anyone that enjoys reading-- if you've got a bit of interest in video games, 80s pop culture, anime, or any of a host of 80s themed topics, you'll love this book.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Clint Eastwood had an idea when he filmed Hereafter; instead of cutting the parts of a story where nothing happens and showing the parts where something happens, he would do the reverse; the result sucked. It sucked like my life minus all the good parts.  I was thinking about bad reviews I would write halfway through the movie. In this respect, the movie was inspirational.  I think I did good, much better than I would have had the movie been any good...at all.  I'm watching the last part right now.  Guess what?  It's freakin' boring.      I'll give it this.  This movie is great for contemplating things that are not this movie.  Like Mario.  I have this weird itch to play Mario, and I don't play video games.  Isn't that weird? And wow!  As I write this, the film introduces a character named Yoshi. No joke!  Does the film want me to play Mario??  Is this the point?  Is it like subliminal?  Does Clint Eastwood have a contract with Nintendo?  If you slow the film down enough, will we see freeze frames of Mario doing cool stuff?  Will freeze frames show Clint Eastwood being all like \\"play Nintendo\\"? Is there such a thing as too many consecutive rhetorical questions?  If you watch this film, you'll be thinking things like this.  And more.  But they will be your thoughts, because you have your own mind.  For example, my girlfriend was telling me how badly this film needs Betty White.  These were her thoughts.  Make some of your own. My response, by the way, was to say how badly this film needs not to suck.  You too can have such conversations with your friends about this movie.  Except of course, you will rarely actually talk about this movie.  My girl and I, for example, got into long tangent about the merits of The Golden Girls.  As I said, this movie is great for stimulating discussion and lively talk about things that are not this movie.  You, of course, need not talk about the Golden Girls.  You can speak of things that interest you.  You can reconnect with old friends, play truth or dare, or reconcile old differences that once got between you. You might even make a friend, develop a deep connection, get into a fight, and lose the friendship all while this movie is playing. It's pretty long.  And boring.  You can watch it in groups so you watch the drama unfold amongst the audience. (By the way, this movie is still rolling.)    I'm starting to hum little songs in my head now.  Maybe I'll take a nap.  I'm sure that you can daydream a little bit and tie up any loose ends I might have left open about the film.  Matt Daemon is in it.  Maybe that helps.  He sucks in it too.  But at least you know he's in it.  Some chick from Spider Man is in it.  I'm doing this to tell you a little about the movie, since it's a review.  The guy from Sopranos who became a cook is here.  He plays a cook.  Someone said that was the best part...the part where he cooks.  He might be right. My sentences are too short.  Oh, the movie is also kind of about death, psychic powers, and has French people.  Spoiler alert, in the end, nothing happens.  Okay I'm off.  It's time for you to watch for yourself and dream your own dreams.  While you sleep.  Through the movie.
0060589280|1.0|I cannot comprehend what is great about this author or his books. All I can read is big words and even bigger lack of knowledge of human soul. He attempts to be poetic but his attempts are so clumzy I cannot feel anything but sorry for him. In this novel Coelho reveals total ignorance about spiritual and erotic life of a woman. The plot is boring. The main character is simply weak and uninteresting. This book bored me to death.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|How disappointing!  I waited and waited for this to finally come out, missed it in the theater due to its limited release and finally saw it on DVD the other night.  I was excited because it started strong but then it sadly went downhill very quickly.  There was little character development and even though I love the book, I could hardly wait for the movie to end.  The acting was superb but the adaptation was so weak the excellent acting could not even carry the story. Their love story just \\"happened\\" w/o any solid foundation or motivation.  So much so that if you didn't already know the story, you would have found it laughable.  I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that perhaps this story isn't meant for the big screen.  It can be dark and complex....very difficult to translate into a movie although there have been several adaptations that did a much better job of it than this movie(Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens version).  I'm sure Judi Dench was appalled to be identified with such dismal writing and/or editing.  Save your money and read the book instead. My poor husband sat through the full two hours with me!  What a guy!
B001LF347E|5.0|I really like the atmospheric and detailed settings of this series.  It will really transport you and help you to immerse yourself in the premise and engage you in the story.  I find the character of Merlin himself a little difficult to believe but that's a minor issue (my wishing maybe a different actor played the part).  The show seems pointed at young adults in their 20s but has serious themes and although mostly PG, does veer into PG13 territory at times.  I really like the character of King Uther, who really does make tough decisions that seem wrong but when placed in context of his duty to the kingdom, seem totally appropriate (here I disagree with others who would love nothing more than to see this character get killed off).  The music is excellent.  True the special effects aren't so good at times, showing a limited budget for digital animation.  But if less money there means a lower budget and possibly a longer life for this series (although I believe it is planned for a total of 5 seasons) then I'm all for that.  Enjoy without hesitation.
B001FFBI82|5.0|This movie isn't as bad or bad at all as some are saying. It's actually a great movie. Don't get discouraged from buying it because of some of the reviews here. Everyone likes different things, you might like it.
1935670913|1.0|Locke's book was sophomoric and worthless.  It provided no useful info on how to self-publish via outlets like Amazon, e.g., how to set up an account in Amazon, etc.    Lots of ego, lots of useless 'Management 101' suggestions (e.g., 'you must set up a Twitter account; 'you must have a business plan.'), but nothing unique or useful.    EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.
B005EI86JU|3.0|This will be a good pocket reference for when I just can't remember what that setting means or accomplishes.  Too few pictures of quality that show the difference in choosing one setting over another.  \\"My Recommendations\\" is a good bit.  I often just skimmed and just read that part.    Often the numbers on the images pointing to buttons and controls did not line up with the legends.  Very confusing and in some cases, useless.    Has basically NO photography value whatsoever.  Just the D7000 menus and settings in a clear and understandable presentation.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Love, love, love this show...they've finally solved all the problems that plauge your favourite show.  Dead leading character?  No problem; we'll just bring them back to life. Implausable story line? A demon did it!  The twists and turns in the story lines keep you hooked, the boys are as hot as ever....could only be improved if they filmed the occasional show without thier shirts on.....which they do!  Love it! :)
B004WESFZW|3.0|This film I wanted to watch with no beforehand knowledge whatever, other than the title and that the leading player was Matt Damon .  I had read nothing about it and guessed, at first, that it might be another Bourne-like actioner.  Within a few minutes I began to get an inkling of what it was and it was the music that tipped me off.  Having the qualities of being a generally well-made film, I was initially  intrigued, but as the story unfolded I became less and less impressed.  Before the credit roll I had a suspicion that it might be something by Philip K. Dick.      I have for most of my life had an interest in science-fiction and read a lot of it when I was younger, but there have always been some aspects of it that I simply cannot buy.  In \\"The Minority Report ,\\" Dick asks us to entertain the existence of pre-destination on which the entire story hinges.  In this one, what with the \\"Chairman\\" and the \\"Plan,\\" he wants us to accept the ideas of pre-destination and gods or God -- two concepts that I cannot accept as  story vehicles.  It's understandable that I would personally find the payoff of the story unsatisfying, but I can understand how some folks would like  it.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|My grandsons, aged 7 and 4, were born in the Arizona Desert and lived here until this year when they moved to Kentucky. I saw this film and thought it would be a perfect way of reminding the boys of their roots. They absolutely loved it! The desert critters were so well done. The animation was fine, the characters were amusing and the plot was child friendly. There was just enough threat to our lizard hero to keep the boys interested. Johnny Depp's voice was perfect for the little beasty. I would recommend the DVD for both boys and girls and it was well worth the price.
B004MARLJ2|4.0|Got this as the free app of the day.  Went through the tutorial and thought I got it.  However, when the real game play started I was thoroughly confused.  It could be because I have children, and one of the symptoms of children is fatigue, but I couldn&apos;t keep trying.  \nOtherwise it&apos;s super cute and seems like lots of fun once you get it.
0553801473|1.0|Little to add to the many negative reviews above.<br /><br />I am a fan, I waited effectively ten years for this to turn up and it really sucked to the point that I just can't avoid comparisons with the other great disappointment of my geek generation's life - the Star Wars prequels.<br /><br />The let down is almost exactly the same - its set in the same universe, the names are the same but everything is wrong as if some utterly inept doppelganger had taken over.<br /><br />With Lucas the reasons are obvious - in the first three SW (well the first two anyway, Revenge of the Jedi shows the rot already setting in) he worked as part of a whole creative team with above all professional writers who were willing to tell him when he was wrong - the prequels are just pure George and show that while he can produce and cut merchandising deals like hell he can neither write nor direct.<br /><br />I wonder if with Martin the same factors are in play - remarkably for a book so long in the writing it does not appear to have been edited at all - as if now he is such a succcessful writer no one dares tell him that he's produced not one but two fat and bloated volumes that scarcely advance the plot or develop any characters (other than ones who should never have played more than bit parts anyway) since the end of A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Well although reasonably enough he claims to not care about amazon reviews this does give us an opportunity to tell him the truth - going from four and a half to three stars or worse hurts sales - and if you hurt sales maybe the publishers  and HBO (whose show runners must be asking themselves WTF they are going to do with the last two volumes if they ever get that far) will tell him to get a grip.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|While this movie was not nearly as bad as some of the reviews said, it was a huge disappointment. And maybe that's where the problem lies. I am a huge comic fan and have been a GL fan for longer than most of the people that were in the theater with have been alive. I expected an incredible epic tale and I got a cookie cutter movie with lots of eye candy. The most severe crime was in the complete waste of potential and great characters such as Sinestro and Kilawog. The way they were written it wouldn't have mattered if they were left out completely. Maybe that would have actually been better than the tease of their inclusion. Bottom line - in a genre where I expect to ignore reality and suspend my perceptions of reality the story and was extremely weak and under developed. (Batman Forever had a more cohesive plot.) That being said, Ryan Reynolds did a great job of bringing Green Lantern to life and made the movie imminently more watchable than it could have been (even though his portrayal was more Kyle Raynor than Hal Jordan). I have heard that there is a longer cut of this movie which might go a ways to improving the pacing and fill in the gaps to make the story more interesting - much like the Daredevil Director's cut was far better than the theatrical version. I'll wait and see. As of now I can't go beyond 3 of 5 stars.
B003Y5H574|4.0|As comedies go, I think this is probably one of the better ones you will see this year.<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Cal, a husband who splits from his high school sweetheart, played by Julianne Moore, after she cheats.  Hanging out in single bars every nights he sees this ladies man played by Ryan Gosling successfully pick up numerous women, while he says out loud to anyone who will listen, 'my wife cheated on me with xxxx.'<br /><br />Meanwhile his teenage son has the hots for his babysitter, while the babysitter crushes on Cal. We have 4 romantic triangles between the main characters, that are developed to great comic effect.<br /><br />So, Ryan Gosling's character takes him under his wing, as his wing man, and shows him how to score with the ladies, which leads to many interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />There were several parts of this movie that made me cringe, one was the patheticness of the character played by Steve Carell.  The teenage crush made me cringe a little, especially with the absurd things this kid did to get her attention.<br /><br />In fairness this was more than balanced with some high quality scenes and interactions, particularly the scenes with Marisa Tomei, who I thought was absolutely brilliant, especially when her simmering emotions boil over at the parent teacher meeting.<br /><br />The Dirty Dancing routine between  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was simply movie magic, and one of the best scenes I have seen all year, two quality actors, chemistry, everything, perfect.<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion that Ryan Gosling may be one the best actors on the planet.  You probably know him from The Notebook, a perennial top 100 rental on leading dvd rental sites.  He has studously avoided the mainstream doing indie and art house movies.  Watching his performance in [[ASIN:B004R170M4 Blue Valentine]] with Michelle Williams convinced me of his greatness, with some reminders of a young DeNiro, without the psychotic overtones, or even perhaps Sean Penn, the most respected actor among his peers.<br /><br />The proof may not be out there yet, and I am so glad to see him to see him in a mainstream movie.  I hope that he will continue to make critically acclaimed movies and also more widely seen movies, and that he will get both the recognition, and ultimately the accolades he deserves.<br /><br />Emma Stone, what can you say, she is the best of the young actresses who has emerged over the last two years, outstanding in [[ASIN:B0036TGSIK Easy A]], and now the lead in The Help, for which she may get an Oscar nom.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful, and I think the movie is worth seeing.s.

It is truly astounding that she seems neither bitter nor angry. She has simply chosen not to let this man steal one more day from her. Her courage and her strength are amazing. There is something for each of us to learn from this amazing young woman.
B000UPSKO8|4.0|As a result of HD transmission and DVD's opera has reached a flexion point.  It is no longer enough for an opera star  to just stand and sing.   She must be able to emote creditably and in many parts to be a trained dancer.    Anna Netrebko illustrates this flexion point.   She and the technology reinforce each other.   I will watch and listen to this DVD many, many  times.

B003NS0PT2|5.0|The relationship between Walt and Jesse is my favorite of any in the series and this episode is entirely focused on the two of them which makes it a joy.  The underlying concern that each displays for the other is portrayed in a humorous and, to my mind, very suspenseful way.  Jesse and \\"Mr. White\\" have essentially become one anothers' \\"family,\\" and they're both feeling around the edges of that reality.  It's hard to fathom the guilt Walt must feel for his role in Jane's death and I fear that if Jesse knew the whole truth it might take him a very long time to forgive.  But, somehow, I get the sense that forgive he would.  I cheer in my secret heart for Jesse to one day see himself as the \\"good guy\\" and for Walt to know he had a hand in that transformation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book because it was recommended to me as a good read. Something I could open up my kindle and enjoy. The beginning to me was a little slow, it took me a while because I'd put the book down a lot. But when I got to the part where the actual Games started, I couldn't put the book down. Halfway through this book I was already getting things set up to buy the second and third in the trilogy. I liked the characters and the stories. It's very believable, to show what someone to do to get what is needed for their family.      I just started my college classes again and my Composition II instructor informed us that we'll be reading the Hunger Games. Only the first, and since I'm in the middle of reading Catching Fire, I'm gonna have to refresh my memory a bit and take notes on my Kindle from Hunger Games.   I'm also excited about the movie portrayal coming out.     ~Seleste
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Where are the Winchester's when you need them? After starting with Season 1 late last year, I recently just finished watching the final episode of Season 5 of the TV series [[ASIN:B001ECQ4AS Supernatural]]. In that series Sam and Dean Winchester are experts at fighting ghosts, demons and an array of supernatural phenomenon. While watching Insidious last night I thought to myself that the only thing missing from the movie was the Winchesters bursting through the door to save the day.<br /><br />Like Supernatural, Insidious is well done and has its creepy and genuinely scary moments. I knew that Director James Wan ([[ASIN:B000EWBKLC Saw]]) wouldn't let me down in that department. Look for Wan's ode to Saw with a little drawing of the Jigsaw puppet subtly placed in the middle of Insidious. But give me Supernatural any day versus what ended up being a little predictable and silly with Insidious. The family in Insidious seems to be clear that something unnatural is going on in their house early on in the film. But do you think that stops anyone from going up to the creepy attic to investigate a strange noise in the big spooky house? Of course not.<br /><br />I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family in [[ASIN:B000VD5I8U The Amityville Horror]] for staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries \\"GET OUT\\". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Insidious, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house...just like in 2009's [[ASIN:B002VKE0XA Paranormal Activity]]...so it makes it a little tough to simply get out I guess.<br /><br />There are some good scares in Insidious....Not just jump out the dark, disturbing image accompanied by a loud bang scares either. But it all seemed a little familiar to me. Perhaps if my skin wasn't so thick these days to ghost stories due to my addiction to Supernatural I'd have been affected a bit more by the movie.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that you'll get some nice chills with Insidious. Give it a try if you're into the genre. And definitely give Supernatural a look if you haven't before; the first three seasons were terrific.ovie.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that you'll get some nice chills with Insidious.

1593272839|4.0|I have very little to add that others haven't already. This is a very nice introduction to the basics of Haskell, an excursion the silliness of which belies, pleasantly, the subtlety of some of the topics covered. Although the formats differ, tonally this reminds me of The Little Schemer (replace references to 2001 with references to the Fonz) -- a book as well loved as I hope *this* one could become.    Criticisms: maybe I'm asking too much from an introduction, but it really *is* rather basic; someone who finishes this book still has a ways to go before she's developing non-trivial Haskell programs. There's a bit of unevenness, and some of the chapters are long enough that they begin to drag -- the book might profit from some reorganization. But these are minor things. Looking at it another way, this book is worth a read for the many clever and well-crafted illustrations. That it succeeds in teaching introductory Haskell is pure bonus.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|There was a lot to like about this keyboard but in the end the auto correct had so many issues that it made the keyboard more effort than it saved. They badly need to implement the ability to turn off their auto correct.
B0033780Y0|2.0|I'm a queen fan, the first 4 or 5 albums I felt were quite groundbreaking and Mercury was a pivotal influence. However this book didn't give me any insight into who this person was, it felt like Freddie lived a life of the perennial teenager with no real depth of emotion or intelligence which I'm sure was far from the truth.<br />The details of what curtains he liked or the fact he loved old movies was dull, no real mention was made of how he worked or a hint of any belief structure made this a disappointing read.
B004C5M282|5.0|A great album with lots of catchy songs!  There isn't a single song that I don't like, which is saying something.  The whole album is very fun and is great to listen to in the car.  My favorite tracks are The Mirror And The Ripper, Heaven Nor Hell, 16 Dollars, and A Warrior's Call.  Definitely give it a listen!

1400052173|5.0|Henrietta was a poor black woman living outside Baltimore at the time she discovered she had terminal cancer in 1951. When one of her doctors was able to keep her cancer cells (now known as HeLa cells) alive and growing indefinitely in the laboratory, it was one of the most important discoveries of modern oncology. But who was this woman who had unknowingly contributed so much to science at the moment of her death? Skloot expertly uncovers the mystery of the face behind the cells.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This film depicts a frightening and confused time in our history.  The characters played their parts with a passion one does not see in all period pieces.  Someone told me the studios did not want this film made; if this is true then I applaud Mr. Robert Redford and a cast outstanding thespians for taking up the veil.    Robin Wright and James Mcavoy are absolutely deserving of Oscars for their performances.
B004Y1USRG|4.0|Since Yes's last album of 2001 it seems like prog fans have been reduced to The Mars Volta and the occasional release from Rush.  Those are awesome choices, but it would have been nice to have seen Yes continue their long career in prog alongside the dwindling stable of acts.  I welcome this new album, and I think in the overall context of prog music it is truly an awesome album.  Now, if the only prog you listen to is Yes and you want to stack this up against other Yes albums, well, that's going to be tough.  This album sounds completely different from any other Yes album.  Naturally it sounds most similar to Drama, but even from this there are huge differences, the most obvious of which is that Drama was intense \\"pedal to the metal\\" type of playing (remember Tempus Fugit?), while Fly From Here has a very laid back almost Steely Dan type of sound.  Benoit's voice is silky and sounds great, but is not the least bit powerful (what can you say, not everyone has a powerful voice). Even Alan's signature rifle-shot snare is pared down to a softer \\"whap\\". But it is still very progressive in a way that prog fans should welcome.  I think this album stands up very well in the larger context of prog music, but if you are inexperienced or don't care for prog besides Yes, it might be a disappointment.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout dvd with Jillian Michaels is a definite killer. My entire body was sore for weeks. You will definitely shred inches.
B000VA51OE|5.0|I usually make a point of reading the \\"minority report\\" reviews to try to get a balanced perspective before spending hard-earned money on any performance, either on CD or download.     In this instance I have to agree with the majority: these performances absolutely sparkle--the concertos are played with all the wit, enthusiasm, tenderness and bravado that they deserve by two top-tier masters ... has Krystian Zimerman ever played better? And Maestro Boulez distinguishes himself (in a career already marked with outstanding achievements), coaxing a finely balanced and passionate performance from both orchestras in music that they have undoubtedly played many times. If \\"familiarity breeds contempt\\" (or at least a life-less performance) you won't hear it here: the music sounds \\"new\\" to my ears and fresh as the day of first hearing.     Finally, the DG engineers did a superlative job, giving the recording a live, natural, full-spectrum sound that equals or surpasses any performance I've heard (and there have been many) and also sounds good on any playback device. I do recommend at least one hearing with earphones: you will be delighted to hear details that you might otherwise miss. I've read elsewhere a concern expressed about the quality of DG's MP3 files (inferior bit rate, etc.), and this concern kept me from purchasing the downloadable version earlier. Upon initial inspection and several auditions on various playback equipment, I can \\"hear\\" no reason for concern, at least if purchased from Amazon. I won't let that stop me down in the future.    Are these performances \\"perfect\\"? I'm sure the answer is \\"no\\" but it's hard to imagine what's missing. Are there other recordings worthy of your time and money? OF COURSE there are, and (if you are so inclined) the most notable are already mentioned in the other reviews, so read on. Some of these are also sadly apparently unavailable ... my first exposure to the Ravel G Major Concerto was in college (1973) with an RCA \\"budgetrelease\\" featuring the Boston Symphony Orchestra with maestro Charles Munch and soloist Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer, and the \\"B\\" side was the Prokofiev 2nd Concerto in G minor: what a revelation! Because of this recording both concertos immediately rocketed to the \\"top 5 favorites\\" spot in my short list, and have stayed there ever since. I lost the LP years ago in one of my many moves, but these performances, by two French masters steeped in the performance tradition, helped to \\"set the standard\\" for what I listen for in modern recordings of these works.     Rant: I would love to hear these recordings again, at least partly to see if the reality of these performances merit the exalted position that memory has given them. Can anyone tell me why ANY recording of any work or performance can't be stored somewhere on the web in a high-quality MP3 for the benefit of historians and old-timers? (Rant over).    Bottom line: enjoy the music! If you're a music lover simply wanting to add these wonderful works to your collection, this really is the only recording you will ever need. If you already own one or more performances of any of these works, I believe you will find something new here and will enjoy repeated hearings of these outstanding recordings. For the G Major Concerto I personally plan on archiving everything except the Michelangeli. This was money well spent.    P.S. This is my first review on Amazon and I can think of only one other recording where I have something to say. I find Amazon's reviews extremely helpful and want to say thanks to all who are willing to share their evaluations. You've helped me make some wise choices.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|\\"Friends with Benefits\\" has a lightning fast, very smart script, it moves like a limousine, and it features another stunningly moving character turn by Richard Jenkins. It's good enough that it revives hope for that troubled genre, the Romantic Comedy. It's worth seeing, more than once.<br /><br />\\"Friends with Benefits\\" surprised me. I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is famous - what is remarkable about him, really? - and Mila Kunis does nothing for me. We live in the age of decline of the Romantic Comedy. \\"Friends with Benefits\\" was not the forgettable, rote, mass-produced studio product I expected. It was actually really good.<br /><br />\\"Friends with Benefits\\" began really fast, and I found myself bobbing along on the script's energy. I noticed how much I was enjoying it and I kept waiting for the film to drop the ball, to let me down, to betray itself, to fall into predictable clich&eacute;d traps. That didn't happen for quite a while, and the film's failings were slow in coming, minor, and didn't ruin the film.<br /><br />What \\"Friends with Benefits\\" does right it does very, very right. The script is amazing. There are jokes that you'd need some literacy and maturity to understand. They fly right by, no pause for the viewer to laugh, or to google the references, before the next one-liner or trenchant observation rolls down the chute. Our culture has been so dumbed down that hearing a joke that one would have to have some knowledge of history or culture or even just the front page of the newspaper to understand amazed and gratified me.<br /><br />The movie's strong point is that it is so fast; that's also a bit of a weak point. Legendary director Frank Capra said that \\"sometimes your story has to stop and you just let your audience look at your people. You want your audience to like them...these scenes are quite important to a film. When the audience rests and they look at the people, they begin to smile.\\" \\"Friends with Benefits\\" is so frenetic, it never creates a memorable screen moment where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin.<br /><br />Richard Jenkins works some powerful mojo. He's a character actor, older, bland-looking and bald, but in every movie I've seen him in lately, especially so in \\"Eat Pray Love,\\" he seems to be visiting from a different, better movie, and I want, after the movie I'm watching is over, to watch the superior film from which Jenkins has visited. In \\"Friends with Benefits\\" Jenkins plays Dylan's father who is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's. He is funny, profound, arresting and truly lovable. What is Jenkins doing? Whatever it is, more actors should do it.<br /><br />Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Nolan Gould and Masi Oka are all very, very good in supporting roles. Clarkson, as Jamie's mother, delivers a liner about Jamie's father that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"Friends with Benefits\\" looks like too many other, lesser movies. It's not. It's a really good, worthwhile film.where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin.

0316067938|3.0|I read the previous reviews regarding Breaking Dawn after I ordered the book (I am a twi-hard after all) and I immediately panicked.  Would the book forever destroy my love of Twilight?  I should confess right here and now that this is the first of her books I have actually read, being introduced to the saga through the films.   Already 2/3rds through Breaking Dawn and relieved to say that although I appreciate the previous reviewers grievances, - I am still fully caught up in the story and just as engrossed as I have been in the previous 3 films.  Perhaps being able to so clearly visualize my favorite characters has assisted with this?  .....as previously stated, not having read her previous books (although having read the Amazon reviews of Breaking Dawn, I am curious to see if they are any better) I can confidently state that Breaking Dawn is no literary feat....just a jolly good yarn.  There is no doubt Stephanie Meyer can tell a tale.  Very like reading the conscious stream of a tall-tale-telling teenager who is desperate to be transported in romantic love and and generally admired and adored by the whole world, and of-course... hormonally overstimulated ...nothing really ground breaking there.  So regardless, if like me, you were 'turned' by the films and just can't wait till the next two cinema installments to find out what happens to Bella Edward Jake and the gang, then go ahead. Just make sure you have the cinema versions bevy of beautiful faces in your head - it will help ease the gaps and smooth the bumps - no pun intended.   Oh- and naturally don't forget to suspend all disbelief (and be forgiving of the narrative - particularly the descriptive) as you go, after all isn't that the first commandment of a book of this genre?
B003Y5H574|5.0|\\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying.<br /><br />Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to \\"stop talking.\\" When she keeps talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene.<br /><br />I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that made me look twice. \\"The Notebook\\" was one of the blandest and most forgettable movies I've ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too hard.<br /><br />Gosling's Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest, subtlest performances I've ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, \\"Do you want to get out of here?\\" Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha male, as if he were a silverback gorilla - or Frank Sinatra - even while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He's Buddy Love on steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film - and I did not - I'd watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it.<br /><br />Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie's love, but it never did - in fact it got a little weird - and I liked that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love.<br /><br />There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams and plans smashed - and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside of participants' hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light. This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its best. Steve Carrel could not be better in this scene.capable of that kind of love.

037571457X|4.0|This book was beautiful. Beautifully drawn, beautifully written, and beautifully lived. The simple cartoons and dialogue make the confusing and multi-faceted story and events that shape it both conceivable and real. As some one who knew very little about this conflict and certainly never knew some one who'd lived through it, this was eye-opening in more ways than one. It gave me new perspectives on things I would never have thought twice about otherwise. And the most amazing part is that as dramatic and frightening and real the story is to the reader, one can only imagine how much more so it must have been for the author who really lived through it. She, like all the others who fought for their independence, is truly heroic.

0439023483|3.0|I read the book at a friends suggestion and i found the book to be a bit of a catch 22. It's fun but dull at the same time, great setup and premise but emotionally hollow, action driven yet quite actionless.<br /><br />the problem with the characters is that they feel pretty flat with no real substance to them.  The emotions feel forced or hollow and all though the main character was likeable enough she is not really enjoyable to read as almost all her internal dialuge(which you spend most of the book reading) and emotions turn out to be either angery, aggressive and negative or glass-half-empty, pessimistic and depressed. She always finds a cloud in the silver lining.<br /><br />Also it's a catch 22 in that it's hard to put down and a fun page turner but has many dull parts.  Even the last half when the games are taking place, the action only occures in small short bits with most of the games spent listening to the pessimistic thoughts of the main character dragging the book out and slowing down the pace to being almost dull.<br /><br />All in all I'd suggest you give it a try as it is a pretty good book and an easy read but it leaves you wanting the book to be a bit more, have more substance and shifting from 3rd gear to overdrive which never really happens.
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|When this album was a big deal I didn't even know it existed. Our first child took up any music time that used to be. Now she's in graduate school and the Stone Roses play around here quite a bit. Even being from another time and another place this music is powerful stuff. This remastered edition is the straight record with one bonus track--Fool's Gold. Granted, the Deluxe version has an extra disc of recordings and a 3rd disc dvd of their famous concert. Much more fun I'm sure. Lately though, I've purchased a couple of remasters without all the bonus historical theater and been quite happy with a better version of the album. As far as being \\"the greatest album of all time\\" (NME) I personally don't think that recording is here yet, but it is thoroughly amazing. I love listening and dancing with it--it chases away all the geezeritis--for a while. Then I put it on again. Fool's Gold was made for dancing.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|Honestly this book was a little slow to begin with.

B004XQO90E|4.0|I'm a sucker for high concept movie ideas, and Source Code has a great one. A soldier must relive the last 8 minutes of a train crash over and over until he figures out who planted the bomb. Whenever he \\"dies\\", he finds himself in a high tech capsule in some military installation, where his superiors drive him to \\"try harder next time.\\" The only problem is, the soldier (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) doesn't know why he's here, or how to go about doing his duty. The last thing he remembers is crashing his helicopter in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The movie is great at reinventing ways to play the same scene over and over. Red herrings abound, and some threads are never resolved. All the while, the folks playing with this \\"Source Code\\" device are running out of time, and Gyllenhaal is discovering a few things about himself that maybe he didn't want to know.<br /><br />It's as least as much fun to wonder what you would do in this situation, as it is to watch what Jake's character is actually doing. He uses quite a bit of brute force in his methods, which leads to some fun and tense action scenes. He's helped along by a company of bizarre train mates, every one of whom looks or acts suspicious. When he finally zeroes in on the real killer, it leaves us wondering just what all those other folks are up to.<br /><br />The movie is short, around 90 minutes, and the length feels about right for this concept. It even explores some deeper territory near the end, as Jake wonders how much of his future he can really control. It's definitely a darker take on the Groundhog Day concept, and the ending will likely leave you pondering over several questions.
0545259088|3.0|Great book, but very disappointing open-ended ending. After the last page I turned it again, expecting more, or an epilogue, something, only to discover it was the end. I was all \\"wait..that's it and now it is over, forever..\\"<br />When I get hooked on a series, I need closure at the end to let it go.<br />This was like an ellipse.<br /><br />but still a good book.<br /><br />Shiver is still the best. It was so good I felt sad reading the others. Of course I was also 2 years younger then

0307477479|3.0|I was interested in this book just enough to get through it, but it was a tough read at times. The characters do not resemble actual human beings, and their dialogue reflects this. This would not be so bad if there was a consistent tone throughout the book; then I may have become wrapped up in the world being presented and fell into its pattern.     The originality was found in its characters' various situations. I don't read many books that present the escapades of a PR agent for a dictator alongside a dying man receiving his family. Their loose link was one of the obnoxious elements that has been praised as originality. Another was the need to change storytelling styles when it served no apparent purpose.     It worked as a somewhat-engaging collection of short stories, but its gimmicks could have been jettisoned for better stories. Toward the end, I lost track of who was who, and ultimately did not care.

Therefore, very little has any real \\"effect\\" on me when it comes to violence, gore, etc.  Dark Places, while the story itself isn't over-the-top, it is a rough read because of how well written & effective it is.  From beginning to end, the murder mystery kept me on my toes, always wondering and, even more important, always making me WANT to know what'll happen (vs. needing to know).      The author really delivers here with a solidly haunting novel worth the time of any mystery reader.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|My last computer was a Pentium D 3.4  For what I do, it was a very good rig, but at almost 6 years old, it was due for an update.  So I started from scratch and built \\"The Beast\\".  i7 2600K, 16 gigs DDR3, and all the bells & whistles.  This thing blows away my wildest dreams!  I have never had a computer (or seen one) that just does what you tell it to do- instantly.  No waiting!  Massive upgrade from what I had before.  I highly recomend this CPU- not only for the performance, but also the price.  The only chips that will out perform this one are the 1366 i7 extremes, and they are still at the $1000 price point!  BUY THIS PROCESSOR!  You won't be disappointed.  It just leaves me with one question- How much faster will CPUs be in the future?  In the last 5 or 6 years things have changed dramatically, so what will they be like in 5 or 6 more years.  This processor already does most anything faster than I ever thought possible.  If I had another chip today that was faster, I don't think I could tell the difference....instant is instant!
1400032717|4.0|This novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time written by Mark Haddon is a story about a teenage boy living in modern day England. This isn't your average book about the life of a teenage boy. This boy suffers from autism or so it seems. He can't stand the colors yellow or brown and refuses to eat any food that is that color unless he dyed it red. He takes A-Level math and loves science. Despite his intelligence he has no understanding of human emotion. This is a book written through the eyes of a boy with a very different condition and how he views society.   The book has several different themes. One theme would have to be understanding society. People in the novel do a lot of questionable things through the eyes of Christopher through the eyes of any normal civilian seem sensible.  Some things as easy to us as reading someone's face to see if they are happy or sad take us no more than seconds, but with Christopher's condition it may take him up to a few minutes.    The narrator, Christopher, always tells the truth no matter what it is. He is not a reliable narrator and can seem very naive at some points. Towards the middle of the book I got frustrated with him because he just didn't see the obvious or do something right because he didn't know what else to do.    At the beginning of the story Christopher discovers Wellington, the neibors dog, dead. His goal is to find out who killed it because he had really loved the dog. He goes all around town asking if anyone has seen anything. Due to his condition it is a long process being able to talk to people. It would be a boring book if it was told through a regular teenager's prospective, but since it is Christopher's it will take you on a long and surprising journey coming from a boy that has a hard time even touching people.

0553801473|4.0|But ultimately, the ride is worth it.  I enjoyed Dance with Dragons tremendously for its writing, and for connecting various strands of plot while leaving the reader wanting more.<br /><br />I have one major criticism, which is that the overall plot of the series does not advance much.  There's a ton of character development here, but little in the way of plot resolution.  Minor plot points are resolved, similar to what was done in Feast, but the big, overarching questions and problems were left largely in limbo until the next book.  I am starting to doubt that Martin can finish the series in 7 books, particularly if he continues at this glacial pace of plot advancement.<br /><br />But did I like Dance?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Yes.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" (Warner Bros., 1951) was director Elia Kazan's seventh film.<br /><br />A troubled Southern belle, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh), arrives in New Orleans to live with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter), and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando). The seemingly genteel and delicate Blanche is shocked by the decrepit state of her sister's French Quarter flat and by the brutish manners of her husband. She quickly latches onto one of Stanley's friends, the comparably well-mannered Mitch (Karl Malden), and sees in him a safe harbor in the storm. Stanley resents Blanche's intrusion and haughty demeanor and soon discovers the secrets of her sordid past, which he reveals to Mitch and Stella. Mitch rejects Blanche and she descends into madness. In a rousing climax to their game of \\"cat and mouse,\\" Stanley rapes Blanche and she is subsequently dispatched to a sanitarium.<br /><br />Elia Kazan directed Tennessee William's Pulitzer Prize-winning play on Broadway where it had a two-year run and adapted the play to film. Although a few scenes were shot on location in New Orleans, most of \\"Streetcar\\" was filmed in studio.<br /><br />Nominated for twelve Academy Awards, \\"Streetcar\\" won Best Actress (Leigh), Best Supporting Actress (Hunter) and Best Supporting Actor (Malden). Kazan had been nominated for Best Director and Brando for Best Actor. Although he didn't win an Oscar, Brando's performance was a stunning tour de force and revolutionized film acting. Jessica Tandy played the part of Blanche on Broadway but Leigh was brought aboard for the film version due to her draw power. Although Leigh won an Academy Award, her portrayal is a bit over-the-top. Malden is great and Hunter is okay. Alex North's jazzy score is wonderful. The cinematography is good but the viewer tires of seeing Leigh's fading beauty through a cheesecloth. Richard Day and George Hopkins deservedly won the Oscar for art direction.<br /><br />As an interesting aside, William's choice of a Polish American character for the role of the brutish brother-in-law was no accident. The working-class, \\"dumb Polak,\\" stereotype was quite prevalent throughout America in the 1950's and it would peak in the 1960's and 1970's. Surprisingly, Polish American academia has not addressed the \\"dumb Polak\\" phenomenon in a substantial way.<br /><br />This package contains two DVDs; one for the film and the other for special features. Commentary is provided by Rudy Behlmer, Jeff Young, and Karl Malden.  Very little of the commentary is devoted to scenes from the film, most is a discussion of the personalities involved with the play and film.<br /><br />Special features include: \\"Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey,\\" a wonderful 1995 documentary of the filmmaker narrated by Eli Wallach. Also included are five documentary shorts: A Streetcar on Broadway, A Streetcar in Hollywood, Censorship and Desire, North and the Music of the South, and An Actor Named Brando. These documentaries basically rehash the same information provided in the commentary but the clips of Karl Malden and Kim Hunter are priceless. Also included are film and audio outtakes and a Brando screen test. Censored by the film industry at the time of its initial theatrical release, this DVD presents \\"Streetcar\\" in its original version.<br /><br />\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is considered a cinematic milestone and is ranked # 45 on the American Film Institute's 1998 listing of the 100 Greatest American Films.

B005GIS23I|4.0|If you loved \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\", or if you're just a huge geek at heart...you'd be crazy to miss this movie. The special effects used to create Paul have been sorely undervalued; the character looks real enough to blend right in with the live actors. Raunchy, hilarious, and at times even heartfelt. Good, nerdy fun.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Sometimes when you're watching a TV series, you wonder if the concept simply wasn't good enough to become a movie... in this case, they couldn't fit all that goodness into a mere 2 hours, and so you have 6 artfully done episodes packed into season one. Based off of a comic book by the same title, AMC hosted this series, and prior to it's airing, it had a lot of underground hype... and for good reason!  I was worried that being on a station like AMC, that The Walking Dead would go unnoticed, but I was surprised by just how many of my friends were raving about this series while it was on the air at the time.<br /><br />I have to admit that my husband is a \\"zombie fan\\", me, not so much. I have been dragged into watching many a zombie movie, some better than others.  However, this series was one that I could really sink my teeth into! Excuse the pun. For my husband, the series had everything he wanted, scary zombies leaving you on the edge of your seat.  He's a military cop, and so he enjoys all that survival stuff, and fighting zombies.. whatever. For me, it had superb plot and character development. I think you got the most realistic look at what it would really be like to live in a post apocalyptic world. That maybe you'd want to all gang together with people, but those people wouldn't necessarily be *nice*, that they'd all have their flaws, that they'd all be under stress and not as cooperative as you'd like. There's of course conflicts between characters, heart warming friendships, love-triangles, and every episode ends on a cliff hanger.<br /><br />This is a great DVD to add to your collection. You'll definitely want to lend it out to anyone who was unfortunate enough to have missed it when it aired on TV.  And of course, when Season 2 airs, you'll want to refresh your memory of Season 1!  This is my all time favorite of the zombie genre.
0553801473|3.0|Just like everyone else, I have waited a long time for this book. I didn't cry, hibernate, send hate mail or moan about the wait. I'm not a writer, have no aspirations to be one or know the difficulties involved.  That being said, I do read, a lot, a really huge amount of the printed word, on paper goes into my head on a daily basis. I feel that this book was more than half, nothing but filler, fluff, and crap. Just being paid by the page, were you George?  So much of this book was repetitious, inane, boring, hey didn't we just cover that?, nonsense.  Need I go on? No, I needn't.  I am not being paid by the word.  A book that I was anticipating eagerly, which should have been devoured in under two days, took me the better part of a week, it was so boring. Perhaps George or I will live long enough to see the end of the series, perhaps not.  I've found with this last installment, I really don't care about the series anymore.  If and when it comes out, I'll put it on hold at the library.
B004G600A4|3.0|I'm sad too give any disney movie a three star rating, espically a disney animated film, but this movie in the end is only worth that. Because the film did have tangled of problems, watching the film I can't but help \\"What if\\" over and over with each character, and story, point.      For one let's talk about the script, the first script was completly different in pre production stages, the disney company wanted to do a Shrek like movie (There words not mine) and had two girls fall into a fairy tale book. Think enchanted meets shrek, but the script was later on changed too what we have here today.    Watching the film I wish they took more \\"Beauty and beast,\\"  approach, tragic tale of girl being locked away. Disney had done that theme before, with \\"Beauty and beast\\" and \\"Hunch back of notre dame\\" making those films more memorable, as well as the characters. You feel there pain, and you know \\"They want more\\"     While tangled did in fact have that, just wasn't that strong and memorable for me as disney other films, I belive the major factor for that, or for me is in the characters themselfs. For me, they were too copy cat, I seen this, non stop these past two decade's.   Example the horse, that comedy gag was used in dream works El doradora, the horse acted the same way, and love interest Finn, just felt too much like Aladdin, meets prince from princess frog. Now I do admit he did redeem himself later on, but I just can't help but feel disapotioned still that his character was written different in the start. Just something new, but I can forgive that because movie's been doing that for decade, I just wish did something different wise.    Because of the many script revison, and fear of not making it's money back the story was alter from it's fairy tale orgin hoping to get the boy audience. And that's it problem, it should been more fairy tale like, follwed what beauty and beast did as I said up there.      and I blame that was fault of script revision, and when I say script revision I mean allot of script revision. After Princess and frog was relsea and did not perform as strong as disney company would like it too, Tangled was alter in plot wise, hoping to reach a broader range. More for the boys, hence the name change, and more of a road trip movie.
B00007EDY5|4.0|Good price and delvery from amazon.com.  I have not had an opportunity to used the terminal so I can't rate the device yet.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's far from good. Jane Eyre is a love story, a tortured and true enduring love story...this movie is not that. I've seen better versions, the 1943 Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine version has more feeling and depth then this. Shoot, just about every version I've ever seen tells more of the story and has more feeling then this. I've loved the dark and haunting story of Jane Eyre since I first read the book ten or so years ago, and I had such high hopes for this the latest screen adaptation of the novel, but I must say I am so greatly disappointed.
B000001EHS|5.0|Amazing band.  Remember when a song made you cruise down the road and lose track of time? This album has one after another to take you there.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I bought the E7 mainly to see if it would improve sound quality from my Sony Walkman x series. It does.    The Sony x series has a great amp anyway, including various sound enhancement options eg dynamics sound enhancement etc. I prefer the sound with EQ and all other enhancement options turned of though but...set up in this way I thought perhaps the device was lacking a bit of power so decided to try adding a Fii0 E7. At the moment I'm using Beats Pro headphones. Laugh if you will but I like them.    I have set it up using the FiiO L5 Line Out Dock Cable for Sony Walkman MP3 Player not the headphone out socket. This method utilizes the Sony DAC as normal but bypasses the inbuilt amp. It's worth mentioning that the EQ and sound enhancements can still be utilized when set up this way but I keep then all turned off.    So how does it sound?..... Well it's in a different league. It sounds smooth if that makes sense, sound stage is widened and depth and instrument separation are noticeably increased. Imagine you have just added a £50 sound enhancement to an already great sounding £200 player. The amp seems to do everything the Sony could do with just that little bit more, and with very little effort. To my ears it's a noticeable step up in quality. If anyone still believes compressed music does not sound good on a DAP, you aint heard nothin yet. Try these two babies together.    I don't like the bass EQ settings on the E7. To me they don't just enhance bass but change the EQ overall so I keep it off. If you prefer a bit more bass you can go into the Sony and use the clear bass function. It's a bit more subtle than the E7 and doesn't muddy the overall sound as much.    If you have a Sony Walkman and are prepared to compromise some size and portability for sound quality the E7 is a must have addition. The Fii0 E7 is the same size as the X series. Do use the L5 line out though. Using the E7 though the headphone out socket doesn't produce the same effect.    Ya gotta hearit to believe it.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|Let's start with personal history: I've been a YES fan since the early '70s, when \\"The YES Album\\" made its debut.  I've seen them in concert well over 20 times, and the band has, for better or worse, become my life's soundtrack.  I reveled in their '70s triumphs, stuck with them through the directionless '80s, was reinvigorated with them in the '90s, and felt reunited with them in the '00s.  Although I was never a big fan of Howe, the combination of Howe/Anderson/Squire/Wakeman was synergy defined.  Through it all I came to admire Jon Anderson the most, since he seemed to hold the vision -- the soul -- of YES most personally.    So it was with great trepidation that I decided to buy this CD.  In fact, I'd planned to boycott it, simply because I felt that what the band did to him was unfathomable, given nearly 40 years of history.    But I bought it because I'd enjoyed \\"Drama,\\" and because I felt a sense of loyalty.  Plus, I wanted to give Benoit David a fair shake.    I won't go through the songs individually since many others have already done that. But my impression of the CD is this:  it's very good music, played well, but it has all the soul of elevator music.  In all honesty, the first two times I listened to the CD I didn't listen all the way through because I had \\"something else to do.\\"  The music didn't rivet me to the speakers, didn't give me a reason to put off that \\"something else\\" until the CD finished.  It didn't hold my attention, wrap around me, draw me in, and expand my mind the way almost every other YES album has done.    Benoit David does a wonderful job, and as others have said, he finds his own voice on this CD.  He doesn't try to imitate Anderson, and that's good.  The problem is, he's just singing the notes and voicing the words.  His delivery comes across without any emotion.  Technically he hits all the notes, but he's not feeling the lyrics.  He's not telling a story he's lived, he's reading some words written by someone else.  He's alwaysan arm's length away from everything he's singing.  He's a narrator, not a storyteller.    And hearing his lyrical interpretation made me really realize what Anderson brought to the band.  He conveyed the joy, the wonder, the fear, the confusion that his always-obscure lyrics brought to the music.  When he sang \\"Aaaah!\\" you knew he felt it; when David sings \\"Aaaah!\\" you can tell someone told him to do it.    Trevor Horn is all over this CD.  The songs sound like his, the lyrics sound like his, the subject matter (e.g. \\"this abandoned airfield\\") sounds like his.  The arrangements sound like his, the instrumentation sounds like his.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's just that it feels like the CD should have been subtitled, \\"YES plays the music of Trevor Horn.\\"  I get the impression that the band members were too burned out to contribute and just played along... literally.    In regards to playing, Chris Squire puts in an extremely solid performance on bass, but it somehow lacks the fire of his earlier years.  When you listen to the last handful of YES CDs, you can hear him slowly cooling and losing that fire; he knows he's good so he's just not trying to raise the bar any more.  Alan White, whom I've always liked as a drummer, honestly sounds like he phoned-in his performance here.  He's been put so low in the mix, and his playing lacks so much style, that I forgot he was playing midway through the first song.  Geoff Downes, never one of my favorites, is also there somewhere.  And Howe adds his signature soloing through most of the electric songs (although his runs seem to be a lot less clean this time around).  Howe's acoustic pieces are clean, yet somehow very predictable.    In all, though, it's a solid CD.  It's just that, when it ends, it doesn't make me want to play it again and again. Instead, my reaction is always, \\"That's nice.\\" In fact, the only reason I DO return to it again and again is because I keep thinking I missed something on the previous plays.  I always find out I didn't.    I guess it turns out I keep looking for the soul of YES, the fire of YES, the energy, the drive, the power.  And I never seem to find it on this CD.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|The truth is: people only like Adele because she is overweight. That is the gosh-darn truth! Teens think they are listening to high-brow, mature music just because Adele doesn't look like a stereotypical female pop singer. I have heard fans boasting \\"Oh, I listen to Adele\\"...like it some academic achievement that should be admired. There is a touch of snobbery about Adele fans.  It is now not \\"cool\\" to be a thin, blonde female singer! Society has gone topsy-turvy! Thin, female popstars are considered trashy...yet overweight, female popstars are considered \\"Real Women\\" who sing deep/meaningful songs! Bizarre...  EDIT: People saying \\"You haven't listened to the album\\" are wrong! I have!   I appreciate melancholic ballads (I am a massive Karen Carpenter fan) but Adele is too depressing for my tastes. I just want to shake her and say: \\"Cheer up, honey! It's not that bad! People are dying in Africa, yet you were a millionaire by the time you were 20!\\".  Sure, Adele can belt out a song...but can she sing? Shouting does NOT equal singing! There is a difference! PLEASE LISTEN TO THE BRITISH SINGER \\"RUMER\\" TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINGING AND SHOUTING! She can really sing!

B004EC937G|2.0|Rockferry was a great Soul/Pop record. Duffy's good girl image combined with the albums heartfelt tracks made for the perfect companion piece to the darkness of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Unfortunately second effort Endlessly is a bit of a misfire. There are no standout tracks like 'Warwick Avenue' or 'Mercy' and the lyrics are one dimensional & overly syrupy throughout. Listening to the album it feels like the producers didn't really know what sound they were going for. On 'Well, Well, Well' (the first and only single) the music has more of a dance feel but it doesn't quite work.<br /><br />Overall perhaps the biggest disappointment is that Duffy never sings at full power as she did on Rockferry tracks such as 'Serious'. Her unique voice was the core of what made that album so appealing but on Endlessly she does not display the same range. A few of the songs have their own subtle charm such as the Kylie Minogue esque 'Lovestruck' and string accompanied 'Breath Away' (which is quite good) but overall the album is forgettable and unlikely to have you hitting the repeat button. One for completists only.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is an epic dystopian tale that is set in the future aftermath of the destruction of North America and the emergence of the nation of Panem. This current nation is made up of the Capitol and is surrounded by twelve (once thirteen) Districts that are entirely subservient to produce goods to sustain the Capitol. Seventy five years ago, the districts tied to rebel and once defeated, the thirteenth district was annihilated.    Following the put down of the rebellion and in order to subjugate any rebel embers, the Reaping was established as a part of the Treaty of Treason, wherein a lottery is drawn once a year in the remaining Districts, where all children between the ages of 12 and 18 are required to enter their names for the Hunger Games.    One girl and one boy are from each district are chosen as participants Hunger Games, a gladiator-like blood sport where the rules state only one can be the victor. The twenty-four competitors must eliminate the competition by killing them and the contest is televised and is requisite viewing for the nation.    Katniss Everdeen lives in District Twelve, an area devoted to coal mining. After her father died working in the mines and her mother suffered a severe debilitating depression after his death leaving, twelve year old Katniss was forced to provide for her mother and her young sister, Prim.    With her friend and hunting partner Gale, Katniss sneaks out of the confines of District Twelve, underneath an electrified fence, learns to hunt and gather food in the nearby woods in order to keep both their families from starving.    During the current Reaping ceremony, against the odds Katniss twelve year old sister, Prim, name is drawn as the female tribute. Katniss immediately volunteers to take her younger sister's place. Peeta, the baker's son, is the male name selected.    Katniss captures the viewing public's imagination with her hunting and tracking skills and fiery temperament but now she is faced with whether she can kill her competitors and her partner from her own district in order to win.    Suzanne Collins has brilliantly created a quintessential futuristic dystopian series for young adults that also sink its teeth into readers of all ages.    I'm not a person who is easily moved by emotion when reading a fictional story, yet I found myself tearing up over several significant parts of this book. I was so moved that immediately bought the next two books of the trilogy because I was eager to continue reading Katniss and Peeta's journey.
B004NROYUI|3.0|Okay, so I sprung for the camera and when the case came out I just HAD to have it. Some people have more money than brains.<br /><br />As a case it's okay. Not great, just okay. Worth the price? Uh uh.<br /><br />Aside from price, my main gripe is the strap. It's way too bulky and gets in the way when trying to shoot. I left the nylon strap on the camera. So what I was left with was an expensive leather case and a crappy looking nylon strap.<br /><br />But the whole point of owning this camera is that it is very definitely cool, so why hide it in a blah case?<br /><br />Bottom line is I use the case for storage at home.

I have had my copy replaced twice and all copies freeze at the same point in the film.  I have 2 top of the line Pioneer Elite Blu-ray players used on Pioneer Kuro Plasma sets and a top of the line Denon Universal player and the top Oppo player all with the most recent firmware; none have frozen on any other Blu-ray discs before or since playing Rango and all copies of the Rango Blu-ray freeze on all of the players at the same place.  It is during the second chase scene of the big bird after Rango as they go through the streets destroying everything in their path.  The players at the point of the freeze read: 1 - 7 - 03229.  The film is worth keeping for the DVD copy.  Here's to hoping for a reissue or recall or firmware design upgrade that takes care of the abrupt halt to the film.  Fast forwarding past the point works for the rest of the film!  Enjoy.<br /><br />UPDATE TO THE ABOVE COMMENTS: As of 4/10/13 FIRMWARE UPDATES to all players HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM formerly with the playback of the Blu-ray copy of this magnificent film!!!

I don't believe what happened on the wall will stick if you know what I mean. As for Mrs. Dragon queen rocked. I will say that it didn't have any holy crap moments for her but it really made her character deeper. Reek was the best addition. His story was hard to take but beautiful. I liked what he said to his sister in the end.<br /><br />I hear the Winds of Winter calling my name. Hopefully it doesn't take to long.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was my first Suzanne Collins book, and I am hooked.  I am just finishing this trilogy.    Hunger Games hooked me from the very beginning.  Collins' writing is clear, concise, description to the point that I visualized the people, places and circumstances as if they were happening before me.  I felt that I had to keep reading this book to get Katniss out of trouble.      Amazing writing.  Keeps you clued to the book from the beginning and leaving you wanting more.  That's where book 2 and 3 come in.
B000001GQU|5.0|When I recently purchased this CD from amazon, I was expecting a very striking performance of a piece I adore in frankly dated sound, a \\"historical\\" issue that I would enjoy while making allowances for the hiss and distortion present in even the good recordings from this era.  With that in mind, I popped it into my pretty good family room stereo system - and was surprised.  There was very little distortion, the sound color was varied and vivid, the soundstage (the 3-D simulation created by stereo equipment) was big.  Could this recording really be from 1954?  So I took it upstairs to my main system, which is highly resolving and comes close to costing as much as a used car.  Well, the CD sounded great on this system as well: full-bodied, almost imperceptible hiss, three-dimensional (check out the beginning of the \\"Lux aeterna\\" (track 14)!), very dynamic.  Heck, I wish many of my 1980s and 1990s digital efforts sounded as good as this CD.  This is one the very best pre-1960 recordings I have ever heard judged on an engineering level.<br /><br />What's important about the cutting-edge engineering is that it brings to life a performance of the Requiem led by Fricsay that is amazing.  It sweeps you away with its power and technical accomplishment.  Just listen to the staggered entrance of the four soloists in the opening movement and I think you will instinctively know what I am talking about.  Each of the four soloists - Maria Stader (soprano - a long-time collaborator with Fricsay), Marianna Radev (a mezzo with an old-fashioned sound, but great musicality), Kim Borg (tenor) and Helmut Krebs (bass) - are at times brilliant.  Fricsay leads a passionate performance by the chorus and orchestra.  I also want to point to just crack brass playing by the Berlin RIAS section.  Fricsay sometimes does things differently: his Offertorium (track 11) is much quicker than I am used to, for example.  But there's conviction and musicality in every corner of this great rendition.<br /><br />This is a recording that is a credit to everyone involved in - from Giuseppe (who means every note he writes) to the musicians to the remastering engineers.  5 stars with an exclamation point.<br />This is a recording that is a credit to everyone involved in - from Giuseppe (who means every note he writes) to the musicians to the remastering engineers.  5 stars with an exclamation point.
0316069353|3.0|I was really looking forward to Michael Connelly's new book Fifth Witness.  Sorry to report it did not measure up to his previous books.  The story itself was fine but the legal detail was incredibly boring.  I felt like it I was just reading transcripts from a court case at times.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Not terrible but not that great either.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|My husband is the big PS3 nut in the house, though both I and our 7 1/2yr old daughter also play a few games on it. I have no issues with the oem controller, but then again I have smaller hands and never play for more then about a 1/2 hour at a time. My husband's hands are larger and he can play some of his games for HOURS... he kept complaining that his hands were cramping up (no really?) and the oem PS3 controller wasn't as comfortable as others he's used in the past or with other systems. When we started having issues with the OEM controller not holding a charge anymore this seemed like a great replacement option.     For me it's stil useable, and honestly given the dead zones other has mentioned it's a better controller for me then my husband in that respect (the games I play aren't precise) though the oem is more comfortable to me to hold... however for him he's torn with the new controller. Fit wise and comfort wise he's super happy with it, reports that hand fatigue is way down and that it feels more natural to him, however he plays the 1st person role playing games and said the dead zones are killing him with this controller.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I am a person who can't get enough of Legend. Anyone who has watched Legend should know there are two versions of Legend. It is packed into a two DVD set. One is the director's cut and the other is the U.S. Theatrical Version. The only difference that I know of is the Music. The U.S. version has music from Tangerine Dream, the Directors Cut has Jerry Goldsmith's music. Jerry Goldsmith's music is fine but not quit lively enough as Tangerine Dream's music. Now, The Directors Cut I do believe has more film footage in the film. I do like the extra footage and the differences in the Director's cut but in the U.S. version I love the music. I have seen comments on both sides for this movie. If you are a person who likes the movie either one is fine. Pick the one you like best and go with it. I like both for different reasons.
1933952806|5.0|I have the Kindle version of this book, and although I think it's a great version for quick reference, I plan on buying the hard copy version.  I have read other \\"Mastering\\" books by this author, and he is one of the best and most knowledgable authors about Nikon cameras.  The Nikon D7000 DSLR is a very complex camera and Darrell Young writes in \\"plain English\\" and explains all the tools available for this camera very well.  If you don't have this book, and you want to know how to use the many functions of your D7000 camera, you should get this book.
B000084T18|4.0|I wanted to dislike this album when it dropped but I didn't I actually liked it a lot. I still do, I think it is a really strong debut record and the production is super tight.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Bought these ear phones for my son's 12th birthday.  He loves them.  He uses them every time he plays now.  I like them because I don't have to hear the game the whole time he is playing, because he system is in the family room.  Very happy with the product.
B000001FI7|5.0|This record is a classic. It was a classic the second it dropped and all this time later it still rules. Even if you don't like Portishead, there is a good chance you will like this record.
B000002I8D|5.0|Phil Collins \\"Face Value\\" was his first solo record released in 1981 and it definitely set the pattern for what we would come to expect from him in the next decade. Up to this point he was the drummer and then lead singer of Genesis and after this record he was a star. I happen to be a fan of the Peter Gabriel era Genesis more than the Phil version but I'm the first to admit that Collins has his appeal. He certainly found a musical niche for himself with a combination of horn driven pop coupled with ballads. Throughout the remainder of the 80's Collins was one of the top selling artists but when combined with his Genesis output; he was everywhere.  \\"Face Value\\" was the blueprint and still most consistent album Collins recorded. \\"In the Air Tonight\\" with its famous drum intro half-way through the song remains one of his finest while \\"I Missed Again\\" set the standard for the horn-section upbeat pop he became famous for many times later. Its easy to forget as well that Collins was a very talented drummer and contributes many of the instruments to this record. The instrumental \\"Droned\\" provides a great change of pace and his ballad \\"If Leaving Me is Easy\\" is as good as any Collins recorded. While Collins went on to have many hit singles and multi-million selling albums; this one is really the foundation for his solo career and the most consistently satisfying of the bunch.
B000059QYB|5.0|This is a great collection of all Billy's greatest hits. I like the selection and it reminds me of growing up in the 80's. Its amazing to hear how good music used to be when people actually sang and played instruments. Imagine that? Lol.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush has been around for four decades; creating their music and then touring around the world to support it. While Rush might never make the Hall of Fame (many argue they should) they have to go down as one of the premier rock acts of all time. Perhaps being Canadian has limited their exposure a bit but they have legions of fans and remain a huge live act in many parts of the world (check out the DVD \\"Rush in Rio\\" if you want proof). One of Rush's greatest attributes is the incredible musical talents of the individual members and how they coalesce that into a powerful and distinctive sound that defies the fact they are merely a trio.     After pursuing a late-70's progressive rock vibe Rush began to veer into more radio friendly, shorter compositions like their main-stay hit \\"Spirit of Radio\\". This continued in 1981 with the release of \\"Moving Pictures\\" which produced their two most popular songs \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\". The guitar, percussion and increasing use of keyboard interplay are outstanding and even Geddy Lee's banshee wail has been toned down a notch of two from the earlier albums. While they went on to record many albums after this one; none had the combination of commercial appeal along with stellar musicianship that has cemented this record as their greatest. It includes \\"Witch Hunt\\" and the concert favorite \\"YYZ\\" (the international airport code for their hometown Toronto). Definitely the high water mark for this great and (I believe) underappreciated rock trio.
1594202710|5.0|If you want to understand the complexity of China's ancient and modern history, read this book.  If you want to grasp the subtle ways of diplomacy, read this book.  If you want to find hopeful signs of progress towards world civilization, read this book.  If you are interested in all of these things, read this book twice.  It is an easy read, however, read with care so as not to miss what is not said.     The first chapter concludes with a brilliant analogy to demonstrate the difference between the Western and Chinese approach to politics, diplomacy, and international relations.  A favorite Chinese board game is Wei Qi in which the players seek to achieve dominance and win by slow accumulation of advantage over the opponent.  This patient process is compared to the Western game of Chess, where direct confrontation and battle to the death is the name of the game.  It is Machiavelli versus the near mythical Sun Tzu's teachings in Art of War advocating strategic persistence.    The first half of the book deals with Mao Zedong as he led the Chinese people on a highly destructive goose chase, and there was no golden egg laid.  Communism did not work - it did not produce an egalitarian society or a prosperous economy.  Human nature inevitably overrode and corrupted the power of the state.  As Maslow pointed out in his Hierarchy of Need, people who are motivated by their needs for safety and security, readily succumb to corruption.     In the second half, Deng Xiaoping refutes Maoism, restores Confucianism,  ends central planning and begins the long march to the phenomenal resurgence of China still carried on by his successors as they strive to create a \\"harmonious\\" state.     The book ends with a significant correlation.  Western Europe, once a polyglot of 34 nations maintained a shifting balance of powers to prevent any one from becoming a threat.  When Bismarck unified the Germanic nations, this changed and, with the advent of Hitler, Germany threatened the continent and the world.  Only the intervention of America ended that eternal conflict and resulted in a new goal, union.        Union is not an easy step for Europe, nor was it for the American Colonies, nor will it be for China.  Nevertheless, it will be China and America, neither having hegemonic aspirations, that will unite the world in peace - or divide it in war.    The take-away message is this: as we struggle with our two party system, we must be patient as China struggles with her one party system.  Beyond politics, beyond diplomacy, we must cooperate economically to attain universal prosperity.  Our mutual goal must be a world prosperous enough to aspire to and ultimately attain the highest level in Maslow's Hierarchy of Need, universal altruism.
B003L77GRO|2.0|Why on earth the producers would have ruined the entire season with the lack-of performance by Julie Stiles is beyond me when they showed such wisdon in their casting the first 5 seasons. She just phones in her \\"acting\\" and her attitude is also SO poor. I really hope they get a dynamic girl for the upcoming season to replace her! The replacement doesn't have to be likable, doesn't have to be gorgeous, just NOT Stiles.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|I think that Sucker Punch is a much better and more interesting film than many critics give it credit for. I don't, however, think that the subtle machinations of the plot layers are the point of the film, or should be used to intellectually justify it by saying &quot;complex=good&quot;. For me, this film is less an intellectual exercise than a stream-of-consciousness expression of emotion; it's about feeling powerless, and escaping that feeling through fantasy. The mechanics of the plot are just there to support the emotional content.<br /><br />After the plot's complexity, the most controversial part of the film is the &quot;video game&quot; action sequences. Honestly, I am a bit iffy about them conceptually, as their relationship to the main plot is extremely tenuous, but to my surprise I found these sequences mostly very engaging and even moving. The exception to this was the sequence that most needed to be emotionally engaging - the train heist. It might have been because it was poorly directed, or because I was worn out by the preceding action scenes. Whatever the reason, I found this part just didn't work. It's the one big flaw of the piece.<br /><br />Another controversial element often mentioned is the skimpy outfits the heroines wear. I don't think the allegations of sexism are valid as generally stated. If women are working at an exotic dance club, it is natural that they would &quot;hang out&quot; in their costumes or in their underwear - this is pretty much standard for back-stage behaviour. I didn't find the photography at all leering. What might be questionable is the fetish outfits* the heroines wear during the &quot;video game&quot; sequences. This is part of a wider argument about the double-image of feisty female protagonists, going back at least to the Alien movies, and I don't think Sucker Punch will solve the argument conclusively for either side.<br /><br />Maybe these diverse criticisms are inevitable if you try to combine accessible contemporary action with arthouse explorations of plot and emotion. But Snyder deserves points for trying, and succeeding as much as he has.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br /><br />(*And of course by &quot;fetish outfits&quot; I don't mean kinky leather, but outfits containing certain elements which have become iconic to the video game-playing, anime-watching generation (i.e. sailor suits, samurai swords, aeronautical goggles, etc.). Failure to comprehend the iconic nature of these and other elements is the main reason older critics disliked this film. The question of what meaning these symbols possess when stripped of their original context is an issue so big I won't even attempt to deal with it here.)t Snyder deserves points for trying, and succeeding as much as he has.    3.5 stars        (*And of course by \\"fetish outfits\\" I don't mean kinky leather, but outfits containing certain elements which have become iconic to the video game-playing, anime-watching generation (i.e. sailor suits, samurai swords, aeronautical goggles, etc.).

0393338827|4.0|Michael Lewis returns to financial topics in this book, detailing the credit default issue that toppled markets in 2009. I enjoyed the book and learned a lot, but I have to admit I was often lost in the arcane detail of high finance.  That's more the fault of Wall Street than Lewis, but still, it is worth noting that this is not a book for readers with a casual interest in the bond market. It's pretty complicated stuff.
B001CDZ40K|5.0|For those of us who love French cooking this is a very important book to have.  So much information clearly and precisely presented.  You're given not just recipes but also techniques that you will use all during your cooking life.  I find it absolutely indispensable.  I've given several books as gifts to other friends who appreciate fine food beautifully made and lovingly presented.
030788743X|5.0|I had a blast reading this book.  In a day and age when every facet of your childhood is referenced in countless VH-1 shows, blog posts, and comedy routines, this book managed to dredge up memories that brought countless smiles to my face.    Oh yeah, and it's a ripping good yarn, too.    Other reviewers have posted detailed plot synopses, so I won't waste the energy, but if you like adventure stories and grew up on D&D, Atari, and lived at the arcade, you will have a blast with this book.  I tore through it in two days and I'm thinking about plowing through it again.    Highly recommended.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a great family movie!  Although there is a small amount of language that would make it inapropriate for toddlers, the story and compassion in this film makes it exciting for adults as well as young people. Great acting cast all around.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|A good military movie but instead of an enemy from another country, they battle aliens. Good effects. We liked it and have watched it several times already.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|For those wondering why this set is being re-released for $20 cheaper then the one currently available from Amazon, it's because this set is smaller and the discs are all on one giant spindle, like other complete sets like Sanford & Son. As long as that doesn't bother you, by all means save the $20 and wait for this set to be released.    $40 for 200+ episodes of Married...With Children? That's a deal even Al Bundy can afford.
B005DI94FQ|3.0|Maybe I'm peculiar, but I typically buy a shooting script in order to get a sense of how the film itself came to be, which always means that more was shot than ends up on screen. For instance in many of the Newmarket series of shooting scripts, the shooting script gives us what does not end up on screen, or in some cases may end up as deleted-scenes or alternate takes as special features. This is true for instance of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Slumdog Millionaire. But this is plainly a transcription of the finished Dark Knight. As someone else said, who needs this, when all you have to do is see the movie? It's a real shame, because I think this is one heckuva of fine movie, and I'd love to know more about what they were planning vs what they put on screen.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Why does this get released on November 29th? They usually release Smallville in September, if someone can tell me why I would greatly appreciate it. However Samllville was one of the best shows on television along with Supernatural, Psych, and Mad Men in my opinion. As a Superman collector for years and years I was very happy that this show was able to wrap things up without being cut short. Smallville quite frankly means a lot to me and I refuse to believe that one season was better than another, it's a very large character arc and some lulls are to be expected when a character is developed from beginning to end (or at least the end of that particular chapter of development). Even after Michael Rosenbaum left the show after season seven they didn't panic, they still worked hard and gave it's audience something worth their time.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they had done and I know that it was impossible but I would have loved to have seen it at least once would have been Clark meeting a young Bruce Wayne. I just think that would have been really really awesome, but it wasn't possible and I'm not sure it would have worked in the plot line. Tom Welling will forever be my envisionment of Superman/Clark Kent and he even without being a hardcore fan of the Superman mythos just continually knocked it out of the park episode after episode. I would just like to say thanks to him for being awesome.<br /><br />The real reason you would want to buy this is simply to finish your consumption of an epic story, a transformation from man to legend, from hero to superhero. I wasn't sure how they were going to tie up everything after ten years worth of plot to integrate into two hours but they succeeded in grandiose fashion and I wasn't even slightly disappointed. A very heartfelt thank you to everyone associated with the show, on my end it has been a very fun ride and this show will be sorely missed.
0375703764|5.0|I have had this book sitting on my bookshelf for a few years now with the idea that I would eventually get around to reading it. I knew that it would be a big undertaking as it is over 700 pages and when you open it seems like a daunting task.    Now that I have finished it (in 3 days because I couldn't put it down) I had to write a review to encourage people to read this book. It is an amazing piece of literature and art. The stories will capture you as will the style that the book is written in.    I had multiple dreams/ nightmares involving the main story line in this book, which has never happened to me before. This book is scary but at the end of the book it is hard to identify what you were really afraid of and for me that seemed to be one of the main points of the story.    I really hope that even though this book is a few years old, more and more people discover it and are amazed by it.    I would also recommend that you download the companion CD \\"Haunted\\" by Poe. It adds so much more to the whole experience.
B004E5D2M0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this show and this collection does not disappoint!  From the content to the packaging, everything is terrific.  It contains every episode PLUS a number of DVD extras not available on the individual seasons.  It's a great addition to our Royal DVD collection.  I was concerned with how long it took to be delivered, but then read about the postal strike in Canada.  That said, it did still arrive within the estimated timeframe.  Very happy with this purchase!
B005HEEIBQ|5.0|Music, over the top? Check. Acting, for the last row? Check. Writing, dramatic? Check. One destroyed starship? Check. The plot is thin, the original special effects are cheesy(plastic model for the Constellation and a paper mache planet killer). But this ranks as one of the best Star Trek TOS. It all holds together and showcases classic Shatner as Kirk. Lines \\"Not with my ship!\\" and \\"I'm going to ram her right down her throat!\\" are just too good to miss. The new releases vastly improve the special effects and I like them. Great Trek!
0553801473|1.0|At the end of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (AFFC) we could read :<br />\\"Tyrion , Jon , Danny ..... will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons (ADWD), which will focus on the events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present  book focused on King's Landing.<br />G.Martin June 2005\\"<br /><br />Further, to justify that just 680 pages of AFFC took 5 years to be written, G.Martin tells us that ADWD was ALREADY finished. He merely had to publish the available material in two books instead of one.<br /><br />Well as we all know, ADWD didn't come the next year nor the year after. The book \\"already written\\" in 2005 took full 6 years to be published. It was necessary to remind these facts because, obviously this incredibly long time span raised significantly our expectations.<br />If we had already to wait so long, it better be a masterpiece of A Storm of Swords caliber.<br /><br />Let us be honest, ADWD is to the Song of Ice and Fire what the Crossroads of Twilight were to the Wheel of Time. In other words a subpar lazy piece of writing which deserves 1 star because it is not possible to give less.<br />As an aggravating circumstance comes that this piece of .... work was laboriously extruded during a full decade (AFFC+ADWD = 11 years).<br />The Crossroads of Twilight has been very weak but at least R.Jordan didn't need 11 years to throw it at us.<br /><br />Readers and the series fans have speculated that George Martin has lost inspiration or interest.<br />I submit that he lost both.<br /><br />First he obviously lost interest.<br />ADWD has 959 pages prologue and epilogue included and contains 73 chapters.<br />Let us be generous and consider that Martin mislead us and that actually only the half of this has been written in june 2005, so 480 pages and 37 chapters.<br />That leaves us with 36 chapters and 480 pages to write.<br />Obviously a writer committed  to his work and as devoted as G.Martin says he is, will put some hard work in the writing.<br />Nobody expects 8 hours a day but ... what do you think about his interest when the result is 480 pages in 6 years, 312 weeks?<br />If one considers that Martin wrote more than 1 chapter a week for the first 3 volumes (and how GOOD those volumes were !), he'd have indeed needed about 1 year to finish ADWD as he said.<br />The unavoidable conclusion by comparing the 37 weeks of work with the 312 weeks delay is that Martin spent about 10% of his available productive time on writing ADWD.<br />Those glaring disparities tell a clear story : while Martin had been both inspired and interested during the first 3 volumes, he bungled AFFC and completely lost interest in ADWD.<br />As this would be irrelevant we'll not speculate about the reasons but everybody who occasionaly read Martin's blog knows why he lost interest.<br />A severe case of hypercephalitis (new Tolkien indeed !) has certainly played a role .<br /><br />Second he lost inspiration.<br />Here we will go in some length and spoilers are unavoidable. Actually there is nothing surprising or unexpected that happens in ADWD to warrant a spoiler alert but it is a tradition that I respect.<br />As I said, ADWD is composed of 73 chapters. They are structured as folllows:<br /><br />The Wall+ Stannis: 22 chapters and 30 % of ADWD<br />===============================================<br />Jon : 14<br />Davos : 4<br />Asha : 3<br />Melissandre : 1<br /><br />As you see this part which makes a whopping third of ADWD is all about Jon. What is so thrilling about him that Martin needs 14 chapters?<br />Well Jon counts sausages. Cheese too. When he doesn't count sausages he receives wildlings south of the Wall. As they are many and more (mostly weak, wounded, crippled and otherwise impaired), he wonders what they will eat. And goes to count sausages. All this interspersed with<br />\\"You know nothing\\" , \\"Corn,corn,corn\\"and \\"The night is dark and full of terror\\". It finishes with a REALLY ridiculous wannabe cliffhanger which will make you burst out laughing.<br /><br />The 4 Davos chapters are among the best and especially Lord Wyman Manderly, one of the few survivors of the excellent beginnings, is truly a character that still has 3 dimensions.<br /><br />Asha is useless drivel and Melissandre without interest.<br />For those interested about Stannis like I am, his arc doesn't advance a single inch but you will be fed (another) ridiculous cliffhanger so that you may wait the next 5 or 10 years.<br /><br />Meeren + Daenerys : 33 chapters and 45% of ADWD<br />===============================================<br />Tyrion : 13<br />Daenerys : 10<br />Barristan : 4<br />Quentyn : 4<br />Victarion : 2<br /><br />I admit that I waited for this part with much interest. Most of us remember Martin's whining how he was struggling year after year with the \\"Meerenese knot\\". For the struggling part as I showed above he didn't struggle much. So what about the knot part?<br /><br />Tyrion \\"Wherever whores go\\" Lannister is actually on travels. You may leave him a message, he will call back in 5 years. Or 10. Is that all? Yes it is. Nothing knotted there.<br /><br />Daenerys transformed in a whining sex obsessed teenager with about as much intelligence as an oyster. We all know that her only purpose in the book is to tame her dragons, get to Westeros and kick Lanisters' a...s. Not that there are many Lannisters left because Martin has already exterminated everything that counted in the family anyway.<br />Well in those 10 chapters Daenerys didn't make any progress towards this goal.<br />She's stranded in Meeren surrounded by all kinds of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks who do not like her and want the fighter pits opened. She doesn't. Then she opens them anyway. Everything is linear, boring and predictable. The slave and slavers can exterminate each other for all we care but they don't even do that. Not a trace of a knot here either.<br /><br />As Daenerys is temporarily absent, to get our dose  of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks we need Ser Barristan to give it. He kills some guy in a definitely non knotted way.<br /><br />Quentyn. This is a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody remembers this guy  and nobody cares. But that's all right because Martin kills him after the 4 chapters anyway. Pure waste of time and space. Useless to add that there is no knot even with the wildest imagination.<br /><br />Victarion is a real badass, one of the few that are left. I admit that I enjoyed his 2 chapters even if Martin succeeded in the very hard task consisting in avoiding any action or character development at any price . In any case Victarion is a very straightforward guy with nothing knotted about him.<br /><br />So definitely this part which makes about half of the book is happening in places we don't care about, indulges in endless travelling (Tyrion) and descriptions, contains no plot at all and is generally irrelevant to anything that was important for the series. It is especially this part which demonstrates how uninspired and boring Martin became - the Quentyn chapters are an embarrassment and an insult to the intelligence of all readers.<br />If there was any \\"knot\\" than it was only in Martin's imagination because with the best will you won't find anything that would be more complex or more knotted than a highway through Nevada .<br /><br />Westeros : 10 Chapters and 15 % of ADWD<br />========================================<br />Theon : 7<br />Cersei : 2<br />Jaime : 1<br /><br />Theon belongs with Davos to the best. We are in the thick of the contest for the North. The Boltons and the Freys are still their old selfs. We get a glimpse on what's seething in this cauldron and there are even moments which show that Westeros could still be interesting if Martin was not lazy and uncaring.<br /><br />Cersei was downgraded from a strong, beautiful  and vicious woman in Storm to a wilful totally paranoid bundle of nerves in AFFC. Martin finishes her off in ADWD. She is broken and exits the scene. Oh, I almost forgot, the last Lannister who still had some strength and personality gets killed too.<br /><br />Jaime's chapter is just a manner of Martin to taunt us \\"I served you a cliffhanger in AFFC and you thought to get the result in ADWD? Well I won't give it just to show you how little I care.  Perhaps in 6 years. RAFO ! Hehehe ! \\"<br /><br />Trash (for lack of better word) : 8 chapters and 10% of ADWD<br />=============================================================<br />Bran : 3<br />Arya : 2<br />Griff : 2<br />Areo : 1<br /><br />Bran's chapters consist of Bran watching roots grow. Literally. Unfortunately he's necessary to the plot because he will deal with The Others when the time comes. Probably in many and more years if Martin and we live so long. So we had to suffer through those bleak chapters just to avoid forgetting who he was.<br />I can understand that some readers were so desperate that even watching roots grow was an improvement to many other chapters so that they semi-liked the Bran's part.<br /><br />Arya's chapters are totally and utterly irrelevant to everything and anything. She has been training for assassin for the last 11 years and still does so.<br /><br />Griff introduces us to another resurrection. Not that we didn't expect this one.<br /><br />Areo. Who ?<br /><br />So what can be salvaged from this literary train wreck called ADWD preceded by another train wreck in the making, AFFC ?<br />Theon (7 chapters) , Davos (4 chapters) , Victarion (2 chapters) , Griff (1 chapter) , Daenerys (1 or 2 chapters) and Jon (1 or 2 chapters) . Maximum 17 chapters out of 73.<br />1 star .<br />I am very pessimistic for the continuation . Martin has clearly lost it and the story will now just follow the gravity forces with much and more copy and paste. The strong and powerful characters,  we cared for are dead and those who stay are either broken (Cersei,Daenerys,Jon) or irrelevant (Bran, Arya, Stannis). Oh perhaps Wyman Manderly will be the only shining moment left.<br />The plot grew stale , drawn out and predictable .<br />We'll see in 10 years if Martin can recover but I won't hold my breath and do not recommend you to do so either.

The plot of \\"Source Code\\" is very similar to that of the \\"X-Files\\" episode \\"Monday\\". The story centers on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal). The film begins with Stevens waking up on a train. He realizes, that he is in someone else's body. Within a few minutes, the train wakes up, where he regains conciseness in what is called a \\"Source Code\\". It is explained to him that the \\"Source Code\\" is a modern invention that allows one to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. Stevens's objective is to find the bomb on the train.    Overall, \\"Source Code\\" hooks you from the beginning and keeps your interest until the very end.
0316010669|4.0|One of the primary criticisms of Gladwell's book, a criticism common to popular social science books, is that it covers the underlying research on an overly superficial level.  I am not familiar with the scholarly work Gladwell relies upon, but if my experience in fields I am more familiar with holds, Blink certainly covers this corner of psychology on a superficial level.  But that is ok.  It would not be possible to write such a book otherwise.  More important, in my mind, to this kind of book is that it clearly explain the consequences of the research to and spark some excitement for the subject in the lay reader.  Blink achieves in spades on both counts.<br /><br />Blink is about snap judgments.  Or, to put it another way, decisions made subconsciously, not consciously.  Sometimes this is good (if you are an expert on the subject, for particularly complex decisions); sometimes this is bad (if the decision may be colored by subconscious, irrelevant biases).  When Gladwell  sticks to snap judgments (which he labels as \\"thin slicing\\"), Blink works.  The stories are funny, relevant, and interesting.<br /><br />We discover that it is very difficult to really understand many, many things without years and years of experience and training, but we can still tell what is good and what we like.  Gladwell uses jelly as an example, but take wine.  I can tell you which wines I like and even tell you which wine I like better.  But I cannot talk like a sommelier.  And, as much of the research Gladwell discusses suggests, attempting to do so would interfere with my unconscious ability to differentiate good wine from bad.<br /><br />Gladwell also tries to show how we can use an understanding of thin slicing to make better decisions, but he tends to give answers that are less than fully satisfying.  Gladwell relates how administrators at Cook County Hospital saved money and increased the accuracy of diagnoses by implementing a decision tree.  It is an odd case study.  Neither thin slicing nor conscious decision-making worked for the doctors; it was not an example of shifting from one to the other.  It was an example of the power of narrowing focus to a few truly relevant metrics (a powerful and highly useful subject, but it is not the subject of Blink).  In another case study, Gladwell never quite explains his point regarding the Kenna story, about a musician loved by record execs and ignored by the radio.  Presumably he meant to imply that the thin slicing by the record execs was right (because they are experts), but the thin slicing by the radio focus groups was wrong (because they were not experts and could not identify music they would enjoy as quickly).  Gladwell may be right, but that conclusion does not flow necessarily.<br /><br />Gladwell never really gives a solid basis for discerning when experts can be trusted.  From Blink, it would be easy to over rely on experts.  But a \\"sort of\\" expert can be worse than a layman.  In the counterfeit statute case study Gladwell starts with, both those who got it right and those who got it wrong were experts.  To give an example not in the books, literary \\"experts\\" have long denigrated the Lord of the Rings, while readers have had no trouble recognizing its brilliance (even if unable to explain why).  The literary experts did not have the expertise to properly evaluate the expertise in philology and mythology that Tolkien used.<br /><br />Gladwell's final application of thin slicing shows a poor understanding of his own material.  Gladwell observed that the percentage of female orchestra members shot up dramatically after a switch to screened auditions.  Irrelevant visual signals were crowding out the relevant audio signals.  Gladwell then extrapolates this to argue criminal defendants should be screened to mitigate subconscious racial bias.  But a jury trial is not an orchestra audition.  If a criminal defendant is on the stand in a jury trial, he visual cues are more important than the audioclues.  As Gladwell discussed earlier in the book, facial expressions tell an indelible story about what a person is really thinking (he even uses an example from the OJ Simpson trial!).  One of the primary duties of the jury is to assess the credibility of witnesses; how can they do this if they cannot see the person's face?  That this recommendation achieved such quick support from an audience at Harvard Law School says more about the state of legal education than its merit.the book, facial expressions tell an indelible story about what a person is really thinking (he even uses an example from the OJ Simpson trial!).

1451629184|4.0|This book shows what a strong little girl this young woman was when taken. I admire her efforts to keep her daughters out of the spotlight,and allow them to grow up in the world without people chasing them for pictures, and stories. I was so glad to see that she has such good counselors helping her to take her life back, and to help her figure out how to put her life together in a world that has to be confusing at times to someone who has grown up in such seclusion for so long. I was a foster mom, and have adopted children, and know what children go through in tough circumstances.  My heart goes out to Jaycee and her family, and would be proud to count them as my friends. Love and prayers to you and your family, Jaycee!
B003WTE886|5.0|8 Yr old listen to cd over & over again. It's nice to not have to worry about what songs she's hearing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had been resisting reading this book for almost a year because I heard it was similar to the Twilight series, which was one series I never quite understood the obsession with. But then my book club chose The Hunger Games for the next book, and I knew I had to finally give in and read it.    Well I'm glad I did. Within the first 10 pages, I was hooked and could barely put this book down. It's suspenseful, romantic, generally unpredictable, and most importantly, engaging. The author makes it easy to see yourself in the speaker, to relate to her world, through descriptive language about her emotions and the world she lives in. Despite violence going on all around the main character, she manages to maintain an innocence and sweetness that makes you want to jump right into the story, fighting on her side.    I'm definitely not in the age range this series was intended for, but I think that's part of the beauty of this book - it's written so that multiple generations will be able to relate to it through the basic human emotions.    I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of the series!
B004EPYZPI|2.0|I read several reviews on this site before buying this movie, and I'm really starting to think I need to stop making that the basis for my movie purchasing decisions.  Do other reviewers on here work for the movie studio that released this?  (Spoiler alert)  Let's not even waste our time with the plausibility of this movie... It's just dumb.  The defense lawyer gets a conscience and wants to do the 'right thing' because he discovers his client really is a bad guy?  I mean, duh...  Defense lawyers defend those types of people...     I don't really care about the premise of the film.. The bottom line is it was boring.  The movie was about as well written as a crime drama you'd see on Fox.  It was entertaining enough to sit through once, but I'll never watch it again and the \\"surprise ending\\" wasn't all that surprising.    Rent this one...
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This review has one slight spoiler in terms of what the brothers hunt in a single episode... you've been warned<br /><br />This season of Supernatural gives us a dose of comedy many probably wouldn't expect from a show that is \\"scary\\". But the scary ramps up too. Everything escalates. The plot of Season One is extended greatly as Sam tries to track down others 'like him'. We get great guest stars (Katharine Isabelle from the Ginger Snaps films; Linda Blair.... LINDA BLAIR! from the Exorcist)and we witness the come back of one who becomes a fan favourite: Jim Beaver's Bobby Singer. We also see what became fan favourite episodes such as 'Heart' (werewolf alert), 'What is and What Should Never Be' (djinns), and &lt;SPOLIERS>  ----- 'Tall Tales' (a Trickster, a la Coyote, Anansi, Loki, etc)&lt;/SPOILERS)>.<br /><br />Religion comes to a head, and it is easy to see that it is going to intrinsic to future episodes. Hindu and Muslin faith enters center stage, and they do it well, given as much or more reverence than the Catholic and Christian dogma. Perhaps the greatest achievement of  this season is that the writers merge the 'monster of the week' theme by making those monster hunts have some allusion to the metaplot or even fuel the the on-going episodes. So just a head's up: the show is quickly veering into theological discovery. But - they are smart enough not to shove it down anyone's throat.<br /><br />Now, for the fun stuff: the CGI is outright brilliant this season, and it only gets better as the season go on. The audio is set for 5.1 Dolby Digital. As for Special Features, they are the ho-hum variety but made oh some not ho-hum by the crew and cast. It is easy to see these guys love their work. We have a few commentary tracks, deleted scenes on a few of the episodes, a 'making of' in regards to the second jaw-dropping finale.<br /><br />This show is just getting started.
B000OY8NII|3.0|I bought season 1 based on the gushing reviews on this site and recommendation from my mother-in-law.    I hope it gets better.  My wife and I are about 1/2 way through the first season right now and we don't see what's so great about this show.  Entertaining?  Barely...  Mildly diverting?  Sure...    The storylines aren't all that compelling.  The acting is, as the title of my review says, \\"Meh!\\"  The sheriff's character is neutered and has basically no authority since the 'Global Dynamics' guys always override his crime investigations with, \\"Sorry, this is a Sector 5 thing... classified.\\"  What's the point of having a sheriff?  If I was that guy, I'd walk off the job and flip off management while doing it...  As for the \\"comedy\\" aspect of the show... Not.  The banter that's supposed to be comedic is just flat and not funny. \\"Whoa ho ho... that's a knee slapper...\\"  I guess if I want science and comedy together, I should stick with Big Bang Theory.     I'll keep giving this show a chance, but if season 1 doesn't get a whole lot better quick, I won't be wasting my $$$ on season 2.  Frankly I'm stunned at all the 5-star reviews on Amazon.  I guess others here have a relatively low threshold for what they consider good entertainment.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital: How to Self-Publish and Why You Should by David Gaughran is a book you should read, regardless of whether you intend to self-publish or not.    There are many who still line up in the traditional-publishing vs. self-publishing tug-of-war, vowing a to-the-end throw down over which is best. But increasingly, as the E-Revolution wears on, authors aren't choosing traditional-pub vs. self-pub - they're doing BOTH. Traditionally published authors are self-publishing their backlists (one of my favorites is Arthur Slade, who helpfully posts charts and stuff). Self-published authors are being offered traditional publishing deals (here's the latest). Authors are self-pubbing some books while waiting in the traditional publishing trenches (see my recent interview with Kris Yankee).    Everyone has a stake in understanding this new self-publishing movement.    The second half of Gaughran's book is a comprehensive how-to for self-publishing, and I recommend that part for those who are heading down that path. But the first half of the book, while making a strong case for why you should self-publish, is actually a concise analysis of the E-Revolution. As such, I think everyone would benefit from reading it. This in particular struck me as the game-changing part of the self-publishing movement:  \\"But what (traditional publishing advocates) don't realize is that the rise in self-publishing is good for them too. If you are a trade-published writer with no interest in self-publishing, the increased viability of self-publishing is good for you...With up to 70% royalty rates available through self-publishing, from now on, every time an author negotiates with a publishing house, the publisher will know that the author has another option.\\"  When in negotiations, having other options always strengthens your hand. Many authors may not seriously consider self-publishing, but the industry as a whole knows the option is there.    Whatever path you choose, it pays to know howthe game is being played.
0307474275|4.0|Many people seem to hate this book because it lacks flowery language and fails to tell us the meaning of life, like most \\"great works\\" of literary fiction.  However, this is merely criticizing an apple for not being an orange.  Dan Brown didn't set out to be the next James Joyce, Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, etc.  Brown set out to write a fast-paced, bestselling page-turner, and who can deny that he reached his goal.  This book is a quick, fun read, keeping you guessing and speeding you along past twists and turns.  He raises intriguing possibilities with the way he's incorporated religious assumptions into this high-powered mystery thriller.<br /><br />So, if you hate fast-paced thrillers, then do I even need to tell you not to read this book?  However, if you do read this book, then don't knock it simply because it doesn't try really hard to be the pretentious, high-brow stuff.  If you happen to prefer to sit around, sipping wine, listening to classical music, and reading esoteric fiction that you probably don't even understand anyways, then so be it.  But don't think that snobby book you're clutching is fantastic, simply because it's the consensus and you don't have enough of your own mind to think otherwise.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This album is really great but, I don't think this was actually a remastered CD. It is rather strange sound quality, with some songs clear and some with a fuzzy background noise. Honestly, it doesn't interfere with anything, it's just that the little slip thing clearly states remastered. The songs on here are very odd and about half of them are, or were major hits. This seems to be a slightly overrated album but, it's still one of my favorite Beatles releases. The truth is, if you want this one on CD, I'm not sure how much it really matters if you get remastered, or the original - there does not seem to be enough of a restoration job done. But, it's worth getting one way or another, trust me!

Using it on my 3g Xoom and it works great once you configure your router (mine netgear) also works outside of the home wifi again after you configure your router. l recommend it on the Xoom. The operation of moving your pointer is wayyy smoother than the non HD version.
1451629184|5.0|Wow is about all I can say.  This book left me speechless with a lump in my throat.    The abuses that were literally poured out onto an 11 year old girl recounted in the book honestly and really plainly proved torturous to read all in one sitting.  I found I had to put the book down between areas just to recover.    Yet by the end of the book you feel her love of life, her hope and her healing.    Though very hard to read at the beginning this is definitely a must read.    ....and I hope the Garridos rot in you know where for what they have done.  If there's any situation that would support capital punishment - this would be it.

0553801473|4.0|I finished A Dance with Dragons a few weeks ago after reading books 1 through 4 just over a year earlier.  When I logged on to see the reviews for the book I decided to sort them by date and I found that all negative reviews are overwhelmingly \\"helpful\\" and all positive reviews overwhelmingly \\"unhelpful\\".  Is there a cult of anti-GRRM reviewers just sitting at their computers clicking unhelpful at every reviewer who liked this book?  Seriously, get a life and move on.  If you didn't like the book then fine, that's your opinion and you are welcome to it.  So write your scathing review about how George has turned into a cash cow, and about how bad the editing is, and how nothing at all happens in the book, and then move on with your lives.  By sitting around and bumping up all of the negative reviews it just proves that you care so much about this series (good or bad) that you feel the need to stalk the review page night and day to leave your feedback.  So don't bother saying that you are done with the series, because you know darn well that you will be first in line at the bookstore when book 6 is released.<br /><br />  If that first paragraph made you angry, then just go ahead and click \\"unhelpful\\" but if you are just going to sit here all day anyway then you might as well read the rest of my review.  Are there any Tolkien fans out there?  I ask because most people don't recall that the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings took 12 years to write.  That's right, it took Tolkien 12 years to write 4 books.  Sound familiar?  The fact is that the time it took to write a series means absolutely nothing when the series is finally completed.  60 years after the completion of The Lord of the Rings, it is held as the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.  When all is said and done, and GRRM has finally finished A Song of Ice and Fire, it will be held up as the best fantasy series since Tolkien, and I have absolutely no doubt about that.  The reason for the disappointment is because each individual book can not meet the reader's expectations after such a long wait between books.  If you had just finished The Two Towers after a 4 year wait I'm sure you would be disappointed with that too, and how nothing got resolved.  That fact is that no one read Tolkien as the books were being released.  What must have seemed a curse at the time turned into a blessing, as Tolkien's works became popular in the 70's and people read the books all at once, judging them as one large work.  The same thing will happen with GRRM when the Song is finally completed and people start to read the series as one large work, without long waits and building expectations between books.<br /><br />  Sorry for the rambling review, but I (gasp) actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons.  Was it as good as books 1 through 3?  No not quite, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  Was it better then book 4?  Yes it was, and it is also head and shoulders above 99 percent of all other fantasy, period.  GRRM will finish the Song at his own pace, and when it is all finally completed, Dance will have its own special place in the series.  It is a book of transition and growth.  It is a book where Westeros recovers from the War of the Five Kings.  It is a book where Jon and Dany learn that with leadership comes great responsibility and hardship.  It is a book where despicable characters are redeemed, and where villainous ones grow even more hated in the reader's mind.  It is a book that held me like no other book I had read in the past year and it reminded me of why I love this series so darn much.  I will admit that I was a little disappointed in the end.  Not disappointed in the Dance itself, but disappointed that I would have to wait a very long time to see the final fates of my favorite characters.  However, I am confident that, 20 years from now, I will be sitting contently in a cozy chair next to a warm fire, revisiting the events of this beautiful series after it is finally completed, and the agony and disappointment of waiting between books will be nothing but a distant memory.y and disappointment of waiting between books will be nothing but a distant memory.

B001RE9HF2|5.0|this is a brilliant production in every way, and impossible to fault. there are many excellent reviews of this already, so i only want to add my voice to the chorus of praise. to be sure, daniele de niese is a shining star - her performance is infused with a delightful, palpable charm and sexuality (and she's so hot!) - but that's not to detract from the shimmering constellation of stars on display in this production, from performers, to musicians, to conductor, to designer, to director. everyone involved in this production hit their straps. and of course handel's music is sublime. quite a few times i got up and started applauding, only to realise i was sitting at home. this is fun, exciting and entertaining stuff. exactly what opera should be. i cannot praise this highly enough. i have now bought 4 glyndbourne productions, and each one is as outstanding as the next. i daresay they are not capable of a bad production. this is a long opera, but the time just flies by. i had an ear-to-ear grin from start to finish, telling myself what an inspired purchase this was. do yourself a favour, and add it to your collection - right now!
0553801473|2.0|I love this series but this book was a real let down.  GRRM has way too many story lines going on to keep the reader interested.  As with each of the previous books in these series, GRRM jumps from character to character with each chapter.  Usually this is not a bad way to write a book and usually it is keeps the reader enterained.  Sadly this is not the case.  The bigest problem is that nothing remotely interesting happens in any of the chapters and with jumps between so many different story lines the book becomes a complete agony to read. Unless you are a die hard Dance of the Dragons fan don't both giving it a read and only if you have a large bottle of asprin nearby.

0679722610|5.0|Red Harvest, originally published in 1929, is Hammett's first full-length novel featuring the nameless \\"Continental Op\\", a private detective employed by the fictional Continental Detective Agency. This book and Hammett's other Continental Op stories are based on his real life experience working for the Pinkertons. Red Harvest and the Continental Op, along with Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe series are the \\"fathers\\" of hard-boiled private-eye fiction.    Attempting to outline, let alone explain the plot of this book, is difficult and describing it as convoluted is an understatement. When our hero arrives in Personville, aka Poisonville, for a case, he finds the mining town a cesspool of corruption, embroiled in a life and death struggle with rival gangs, hoodlums, grifters and crooked cops all vying for the top of this squalid, but lucrative heap and their piece of the financial pie.     Our nameless hero insinuates himself into the middle of this mess playing the warring factions against each other with double crosses, misinformation and manipulation. (This storyline of the lone gunman in a corrupt town the precursor/basis for Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Clint Eastwood's A Fistful of Dollars and Bruce Willis' Last Man Standing.)    Written 80+ years ago this story still has a modern flavor - particularly the violence as well as the smarmy characters and their less than stellar motivations. If you're a fan of the PI genre, pick up Red Harvest to see where and how it all began.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|\\"Inland Empire\\" (2007) is directed by David Lynch. This provocative movie is a nightmarish labyrinth that follows actor Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) through a hallucinatory world. Jeremy Irons portrays a director filming Nikki Grace, though what is being filmed and what is hallucination, or who's point of view we are seeing is often skewed and interweaving. The film blends Lynch's interest with a decadent Hollywood boulevard, and surroundings, with a dark and dangerous foreign Polish world. After about the first hour Lynch cuts the seemingly real world anchors as we begin to feel the grip of this strange world and are plunged into a ever increasing schizophrenic madness. It is a strangely beautiful and at times horrific world.<br /><br />This double dvd set also has over 211 minutes of special features including over one hour of missing scenes, a forty minute interview with David Lynch about his thoughts on the filming of the \\"Inland Empire\\", some filming of the movie process, and a short film showing Lynch cooking quinoa while telling some stories about his travels in Europe. \\"Inland Empire\\" was evidently filmed using a video camera and so the film has the jaggies and lower resolution one might expect to see on a VHS tape.
B005DESVPO|1.0|If you've heard a blues song before this is nothing new. Same old same old generic 1 - 4 - 5 chord progressions with the same old same old stock meter in the verses. This is akin to a paint by numbers picture.     Just another recycling of the recycled. It's sad that someone can't take the blues influences and create something new & original rather than regurgitate exact copies of what has been done to death.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This movie is awesome! It has a lot of dirty dark humor, and my style of comedy. I love body changing movies, and this one does it right. Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds were perfect as each other. Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a man who spends too much time at work and doesn't spend time with his family. Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, Dave's lazy slacker friend and a man-child playboy. When they pee into a magic fountain they wish they had each others' lives. The next morning, Dave is in Mitch's body, and Mitch is in Dave's body. They go back to the fountain to see that it has been moved. They are forced to pretend to be each other until they are switched back. Dave is forced to be in a porno, while Mitch is forced to change baby diapers. They must work together to switch back and change their lives for the better. I highly recommend THE CHANGE-UP!!!
1933952806|5.0|Every thing you always wanted to know about your Nikon D7000 explained in an easy to read manner.  Very informative and in a relaxed and friendly manner.  Darrell has written a wonderful book that answers your questions without being dry and boring.  I have read several D7000 books and now, with Darrell's book I understand several things about HDR, U1 and U2, that I just couldn't quite figure out from the other books. The Kindle version has a few limitations in the graphics, that are the fault of the Kindle, not the authors.  I have this book on my iPad, Kindle and PC, and it's a great reference to have available all the time.  If you have a Nikon D7000, buy it now, you won't regret it.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|Now this is my style of comedy. It has a great plot, hilarious dialog, awesome actors and a good amount of action. Eisenberg stars as Nick, a pizza delivery driver who never delivers the pizza in time. He hangs out with his friend, Chet and get drunk. On the other side of town are Dwayne and Travis, two slacker friends want money and try to open a tanning salon/brothel. Dwayne decides to hire a hit-man to kill his rich dad, but he needs $100,000 to do so. At random, they get Nick to deliver them a pizza, but they knock him out and strap a bomb to his chest. If he doesn't rob a bank within ten hours, they will detonate the bomb. Nick asks Chet help him in robbing the bank. (The scene when they're robbing the bank is hilarious!) Will Nick get the money to Dwayne before times runs out? If you want a dirty dark comedy, you'll love 30 MINUTES OR LESS!!

B003L77GRO|4.0|This season follows immediately on the heels of Season 4, starting at the very end of the last season of the season finale of Season 4, and as far as I can tell, ends 1-2 months later.    Certain elements of this season are outstanding, others not quite as good as other seasons.    Julia Stiles and the new nemesis(es) that come with her provide an excellent contrast to \\"Dexter vs X\\" of previous seasons. She can pull off damaged and weird (she should have been a David Lynch favorite), and after a seemly late introduction in the season evolves from being a victim to something else with the help of Dexter. What she is evolving into is the big question of the season.    Peter Weller makes an appearance (he seems to follow Manny Coto from show to show), but ultimately disappointing. He's an evil flower in the Dexterverse that should have had a chance to grow into something that reaches beyond this storyline. I lay on Peter's shoulders giving this season a 4 instead of a 5, not for what he brought to the season but that he was introduced and underused.    Christina Robinson (Astor, Rita's daughter) gets much more screentime and she demonstrates what a great young actress she is becoming. She isn't simply the difficult pre-teen of previous seasons but someone you will hope to see more of in the future.    James Remar (Dexter's dad / Dark Passenger Persona) doesn't appear as much in this season, but when he appears its absolutely relevant to the ongoing plot. If you are like me and you miss those great flashbacks to when Dexter and Deb were kids, you will still be left wanting.    I am feeling a bit sorry for Geoff Pierson (Captain Matthews) this season, because he's given little to do. We learned in previous seasons that he's witheld quite a few secrets in, and that he has very different relationships with different characters. There is a potential story here that's going to waste.    This season won't make a lot of sense if you haven't been with Dexter from the beginning,because the events of the season are entirely the result of the first four. If you are a Dexter fan, you simply cannot miss this season, and my few complaints won't stop you from thoroughly enjoying it.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|This is 52 discs, so it really can't be reviewed adequately in an interview of reasonable length, so what follows should be understood to be inadequate.<br /><br />You get tracks covering the '30s to the '50s, and there are 100 artists.  You cannot really digest this collection, which I snagged for $85', in a week or two, but you can get a glimpse.  Most discs give you tw artists, but Bessie Smith, BB., Robert Johnson and several artists merit full discs.  Most discs have 20 tracks and run, on average, over 50 minutes.<br /><br />The sound is never unpleasant, but the limitations of the recordings in years past are sometimes an annoyance.  You won't get some of the signature songs, but most artists are afforded enough tracks that you get a taste of their styles.<br /><br />The alphabetic pairings of artists do make for jarring listening, but, as an example, you do get 20 tunes equally divided on one disc from both Sonny Boys, which makes for tasty listening.<br /><br />Lots of women, Big Maybelle and Memphis Minnie and Sippie Wallace are here, along with the Empress.  I am more well-schooled in the mainstream, Chess Records from the '50s is what I have real knowledge of, but this opens a complete new world, mostly Southern and acoustic, really showing that Robert Johnson was part of a community as well as a pioneer.<br /><br />This would have been a bargain if it contained half the number of discs for the price, but this is a monster and if you want to explore the blues, start here.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I loved this book!  As an author and book marketing consultant of primarily non-fiction how-to books I found Mr. Locke's approach refreshing.  It is one thing to market how-to information to identifiable market niches as is fairly easy to do with how-to titles but fiction work... that is another animal.  John Locke outlines exactly how he did it and best of all you can access his wisdom for a trifling $4.99.  If you are a fiction writer I can't think of a more \\"sure thing\\" investment than this book.<br /><br />Daniel Hall, Author
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I just finished reading the book last night and so I had to go pick up this dvd today. Well, I just finished watching this movie version of Jane Eyre and I did NOT enjoy it.  I thought this would be like the updated Pride & Prejudice but it's not.  It leaves out soo much of the story and it doesn't fully develop the characters so that you can't really connect with them.  This movie would only make sense if you had read the book.  The 1996 version of Jane Eyre (which you can stream on Netflix) is A LOT better. I like that this version is updated but it only scratches the surface of the book.  My advice is to rent it first before purchasing.
0553801473|5.0|Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Despite the views of many here, I am one of those poor misguided fools who loved this book. For me this book is about people trying to do the right thing in a world that rewards the opposite. The majority of the main characters want to do what they think is right but circumstances are against them. I loved the heartbreaking scene of Dany visiting the Astopori refugees, feeding them, washing them, then deciding she had no option but to lock them out of the city. What amazing parallels with the state of the world today - The African famine crisis, boat people etc. Jon's struggles with leadership, defending the wall with few resources. Tyrion's journey through the morass of guilt. Where else in fantasy can you find this level of emotional and ethical complexity?<br /><br />But what resonated most of all for me was Bran's brief but amazing journey towards becoming a greenseer. I had a daughter who tragically died last year. She was severely disabled, trapped in a body that would not work. I could not read about Bran without thinking about her. \\"You will never walk again ... But you will fly.\\" I love those words. Even though she is gone, they give me hope.<br /><br />I understand people's frustrations with this book. But FFC and DWD detail a point of transition between two wars. They show what is at stake and what will most likely be lost when the shite really hits the fan. It's going to be a long wait, but I am sure it will be worth it.<br /><br />Ps. GRRM is not paying me either.
B002ZG9800|2.0|Hmm, I have an idea...let's make a real-life movie where the lead character is a total gay liar and in the end, we'll completely make a mockery of those who have, and have died of, AIDS.  Are you kidding me??  This movie is kind of funny and very touching at points but there's way too much vulgarity and sex than was needed.  The ending (his final lie) is such an insult.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Great thriller, I can usually can figure out where the plots is leading  in a movie but was unable to with this one. So that's a plus in my book. Loved it
0553805371|4.0|An interesting overview of theoretical physics, quantum theory and cosmology.  Of the 3 questions:    Why is there something rather than nothing?   Why do we exist?   Why this particular set of laws and not some other?    it gives scientific answers with explanation and theory.  However, we get the sense that the philosophical questions still linger, and are not really answered by knowing the scientific explanations.  That said, it is hard to say what kind of answer we are looking for, and if it can be found, that would satisfy our asking these type of questions.    Nice book with plenty to think about for scientists, philosophers and the curious.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|It is a fun, uplifting movie. If you are a baby boomer it has special significance. If you are younger, well you can have a good time learning a bit about what it was like to be one and the child of one. I LIKE IT !   ...Oscar
B004G600A4|5.0|My granddaughter begged me to get her this movie for her third birthday.  They didn't have it at our local Walmart, but said they could order it for me.  I told them I would get back to them, because I knew I could order it cheaper from Amazon.  I was right, it was about $4.oo cheaper and took less time to get here.  She opened it and told me it was her favorite present.  She watches it almost everyday, and I watch it with her when I am there.  It's a very cute movie that kids and adults can enjoy together.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If you like action movies you will like this one. And it has a depth of character development and plot well beyond the usual action movie. Brad Pitt is great as Achilles. The same goes for whoever plays Agamenon and the entire cast. It is also a long movie that holds your attention and is never boring. A real winner if you like action movies.   ...Oscar
B004LWZVZC|5.0|Texican and I rented this Video-On-Demand from Suddenlink  the other night. It's a 24-hour rental for $3.99. A bargain when you consider that I never even had to start the car up to rent it! Simply a couple of clicks on my cable remote, and I was watching this movie!<br /><br />James McAvoy stars as a Union Veteran cum attorney, Frederick Aiken, who is given the unlikely task of defending Mrs. Mary Surrat, a woman charged with conspiring to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln [Mary Surrat was played by none other than Robin Wright]. Both McAvoy and Wright were logical choices for the parts played; both excellent actors and skilled in their own right. However, these parts couldn't have been written with any one else in mind, so well did they fill the roles taken on!<br /><br />Robin Wright portrayed the harrangued and misunderstood Mary Surrat to perfection! The most touching scene of all coming at the end when Surrat is being lead to the gallows. Wright's portrayal of a woman in shock, and final acceptance of what she faced was spectacular! Likewise, McAvoy's portrayal during this was one of abject horror at the attorney's inability to save a woman who, guilty or not mattered not to him, did not receive the justice of a fair trial in the entire case.<br /><br />Lincoln's assassination and the trials of the accused following, have always held a special interest to me, in that they mirror the death and what followed in the Kennedy assassination; an occurrence in my own lifetime.<br /><br />This movie is a MUST see for any history buff, as the portrayal is, indeed, layed out on historical fact.  It is a riveting film that you won't want to miss even a second of!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|If you don't have a big screen TV, buy one. If you don't have a great surround sound system, buy one. Then buy London Calling- Live in Hyde Park!  I've seen Bruce live at other venues but this tops all.  It is also a lasting memory of the Big Man, Clarence Clemons and his unique musical style. Not one clunker in the mix.
0316069884|5.0|Although the peculiarity of the title didn't occur to me until after I'd finished reading \\"Eating Animals\\", it now seems so obvious why the title wasn't, say, \\"Eating Meat\\":  Foer views the eating of meat the equivalent of eating a once living, breathing, feeling, pain-suffering, and sensing animal.  Many people are able to disconnect the two, but Foer is not.  Foer admits that he grew up wavering between being a happy carnivore and a fare-weather vegetarian but it wasn't until he became a father that he earnestly started to consider the consequences and implications of meat-consumption.  Foer focuses most of the book discussing the factory farm industry, the evolution of agri-business, and the conditions under which virtually all farm animals are raised in the United States.  And he paints a disturbing and pessimistic picture.  Foer is, obviously, a firm believer in vegetarianism and its many benefits and he could have become evangelical in his tone -- but he didn't -- and the book is all the better for it.  Our relationship with food is important and, as Foer makes pretty clear, should also be deliberate.
0553801473|5.0|I loved this book. Any book with Tyrion is five star material if you ask me. Martin can write like nobody's business. I also don't see what is wrong with Dany's story? I guess we can crack it up to different strokes for different folks. I will be back for 6 and 7. If he writes it I will be back for 8.
0783241569|2.0|Notting Hill is a very overrated and mediocre film.  1999 was a very strong year for films but this was not one of them.  Roberts and Grant played themselves and that is about it.  Its a wacky British drama that is totally unrealistic and not very believable.  I was glad when it was over.  No movie star is going to pick up a book seller in England and then marry them.  I agreed with the film's portrayal of the media but that was done better in films like Network and SFW.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|You will like this app, and it is useful, but the one flaw I have found is that it will freeze at times and the only way to recover is to go into your applications management and force it to close.  Then you can reopen it. I have not found the battery issue someone else mentioned, but I suspect that it is still open in the background for that user, which is related to the issue I mentioned.<br /><br />To give you a specific example, I have used this to stream audio from 8am to 5pm, 5 days a week, and once each day it freezes. This seems to coincide with other android functions, like if you get a phone call, or if your tablet display goes to \\"sleep\\". When you wake the screen, this app doesn't recover about 60% of the time, so you will have to restart it.<br /><br />That said, if you want the ability to listen to thousands of radio stations, you will like this app. I do recommend it even with the issues of freezing occasionally. Even on 3G connections, it works. I have tested this on a tablet and on a phone, and both work just as well. It does record audio extremely well. I don't have any problem recording, even talk shows that are 3 hours long. You can choose favorites, and if you are looking for specific shows, it will list them and then every stream available for you to try. A LOT of features in this little app.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is the best streaming app available, and even with the occasional freezing issue, (which I think is more an Android issue then an app specific issue), this is worth your money. I don't want to over emphasize the freezing issue over the great functionality of this app. On both phone and tablet the volume is great, it resizes and looks GREAT on the tablet by the way, and will impress others.<br /><br />UPDATE: Newer versions don't seem to have a freezing problem. Now raised my review. Excellent app.
0767819594|3.0|Cruel Intentions is a good film contrary to popular belief.  It is not a great film but better than some of the films in the same genre that came out at that time such as:  The In Crowd and Notting Hill.  The film looks at the shallowness of the rich and others that is prevalant in our bars, dance clubs and in the mass culture in general.  If you do not like Gellar, Phillipe, or Witherspoon do not even waste your time with this film.  It is primarily a character study of Ryan Phillipe's character Sebastian.  The plot is not spectacular but better than the In Crowd (2000).  I am looking forward to seeing the sequels.

0553801473|5.0|A Dance With Dragons is fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series and I am hooked, lock stock and barrel.  In this installment, the first 60% of the book covers the same time period as that covered in a Feast for Crows but focuses on things taking place outside of Westeros -- at the Wall and beyond and in the Free Cities.  The last 40% sees the two parallel tracks merge together and move forward.  The immensity of the vision required for this series is beyond belief.  New characters continue to be introduced, including a few that likely will be central to the plot moving forward.  Although this book lacks the relentless plot punches of the third installment, Storm of Swords, there are enough jaw-dropping moments to satisfy even the most blood thirsty, including two unforgettable scenes involving the dragons.<br /><br />Among the things I love about this series are: (1) complicated, three-dimensional characters that can be loved (or hated) with passion; (2) intricate political intrigue with endless twists and turns; (3) an amazingly vivid, original fantasy world with more nuances than you can count; (4) heroes, villains, underdogs, vipers, champions, animals, feats of valor....the list goes on and on.  The unforgettable characters in this series include:  Jon Snow, bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark and the current Lord High Commander of the Night's Watch, desperate to wear the mantle of power with honor and grace; Arya Stark, Jon's half-sister, hidden in Braavos while she learns who she is and where her destiny will lead her; Danaerys Targaryen, Blood of the Dragon, gathering power and the strength to take back the Iron Throne ripped from her family in blood; Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, exiled from the Seven Kingdoms after being branded a king- and kin-slayer, hunted by his evil sister Cersei, mother to King Tommen, for whom no amount of power would ever be enough; and, of course, the animals, including Ghost, direwolf and familiar of Jon Snow; and the three dragon \\"children\\" of Danaerys -- Dhrogon, Viserion and Rhaegal.  All of these and many more are woven into the intricate tapestry that is this series.  I could read these books forever.  Opening the cover and starting to read is like diving into a deep pool and feasting your eyes on an aquarium of the most amazing creatures you can imagine.  I can't even fathom how George R.R. Martin keeps the worlds, people, histories and back stories of each and every complex character straight.  If he keeps going for 10 more books, I am in.\\"children\\" of Danaerys -- Dhrogon, Viserion and Rhaegal.  All of these and many more are woven into the intricate tapestry that is this series.

1932100660|5.0|I first read this book nearly five years ago and as a result I immediately became a vegan and have remaind so. I was already a vegetarian and the information in this book was so compelling that I knew I could never go back to being simply a vegetarian who also ate dairy and eggs. Excellent book.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I never thought my home theater set-up had lag until I tried this. I had been trying to beat the last tactical challenge in Vanquish for over a month now, playing it every day (call me a loser or whatever, I get obsessive when the challenge is exciting). I consider myself a hardcore gamer (check out my PSNID: libou_is_on_fire to judge for yourself), and for those who know the game, the Vanquish challenges are really up there in terms of difficulty. I have been traveling a lot lately, and had to play my PS3 on several different TVs. I was surprised to find out that I played better on some TVs than on others, and I figured I was just imagining things.       Well, I hooked up my PS3 to the G155 and I could instantly tell that my reflexes were MUCH sharper. I managed to beat that friggin' Vanquish challenge in just a few tries!! The lack of lag made the difference. It may simply be due to the fact that the HDMI cord is shorter than mine, and to the fact that you are pretty much required to play inches from your PS3 (so less lag from the wireless controller as well). Either way, I don't care, this is the only way to game.      To be thorough in my review, I must point out that the speakers are a bit average, but I use headphones and the sound comes out just fine. I can even hear sounds I didn't even know where there when playing on my TV. I like the fact that I don't have to fight with my girlfriend over the TV anymore. She can watch her shows, and I can play next to her, without the sound bothering anybody.     It took me almost 2 months to make up my mind about this purchase, and I was half expecting to be disappointed, but I'm glad I went ahead and bought it. It's also less bulky than I had expected. I travel a lot, and there's a chance security guards at the airports may look at me funny (or be envious), but it's worth it.

B000002KE2|5.0|Just a short review...<br /><br />Black Sabbath - Vol. 4 (1972) is, at worst, my third favorite Black Sabbath album, behind Paranoid (1970) and Black Sabbath (1969).  Sometimes I put it in second place.  This album is vintage Black Sabbath - dark, gloomy, and with great guitar riffs from Tony Iommi.  Songs like \\"Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener\\", \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\", \\"Supernaut\\", \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Laguna Sunrise\\", and \\"Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\\" show the band's versatility with riffs and melody.  This album contains the catchy ballad \\"Changes\\", a great song that further shows the band's versatility and shows that the band does have a little bit of a softer side.  Ozzy is in top form vocally on this album.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the great Black Sabbath albums from not just the Ozzy era, but the entire history of the band.  I highly recommend it.

B000002JSR|3.0|I've been listening to LZ for years but I am not one of those types who take time to look into every aspect of their lives, history or anything else. I've always taken their music at face value, most of which is just pretty outstanding. For anyone who thinks otherwise, get a local band to play their own stuff and then try their hand at a Led Zep classic like Kashmir or Communication Breakdown and you'll see what I mean.  Actually, Wolfmother's rendition of Communication Breakdown is a fine example. Led Zepplin just kicks. Anyway...    I like most of Coda but always thought it was a little uneven, like it was from different eras or had a handful of incohesive ideas clashing together and come to find out... DUH! That's because it was! Hehehehehehe. I could live without Bonzo's Montreux (too indulgent for my tastes), but I understand it's inclusion as a tribute. I could do without the slow, bluesy stuff (namely I Can't Quit You Baby). I know LZ did a lot of that during their career and it influenced their more energetic stuff but it never appealed to me. That aside, Ozone Baby, and Walter's Walk are pretty great. Actually, Walter's Walk, though a little repetitive, is probably the standout here. Poor Tom is another standout that feels like it should be on the III or IV albums.     As for \\"We're Gonna Groove\\", the song is so great instrumentally but the lyrics just crack me up. \\"See my baby comin' down the track...\\" (OK, sounds hobo-ish but maybe sexy, then we follow it with) \\"we're gonna RAISE a family!\\" What is this, Mike Brady's (the Brady Bunch) theme song before he decided to become an architect, ditch his current wife and shack up with Carol Martin (nee' Tyler)?  The lyrics always ruin it for me. I wonder if Jimmy Page ever rolled his eyes at certain lyrics.    Anyway, I can see how this was out of place in 82 and seemingly like the corporate old guard blocking the way for the new (can anyone say U2 these days?) but can anyone blame LZ for having a market and their label wanting to cash in on that while they still could? This isn't LZ II or IV but it's not the worse thing to hit the radio either (do they even play good music on free radio anymore?). Definitely worth a listen with a few toe tappers.

B004ULNJF8|4.0|Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Based on the cover art and synopsis, Blitz looks like just another Jason Statham vehicle where our muscle-bound hero careens through London, bashing heads until he finds the killer. I was perfectly okay with that. Instead, Blitz is much more of an ensemble piece than it first appears. In addition to Statham's \\"killer cop,\\" we get his boss Porter Nash (Paddy Considine, The Bourne Ultimatum) a homosexual cop with a past; Elizabeth Falls, a friend who's just got out of rehab after a stint as an undercover drug cop; and Blitz himself (Aiden Gillean, The Wire), a compelling, smarmy killer who makes the perfect villain. It helps that all these characters are played by excellent actors.<br /><br />More importantly, this cast of characters allows Blitz to tell a story that's a little more complicated than \\"catch the killer.\\" Obviously finding Blitz is the central story here, but the film weaves in police violence and corruption, the media's complicity in that violence, drug addiction, homosexuality, and burnout. Of course the film doesn't have the most original things to say about these issues, but it's nice to see a cop film that isn't afraid to balance the action with a bit of intellect. The multiple storylines also allow the film to build tension in the main story. The audience knows who the killer is very early on (and the cops find out not much later). By weaving the other stories into the capture of Blitz, the film builds tension by not proceeding to the obvious showdown between good guys and bad guy. Still, it wouldn't be a Jason Statham film without him kicking in some heads and cracking wise. Blitz doesn't ignore those moments, offering some satisfying cracks from Statham, both physical and verbal.<br /><br />Blitz comes to Blu-ray with a solid AVC-encoded transfer. The film was shot with a lot of wide angle lenses and the picture can get a bit soft around the edges, though that's probably a deliberate choice and not a failing of the transfer. In general, though, detail is strong, and colors are well-saturated. Black levels are consistent and deep, and grain crops up appropriately in a few places. The DTS-HD surround track is fine as well, offering clear dialogue from the center channel, and a bit of atmosphere in the surrounds. The low end gets some use, but not as much as many action films. Subtitles are included for those who have trouble with British accents. Extras include some interviews with the cast and crew and a roll of behind-the-scenes footage. We also get the film's U.K. theatrical trailer.<br />-Full review at dvdverdict.comIn general, though, detail is strong, and colors are well-saturated.

0749942010|2.0|After reading a synopsis of Sister by Lupton, I rushed to order a copy from Amazon.com.  I found the story to be intriguing, but without giving away the ending I was disappointed in the conclusion.  After stringing the reader along on a roller coaster ride of false suspects and red herrings, I felt the ending came abruptly and conveniently.  The book was too long and redundant, and Lupton spent too much time dragging out the story without purpose.  The dialogue was too British for me using informal vocabulary which left an American reader like me distracted.  Lupton constructed a too-complicated plot with heavy handed foreshadowing and too many insignificant characters.  As a reader I found it hard to suspend disbelief for the length of the book written in the format of a witness giving a statement.  The statement lasted days with lunch breaks and too much personal impressions which had nothing to do with the advancement of the plot.  The characters lacked depth and realistic emotion. The hints at romance were clumsy and unbelievable which the narrator related from her intuitions about behavior the reader couldn't have fathomed.  I was disappointed .

We all think it is just too short, we all want more.

1596062754|5.0|Filled with lots of wry humour and with plans that almost never worked out as intended, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which gave me many a chuckle. While the book harks back mainly to the first book in the trilogy (which is appropriate, given the story is told from the perspective of the same main character in both books), it can be enjoyed equally as a stand alone book or as a fitting end to a great trilogy.  Do yourself a favour though and read ALL the books in the series.    I only have one question - what ever happened to the werewolves?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a voice! Only two rockers but the rest of the songs are lazy afternoon wine drinking relaxing type songs. If she wrote all of them you can tell she's been hurt/dumped by a lover in the past. That lilting voice combined with the melody makes the lyrics have double impact. If 19 is as good, I would buy that one too.

Well, this movie was able to take me somewhere dark, I thought it was funny that my hometown was mentioned in the movie (Hagerstown).  It left me feeling...down.  Not saying the movie was not good, infact it is very good. The director was able to capture that sense of hopelessness that I rarely feel when watching a horror movie. I got loss in the journey.  It's a little like \\"The Walking Dead\\" but not really.  I felt for these individuals.  Will be watching this again to see if it hold up over time.

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|There is no need to tell you how good the movie is. it is an excellent movie and is a truly epic classic. i was however dissapointed with the blu ray quality. i have a ps3 and a 1080p 42\\" tv and the image was very digitized (could see pixels). some shots looked good while others were painful. overall i recommend the movie to anyone but would probably buy the dvd version.
030726999X|5.0|So, I dove into \\"....kicked the hornets nest\\" after I was completely enamored by \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\". I read the first book. Went to netflix to watch the movie and loved it so much that I watched all 3 of the millennium series movies. I know that movies and books both offer different perspectives. So I decided to read the rest of the series. Needless to say, I enjoyed the book far moire than the movie. Different twists. It was an amazing climax that was far more in depth and mentally stimulating. I recommend 100 times over. Just read \\"...Dragon tattoo\\" and \\"....played with fire\\" first.<br /><br />xoxo<br />-Lizzie
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can't say enough about how awesome this book is. It was so good that a day after finishing it I went back and read it all over again. I was completely sucked into Beautiful Disaster--I felt like I knew the characters. I hurt when they hurt, and when they were happy, I couldn't help but smile. Jamie McGuire perfectly captures the years of college and the unique dynamic of having a relationship in those years. Every girl longs for a hero like Travis, a guy who is absolutely crazy about her--he is possessive, jealous, protective and romantic in all the right, delicious ways.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Everyone should be able to find something to enjoy about this movie, but you have to grow up in this culture to fully appreciate the nuances of this film. I remember as a child of seven or eight (in the late 50's-though the movie is set in the 60's), beaming with compassionate pride as I handed a mentally challenged, elderly, black man who did lawn work for my grandparents a pair of long johns. My aunt had purchased them for him and they often gave him hand me downs or small items. That day he was poorly dressed and the weather bitterly cold for the South. I remember that his calloused hand felt as cold as stone when he took the clothing from me. Looking back I never questioned that I was told to let him into my grandfathers freezing shed and turn on a tiny space heater so he could undress and put on his new \\"warm\\" clothes. Giving him the clothes was saintly, letting him into my grandfather's special domain kindly, letting him into the warm house to dress simply wasn't done. I never knew where he lived but it was as if this cold world was his comfort zone and we were not required to change that.<br /><br />This movie captures beautifully those kind of condescending social assumptions prevalent in parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. It was an assumption of superiority maintained in innumerable small acts of \\"kindly\\" diminishment. I still remember my mother saying that my aunt's maid, who raised her five children, stole socks. However, since she was a good maid my aunt let her \\"get away with it\\". I never knew whether this tale was truth born of poverty or the purest fiction driven by a need to enforced the social distance between them. My guess is that she found most of her socks the first time here washing machine was serviced and kept it to herself. In the end, long after her loyal servant was too old to work, she was forever remembered \\"fondly\\" as the sock thief. It was as if that made it okay not to wonder what she was living on in retirement.<br /><br />This assumption of  moral superiority is driven home in the  film when a young maid who \\"doesn't know her place yet\\" asks her rich employers for a loan of $75 dollars so she can send both of her twin sons to college. She offers to work for free until the money is paid back. The woman tells her that won't be working for free because she owes money and \\"the Lord\\" intends for her to earn it on her own. She ends my assuring her that one day she will thank her for this moral lesson. In the end the maid finds a ring long lost behind a couch and pawns it. Since no maid should have a ring like that, the authorities are called, the ring traced and maid arrested with no consideration given to the real magnitude of the crime.<br /><br />The Help, successfully renders southern paternalism with accuracy, sadness, warmth and even humor. The film captures relationships bounded by a lack of any obligation to avoid harm and the assumption that those of the lower social order fully accepted their place and wanted nothing more. Moods simply do not have to be contained by those who have the upper hand and it is more important to be seen as \\"in control\\" of another human being than compassionate. We see this in a scene where the young writer's mother fires a servant who has been with them for a lifetime. She does this because a group she is entertaining feel she is not properly \\"controlling\\" her servant.<br /><br />In the end, aside from the young writer, Skeeter, who tells the story, it is the socially ostracized \\"white trash\\" homemaker of the group who first breaks with tradition to offer humane treatment to her maid Millie. This is followed by the writer's mother who is ill and perhaps has little to lose at this point. Skeeter leaves to find her fortune far from home, an all too familiar story common to those young people who don't fit the Southern mold. But the story does not end on a sour note. What is won in the end is not the outward freedom which is still decades away, but an inner wealththat leads the audience to applaud the human spirit as the credits role.pplaud the human spirit as the credits role.

B00361DR4Q|2.0|Stay away from this one. Less than so-so performance. Neither of the 2 leading singers impressed me and the tenor is the lesser of the 2. The DVD itself has some quality issues. Some sections' audio goes on and off (I tried my other BluRay DVDs later and made sure there was no problem with my player, and the DVD itself is very clean).   I also have the 1999 DVD of Teresa Stratas & Plácido Domingo performing the same opera. Comparing the 2 DVDs breaks my heart that BluRay technology could be squandered like this, and proves yet again why Domingo is, well, Domingo.

0446571415|4.0|As an avid follower of the Camel Club I was happy when the author got this book out and gave us all another exciting episode in the life of Oliver Stone and his friends in the Camel Club. However there is just a tad less Camel Club involvement in this writing than the others and that's why I just wasn't \\"Wowed\\" as I had been with previous editions.     The story starts with a bomb explosion and gun fire in a park just across from the White House where the visiting British Prime Minister was suppposed to have walked home to get to Blair House where he was staying for the night. Fortunately, the PM has an accident while at the White House and he sprains his ankle and thus has to motorcade home avoiding the park and the detonation of the bomb. This starts the plot running as Oliver Stone, who was earlier asked by the President to rejoin government service to help find and break up a drug cartel in Mexico that may have ties to Russia. However with this latest matter the President asks Stone to redirect his attentions to find out who, as well as why, there was this attempted assination of an ally while on U.S. soil.     Stone is joined in his quest by an MI6 female agent who partners up to persue the bad guys with him. There is a lot of good investigative work which uncovers a leak in the American intelligence network and Stone is suspicious of some higher up people. While following a lead as to the the bomb, Stone is suckered into going after who he believes was the bomber only to find that he has been decoyed when a sniper kills the suspected bomber when Stone talks him out of his trailer. When Stone returns to the man's employment, a tree farm where Stone left an FBI agent in case the man had reported for work while Stone was enroute to his home, he finds that the FBI agent, the tree farm manager and his secretary have all been killed. Stone is immediately blamed for allowing the deaths to have happened and his actions are put under a microscope by the FBI. When Stoneis pulled from the case and told he could also go to jail he goes it alone with the MI6 agent to find out who killed the FBI agent and the others and what is behind the bombing. Now enter the Camel Club members to assist Stone, but thier roles are kept to a very minimum.     There are some interesting twists to the story as Stone realizes he is up against a real pro in the American intelligence network who has turned traitor and is working with the Mexican drug cartel to make it appear the Russians are the culprits. As Stone persues the traitor he also realizes that the MI6 agent is not just being his partner but also reporting back on his activities to a few others both in British intelligence as well as people at the top of the American intelligence groups. Stone uncovers the traitor and the race is on to capture the person as he again is led astray in the chase. However the story has a unique ending which involves members of the Camel Club being kidnapped and used as bait and one final revelation which the reader may or may not see coming on the closing pages.    All in all the book is definitely a page turner for the avid mystery/thriller fan. I suggest you give it a read, you won't be disappointed.
0061537969|5.0|I absolutely loved this book that gives a glimpse into Enzo's world as he reflects upon his life with his family.  Enzo starts his story when his master Denny first picks him out of a litter of pups to go and live with him.  We go through the ups and downs of both Enzo's and Denny's lives as he goes through his personal memories.<br /><br />Enzo and Denny start out as quite a carefree pair, as Denny is a bachelor that only has Enzo to care for.  Enzo watches things change quickly as Eve enters the picture and he sees the two of them fall in love.  Enzo is a smart dog though, so even though he is a bit jealous, he also sees how happy Denny is with her.  Enzo accepts Eve into their family but doesn't allow himself to get too close to her for quite some time.<br /><br />Just when Enzo thinks that he is now accustomed to this new life with Eve, they bring home Zoe, an addition to the family!  Zoe's innocence is apparent to Enzo so he easily welcomes her into their home and is eager to become her playmate.<br /><br />When the family is burdened by a crisis many members of the family turn to Enzo for comfort and strength.  Enzo takes care of his family in the best way that he can.  He watches them all struggle in their own ways and each of them tells him things that they wouldn't tell anyone else.  He really becomes a keeper of secrets and if only he could talk he would share his words of wisdom with them all.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was that Enzo really believed that he would come back as a man after he passed away.  After watching a documentary on television he believed this is what happened to exceptional dogs, if they were ready for the challenge.  Of course, since Enzo believed that he already thought like a human it was only obvious that he would become one.<br /><br />I just discussed this book with my book club a couple of weeks ago and we all absolutely loved it!  It made for a great discussion and it was even an added bonus that we had a new puppy in our household to help us get in the mood for the story!  With themes of love, honor, family, and dogs of course, this book has something to offer for various types of readers.  I highly recommend this novel for leisure reading or a book club discussion.t in the mood for the story!

1400032717|4.0|I've never met, seen, or read about anyone quite like Christopher John Francis Boone, the uniquely eccentric protagonist of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. This highly acclaimed, award winning book by Mark Haddon, tells from a first person point of view the difficulties of this socially-impaired, fifteen-year-old boy who lives with his father in Swindon. Although Christopher never discusses autism with the audience, he shows certain signs of this disorder, including mathematical genius, apathy, and the inability to understand others. Due to this syndrome, many of the details in this novel are seemingly irrelevant, such as the number of holes in someones shoes and the differences between a metaphor and a simile. However, the digressions are perhaps the most interesting reads, as they allow the reader to understand just how differently his mind functions. I also find myself chuckling over some of these moments, such as when he explains how five red cars equals a good day and wonders why the Orion is called Orion. As he struggles to navigate the world of people, his adventures help him to gradually gain independence and mature.<br /> Since it is labeled as a murder mystery novel by Christopher himself, the first half covers the death of a neighborhood dog and his quest to discover the murderer. It is from here on that he begins to gain the courage to become independent: \\"So talking to the other people in our street was brave. But if you are going to do detective work you have to be brave, so I had no choice.\\" But through his investigation, he uncovers an even deeper secret. Two years ago, his mother died of a heart attack--that's what his father said. But she's actually living in Willesden with another man. When Christopher discovers who kills the dog, his fear prompts him to confront his consternation of highly populated areas, and he takes a train alone to London to meet his mother.<br /> Mark Haddon narrates this story beautifully through Christopher's blunt voice that doesn't need to be glossed over with flowery details or superficial sympathy to get the point across. Readers will come to appreciate how realistic his view of the world is, and understand him better from his frankness in describing it: \\"And anyway, Orion is not a hunter or a coffeemaker or a dinosaur. It is just Betelgeuse and Bellatrix...and 17 other stars I don't know the names of. And they are nuclear explosions billions of miles away. And that is the truth.\\" This novel will surprise you with its twists and turns, make you laugh out loud and say, \\"I never knew that,\\" and, perhaps, call for some teary-eyed action near the end.

1439156816|5.0|Read this book in about two days.  The first half is a mini-autobiography of King's early days.  He tells us his story so we can see where he is coming from.  I could see a lot of his stories in his real life.<br /><br />The next half deals with writing itself.  King gives great advice on what to avoid and how he writes.  It was great comfort to hear that the king of horror doesn't diagram and outline every detail of his story, rather he just lets his story flow from his mind to his fingers into the computer.  I have listened to too many hacks saying how I need to create character cards and outlines etc.  Nope, not anymore I don't.<br /><br />Whether you are just wanting to write stories for fun, or if you are wanting to write a novel and get published, I highly reccomend this book.

B00278U1W0|3.0|The few of the songs Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood performed together were entertaining, but not as much as I'd hoped.  But hey, it is ERIC CLAPTON and STEVE WINWOOD after all, and my expectations may be a bit high.  Both sounded great and their duets were reminiscent of 1960 collaborations (e.g. Blind Faith).  Both are great artists in the similar veins (British blues).  My score was less due in part to the few numbers on the DVD.  I'd hoped to have more offerings, both duets and solo numbers.

0307887960|5.0|I'm 62 years old, female. My doctors have told me for years that to lose weight I'd have to start eating a balanced diet.  I seemed to live on granola bars,cheese, bananas and apples!  In other words, things that were easy to grab and go.  Some days I wouldn't eat anything till dinner time.  I was never hungry or interested in food.  Whatever I put in my mouth my body turned to fat, because it was in starvation mode all the time.   I had 20lbs to lose!  I am also wheat glutin intolerant, to complicate matters.  Anyway, I decided to try this Dukan diet.  For the first time in years I am eating 'real\\" food.  Three times a day!   I feel like I am eating SO much food it is hard to think I'm on a diet!  I am certainly losing weight, and since I started 2 weeks ago, have lost about 12lbs.  My entire body shape is changing, too.  The fat is melting off my middle (the problem area) and I feel energized and healthy.   I make sure I have the correct foods either prepared or ready to cook quickly.  I provide myself with a lot of choices, and sometimes just have a little bit of everything on my plate for variety.  I had never eaten non-fat yogurt in my life, but find that I enjoy it.  I use a little Splenda with food flavoring like lemon essence, or vanilla, or almond essence, that sort of thing, and I do mix in my oat bran to get my daily dose of that.  Tasty pudding!  I have also used the non fat yogurt to make savory dip or salad dressing (the recipes in the book give you ideas about that). Having the food ready on-hand stops the urge to grab the easy granola bar again. I do miss my fruit, but am finding that there are veggies I should have tried years ago.  I did 5 days on the attack phase, and am now on the cruise phase, (one day protein only, next day protein and veggies).  I am trying food I never used to eat.  I can see that this is nutritionally life changing for me.  My cardiologist is pleased at the weight loss, and his nurse is going on the Dukan diet too. My friends all want to know what I am doing to look so good, and I tell them to go buy the book.  They want me just to tell them what to eat, but you have to have the book and read the whole thing to know the what, why, and how of this diet.  You have to understand what happens to the food after you eat it and why this all works.  The book is essential.  If you don't follow through with each of the four phases, you will just put the weight back on.  This is about changing the way you eat for the rest of your life, and getting you to the final phase where you can eat all the foods you like with no restrictions at all (well, come on, it stands to reason that you can't pig out on fries every meal and have huge portions, etc.) but eating everything you like, still keeping the weight off!  You just have the one \\"all protein day\\" a week for the rest of your life to keep the weight off.  Simple?  Only if you have the book and understand how this all works.  Maybe if you just can't live without carbs, this diet would not be for you.  But it certainly works if you follow Dr. Dukan's plan.  It is not restrictive, no portion sizes, no calorie counting.  Just eat from the food lists, and eat enough so that you are never hungry.  Absolutely amazing!  You will not regret buying this book. It is written in engaging style and is easy to read. I have already bought a second book and have sent it to my sister as a gift.  She can't wait to get started!

B000062XFG|4.0|I was a little disappointed with this season. It's still Star Trek and it still had some interesting stories but I guess I expected a but more of a jump in quality. On the positive side, the \\"away\\" sets were a bit less cheesy than in the first season, some of the shows carried their momentum through to the end better than in the first season, a number of long-term character issues were introduced and there were some really good shows exploring the status of Data. Unfortunately, in spite of this, there were a few episodes that were real duds that most fans don't rate very highly such as the last episode with a lot of clips included and the episode where the crew gets stuck in the re-creation of a casino. Finally, I would say that while the acting and stories were generally of improving quality, there were some points where the premise of a scene was a bit preposterous. I thought the episode where Data was on trial to determine his status as a person and the show where aliens who are not that bright kidnap Geordi seemed especially hard to believe even in the Star Trek setting. In spite of some of these growing pains, most fans of the show would agree that this is a pretty solid season and that there are some beloved episodes included. The episode where the ship meets the Borg for the first time is probably considered the top episode for this season. If you are a fan of Star Trek, you will enjoy this season because it is the one where the characters really start to settle into their own and develop some of the characteristics and issues that were of interest in later seasons.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|As a fan of a number of \\"progressive\\" rock groups from the seventies and of those who still survive to this day, and as a composer of such music myself, I have learned something about one's music and one's self \\"maturing\\".  It does not always mean \\"stagnant\\" or \\"bad\\".  Songwriting evolves, the writer grows and matures, and the point often gets missed that \\"virtuoso\\" playing does not always mean \\"as many notes as possible, played as fast as possible\\".  The point of music is to evoke an emotional response and the mature writer seeks to achieve that end through all the tools in his toolbox, and \\"feel\\" becomes just as important as \\"virtuosity\\".  If fast playing achieves the \\"feel\\" that is being sought, then great; but if not, then it should rightfully take a back seat.  The idea that a band like Yes could or should sound like it did when its members were 25 years old misses the whole point of the \\"mature\\" songwriting process entirely.  Whether the song \\"Fly From Here\\" sounds like it did when they played it back in 1980 is irrelevant; whether it's as \\"good\\" now is entirely up to the taste of the listener.  I guarantee that it's been more carefully thought out now, it has gone through more of a process of \\"what are we really trying to achieve here\\" than \\"we need to make yet another proclamation of our technical prowess as players\\".  They have been there and done that, and anyone who has seen them play live knows that they have lost none of their skill as players of the very highest caliber.      \\"Fly From Here\\" is the most honest characterization of where Yes is right now as can be made; their \\"virtuosity\\" is evident in the textures of the sounds they make, the precision in how they make them, and the integrity they maintain to the \\"feel\\" of the ideas and emotions they are evoking.  They may not be \\"groundbreaking\\" entirely new musical ideas, but then again, they never were.  They were only ever making the very best music they knew how to make, in the way they knew how tomake it, and the same is true today.  For my money, this is the best CD Yes has produced at least since \\"Union\\" (which I quite liked, despite its inherent flaws), and the fact that Jon Anderson is not a part of it subtracts nothing from its overall value.  Unfortunately, it may very well be, and we will never know of course, that this CD might not have been as good had \\"the Maestro\\" been there; Trevor Horn was in control of the studio and he made the recording what it is.  What it is, is quite good.  It took me a good long while to get used to \\"Drama\\" back in 1980, and in fact I didn't like it all on its first listen, the diehard 1970's Anderson-Wakeman Yes fan that I was (and still am); but I grew to love it, and I feel this work is by its very nature of similar quality. By the way, the intent of the \\"Union\\" tour (the money-mongers notwithstanding) was not lost on me at the time; that all of its members are part of the greater Yes \\"family\\" and all can contribute or not with equal validity.  I consider \\"Fly From Here\\" to be a very strong new addition to the growing Yes family's catalog of extraordinary music.
B004DMIIOG|4.0|The first glimpse of this movie, I was expecting another great anime from Japan-it was delivered with great story telling, animation, and emotional draw that leaves any movie fan not just anime wanting more. The movie tells a story of High school teenagers who through angst, family commitment, and power overcome obstacles together through shared experiences and of course social networking. Think of FaceBook taking over the world in an official sense, but a hack breaks it, causing the world to collapse. The only downside to this well delivered drama is that at times it's marred with Hollywood and anime clich&eacute;s; these distractions remove the viewer from focusing on the plot at hand, and at certain moments the character development. Yet, that would be the only thing that I could lament that hurts the film- at best. As whole, it is still a great film that any anime and non anime lover will enjoy.
1400063515|2.0|The idea of Black Swans, infrequent events with great consequences, is the main topic of this book. I found that the author had deep and serious problems stating his examples, and his research was indeed deeply flawed.<br /><br />After having read most of Gladwell's books, this book reminds me of an idea in one of them: Blink. A Blink is the ability of an expert to be \\"natural\\", through deep training and continuous repetition of a task. An expert only has the \\"gift\\" after having practiced the same task over and over. [[ASIN:B000PAAH3K Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]. This gift, research has shown, is common to military strategists and stock traders. Oddly enough, the same thinkers Nassim takes as empiricists and knowers of the real world.<br /><br />It just happens that much of what Nassim thinks is an empiric way of thinking is nothing but the \\"blink\\" of having been deeeply trained all over the years on different situations and environments.<br /><br />Nassim's theory falls apart when we do a deep analysis of the 2008 financial crisis. Clearly explained in [[ASIN:0393072231 The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine]] by Lewis. This traders shortsightedness and confidence in their own abilities, prevented them from considering the possible downfall of the mortgage market (since it never happened before, Ha! a Black Swan). Thus putting in clear evidence, that this traders Nassim cherishes so much are perhaps even greater victims to black swans. Yet in the book, we can see how people with deep analytic points of view, were able to predict the downfall.<br /><br />The example of the Fat Tony, is just wrong, even by his logic. Nassim states of this Fat Tony who has cash and luck. But where are the other Fat Tony's who do not have neither of those. Instead, someone who graduated top in his class in college, has a lot more probability of having a good life and a secure job. (Last time I checked, tenured professor was one of the best paid and secure jobs in the world).

I have been a huge fan of fantasy literature, especially Dragonlance, Darksun, Forgotten Realms, and Stephen King's books, and I'm just amazed with this. Expect the unpredictable. Be shocked. Very shocked. This is not just some magic and dragons. This is tough material. (Keep away from kids!)  Honestly, if you haven't read them yet, do it now. And by the way, don't miss the HBO series either, it is a great (and I really mean GREAT) adaptation of the first book.
B004I4NRMC|5.0|I am always looking for new music. Searching for that treasured prize that will cause me to admire it more as time passes.  I really enjoy listening to this.  The structure, vocals, timing and chord structure is fascinating.  Periodic reminders of the first side are found on side b.  The whole album is easy to listen to, but it defiantly builds and treats your devoted attention.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|this movie is epic! you just have to watch it! the dvd and casing is also well made and high quality
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I honestly loved this book. I just could not put it down, it was a page turner and I loved the relationship between all of the characters. Very well done Jamie McGuire!
B000069HZP|5.0|Highly recommend! The movie came in perfect condition! I was worried that it would be defective because I had purchased it for such a great price. But when it came in, it was in it's original case, enclosed and wrapped in a plastic seal, and was obviously untouched! I was so happy when it came in! Shipping time was great as well. I am very satisfied with the seller!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|I cannot recommend this enough.  It simplifies file organization with powerful features that make having a rooted phone worthwhile.    That said, I can also recommend this to users who have not taken the root plunge, as a phenomenal file explorer.  A steal for only $1
0553801473|3.0|Have been waiting for this book for ages and gulped it down in 2 days. Reeling from the experience.<br /><br />*As someone cleverlypointed out, i haven't discussed anything about the book, the plot or the character, here is my edited review:<br /><br />After skipping entire chapters concerning Brienne Tarth in thr fourth book, I was glad to 'see' some of my beloved characters again. The author seems to be casting his net wider and wider and there are several different conclusions that this saga might come to. I fear seven books won't be enough unless he skips years. This, however doesn't seem to concern him as he seems to bide his time in moving the story along. I understand this is necessary as the characters need tome to grow and learn but it makes the wait and the hype not worth it.<br /><br />Wait for the rest before starting the saga, they are addictive!
B000002WPI|5.0|One of the top albums in hip-hop history, a true classic. I don't know what more needs to be said. Wu-Tang brought an entirely new flavor to rap music and influenced the generation of rappers and producers that followed. 'Enter the Wu-Tang' was like a B-12 shot into the flagging world of rap in the early '90s. Many of the icons of hip-hop, from Jay-Z to the Notorious B.I.G. to Nas and so on can trace their lineage to the originality and genius of this very album.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Amelie in blu-ray is eye-candy. It is absolutely a visual feast and a delight to experience. There is so much to applause: The timing, editing, art direction/production, direction, storyline and the performances are all wonderful, too! This will always be a favorite in my growing blu-ray collection.
1401307450|1.0|As with Keith Richards and \\"Life\\", this book merely shows someone living their life as an unbelievably self-centred, selfish f%ing ahole, applying radically different standards to themselves than they apply to others.  Do you have to be an a%hole to be a rock star?
0802473156|4.0|This has challenged both my wife and I to think through how we view each other's strategies in love. Gary is a master in these areas of thought! He ranks high in my opinion.    I am a Bible teacher, and have been an expositor of scripture for many years. I did miss direct references to how these languages relate to the love of God expressed in Christ. I have not read all of Gary's works. Perhaps he addresses this aspect in other books.    I am very appreciative of his work.
B0035V35P8|5.0|I love this movie. Its a nice break from the 'normal' movie were there is always a couple falling in love. the action was great, not really horror and gore though as the blood and guts were obviously fake. But i still love the concept of the movie.
6305718954|5.0|The Catholic Church attempted to ignore this movie in hopes that it would go away with no fanfare.  Sadly for them, this movie is REALLY GOOD!  The cast seem as though they were born to play these roles.  The director does a great job of telling a compelling story.  After seeing both endings, I have answered the lingering question I had after the first time I saw the movie.    Watching Frankie's story, you may find yourself seeking more information and rather than pulling away from God and Church (as the church feared).

B000R8YC18|5.0|Any film by Paul schrader is ok with me.  I love his work.  This film gives me chills even to think about it. I have the soundstrack and can see the film in my head as i listen to it.  I also bought the book. \\"The making of Taxi Driver.\\"  It is  amazing.  I saw this film in the theaters  when i was 16 in high school.  I am not sure if back then i totally understood it.  It took a few viewings as I got older.

B004Q8FTE4|4.0|This is just what I needed.I got a bunch of replacements for my wore out one's.The only thing I don't like is the sleeves could have been better,like easier to take out & put back in(they will get scrathed over time)so I just used softer sleeves.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was an enjoyable summer read. Unlikely plot, but good fun for escapist entertainment. The author's style is predictable, but that's part of the fun. I love discovering the work of an author and following from one book to the next.

B000J103WK|5.0|I was skeptical about getting this at first but I have no regrets.  You'll forget that this is regular DVD format.  When playing this media on my PS3 with an Onkyo 5.1 receiver and Sony 240 hz Bravia, I am quite pleased with this video.     All the favorites are included and in pristine quality.  Five stars.  This rivals some of my blu-ray concerts.  It's that good.
B004G5ZXVQ|1.0|R.E.M. have a long and storied career with many and varied fine albums. This is not one of them.     My overall impression after multiple listens and active and passive effort to enjoy it is of two of them putting the grinding sounds together and the third guy singing a different song with indifferent lyrics over the loud ruckus. Men my age making a lot of noise and not much sense. The main effect this music had on me was to exacerbate my tinnitus.     \\"Now\\" may be the sound they've collapsed into, but the R.E.M. that is interesting is the one that rises to their own creativity. If this is what they have to offer, it may be time to call it a day.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I love Lady Gaga's new album Born This Way all of her new songs are awesome! She's the new queen of pop. It's fun to dance to also. Lady Gaga changed pop music forever. I think the recycled manufactured pop junk fad is out of style now. hehe... Most of Lady Gaga's songs are about being meaningful (which is pretty cool).     1) Marry The Night 10/10  2) Born This Way 10/10  3) Government Hooker 10/10  4) Judas 10/10  5) Americano 10/10  6) Hair 10/10  7) ScheiBe 10/10  8) Bloody Mary 10/10  9) Black Jesus + Amen Fashion 10/10  10) Bad Kids 10/10  11) Fashion of His Love 10/10  12) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) 10/10  13) Heavy Metal Lover 10/10  14) Electric Chapel 10/10  15) The Queen 10/10  16) You & I 10/10  17) The Edge of Glory 10/10  Disc 2:  Born This Way (Country Road Version) 10/10  Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix) 10/10  Marry the Night (Zedd Remix) 10/10  ScheiBe (DJ White Shadow Mugler) 10/10  Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix) 10/10  Born This Way is the best album in 2011.

B003N7GATM|4.0|I can easily pick up on Reznor'sinfluence on a number of the tracks.  The somber, female voice along with the synthesizers make for some relaxing tunes.  Its somewhat reminiscent of 8mm's style.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The blu-ray is no less than stunning..A mix of 1.78-1 and 2.35-1..IMAX seamlessly inter mixed throughout..The video is flawless..The HD lossless audio is used often and to great effect..    Even if you do not like Batman or the story..This is so much more..With The joker character Nolan went all the way. He made it more about Evil than a silly \\"Joker\\". He made a point that the Joker is the antithesis of Batman---Chaos. You could almost see the \\"do what thou wilt\\" oozing off the Joker..This is a Dark film and a great action film.    The blu-ray is the best i've ever scene..PERIOD..    Heck..it's worth the price just for the opening scene..    Get it..buy it..watch it..over and over..

B005DD7H50|2.0|it pretty much sucked. the only evidence we have of his \\"limitless thought\\" is fighting and saying random stuff about the stock market.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|The first time I saw \\"The American\\" I missed the first 20 minutes and the rest seemed a disconnected mess. The second time I saw the whole thing and asked myself, \\"Is something going on here?\\" Well, yes, but not much.<br /><br />Director Aaron Corbijn's effort to make a Charles Bronson-type crime drama with George Clooney in the lead goes awry almost from the beginning. Instead of successfully hawking Bronson's typical intense, aloof and cold-blooded loner, Clooney is awash in a Johnny one note straight-faced mug with more paranoia than Gene Hackman demonstrated in [[ASIN:B003O7I6SE The Conversation]]. Instead of a confident hit man that knows what he's doing, he's more the schizophrenic lottery winner that didn't pay the taxes and then sees the IRS around every corner.<br /><br />This is a story about George Clooney as an Ameican hit man in Europe. He departs Sweden when he learns he is the next target and meanders to Italy. In one of crime drama's most enduring cliches, he agrees to one last hit that you know will be his undoing. Instead of being the hitter, he provides the weaponry. He acquires a girlfriend and has movie foreplay with the similarly gorgeous killer-to-be, a beauty with her clothes on (unlike his girlfriend in half her scenes,) and he develops a relationship with a priest. A theme grows around Clooney's inability to relate, the killing of a bunch of Italian prostitutes (that's where he meets his girlfriend), foreplay with the other killer, and Clooney's eventual route out of this life that gets played out at an Italian stream.<br /><br />Throw in a duplicitous front man and you have the makings of a confusing, go nowhere crime drama that is fully realized by inadequate acting and a startling lack of direction. It's a nice travelouge small town Italy and its countryside, with a few snowy scenes in Sweden, but otherwise this is a needlessly predicatble film. I figured out the denouement about 5 minutes into this movie and I wasn't wrong (almost said I wasn't disappointed but I was.) The thematic material led me there, as did the lack of direction. It's been done to death in good and bad crime dramas over the years; if you saw Victor Mature meet his fate in 1947's [[ASIN:B000B83846 Kiss of Death]], you know what to expect here.<br /><br />Comparing this to other bad crime dramas I know, it has commonalities with Richard Gere's [[ASIN:0792844807 Breathless]], the 1983 remake of the French film [[ASIN:B00005NC66 A Bout de Souffle]] about an American girl and a French criminal in Paris. The remake had a French girl and an American criminal in Los Angeles. \\"The American\\" had an American and a Europen girl in Italy. One of the three had direction. After seeing Gere's remake in the theater, my friend summed it up in one sentence: \\"A movie about Richard Gere trying to get a check.\\" What's most disappointing is \\"The American\\" isn't even trying to achieve that.t I was.)

B0050LJIRK|3.0|I was a huge Limp Bizkit fan when they were at the peak of their hype in '99-'00.  Unfortunately, this album has evolved well beyond the sound that I was accustomed to.  It's more rap-like and the beats aren't nearly as catchy as the ones in former albums.
B000O599ZS|5.0|It is nice to see, as in the other reviews, a great movie is still appreciated so many years after its initial release. Even new generations admire great movie making and \\"The Searchers\\" certainly stands among the best. I can't really add anything to the marvelous reviews here. I've watched this movie I don't know how many times and will see it again and again especially now that it's on blu-ray. The color and cinematography are splendid and the sharpness of blu-ray almost makes one feel that he is there as you can almost count every rock in Monument Valley. One reviewer complained that the actor chosen to play \\"Scar\\" did not look like any of the other Indians because he was a German born actor. Eh, So what? I think that they wanted some one who would stand out among the others and not look so blended in yet still look the part which I think he pulled it off rather well. In \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" Horst Buckholst was chosen to play a Mexican born gunfighter who (I think)he was German born as well(someone correct me if I am wrong, please), yet he managed to pull it off quite well, thank you. The blu-ray edition of \\"The Searchers\\" is wonderful and a proud edition to my library and its a great way to show-off my HD-TV. Now I'm waiting, with equal enthusiasm, for another beautifully photographed John Wayne-John Ford western epic \\"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon\\" to show up on blu-ray.
0307477479|5.0|This book is a great look at the world we live in today. It is at turns funny, heartbreaking and life affirming.  I haven't read a work of fiction that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed this one in many years.  Highly recommended.
B00479SVBU|4.0|The transmitter works well with the IPOD Classic which is why we purchased it.  We use it in an older car without an auxiliary port and a boat. The sound quality is very good and it is nice that you can charge the IPOD with it via the USB port.  The remote is fairly useless if you are hooking up an Ipod, so don't buy it for that.  I think that viewing the songs over the transmitter screen and the remote must only work with SD cards and not Ipods. We haven't tried other features because basically we were looking for a good transmitter and that is what we got.  The other thing that is nice is that the transmitter is small, but large enough so that the controls are not awkward and the screen is easy to view.
1451629184|5.0|My heart breaks for this young girl who was robbed of her innocence.  Jaycee proved to be stronger than I would be and stronger than the people who held her captive.  They didn't rob her of her love for her family and friends.  I believe it is that love that got her through 18 years of captivity.     This book is written from the heart and it will grab your emotions.       I have immeasurable respect for Jaycee Lee Dugard.  I pray that the rest of her life will be happy and free.
1597801585|2.0|Overall: Disappointing that this should have won the Hugo/Nebula. For a number of reasons.    THE GOOD    Bacigalupi's worldbuilding is great: he imagines a far future Kingdom of Thailand, where risen sea levels + GMO mayhem have managed to destroy the planet. This biopunk dystopia feels desperate, immediate and urgent, and, on a macro scale, it's a scathing commentary on (fair) trade, ag subsidies in the US/Europe, the American food industry and people (such as myself) burning up the atmo in environmentally-unsound jet planes. In Bacigalupi's future history, we arrogant, over-happy, over-traveled 21st century citizens are living during the brief \\"Expansion\\" era - soon to be followed by a violent and unpleasant \\"Contraction\\" where no one will travel any further than where their feet can carry them. Bacigalupi's future Thailand is just after the Contraction, now poised on the edge of a possible second \\"Expansion\\", using resurrected woolly mammoth (OK, megodonts - but wtf is a megodont) strength and methane composting to fuel industry.    THE BAD    Bacigalupi may be an inventive worldbuilder, but he is not an inventive writer - nor even a particularly good one. He violates the sacrosanct Law of Good (or at least Decent) Writing, which is \\"show us, don't tell us\\" - often bluntly introducing characters as \\"terrifying\\" or \\"charming\\". Um, why not save some word count and just say, \\"The villain entered.\\" Another tiresome authorial tic was repetition: if I saw Emiko the Cyborg Lady described one more time as exhibiting \\"telltale stutter-stop herky-jerky\\" movements or a character described by their (often \\"pale\\" or \\"icy\\" or \\"watery\\" blue) eyes... oh my God. Oh. My. God.    THE UGLY    This was the dealbreaker. I forced myself to finish this book, as I have a spiritual obligation to all Hugo/Nebula joint winners, but wtf is up with this thinly-veiled retrograde Orientalist male chauvinist fantasy? To whit: Chapter 1 introduces Anderson Lake, the blond/blue-eyed American malehero who will guide us through this exotic (EXOTIC) foreign land of small, shy, deferential, and pitiably incompetent Asians. Chapter 2 introduces Anderson's Chinese sidekick, Hock Seng, a survivor of an Islamic fundamentalist genocide against ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. Hock Seng is embittered, often described as scheming or cowering or untrustworthy, and he spends the entire book lamenting his victim state and attempting (but always failing) to make a better life for himself. Just in case it's not clear: Hock Seng has no agency. Chapter 3 introduces the titular \\"windup girl\\", Emiko, a Japanese sex slave robot woman who is repeatedly raped (described in - DARE I SAY IT - loving (!?) detail), works in a stereotypical Miss Saigon-style brothel, and dreams of a better future where New People (i.e. windups) live free and unmolested. She has also been programmed to serve (one geneticist character speculating she has Labrador DNA in her!) and is repeatedly described as a \\"dog\\".     Unsurprisingly, when Anderson isn't planning to overthrow this \\"little country\\" in order to make room for American profiteering GMO interests (from the Midwest! the Heartland!), he falls hard in love with the poor, bruised, whimpering, helpless Emiko. Various scenes of rescue and damsel-in-distress ensue.    OK, I'm assuming Bacigalupi has never been exposed to post-colonialism/Orientalism/feminism, because this entire premise just reeks of unreconstructed American/white/male hegemonic views. Not only is it alarming and disappointing that this type of story still has any sort of currency at all (but then, alas, my beloved scifi genre is one of the most unreconstructed in this regard...), but it's also incredibly tedious, unnecessary and unrealistic. I'm a scifi writer and fan, and a lady, and all I can hope for is to read about other future-ladies being... victims, objectified and sexualized? (Even Mai, Hock Seng's sidekick, is a little girl who does little more than cry out in alarm as plottwists promise ruin.) The only woman who enjoys any sort of agency in this story is Kanya, a Ministry of Environment official who is described as an unsmiling hardass (also, wait for it, a victim! her village was destroyed by evil men!) and, surprise, a lesbian.    Bacigalupi excuses himself from any potential attacks re: his portrayal of the Other by noting that this is THE FUTURE and thus not really Thailand at all. He then recommends a number of ethnically Thai authors. Um, I have no problem with writers of one ethnicity writing about other ethnicities, as long as they're respectful and informed and not idiotically exoticizing about it. I even don't have too much of a problem of white/male authors writing about non-white/non-male issues - fraught as that may seem, given the world we live in - because I'm sure it can be done well. What I CANNOT STAND are lazy narratives of romanticized victimization and macho Orientalist fantasies. And for that, I hated this book and am disappointed that it was so lauded by the arbiters of good sf.
030788743X|5.0|It's 2044,and 18 year old Wade Watts lives in \\"the stacks\\",which consists of layer upon layer of trailer homes (some reaching 20 high). Steeped in poverty,his only escape is OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation),a virtual world where he can attend school,never get beat up,and has every book,song,or piece of art he could ever imagine at his fingertips. The Great Recession is entering its third decade,and finding a job to help pay for his OASIS travels is pretty much out of the question. Fast food joints have 2 year waiting lists,fossil fuels are dwindling,and the human race is using OASIS more and more to escape from a world that is collapsing all around them.<br /><br />When the creater of OASIS,the eccentric,80's obsessed James Halliday,passes away,he leaves a legacy behind:hundreds of billions of dollars,there for the taking for anyone that can find a series of keys and gates within OASIS,and find the Easter Egg at the end. Millions have tried and failed,and years go by with no progress,the game becoming somewhat of a legend,something never to be solved,until Wade finds the Copper Key. When Wade's crush,a female blogger named Art3mis,also finds the Copper Key,the race is on,like,well,Donkey Kong (sorry,couldn't help it.)<br /><br />Wade instantly becomes a celebrity,and others soon begin nipping at his heels,including IOI,a huge conglomerate bent on taking over OASIS and making it their own money making playground,using any means possible,and I do mean any. True gunters (OASIS freaks),are determined not to let this happen,but with vast resources at IOI's disposal,they are a real threat,and when they make Wade an \\"offer he just can't refuse\\",his virtual,and real life may be at stake.<br /><br />Told from Wade's point of view,we get a glimpse into a future where a virtual world holds more sway than reality,and human reaction is played out inside an 80's drenched world where old school video games are the norm,and every tiny detail has meaning. Wade has spent nearly his entire existence memorizing facts from Halliday's manifesto,Anorak's Almanac,watching hours and hours of 80's sitcoms,listening to 80's music,and soaking up anything else that Halliday has deemed important. Ready Player One is kind of like \\"It's a Mad,Mad,Mad World\\" on steroids,and of course,involving millions of players instead of a handful. Yes,Wade's best friend and crush are avatars,but what is that when you have an endless world at your fingertips,and you can be anything,and anyone,that you want?<br /><br />One the surface,Ready Player One is a geekfest of the highest order. Children of the 80's,like me,will thrill at the shear amount of nostalgia that packs these pages,and also at the absolutely wondrous virtual world that the author has created for his characters. The references are a blast,my favorites being a challenge that involves acting out the movie WarGames and a sequence involving a key scene from Blade Runner. Underneath the skin,however,is a story about an insecure,lonely teen that has been raised by a reality that just isn't real,and who finds out that you really should be careful what you wish for. There's a heartbreaking love story here too,and some lovely nuance underneath the geek. Ernest Cline's writing is intricate,sharp and witty,and he delivers a story with plenty of action that will not only excite you with its race to the finish,but also make you think about what it means to be human. The power of friendship and love (even if it's in virtual reality),and sheer determination are strong themes here,and as you move toward the ending,everything will click together perfectly like Tetris blocks,leaving you pleasantly exhausted and wondering where the time went.

B002VECM6S|1.0|Before this, I had no idea who Michael Oher was, but throughout the film, the absurd script hinted strongly that some serious LIES were being told.  Turns out I was right.  The Blind Side took the true, inspirational story of a talented, incredibly determined, intelligent and focused young man and turned it into a sick fantasy of a white family taking in Magilla Gorilla and teaching him to block'um people and read'um English.       Bad, racist perspectives are not new in Hollywood.  What is scary is that those involved made a conscious decision to portray this man as a mentally-challenged animal.  What, they didn't have Oher's phone number to ask if this story was accurate?  We know from Oher's own book that the depiction was offensive to him.  We know from other true accounts that Oher was helped by many people, but first and foremost, by himself.  It was Oher's personal qualities that roused people to help him down the road he was determined to travel; not the help of others that made him want to be something.    More frightening is how thrilled the public was to see this film.  The movie missed not one racist trick, including throwing in that he was violent!  The trash about his testing high for \\"protective instincts\\" (sounds like an American Kennel Club description of a pitbull, not a human) went down like chicken soup with white audiences.

B002N8A14M|3.0|I love the protective case for the iPod. The jack for my headphones (which are not the standard iPod headphones) fits, but just barely so I can see how that would be an issue for other users. The armband is where I'm slightly disappointed. I supposed I have wimpy arms! In order to get the band tight enough so that it does not slide, I have to draw the elastic very tight... there's no velcro left to secure the band to. So I wear it as loosely as possible, but it does still slide. Also, one of the seams on the band does irritate my skin as I run and winds up leaving a red, irritated area on my arm. So, thumbs up for the clear case. Thumbs down for the armband.

She will live forever in her music, and the hearts  of her fans.
0307346617|5.0|The first I heard of this book was oddly enough when Brad Pitt got signed to the movie, oh must be a year or so ago. Normally I don't pay attention to 'yet another zombie movie,' but Pitt, regardless of what people think of his acting talent, does not jump into frivolous projects. So, based on that I sought out the book, only to find I could not get it in the bookstores in Australia. I managed to read up on the author, Max Brooks, and caught the You Tube versions of this book and Brooks' other works, and found myself intrigued enough to finally get on Amazon and buy it.    I am glad to say I am happy to have bought this book on the Zombie War. I read through the book in a day and plan to re-read it at work during my breaks. I really liked the positive message of the book: that despite all our prejudices as a race we can come together, and not be doomed to die, or be undead. This is a book I can recommend, and I look forward to seeing the movie.

0517548232|5.0|I've toyed with the idea of buying this book for some time.  My minor as a PhD student was economics, so I have all the quant-heavy micro, macro, and econometrics.  Comparative statics, production functions and all that fun stuff (Chiang, Varian, Judge, Theil, etc.,etc.).  I thought this book might be really trivial, but it's not.  This book has absolutely none of the quantitative stuff, but it is very heavy on reasoning through economic relationships and effects.    This book takes a theme from Frederic Bastiat (that which is seen and that which is unseen) and develops and illustrates it.  Basically, Hazlett goes through economic policy arguments and illustrates not only the seen (favorable) effects, but lays out all of the \\"unseen\\" negative effects.  Based solely on an understanding of supply and demand, the fact that resources are scarce, and that people will act to maximize their own welfare, Hazlitt shows how horribly misguided and counterproductive many economic policies are.  Although originally written back in 1946 (with lots of references to New Deal programs) it is just as relevant to todays economic policy proposals and arguments.    I really can't recommend this book highly enough.  It's fun and refreshing for people with an academic background in economics, and at the same time extremely accessible for those who don't.  I'm going to see if I can get a bulk deal on a couple of cases to pass out to my students for free.    Another reviewer criticized it as partisan or as a \\"libertarian manifesto\\".  No reviewer has actually mentioned an ERROR in it; some people simply don't like the conclusions it draws.  The problem is that it's awfully difficult to refute the conclusions.      Hazlitt was apparently a real gentleman, and although other reviewers may try to politicize the book its tone hasn't a hint of partisanship.

It is the rare work that will have you not only laughing out loud, but grabbing your friends to have them read what you just read, yourself, to share in the hilarity immediately.

B0055D3EOG|4.0|The story doesn't make much sense - something about a boy who gets lost after leaving his physical body and floating off into another dimension.  Scribbled on the wall of his bedroom is a note:  \\"Last night I watched myself sleep, then I flew away.\\"     Now an empty vessel, the child's body attracts hordes of malevolent spirits who fight to possess it.  Despite the New Age twaddle about astral projection, this movie delivers on the chills.  I don't scare easily and I don't particularly care for ghost stories, but I couldn't resist renting \\"Insidious\\" after reading the reviews.  I expected to laugh but laugh I did not.  I admit to six good scares (goose bumps and all), beginning quickly in the opening credits right on through to the gotcha ending.  That's a personal record.  I'll never think about Tiny Tim's \\"Tiptoe Through The Tulips\\" in quite the same way again.  If you like ghost stories, then consider viewing \\"Insidious\\" in the dead of night in a creepy old house.  Enjoy the ride and pay no attention to the old hag in the window.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time   by Mark Haddon  Review by Sara Cho        Starting from the long and extensive title, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, all the way to the last page of the appendix, \\"typical\\" isn't the right adjective to describe Mark Haddon's emotionally thrilling novel.  It is hard to say which genre the novel falls into because it seems to be an unusual mix of detective fiction and autobiography.  In his heartwarming and insightful novel, Haddon explores the life and mind of a 15-year-old boy and propels the reader into a rarely observed world.      The entire novel is actually written in the viewpoint of Christopher Boone, the autistic protagonist and narrator of the story.  The story begins with Christopher discovering Wellington, a poodle, dead on a yard: \\"It was 7 minutes after midnight.  The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shear's house.  Its eyes were closed.  It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream.  But the dog was not running or asleep.  The dog was dead.  There was a garden fork sticking out the dog.\\"  He soon decides to investigate and find out who had killed Wellington, and for this reason, Christopher claims that his story is a murder mystery novel.  Although the novel eventually reveals the secret of Wellington's murder, a much bigger and more complicated mystery in Christopher's life is exposed to the audience later on in the story.      Although Christopher never mentions the word \\"autism\\" anywhere in his story, he shows several symptoms of the disorder.  Christopher is confused by metaphors, often digresses from his main point unintentionally, goes off into random unnecessary tangents, tries to set exact rules and definitions for abstract things, and doesn't know or understand other people's emotions and thoughts.  It seems that even he himself cannot have emotions.  However, Christopheris brilliant at math.  He bases his whole life around logic and is unable to comprehend illogical actions and motives. He explains and solves complicated math problems to the readers and memorizes details quickly and easily. Therefore, he numbers all the chapters in the book using prime numbers, which he has memorized.      In a way, Christopher's literal, straightforward approach to life feeds our desire to know more about Christopher personally.  Christopher's unemotional and unbiased recounting of all the details in his adventure enhances the story and allows the readers to express more of their own feelings and fill in the emotional blanks themselves.  As Christopher adds layers of precise detail to his narrative, readers see through Christopher's own puzzled eyes and often become frustrated at his limits of understanding and sympathize towards his painfully honest reports of his actions.      Haddon takes the extraordinary, daring leap into a new world of writing and lands beautifully.  For the most part, Christopher should be a very unappealing character for most readers with his behavioural difficulties and his inability to understand and experience emotions such as anger and love.  However, without cushioning the protagonist with unrealistic sentimentality, Haddon gives Christopher the dignity of an honest voice and guides the reader to empathize with him.  Readers will enjoy reading The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and will experience and discover emotions they have never felt before.

0312600844|5.0|Don't be misled by all the one-star reviews.  This is an immensely readable book with a thought-provoking theme: \\"Freedom\\".  What happens when freedom becomes itself the ultimate end, when the quest to satisify individual desire becomes the highest good in life?    The reaction of those who have panned this novel on political grounds (often for the thinly veiled reason that it's not \\"believable\\") is based on a complete misreading. Franzen is most emphatically not writing from some narrow-minded leftist ideology, in spite of his jaundiced view of corporate greed and the Iraq war.  What he's really writing about is the consequences of leading a life where the insatiable pursuit of freedom to do anything, a life of \\"sex, drugs, and rock n roll\\", to use a phrase popularized in the 60s, is the highest good.  In one of the more memorable phrases of the novel, he's writing about people who have total freedom to f*** themselves up.  His take on our American worship of individual freedom may frighten and disturb some readers.  Heck, I found this novel very disturbing myself at times.  It is certainly not politically correct.  But this take on what might be termed \\"freedomolatry\\" is the most brilliant thing about it.    The central characters, Patty, Walter, and Richard are three-dimensional characters and highly believable.  They are neither good nor evil; they are flawed human beings.  As in The Corrections, Franzen is giving us characters who are trying with varying degrees of success to maintain some degree of personal integrity in spite of being caught up in a system where the incentives seem to penalize it.  When Walter achieves success it is for the wrong reasons, according to his own lights.  When Richard achieves success it's also for the wrong reasons according to his own lights.  Patty's confession, \\"Mistakes Were Made\\", chronicles her descent from the ultimate \\"team player\\" into a hellish miasma of egomania, unsatisfied sexual longing, and confusion of values.The other characters, although not as fully developed, are also well-drawn and amplify this theme.  Walter's son Joey carries adolescent rebellion to its logical extreme, but freedom from parental constraints does not turn out for him the way he intended.  Connie, his girlfriend, is a contrast to all this.  She is a study in self-abnegation and achieves a kind of purity and personal integrity in spite of her sexual abandon.  Abigail, Patty's \\"brilliant\\" sister is not a \\"hippie\\" as at least one reviewer seemed to think.  She is the over-indulged daughter of wealthy parents who has been encouraged to do exactly as she likes because she is so \\"talented\\". The result is the story of a pathetically narrow, selfish, and wasted life.    The reviewers who have complained that there is no plot to this novel must have been reading a different book from the one I read.  The book is broken into sections; each section is given over to the point of view of a major character.  As the book progresses the chronology advances.  This is not an technique that is unusual or difficult to comprehend.  We follow the progress of the characters from their college years (actually from their childhood in flashback mode) thru mid-life and a bit beyond.  If you're looking for a murder mystery or an action-packed thriller this is not the book for you.  If you're looking for a book that chronicles ordinary events in the lives of ordinary people, such as growing up, facing disappointments in youth, marrying, raising children who then leave home either with or without your blessing, separating, and so on, then you'll find more than enough to keep the narrative flow going.    My only complaint about Freedom is that I found it somewhat depressing, particularly towards the middle.  I was finding it hard to put down, but about halfway through I actually stopped reading it for a few days because I needed to get away from it.  Actually this is high praise for the reality of the characters and situations.I came back to it and I'm glad I did; towards the end there is a redemptive glimmer.

1400032717|3.0|The book, Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, written by Mark Haddon, is different from most books that I have read before. Christopher Boone, the main character who is fifteen years old, sets out to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog, Wellington. Although that's not the only thing, after discovering Wellington's murderer, Christopher leaves his home in Swindon England, to find out if his mother is alive or not in London, England. One more thing, Christopher has a form of Autism or Asperger's Syndrome. It's not mentioned in the book what Christopher is specifically diagnosed with because Haddon himself says he is no expert on Autism or Asperger's. The reason why Autism seems to be the answer to Christopher's condition is because he doesn't communicate well with people. In fact, it seems as if Christopher prefers animals over people. For example, Christopher has a pet rat, Toby, which he loves and cares for very well. Also, on the night of Wellington's murder, Christopher held the dog in his arms. Christopher normally does not like to be touched by people but he is willing to hold a dead and bloody dog. Christopher doesn't even like hugs. When he \\"hugs\\" his parents, they spread their hands and touch each other's fingertips.<br /> I believe The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime fits in the mystery novel genre. The book categorizes well in this genre because Christopher tries to find out who killed Wellington. Finding out Wellington's murderder might be shocking for some readers, but throughout the middle of the book, I knew who the killer was. The book not only focuses on Wellington's mystery but also it has a sense of adventure. The adventure in the book isn't super exciting, but still somewhat exciting. Christopher runs away from his home to find his mother. He nearly spends half a day trying to get through a train station to go to London, England. Christopher is even faced with a small cop chase in the train station and and endsup escaping the cop.<br /> The book's writing style is different from some books I've read. It's the point of view from an (I assume) Autistic teenage boy. Yes, every person thinks differently, but I guess I'll say Christopher is even more different. For example, throughout the book, Christopher likes to digress. He goes off trying to figure out things and/or explaining things. A great example is when Christopher goes into detail about explaining the Monty Hall problem.<br />Personally, the book was not what I had expected at all. After reading the title, I thought the book was focused more on the what happened to the dog and be and adventure novel. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that it was not what I expected. Also, I think what makes me dislike the novel is because the novel is told from Christopher's perspective. Because Christopher is a logical thinker, it seems as if the book was just written with facts that droned on and on.
B00479SVBU|4.0|It plays the songs well. Only think I don't like is, it does not remember the song/position it played last before it was switched off. So every time we have to select the song. To circumvent that, I have put this player in random play mode, in this mode it does remember the last song and we are good with that. The FM transmitter is very good. And I like the 4 FM memory.
B000683VI4|5.0|When I first watched this movie I cried so hard because I could relate to Allie.  She had her TRUE love but was being forced by her mother to marry someone else.  You should never compromise your heart and you should never make trade offs.  If you truly LOVE someone, you should tell him/her and be determined to follow through from that point on.  No one has the right to tell you who YOU should love OR marry for that fact.  I loved James Gardner because he shows how much she meant to him by admitting himself into the senior facility and always being there to help her.  And the end, they both die together.  Label me a romantic but I think we all fantasize about romance some point in life.  Who doesn't!!  I keep this movie in my DVD library and watch it when I want to cry.  This was an excellent movie and I would recommend you buy it.  Thanks for reading and Much happines and joy, Anna R. Wells [[ASIN:B00004WI5F Where the Heart Is]]

B003V4AK8E|1.0|The kids were excited to get this new controller but after a short period of time it was relegated to the bottom drawer and they were back to using our standard ones.    Some of the things they didn't like about it:  For some reason this controller always defaults to first player. So even if other controllers are turned on first, this one takes that slot.  You can't turn on the system with it.  The controls aren't accurate.   And most importantly, it tends to go off after short periods of time if it is not plugged in with the wire.

It had me laughing out loud!!! Esp the carnival scenes...  LOL!!!  and those little monkeyS!!!  it was just all-around funny!!!      3Dness, very nice!!!  not many things JUMPED out at you and in a few places, I thought I saw some ghosting... but, other than that, the colors were brillant!!! and the places where things jumped out at you, they REALLY did!!!

Glad to lump them in to the same category as a bunch of crap bands without talent, based largely on nothing at all.    Last week I heard a song on The Fraction and was blown away.  I whipped out Shazam and was stunned to see Avenged Sevenfold as the artist.  A band I had assumed, for no reason, was utter crapped was suddenly evoking memories of late 80's Megadeath, Metallica and GNR all while brining in their own style.  WTF?    I've been listening to Nightmare all week and can't stop.  I want to start hitting the back catalog, but am still so taken by this one album.    Always nice to be reminded not to too quickly judge something/someone without really giving it/them a shot.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I treasured the book, it is on my ever growing list of best books I have read. It is not just about race but also about not fitting in and people treating you bad because they have no other way to be. The movie captured this perfectly ,I was worried it wouldn't.  I cringed when I saw the trailor, it looked like one of those boring romantic comedies that I detest. Esp, when I saw Bryce Dallas Howard playing Hilly Holbrook. Bryce kind of looks like how I pictured Mrs. Leefolt.  Luckilly, the trailor  is misleading and the movie for the most part gets it right. Bryce plays Hilly eerilly well,without veering too far into cartoon land. I liked sissy spacek as Hilly's mother. They gave a little more history on why hilly is such a rotten little priss. They also got rid of the story of why constantine left and replaced it with something that just made more sense. I thought they should have put less about the pie and the bathroom and more of Miss Celia and Minny and some of the lesser characters like Luanne and her maid and teenage grandson. You might wanna read the book before you go, or the ending might  not make sense. Alot of people stayed after and talked amongst themselves about what they thought of it. I live in a  multicultural neighbourhood and everybody agreed it was good, except for a few older club ladies that were incensed at how they were portrayed as  bubble headed ignoramuses.

Do these people realize that children nowadays are exposed to much worse than that, like words that start with F and S and songs or songs about clubs and drinking? Also, in early July, Monte Carlo, a movie that was NOT Disney, was started showing in theatres. HELLO! SHE WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THAT MOVIE!    Selena, your album was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

B005DI994W|3.0|While it has the expected jingoistic/nationalist tone for a British film made on the eve of WWII, it's actually a bit more cynical and somber than many such films made contemporaneously.  The focus is more on personal duty, honor, and friendship than \\"national service\\".<br /><br />While the plot is somewhat routine, there are moments that elevate it and the performances are good.  The battle sequences are good but (obviously) lose some impact on the small screen.  It may be apocryphal, but real British soldiers (in period outfits) and real dervishes were used as extras, and it is claimed that the British rifles were loaded in case the dervishes got \\"carried away\\" during filming.<br /><br />There is the usual casual racism of the era in the portrayal of any non-Europeans and the usual stilted dialogue of 30's films, but neither of these issues ruins the film.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed Lawrence of Arabia should find enough to appreciate in this film, although it obviously isn't anywhere in the same league.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|The SRK Cold steel knife is another great addition to there excellent product line and has been around quite awhile so it has past the test of time and being in use by Navy Seals doesn't hurt it's reputation either! This knife is a perfect size, not to big and not to small. Still small enough to comfortably field dress game and big enough to use for self protection. They come as advertised very, very sharp and in an excellent sheath. The tip, point seems to be especially strong and very sharp also. This knife is both a very good thrusting {stabbing} and slashing tool. All in all the SRK makes an excellent survival, hunting, camping and protection designed knife {tool}! You will not be sorry you purchased this knife but will wonder what took you so long to have one in your life! Stay sharp, Sean.
1416500294|5.0|Treasure Island, first published in book form in 1883, is THE pirate story. Many of the things we think of today as being trademarks of pirates (buried treasure, treasure maps, peg legs, parrots, desert islands) come more from Stevenson's tale than from history. But this book isn't about history, it's about pirates, adventure, and coming of age, and it delivers marvelously on all of those promises.<br /><br />The narrator, young Jim Hawkins, lives and works at an inn owned by his parents. One day, a mysterious seaman takes lodging there with an equally mysterious chest. After some time, other sailors arrive looking for the first seaman. Out of this, from the seaman's chest Jim manages to find a treasure map leading to the untold riches of a now-dead but still famous pirate named Captain Flint. Jim takes the map to a couple of country gentlemen, who decide to charter a ship to look for the treasure and take Jim along as cabin boy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Jim and our heroes, but fortunately for the plot, they have a hard time finding sailors, and they turn to their new ship's cook, the one-legged Long John Silver, for \\"help\\" in rounding out the crew. Silver, as is hardly a spoiler, is actually a former pirate and crews the ship accordingly, having heard what they're after and eager to find those riches for himself.<br /><br />The excitement mounts as Jim goes on several daring adventures to save himself and the faithful party, and Silver struggles to keep control of his mutineers, all the while treasure is calling. Jim shows a great deal of growth, taking charge of several perilous situations and demonstrating considerable bravery he never possessed when dealing with the mysterious sailor in his parents' inn. Silver, meanwhile, is a savvy character who's self-interest and ability to play both sides against the middle knows no bounds. If you're looking for a master of duplicity and double-cross, Silver could give Jack Sparrow lessons.<br /><br />Stevenson's writing is fantastic. The colorful language of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience. The drama steadily rises, despite the fact the book's story is well known and I've read it several times before. It's certainly no accident that this book has had such a powerful effect on an entire genre of fiction even 130 years later.<br /><br />I've also listened to the book as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to on several other stories. If you're considering which audio version to listen to, you can't go wrong with Cosham's.<br /><br />Treasure Island is about as easily available as a book can be, as every library will have it on hand, it's on Wikisource for free, Amazon has it for Kindle for free or in paperback for $2, and I've even seen it at Target for $1. It's also only 300 quick pages. Seriously, there is no excuse for not reading this book.guage of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience.
