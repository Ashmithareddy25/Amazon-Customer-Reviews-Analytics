B000PTYPAC|4.0|It is a difficult choice, but I would have to pick \\"Riot!\\" as the best of the first three albums from Paramore.  \\"All We Know\\" is a strong debut, but it has some weaker points, and \\"Brand New Eyes\\" has several of what I feel are their best songs, but it doesn't maintain such a high-level of quality on all of its tracks.  This is a very impressive album, all the more so when one considers that it is only their second.  It was released on June 12, 2007.    \\"For a Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic\\" opens the album with a strong number, but not one which would be released as a single.  As with most of the songs on this album it is fairly basic, but has a good driving feel to it.  \\"That's What You Get\\" is the next piece and is one of the four singles from the album.  This is followed by another single \\"Hallelujah\\" which is similar in lyric content, though this time instead of heading towards a break-up this one is about seeing things through and staying together.  \\"Misery Business\\" is another of the singles from the album, and another song about relationships, though this one is about fighting over a man.  \\"When it Rains\\" is another break-up song, but at least this one has a significantly different feel then those which came before.     \\"Let the Flames Begin\\" is the bridge song between the first and second half of the album.  This one isn't a relationship song, but instead seems to be about finding oneself.  \\"Miracle\\" moves back to the area of relationship pieces, and is probably the weakest song on the album, though that is not difficult given the quality of the rest of the tracks.  \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" is the next piece and the remaining single from the album.  This one rings in a different aspect to the other relationship songs on the album.  \\"We Are Broken\\" is next, and while one could put this in the category of relationship songs, it seems to be more about faith.  \\"Fences\\" also moves away from the relationship pieces as it is about dealing with living one's life in thepublic eye.  \\"Born for this\\" is a bit less obvious, but seems to be about struggling to make it.      If one wants to look for negatives, one can pick on \\"Miracle\\", the number of relationship songs, and perhaps a lack of diversity in sound, but when a group finds a sound that works for them it is perhaps too much to ask for them to abandon it.  This is only their second studio album, they still have time to stretch and grow as a group.  The positives far outweigh the negatives as this album is full of energy and lyrics that you want to sing-along with.  Paramore on this album was Hayley Williams (vocals), Josh Farro (guitars), Zac Farro (drums), Jeremy Davis (bass).  Hayley Williams and Josh Farro are the main songwriters, with one piece co-written with Zac Farro, one with future member Taylor York, and two with producer David Bendeth.

B001QOGYBI|2.0|This animated film, which features Armageddon between a fox who just cannot get thievery out of his system and three wealthy, but deranged, local farmers, gets points for its original style and a few good laughs, but no more.  In the end, it is just another relatively mindless action spectacle--a very sophisticated Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon.  Stack it up against a \\"Wall-E\\" or a \\"Secret of NIMH\\" and its fundamental hollowness becomes evident.  Unfortunate use of a very high-powered cast.
B001HBW30Q|4.0|Having recently purchased a blu-ray movie from Amazon.fr because it was unavailable in the U. S., I was delighted to discover the film would play on my blu-ray player.  There is no regional coding as with regular dvd's.  However, there were no subtitles and that appears to be the case with this title.  So, unless you are fluent with a foreign language film make sure  there are subtitles.      As for \\"The Dinner Game,\\" it is wickedly hilarious in much the same vein as \\"La Cage Aux Folles\\" and a number of other farces at which French cinema excels.  A region 1 version is available on regular dvd with the obligatory subtitles and you won't regret the investment in your time and money.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is an interesting modern version of   an old time favorite. The singing is great and I believe it will be an immediate Disney Classic! I really enjoyed the ending. It also teaches young people the value of sacrifice and the importance of giving of yourself.
B0009S4IKQ|5.0|Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />The lives of half a dozen people who normally wouldn't mix find themselves thrown into the melting pot of the truly grand Grand Hotel Berlin in this 30s era soap opera that's sort of like a cross between Peyton Place and Cabaret. In some ways it's a story of human desperation, the desperation that lurks just beneath the otherwise highly polished surface of this ritzy hotel. John Barrymore's character, although from baronial royalty, is broke and is desperately trying to steal the ballerina's jewels; Kringelein, the dying man played by Lionel Barrymore, is desperately trying to enjoy his last days in the glitzy company of Berlin's swankiest hotel. Greta Garbo is the high strung dancer desperate to be alone (\\"I vont to be alone!\\"), but also desperately wanting love, and Wallace Beery is an industrial tycoon desperately trying to swing a merger to save his failing company. There is certainly plenty of desperation to go around despite the otherwise festive facade of the Grand Hotel.<br /><br />The movie foreshadows the star-studded ensemble films of decades to come. An interesting piece of trivia is that despite the busy hotel lobby, the actors were made to wear socks over their shoes so as to cut down on the noise, wearing out 200 pairs of socks during the shooting of just the lobby scenes. Oddly enough, Grand Hotel is the only film to win best picture without receiving any other nominations. The great British actor, Robert Morley (The African Queen, etc.), once said he loved great hotels and wanted to die in the lobby of one. I hope he got his wish and I think he would have been very happy with Grand Hotel, even if he had to wear socks over his shoes. :-)
B0034JKZ86|4.0|Princess and the Frog is a refreshing return to old school Disney where the characters sing and are animated by hand. I also loved the bayou music, from Jazz to Zydeco and the underlying message that you can't just wish on a star, you have to work for your dreams to come true.

0061122092|5.0|I just finished reading this book, making it the 5th book by Coelho in the last three weeks that I've read and I have yet to be disappointed by his work. I am relatively new to Coelho and didn't realize how powerful and life changing his books can be. I decided to complete reading the Alchemist three weeks ago after picking it up for the first time two years ago, at which time I didn't have the patience to finish it being a student in college and also who's reading taste was quite different back then. I'm 24 now and decided to read it to find motivation after going through a somewhat rough and doubtful time in my life. I was inspired, motivated, and quite surprised by what the book did for me.. I decided to pick up other titles Coelho has written.    \\"By the River Piedra I sat down and wept\\" is the fifth title I've read, and I would say it ties \\"The Alchemist\\" for his best book so far, with \\"The Devil and Miss Prym\\" in second place. Unlike the Alchemist, which depicts the importance of believing in and pursing one's dreams no matter how doubtful or obscured it may seem, this book enlightens readers about the importance of love, faith, and forgiveness and solitude one lives with if love is not present is some way. It talks about taking risks for love, and that the fear of falling in love in order to avoid heartbreak and misery is never a good decision to not be in love. Love for another person, love for life, love for dreams, love for God. Without love, the possibility of happiness and meaning for life is highly unlikely.     I thought that the story being narrated from a young woman's point of view (Pilar) is brilliant. Being a 24 year old man, the book helped me further grasp the meaning of love, and also a deeper and empathetic understanding of a woman's struggle, triumphs, and perspective of life. Coelho's poetic story telling and his ability to depict various messages, ethics, morals, meaning of life and God with absolute clarity is one of a kind. I recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with relationships, or is looking for a deeper meaning and in the struggles that life makes you endure. It isn't a long read, but the amount of wisdom packed into the book is overwhelming.  \\"The Fifth Mountain\\" is the next Paulo Coelho book on my list to read, but I doubt it will have the same 'bang' this book and the Alchemist had. But as long as it is a book by Coelho, one can't go wrong.

B001JRB16U|5.0|100 years ago this spring, a magical young nanny named Mary Poppins(Julie Andrews) sat on a cloud, surveying London, and preparing to meet her next charges after receiving an advertisement they created, but which their father had destroyed.   Down below, in a pleasant suburb, her long-time friend, Bert (Dick Van Dyke), entertains patrons of a park with a one-man band-performance. Sensing the impending return of his friend, he introduces the unseen audience to the tempestuous Banks household, headed by George Banks, a banker(David Tomlinson), his suffragette wife, Winifred(Glynis Johns), with two boisterous children, Jane and Michael( Karen Doctrice and Matthew Garber), and frequently quarreling domestics(Reta Shaw and Hermione Baddeley). Across the street, the eccentric Admiral Boom(Reginald Owen) keeps things interesting.    An irate Katie Nanna(Elsa Lancaster), the children's current nanny, leaves after the children runaway for the umpteenth time, their latest excuse being that they were chasing a runaway kite. Mr. Banks likes order in his life, insisting that everything be in place, and his pipe and sherry be in his hand at a specific time when he comes home, and his children's needs tended to by his wife and household staff, who are to present them to him just long enough for him to \\"pat them on the head and send them off to bed.\\"   He is upset to find the children missing right around the time when he normally does that.But the local constable (Arthur Treacher) brings them home and their latest infraction leads their parents to search for a new nanny. While Mr. Banks would prefer someone solemn and cross for the position, the children write their own advertisement, for a kind, cheerful, and fairly pretty nanny who can have fun with them, and show them a bit more warmth. In reciting their preference to their father, they even point out their desire for someone who will not provoke their worst behaviors by scolding and dominating them.   After they go to bed, their father tears up their ad and throws it into the unlit fireplace, where the pieces are picked up by a mysterious wind and reassemble in the hands of Mary Poppins.   The next day, after another gust of wind blows away the queue of dour-looking applicants  for the job, Mary Poppins arrives with the childrens' ad in hand, much to the bafflement of Mr. Banks, who allows her to begin a trial period with the children, delighted with her initial presentation.   But she promises to stay only until the wind changes...   Upon entering the nursery, the young nanny almost immediately begins sprinkling stardust on the childrens' lives, removing a  plant, coat rack and other items from a carpetbag that appears too small to hold them, and with a dulcet and tuneful tone, turns cleaning up the nursery into a delightful game.   Afterwards, she takes them on an outing to the park, where  Bert, now working as a screever, greets them.All four are soon magically transported into one of Bert's chalk drawings, dressed stylishly, and enjoying an outing at an outdoor cafe where  animated penguins wait on them, they enjoy a carousel ride, and their carousel horses take them to join a fox hunt, and they end up in a derby race, which a flushed Mary Poppins wins,introducing the word, \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" to describe her feelings at doing so.They are entertained by pearlies before the rain brings their festivities to an end.To prevent her charges from becoming ill from exposure to the rain, the nanny gives them medicine, and takes some herself, with strawberry, lime cordial and rum punch coming out of one bottle.Her melodious method for getting them to sleep after an exciting day is to sing a song of reverse psychology called \\"Stay Awake\\".   The next day, the little dog Andrew interrupts their plans to go to the fish monger's by alerting them to the fact that Bert's Uncle Albert(Ed Wynn) is stuck on the ceiling  after a laughing spasm set him alight.They join both him and Bert there in a riotous episode.   The young nanny's presence brings a cheerful air to the whole household, and even the domestics are on better terms with each other. Mr. Banks, however, is annoyed  by the children's constant tales of their adventures with their nanny, complaining that they are no preparation for the practicalities of the real world.After his discussion with Mary Poppins, it is agreed that the children will accompany their father to his bank. In preparation for the next day's events, they are lullabied to sleep with the story of the old bird woman( Jane Darwell)outside  St. Paul's Cathedral.    Father and son have differing views about spending Michael's tuppence: Mr.Banks believes his son should deposit it in the bank while Michael wants it to feed the birds.The elder and junior Mrs Dawes(Dick Van Dyke and Arthur Malet) are among Bank's colleagues urging Michael to invest the tuppence with them.When the Sr. Dawes takes the coin without Michael's expressed consent, we see that children will be children, and Michael fights to get the tuppence back. The commotion from the incident leads other patrons to  misinterpret the situation and there is a panic that temporarily shuts down business.   Frightened by the chaos, the children bolt, hurrying into the East London slums, where, after dodging a few potential hazards, they encounter Bert, currently working as a chimney sweep. They tell him what has happened, and before he takes them home, he explains that unlike them, their father has to work most of his problems out for himself, encouraging them to have some empathy for the person whom to them, often seems so foreboding.   En route to another suffragette rally, Mrs. Banks asks Bert to clean their chimney and look after the children, since Mary Poppins had a day off.Mary Poppins returns in time to see her charges get magically sucked up through the chimney to the roof, and another adventure begins.Bestriding the rooftops of London, partially by a staircase ofsmoke, bellowed into existance by Mary Poppins' umbrella, they eventually encounter Bert's fellow chimney sweeps, who entertain them with song and dance until Admiral Boom's fireworks chase them away.   As Mr. Banks faces the possibility of dismissal, Mary Poppins makes the children give their father the tuppance.   Mr. Banks verbally broods over the likelihood of shattered professional ambitions. But Bert gently reminds the reluctant Banks that his greatest legacy will be his children, and that spending time with them while they're young is also important.   Heading to the bank to face the music over Michael's behavior, Mr. Banks is ceremoniously sacked from his job. But suddenly the stories the children told him about their adventures with their nanny are employed to help him through when he is asked to make a statement.   The next day, while Mrs. Banks expresses her anxieties over her husband's failure to return after the previous night's appointment, her children are upstairs weeping over their nanny's impending departure.   But we will soon see how, metaphorically speaking, the wind has changed for the Banks Family, as Mary Poppins departs, having indirectly influenced even the lives of Mr. Banks' colleagues, and leaving a favorable situation in her wake. And what better way to spend a gloriously windy day but by flying a kite?   This intensely colorful film, a sentimental family favorite first viewed by my parents when they were newlyweds, strikes just the right balance between beautiful singing, wit, depth, and sheer joy, so that all generations can delight in this timeless classic.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when it was first released, but it made quite an impact.  The film was so gorgeous that some scenes are indelibly etched in my memory.  Polanski is arguably one the the greatest living directors, and already had a resume of critically acclaimed work (Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Tenant, Chinatown) by 1979. Tess represented a departure from his usual rather spare cinematic style and the arty psychological horror genre  - it's a dreamy sumptuous feast for the eyes.  The landscapes he creates are almost surreal in their beauty.  And Nasstasja Kinski in the lead role is well cast - she just oozes innocent sensuality and seduces the camera.  Yes, she was not even legal when filming began, and yes, she became sexually involved with the much older Polanski during filming, but lets put all that and other Polanski scandals aside for now. It was a different time - those kinds of affairs were not nearly as taboo.  Remember Woody Allen's Manhattan? This movie, and we film lovers, deserve a high-quality DVD or blu-ray transfer of this masterpiece.  C. Porter's 2004 review of the poor SE DVD transfer has made me decide not to purchase it.  The reviewer also laments that we will probably not get a better transfer for another 10 years, which means we have another 4 years to wait.  I have done a thorough web search and there is no mention at all about a new release.  How sad!

There's always someone complaining about this, or going on about her age - whatever - you take the time to complain, she must have affected you. I don't like every second of this concert, anymore than any other M extravaganza. But thats the beauty of it, there's always something for everyone and always a variety of style and originality. The new mix of Like A Prayer is a new favorite, INCREDIBLE. I can't wait to see what she does next. Long live the Queen!

B001UV4XX8|2.0|No... I did not buy this.  I always netflix movies that are borderline interesting for me to see if its worth buying.  I liked the movie for what its worth.  I may be mistaken but there was an episode on one of the twilight zone reincarnations devoted to this storyline.   But everyone has their own taste and this was ok for me.  What irked me was that there was not 1 feature on this disc.  This is a bluray.  No featurette, no commentary, no deleted scenes, no nothing. Nada. Zilch.  Why?  Charging 25 bucks or so for JUST a movie and a mediocre one at best?  Now that is truly insulting to the public.  Rent it... Don't buy it.  UPDATE:  I just read in the product description that there are features.  Well I couldn't find them.  The menu had 2 options:  Play and Languages.

As I have slowly built up my pantry, I have come to absolutely love nearly every recipe I have tried in this cookbook. They are delicious, accessible, and I feel a strange sense of pride serving food that EVERYONE thinks is tasty and knowing that they are vegan and usually gluten- and sugar-free.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is an amazing read. Larsson has crafted a deeply layered, tightly paced thriller that is nearly impossible to put down once it gets started.<br /><br />  Plenty of reviews have gone over the plot and basics of the story, so I won't do that here, suffice to say that this as as finely crafted a mystery/thriller as I have ever read. Instead, I'll focus on what I think is one of the highlights of this book for me: Characterization. Larsson's talent for creating fully realized, authentically human characters is one of his true strengths.<br /><br />  Starting with our introduction to Mikael Blomkvist it becomes immediately obvious that this is not your average cardboard cut-out of a hero. He is at once complex and all too human in his compulsions and failings. He is a man of principles, but not one above making mistakes and using poor judgment. Through Blomkvist, we are introduced to what seems to be the primary story of the book only to find that it is indeed a secondary story, setting a chain of events into play that propel us into the real mystery at the core of the book. Blomkvist's journey is made all the more compelling because he is such a complex and interesting character.<br /><br />  In fact, every character in this book is incredibly well realized, right down to the bit players. Larsson creates an amazing cast filled with crooked businessmen, back-stabbing siblings, Nazi sympathizers, and worse. Indeed, the Vanger family history is so rich that it would have made a fine novel in and of itself.<br /><br />  Where we are truly blessed is with Larsson's greatest creation: Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />  This character is a revelation. Much has been written about her, and I do not intend to rehash all of it here, suffice to say that I was completely sucked in to her story, and found myself thinking of her more and more as a person, and not a character in a book. Complex, troubled, brilliant and dangerous, and equal parts delicate, damaged, loyal and frightened. Layer upon layer, creating a vivid and living character that you find yourself wanting to know more and more about with each revelation.<br /><br />  I can't say enough good about this book, about this world that Larsson has created. I am saddened to know that after reading the trilogy, there will be no more.er upon layer, creating a vivid and living character that you find yourself wanting to know more and more about with each revelation.

0670021652|1.0|Like many I had been looking forward to Gilbert's next book and no I wasn't expecting another EPL but I did expect her insight, depth and beauty to shine through and for me it didn't.  I felt like I was reading a neurotic person's rambling journal.  It was trite, banal and lacked passion.  With worldwide economic collapse and issues that are far more close to my heart, her privileged dilemmas hardly felt compelling.  In EPL there were universal themes many of us could relate to and reflect on but this seemed like issues to be discussed with her therapist.  I had to fight boredom to get through it.  And finally I'm disappointed in yet another woman whose ultimate happy ending is defined by a man in her life.  EPL started with how shattered she was when man number one was exiting and the book had a happy ending with man number two entering.  The follow up book is obsessed with the idea of commitment to man number two, again man-centered.   To me it was a waste of money even if you're interested in reading about marriage.  In my opinion it was poorly written.   Sorry but to whom much is given much is expected, we know you can do better Elizabeth.

B002RVZV9K|3.0|If you're a rock guitar player, you may enjoy this. But everyone else will probably be a bit bored as Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White discuss their love affairs with guitars. Page, of course, has by far the longest and most interesting bio of the three, while White, at age 34, is still evolving, and the Edge is concerned mainly with his many effects pedals and boxes to make his guitar sound like anything but. The three only jam a bit at the end on a Zep tune and one by The Band. That's when the movie is most interesting, although I really enjoyed one of the deleted scenes in which Page describes how he came up with the guitar riff on \\"Kashmir,\\" as the Edge looks on fascinated. White seems clearly less reverent about the other two than the Edge does toward Page. When you look back at who created what, however, it's clear that Page will probably leave the biggest legacy. Watch this film if you like films about rock music.

B00005M989|5.0|I've owned this CD (\\"The Very Best Of Prince\\") since it's release (2000) and after reading the reviews posted by others (as I often do), I feel an obligation to share my opinion of this particular compilation. Although \\"The Very Best\\" falls short in terms of quanity when compared to \\"The Hits/The B Sides\\", in terms of production quality \\"The Very Best\\" has far better 'sound quality' and for a single disc collection, the choice of material is 'the very best' and unlike the 'hits', all of the songs are in chronilogical order (which is always a plus, in my book). The 2007 release \\"Ultimate Prince\\" is also a fine compilation, but although this is a double disc CD there are still several 'hits' that were not included in that compilation...\\"Erotic City\\", \\"Adore\\" and \\"Sexy M.F.\\" to name a few (although, I understand that 2 of those tracks were originally intended for the \\"Ultimate\\" but were later omitted. Anyway, the point that I'm really trying to make is, an artist like Prince cannot possibly be anthologized on a single (\\"The Very Best Of\\"), double (\\"Ultimate\\") or even triple disc (\\"The Hits/The B Sides\\") collection...It's just not possible! And until Warners or NPG can produce a single disc collection of 'hits' that can surpass \\"The Very Best Of Prince\\" this will be the undisputed champion of single disc compilations and 5 stars worthy in my Prince collection!
0525421580|4.0|I've been waiting for this book to come out since it was announced. Some background on my reading history: I love all of John Green's books and I love what I've read of David Levithan. So, naturally, I had high hopes for this awesome collision of genius.     Will Grayson, Will Grayson is the story of two guys named Will Grayson: they are not related, they have close to nothing in common, and neither, in fact, knows that the other one exists. That is, until their volatile meeting in the middle of this book. In a porn store. In life-crumbling circumstances.     As usual with these two authors, the characters are realistically crafted and easy to relate to. There were times throughout the story that I felt myself nodding in sympathy or feeling vindictive hatred for the unfortunately dead-on portrayal of selfishness and angst that's common in most high school teenagers. What I love about these characters is that they are decidedly fluid individuals who learn life lessons and cry and hope and dissect situations to ridiculous extremes and hold grudges and appreciate love and friendship. This is the kind of book that reminds you what a coming of age tale is supposed to be.     My favorite character was Tiny Cooper. If I had to choose my favorite Will Grayson, I would choose Tiny Cooper. He was just that awesome. Tiny is the very large, very gay, and very fabulous best friend of John Green's Will Grayson. He has received funding from the student council in order to put on a musical he wrote himself called Tiny Dancer--which is, of course, all about Tiny Cooper. He is the show stealer of the book.     On the opposite end of the character spectrum, I never felt much of a connection with Jane, the love interest of John Green's Will Grayson. This is probably because I've come to expect much of John Green's girls. I was infatuated with Alaska Young and Margo was a fantastic multi-dimensional character. I had the same sort of problem with Jane as I did with the heroine of An Abundance of Katherines--I just never fell in love with her.     As for Levithan, I'm still pondering why he chose to write his portion using no capitals. I like to think that it's because his Will Grayson is just too apathetic to care about using a shift key. Authors trying to be innovative with the stylizing their narrative is usually a hit or miss for me. In Levithan's case, the innovation wasn't so over the top that it became pretentious, which--and I'm not naming any names--tends to happen.     For what's it worth, I have absolutely no regrets for paying the twenty dollar price for this book. John Green and David Levithan are a witty powerhouse of a team and I hope that they decide to do more work together in the future. I recommend Will Grayson, Will Grayson to all fans of humorous, romantic, intelligent coming of age tales.

B0007XT87G|2.0|This is the type of prog-rock that I find extremely boring and pretentious.  The singer is average at best and the pace of the album is rather plodding.  If you want to hear some creative prog-rock, try Spock's Beard or Umphrey's McGee instead.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|. . . \\"Bankster Takeover: The Completion of What 911 Started.\\"  .

006135323X|2.0|Initially I found this book quite fascinating. Some of the theories, and the experiments conducted to back up those theories, were very entertaining reading. Then I realised after about 50 pages, that the rest of the book was essentially just more of the same: simple theories (that are actually just common sense, when you really think about it) with entertaining experiments to provide some 'proof'. So, I gave up on the book.<br /><br />Reading a book is a big investment in time, and unless one finds it engaging, entertaining or informative, it's difficult to press on and dedicate so much time. Perhaps I'll return to it sometime in the future.

0307463745|4.0|After the buzz I've seen generated by this book, I needed to read it to find out what it was all about... Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.  They are the guys who started the web company 37signals, a company that has found a sizable niche with software products that are simple and basic.  There are enough features to get the job done, and no more.  In Rework, they share their philosophy on how a company should be started and run, based on how they've run their own company.  While I won't say that I agree with everything in here, they do cut through a lot of the red tape and bureaucracy you see in far too many companies today.  You could say this is a book of common sense for those who have forgotten just what that means in an organizational environment.<br /><br />Rework is divided up into a number of sections: Takedowns, Go, Progress, Productivity, Competitors, Evolution, Promotion, Hiring, Damage Control, and Culture.  Each section then has a number of one to three page topics within that section that talk to different aspects.  For instance, under Evolution, you'll find topics such as Say No By Default, Let Your Customers Outgrow You, and Don't Confuse Enthusiasm With Priority.  The writing is short, blunt, and to the point, and that's where the value comes in.  You don't have to fish around to figure out what the writers are trying to say.  If they say ignore the real world, they'll tell you why.  Too many people think your idea might be interesting, but won't work \\"in the real world.\\"  Fried and Hansson think the real world is far too pessimistic, and their company is based on things that shouldn't work in the real world... a dozen employees spread out in eight cities on two continents, no salespeople or advertising, and telling the world exactly what makes your company tick.  Yet, their company makes millions every year.  Go figure.  Instead, try out your idea anyway.<br /><br />I found a number of new insights that adjusted my thinking during the reading of the book.  I'd never thought about \\"selling my by-products.\\"  Instead of just selling an application, perhaps you can also sell the story behind the application or articles on how the application was built.  Another lesson was to make tiny decisions.  If you try and make a huge decision, you can get locked into indecision or end up fearful of the potential ramifications.  Instead, focus on the first step and decision that needs to be made.  Make it and move forward.  If it works, keep going. If it doesn't, then you can stop with little cost or investment.<br /><br />So do I agree with everything here?  No.  This all works great for a small company with this type of mindset ingrained in its culture.  I can see it also working relatively well with small teams within a larger company.  But if you're a multi-billion dollar company with Wall Street demands, can you truly work from a basis of letting your customer outgrow you?  No.  On the other hand, should you have a product that meets 80% of the needs of people, and then let them outgrow that to another product that you make, building customer loyalty along the way?  Perhaps.  However, there are parts of this book that apply to companies of *any* size.  ASAP is poison... Meetings are toxic... Cultures happen... Those are all true, and all too often overlooked or ignored.<br /><br />This book should only take you a couple hours to read, but the messages can significantly change the way you view your work and your organization.  Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with some (or many) of the points, Rework is a recommended read.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Publicist<br />Payment: Freeof the book.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|This is the 31st book I've read on my Kindle and while I have no complaints about the actual story, the translationn into the e-reader format is poor at best. there is missing punctuation and missing spaces between words on almost every page. This makes an already challenging piece of literature even more challenging to read. I wish there was a more stringent editing process in place.
888370536X|4.0|I bought this notebook, (the MOLESKINE POCKET MUSIC NOTEBOOK), some time back, but only seriously began looking at it today.....    It certainly is a \\"pocket-size\\" notebook -- very handy.  And the  music staffs within are made with nice big spaces between the lines, and between the staffs themselves.  The staffs are drawn with nice light lines -- so that one need NOT use a marker pen, (which could \\"bleed\\" to the other side, or smudge on the one side.)  So any writing instrument -- from pencil to ballpoint, or any other writing instrument of one's choice can be used to write music.  Also, the lines are light enough, not to interfere with the occasional drawing or sketch -- if the musician/composer is also, (like me), an aspiring artist as well....    I had never heard of the MOLESKINE mini-books before seeing them on Amazon.com -- but the leaflet that comes with the Moleskine Music Pocket notebook has pictures of the entire line: 22 different mini-notebooks for different purposes. From a plain, baic, ruled notebook, (pocket - 192 page, large 240 pages), to a \\"Japanese Album\\" (which contains triple in folded sheets -- with '60 zigzag folded pages, of top quality heavy paper. For photos, collages, and sequences\\", and a \\"Storyboard Notebook\\", containing 'a sequence of frames, 2 or 4 per page, for drawing mini-stories. For advertizing creatives and graphic designers.  Pocket: 80 pages of heavy, top-quality paper\\" -- and just about everything in between, each mini-notebook is described, and accompanied by a mini(!)drawing, so one can at once grasp the format of each mini-notebook, and the purposes for which they are intended.  Pocket-size notebooks are 3 1/2\\" x 5 \\", large size notebooks (where available), are 5\\" x 8 1/4\\", and Extra-large size \\"cahiers\\", are also available in Extra-large size, which is 7  7 1/2\\" x 10 1/4\\".  Page counts in all the notebooks and cahiers varies from 60 pages to 240 pages, depending on the page counts available for each individual notebook/ cahier style. Moleskine seems to have cornered the market in producing all kind of useful mini-notebooks, and a few larger ones as well!     On the reverse side of the leaflet, is a history of the company.  The first paragraph starts: \\"Moleskin is the legendary notebook used by European artists and thinkers for the past two centuries, from Van Gogh to Picasso, from Ernest Hemmingway to Bruce   Chatwin....\\"  It goes on to recount how the company gradually went out of business, with the last manufacturer stopping production in 1986. But in 1998, a small Milanese publisher brought Moleskine back again...!  The complete text of this history, (\\"The History of A Legendary Notebook\\"), goes on for four paragraphs, (with some self-congratulatory -- but truly deserving --words), and below it is a \\"Quality Control No. 4817\\" subheading, stating that each Moleskine notebook is made by hand, and checked for quality.  An e-mail address is given, for any faults which might found, and the customer is invited to send a photograph, and a description of, the problem to that e-mail address -- because, it seems, THIS company really does care about the quality of its products, and wants to know if anything is amiss, so it can be fixed!  : )  The \\"Quality Control\\" messages is printed only in English -- but the \\"History of A Legendary Notebook\\" is printed in English,   Italian, French, German, Spanish, and Chinese!    It's OK, I think, for a good product to contain some self-congratulatory literature. Besides giving a choice of small, (or medium or large), and of varied types, all of the notebooks /cahiers in the the Moleskine line are made with acid-free paper of various kinds.  I'd much rather see a self-congratulatory leaflet for Moleskine products, (which company, it seems, does not do much other advertising), than for the VERY poor quality goods and services, of all kinds, (which often do a LOT of advertising), that flood our TV commercials, and print ads, most of the time.    So, why doI give this product only 4 stars?  It's because, I suppose, that I've been spoilt.  Years ago, you see, a company called National Stationery produced a line of mini looseleaf notebooks.  These ran in size from, I think, 3 1/2\\" x 5\\", to 4\\" x 6\\".  They looked just like regular loose-leaf binders -- but they had flexible black leatherette, (ok, plastic), covers, and they were miniaturized!  They were advertized as holding 150 sheets...but I think I've crowded about 300 sheets into the one I have.  Boorum and Pease made mini-sheets to fit these mini notebooks.  One could -- just as in other loose-leaf notebooks -- place sheets in different areas of the notebook.  The portablilty of these mini-looseleaf notebooks by National Stationery was great...but all of a sudden, they disappeared!  And so did the mini-filler paper!    As a maker of quality notebooks -- perhaps of THE Quality Notebooks -- I herein respectfully request, (read: beseech!), Moleskine to consider making mini LOOSE-LEAF binders and filler paper, for those of us who like the freedom of changing pages easily, and not being bound by a ....bound notebook!  The MOLESKINE line of notebooks -- including the wonderfully beautiful, and incredibly practical music notebook which, as described above, can be put to \\"fine art\\" and drawing use as well,  is a wonderful thing.  But it hems the user in, as bound books always do.  A loose-leaf edition of this notebook -- and as many of the other notebooks offered by MOLESKINE, as well, would be SO very welcome!
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Product was purchased as a gift for a social worker.  She is enjoying the series and finds it is informative as well as enjoyable.  I watched the series as well and found I couldn't wait to get back to it to see the treatment progress.  I recently ordered series two.
B00005QGAT|5.0|When Michael Jackson released Thriller and Bad in the 80s those two albulms tended to overshadow this one since they were both so revolutionary and offered many top billboard hits, but this albulm is still one of Michaels greatest albulms and helped Michael start off his solo career on a high note. There is a good variety of songs which showcase Michael's early recordings like Don't Stop til you get enough, Rock with You, and Off the Wall, as well as what Michael was singing before the early pop era. As much as I am not a fan of disco, I feel Michael really provides good vocals, and the songs aren't too strongly geared towards disco, they tend to break off into different genres such as early pop and even a little R&B sounding. Maybe this albulm isn't as big as Thriller or Bad, but it definitly offers some great early Michael Jackson songs, and is better than the modern Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga crap, no offense if you're a fan of those two. And you can find it for dirt cheap due to it being overshadowed by Michael's other albulms.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I caught Let the Right One In at an international film series showing in my town some time ago and was immediately sucked in.  Enjoyed the film, had some great conversation about it afterward and rushed home to buy the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the fact that they didn't go over the top with effects, it was very refreshing, (take a hint Hollywood)  The story was magnificent and I thought they did a great job converting the script for the film, the Hakan sub-plot was both scary and revolting and I think it would have changed the tenor of the film dramatically, I like them both for what they are.<br /><br />Great movie, I highly recommend it.
B0000025RI|5.0|I know some may disagree but this albulm offers Michael Jackson at his best, and features some of pops most superb music and beats, with Michael's revolutionary Thriller, to Billie Jean, to the easy listening songs like The Girl is Mine with Paul McCartney and Baby Be Mine. If you do not own any albulms by Michael or are a newcomer to pop, this is a must buy. I find this is better than the new Thriller 25, which features a ton of extra generic, lame attempts by modern musicians at trying to mimic the late great, king of pop, which nobody can do as good as him. The only problem is this CD is not compatible with all CD players so you might want to get the 2001 remaster just in to be safe. But try to avoid Thriller 25, as it does have the originals, but also has a lot of crap by generic artists that taint the CD a little.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I have been watching all the Stargate SG-1 episodes on Hulu. I used to make fun of the show and now I seem to be addicted. As I was looking at the airdates, I saw how Stargate Atlantis was introduced. Since the first season wasn't available on Hulu, I decided to buy the first season and watch it on dvd.<br /><br />I was skeptical the first couple of episodes but as the first season pushed on it really grabbed me. By the end of season 1 I was ready to start season 2. As season 9 of SG-1 started up, it has already begun to disappoint me. But season 2 of Stargate Atlantis has proven to be a good replacement.<br /><br />I was glad to find the Stargate Atlantis DVD collection used on Amazon for a cheaper price (Cheaper than renting each disc individually at the video store). It was in good condition and the picture quality on HD looks very good (discs are not Blue Ray but the video quality is very good).<br /><br />I would recommend the series for anyone interested in Sci Fi.
B00005QGAX|5.0|There are so many quality songs on this CD and although it doesn't offer a lot of songs, it does offer some of Michael's best pop songs to date. Bad is a brilliant song and offers a variety of pop talent from different artists including the great jazz organist Jimmy Smith. Aside from its main title, it offers other career top songs like Smooth Criminal, Dirty Diana, and The Way You Make me Feel. There are a few easy listening Michael songs on this albulm too like Man in the Mirror and Another Part of me. Overall for this cheap price, you are getting some of Michaels greatest songs and there are no songs on this albulm I would consider unworthy or boring. It is worth the 10 or so bucks and one of the smartest buys in music you will make. One thing is the interviews are kind of just filler material and are nice to listen to once, but get annoying having to skip them to get to the next song. There are also a few previously unreleased songs on this remastered CD like Streetwalker and Fly Away, so you are getting a better deal buying this than the original. Overall, you are getting one of Michael's best albulms for a very low price.
B001EN71DG|4.0|The reviews had me reluctant to spend a mere $25 on this classic trilogy. It's a shame I came that close to NOT treating myself (decades later) and my kids to the Star Wars experience. Yes, the quality is lower than one expects from today's DVDs, but such is the quality of that era's movie productions compared to today's. As one reviewer stated, it's still better than VHS.    I was about my son's age when Star Wars came out in the theater. It was something special to see him express the same enthusiasm and interest in these stories. We watched the original theatrical version, since that is what I remember seeing, but I imagine the 2nd time through we'll watch the special edition just to see what changed (and to experience the better surround sound encoding).    Seeing the original trilogy has renewed my interest in the prequel trilogy, which I am going to order now. I lost interest after seeing episode I (one), but my son wants to see them, and admittedly, so do I.
0061914177|5.0|I've spent the past 48 hours more or less consumed by Gary Vaynerchuk. I'd heard about him and finally got around to reading his book, Why Now is the Time to Crush It!.    The book is only 142 pages and you can read it in a sitting. But when you finish it, you won't be able to sleep very well. He will challenge you to take whatever your passion is, and use social media to turn it into something big. Once you check out his websites, he gets his claws into you even deeper, with loads of videos in which this sloppily dressed, potty-mouthed guy with a high-pitched voice makes you squirm, knowing that you are not working nearly hard enough to make your vision come to life.

0471043729|5.0|I am studying Lithium Ion battery modeling.  I found that this book serves as a excellent tool to bridge the gap between the undergraduate book on electrochemistry and the one by Newman.  To do modeling, you absolutely need the book by Newman.  But Newman's book is hard to read.  Bard's book gives you good ideas on how things work and Newman's tells you precisely how things work.  Without having a good idea first, it is hard to understand the more precise and general language used by Newman.    I am only interested in modeling.  My review is more relevant to that aspect.

0061914177|5.0|Informative read, definitely great info on how to take your area of expertise, create content, publish and create an income stream.  For those exposed to internet marketing a bit, some information will be familiar, but continues to elevate information and motivate to action, probably the most important step.<br />If you \\"get it\\" and really start consuming, you can read in a weekend, and re read to use for action steps.<br />It's for sure a great book to expose to the uninformed masses many of the ways that people are becoming amazing content creators and making quite a living from it.<br />I highly recommend the book, go out, get it and act!!
0061914177|5.0|Good book or good movie - you really know three weeks later when it is still affecting you!  I am infected - a believer in what it means for internet marketing to be viral. Gary gives hope and inspiration with a kick in the butt at the same time. This is not a get rich quick book but challenges a person that wants to capitalize on the changing market the opportunity to make money with any topic they are passionate about.  To me, it is not about the technical content (you can get that stuff any where) - it is about being a Jerry MaFingMaguire!   If you don't like the book, give it to a friend- they will \\"get it\\" and thank you!
0061914177|5.0|When I first came across \\"Crush It!\\", I hadn't heard of Gary Vaynerchuk.  I was also suspicious of a book that includes the words \\"Cash In\\" on the front cover.  Nevertheless, I bought the audio book and gave it a chance.   I not only enjoyed it (I went out and bought the hardcover edition), I appreciated the perspective of looking at the Internet and Social Networking as a set of tools from which each individual and company can design a strategy that works for them.  This isn't a step-by-step guide - it's a realistic call to action, with numerous case studies defining how these tools can be put to use.  \\"Crush It!\\" doesn't tell you what to do - it presents a way of thinking - an attitude with which to look at the vast new opportunities we all have to achieve our entrepreneurial goals.    It's the only business book that actually impacted the way I do business.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I have always enjoyed guitar groups whether they be the surf instrumental bands from the US, The Searchers, The Byrds or Boston to name just a few.  When it comes to Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler compilations this is it!  Starting Disc 1, well Telegraph Road is a massive track of beyond 14 minutes, then it's Sultans Of Swing.  This is a debut single to rival The Animals' House Of The Rising Sun, Jimi Hendrix Experiance's Hey Joe and Don Mclean's American Pie.  Both Romeo And Juliet and Tunnel Of Love are driving rock numbers of high quality.  There are a number of quieter songs, the thoughtful Love Over Gold, a sad and insightful Private Investigations, then Brothers In Arms and Your Latest Trick really slow things down, but it's still some of the best rock around.  So Far Away and Walk Of Life are lesser works and the sentiments of Money For Nothing are really dire !  For me Disc 2 only has Going Home, but Disc 1 is the real deal.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I was really skeptical about Lady Gaga's music at first. The first album took me a while to get into but with this album, I'm completely drawn in by her music. \\"The Fame Monster\\" has tracks that are all winners in my book. My favorites are 'Alejandro,' 'Bad Romance' and 'Dance in the Dark.' I think that this CD works because Lady Gaga has clearly put her heart and soul into the work. It's all fun and dance-worthy but at the same time, the music and lyrics can be quite insightful. I can't recommend \\"The Fame Monster\\" any more highly than this. Get it and check it out.
0143038095|5.0|When I turned thirty, I was angry and unhappy, but didn't really know it.  I figured that niggling feeling, the one I couldn't really identify, the one that wouldn't go away, was the natural result of having two little kids, too much time with nothing to think about on my hands,  and, thanks to living in Iran, a really foreign country, a serious case of culture shock.<br /><br />I believed that the unexamined life was absolutely worth living. Probing too deeply into my psyche, to my way of thinking, wasn't going to lead me anywhere good. I prided myself on being a survivor. Someone who didn't waste her time dwelling on things that couldn't be changed. Someone that, when in the heart of something awfull, eventually adjusted, and then forgot what normal ever looked like to begin with.<br /><br />Plus, it was a whole bunch easier on my marriage if I didn't dig around in all that inner mud.If I didn't put a voice to what it was that I really wanted. Or felt.<br /><br />Somewhere early on, all by myself, I had decided that my feelings were never as credible or important as those of my husband. So atuned to small shifts in his mood, in his body language, in his tone, I could sense what he wanted, what he felt, long before he came out with it himself. Long before I could figure out what was going on inside my heart.<br /><br />And when things did boil over--as they will, even when you decide to ignore your secret rage--I was quick to blame myself.<br /><br />Being angry at my husband quickly evolved into being angry with myself.<br /><br />I assumed that discord sprang from my lack.

I feared losing the relationship far more than losing my self.<br /><br />Perhaps it was my Mom who'd sent me the book. Or maybe I'd borrowed it from one of my ex-patriot friends. But, the timing couldn't have been more serendipitous. The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan centered on the lives of four Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters. And while the complicated relationships between two generations and  two different cultural mindsets resonated with me, it was the floundering marriage of one of the daughters that held me in its grip.<br /><br />How is it that when you can't see the mistakes of your own life because they're too up close and personal, when you're used to distracting yourself from yourself with an ever- present, vague sense of panic, it's easier to see the truth--the truth about yourself-- when observing a fictional character? How is it that other people's problems, even made up ones, are easier to face than one's own?<br /><br />Married to a man who possesses all the power in the relationship, Lena St. Clair, prompted by a visit from her mother, begins to evaluate her marriage with the eyes of an outsider:<br /><br />\\"She can see all this. And it annoys me that all she sees are the bad parts. But then I look around and everthing she's said is true..she knows what's going to happen to us...And she looks at me and frowns but doesn't say anything.

044654146X|4.0|In April 2002, author Dan Senor took twelve Harvard business school classmates from various nationalities with him to Israel.  After studying Israel's economy for a week, many of them were intrigued by the dearth of innovation and entrepreneurship in a country of only 7 million.  A search by Mr. Senor and Mr. Singer for a publication that shed light on what baffled the Harvard B-School students turned up nothing.  So the two authors set out to research and publish \\"Start-Up Nation\\", and identify the reasons why Israel, a country created less than a century ago is a hotbed of innovation.    With all of the negative press about Israel, \\"Start-Up Nation\\" is a welcome change.  The authors, however, seemed to be more interested in selling Israel Inc. as a viable recipient of foreign capital than providing a successful blueprint for other nations and companies to emulate.  Much of Israel's economic miracle can be attributed to cultural and geopolitical factors.  According to Shimon Peres, one of the most highly influential Israeli politicians who helped craft Israel's economic success, \\"The greatest contribution of the Jewish people in history is dissatisfaction.  That's poor for politics but good for science.\\"  Start-Up Nation does a decent, albeit somewhat unbalanced job of covering the science part.  The politics aspect which was largely ignored in the book will play an integral part in Israel's long term success as a nation.    Start-Up Nation is just as important a publication for business readers as foreign politics and military enthusiasts.
0061914177|5.0|First of all, I must say Crush It isn't for everyone. But if it's for you, you'll know it and love it. Gary has a great message of motivation and empowerment to the go-getters of the world. If you're looking for an outline of steps to follow to get rich you'll be deeply disappointed and may even turn into a 1-star-review-hater. Crush It exposes people to many great on-line tools and attempts to explain how they can be beneficial to your product, service, or content offering. Gary never ever talks about getting rich quick. He goes to extreme measures to convey that nothing is quick or easy, but everything through hard work, time, and sweat equity can be had and is within reach.    Keep at it Gary! You've been a tremendous help and inspiration to many many people - especially me. Thank you. :)
0439023491|5.0|This second book in the series still rates five stars.  The compelling narrative, and the heroine's character carry us through and then some.  Like many middle books in a trilogy, it does not live up to the first book, which was fresher and was a complete story on its own, and, I expect will be exceeded by the third book, which is set up perfectly by this one.  As a big Katniss, fan, however, I was not disappointed here, and neither was my son.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|When I saw the trailer for this film many months ago, I thought it looked like a rip off of The Bad Seed and The Good Son. Orphan is a well made thriller with a very creepy and amazing performance by Isabelle Fuhrman. In fact all of the kids in this film are so good they out shine the adults in every way.<br /><br />The film starts slowly, but always keeps you interested. I know others have stated that the film is boring, but I really have to disagree as I was never bored in its almost two hour running length. The film has some minor flaws, but it is still a very good thriller and way above average for this type of film. If the script had a few tweaks, this could have been one of the best thrillers of all time. It has so much potential because of the performances of Isabelle and her new siblings.<br /><br />The flaws....well, there are some plot holes and for a film that wants to simmer, they just don't give us a clear picture of the problems with the wife and loss of a child, sure we get the facts, but I think if you're going to slowly build a thriller like this, there is certainly room to give a detailed back story. It would have added a lot of weight later in the film. Of course the adoption is very quick and I find it hard to believe a woman with these issues would have been granted the child so quickly, but that is a minor detail and I'm sure the director was trying to move the film along. The ending is a little too Hollywood for me, but I sure didn't see the plot twist coming and that is saying something in itself!<br /><br />There are so few good thriller these days that I have to be forgiving with this film. I appreciate no CGI and believe me when this film gets going this kid is creepy as.... H E L L ! This film took me completely by surprise and came very close to greatness. It is destine to become a cult classic!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Ah? Why are people reviewing a product that has not been released?  Hey man, just askin'.
1931559317|5.0|The Pocket Sky Atlas was produced by Roger Sinnott after previously publishing the well known Sky Atlas 2000.0. Not surprisingly it is very similar in style and format, but being more recent, the PSA has some subtle improvements (I own both atlases). Firstly, the names of the constellations are bigger. As astronomers usually know which constellation their looked-for object is in, this takes you to the right area of the map much quicker. Secondly, more objects in PSA are given their proper names. For example, the galaxy simply numbered 5128 in SA 2000 is also given its proper name Centaurus A in PSA. Thirdly, and most importantly of all, the constellations in PSA are drawn in faint green lines, which also aids fast recognition. After all, who sees Scorpius as a set of unrelated stars? We all see it as a shape, and a very recognisable one at that. Because both atlases show many more stars than we can see with the naked eye, the green lines really draw the constellation stars out of that rich star field and show us which stars are the prominently visible ones. For this reason I have laboriously gone through my Sky Atlas 2000 maps with a green pencil drawing in all the constellation lines (using PSA as my guide of course). The larger number of stars in Sky Atlas 2000 does equate better with what you see through a 9 x 50 finderscope, but the PSA is not far off, and I still find it easy enough to use.   I must say that the PSA is superbly put together. It is easy to navigate from one map to another, there is a page showing the best viewing times for each set of maps (invaluable), a guide to constellations, a telrad finder reticle to the scale of the maps, a chart key showing the whole sky, a good general index and lists for Messier and Caldwell objects. Obviously a great deal of thought went into its compilation.  Although my copy has been wet with dew on several occasions, it has not shown any deterioration.  My only quibbles are minor ones. Since it won't fit into a pocket anyway, I wish it was just a little bigger, say A4 size. When you're looking at a part of the sky without many bright stars (e.g. Cancer) the small area of sky represented by a map can leave you with few clues as to where to look (this is why I use Sky Atlas 2000 as well). The Messier objects are given their Messier designations (e.g. M66) but the Caldwell objects, although listed at the back, are not. This is a shame, as it would have made it easier for those of us compiling our Caldwell lists.  In conclusion, despite the obvious limitations of its small size, this little masterpiece shows us how Sky Atlas 2000.0 should be.

0061914177|2.0|Gary Vee is right, now is the time crush it and clearly states why. However, did he need to write a book to explain it? Basically, this book should have been reduced to a (longish) magazine article.      Ultimately Crush It! is extremely similar to one of Gary Vee's talks, passionate, energizing and motivating.  However, if you're looking for some \\"how to\\" (or content for that matter) use the $15 for a subscription to INC Magazine and sign up to Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook for free.    I look forward to Gary Vee's next book but Crush It! leaves a lot to be desired.
B001JAFYFG|2.0|I know I'm not the first one here to say this, but let me join the chorus of voices taking Warner Bros. to task for another sloppy transfer.  The whole point of Blu-ray is increased picture and sound quality, isn't it (the \\"increased durability\\" claim means nothing to those of use who put their discs back in the cases when we're done with them)?  The really frustrating thing about this disc is that some scenes--especially those involving a lot of color--practically jump off the screen.  But often the picture becomes horribly grainy, which probably looks bad on ANY t.v., but looks absolutely atrocious on my 52\\" HDTV.<br /><br />Even the extras are lacking.  All you get is a commentary track, theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette.  With the available space on a Blu-ray disc, plus the fact that there are additional materials on the film out there (as seen in the laserdisc release), the whole package seems nothing more that a rehash of the previous DVD release.<br /><br />For the unintiated, the film itself is a minor classic, although certain aspects haven't aged well.  Feminists will run screaming at the blantant sexism (a feature common in the supposedly-enlightened future of the original Star Trek as well), and the bright pastel costumes might elicit a few chuckles today.  But the story remains strong, the effects are very well-done, and the film does succeed in creating a believable otherworld of the future.  And for those of us who came of age in the late 70's, there is a nostalgic charm (not to mention a briefly-nude Jenny Agutter) to keep things interesting.  But until a full restoration comes along, there is really no reason to get this Blu-ray if you already have the film on DVD.
0743268091|3.0|The headline I gave this review should not be viewed as pejorative because the term stems from, and is frequently used in, the Jewish community. It denotes that type of thinking process which knows the answer to a given problem and subsequently justifies it by a variety of reasons. As such it is the opposite of scientific investigations where a natural phenomenon is encountered and its possible reasons are then looked for. Inasmuch as Dr. Harris has in the past performed scientific work readers may assume that the book under discussion also uses the methods of science but this would be a mistake. Instead it is a well written one-sided polemic which champions reason over faith.   I had to, reluctantly, give the book three stars because it touches on fundamental aspects of what 21st century America really stands for. It deserves to be widely read and debated. On the other hand if the initiation of rational discourse was the author's intent he has failed because insulting hundreds of millions of human beings all over the globe for believing in a given religion is not the best way to do so. The major thesis of the book is: \\"Faith\\" is untenable when confronted with the facts of science and has done, throughout the past 2000 years, more harm than good. The book lists an impressive array of moral outrages members of the world's major religions have committed, but his special ire seems to be directed against the Muslim and Christian religion. The charges are correct, as far as they go, but they do not go to heart of the matter.   Harris uses the word \\"Faith\\" as exclusively referring to religious aspects of human life and even within religions he sees only the doctrinal structure rather than concerning himself with the personal aspects as William James has done more than one hundred years ago. Furthermore, he concentrates on dogmas (the virgin birth for Catholics and the 72 virgins for Muslims, are his favorite targets), which for many religious believers, regardless of religious affiliations, are not necessarily of primary importance. In addition he has equal disdain for those individuals who regard themselves as \\"moderate\\" in their religious belief system as for fundamentalists. While Harris spends a great deal of time and effort on religious dogmas his book presents us with a complete blind spot for the secular ones which determine current political decisions.   When he exhorts reason over religious faith as the panacea for the future of human conduct he seems to have forgotten the excesses of the French as well as those of the Russian revolution which occurred in its name. While he blames Hitler's \\"Christianity\\" for the murder of Jews and Stalin's early education in the Orthodox Church for his crimes one fails to find a single word about Lenin. Yet it was the latter who with the help of secular Jews, such as Trotsky, Dsershinskij (Lenin's Himmler) and others, committed crimes on an enormous scale, also in the name of reason.   Harris showed us his faith by apparently believing that three steel towers, two of which had been hit by planes, were by fire reduced to rubble in the manner of controlled explosions; that a plane can crash into the ground, or hit a building without leaving debris and body parts. The first event refers, of course, to the WTC towers as well as building VII, the second to the hole in the ground at Shanksville PA, and of that in the Pentagon. These \\"miracles\\" (defined as \\"singular events which defy natural explanations\\") are readily accepted by Harris, although they could be ranked with virgin birth. Like most of the rest of the country he believes in the 19 Muslim hijacker theory as the sole responsible agents. But this assumption has never been allowed to be tested in a criminal court and scientific examination of WTC dust showed residue from explosives, which cannot have resulted from the fires.   Harris also shows his colors when he wrote in regard to the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons that, \\"In such a situation, the only thing likely to ensure our survival may be a nuclear first strike of our own.\\" He goes on explaining that this would be a terrible thing to do, nevertheless he did posit it. There is no doubt that a nuclear armed Iran would be regarded as a threat to world peace but it does not follow that our \\"survival\\" would be at stake. The State of Israel's possibly, but not that of the U.S., unless we respond inappropriately. Harris' mental conflation of Israel's needs with those of the U.S. is common in our media, but erroneous and does not follow the laws of reason.  There is an additional interesting aspect. In his own neurophysiologic publication on \\"The Neural Correlates of Religious and Nonreligious Belief\\" he demonstrated that, what may be called, a belief system exists in the brain. But, and this is the crucial element, it is content neutral. With other words people believe or disbelieve whatever is currently acceptable and conforms to their thought strcture regardless whether the content is religious or secular.   I have discussed the problem of science and faith in \\"The Jesus Conundrum. Searching for Truth beyond Dogma [available on amazon.com]\\" and noted that faith is an inborn quality of the human being. It remains with us throughout our lives and only its target changes, depending upon life experiences. An \\"End of Faith\\" is, therefore, impossible. What we should do is to direct our faith into channels which are helpful to humanity; especially now where so much hatred and division rules the day in the socio-political arena. To exclusively blame religion is not only a disservice to the public but a dangerous falsehood.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I saw these guys on Abbey Road and immediately went and bought their album.  The band's tight, driving rockabilly rhythms, and May's smokey-sexy, subtly tremulous voice and aching, behind-the-beat phrasing are irresistable.  If there was ever an album that could give a guy blue balls, this is it.  I dare you to listen sitting down.
0307454541|3.0|The best thing about the book is the descriptions of Sweden, in landscape and cityscape.  This would make a great movie, because you can cut out the meandering of story and the tedium of character.  Every character is unlikeable, and the story itself is far-fetched to the point that I never forgot I was reading someone's attempt at a whodunit.  I could NOT, though I tried, lose myself in the story.  Nothing was believable, nothing.  I wouldn't purchase the other two in the series.  I gave the book away the second I was done with it.
B000UPGQQW|3.0|This is an 80s time capsule of hairstyles, actors, and vibe and it's not bad, but it's not great either.  Decent vampire make-up and familiar faces make it fun for nostalgia and it almost has a Spielberg-y kind of feeling, but I'd rent before buying. That should be enough for the curious.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I heard several rave reviews about this movie prior to watching it so I went in with great expectations.  I must say I thought there would be way more magic tricks featured in the film, since it's suppsed to be about rival magicians.  It seemed like they showed about 2 tricks then the war began to find out each other's secrets.  I was waiting for the wow factor.  However, about mid-way to the end, the excitement really picked up and I was very happy with the twisted ending.  Not my favorite movie, but very interesting to say the least and it didn't leave me disappointed.
0061914177|5.0|After 25 years of working for \\"corporate America\\" I was laid off in December 2009.  Just like 6 million other Americans I had to find a way to reinvent myself.  Then I found and read Gary's book \\"Crush It\\".  His book is easy to read but full of excellent advice in a entertaining way.  He gave me the motivation to follow my dreams.  I then published a small self help booklet: \\"Working from a Home Office Successfully\\"  ~ Best Practice Tips.  I have been following Gary's advice and watching his video's.  I am not even close to achieving his success.  However, Gary keeps me motivated and is helping many American's achieve their dreams too.  America is going through a corporate revolution.  Gary is giving us the tools and resources to be successful.  I can't wait for his next book.  He is the Warren Buffet of this generation.  Watch him, listen to him. We should all be so lucky to have his passion not only for work but life! I have never met Gary but hope if he visits Arizona I have the opportunity to shake his hand and say thank you.
0061914177|5.0|I have bought this book in hardback 3 times, keep lending it to people and never get it back. Finally, I bought it on Kindle so no one can take it from me!!! As a real beginner in social media, I have picked up a few books that make me want to cry over my lack of tech-knowledge. Gary's book is very simply written so that I can take what he suggests and easily apply it to my new blog. His energy is infectious and he makes you dream big. No, you may not borrow my Kindle.
0061914177|4.0|I am still reading this book, but each time I pick it up I do read something pretty original and inspiring.  It's not easy to be totally out of the box as so many books have been written in this space, however there are many gems, like going with your gut feel rather than web stats.  While I don't agree 100%, and think stats can be valuable to address problems on your site, the gut feel notion resonates with me and I will remember it when running my business - which will no doubt be invaluable.  If you can take a dozen things from this book and implement them, I think it's a worthy purchase.
0061914177|5.0|Whether you love or hate Gary Vaynerchuk, you've to respect his knowledge and drive.  In Vaynerspeak, it's called \\"hustle.\\"  I admit it took a good six months to appreciate Gary's bombastic Wine Library videocasts.  He's loud, in-your-face, opinioned and brash.  But he knows his stuff, tells it like he sees it, has a great heart, and is extremely generous.  He's authentic, and that reads in any medium.  He took a wine industry stuck in an elitist rut and made drinking wine fun and approachable and broadened the base of consumers.<br /><br />Gary's new book Crush It! drops tomorrow and he's revealing his secrets of success.  It's a simple \\"get off your ass, follow your passion, work like a sled dog, have fun with what you're doing and you'll prosper\\" pitch, and Gary makes his case in a simple, engaging manner.  He hits all the key points: Branding, Transparency, Storytelling, Differentiation and Marketing;  its done is such an easy way, the knowledge transfer is effortless.  The concepts are simple, but not simplistic.<br /><br />This is a great book for the people who get it (or want to get it), but it's an even better book for the people who don't.  The people who think the internet (and social media in particular) is a waste of time, need this book, even if you're just using the tome to smack them upside the head with it.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Twitter (and I take a rash of crap for it from the unenlightened.)  Yeah, Twitter is micro-blogging but it's macro-networking, and it's a free vehicle for your message.  It's a real-time way to connect and engage your customers.  For established businesses, Gary tells of how for his wine store he spent $7500 on a perfectly placed billboard, direct mail and radio advertising with a yield of 710 orders.  In contrast, Gary used Twitter to post a discount code and in two days received 1700 orders.  Not a bad return on investment, and a different take on how to use your resources.<br /><br />I'm going to share chapter nine in its entirety with you, titled: The Best Marketing Strategy Ever.  \\"CARE.\\" That's it.

B002UNMW7O|1.0|Seriously. This film is nothing like the original. NOTHING! It is atrocious, horrifically written and so low budget that it's disgusting. The director, producers and everyone else involved in this film should be kicked out of Hollywood for good. This movie was a disgrace. I was anticipating this movie for well over a year. I am so disappointed... I'm disgusted. Why does Hollywood allow such great movies (like the original Boondock Saints) with garbage sequels such as this?

I went on and then both my knees were hurting, as well as my hands.<br /><br />Like I said, it is a good workout but not a daily one for me, I will use Fitness Coach and jogging along with this.

0307454541|4.0|I was given this paperback for a Christmas gift from an in-law who shares my penchant for murder mysteries. He related that the book is slow to start but if I can get past the first 5 pages or so, a great story is delivered. The character development is exceptional and I enjoyed the story very much. But yes, there was some pages in the beginning that made me yawn. After that I couldn't put the story down. I also thought it went on a bit long but there is an upside to this- I didn't want it to end because I had become enamored with the characters. I have since read the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\". It was even better! My only regret is I have finished it. :( These are characters that will stay with you long after you finish the book. I am so excited to read the third sequel, \\"The Girl Who Kicked a Hornets Nest\\", that I did what I rarely do - I ordered the Hardcover version, which will be released in May, 2010.  I just can't wait for the paperback. It is such a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|For a Michael Moore movie, this was alright.  It points out a lot of the problems with the American style of capitalism.  The best parts in my opinion were pointing out the strong connections between corporate business leaders and presidential advisors, especially in the Reagan and Clinton administrations, and also their ties to congressional leadership.  Most everything about this movie has already been said in these reviews.  My criticisms are these:<br /><br />1) There is not suggestion on what might be a better system.  Europe and Japan are mentioned but not investigated.  There is only condemnation of what America has done in the past 30 years.  What's the solution?<br /><br />2) There is a huge cognitive disconnect regarding Barack Obama.  Only positive things are said about him and his election is portrayed as some kind of people's revolution.  I understand Moore does not like the Reagan or Bush people.  That's understandable. But Moore pretty much savaged some Clinton advisors like Robert Rubin and Larry Summers and their complicity in the financial meltdown.  OK, Summers in an economic advisor in the Obama administration and Geithner is advised by Rubin.  It seems to me the good ol' boy system is intact under Obama.  If you're going to point out how Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Tim Geithner, Larry Summers, et al all work to enrich the banks, then how can Obama be a manifestation of change? He has basically continued the Clinton economic policies.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Tracks from \\"Funhouse\\" are still getting serious radio play a year and a half after the album's release.  More of its cuts will likely get to the Top Ten before it's run its course.  All a testimony to how strong the music and message(s) in the CD are.  And certainly a sign of how much Pink has progressed as an artist and in getting her voice and style under the public skin after years of being a \\"comer,\\" turning out consistently good music, even if less impactful than the terrific collection of songs on \\"Funhouse\\".  There's little doubt that this was a kind of therapy project for the artist.  There is so much emotion in the lyrics and such enormous feeling in Pink's deliveries--there's got to be a lot of personal angst driving it.  However she achieved it, this album is a tour de force that will morph into a classic and be heard for years to come.  I like the belted out power rock cuts and the softer, acoustical songs almost equally, and I'm hoping that at least lesser known tracks (\\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"Mean\\") get picked up for more radio play.<br /><br />Great CD that will lead me to by Pink's earlier recordings.

The methods laid out in this book will work if you stick to them. Nobody said starting something would be easy.

B000002HMH|3.0|I remember going to HMV (when they were still around) on the day this came out and listening to it on the headphones.  I'll never forget how disappointed I was.  I was 13 at the time, and the only Metallica I really knew was the Black album.  I can only imagine how veteran Metallica fans felt.  It seems to me that the people who disliked the Black album (even though it was in incredibly awesome album) fueled Metallica to make an album that they would REALLY hate.  It's actually really good music...but just not Metallica.  It's like if Lamborghini all of a sudden changed their cars to more of a Volvo style.  They're still great cars, but just not what you want.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline is a great story about discovery and consequences, and the 3-D works quite well--with a caveat.    There are two settings: \\"real world\\" and \\"other world\\" and when Coraline enters \\"other world\\" the 3-D can get a little overdone such that it is hard to adjust. But in some parts, even the true color (not the green and magenta images) doesn't track and can cause double images.    At the beginning, there is a doll that floats in from far away, and the 3-D is \\"wide\\" enough that the two images balk being resolved into 3-D. This happens regularly throughout the movie. Sometimes a tunnel that is stretching away will also stretch your eyes as you resolve the picture. It can be done if you are practiced with seeing \\"Magic Eye\\" images (this is a good site: [...]), but it can be a strain. I have had to stop and rewind or just pause and look at the scene again.    I am very practiced at the 3-D technique, as I have used 3-D machines to make contour maps from overlapping aerial photography pictures. My job required regular use of the 3-D technique employed in Magic Eye and 3-D movies.    Take the time to get acclimated to the 3-D vision by suffering through the ads. Also, if you can refrain from looking away from the screen--or obscuring your vision in either eye by up-ending a drink-- it will help preserve the 3-D effects. Stick a straw in your drink.    Fortunately, there is a 2-D version on the disk as well, and if you either can't see the 3-D or are tired of trying to resolve it, the movie is just as good in the 2-D version.    Coraline is very curious and brave in a movie that takes a bored and frustrated young girl on a journey into a fantasy world that entices--perhaps a little too much. Coraline is savvy and confident.  She uses her wits and pluck well to confront new situations and face danger head on. She stays true to herself and takes responsibility for her own actions and experiences. She's a great role model for children in my opinion.

B003GSTLAS|5.0|Walt is now in complete meltdown because his wife is having an affair with her boss. This couldn't be a worse choice on her part. Walt was barely holding onto himself before this admission. Now he is completely off the rails. He shows up at her office and tries to break into her boss's office, with her boss cowering behind the door. Another bad aspect to her newest choice of man is that her boss is in deep financial trouble and is cooking the books of the business. Walt is shown in further evidence of meltdown at the school, behind the wheel of his car, and in his \\"walking papers\\" talk with his principal.  This is so realistic (I practiced domestic relations law and his meltdown couldn't be truer to the real world daily enactment of how a party to domestic calamity reacts). The other characters keep apace with him in coming undone, especially the DEA brother-in-law, who is now deeply defying his superior.  He looks as if he is about to \\"go postal\\" at any second.

B003FSTN52|5.0|Update in late August 2010: It was just announced that Michael J. Fox is coming aboard for some episodes of this show's second season to play an attorney.  He recently won an Emmy for doing the same on RESCUE ME.  I am very excited about this as I think he will be a very good foil for these characters.  My original review follows.<br /><br />This show never ignores its central premise: what is it like being the wife of one of these political figures who gets involved in a lurid sex scandal.  Julia Marguiles does a very good job answering that question week in and week out.  Chris Noth plays her sex scandal husband.  Some viewers know him from SEX AND THE CITY while others know him from LAW & ORDER shows, both the original and CRIMINAL INTENT. He also does a very good job because you never like or trust him.  His role is getting meatier as the weeks go on and that is all to the good. I frankly would be tempted to just dump him in her place but she holds on for a variety of reasons, the most compelling being her two teen children who are already deeply conflicted by their father's behavior.  He starts out the season in prison and the action steps up when he is allowed to come home under house arrest, with an ankle bracelet. She is left as the main wage earner and she is a very good attorney in her own right. At her firm, she is surrounded by a partner, who is clearly smitten by her, another partner who is the reigning superwoman, and a woman private investigator for the firm, who is fast becoming one of the breakout stars from the series. I think this show is well worth your giving it a try.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307474275|4.0|A fun but somewhat typical thriller-mystery-page turner surrounding the big questions of who Jesus and Mary Magdalene really were, and what is the Holy Grail. The biggest problem for me was the fact that Dan Brown literally interwove facts with theories and fiction; I didn't know what was true or not, or even if the book itself was considered fiction or not. An example was when the author exclaims that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, and that the Roman Catholic Church tried to conceal this 'fact' by portraying Mary as a prostitute and Jesus as a virgin. Is this truly a fact, simply a theory, or a piece of fiction that Dan Brown is well aware of? Some of the author's claims I can just assume are incorrect, such as to what the Grail supposedly is, or that the person to the right of Jesus in Da Vinci's The Last Supper could be one of several people. But should a mystery book really make you constantly question the supposed given facts?<br /><br />The book is about the murder of the well known curator of the Louvre, who in his last moments alive creates a secret message to his granddaughter, Sophie Neveu and a Harvard professor of religious symbology, Robert Langdon. After solving the message, the two are brought on a trail of clues to where and what the Holy Grail is. The story also mixes together the big questions with, of course, the genius of Leonardo Da Vinci. Not only does it include some of  his paintings, but his famous drawing, The Vitruvian Man, and his 'supposed' never finished invention called the cryptex, a portable vault. Being interested in Da Vinci, I really like the concept of a mystery that includes his work. Dan Brown adds a side of romance as revealed at the end. I couldn't help but think that ever since the Harvard professor described Sophie as attractive, the two of them ending up dating was completely inevitable. As for the mystery of who \\"The Teacher\\" was, towards the end it became clear that there were only so many options for his identity to be climatic, despite the clues that had threw me off, kind of like a Scooby Doo episode. The real mystery of the book is of course the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book. Despite it's flaws, It is a fun, fairly simple read. As almost anyone who has read it will tell you, it is hard to stop reading; It seemed like there was always a compelling mystery on the verge of being solved just as I wanted to put the book down. The ending is satisfying enough, something that you would definitely hope for after such a treasure hunt. The whole concept of the 'truth' of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is very interesting plot compared to a typical mystery, the book's enigma is based around a huge and puzzling question. In addition, Dan Brown incorporates pieces of Da Vinci's work, making the story even more interesting. But as absorbing as the book is, it seemed like a lot of what I was fascinated from it was fiction.  Overall, I'd give the book a three and a half out of five, as in a seven out of ten.<br /><br />Ray Mullinimatic, despite the clues that had threw me off, kind of like a Scooby Doo episode.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|This movie continues the reversial of mr. Eastwood's image while providing   evidence of his shedding further his limited range acting approach.  With few exceptions, his growing, he presents a well rounded protrayal of a bitter, intelligent 70+ ageing male bonded to a almost vanished era and tradition.  His rediscovery of his humanity and ability to extend and expand his personility and beliefs and bigotity is done exceeding well. Eastwoods direction again exceeds his acting, although this timethe spread is narrower. Well worth seeing and definately a \\"Dirthy Harry 5\\"
1597801577|5.0|Bacigalupi is one of the most promising science fiction writers of the last decade (along with Cory Doctorow). Exquisitely rendered, tightly plotted, with compelling and textured characters ... a real treat to read. Highly recommended.    For those upset with the \\"groundedness\\" of the science, please - take a deep breath. Bacigalupi has posited a future - not necessarily one you believe, but a future nonetheless, in which the main, acceptable mobile power in Thailand is somatic energy, stored as mechanical energy. He's not writing a user manual, he's writing about biopiracy and biofascism.    It's a metaphor. Get it?
B000GW8OXC|5.0|Vinyl is sparking a flame as of late, many choose it because they claim they can truly hear the difference (when in reality lets be honest many people snag it for the looks and credibility). I agree vinyl can sound amazing, modern releases from artist though are usually compromised due to the lacking rough source (and no it's not always because it's always digital). Rest assure this is one set that the difference isn't just packaging. Steve Hoffman was behind the vinyl pressing, he's one of the few people I truly trust when it comes to revitalizing the sound of an album.<br /><br />Pressed at RTI by Rick Hashimoto, all four 180 gram slabs of vinyl sound fuller, warmer, and dynamically alive. Between Warner Bros. commitment to keeping it all analog and (thankfully) passing these masters over to Kevin Gray and Steve Hoffman you come out ahead. When \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" was released in May of 06', Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante spoke highly of all the effects and techniques he had incorporated. We heard his playing style really evolve, spiced with vintage rock riffs (tones too), and waves of forgotten 80's artist. This was the ultimate thank you to fans, twenty eight tracks, singles and experimental tunes as plentiful as the number of days, weeks, months and years we've awaited for this release ( what a long four years).<br /><br />Chad Smith blasted us away with unique drum solos, Anthony tested his vocal range, and Flea was still bouncing off the bass of 2002's \\"By The Way\\". It all seemed so perfect, then the moment of truth... Going home looking at the funky packaging, 'Mars' and 'Jupiter' some spacey attempt to cohesively bond the two discs instead of coming out in the open with 'disc one' and 'disc two'. It seemed like things were going smooth, and they did to many of us for the first few weeks, until we noticed the definite lack in something. That something turned out to be the dynamics, missing in action and we were fed a lot of chunky cleans, lifeless drum chatter (Chad did a great job, I'm just trying to make a point of the actual sound quality) and a look to the past. Anyone remember RHCP's \\"Californication\\"? Of course, how about all the sharp jabs at Rick Rubin and co? Claiming the album was too compressed for its own good, many picked up on this much later in the game with 2008's \\"Death magnetic\\" by Metallica.<br /><br />Instead of dwelling on the past, and the digital copy of \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" lets look at the pros of the vinyl edition. You get more headroom, the dynamics have made a return. Ambience submissively takes the back seat, in the good sense of course. Tracks like \\"Slow Cheetah\\" flow, and make the way to the top of your playlist. What you could have labeled filler in the past may now be not nearly as fatiguing and actually quite enjoyable. Singles sound fresher, the album lasts longer, if only vinyl was gum. Uplifting tunes express themselves now, calmer songs like \\"Wet Sand\\" and \\"Hard to Concentrate\\" are much easier to appreciate etc. \\"Turn It Again\\" and \\"Readymade\\" burst at the seams with energy without ever being so repulsively compressed you turn down the volume.<br /><br />2006 for many fans wasn't a good year, criticizing the album at any given chance, the production value was instantly a cheap shot. Given this copy there probably wouldn't be a reason to complain, still a 'hot' mix it's not nearly as scorching. Some will find a way to poke fun at Anthony Kiedis and his bizarre wording, or the Chili Peppers being less funky then former releases. This has a little bit for everybody familiar with there 90's work and above (\\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" tunes sorry).<br /><br />For those not familiar with vinyl and would to snag a copy of this, do note there are two separate version floating amongst sellers. They both come with four records, you get all twenty eight tracks no worries there. One edition is on 150 gram vinyl, pretty standard stuff, but again it doesn't sound bad. For those willing to throw more money at the deal, you can get the 180 gram version (heavier, thicker vinyl usually saved for audiophile recordings, doesn't seem to be the case as of recently). This box set includes a 'deluxe' slipcase, combined with a special booklet.ou can get the 180 gram version (heavier, thicker vinyl usually saved for audiophile recordings, doesn't seem to be the case as of recently).

0061914177|5.0|As the title of my review says, I'm writing this because Gary asked me to!<br />He has built up such a loyal following over the past few years that even your humble reviewer, living over 3000 miles away, only having seen WLTV a couple of times because (i) I don't drink a lot of wine and (ii) it's a bit far to travel to get the stuff he reviews, felt moved by his plea to review Crush IT! as there had been some 'hater' reviews.<br />Now I know this sounds a bit sad but it's because the book really is excellent. You can ignore the parts about his childhood if you need to (as reserved Brits we tend not to identify with Gary's brand of brashness) and skip directly to the social media marketing parts. The book is gold dust, part inspiration, part how to manual. I have already bought one for a friend and intend to get more in the future. This is Seth Godin on speed. Highly recommended.

B0029LHW68|5.0|When I first heard that 30 STM had come out with a new album I was a little wary. How do you follow something as epically, soul-wrenchingly beautiful as A Beautiful Lie?  If you're looking for something like that, you won't like this; however, if you ask me, this album proves that 30 STM is still growing and maturing as a band, and this most definitely a positive step for them. While not quite as \\"rock your socks off\\" as some of their past albums, This is War is an absolutely gorgeous album. I love every song on it :)  So, keep in mind: yes, this album is different than their past ones. But yes, it's still 30 STM, so it's still amazing.

B0035V35P8|4.0|As of late we have been lacking higher budget Ninja/Samurai/Martial Arts films. There was a sudden boom a couple years ago when [[ASIN:B0007Q6VXC House of Flying Daggers]], [[ASIN:B000MRA592 Curse of the Golden Flower]], [[ASIN:B00030590I Hero]] and many other great titles kept coming out. I love good Martial Arts movies whether it be due to great acting, superb visuals or simply intense action a good martial arts movie is always my first choice. Ninja Assassin is more of the later, non stop action, chaotic fighting and quite a lot of gore.<br /><br />The acting is decent in the current time parts but is excellent in the flashback's. The kid's do a great job making the viewer feel the extreme punishment that comes with the rigorous training of a Ninja. The plot moves quickly as to not stunt the excitement of each battle. It is the battles where this movie shines however. Extremely stylized and very unrealistic the fighting in NA comes off as brutal with a to-the-death feel as if you expect the main protagonist to die at any moment. The Ninja's come off as creatures more so then men and the quiet whispering in the shadow's was an eerie touch just before they attacked.<br /><br />All in all the plot was rather predictable but the insane action and chaotic fighting kept my interest. Watch it and decide for yourself but if your one whom requires intellectual dialog and a very tight and expertly crafted plot this movie is definitely not for you. This is one of those flicks you throw on after you've seen all the rest of your movies to many times for cheap thrills. Still some of the best fighting scenes I have seen in a long time and though it may fail in comparison to the previously mention Martial Arts movies, it is decent filler til the next excellent release comes out.

1400063736|2.0|I purchased this book because of the accolades and wonderful reviews it had received.  After finishing the book, I have to admit I'm wondering if I was reading the same book as those that lauded it so highly.<br /><br />I did like the beginning of the book when it was centered in Ireland, but not long after that I began to lose interest.  There was very little intersection of characters throughout the book and what little there was wasn't enough to get me excited.<br /><br />Yes, there is a bit (just a bit) of a tie-in to some of the more \\"distant\\" characters at the end of the book, but it surely wasn't worth the effort to get to that point.<br /><br />The most touching chapter, in my opinion, was \\"Centavos\\"...and it was, by far, the shortest chapter in the book.  (If you've decided not to read the book, it's worth going to the bookstore and just reading this chapter.  It's a lovely, sentimental and touching remembrance of a just-lost love.)<br /><br />I hate when a book disappoints like this one did.

I downloaded some tracks from amazon's mp3 store before deciding to buy the CD-- if you have a pretty high quality stereo, I recommend it. The difference is there.    Also, I tried to find some info out about where they recorded it and the synths used-- I think I hear and SID synth in there, is that right? Such a great mix of sounds.
1595141979|2.0|In the third book of the Vampire Academy series, [[ASIN:1595141979 Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy, Book 3)]], the students of St. Vlad's have returned to campus after the harrowing events of holiday break.  Rose, fresh from her first Strigoi kill and the loss of a good friend, is feeling distracted and volatile.  As trials for the novice guardians are underway, Rose starts seeing a possible ghost and Lissa begins experimenting more and more with her spirit magic.  As her relationship with Dimitri intensifies, the actions of a rogue student group put everyone in danger and Rose must decide what to do.<br /><br />Compared to the first two books, SHADOW KISS does better with developing the nuances of the relationship between Rose and Lissa; the expansion of the shadow-kissed mythology adds dimension to their connection.  Lissa also grows in her leadership position and confidence, and the story directly addresses the aftermath of the Strigoi attack and Mason's death on Rose.  The continued presence of Adrian adds humor and guile to the story, and I finally felt a connection between Rose and Dimitri near the end.  The second half of the book has a very quick and tension-filled plot; I felt genuinely concerned for the characters and the outcome, even if it was predictable.  The book also had less repetition than FROSTBITE, and the dated references found in the second book were absent.<br /><br />On the downside, the overall pacing was off, with the first half very slow before the action of the second half.  Though there was some character development, the story was driven by the plot, not the development of its characters.  Rose's character came across as very immature and irritating in the first half of the book (even though the reason was explained later), and again, it was difficult to understand Dimitri's attraction to Rose, especially after her behavior.  The outcome at the end of the book was very sad, but it was also very predictable.  Mead continued her trend of telling, instead of showing, and there was at least one significant continuity error in Rose's narration.<br /><br />With all of these combined, I did not enjoy SHADOW KISS as much as the first two books in the series.  Nonetheless, with the fascinating world that Mead has built for her characters, I know I will keep reading each new book.  However, I hope that [[ASIN:1595143106 Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, Book 4)]] and the books to come will have less predictability and more character development.of showing, and there was at least one significant continuity error in Rose's narration.

B002KAO23E|5.0|This is a lovely story.  All of Mrs. Austen's books are great classics.  I didn't find anything wrong with the format or TOC.  Easy to follow.
B002VECMAE|2.0|I saw reviews from baby boomers and reviews from the younger generation who all loved it; maybe being stuck in the middle explains my dislike.<br /><br />I waited with much anticipation for the release of [[ASIN:B002VECMAE The Men Who Stare At Goats]], but it was all for nothing.<br /><br />While the acting was okay, it just wasn't up to par as is expected for Jeff Bridges or George Clooney.  However, it's difficult when the story line is, well, boring.<br /><br />I forced myself to watch over half of this movie before just giving up.  And I love movies!<br /><br />But this one, sadly, just didn't cut for me.

0061914177|5.0|I work in an office as a sales coordinator for a pretty large manufacturer - that aside, my dream is to start my own tuning shop for track day and autox cars.....My point??? Gary's book gave me the drive and basic idea to embrace my passion, to let what I do speak for itself and to get out into social media and spread my knowledge amongst those who need it! Why???? It will help me gain a customer base for the one off parts and skill set I have with a particular chassis in the tuning world. A month after reading it, I have a functioning blog and an active business page on Facebook - I HAVE ORDERS FOR MY SERVICES!!!!!!! Something to do on the side right now, but if I keep at it and grow a large enough customer base - who knows! Thanks Gary for giving me a little drive and knowledge!!!!    This is how I interpreted his book, it works if you apply it - Very inspiring, very knowledgeable......all around a great read and a great source of reference - anyone who says otherwise couldn't have opened their mind enough to what Mr. Vay-ner-chuk has to say. Get a copy, read it, use his ideas and spin your own off of it-or copy his, he doesn't care-IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO NOT READ THIS BOOK..........no excuses.
B000003TAL|3.0|Tonight is my first exposure to any Sonic Youth album.      My interest in wanting to discover this band first came six years ago when playing an old Playstation game called Silent Hill (released in 1999).  Supposedly there's some references to this band in that game.      Now, while I was going to school in the late 90's, I don't recall anyone mentioning this band at all.  I suppose maybe this was due to the band not being popular enough back then, and therefore didn't catch on and simply couldn't be cited as a major influence to the alternative rock and the hardcoe punk genre.      Perhaps just living in a small town all my life made Sonic Youth unknown among everyone I went to school with.    Either way, it's nice this band is getting some recognition these days.  I'm personally not a huge fan of their songwriting, but influence is influence, and this is simply something that *cannot* be denied.    Anyway, after further exploring other bands on the internet, I discovered a few message boards with people I trust (trust enough for music recommendations I mean- hey, this *is* the internet after all).    For years however, I ignored the determination of these posters.  They tried extremely *hard* to get me to check out Sonic Youth, and I just kept putting it off time and time again.  I guess I figured I like the Pixies, and there's no way Sonic Youth can live up to that bands standards of songwriting... and my gut feeling turned out to be true (for the most part).    This album is definitely different from other late 80's albums, I'll give it credit for that (a TON of credit actually).  I don't like the songwriting like I mention above, but at least this album stands apart from the pack.  Except for maybe the Pixies, I can't think of another band that sounded anything like this back in the late 80's.    \\"Teen Age Riot\\" is definitely weird.  Maybe I just can't get into it, but it feels like the vocals are quite repetitive.  \\"Silver Rocket\\" sounds like an attempt to recapture the glory days of the Stooges, but misses the mark completely as far as raw energy is concerned.  It's too smooth and, to be honest, it DOES sound commercial (even though technically it's not).    I can't say I've ever heard vocals lines like the ones featured on \\"The Sprawl\\".  They repeat a lot, but they *work* so I enjoy them.  \\"Cross the Breeze\\" has some really good guitar playing, and maybe this is just a coincidence but certain parts of the guitar work remind me of the old German experimental rock band Can.      \\"Eric's Trip\\" is quite strange and possibly a song that might grow on me more one day, \\"Total Trash\\" has a decent melody, \\"Hey Joni\\" actually DOES sound like something from the late 80's (such as the Smiths perhaps, but not a WHOLE lot), \\"Providence\\" is just flat out strange (in an appealing way) and \\"Candle\\" is pretty good.     I have a hard time describing these songs because the album isn't really THAT diverse.   It would take me several more listens to separate each one of them.      I will say this though- while the songwriting doesn't blow me away, I can see this album growing on me in the future.  If it does, the rating will go up to a 4 out of 5.      Sonic Youth doesn't leave me speechless like so many of the creative and diverse bands before them, but they hold their own and dish out some quality songs from time to time, and their influence is without a doubt the major reason they should be remembered.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|First of all , this was a great surprise for me when announced by Slash , after VR took a break two years ago :)<br />So here is it , plain and simple , yet complex and fresh<br /><br />Track by track<br /><br />1.Ghost (Feat. Ian Astbury) - Great starter for such an album with a cool riff opening up and continuing throughout the song!<br />Izzy Stradlin is playing rhythm on this one :)<br />Glad he's chosen to work with Slash again officially !<br /><br />2.Crucify The Dead (Feat. Ozzy Osbourne) - Best song on the album<br />Why ? Listen to the lyrics carefully ! &lt;semi-spoiler> - because it's towards Slash's past and we all know what happened a few years ago ...<br />Ozzy means quality in rock music so , why argue anyway :D<br /><br />3.Beautiful Dangerous (Feat. Fergie)<br />Great tune with memorable Slash licks<br />I wonder how would people react to a Black Eyed Peas disbanding cuz of Fergie joining Velvet Revolver ? Hmm :)<br /><br />4.Back From Cali (Feat. Myles Kennedy) - Myles is a new-comer for my musical knowledge but a pleasant surprise.<br />Can't wait to see him live this summer on Slash's tour !<br />The song is a great sing-along , that's for sure.<br /><br />5.Promise (Feat. Chris Cornell) - One of the greatest riffs / licks to be featured on the album.<br /><br />6.By The Sword (Feat. Andrew Stockdale) - Great pick for a first single , from what i've read / heard.<br />Andrew Stockdale is a great singer anyway !<br /><br />7.Gotten (Feat. Adam Levine) - Maroon 5-ish sound with Slash's lick & solo around :)<br /><br />8.Doctor Alibi (Feat. Lemmy Kilmeister) - Motorhead trademark !<br />Great track , enjoyable solo !<br /><br />9.Watch This (Feat. Dave Grohl/Duff McKagan) - Pure rock n' roll instrumental track , hope they play it live !<br /><br />10.I Hold On (Feat. Kid Rock) - Wow , another hit on this album , Kid Rock really shines on this one. Great lyrics too !<br /><br />11.Nothing To Say (Feat. M Shadows) - Another new musical personality for my taste,but again a nice surprise ! Power-track with a metal feel ! Solo and licks are over-the-top !<br /><br />12.Starlight (Feat. Myles Kennedy) - Totally enjoyable , hard to describe !<br /><br />13.Saint Is A Sinner Too (Feat. Rocco DeLuca) - 2nd best song on this album ... totally different from the other tunes on the album , which is cool and points out Slash's musical range<br />Catchy lyrics too !<br /><br />14.We're All Gonna Die (Feat. Iggy Pop) - Like Iggy said in the Album Trailer - it's rock song !<br />Headbanging vibe :)<br /><br />-----------<br />I'll also mention these , because they are worth-mentioning !<br />Extra-tracks (to be found on the UK release)<br /><br />1.Sahara (Feat.Koshi Inaba) - Incredible track,this should have been on the album,worldwide-ish, not UK-only :)<br />This is the english version of the song,although that doesn't really matter,the vibe of the song & the licks/riffs are incredible<br />Solo - no comment :)<br />2.Baby Can't Drive (Feat. Alice Cooper & Nicole Scherzinger)<br />Pleasant surprise by Alice & Nicole, i don't know the story of the song,why it wasn't included on the initial album as well.<br /><br />3.Paradise City (Feat. Fergie & Cypress Hill) - i was ultra-happy they Slash did this,because it's a really different version compared to the Appetite version !<br />The \\"so far away\\" riff is missing though , but we can live with that , can't we ?<br />I know certain people will be bashing this comment , but this version is much better than whatever new Gn'R is out performing live this time around :)<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />I won't make any tops / pros / cons for this, but it's definitely a record to have & to listen to it as many times as possible.<br />Make no mistake,this is not Appetite or Snakepit , it would be impossible to get to that - it's got a dozen guest vocalists on it :) - but it's totally R'n'f'Roll and a great album !

0061914177|5.0|\\"Crush It\\" was some of my first real exposure to the concept of using social networking as a commercial venture. I have always used it purely as a social vehicle. After Reading Gary's explanation of all the different avenues of using the various platforms I have began to get creative and adventurous in my approach to social networking for monetized value. I loved his perspective of keeping family first that speaks to my own value in this area. However, I have to say I am not a patient type and so the section on patients was discouraging. Thanks for the simple step by step approach!!!
B002GTZSZU|5.0|This is a great movie and with the Director's cut you can pick up more of the story...
B002ZFQD04|3.0|The Sticky and Sweet tour is the third Madonna tour I have seen in person and the third that I own on DVD.  While the show was entertaining and no other performer comes close to Madonna on stage, this was not quite the Madonna spectacle that I had come to expect.  High points: She's Not Me performance, great new versions of Vogue, Music, Borderline, Into the Groove and Like a Prayer, overall nice balance of old and new hits.  Low Points: Weak entrance (hard to top the giant disco ball from the Confessions Tour), \\"rock\\" version of Borderline is not on the CD that accompanies the DVD, weak choreography (nothing we haven't seen before), overall production/editing is not as slick as for the Confessions Tour.  For an even sweeter Madonna experience, purchase and view the Confessions Tour.
B001I45UFC|5.0|How much do I love this book.  I recently revisited it and had the experience of reading it out loud to my nephew (7) and niece (5).  I hadn't read it for quite a few years and, although I still know the story well, there were parts of the book that had faded with the passing of time  and were brought back to life with the re-reading of the book, as tends to happen.<br /><br />For instance - I'd completely forgotten the feeling of complete joy and wonder when Aslan bounds over the wall of the Queen's courtyard and begins to breathe life back into the statues there.  I'd forgotten good old Rumblebuffin and how much he made me laugh.  I'd forgotten that, in spite of what the movies do, the battle scene was fleeting and over so quickly because the focus of this book is not on the grim trials of war but rather on the redemption of the living creatures spoken of.<br /><br />While reading through the story and watching my niece and nephew sink into despair at Aslan's death I felt again the pang of sorrow I felt as a child.  After we'd finished the chapter my nephew looked at the title of the next, being \\"The Triumph of the Witch\\" and he gasped in shock.  \\"But, she doesn't win.. does she, Aunt?\\" he asked.<br /><br />He learned quickly that in spite of her best efforts.. in this beautiful, wonderful story.. of course evil does not win.  If you haven't read this book in a while I invite you to re-visit it.  Reading it out loud, savoring it chapter by chapter was one of the most amazing parts of each of my days.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best representations of the Allosaurus ever to be made.  With great attention to detail and affording the figure with the option to open or close the mouth, makes this a wonderful piece for display purposes.  I would recommend this A+ figurine for scientific museum quality purposes.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|good to have as a final addition to the others MJ pieces that I have.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|As a fan of the original series Star Trek cast and characters I would like to go up to JJ Abrams, get in his face, and say \\"What were you thinking?!?\\" in my best drill sergeant voice.  This new Star Trek movie has gone so far off the reservation in terms of characters and story that I'm not sure it's even on the MAP any more.  I mean, I love watching Trek in any form, but Spock getting all whiny and emo when he loses his mother??  That is too much to stomach.<br /><br />As someone who likes a good popcorn flick with lots of action and explosions, however, I have to confess that I did like this one, because it has plenty of those.  Also, Chris Hemsworth did an admirable job as George Kirk, James T's dad, and Karl Urban absolutely nailed the part of McCoy.  I think that if DeForest Kelley had lived to see this movie, he would have loved Urban's performance even if he hated the rest of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, an okay movie, but with too many plot complications and holes to satisfy the old-guard Trek fans.  I would recommend it to those who are just getting into Trek with a strong admonition to watch the original series episodes ASAP so they know what Trek is REALLY supposed to be all about.
B002ZG983M|4.0|New York, The Present: Dave Lizewski is, by his own admission, a non-descript kind of teenager who drifts from one unremarkable day of high-school to the next. He spends his days fixating on his English teacher's breasts, reading comic books, hanging out at the local comic store with his equally feckless friends and wasting far too much time on social networking sites on the internet. It is this life of unremitting banality - as well as his own inherent naivety - that leads him to don a green and yellow diving suit and mask and attempt to live the life of a superhero. However, as Dave is about to find out, trying to dispense comic book justice and cookie-cutter morality on the streets of a mob-town like New York can be a very dangerous idea indeed...     Matthew Vaughn's \\"Kick Ass\\" is a glorious satire of the notions of super-heroism, vigilantism, fanboy culture and Gen Y's obsession with spectacle and hyper-reality; I also suspect that is probably a very faithful adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book (and whilst I haven't read this particular book myself, I am familiar enough with the rest of Millar's work to recognise the pertinent hallmarks of lunatic genius that have made the mad Scotsman a \\"force majeure\\" in the comic book industry) given that it is violent, foul-mouthed, disturbing and amusing in equal measures (and on a number of different levels) and it is, for the most part, whip-smart. As a screen outing, its also a far more satisfying depiction of Millar's obsessions than the awful \\"Wanted\\" movie (a film which took an amoral tale told amorally and attempted to sanitise it for the screen).     I can't really go into too many details of the plot without ruining this film but all I will say this: if you're sick of the nauseating pontification that gets shoe-horned into most modern American action cinema, then this will be right up your alley because its a glorious fart in the face of conventional cinematic wisdom and morality. Parents should be warned though that despite being tangentially about superheroes, this film is emphatically NOT suitable for children. Don't let the shiny costumes fool you. It is an adult fairy tale with a pronounced accent on the \\"adult\\".     For the record, my partner and I generally despise Superheroes and Superhero movies on the grounds that most of them are nauseatingly smug morality plays which have no basis in reality - that was not the case with this film. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it left us wanting to adopt a \\"Hit-Girl\\" of our very own.
0780619951|3.0|The Island of Dr. Moreau was based on an H.G. Wells novel written exactly five score (100) years before this 1996 version, which was the third attempt at capturing the novel on film. 1932's Island of Lost Souls, the first version, was a haunting film. Though in Black & White and made with much cruder special effects and make up, it nevertheless was the most successful in creating its macabre mood. Charles Loughton played the mad doctor and none other than Bela Lugosi was the Sayer of the Law. With Lost Souls indelibly etched in my brain the 1977 version, also called The Island of Dr. Moreau, seemed rather mediocre in comparison, in spite of featuring Burt Lancaster, Michael York, and Richard Basehart. It would be interesting to compare '77 instead with this version made less than one score years later, which easily made the list of The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE® MOVIE GUIDE.<br /><br />Richard Stanley, the original director, was fired by the studio after only a few days. Val Kilmer announced that he wanted nothing to do with the project, but was forced to fulfill his contractual obligations. He was supposed to play the lead, but took the role of Dr. Montgomery instead. David Thewlis was cast, and strangely, he had been the original choice for the part from fired director Richard Stanley. Among other mishaps, Thewlis broke his leg during the shoot when he fell off a horse. David Thewlis had such a horrible time that he refused to attend the premiere, and vowed he would never watch the film.<br /><br />--------------<br />Dr. Moreau: I have almost achieved perfection you see, of a divine creature that is pure, harmonious, absolutely incapable of any malice. And if in my tinkering I have fallen short of the human form by the snout, claw or hoof, it really is of no great importance. I am closer than you could possibly imagine, sir.<br />====================<br /><br />The cast embarked on their doomed journey with high hopes. Val Kilmer vacationed with Brando in Ireland just prior to filming. Ron Perlman signed on mainly for a chance to work with the great Marlon Brando. But Brando gave such a silly and sissified performance that it made his controversially prissy Mr. Christian in Mutiny On The Bounty seem butch.<br /><br />To be fair, Brando was dealing with his daughter's recent suicide, and the French had just conducted an underwater nuclear detonation near Tahiti and one of the atolls that Brando owned; but could even that excuse a performance this bad from the master thespian, who not only \\"coulda been a contender\\" but had been the holder of the heavy weight acting crown?<br /><br />The role of Dr. Moreau did call for a brilliant but eccentric man who isolated himself on an island, with servants and underlings who catered to his every whim, and that would seem to be right up Brando's atoll, but the affect was comical, not tragic or dramatic, or, as befits a horror film, horrifying. The only thing frightening about his performance was how bad it was. Perhaps Marlon was going for White Plantation Owner, or, Would-Be Pope, playing God, but the resultant mixed metaphors had Brando being carted around in a throne; face painted white with sunscreen, an umbrella on his head, clutching a remote control/rosary that dished out the pain to stray members of his manimal flock. What should have been a climactic scene where he confronts Hyena-Swine and the others who have removed their pain inflicting implants was in danger of seeming more like a routine fight over the TV's remote. Another scene where Dr. Moreau plays the grand piano while a similarly attired Majai (the diminutive Nelson de la Rosa) plays atop the grand on a baby grand of his own was no doubt the inspiration for Dr. Evil's Mini-Me in Mike Myers' Austin Powers films.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Edward Douglas: Are you a doctor?<br />Montgomery: Well, I'm more of a vet.<br/>==========================================<br /><br />Val Kilmer was dealing with demons of his own. Though he was initially enthusiastic about working with Brando he became disillusioned when he saw that his idol had feet of clay. He learned that his then wife, Johanna Whalley, was divorcing him when he saw it on TV. Being served with divorce papers, and dissatisfied with the direction the project was taking, he wanted out desperately. With his recent success playing Batman he was too valuable a commodity for the studio to release him completely, so he switched to the lesser role of Dr. Montgomery. Perhaps he felt a certain kinship with the brilliant neurosurgeon reduced to the role of shepherd for Dr. Moreau's flock of misbegotten manimals? Whatever his mood, he seemed to be either deliberately sabotaging the film, having a laugh at a private joke, or more likely, he just did not care. He plays a drug freak-out scene that is so Oliver Stoned that it would be laughed OUT of a Cheech and Chong movie, let alone The Doors (which was, in my opinion, a great film with a great performance by Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, even if the surviving members of The Doors disliked it). This scene culminates in Dr. Montgomery seeming to have caught Dr. Moreau's contagious insanity, but it seems more like Kilmer is cruelly mocking Brando, biting the hand that fed him.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Hyena-Swine: There is no pain, there is no law!<br />=====================================<br /><br />When Director Richard Stanley was summarily fired after only a few days, it is fitting that John Frankenheimer was tapped to direct this Frankenstein monster of a movie. In the early 60's he directed The Manchurian Candidate, The Birdman of Alcatraz, All Fall Down, and The Young Savages; but by 1987, however, he had directed Riviera, a made-for-television movie that turned out so bad that it was attributed to Alan Smithee, the appellation affixed to films to escape blame when the director wants nothing further to do with it. Perhaps he should have blamed The Island of Dr. Moreau on Alan Smithee, too?<br /><br />From the start he was at odds with Brando, Kilmer, and the studio executives. The original shooting script by Richard Stanley was tossed, barely two words survived; but due to WGA (Writer's Guild of America) rules, Richard Stanley retained co-writer credit. Walon Green was a bit luckier and avoided any blame when he provided uncredited contributions to Hutchinson's draft. Ron Hutchinson's rewrites incorporated changes ordered by Frankenheimer, Brando, Kilmer and the studio. Frankenheimer wanted to alter the basic tone of the film and attempted to merge Brando's vision of Moreau with his version. Big mistake. Brando, though a great actor, needs a strong director to rein him in. Or at the very least someone who knows how to use his unique stage presence--like Francis Ford Copolla did in The Godfather or Apocalypse Now. Or Bernardo Bertolucci's in Ultimo tango a Parigi. 'Island' turned out as bad as the disaster that was 1961's One-Eyed Jacks, where Brando fired Director Stanley Kubrick and directed it himself.<br /><br />--------------<br />Hyena-Swine: Fine man... please... tell them... that I am God.<br />Edward Douglas: You all killed the Father. You all ate his flesh. So who is the new Father? Who is God Number One? Who should they obey?<br />[indicating other rebellious Beast People]<br />Edward Douglas: Him? Him. You see, there must be a God Number One.<br />[Hyena-Swine roars and shoots at his compatriots]<br />==========================<br /><br />Perhaps the strangest story associated with this production was that fired director Richard Stanley sneaked back onto the set in a dog mask and performed as an extra. Though uncredited, he is seen as a melting bulldog. He kept up the charade until the wrap party. Hearing this, one can only wonder, what might have been had his directorial services been retained? He obviously had an interest in the outcome of the project, and it would seem to be a perfect fit for his talents. The South African from the town of Fishhook had made two films previously that overcame many obstacles to become cult films, namely Hardware and Dust Devil. \\"I do not feel that at any time it was ever my decision to make any of the movies I made,\\" said Richard Stanley, \\"although I don't regret them.\\"<br /><br />--------------<br />Sayer of the Law: It is a hard way, the way of being a man. Sooner or later we all want a thing that is bad. To walk on all fours. To suck up drink from a stream. To jabber, instead of saying the words. To go snuffling at the earth, and to claw on the bark of trees. To eat flesh, or fish. To make love to more than one, every which way. These are all bad things. These are not the things that men do. But we are men, are we not? We are men because the Father has made us men!<br />=====================<br /><br />Though I have already spent the bulk of this review deriding the 3-car chain collision of Frankenheimer, Kilmer, and Brando, I have to say that in spite of it all, the manimals were often very good. Stan Winston is a man whose name often comes up in regards to creating creatures and special effects, and off the top of my head, I've noticed he's also done great work on AI: Artificial Intelligence and the recent 3D remake of Clash of The Titans. With Winston's help the actors under the heavy make up emoted in most cases much better than the ostensible stars. Daniel Rigney as Hyena-Swine was surprisingly poignant, bewildered to be caught between man's reason and animal's instinct, expressing his inchoate rage with words interspersed with yowls, yips, growls, and hyena laughs. Mark Dacascos as tiger-man Lo-Mai was as frightening and enigmatic as the Beast in poet Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bête. Ron Perlman was fully committed to his role, and went as far as having discs placed over his eyes since The Sayer of The Law was blind. The d&eacute;nouement with the inevitable manimal rebellion went much better than would be expected, given the mess that preceded it. The falcon cannot hear the falconer; things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. In an earlier scene in Dr. Moreau's mansion there was something fitting in (Marco Hofschneider) M'ling's choice and reading of The Second Coming, by William Butler Yeats:<br /><br />--------------<br />And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br />~William Butler Yeats from The Second Coming<br />=======================<br /><br />[[ASIN:6302843200 Island of Lost Souls [VHS]]] (1932) This version starred Charles Loughton and Bela Lugosi<br />[[ASIN:B0000DC14V One-Eyed Jacks]] (1961) Directed by and starring Marlon Brando as Rio<br />[[ASIN:B00011D1OK Mutiny on the Bounty]] (1962) Marlon Brando was 1st Lt.

[Hyena-Swine roars and shoots at his compatriots]  ==========================     Perhaps the strangest story associated with this production was that fired director Richard Stanley sneaked back onto the set in a dog mask and performed as an extra. Though uncredited, he is seen as a melting bulldog. He kept up the charade until the wrap party. Hearing this, one can only wonder, what might have been had his directorial services been retained? He obviously had an interest in the outcome of the project, and it would seem to be a perfect fit for his talents. The South African from the town of Fishhook had made two films previously that overcame many obstacles to become cult films, namely Hardware and Dust Devil. \\"I do not feel that at any time it was ever my decision to make any of the movies I made,\\" said Richard Stanley, \\"although I don't regret them.\\"    --------------  Sayer of the Law: It is a hard way, the way of being a man. Sooner or later we all want a thing that is bad. To walk on all fours. To suck up drink from a stream. To jabber, instead of saying the words. To go snuffling at the earth, and to claw on the bark of trees. To eat flesh, or fish. To make love to more than one, every which way. These are all bad things. These are not the things that men do. But we are men, are we not? We are men because the Father has made us men!   =====================    Though I have already spent the bulk of this review deriding the 3-car chain collision of Frankenheimer, Kilmer, and Brando, I have to say that in spite of it all, the manimals were often very good. Stan Winston is a man whose name often comes up in regards to creating creatures and special effects, and off the top of my head, I've noticed he's also done great work on AI: Artificial Intelligence and the recent 3D remake of Clash of The Titans. With Winston's help the actors under the heavy make up emoted in most cases much better than the ostensible stars. Daniel Rigney as Hyena-Swine was surprisingly poignant, bewildered to be caught between man's reason and animal's instinct, expressing his inchoate rage with words interspersed with yowls, yips, growls, and hyena laughs. Mark Dacascos as tiger-man Lo-Mai was as frightening and enigmatic as the Beast in poet Jean Cocteau's La belle et la bête. Ron Perlman was fully committed to his role, and went as far as having discs placed over his eyes since The Sayer of The Law was blind. The dénouement with the inevitable manimal rebellion went much better than would be expected, given the mess that preceded it. The falcon cannot hear the falconer; thingsfall apart; the centre cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|East Germany, 1984: Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a career policeman in the German Democratic Republic's notorious Stasi; frighteningly well-skilled in the methods of interrogation and surveillance, Gerd is tasked by his department head with the job of bugging, electronically surveiling  and collecting evidence against Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a popular playwright whose glowing  socialist polemics are unilaterally favoured by the party. During the course of his surveillance, Gerd comes to realise that it is in fact a senior party member's envy of Johan's relationship with actress Christa-Maria Sealand (Martina Gedeck), rather than any seditious behaviour on his own part, that has led to Johan being earmarked as a dissident. Quietly incensed by this corruption of socialist ideals and state mechanisms, and touched by the depth warmth, depth and vulnerability of Georg and Christa-Maria's relationship (which only serves to underline his own inherent sense of loneliness), Gerd begins to consider a quiet act of rebellion. But what chance of success can he truly hope to have given that he exists in a world in which even the watchmen are watched?      The \\"lonely man\\" genre of film is one that has been well-mined in cinema, but never to such devastating emotional effect as it is in \\"The Lives Of Others\\". Sure, you felt sorry for Gene Hackman and Robin Williams at the end of [[ASIN:B00003CX9I The Conversation]] and [[ASIN:B00007976T One Hour Photo (Widescreen Edition)]], but neither of those films elicited the emotional responses that I experienced whilst watching \\"The Lives Of Others\\". Perhaps this was due to the fact that this story had an all too painful basis in the recent history of a country which once considered omnipresent surveillance, arbitrary imprisonment and state harassment to the point of suicide as legitimate tools of government; or perhaps it was due to the shocking degree of authenticity (many of the actors themselves grew up living under the yoke and suffering harassment at the hands of the Stasi and virtually all of the locations featured and surveillance equipment depicted in the film were the real mcoy), but largely I suspect the reason that I was so effected by this film was because it is simply the most perfectly realised and stunningly well-acted film of it's kind.     Ulrich Mühe gives one of the most brilliantly nuanced performances that I have ever seen as a cog who begins to realise that the machine - of which he is an initially willing component - is being maintained and run by and for the convenience of a corrupt and odious few. His is not some heroic, Damascus-style conversion to the cause of humanity but rather the quiet, diligent commitment of a man (who has been duped into giving his life to a corrupted ideal) to doing something for two gentle people who do not deserve a fate decreed by avaricious, envious Gods; the acts which he undertakes are carried out as much for his own sense of metaphysical self-preservation as for Georg and Christa-Maria's physical safety - a fact which is driven home by the very final line of the film.    However, one should not fixate on Mühe's performance alone though as the film truly is an ensemble piece in which every performance evokes the reality of lives lived under a constant state control and surveillance (and for those looking for further insight into the reality of life In the GDR, I wholeheartedly recommend Anna Funder's disturbingly fascinating book, [[ASIN:1862076553 Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall]]).        It is well known that the course of history is in fact written by a million quiet acts. But it is rare that the minutiae of one such act is so subtly, effectively and devastatingly rendered on the big screen and it is for this reason that \\"The Lives Of Others\\" deserves every accolade that it has received.

B002W6Z0UK|1.0|\\"Lady Gaga\\" possesses all of the musical artistry and innovation that she could lig from Gwen Stefani and Madonna's back catalogue without infringing the copyright, and all the visual style and flair of a little girl running amok in mummy's dressing-up box. And she wants to share it with you all.    \\"The Fame Monster\\" surely represents some sort of watershed in contemporary society: the moment, long predicted by Jean Baudrillard, when artifice would take over from substance and we all find ourselves living in Debord's \\"[[ASIN:0946061122 Society of the Spectacle]]\\".     \\"Lady Gaga\\" implores us all to join \\"the party\\" (I seem to remember Stalin imploring us to do something similar). She wants us to learn 'personal liberation' and practice 'personal freedom' - that's why the only version of this CD that you can buy has all of the curse words edited out and she's just started crowing to her fans about the joys of sexual abstinence.       This album is the kind of bland synth-poop that Madonna has been perpetrating for the last few years and Gaga attempts to pass off the best bits of Giorgio Moroder and Hazel O'Connor as her own (the iphone generation should check out O'Connor in the film [[ASIN:B00005AFSJ Breaking Glass [VHS]]] if they think that Gaga is doing anything wildly innovative vocally). It has only gained any kind of attention due to the a) increasingly mediocre nature of mainstream music and b) a patina of media-and-record-company generated controversy that surrounds it's deeply pedestrian front-woman and her knuckle-bitingly tedious lifestyle choices.    The glitterati proclaim Gaga as an innovator up there with the likes of Lennox, Bowie and Moroder when, in fact, she's nothing of the sort. In truth, If she were any more middle of the road she'd have yellow lines up her back. She's innovative in the same way that a cup of \\"Starbucks\\" coffee is innovative.     But don't take my word for it. Buy this album and find out for yourself. If you're feeling sufficiently masochistic.

B000H5TVJY|5.0|If you enjoy a movie that makes you look below the surface and actually think, \\"American Psycho\\" is exactly that. I love that I have watched this movie a few times, and there is so much to it that I look forward to the next many times I watch it, to notice and analyze much more symbolism and foreshadowing than what I did through my previous viewings. I must admit that it is very violent, even grotesque at times, but Christian Bale's acting and Mary Harron's direction are terrific.

B000059MEK|3.0|The French electronica duo Daft Punk released their second full-length album entitled Discovery in March of 2001. Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's creation differs slightly from their previous release, Homework, focusing more toward synthpop house music. The album features two hit songs in \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" and last just over an hour. Although their fans tend to love the CD, it faced diverse reviews from professional critics; Billboard rated it at 4.5 stars out of five calling it a \\"contender for the year's best dance/pop album,\\"  while Rolling Stone, on the other hand, rated it 3 stars out of five citing a weak second half to the album being a real let down.     Daft Punk utilizes a string of samples, but focuses on creating music through electronic synthesizers in this popular album. Definitely a modern version of electronic music, Daft Punk's origins lies in the early electronic music that came out of the 1960s. Matt Mathews, the father of computer music, invented the first singing computer in Bell Labs that laid the foundation for future breakthroughs in computer music. Daft Punk uses much more enhanced technology, but still apply similar techniques used by their predecessors. The tracks in Discovery use numerous beats created from short samples of real audio and electronic instruments. The group does a terrific job with picking what sounds good together as a whole and makes each song sound complete from beginning to end.   To me, there is one word that sums up the general feeling of the album: annoying. Aside from three of the first four tracks in Discovery, it was difficult to listen to because of its incessant use of repetition. The first song, \\"One More Time,\\"   although repetitive, does not fit this idea of annoying in the least. It is a typical, funky dance tune that uses optimistic lyrics along with catchy synthetic beats to get the dance floor moving. Daft Punk uses computerized vocoder effects on guest artists Romanthony's voice, giving it a metallic edge that really fits the song.    Another track that makes this album bearable is \\"Aeordynamic.\\" Released as a single in March of 2001, this instrumental track features the guitar, although it is also synthesized to fit in with the rest of he computerized sound. The fun aspect about this song is that the melody moves around from instrument to instrument by the end. You can hear similar phrases played by the guitar and other computer sounds later on. One thing Daft Punk does well at the beginning of Discovery, but kind of leaves out later, is to flow the songs into one another. The melodies fuse together used alongside pronounced bell tones that signify a new song is beginning. The French duo resort to a few seconds of silence between songs later on in the album, which makes the album feel rushed to complete.   The last song I found worthwhile was \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,\\" the fourth track in the album. Another vocoder song, Daft Punk uses the lyrics in a way less like a melody and more like a beat. Probably my favorite point in the album is near the end of the track when he duo breaks up the lyrics into short samples and uses them to create a beat breakdown. Daft Punk's use of computer music in this song was extremely well received, and even served as the basis for Kanye West's hit single \\"Stronger.\\" The two even teamed up for a performance on the Grammy's in 2008 to perform a remix version of their similarly titled songs.    The rest of Discovery is unmemorable at best. From the short and ambient tune \\"Voyager\\" to the unbearably repetitive \\"Veridis Quo,\\" the album doesn't have the polished feel that the first half of the album generates. Daft Punk uses specific loops over and over again, sometimes for more than four minutes, pushing listeners to consider skipping the rest of the track to move on to something hopefully more listenable. Unfortunately, Discovery is simply too long, which is ironically thetitle of the ten-minute long track that completes the album.   Daft Punk is one of the most well known electronic artists today, putting out hit singles that show their masterful capabilities of computer music. However, they should consider limiting releases to a few songs they put a lot of work into. Their second full-length album Discovery starts out really strong and raises listeners' hopes for the rest of it, but they fail to deliver. Their annoying use of repetition is clever at first, but soon becomes unbearable. It feels like Daft Punk just threw samples together that sounded good and then put them on loop an infinite amount of times. Altogether, their hits maybe make up for their failures, but it is imperative that they finish the job next time. I would only recommend this album to big-time fans of the French duo, asking others to just listen to what they hear from Daft Punk on the radio.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|simply put,this animated film is lots of fun.with great catch songs,fun action,and it's funny.the characters are also colourful.the voice talents are great,as well.i can't imagine more appropriate voices for the characters.the whole family can enjoy this gem.unfortunately there are a few different inferior versions of this film out that have capitalized on the Jungle Book name but they don't compare to the Disney version.if you haven't seen it yet,i'd recommend it highly.you can't go wrong,in my opinion.just make sure it's the Disney version and not one of the many other cheap knock off versions.for me,Disney's The Jungle Book is a 5/5
0061914177|5.0|I've been in business online a LONG time and this one really gives the true roadmap.  There are tons of products out there that promise the world and deliver nothing for 10 times the price of this.  Gary goes in to everything you need in order to be successful and he also stresses the fact that internet business is NOT easy and it's NOT quick.  He gives you a clear path to follow in order to achieve internet success but you have to DO IT!  I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in internet business.
0061914177|5.0|Reading this book was a turning point for me. I realized on reading the book that there really is a paradigm shift occurring and that I needed to catch up and get involved . . . or be left in the dust. Since reading the book and listening to the audio book a couple of times, I have established a video blog, put up eleven video blogs and started down the path of making the social media world work on my behalf. None of this would have occurred had I not read this straightforward, honest and passionate discussion of social media as an important tool. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in a better understanding what social media can do for your brand, whether it be personal or business.

0618918248|5.0|This was one of the first few books on atheism I have read. It was life changing, eye-opening and I was never the same after reading it. Heck, I lost my Mormon wife because of what happened after I read this book (and a few others...she wasn't tolerant of it). I used to be a fully fledged Mormon...I even served a full time mission for the church and this book still got through to me. Back in my Mormon days, I was zealous, too. I had hundreds of scriptures memorized and was into all sorts of deep doctrines. What a fool I was then (and am still today; it's amazing how little we actually know...religion isn't even close to helping though).     I remember when I purchased this book, the idea that a devil or demon was somehow manipulating my actions were still in the back of my mind (I know, isn't that absurd!) but I chose to persevere and how glad I am that I fought against the years of my religious conditioning. The inculcating drivel of the thousands of times I sang hymnals, went to church and read one LDS book after another came crashing down when I took that fateful step forward by deciding to purchase this book. I chose not to be offended like many of my friends and family get if I try to even hint at the idea that their belief system doesn't pass the slightest muster.     It was exhilarating and felt so dangerous to explore this sort of thinking and a book that would certainly lay such information on me in the most articulate way possible based on several recommendations from my non-believing friends. If you are in the same boat now as I was then and are reading this review, I implore you to keep going! Satan will not manifest! You will not go to hell! You are in the final stretch to breaking through a mental prison that has its irrational and cult-like grasp on you.     If I could give two books as a recommendation to new atheists/agnostics/etc. in general, it would be this book and Sam Harris' End of Faith. This one being the more scholarly in nature (keep yourdictionary close by) but just mentally refreshing in so many ways. Some lines in the book, especially in reference to the personal character of the Abrahamic/Islamic view of God are downright damming because Dawkins is able to articulate what and who they are based on Biblical passages so well. The Bible alone damns the absurdity of the idea of a personal God, his commandments and character. But, that's a small taste. There is a smorgasbord of content here. Some of the things I uncovered, like Einstein's true pantheistic beliefs (based on his own words and bigoted responses from his peers) seem to have never been clear but now are.    If I had one disagreement, it is that he finds agnosticism a poor philosophy. I couldn't disagree more. Personally, I find agnosticism great and I am serious about it while being able to pretty much agree with most of the content of this book. I don't claim to know everything but I am on board with the peril organized religion has shackled humanity with and Dawkins' argues that with absolute clarity.

I had no previous opinions about this movie and I don't know how much more pleasantly suprised I could have been. The storyline was original and extremely entertaining. The casting was perfect. Woody Harrelson in his most fun role since Natural Born Killers.   And to top it off probably one of the BEST cameo appearances EVER (I may be biased on that point since I am a HUGE HUGE fan).   To sum it up, pick it up and I'm pretty sure most people would enjoy this very humorous film.

0307454541|4.0|oh, hello bandwagon.  wait for me!<br /><br />so, i've seen this book in stores forever now and, i swear, every time i walked by i'd pick it up and not buy it.  the synopsis just seemed so... boring. i mean, financial crimes and journalism, a tattooed girl - it all seemed sounded so dull and contrived.  but, in the end, i broke down and gave it a shot and i have to admit that i really enjoyed it.<br /><br />the story centers on two people who couldn't be more different, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander (reminds me of salamander, but that's neither here nor there).  Blomkvist is a financial journalist recently convicted of libel against a well-known and powerful financier.  Salander is an unlikely researcher, tattooed and anorexic looking, with deep seated hatred of the twisted, manipulative men of the world, that unfortunately seem to be drawn to her.  the two meet in a series of unlikely events while researching the mysterious disappearance of a girl that occurred nearly 40 years ago.  and from there, the book unravels with a murder mystery, family saga and trickle of love story, all equally engaging.<br /><br />the writing is very journalistic, often very wordy and can be a bit of a drag, particularly in the beginning while the stage is being set.  however, it's also very effective in carrying the small details that make this an excellent suspense novel, with so many possible outcomes.  the overload of information helps to transform the reader into a mini-detective and it really gets the synapses firing.<br /><br />the strength of the book, in my eyes, is the psychological intensity of the characters.  Lisbeth is a real mystery, intelligent, quirky and intriguing, a real stand out character.  her apparent emotional strength paired with her vulnerability is written so well that it's hard to believe that she is a fictional character.  Blomkvist is sincere and very likeable, the type of person we all wish we knew, in high contrast with some of the other men in the novel.<br /><br />Larsson uses The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo to make a rather captivating statement about the stark realities of sexual and physical abuse, presented in a psychological thriller that is highly readable. i'd recommend this to anyone that can get through the dredge of political and financial wordiness to get to the heart of a great mystery.rl With the Dragon Tattoo to make a rather captivating statement about the stark realities of sexual and physical abuse, presented in a psychological thriller that is highly readable. i'd recommend this to anyone that can get through the dredge of political and financial wordiness to get to the heart of a great mystery.

B00337KMAA|5.0|Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, [[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]]), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.<br /><br />But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman, [[ASIN:B002VEJKQI Smokin' Aces]]) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.<br /><br />Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga, [[ASIN:B000M5AJQI The Departed]]) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.<br /><br />As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. \\"Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships.\\"<br /><br />But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.<br /><br />It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|Like most others I was a big fan of Funeral.  Instead of a normal review I'll give you a timeline of my impression of this great album.<br /><br />1. First couple of listens.  Underwhelmed.  Almost none of the instantly catchy complexity of Funeral.  Obviously a sophomore slump of an album.  I'll go back to Funeral for a while.<br /><br />2. Keep listening anyway. This is pretty deep and dark, heavy music.  A couple of these songs are actually really good though.  Antichrist Television Blues is really good, maybe a couple others.<br /><br />3. Wait a minute, a couple of these other songs are pretty good too.  I'm starting to like about half of these songs, maybe more.<br /><br />4. Ocean of Noise might be a masterpiece.  I'm listening to this album at work with my headphones on all the time.<br /><br />5. This album is a work of art. How come I didn't \\"get it\\" the first time?  I must be crazy.<br /><br />The truth is, the music on this album is complex and layered.  There's no way to catch all of it with a casual listen or two.  Still, some of the songs are too dramatic and broody for my tastes.  If you wanna tap into that mood then this album will let you do it.<br /><br />I still wonder how these guys managed to pull of such fantastic music on their 1st and 2nd albums.  Not just great but best-of-the-decade great.  I am a fan.

B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is definitely the most wonderful and visually amazing movie i've ever seen. I can't stop watching it on dvd. It deserves a top quality bluray-version, no doubt about that! I hope it gets an 8K treatment just as Baraka. I'm pretty into this movie and I know it has a lot of die-hard fans who only think the same: GET IT ON BLU RAY, please!!! And start with Powaqqatsi/Naqoyqatsi too, because it's a trilogy that needs to be seen at high definition. Write a review too if you agree!
0061914177|5.0|This book is great, anyone slightly interested in how the business world is changing should pick up this book, as large companies pepsi, coke, nbc, dell, and others have now caught on, there is still plenty of room for small companies & personal brands to make big things happen via social media. In my opinion this is less of a fad and more of trend that we are all pioneering now, that will be with us for many many years to come.  The advertising world has changed, how consumers get their content has changed and gary has always been ahead of his time, in leading fortune 500 brands and micro-\\"mom across the street\\" personal brands into social media success.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in social media, then after you read it, reach out to gary you can find him anywhere and start learning even more.
B00005JL78|4.0|Directed by Steven Speilburg, this science-fiction murder mystery is an engrossing dark and brooding story.  Tom Cruise plays the lead, John Anderton, the story takes place in 2054 in Washington, DC.  Precrime has eliminated murder cases thanks to three mediums called precognitive thinkers.  The Precogs are kept in a law enforcement \\"temple\\" floating in life-sustaining fluids with their brains hooked up to electrodes.  This is so their psychic thoughts can be beamed to police screens and searched for clues on the next murder.<br /><br />John Anderton is a Precrime enforcer, whose young son was abducted and never seen again.  This tragedy ruined a marriage and caused him to use some kind of neuro drug he buys on the streets.  John is dedicated to arrest and jail would-be murderers before they kill.  Soon, a young and ambitious federal agent (Collin Farrell) shows up on the scene.  The director of Precrime (Max von Sydow) wants to make the program national, and feels threatened.  During this visit to find a flaw in the system, Anderton finds himself accused of a future murder of a man he does not know.  He no longer thinks Precrime is fail-proof.  The Precrime police chase him as they realize he will commit a murder.<br /><br />The movie is an exciting murder mystery, with imaginative special effects and a lesson on humanity's trust in hi-tech and big brother tactics.
0060512806|5.0|Being over a 1000 pages may put some people off this book but it was an amazing read and wished it had gone for couple of hundred extra (it seemed rushed at the end). It may seem chopped between multiple dissimilar plot lines over a complex array of characters but the underlying pattern locks into place. Like the rich puzzle the book actually is. The rich plot lines are added to by a detailed technical aspect of the book which may have you cracking the pages of \\"applied crypto\\" by schneier. Though it work perfectly well without knowing that book. I have not enjoyed a book as much since the \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\". Highly recommended.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Very sad story.  Hard to watch such a beautiful person with so many problems spiral downhill.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|The LIFE series is simply fantastic! I watched the entire original series which is narrated by the great David Attenborough.<br /><br />THIS version is narrated by the extremely lame Oprah. I agree with all the other reviewers here...she sounds like she is reading a bedtime story. My wife and I just caught 10 minutes of this Oprah version on TV and couldn't bare watching it. It's really that bad. I really wish someone, someday gets up the nerve to actually say NO to Oprah. From what I've read she ASKED Discovery to narrate this series.<br /><br />So do yourself a gigantic favor and make sure you purchase the series which is narrated by Attenborough, in Blu Ray. This Oprah version is simply a joke.
B0036CWK8O|2.0|Just to start off I am a huge Helloween fan.  The band has a uniquie style of \\"pop thrash\\" with many prog touches.  What I expected from this album was redone versions of classic Helloween songs with the current line up.  What we get is a bizzare mix of show tunes and classical music that does not work in the context.  Sure adding classical elements can sometimes add to metal music, but this album replaces the metal sound with strings and horns with hardly any metal music to be found.  In fact these new versions suck the life out of many classic songs. A couple of songs may work as an obscure B side but as a complete CD it gets old very fast.  This album is a bold experament, but that experament fails.  If you are looking for a starting point for Helloween's music \\"Tresure Chest\\" is a great compilation showcasing their music.  This album is only for the die hard fans that have to own everything Helloween, and even for them it may remain on the shelf unplayed.

B003102JDM|1.0|I will go into this as politely as I can.  First, I am a devout Coen Brothers fan and have loved all of their work; however, this is the first movie I have viewed by them that was a disappointment.  I understand about the curse and I found it funny that the writer/director focused the movie on the curse very little.<br /><br />The characters were believable and it had my attention from start to end, however, there was just something it desperately lacked.  In many ways it didn't feel like a Coen Brothers movie and due to the many other great endeavors the brothers have achieved, this specific title just left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the pace of the movie, maybe I was expecting another O Brother Where Art Thou or The Hudsucker Proxy, or maybe every genius is entitled to flop at one time or another, regardless I was entertained but left feeling senseless.<br /><br />I will give myself a few months and try this movie again but I sadly feel it will have the same results and I feel I'm forcing myself to like something that isn't my style.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|There are those CDs that you have to listen to a couple of times before you decide that you really like it.  Funhouse isn't one of them.  From the moment I started listening, I was hooked.  Pink is fantastic, as always!
0470477237|5.0|Many businesses are wondering if social media really matters, and if it does, how do we leverage it to help propel our organization forward. Socialnomics sets the stage for the first part of that question, confirming that, yes, it does matter. Yes, people are listening and talking. And yes, this completely changes the way we do business in the future. Winners in the socialnomics world will have to be cunning, creative and willing to take risks. It's a great read for anyone wondering if this is just a fad or something more. It's more -- a lot more! If you're looking for a how-to guide, look elsewhere, but you'll get some great foundations to help your mind switch gears to use social media in your business.
0393072231|5.0|Usually I start a book and put it down half way through the read as most books aren't able to hold my attention, however finishing this one was no problem and was a page turner in every way. Not only was this book entertaining but it was also informative and educational. Lewis has a gift for lifting the veil of Wall Street jargon and put to pen what is really happening in terms any layman can understand. Not only does Lewis demystify what was going on inside the big financial firms leading up to the crisis, he is also able to make cutting social observations that he channels through the real life characters in the book. As any good author he saves his best observation for the end of the book and doesn't belabor the point, but simply points out how both the winners and losers all walked away millionaires and rewarded for their efforts. Simply playing the game is enough if you're at the pinnacle of modern finance as practiced in the United States, regardless of your decisions.

1594488878|5.0|I've read pretty much all Hornby's books--I loved HIGH FIDELITY and HOW TO BE GOOD, but some of the others missed their mark (with the exception of FEVER PITCH, which I adored). JULIET, NAKED is the story of a (mostly) non-sexual three-way: Duncan, who has devoted most of his life to his obsession with Tucker Crowe, a musician who has been in artistic retirement for many years, and Duncan's girlfriend, Annie. Annie and Tucker begin an unlikely email relationship and Duncan begins an equally unlikely affair with another woman.    As a music obsessionist, I could related to Duncan and his fellow internet obsessives deciphering every lyric and making connections both conceivable and impossible to prove. Fortunately, I have more of a life than he does (or so I tell myself). I also related to Annie's musings on her life being wasted and using something or someone to avoid living out your dreams. I even understand being creatively stunted, as Tucker Crowe is for some time and for some very good reasons.     Most fortunate of all, the book is about much more than identifying with one or more characters. It is about redemption and relationships and it is exceedingly funny. It also shows a frighteningly accurate picture of fanboards--but also the power and the reward of online connections when you share a common and rare interest in something or someone.     I suspect that I am being generous in giving the book five stars, but if I were being less personal, I'd only take it down one star at most.     P.S. Be sure to look at the cover art of the book after reading it. It is a visual pun that works on several levels.
1847396240|3.0|The subject is fascinating but the writing is tepid at best.  I finished this book because it is a subject that as we age becomes more and more fascinating but I was very disappointed in the character development. You really want to know how the disease progresses but nothing in the characterization draws you to be interested in the characters themselves. All are very superficially depicted.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|This is a psychological thriller.  It is about a young couple living together in a home who are menaced by some kind of ghostly being or thing.  Turns out that this thing has followed the young lady around all of her life.  The entire film takes place in their home, mostly in the bedroom at night.  There is some imaginative film making here, but this is only an average film.  We learn almost nothing about the couple, their lives, or anything much except for how this thing haunts them.  In other words there is not much of a plot the way there is, for example, in the film \\"Poltergeist.\\"  There are some scary parts, but nothing exceptional.  This is not the kind of film likely to keep anyone awake at night.<br /><br />I think that part of my frustration with this film is my notion that it could have been much better.  With some more character development (and maybe more characters) this one might have really taken off.  As it is, there is some impact here, but this is overall a disappointing film, albeit a reasonably entertaining one.<br /><br />Better for a rental than a purchase.  RJB.
0393072231|5.0|I'm always impressed with Michael Lewis's ability to take a relatively dry subject (i.e. mortgage-backed \\"securities\\"), and make it almost impossible to turn from.  As usual, I couldn't put this book down.  I always wondered how Wall Street was able to get the ratings agencies (S&P and Moody's, et al) to play ball with these ridiculous subprime mortgages, and Lewis does a great job of shedding light on it.  This book will really make you question reality...
B000JIJPZY|4.0|We bought this when my baby girl needed some tummy time.  She hated tummy time, but loved to lay on her back and stare at the toys.  I think this gym was helpful when she was learning to reach and grab at toys, too.  She even loved to sit in her Bumbo and play with the toys from that angle.  Overall, we got a lot of play time hours out of this gym, and I even made up words to the song the little white tiger plays.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|The instructions left something to be desired, but after an online tutorial we were off and settling, every day for a week! Even our family not usually drawn into gamefun and the 14yr old video-gamer enjoyed this one.    The biggest problem was the quality of the board. The edge pieces wouldn't stay connected, making the inner pieces slide around. Still fun to play but wish they made the pieces better.
B00275EGWY|5.0|A.O. Scott of The New York Times described Kathryn Bigelow's \\"The Hurt Locker,\\" winner of the 2009 Best Picture Oscar, as \\"visceral visual poetry.\\" It's all that and a bag of TNT.   Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner is the dark in Bigelow's Heart of Darkness. Renner's character is named William James, the same name as the philosopher and founder of American pragmatism. The real-world James wrote \\"The Varieties of Religious Experience.\\" The James of \\"The Hurt Locker\\" undergoes a religious experience in finding his essential self in more of the same.   Sandborn (played by Anthony Mackie), a bomb-squad partner of James, is changing tracks at movie's end but one wonders whether the Iraq experience hasn't disconnected his emotional wires, making such a transition impossible. The name Sandborn gives us modest hope that the soldier's essential self has been born through the Middle East experience. Whether that can be grasped and handled by Sandborn's statewide lady is another matter entirely, another movie awaiting Bigelow's production.   A psychologist colonel with another appropriate name - Cambridge - shows us that Ivy Leaguers have no place in today's war-making other than pushing buttons way away from the combat theater and sharpening pencils Bob McNamara-style. Street fighters like James and Sandborn are the lions of Baghdad and that's probably at the heart of James' peace with war.   Linking the founder of American pragmatism with Pax Americana is a deft commentary by Bigelow on how far the U.S. has drifted away from prudence.   Sandborn's courage is a nod from Bigelow to the disproportionate sacrifices of black soldiers since America went to a \\"volunteer\\" globe-trotting military. The declining economic and social opportunities for most Americans (thanks mostly to the same profligate government that got us into the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan) makes \\"volunteering\\" a bit different from free will, especially for blacks.   Speaking of will, Bigelow's Will James is a compelling personification of The Will as described by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Like Schopenhauer's Will, Bigelow's character is stark and unforgettable.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis once again gives us another informative, easy-to-read classic that keeps you turning the pages on a topic not typically exciting to the general masses.  It further builds his case as a master storyteller who never fails to do an incredible job with his research and interviews to provide a perfect picture of what transpired.
0061914177|5.0|Gary... Thank you. You rocked the crap out this book. I can't get enough of your \\"realness\\". The book was a great extension of the great stuff we see of you in your keynotes. True story..... WANTED your book when it first came out. Went to B&N and the Borders bookstore in my city. No go at either. I was frustrated, I wanted it now. Found a way to fulfill my instinct gratification and paid and downloaded it off B&N's site and read the whole thing from their e-reader the first day. Just THANK YOU GARY!!! Waiting patiently for your next books!

0887307280|5.0|The EMyth Revisited was suggested to me by my business coach.  The book changed the way I do business.  I love being the technician, and I see now how that can be detrimental to the success of my company.  I must work on the business as well as in the business.  I must find that healthy balance.

B00004TVV1|5.0|This disc is for the man who has everything. Everybody should have two copies - one for the house and one for the car. Give it as a gift - no person who listens to \\"The Great Summit\\" will mind having two.   The incomparable voice and trumpet of Satchmo (Louis Armstrong) are in the full bloom. Duke Ellington wisely leaves Armstrong up front to fandazzle Ellington's compositions while Duke acts as Cecil B. DeMille through his piano.   Ellington and Armstrong came together between tours in 1961. Their collaboration captured the spring the U.S. was then experiencing before the Kennedy assassination and everything else that came crashing down in the `60s and `70s. Smiling beneath the crush of the headlines, Satchmo never lost his joy of living through music and that's forever preserved on \\"The Great Summit.\\" Ellington goes extra extra in strengthening his position as jazz's greatest multi-tasker. Get this disc and hear all about it.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|It is a rare treat when my husband and I both love the same movie.  Watson and Holmes were portrayed as younger men than I remember them seeming in the stories I had read and much more athletic.  I expected a more thoughtful movie but it was a surprisingly fun action adventure with a lot of one-liners that caught the audience off-guard and made us laugh out loud frequently.  It waa a fun watch and I would take my 13 year old or older to it (I am conservative and some of the humorous sexual alllusions make me hesitant to view with my younger children).  The relationship between Holmes and Watson is the main focus but a love interest or two are a close second to the focus.  Downey was a perfect match to portray Holmes' irreverance, drug dependence and maverick style.  Totally believable.
0061914177|5.0|I had seen Gary speak a couple of times before I read \\"Crush It!\\"  I knew what I was in for when I sat down with the book.  Gary is full of sincerity and energy.  The book isn't a literary masterpiece and I doubt if it was intended to be one.  It is an American success story about achieving and believing.  He identifies a low cost way of self and product branding and capitalizing on our interests and passions.  The tools are out there for all of us.  We just need to get at it.    If you are looking for a handbook, get Blogging for Dummies.  If you want a success story and a little kick in the butt...this is it.      I applaud Gary for monetizing his online presence!!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|This series, about four ubernerds and a good-looking gal, is consistently inventive, unexpected, and hilarious.  The first season was wonderful and I was concerned that the extremity could not be continued for a second season, but I was definitely wrong.  It continues to be one of my favorite sitcoms, right up there with The IT Crowd (check that one out as well).
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I would love to watch this series with no narration instead of Oprah. How can one person take a stunning work of photography and life and turn it into something that is irritating to listen to. What a horrible mistake , I will get the BBC version.
B000001ZS3|5.0|For me Oxygene is the crowning of \\"classic\\" electronic. The first time I listened to it I was so absorbed that my rational mind didn't even attempt to make a critical judgment of it, it was just lost. The second time the only thing I thought was \\"this must have taken the same effort of a symphony to create\\", and I wasn't even taking into account that it came out in a year that looks like the stone age from here, in term of the technology available to do electronic music.<br /><br />This music speaks of things that exist in a domain of their own, too important and too frivolous to be expressed in any other way that with music. Like a battle of gods, a love story between ghosts, a joke that the wind tells to the trees.

B0010DRYS2|3.0|A watchable film, which--in my opinion--doesn't even come close to the outstanding Donnie Brascoe. The widescreen DVD is very good.
1589944607|5.0|There is a game called \\"werewolves,\\" or, alternately, \\"mafia\\" - the way it works, one person is secretly a killer, and chooses someone to die every night, and the other non-mafia/wolf players need to figure out who the killer is, and then kill them.    This board game is very similar to that mechanic (one to two ppl are hidden cylons) BUT - unlike werewolves / mafia, wherein a person who was killed may have to sit out the WHOLE rest of the game, in this game no one dies. Even if you are an outed Cylon, you still have a part to play in the game.     So, having said that, this game is excellent.  All the players interact with each other to stave off crises that effect the ship.  Everyone, face down, throws down cards which effect the crisis.  The cylons will throw down cards that hurt, but you don't know who threw what card (plus two cards are randomly mixed in), so you do not know who the cylons are.      Example of play:    My turn: the galactica ship has taken heavy damage from a cylon basestar (4/6 - @ 6 game over) - including the warp drive, therefore we cannot jump away from the ships attacking us, and I, as Admiral Adama, cannot repair the warp myself.  ON my action turn I use a card that gives another play a free move and action interrupt that takes place instead of my action.  I give this power to the engineer, who moves to the warp drive, and repairs it - the card he uses to repair it grants him another action, which he uses to engage the now repaired warp drive (known as FTL [faster than light] in this game), and he gets our badly damaged butts out of there.  It was highly dramatic, and we all crowed with success when we did it.      NOW - imagine that the engineer player was secretly a cylon - and took that extra action I gave him to declare he was a cylon, and to hurt the team?    Thats the dynamic at play.  You work with your teammates and try to save the ship, and to get home, but you do not know who is a cylon or not.    Fantastic, fantastic game.  I cannot wait to play again.  Best with 4-6 ppl, games take anywhere from 1-3 hours (usually in the middle.).    Thumbs up.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The picture quality is better than any other concert I have seen on blu-ray.    Shooting on 35mm film was definitely the right choice.The colors are all highly saturated and the detail is amazing. You can see the dust and finger prints on the monitors, the uneven texture on the surface of Brian's guitar and all the little details in Roger's drum kit. I have never seen a more beautiful concert video; and to think this was shot 25 years ago.    The sound is excellent too,but LPCM Uncompressed stereo is far better then Dolby True 5.1 HD.    Musically the band is in great.Freddie's vocals are gift from god and his live performance catched by every eyes.    Even though Queen were at their peak in popularity when they filmed this performance, in my opinion this was not their artistic peak.The only thing which added flavor to the concert was High Definition.The first ever concert was shot in HD in 1981.    Its recommended to any great fan of Freddy Mercury.The Legends.....and a god performer on the stage.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|\\"Pandorum\\" was one of those rare films that blew me away and exceeded every expectation I had for it. From the mysterious opening to the horrific finale, this film is a work of carefully constructed perfection. Was it dark? Yes. Was it violent? Yes, but not gratuitously so. Was it tasteful? Totally! That's where this film succeeds where so many have failed. The STORY is the forefront of this film, and it really comes through.

B003BLXKK2|5.0|\\"I loved the first movie, but this one sucks.\\"  I keep reading this line and it makes no sense.  This movie is essentially very similar to the first, and that's why I like it so much.  Duffy made a few tweaks here and there, brought in a Godfather II type of back story, and gave us, for the first time, a strong female character.  Julie Benz does a great job in the role - shows that attractiveness isn't all in the curves.  Connor and Murphy often take a backseat to other plot elements, giving more of the movie to establishing Eunice's character and the Duke's backstory.  Yet we already know them.  You would likely have to watch the first movie to really get into this one, but if you don't own the first movie already, why are you even reading the Amazon description of this one?

Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have INCREDIBLE on screen chemistry, and the writing is \\"quip a minute\\" bliss. To ice the cake, musical master Hans Zimmer takes the entire production to new and flavorful levels! I highly recommend this film.

Don't get me wrong, I loved parts of Deadwing, but it was the start of a very bleak period in their music (which is still there to some extent with this album).  Fear of a Blank Planet was nearly impossible to listen to, both in terms of tone and the music itself, which seemed pretty uninspired (depression is not conducive to inspiration).  This harks back to their early psychedelic roots, especially Pink Floyd, while maintaining the sophistication of their later works.    I think it would have worked better as a single CD compilation, but its easy to just groove for a long time with this.  Again, harking back to earlier groups and concept albums.
0061914177|5.0|I considered buying the hardcopy, but downloaded the audio version instead for four reasons:<br /><br />1. Gary Vaynerchuk is a super energetic public speaker.<br />2. He tends to go off the script and gives audio book listeners tips not mentioned in the written book.<br />3. I find it easier to remember things through repetitive listening. Usually after hearing an audio book for at least three times, I implement the lessons learned unconsciously. My brain goes on autopilot.<br />4. I like to listen to audio books while exercising and writing. This allows me to keep my hands busy while my mind is free to absorb tons of information.<br /><br />What's best about the audio book?<br /><br />1. Gary goes into extensive detail about the importance of building business communities on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. He stresses the importance of consistent transparency.<br /><br />2. Lots of personal examples are given. He shares what he's learned from his mistakes.<br /><br />3. He has a great sense of humor and makes you laugh. Some people might be annoyed by his New Jersey accent, but I love it. I like the fact that he's straight to the point and raw.<br /><br />Though I haven't listened to the audio book yet for the third time - my magic number - I've found the advice given so far to be easy to implement. But, and this is important, once you start implementing Gary's advice it's going to take lots of effort to maintain the flow. I've already gotten excellent results after listening to the book once, but I've been stepping outside of my comfort zone on a daily basis. Thankfully it's getting easier for me to open up and take risks.<br /><br />I'll update my review after 90 days of using the material. By then I'll be able to point out what has worked best for me. But right now it's too early to write a more detailed review.<br /><br />- Peace

Best instrumental disc in years, as a fan of all Mehldau's efforts this is the first recording he made that is sure to live long past his lifetime. A masterpiece for those will open ears, a piece of work that warms my heart and makes me feel a bit more happy to be on Earth after it's tone has pass through me. In a month time this is becoming music I can't image being without again.
B0007ZEO4G|4.0|The title track is a perfect example of Blackmore's genius to use other's ideas in wholly original ways: George Gershwin would be proud. A great deal of credit is due to Coverdale, who with minimal professional experience, successfully replaced one of the world's greatest vocalists. After repeated listenings it finally dawned how good he was. Hughes isn't too shabby either on bass or vocals. These two voices complement each other perfectly and gave DP Mk.3 a distinctive identity. Pity it ended up with the superbly performed but very confused \\"Stormbringer\\" and lamentable \\"Come Taste the Band\\". Lord channels Bach in the title track, and Paice is his usual brilliant swing rock drumming self.<br /><br />Required listening.

Now to the product; As with my other reviews on music I will attempt not to compare this CD set (of 11) to anything. All said, I found the performance to be of great quality and I suppose so was the composition. I'm way too new to classical music but still found the CDs to be great to listen to at anytime. I did not yawn (LOL) as I normally do when I do not enjoy music.

B002WY65W4|5.0|This was a kick-butt zombie flick! There were plenty of zombies, lots of killings, many modes of killing (I mean, who wants to see them killed the same way over and over again?), plenty of blood and gore without being gratuitous and enough comic relief to make it funny but not belittle the storyline. What more can you ask for in a zombie flick? Okay, a cameo by you-know-who and it's a winner!<br />Well, the zombie killing rules were outstanding!! Rule #2, \\"Double Tap\\"...stuff like that lives on way after the movie is over and makes you want to buy the DVD. My husband and I walked out of the movie saying...\\"We must own this movie!\\" Zombie kill of the week is great, in fact, I can't think of any parts I didn't like!<br />If you enjoy good cheesy horror flicks...you'll enjoy this one! Get it, grab a cold one and a tub of popcorn and sit down for a good time.

0679721037|4.0|First published in 1946, this simple little book recounts the experiences of six civilian inhabitants of Hiroshima who survived the atomic blast on August 6, 1945.  Few residents recall hearing any sound from the explosion, just the bright flash and the shock wave.  Even those who died soon after most often did so in silence.  The book tells what those 6 were doing that morning, what happened when the atomic bomb exploded, and how they coped in the hours, days, weeks and months that followed.  The final chapter returns 40 years later to follow up on the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I've heard rave and almost reverential recommendations of this book and wondered if my thoughts would be changed by reading it.  The text is mostly straightforward and seemingly neutral in its judgment; it reports that most Hiroshimans did not blame the US for the bomb, they just wanted to get on with their lives as best they could.  It is not until the very end that it seems to take on an agenda, and while I found the initial part of the book fascinating and compelling, the follow-up chapter was disappointing.  It isn't especially graphic or horrific in its account, but does portray what ordinary Japanese experienced, and made me feel grateful that such weapons have not been used since 1945.<br /><br />I think this is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the topic to read.  But I would urge you *not* to read with the intent to fortify your views either way - the book's focus is much too narrow for such - but to read it for the history and human experience it reports.

B0033AGPF8|3.0|Anyone considering purchasing this title on Legacy should be aware that the has been very significant bass boost applied to the vinyl release of Axis.  Appparently this sounds the same as the previous universal re-issue and on my system it results in unacceptably boomy bass on many tracks(Rega turntable).   I have several other copies of Axis (including an original Australian black label Polydor and the Classics mono re-issue) and none of them have this artifically boosted bass response.

Thanks Gary.
B003954I9C|5.0|I've waited years for this release and it was worth the wait!  I was pleased to see that AJ actually wrote most of the songs himself.  Every song is different sounding and shows a wide-range of music from ballads to fun dance tunes!  Those looking for AJ's soulful voice will find it in the song \\"London\\".  AJ also shows his fun side (and his kinky, sexy side!) in \\"Drive By Love\\" and \\"Love Crazy\\".    AJ proved to me that if and when BSB breaks up, he'll be fine on his own musically.
0061914177|4.0|The content of this book is 100% Gary. Totally enjoyed it. If you follow him online, you've already heard him talk about most of what's in here (except you do get some insight into how he got started and his life). His message is clear and real - The details of the technology doesn't matter nearly as much as passion and hustle. Know your DNA, niche yourself, get out there on every platform that matters and differentiate yourself with effort and time. Not something that a lot of people want to hear, but that's what's real. The book is short - only 140 pages, so you fly through it, and it's like getting a booster shot of energy in the arm. If you can, get the Crush IT VOOK so you get Gary on video throughout too.

0375826726|5.0|After reading this book and its predecessors so many times to the point of almost memorization, I still can't see why this book and the series gets all the crap it receives today.  Anyway...    Positives:  -Descriptive  -Relates to reader (to me at least)  -Amazing battle scenes  -A lot between the lines, touching on religion, age, love...  -Fascinating plot and fictional universe  -Cool character interaction  -Eragon & Saphira  -All these things going on that haven't been addressed yet like Eragon's prochecy, his dreams that supposedly tell the future (two people in a boat and dragons going away in the distance while figure on the beach shouts and cries in despair), and his unrevealed promise with the Menoa tree    Things to Note  -Unnecessary Length?  I never found myself bored during any part of this book  -Bad Writing Style?  Personal taste.  Totally escapes me; in fact, I find the writing style helps put me into the story  -Predictable Plot?  Nowhere in the book, although perhaps I should have seen the \\"Brom as father\\" revelation coming.      Negatives  -Lack of originality? I personally think it's justified as nothing can really be original nowadays and nothing specific was stolen from say, Lord of the Rings or Star Wars  -Extremely long period of time I have to wait before the next book comes out.  When will it be... the end of this year (2010) at the soonest.  Maybe 2011?  I hope the book comes out before the world supposedly comes to an end LOL    Great book that's completely underrated.  If you begin and finish this book without reading to much into the surface issues that I read about after I finished the book such as petty accusations of plagiarism and unnecessary length, I'm sure you will enjoy this book and the colorful series.      In my opinion, this \\"cycle\\" only gets better and better.  I'm glad that CP decided to turn the trilogy into a cycle.  Simply read, and you will like it.

When I heard \\"Holiday\\" all my friends and I were like, who is that?  Well, we soon found out, along with the rest of the world.  Since 7th grade I have liked most of Madonna's music, there are some things I think are just too on the edge.  My husband was surprised that I asked for the cd set for Christmas.  I have had it for several months now and like all the songs, even the new ones I had not heard.  I have copies in my minivan and on my laptop and usually crank it up to clean house with!  So for those of you who are 40ish and remember when, you might be pleasantly surprised at what you get on this set.<br /><br />Definitely worth the $17!

0439023483|4.0|I read this book in one go, as I do all my books.  Although the book may not have captured me as much as most because its plot is pretty familiar to me, it still had its moments.  I've seen this plot (teenagers fight for their lives because of some satanic government) in Battle Royale, which was also preceded by Grapes of Wrath, which shares albeit more loosely, this theme as well.    Anyway, the characterization was done really well.  Being a 17-year-old boy with no siblings, I was still able to relate to the experiences of Katniss and her life-threatening venture to protect her little sister.  I feel the romantic angle between Katniss and Peeta was well-done although it may have been a little fast to seem realistic.  This could be different for others, but I favor slow plot progressions for a more intimate experience.  The ending of the book was very well-written, a major cliff-hanger which I won't spoil.  Most cliff-hangers are rather tasteless and unsatisfying but this book's was, which further shows the skill of the writer.      Great book with an interesting plot.  For me, it was dampened because of my great expectations upon realizing the theme of having a death match, as I compared it to the books I read that preceded it (Battle Royale).  I guess I was biased to begin with.    If you start reading with an impartial temperament which I failed to do, it should be a suspenseful ride.  Each chapter's end is really a cliff-hanger if you have the mind to see it.
078815690X|5.0|Henry Kissinger's \\"Diplomacy\\" is a terrific primer for anyone interested in the concepts of Realpolitik and how it has manifested in world history. Although I found his chapters on Vietnam to be loathsome (he at one point expresses his sympathy to the Cambodian people) and Chile and the overthrow of Allende were suspiciously absent, Kissinger's insight in world history are concise and brilliant. His chapters on the genius of Otto von Bismark are especially a must-read. One cannot understand Realpolitik without knowing about Bismark; he truly was the master of diplomacy. Kissinger may be a war criminal, but he definitely knows his history and knows how to write a good history book. The length of the book may scare some people away, but anyone true student of history needs to read this.
0061914177|5.0|I usually avoid \\"self help\\" books, but Gary's infectious personality got me thinking. Crush It has some useful information about Social Media but most importantly it makes you think! I believe that most people have a skill they can use to live their dream life, and Crush It helps you start to think of ways of making this happen. It's not an answer to everything, you have to use the information and shape it for your life, and your passion.    When it comes down to it I had a different view on life and my career after reading Crush It. If you blindly follow everything in there, as with anything else, you are asking for trouble. But if you take inspiration and use the information wisely, it will change your life.    I thank Gary Vaynerchuk for taking the time to write this book. Yeah it's about money, but it's really about people too. It really doesn't matter how Gary started, Crush It is a useful addition to anyone's library
B001FB55L2|4.0|The theatrical trailer for this film left me disinterested. I have a brother. I didn't want to see some movie about a wife cheating with her brother-in-law, particularly with a war hero as the foil for her actions. I didn't want to see a silly thriller with serious themes as the backdrop.<br /><br />Thankfully, \\"Brothers\\" is closer to an indie film than a suspense story. It takes a hard look at family life and the effects of war on a marriage, children, and those who stand on the front lines. When Sam (Tobey Maguire) heads off for another tour in Afghanistan, he leaves behind a beautiful wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters, as well as his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's been recently released from prison. The relationships are established clearly, and the acting is superb all around. The story takes a turn when Sam seems to have died in combat. He has, in fact, survived as a prisoner of the Taliban, but his family back home mourns his loss, and slowly begins to put back together the pieces. There are some poignant moments, and the parallels between Sam's war experiences and his father's--in Vietnam--create an interesting dynamic.<br /><br />The story's tension picks up when Sam is faced with some horrible ethical decisions to survive. It's hard to judge or understand, and for some, his decision will seem unbelievable. For the sake of his family, he makes a hard choice, and I was willing to go with it. When he returns home, though, he is still suffering the psychological trauma of the war, and he begins to suspect his brother and wife of sleeping together. This leads to some suspenseful moments, but the deeper issue is his mental struggle to hang on after his decisions. I was afraid the last half-hour would turn into a mindless chase through suburbia, but instead the story concludes with some bittersweet moments that leave us pondering the horrors our brave soldiers experience.<br /><br />This is neither a suspense thriller (as advertised), nor some steamy story about a love triangle (as also advertised...using a child to spread the lie, of all things!). It is a serious look at the need to care for our soldiers, for their families, and not allow this cycle to continue into the next generations. It has a few forced moments, but the overall affect is more thought-provoking than I expected.e triangle (as also advertised...using a child to spread the lie, of all things!).

0340896965|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written, page-turning, entertaining book which captured a lot of the feel of the last twenty years.  It is both a light and deep character study of two individuals and their strengths and weaknesses, foibles and what turned them onto and off each other, also with some well-drawn minor characters and interesting twists and turns, including one or two really moving episodes.  It drew neatly, too, on the background that had helped turn them into what they were.   There's also a strong satirical element on. for example, student life, youth television, modern food and the difficulties of parenthood which completely hits the mark.
B000026OW3|5.0|There may be a way of enhancing your life better than by spending $30 on this magical set, but I don't know what it is. If you want to take your life out of the mundane, just place any of the first ten discs of this collection in your player and settle back to be transported to a higher realm of being. Rubinstein's playing transcends playing - the sense that the music is playing itself rather than being \\"interpreted\\" is as strong as I have experienced. Some reviewers find it a little too low-voltage, and if you like your Chopin to be restless, mercurial, searching, and echt-romantic, this may not be quite to your taste. I think, however, that Rubinstein gets closer to the heart of this music with his luminously natural approach than rivals who make the music sound \\"complex\\". Rubinstein makes these pieces sound simpler than anybody else - a good thing because it's a sure sign he's making them a unity rather than a more-or-less miscellaneous collection of phrases and sections. This is especially true of some of the longer and more involved works: the Ballade No.1, for instance, regularly sounds as if the performer has pulled out the guns too early as they start banging away with abandon on the first climax only to make the remaining five minutes or so sound messy and anti-climactic. Rubinstein, by contrast, opens in highly poetic mode as if it's one of the Nocturnes, holds back on the first climax, but then builds and builds the piece, makes the presto section a natural outgrowth of the rest of the piece rather than sounding tacked-on, and gives the final chords a sense of apocalyptic inevitability that eludes almost every rival performance I've heard.    And it's this sense of inevitability that distinguishes almost every one of these performances: that, and the singing line Rubinstein constantly conjures out of the piano. The \\"Bel Canto\\" aspect is especially true of the Nocturnes and Waltzes but just try the middle-sections of the Scherzos, the 1st Piano Concerto, the Sonata No.2, to hear how Rubinstein excels in the cantabile aspect so important to this composer. You will \\"get\\" the melodies easily, even in the pieces you may be unfamiliar with. In fact, the best measure of a performance may be how quickly you learn the music from it. A bad performance has you listening numerous times to get the music but with Rubinstein a couple of listens is all you require.    The sound, likewise, is mostly treasurable. Sure, it's dated but the slight overlay of RCA 60's brittleness doesn't spoil the underlying velvety airiness of the sound. It \\"floats\\" and whispers. I find it more suited to Chopin than almost every modern recording I know.    Caveats? Disc 11, comprising recordings from 1946 of the Preludes, the Sonata No.2, the Barcarolle, and the Berceuse, is more a historical curiosity than a real musical experience (the clattery sound doing more damage to Chopin than any other composer) and the Etudes aren't here. For an almost-complete Chopin, you'll need outside performances of the Preludes and Etudes (I recommend Ashkenazy), but apart from those puzzling omissions (why didn't he record these glorious works in stereo?), this collection is just about everything you could ask for. It's as perfect a box-set as I've ever heard.

Because it's motivating, it's inspirational and you always read something you missed the first time around - and this book is worth the time - yes, even twice! It gives usable, practical advice and it provides a real blueprint anyone can follow.    Lots of books of this genre make me feel tired, they overwhelm. Sure they might contain good information, but you feel like you need a lifetime to implement the ideas, or more experience than you already have, or both! Not Crush It! I've shared it with some 'non-business' family members who have gotten totally jazzed by the possibilities. That speaks volumes to me.     Gary makes a great case for building your brand, whether you own a business, are starting a business or planning to stay an employee. I think he's right on target about how the internet is changing the way we work. I also believe, like he does, that we'll wake up 3 or 5 or 7 years from now and wonder how we missed the boat if we don't build our brands right now. We don't even know yet how profoundly our lives are being changed by the internet.     What I love about Crush It! is that it's empowering, it's concise, it's to-the-point, it's information you can use right now. It's simple and straightforward and very accessible.

030726999X|5.0|Title  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest<br />Author  Stieg Larsson<br />Rating  *****<br />Tags  mystery, series, stockholm, sweden, lisbeth salandar, mikael blomkvist, abuse, computers, hackers, espionage<br /><br /> I'm reviewing the Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest together because they are basically one long book. They are the second and the third books in Stieg Larsson's trilogy that began with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />Larsson was a master weaver of a storyteller, which makes the thought of his death and that he will weave stories no more a terrible one. It is hard to know how to review his books, because the stories build, plot layer upon plot layer, to create a complex whole that the author never loses control of. One doesn't want to reveal too much as it would lessen the impact each part of the plot has on the reader.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire reveals the story of Lisbeth Salander's past, how and why she was abused. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the story of the powerful people who want Salander either dead or in a place where no one will believe her story, and of the opposing group of people racing to expose the first group before they succeed in what they want to do to Lisbeth.<br /><br />Some people have accused the trilogy of gratuitous violence against women. I disagree. First, the abuse is believable... we hear of equally bad stories in the news far too often. Secondly, Larsson tells the abuse but does not dwell on its details. And thirdly, it is the abuse that creates the character of Lisbeth Salandar, and she is one of the most fascinating characters to emerge in this still young century.<br /><br />Now that all three books are out, I recommend you get all three and read them in a marathon reading session. You won't want to put them down.<br /><br />Publication  Knopf (2010), Hardcover, 576 pages<br />Publication date  2010<br />ISBN  030726999X / 9780307269997

If you've been living under a rock for the last couple of years, you might be forgiven for never having heard one of the most oft repeated terms in our modern lexicon for giving it all you've got..... \\"CRUSH IT\\".     Gary Vaynerchuk speaks his mind - and oh, what a mind he's got - about having passion... for everything you do in life. I wouldn't dare spoil the experience for you as a reader, other than to say... if you're alive and breathing, you can't help but be affected profoundly by this man's passion for life....and how his biggest hope is for YOU to get it too.     This book has more than a little bit to say about living and if you REALLY get it, you'll see that Gary not only has it, but he's willing to share to share this sip of the elixir of life - \\"PASSION\\" - with you.

My resume is solid, my professional network is strong, I try to keep up on the latest and greatest developments of how businesses are thriving in tough environments, and I've read a lot of books on business and how to be more effective.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the bad reviews for this book, take this one big truth into consideration:  No matter how hard anyone tries to do anything, they can't please everyone all the time... and there are some people that you can't please ANY of the time regardless of your effort.<br /><br />My experience of this book is that this is a 4.5 out of 5 star book, with the audio version being 5 out of 5 stars for its additional entertainment value, it's addition off-the-script content, and the fact that it is very affordable.<br /><br />The 1 and 2 star reviews I read here all mentioned the author's lack of writing ability.  The funny thing about this is that the author openly admitted in a recent interview I happened to see that he is HORRIBLE at writing.  He said he was BAD at grammar, BAD at spelling, BAD at punctuation, and that if he would not have had the services of a very talented editor to transcribe and fix the book that he audio recorded into a microphone... this book would have never come into being.<br /><br />So if you're concerned about the bad reviews, and are concerned that all the 5 start reviews are simply SuperFans trying to support him, here's my advice:<br /><br />First, from the perspective of being a business professional who doesn't know Gary... nor am I a big fan of wine... I think it's a great book.  As a business professional, I found it very inspiring and insightful, and personally from a business perspective, I am thankful that one of the early success stories in the social media realm stopped to share some secrets with us on how he became so successful, and how we might be able to follow in his footsteps.<br /><br />Second, just to be safe, maybe you should check out the audiobook form of Crush It, as read by the author, and listen to it on an iPod or through your computer.  If people don't like his writing style, it is evident that he's been able to build an empire on his speaking style.<br /><br />Hope this helps.fe, maybe you should check out the audiobook form of Crush It, as read by the author, and listen to it on an iPod or through your computer.

The former film were originally planned to be a drama, but turned a complete different direction when the dramatic parts didn't worked and the result turned out to be a somewhat bizarre and frenetic film. But still it felt as a breath of fresh air and became a highly entertaining experience. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for «Chicken Little». Although this film is also a frenetic comedy, it lacks the spunk and the freshness of it's predecessor and it's overall more flawed.    «Chicken Little» isn't a terrible film, but its potential is wasted. The film has its moments, but could been a whole lot better if some structure were put into the screenplay. The film's first twenty minutes or so are it's best one. This movie begins as relatively cute and charming story, with along some amusing pop references.    Unfortunately, the good things doesn't overcome the bad things in «Chicken Little». The thin screenplay isn't its worst problem. The several action sequences are terribly frenetic and hyperactive, accompained with the boisterous score by John Debney. His score works best on the calmer parts, but completely fails on the more adventurous sequences. The emotional moments in the film feels forced and completely sentimental and despite the film brings out a few laughs, there are some akward moments as well.    The pop and movie references is what ultimately makes the film, along with a passable and actually quite inspiring moral. The characters are quite passable, making Abby Mallard (voiced by Joan Cusack) the strongest and most likeable of the cast. The rest of the voice actors delivers a decent efforts, without being particularly memorable (although Zac Braff's as Chicken Little himself is distinctive). Animation-wise, the film is good looking, but isn't as lush and detailed compared to Dreamwork'sand Pixar's works.     The blu ray offers a excellent picture, along with informative audio commentary. So the hardcore fans should certainly check the blu ray edition out.
B002N8A14M|5.0|The arm band and case are excellent, actually the case is just as good as any other of the hard case's you can buy on here.  I actually bought a separate hard case that I didn't need as the case that comes with the arm band is so good.  My only negative thing is my outdoor speaker connection does not quite fit all the way into the output jack, but all my other connections do, headphones etc......
0553577123|5.0|This book is even better than I remeber from the readers in elementary school.It was perfect for my homeschooler, because it was thorough and had historically correct pictures. I would refer this as an age appropiate reader for anyone interested.
0393072231|5.0|Having just read \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\", an excellent account focused primarily on the killing John Paulson made buying credit default swaps on sub-prime bonds, I was reluctant to buy \\"The Big Short\\", thinking it might be a replay of the first book. I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did.  While there is some overlap between the books, Lewis is a fantastic storyteller and he focuses on some other interesting characters as well. Lewis also does a great job of giving you an insider's look at Wall Street (and it sure isn't pretty). This book reads like a non-fiction novel and the pages just flew by.  Highly informing and entertaining.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I've had the range finder for about 2 weeks now and I have no complaints. It is fast and easy to use. The pinseeker option is neat but I only use it half the time. Most of the time I can get a lock on the flag without it. I'm 30 years old and a 15 handicap. I highly recomend the Tour v2. Don't bother getting a \\"skinz\\" for it though. They are worthless.
0061914177|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo19XB8IPXVKUKO]]So now I've read the book and \\"Whoa, what a powerful book!\\"<br /><br />The basic message of the book is: with the new media available thanks to the Internet, anyone can create their own, personal brand and \\"crush it\\", but only if they work hard and focus on something they're very passionate about.<br /><br />My quick take is there are six parts to the book. I like 'em all, but I like the fourth part best.<br /><br />Part One - Sell 'em - Get people pumped, get out the messages about loving family, working hard, living passions and combining the last two. Makes the points about social media, personal branding.<br /><br />Part Two - Teach 'em - Major social media and new media Internet platforms, why and how, gives examples.<br /><br />Part Three - Make it personal - More about branding. Why you should, how you can, and what it will mean personally.<br /><br />Part Four - Bigger messages - What it really means on this planet and to you!<br /><br />Part Five - Blueprint - Take it and do this on your own. You can and you should, but if you don't, don't come crying.<br /><br />Part Six - Gifts - Some examples of possible fields in which to \\"crush it\\" that if you don't at least check them out a little, you really don't get it (cuz subject doesn't matter, it's the medium and the method, silly).<br /><br />This book rocks.<br /><br />Bruce Brown<br />[...]
0385341008|4.0|With the non-traditional approach of this novel which is written in a series of letters, it took some work to keep track of the characters and figure out their relation to one another. However, after putting the pieces together, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society turned out to be a heartwarming story of a group of individuals who pull together during the toughest of times to support one another.  Their outlet and forum is a book club.  There were multiple story lines throughout, but the one that was most touching and memorable for me was the adoption that takes place.  The unbreakable bond that formed between two non-biological individuals was truly touching.  Overall, this is a quick read that's well worth every minute.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I have been hearing about the Bourne movies for a long time now but I am just getting around to watching them now.<br />I'll make this short as there are already over six hundred reviews for this movie.<br /><br />The good?<br />Great acting, directing, plot, script....pretty much everything was done well.<br />The pacing was perfect also.<br /><br />The bad?<br />I didn't care for the corny, tacked on ending.<br />That's it.<br />Was that short enough for ya? lol.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity comes...<br />Highly Recommended.
B002UZ3M8U|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first based on the unusual cover art, but this album turned out to be one of my favorites of 2009. Its not your run of the mill pop album though, so if you're into more radio-friendly stuff, this might not be your cup of tea -- however, it is incredible. Great for spring and summer listening while driving in the car. Definitely a feel good record, with some Queen influence, and some similarities to the British pop star Mika... very layered sound scape, and very well recorded (unlike so many albums these days). Get it while you can for five bucks here on Amazon.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|In the year 1982 in a Swedish town, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a lonely bullied 12 year old boy who wants anything for revenge on the local punk kids that harrass him. A young 12 year old girl named Eli (Lina Leanderson) and so called father Haken (Per Ragner) move in next door, it seems he has found an answer to his sollutions. His parents Erik and Vyonne (Henrik Dahl and Karin Bergquist) are having some problems but Oskar seems to be the one with the most problems with some other kids picking on him at school and in town, however murders have been occuring over the last days since Eli and Haken moved next year. Later Eli reveals herself to be some sort of vampire that feeds off the blood at night and has remained 12 for 200 years as Oskar doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />A brilliant work of art! this Swedish import is a gory and romantic horror drama vampire movie that is based on a popular Swedish novel. This is one of those rare vampire movies without the use of fangs or some of the Dracula mentality yet they can still be burnt by the sun and there is gore around here. The love story works here because they are 2 preteens who have little in common yet they find their love to be a little forbidden yet almost in a sexual way, there is even a hint that Eli may or may not be a girl which is subtle but this is one of the most original yet unique works of cinematic art in recent memory. Came out in the year of the vampire 2008 where stuff like Vampire Diaries, Twilight and True Blood came out, this one just picked a right time to come out and is one of the must see movies ever.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives viewers the authentic theatrical feel even with it's sweet surround sound in Swedish with english subtitles and even a very nice English dub track. The extras are few such as deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, and photo & Theatrical poster galleries. A must have for vampire and horror movie fans, but i can't believe an American made remake comes out this year but on the other hand it's produced by Hammmer, so that shouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Fright Night 1 & 2\\", \\"The Lost Boys\\", \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", \\"Vamp\\", \\"The Hunger\\", \\"Martin\\", \\"Dracula (Any version including 1931, 1979, Bram Stoker's and Hammer)\\", \\"Nosferatu (1922 and 1979 versions)\\", \\"Twilight Saga\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"Def By Tempation\\", \\"Count Yorga\\", \\"Thirst (Korean 2008)\\", \\"The Vampire Lovers\\", \\"Vampire's Kiss\\", \\"Salem's Lot (1979 and 2004)\\", \\"Nosferatu (1922 and 1979)\\", \\"Habit\\", \\"Immortality (a.k.a.

B002VECM6S|2.0|...Or the small screen, now. And aside from the higher production values, I think you could easily mistake it for a Lifetime movie. It's a film that does exactly what you expect, exactly how you'd expect. It doesn't take any risks or make you feel for the characters. The fact that it's a true story doesn't change the fact that it's almost entirely without passion.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the impression it made on me, when my aunt and I went to see it in the theater, we left the theater, got in the car, drove all the way to the restaurant, and already had our menus out before either of us commented on the movie.<br /><br />If you want to watch a football movie about overcoming the odds, try Rudy or Remember the Titans. The latter deals with many of the same issues as Blind Side, but has many genuine surprises along the way, great humor and, yeah, it is a real tearjerker, because you care about the characters. Something you don't really end up doing in this movie. The Tuohy family is just too dull, and we see so little of Michael. I complained about the kids in Gran Torino not being real characters, but means for Clint Eastwood's character's redemption. Surprise, Michael seems to be in this movie for the same reason, except substitute Clint Eastwood with Sandra Bullock. Talk about depressing!
B00328G4V6|5.0|It may be true that it's not the best from the man, but he's been gone for a long, long time. To get some new (to us) stuff after almost 40 years is worth a 5 to me, even flawed.  I wasn't a fan when he first came out until I saw him live at Chicago's Auditorium Theater. Then I understood what others had been telling me. Personally, this cut of Red House, even with the abrupt fadeout, was worth the price alone.  Enough other nice cuts, new to me, to make me happy. I wish he was still around playing mostly blues for us.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Loved it! Neal was great. I watched it on Netflix and I have to own it. Joss Whedon is a genius of a director. For those who don't know, he did Firefly and Dollhouse, among others, and although Dr. Horrible is wholly different, it has his unique signature running through it. This musical vaguely reminds me of the writings of Douglas Adams. Give it a chance.

B00005JKWJ|4.0|BLADE 2 kicks off shortly following the events of the original, this time teaming The Daywalker with a unit of highly trained vampire mercenaries who have enlisted his aid in order to destroy a common foe. These mutant \\"Reapers\\" are an evolved breed of vampires that hunt both humans and bloodsuckers alike, posing a huge threat to both species. Guillermo Del Toro steps in for Stephen Norrington this round, bringing with him a slicker look, even more fast-paced action, and a ton of bloody gore. Goyer has also eliminated the cheesier elements and over the top dialog that bogged down his first script. The success of the original allowed for a greatly expanded budget, which Del Toro has poured in to the elaborate set designs and improved FX. The Reapers benefit most from these upgrades, possessing excellent make-up work that crosses the eerie rat-like features of Max Schreck's Count Orlok with the deadly mandibles of The Predator. BLADE 2 is one of the rare series sequels that outdoes the original on every level, making it the strongest of the three films.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000068FXR|5.0|It just breaks my heart that so many remasters cater to the inferior dynamics of mp3 when a physical redbook compact disc is capable of so much more.  And this is exactly what I hear when I listen to the remastered versions of [[ASIN:B000068FY0 Crime of the Century]], [[ASIN:B000068FXX Even in the Quietest Moments]], and [[ASIN:B000068FWC Breakfast in America]].  It's as if the remastering engineers have completely removed the low and even the mid-bass frequencies and then manipulated the remaining upper bass frequencies to create the illusion that the full audible spectrum is still present.  And that's fine for those consumers who enjoy their music on portable players or while driving since those playback devices are generally incapable of reproducing the missing low and mid-bass, but it is really, really frustrating to people like myself who have assembled home systems for the sole purpose of representing the full audible spectrum.  Thankfully, I can take some solace in the fact that \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" appears to have dodged this all too common marketing bullet.  (Note to the powers that be: If you want to capitalize on the music download market, then, at the very least, understand that an mp3 is a completely different product from a redbook compact disc!)<br /><br />\\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\" is probably Supertramp's most underated album.  My guess is that it just didn't take with most casual fans, and the downside of riding the crest of a big hit like \\"Crime of the Century\\" is that you accummulate a lot of casual fans who, quite innocently, cannot fathom where an artist actually came from in the first place.  Because there are few, if any, big hits on this album, it typically gets unfairly dismissed.  I mean, this album has one of the most intriguing openings, [[ASIN:B000V638HA Easy Does It]],  of any album I have _ever_ heard and that's coming from a huge fan of The Alan Parsons Project who were renown for striking overtures!<br /><br />A close listening will reveal all manner of melody in songs like [[ASIN:B000V638K2 Lady]] and [[ASIN:B000V654LS Sister Moonshine]], deft musicianship in [[ASIN:B000V6950O Poor Boy]] and [[ASIN:B000V6AAFS The Meaning]], and stellar production choices in the epic [[ASIN:B000V694YG A Soapbox Opera]], but just not the sort of thing one would typically hear on commercial radio.  Because it is so atmospheric at times, perhaps much of this music behaves more like a movie soundtrack than a typical rock, even progressive rock, album.<br /><br />But the botton line is this: if you like Supertramp in general, then give Crisis a good second look.  Like [[ASIN:B000069HJN Brother Where You Bound]], Crisis is part of the essential Supertramp cannon.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|Pick up the David Attenborough version; not this one! It is hard to understand the BBC's decision to release an inferior version, using Oprah's narration, for the American market. I can't fathom the reason for replacing a renowned naturalist with a fantastic narration style with a middling TV host.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I hate when fans of the first get super elitist and deny the sequel it's proper credit.  I find it hard to believe that you can be a fan of the first and NOT of the second.  It has all the amazing qualities that made the first one such a great one.  I found it even more hilarious than the first one because of the all the allusions to the first movie.  There was no skimping on the action and it kinda reminds me of The Godfather II in how it traces back to the origins of their family history.  All in all, I was immensely satisfied after waiting for 10 years, and simply can't wait for the third in the series!
0061914177|5.0|I have both a hardcopy and an audio version of this book. Yes, Gary did ask those who had read his book to head over to Amazon and leave an HONEST review of his book, so that is what I'm doing.    It is not surprising that the reviews are so diametrically opposed and the reactions so vehement when the subject matter is a book about passion and the author has the type of personality that has a polarizing effect on people. He's a \\"love him or hate him\\" kind of guy. Fortunately, he's also pretty sensitive and doesn't have the \\"take no prisoners\\" attitude you might expect. For that reason I'm willing to grant his request and give my opinion.    What really works about this book is that it's formatted into stories. What might be bland and arrogant becomes very palatable and entertaining. Gary's approach doesn't come across to me as self-centered. The point is that it's experienced-based. His openness about what worked for him and what didn't, coupled with his realistic views about how his experience may or may not apply to his readers, felt very authentic.    I appreciated this book immensely. It felt like a gift and I found it very inspiring and was able to take away several ideas that I felt applied to my business. There were things I agreed with and things that I didn't, but I felt the author was more than authoritative in the positions he took. I haven't yet found a cookbook for success and I didn't expect to find one here. What I did find was delightful, personable, and genuinely helpful.

159102594X|4.0|Logen Ninefingers is the toughest, baddest fighter in all of the North, the kind of stone-cold killer who could eat Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone for breakfast, and still have room for Arnold Schwarzenegger for desert. When we first meet him, he's doing what he does best: killing things. Of course, like all action heroes, he cracks wise as he breaks heads; his first lines are, \\"(deleted by amazon.com)\\", followed by \\"Gah!\\", \\"Hah\\", \\"(deleted by amazon.com)\\" yet again, then \\"Aaargh!\\". Ah, such poetry. He whimpers, grunts, squeals, then falls off a cliff.<br /><br />He what?<br /><br />Yes, the heroes of \\"The Blade Itself\\", by British author Joe Abercrombie, are not what you expect. It's as though Mr Abercrombie has taken well-worn archetypes of fantasy and swords & sorcery, the Tough Barbarian, the Wise Wizard, the Young Gallant, the Cynical Veteran, the Damsel in Distress, placed them lovingly on a pedestal, bowed deeply before them, then cut their throats, ripped out their entrails and set them on fire. Rarely have such genre clich&eacute;s been deconstructed with such &eacute;lan and obvious glee.<br /><br />Gritty, dark fantasy seems to have enjoyed a surge in popularity over the past decade, boosted by authors such as George R R Martin, Stevan Erikson and Scott Bakker. Their heroes are anything but heroic, sometimes die, and frequently swear. Of course, there's an inherent contradiction in trying to write a \\"realistic\\" fantasy, and all too often such stories become a race to the lowest, pimpley-est of adolescent common denominators, stuffed with blood, gore, swearing and sex. \\"The Blade Itself\\" neatly avoids these pitfalls. The charm of Mr Abercrombie's work is that he manages to wallow in the mud without getting dirty. He remembers fantasy is, above all, supposed to be fun.<br /><br />Mr Abercrombie has a rare talent for sketching vivid personalities in just a few strokes. His characters may be more memorable than believable, but always sympathetic. Take Logen, for starters. You'll never have such a soft spot for such a hard lump of a man. He's lost his family, his friends and his axe - now all he has for company is a cooking pot. Mr Abercrombie deftly portrays him as a worn nub of a man, tired from years of fighting, who could still snap you in two if he had a mind to.<br /><br />His fall from the cliff is not the end, and eventually he falls in with Bayaz, a man who claims to be the First of the Magi. Unlike most Wise Wizards, he's not much of a one for fireside wisdom and heartwarming homilies. Waving magic wands and speaking pig-Latin doesn't appear on his \\"To Do\\" list, either. The Darth Vader neck-crushing thing is more Bayaz's speed, when he's not making people spontaneously explode, like Tetsuo in \\"Akira\\".<br /><br />Bayaz brings Logen to the city of Adua, the capital of a massive but decrepit, patchwork kingdom called the Union. There, they cross paths with Jezal dan Luthar, a dashing and dishy young swordsman callow to the point of almost mental incapacity, and Inquisitor Glokta, a torturer with unique insights into his job thanks to two years spent in the dungeons of the Union's enemies. He walks with a limp, climbs stairs with reluctance, is missing half his teeth but none of his wits. You feel sorry for him, when he's not cutting people's fingers off.<br /><br />There are plenty of fingers in line for the chop, as the Union is beset by enemies within and without, real as well as imagined. People claiming to be powerful wizards go right to the top of the inquisition's Suspicious People list, and Glokta is put on the case of finding out whether the old man really is who he claims to be. In this, he's aided by two thuggish helpers, an ex-criminal and a giant, near-mute albino, who naturally gets one of the novel's best lines.<br /><br />There also are a number of minor stories, each packed with equally quirky characters. The requisite Damsel in Distress is Ferro Maljinn, an escaped slave and, incidentally, aferal, evil spirit of a woman, madder than a pit bull on drugs. When offered salvation, her first instinct is to stab her rescuer. Other interwoven lines follow dour Major West and his hard-drinking sister, and a band of northern outlaws with colorful names like Dogman and Threetrees.<br /><br />As the first book of a trilogy, much of \\"The Blade Itself\\" is spent on stage-setting and world-building. You get the sense of forces gathering, like mountaineers under a snow shelf after someone says, \\"Atchoo\\". The aims and motives of the protagonists remain mostly shrouded, and the overarching mythology is revealed in teasingly brief glimpses. The action is therefore episodic rather than epic. Some readers may be put off by the slow plot development, but although small-scale, the fights are never less than electric in intensity. It all builds nicely to a climactic, crimson scene where we learn why Logen Ninefingers is also known as \\"The Bloody-Nine.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Blade Itself\\" is stripped-down fantasy, anarchic and endless fun to read, Monty Python does Conan the Barbarian, with Jason Bourne in the lead. It is not an Important Book, it won't change your life, just give you a few hours of genuine pleasure. You'll whimper, grunt, and perhaps even squeal with laughter.

0061914177|5.0|I purchased the audio book of Gary Vaynerchuk's \\"Crush-It\\" and I have to honestly admit I was left very empowered and motivated from it. I had read another review of this book, and I will say that everyone is entitled to their opinions. I certainly didn't come away thinking that Mr. Vaynerchuk was a 'Poor Little Rich Boy\\". His family came to this country with nothing, and they built their business with hard work and determination.    I was very inspired by his story of selling baseball cards. I remember at 14 wanting an Atari 2600 game system so badly and my parents couldn't afford it. I worked my tail off all summer to earn the money to pay for it. For that, I could easily relate to his story as a youth trying to make money. Mr. Vaynerchuk's book won't promise you a rose garden. Heck, it won't even guarantee you'll make a dime. What it promises is that if you follow your dreams, your passions, and you work insanely hard for it, there's no reason you can't accomplish anything. If more people did that, we would be in a much better place. I for one, with the help of his book for motivation, am sure going to try.
0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk is a passionate and inspirational speaker. His success is a direct result of two things: hard work (hustle) and passion. Both shine through when you hear him speak and when you read his book. This book is not going to tell you anything revolutionary in the realm of online tools to drive your business (or your personal brand) . What's important here is the message and what you can take from it. The inspiration, the drive it can create in you, is well worth your money. A quick and entertaining read that you won't regret.
0061914177|5.0|Gary really CRUSHED IT! with this book. I will be honest this book is going to change the way you think about working and getting a job the moment you finish reading it.<br /><br />I was so hooked I read it in 7 hours straight. Gary is super pumped up when he is talking to you through these words its like he is reading your mind. You won't be able to stop reading and you will want to let go of the book just to get moving on all the content that he is throwing at you. You can really feel his passion in this book and nobody ever is going to care more than this guy. Of all the business books I've read besides Seth Godin's books I think this is a great book for the buck.<br /><br />Go get this book and visit his blog he really rocks, he will talk to you on twitter and even answer your emails. What celebrity do you know that does that?
B001GQ3DXS|5.0|I have to say I heartily disagree with the negative reviews of this book. I loved the initial courtship and subsequent retelling of the original from Capt. Wentworth's viewpoint. I think his character is much more developed and I felt that my understanding of Anne's character was deepened, as well. It made me think of how a person's behavior can radically alter when they experience heart break. I think Grange gets the language just right (or right enough that it doesn't distract me from enjoying the book.) She didn't violate any of my feelings about the characters from the original work, but she added dimensions that were not fleshed out by Austen. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are a fan of Persuasion. Another thing I really liked? Grange didn't delve into salacious descriptions of sex or anything else Austen would have never done. ENJOY!
0061537934|5.0|Since I reached 50, I don't read novels; however, on a road trip across the country, my wife and I listened to a CD of 'Racing in the rain' and were transported into the canine brain.    As you may know, the dog has olfactory lobes occupying a long third of their brain (4x+ the human ratio).  For this reason we often have real problems connecting with the actions of our friends with the long noses.  Garth Stein has definitely made the connection!    A must read and an uplifting religious experience combined!    Tom, DVM, PhD, professor emeritus in comparative pathology
B0026IBY72|4.0|I'll start by telling you that I'm a Jane Austen fanatic. I love her characters, dialogue and happy endings. What can I say? I'm a sucker for that stuff. This book has ALL that stuff. None of the writing rises to the level of Austen, but I don't think it's trying to. It is a modern story about a woman, like me, who really loves Jane Austen & Mr. Darcy and has trouble (sometimes) reconciling that world with the reality that is presented to her. I'm a spinster, I admit it. My heart goes pitter pat when I read this kind of fluffy happiness junk, so maybe you shouldn't go by me. BUT, if you like a quick, fun, Austen-themed read - this one's for you. It's also PG, so if you (like me) don't like Austen stuff with gratuitous sex inserted, this one's also for you. Enjoy!
B002RSDW80|3.0|A while back I found a free Red Box rental code, and a lot of my friends had posted on Facebook how much they loved this movie, or that they were going to or had watched it.  It looked like such a fun movie that I just grabbed it.  Honestly, I'm really picky about movies, and I feel that there can be some difference in opinion on what is ok for someone to watch. So, if you don't agree with me, sorry, this is just my opinion, and I'm not saying you are wrong if you think differently than me.       Now, I know that sounds like I don't like Julie and Julia.  I  did enjoy it, and thought it was very cute, but I had a few problems with some of the things I saw/heard.   I loved that both gals were married, stayed married and never had affairs and were happy!! For Hollywood to actually make a movie like that surprised me a bit.  definitely a good thing.  I like how `real' the movie seemed by showing some of the rough parts of marriage and how they worked through it.  I think movies have a tendency to say marriage is either terrible or wonderful, but rarely does it show the in-between which is where most marriages are.     My problems with the movie: Language and partial nudity.  I know that a lot of people probably didn't/don't have a problem with the amount that is in this movie, but for me it was too much.  I know that this is a `real' story, so if that's the way they talked, then some people would say it  'should' be in the movie. I feel that watching people making out, half-dressed is inappropriate for people to see.   Really the language and make out scenes were just unnessisary and didn't add to the quality of the movie.    PluggedIn is an online review site that tells you exactly what words are in movies and how many times it was spoken, and can be a great source before you watch a movie.  ( I had read it before I watched this, but then it was so long before I rented it that I forgot  )      I think that Julie and Julia had great potential for being an awesome movie, but there was enough stuff in it that I probably won't watch it again.

B0008ENIAC|4.0|I liked this film a lot more before I read Cain's book, which is subtle and ironic in ways this movie can't match. In fact, having just read the book and just seen the movie, I'd have to say that this is a rather corny flick in a number of ways, and nowhere near as fine as Cain's superlative novel.<br /><br />There are indeed a number of fine performances here---Blyth, Arden, and Carson all deliver the goods---but even then only Carson comes close to drawing his character as finely as Cain does. Blyth is suitably painful but not as sharp as the truly hateful Veda in the book, and Arden's perfect foil to Crawford gets a mere few minutes here instead of the major part the novel gives to Ida. Sure, the book isn't hampered by a two-hour limit, but there are some choices made by the three screenwriters (including William Faulkner, a long way from Yoknapatawpha here) that just don't make much sense compared to Cain's original and much less Hollywood plot.<br /><br />{Spoilers aplenty on the way:} For instance, the ending is laughable next to the book's. Here of course we must have some sort of \\"justice\\", contrived though it may be, whereas Cain made the completely realistic yet ugly choice of Veda getting away with it all. And of course the murder is the central plot device of the film, yet nobody is killed in the book, much to the benefit of both plot and characters. The murder here takes away from much of the power of the original plot, and as far as film noir murders go, it's weak. And calling this one of the great film noirs is way off the mark: The Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, DOA and so many others are real noir with real grit; this is all too Hollywood and really not very noir at all, with its slick ending and refusal to confront most of the moral questions raised by Cain. It may be shot with noirish angles and lighting, but that doesn't make it hardboiled. In fact, of the three Cain novels put to film in the '40s, this is the least successful to my eyes and ears; Indemnity and Postman both feature sharper dialogue and better lead performances than Pierce.<br /><br />Uh oh, now I'm getting close to saying what seems to be anathema to the many worshippers of this film, which I tried to deny to myself for a while while rewatching it tonight for the first time in over a decade: Joan Crawford is a mediocre actress. There, I said it. Sorry, but she's wearing almost the same expression in every scene here: eyes wide open in shock/dismay/anger/joy/insert emotion here. Watch Arden and Crawford at work and then watch Joan: they bring subtlety and nuance to their portrayals, where Joan brings only an almost robotic feel to bear on myriad emotions. But then it seemed like she was more concerned with which hat to wear than how to honor Cain's incredibly complex Mildred with a similarly considered performance.<br /><br />She just hams it up over and over, or does the opposite, standing in blank dismay and letting her wardrobe do the acting. Curtiz' fine direction and Steiner's typically solid score lift the film onto a refined plane, and Crawford is in her way perfect here in her many imperfections; she has presence, to be sure, but she's just not a very convincing actress. Cain's Mildred has so much more intelligence and drive and verve and grace and wit than Crawford can begin to bring to this role, and that made it all feel rather empty for me.<br /><br />But I know that leaves me in the vast minority, so maybe I'm just missing her genius. Still, I'd recommend reading the book and then seeing this again to all who find Joan the perfect Mildred Pierce. I think in fact that Arden could have done a vastly superior job as Mildred; she can really act, while Joan can really only be Joan. And while that's a spectacle worth watching, it comes nowhere near the quality of Cain's heroine.<br /><br />The dvd does feature an excellent transfer, plus a decent doc on Crawford's life, and is wisely two-sided, which was common a few years ago until studios realized they could use two discs instead and milk the consumer for more cash. It's a nice little package and must be a delight for huge fans of this film; I too would have called myself one until reading the book. I still like the movie for its various qualities, but can't ignore its many flaws when held up to Cain's masterpiece.wo discs instead and milk the consumer for more cash.

0061914177|5.0|Most people do not think about what they love to do, especially not when it comes to their job or profession. Gary is a SUPREME motivator who will get you off of your seat and moving towards having a great life and work. I have the book AND the audible version and both are well used. When I am getting ready to go into a prospect and need a little push, I just read or listen to a little bit and I am ready to take on the world. This book is on my Top Ten business books ever, up there with my favorites from Malcolm Gladwell and Seth Godin!
0061914177|5.0|This is the best business book I have read since the Four Hour Work Week. Gary is a fantastic business development voice and seems like a really decent human being. The book's focus is social media and how it relates to the future of business. He paints a very accurate picture of where things are going with business in a way that I have not read anywhere else. It's perhaps so inspiring because it suggests that we are at the dawn of a new era in capitalism where the internet is leveling the playing field and allowing content and quality to win over what has traditionally been a market place dominated by the size of your advertising budget. Sorry to gush, but I really loved this book and give it my highest recommendation.
B00005JOHC|5.0|\\"Two and a Half Men: The Complete First Season\\"; is the best sitcom on TV today. It is full of humor and great acting. I purchased all six season on a Friday sale (thank you Amazon). I hope to get season seven when it is out.    This is a true ensemble cast.  It has many guest charters to add to the humor. I highly recommend these DVD's.
B00026WU4G|5.0|Infidels is one of my favorite albums by Dylan, I and I being one of the most fantastic songs on the album or on any of his albums, a true masterpiece. You will enjoy this album if you are a fan of Dylan's work.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is not only a great album to listen to, it is really fun, worthwhile, enjoyable, and to dance to the rhythm of the tracks of the album itself. This really is the kind of CD i would highly recommend to anyone who loves Michael as much as I do when it comes to listening to his music. Also, the more i listen to the songs the more i like the music itself. It is not just his voice, it is the musical background also as well. I wanted to say more about this album, mostly because i happen to be one of the fanatics who just cannot get enough of his music.  He will be remembered as the KING OF POP, but also I will always love his music!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I was very hesitant to watch it.--when movies get panned I watch them to see how wrong the critics are. When they receive dozens of accolades, I fear to watch them because I will be let down:} I wasn't let down, at all. Beautiful direction. Lovely cinematography. Solid supporting cast.Tim McGraw in a quiet role was extremely good. The coach of the high school football team did an excellent job.<br />The script was smart and didn't get too treacly.<br />Sandra was not comedic Sandra at all.<br />Excellent performance. Not really a broad performance. Very contained, as this woman Leann must be. Which I would think would be more difficult to play than broad and big. Ya know? I cried and laughed. Very satisfying.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This is the second album, of course most of the songs are great. What i love about this album is that it is a real great album and all the songs are awesome. 'Billie Jean' 'Beat it' and of course 'Thriller' are the most memorable ones. Also the songs are well written, not to mention that Michael did work really hard on this album for quite sometime, this is a keepsake to keep and not to let go of either.\\"  What i like about the music is that it is so familiar to listen to his voice and that is what i enjoy the most.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Carey Mulligan is an English schoolgirl in mid-60s London.  Meticulous in every way, this coming-of-age film makes poignant specific deceptions and desires that make us wiser or damage us forever.  Mulligan earned an Oscar© nomination.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I have been a huge fan of michael's for a long time as long as i can remember, and I purchased this CD at a store because i do know some songs on the album. This actually was his first album after he finished perfoming with his brothers, Randy, Tito, Jackie, Jermaine and Marlon. Mostly all the music tracks are songs that I would listen to a lot as kid, and still they are on the radio. I really love this album because some of the songs are so cool to listen to.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|Director Guy Ritchie shape-shifts the venerable British literary sleuth and his stodgy sidekick into edgy action heroes.  Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jude Law's knowingly over-the-top performances and the fine production design make this case worth investigating.
B002HREKCI|4.0|Jay Asher took a theme that seems to be popular right now and changed it from what could be grotesque to being a well written story with a very important underlying moral.  Kids are MEAN.  You never know how the words you say or actions you commit or DON'T say or do can effect someone's life.  I was really impressed by how the author fit the pieces together and how even though Clay was not mean to Hannah, he was changed for the better by the end of the book.  This would be a great book for teens to have to read followed by small group discussions in school or even church youth groups.
0061914177|5.0|I'm going to keep this simple, and brutally honest.<br /><br />I've been following Gary for some time now, and I knew that when this book came out he was going to have a lot of people say they loved it and say they got something out of it, and even more people hate on it. I'm honestly surprised that more have not managed to find their way here and leave a negative review yet.<br /><br />Here's the reality. There are tons of people that saw Gary do the WLTV bit, book himself on Conan and Ellen, land a massive book deal, then go on a speaking tour that rivaled most bands, and make all kinds of money in the process. Now that he's blown up, and has such a massive following, he's attracted a lot, and I do mean, a lot of people that want something for nothing, and think that the magic to what gave Gary his meteoric rise was Social Media. They are wrong. Gary's determination and work ethic gave Gary his meteoric rise. Social media was just a tool. It's easy to see what he's done and overlook that the guy straight outworked everybody.<br /><br />Gary may say that he has winning DNA that's helped him get to where he is. While I think that's a great way for him to pay homage to his parents, which he obviously adores, I think that's only a piece, and a small one at that. The guy knows what he wants, has developed the chops, and most importantly, is willing to do the work to get it done. The one thing I love about this book is that he does go through the mechanics of how to do it, but most importantly he's very honest about how much work goes into getting it done and starting to monetize. I think that this is extremely helpful for people that don't already have a vehicle in place to make something happen.<br /><br />If you have a big dream pounding in your chest and you are willing to do the work, then this book is definitely for you and you will be able to extract value out of it. Social Media is not my platform, but I did find Gary's honesty and passion to be refreshing and encouraging in my attempts to make something happen. If you are looking for a shortcut or a way to get rich quick, save yourself the cost of the book and some reading time, because you wont get any value out of it.<br /><br />Hope this helped.<br /><br />-=Gerardo Ritcheye something happen.

0545123267|5.0|I am MORE THEN HAPPY that I picked up this book.  There are several things that make a book good or bad.  Genre, style/formatting/, the story itself, and first and foremost (in my opinion)- storytelling.  This book does a good job in each of these areas.    Sam's story is good.  He is a caring and strong guy who is easy to fall for.  Grace is a really interesting girl, far from one dimensional.  The wording is graceful, fluent, and poetic.  I don't think you can ever go wrong with a WELL TOLD star-crossed lovers tale.  AND there are REASONS why these two characters have fallen for one another.  They aren't just thrown together to get a story sold to a mass market!  When I talk about my favorite Supernatural books, Twilight and Shiver are at the top of the list.  One of the GREAT things about this book is that the author didn't copycat Myer's boo, which seems to happen way too often in a lot of the other SN books and series I've read, she clearly told her own.   I borrowed this book from the library but I will be buying it as I know I'll want to read it again and again.  I EAGERLY look forward to the rest of this series and if this book is ANY indication of the author Maggie Stiefvater is, I can't wait to read more!!
0061914177|5.0|Gary's simple, transparent style was captured and what you read is what you get. There is NO SECRET, he had the hustle and passion to keep doing the simple things to build his business and that is what he wrote about. I don't think the intention of the book was a big SECRET to building a business. The point of the book was NOW, at this time in history, anyone can do it and you just have to have more moxy and juice than the next guy and want it more. I'm sure we will see more great things from him and I can't wait to get his next book! Just Crush It, AGAIN! GaryV
B00003CXB4|1.0|I was disappointed with The Lion King, since it is a copy of the original and not an authentic Disney DVD. I felt mislead by the description and I decided to return this immediately. The seller was very accomodating and cooperative, and I was issued a full refund.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It is an excellent abridged version of the classic Jane Austin book.  The filming is very well done, and the acting is good.  If you like Jane Austin's books you will love this movie.
0061914177|4.0|I haven't seen anything quite like Gary or his book since John Kennedy O'Toole.  It has a childlike sense of wonder and enough intelligence to make it connect with a broader audience.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll wonder what the hell he's talking about.  But mostly, this book will penetrate a part of you that you haven't had your hands on since you were a kid or before your first marriage.    I recommend this book and can't wait until his second book: Crushed By It.
0440236738|4.0|\\"Gone for Good\\" in another in Coben's series which turns out to be a great thriller dealing with finding a missing person.  The tragedies in Will Kleins life would beggar anyone's imagination and certainly challenge a normal person. But, Harlan handles it well and realistically.    Harlan takes a murder (his old girlfriend), two disappearances (his brother and his girlfriend), and the death of his mother in stride, and in a plot that has more twists and turns than normal.  However, it is all unravelled in the final chapters of a well constructed suspense novel.  It will keep you guessing until the end.    E.J. Walden, author of \\"Operation Snow Owl\\"
0385732554|5.0|This book is targeted to a \\"young adult\\" reader (junior high and upwards).  But at my age (considerably over 21 years old) I found it original, thought-provoking and to be a bit honest, a bit scary!<br /><br />I totally agree with the editors' reviews when they say that it's possible to get seduced into the quiet, orderly, apparently problem-free world presented here -- until we begin to see that all this order and apparent \\"peace\\" has some flaws -- and on further examination, the flaws become serious.  Jonas, the main character, begins to wonder even on his own, and when his community chooses him to be the \\"Rceiver of Memories,\\" his uneasiness becomes even greater, and he begins to wonder if the tranquility and order of his community comes with a price that he doesn't want to pay.<br /><br />There are many reviews here that give a summary of the book probably better than I could.  But I would like to add that Lois Lowry does a superb job of showing the problems that can come up in any society and she also shows that it's possible for dedicated truth-seeking individuals -- including young teens -- can make a difference.<br /><br />This book points out some of the problems that we encounter in George Orwell's book 1984 and the book BRAVE NEW WORLD, but on a level appropriate for young people to read as well as and \\"older kid\\" senior citizen like myself. I am impressed with the respect that Lois Lowry has for young people, because they most certainly CAN understand societal issues when presented in a form that they can relate to.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be spoiling it for you to say that this theme is continued in Lois Lowry's next two books in the series -- GATHERING BLUE and THE MESSENGER.
0061245097|5.0|Perfect follow-up to Halfway to the Grave. Frost hits exactly the right note by setting the sequel several years after the original. One Foot in the Grave sees Cat leading a ragtag team of vampire hunters under the auspices of the government. When hints that her former vampire lover is getting close to finding her crop up, it's only a matter of time until nitro meets glycerin. An amazing story and captivating read. My only complaints (minor spoilers) are an anal sex scene, and a vampire hearing the report of a gun firing in time to intercept the bullets. The former was a turn-off for me, the latter was a physical impossibility since a speeding bullet travels much faster than sound.    Otherwise, the sex was hot, the action was intense, and Cat and Bones provided a sizzling sun for everything to revolve around.
1407109421|5.0|This trilogy is fabulous!  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fantasy (timely messages) with which to spend some time.  It would be ideal summer reading for the strong-reader ten to twelve year-olds, and great for adults, but even a ten-year old would have to have a pretty sophisticated mentality.  I loved it.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|I read this very quickly on my Kindle based on the recommendations of two co-workers.  It was good but not the \\"great\\" they purported it to be.  After seeing the number of positive Amazon.com reviews I was expecting something unique and over-the-top.  Would I recommend it?  Don't know...another book I'll add to my \\"beach book\\" list for friends.
0061914177|5.0|I speak to local high schools and college's about Internet safety, security and personal branding. I always use Gary Vee as an example of how to do it RIGHT! I loved this book! I am extremely careful who I loan it to, as I don't want it off the shelve, even though I've read it twice. Gary has a great deal of explosive energy and passion - and this book is a fantastic channel for more of that passion to infect a greater segment of the population.     \\"Crush It\\" doesn't hold your hand through the gamete of online branding, but empowers you to learn it and embrace it and do it right. For the experienced Internet Marketer, this is a nice review iced with passion. For the tech clueless and for anyone who is worried that they may be using Facebook incorrectly, this is a must read!    The number one thing everyone needs to understand is the Internet has changed what it means to be private. There is NO privacy on the internet! (In fact, even this review can come up when someone \\"Googles\\" me). Gary shows you how to brand yourself effectively and safely online - and MAKE money doing it....
0061914177|5.0|Recently, I bought a handful of social media books via Amazon.  Since I have been doing some consulting and teaching on the side, I thought this would be a worthy investment.  The first book I decided to tackle was \\"Crush It!\\" by Gary Vaynerchuk.  If you're not familiar with Gary, he started WineLibrary.tv, which is his video blog wherein he gives his (very) honest opinion about various wines.  This may sound boring to you, but I would urge you to check it out.  You can feel Gary's enthusiasm coming off of the screen.    Using this tool, Gary took his family-owned liquor store from $4 million to over $60 million per year in sales.  Yes, you read that last sentence correctly.  He is @garyvee on Twitter, where he has amassed a simply huge entourage, with over 850,000 followers as of this writing.    Why?  Well, there are a number of reasons:        * Frankly, people want to know how to make a lot of money like he did      * He has an engaging personality      * He actually makes an attempt to respond to others on Twitter, unlike most social media \\"celebrities\\"    His passion for wine has taken him to a number of appearances on national television, including one very notable segment with Conan O'Brien where he managed to get Conan to eat a cigar and dirt while explaining wine flavors.    When I received \\"Crush It!\\" via UPS on my front porch, I was a little dismayed that it wasn't thicker (i.e. more pages).  My concern was soon allayed as I waded in and started reading.    Much like watching Gary speak, this book has an energetic tone that you don't find in most business-related books.  In fact, I'm not sure if I would categorize this strictly as business.  It's a morale builder.    In essence, the thesis of Gary's book is this: It takes a LOT of hard work to make a LOT of money.  With that in mind, why not work doing something you really are passionate about?    Gary also emphasizes the importance of loving your family above the work, which I certainly appreciate as afather of four and husband of nearly 17 years.     Upon finishing, I was happy to conclude/realize that in many ways I have already been on the right track with my social media efforts over the past couple of years, although reading this book and a few others has led me to start working on a couple of outside projects/sites, too.  My guess is that this book will have a tremendous impact on people who are languishing in jobs they hate.    The book is a relatively quick read, and you will find the story to be a compelling one.  Raised in New York in a Russian immigrant family, Gary's tale is a modern, web-based version of the American Dream.    Thanks for channeling your passion into this book, Gary.  I hope to crush it myself starting....now.
B0012GMV76|5.0|This is probably Jim Hall's most famous recording. One reviewer dismissed it as vile fluff. No accounting for taste. Depends on what your preferences are. One of my friends turned me on to this recording and she vastly prefers this to Miles Davis account of Rodrigo's concerto for guitar which I love but gosh I really like this too. One might call this WHITE Jazz. The piano solo ROCKS with deep beauty. There is a very good reason why super models should be walking down a runway to this kind of music. It is the embodiment and personification and epitome of it's time and place. A special moment in musical history of the 20th Century and Gone with the Wind. No one is doing it now.

0440243688|2.0|Jack Reacher used to be a strong silent type who knew how to get out of any trap. I really miss that guy. He existed in plots that moved quickly and did not strain credibility in the context of his genre.  Now he tells you how tall he is about every 20 pages and how much he weighs about as often and he always lets you know going into a fight that he is going to beat the **** out of his multiple opponents. His sex life continues to be perfunctory, but now the characters of the women are barely delineated or very very tired cliches.    I really loved this series and accepted that quality would vary, but this is the the third dud in a row. I miss the good old days and am hoping Mr Child takes a year or so off and comes back with a fresh perspective, a better plot, less filler, and a less arrogant Jack.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I've been a Slash fan since...well, forever. And I was a diehard GNR fan, and really like Velvet Revolver.  I still listen to Slash's Snakepit's \\"Ain't Life Grand Album\\" regularly. I've pretty much devoured anything he's ever done, because he does it the way no one else does.  He has written some of the most well known licks ever heard in music, and seems to do it effortlessly.  Needless to say, I was holding my breath waiting for this album.<br /><br />And it does not disappoint!  It's EXACTLY how I pictured a Slash solo album would be - rocking, diverse, and filled with amazing guitar solos! I literally love every single song on here except one (more on that later). To have an album filled with such diverse singers and still make it rock is something very few people can do. I never, EVER thought I would like a song that Fergie sings, and yet \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" is one of the highlights of the album!<br /><br />Most tracks are straight rock, with maybe two of them having a slower tempo.  I LOVE the track with Rocco DeLuca \\"Saint is a Sinner Too\\" - slow, great acoustic guitar, and catchy like no other! I love how diverse Slash's playing is, and he never feels the need to chicken pick (aka play at lightning speed) every solo just to show off his talent. His mastery of the blues/minor scales are amazing.  I really do think of this as the newest GNR album, just without Axl's massive ego and now completely shot vocals.<br /><br />The only song I really don't like is \\"We're All Gonna Die\\" with Iggy Pop.  I like Iggy, and the music is pretty rockin. But the lyrics - WOW are they bad!  Here's an excerpt from the chorus:<br /><br />\\"We're all gonna die, so let's get high...Pee on the ground, and jump around\\". And it gets even worse than that.<br /><br />Other than that skidmark, the rest of the album is incredible. I can't stop listening to it, and every listen makes me like a new song even more. If you like rock, you owe it to yourself to check this album out! Slash - keep doing what you're doing!
6301966740|5.0|Excellent quality tape. Restored, full-length,non-color-botched Turner version. Tour-de-force for both Ingrid Bergman and Humphry Bogart. One of Peter Lorre's best charactor parts, while Sidney Greenstreet plays Sidney Greenstreet once again. Dooley Wilson sings a number of great songs as \\"Sam\\". The movie is full of charactor actors who in reality had escaped from Hilter's/Musselini's Europe with their lives. Unfortunatly, the three alternate endings are not inculded, but you see the film as released in theater. One of my 20 all-time favorite films.

B00000JFC4|5.0|It's the good-guys against the bad-guys and all odds once again, with a little fun poked at it's self. This movie deserved a sequel, but didn't get it. I wouldn't think of John Cleese(Monty Python) as a sheriff, but he did more than a good job of acting. Also, Kevin Kline is outstanding as \\"Paden\\". A very young Kevin Costner shows his talent too. Grab the bowl of pop-corn, a big soda, some candy and relax and be entertained, as entertainment is what this movie is about. There's enough to the charactors that they aren't cardboard cut-outs, but it's not a deep \\"why do they do what they do?\\" film either. Plenty of action, but some side-ways comedy thrown in.
0143036424|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a literate friend, and there are accolades from other authors on the cover. Its gimmick, like Gorky Park, Bangcok 8, Tony Hillerman, is to put the reader in a novel setting with unfamiliar characters.     Unfortunately, unlike the works listed above, this book is a nonstop display of clumsy, ham-fisted writing.     You can see the author laboring to be funny, quirky, educated, eclectic, etc. The book is filled with irrelevencia aimed at such effects: allusions to the classics, dialogue loaded with irrelevant and labored humor, a parade of predictably quirky minor characters, clumsy attempts to define personality through dialogue using verbal characteristics completely at odds with their natures, the repetitive use of hackneyed beats to tempo dialogue (\\"I reached out for the phone.\\" \\"He looked up.\\" \\"I took a breath.\\" \\"She looked up\\" -- everyone's either looking up or using some respiratory function to create pauses in the pace of converstaion). Rather than using precise and skillful dialogue to reveal the tone of the speech, there is the crutch of \\"he said xxxx-ly\\" (angry-, smiling-, grumpy-, etc.)  In sum, if you know anything about writing, you will find this book to be a clunky, awkward, beginner's attempt at narrative, dialogue, characterization, plotting, etc. It was as painful as watching an unskilled juggler's fumbling tricks.
0800132343|5.0|This edition is even LONGER than the original un-cut theatrical version! At the end, the director says \\"We wanted to make the ultimate U-boat movie.\\" He did. Now it's set in Autumn of 1941, and the \\"header\\" says the tide was turning against the U-Boats, which isn't true at all. In fact, the U-boat crews referred to this as \\"the happy time\\" because they were sinking so many ships bound for England. The scean where the U-96 finishes off the tanker with a torpedo is of-course, all wrong, as they would have used the deck gun instead of their precious limited number of \\"fish\\", but that would have been even gorier to the left-behind tanker crew. We all know depth charges didn't go off 20 yards from a U-boat and it survive. 2000 yards could be fatal! The part where they lose depth control and run into the bottom at nearly 900 feet would be pure fiction, except that is almost word for word from Otto Krechtmer's U-99 log(but they were captured when they surficed). BMW built amazingly great boats, but the hulls could withstand more depth-charges than the crew's nerves could. All-in-all, it's a fairly accurate account of a cruise on a U-boat. Far better than any other sub movie ever made. This isn't a \\"fun\\" movie, but it's good. I prefer the sub-titled version to the English dubbed version as the dialog is more accurate, and the Director's Cut is \\"harder\\" than the theatrical version.
0385504225|3.0|Contrary to some of the other reviews, I don't NOT like this book because of the writing style. Anyone's who has read Brown's work before this (which I have) should know how he writes. A lot of people also give Brown the benefit of the doubt because they say he couldn't have followed a book like The Da Vinci Code, which is true, but I don't think that's why this book fails. This book fails because it suffers from a really weak plot. With an even weaker villain. Many of the chapters felt more like padding to make the book thicker than what it really needed to be. It starts off strong with a lot of intrigue and mystery, but the mystery wears thin after a while and the big secret reveal at the end after being built up throughout the entire book really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I really thought Noetic Science was going to play a larger role in this, but Brown simply mentions it and never touches it again. Which brings me to my next problem...what's with the \\"wink and nod\\" plot devices that are left open-ended with no resolution? Noetic Science. Mentioning signs that show our Founding Fathers were much more \\"spiritual\\" than we've been led to believe.     For instance, the mentioning of George Washington's painting. Brown should know by now that his fans WANT him to delve into things like Masonic lore and myth. Creating a weave of conspiracy and mystery. That's what many people thought they were getting from this book and why so many are disappointed with how \\"watered-down\\" or sanitized it seems to be. I'm not anti-Mason, but Brown is waaay too obvious in the apologetic role he takes of the organization in this book.    I also agree with reviewers who say Brown is already thinking ahead to the movie. Maybe that impacted what he wrote and how he wrote it. Dan Brown missed a golden opportunity with The Lost Symbol and could have taken us all over the original 13 American colonies if he wanted to (well not all of them lol) because there's definitely tons of history,both accepted and alternative, that he could have worked with to make a stronger book. Instead he stays in Washington DC and WORSE, ONE BUILDING in Washington DC for most of the book! Overall, a page-turner yes...but the book has some agitating qualities and redundancies mixed with a weak plot and weak characters that makes for a book that never had a chance in hell of living up to its own hype.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Of all the zombie movies that have ever come out, this is probably the first that actually focused on developing multiple characters, and made the movie about the characters, and not about how much gore and blood can be shown.  And it was funny.  Starring two famous actors, Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray, and 3 small-name stars, this fairly short movie (1.5 hours) takes place in an America that has been overrun by man-eating zombies.  The movie's narrator is also of the main characters, a nerdy, shy dork who has managed to survive this world by following a set of hard rules, which he keeps written down in a notepad.  The movie is about his travel across America, and his meeting up with 3 other human survivors of the zombie plague.  Periodically, the movie features a scene that highlights one of his rules in action; always in a comedic setting.  The finale is an action sequence played out in a California amusement park, which is probably the only finale I've seen in an amusement park.  All told, a great movie; though full of gore.
0307266303|3.0|I found this book pretty interesting, but McDougall makes a lot of sweeping statements about a wide variety of subjects. Much of it seems legit, but I honestly wouldn't know if it weren't, since it is mostly outside my experience. However, I know something about horses, and I would like to point out that they DO cool themselves primarily by sweating, and even have a protein called latherin in their sweat that acts as a surfactant to disperse the sweat down their hairs and across the surface of the body--that's why they look foamy sometimes when sweating heavily. This counters what McDougall says (paraphrasing Dr. Bramble of Harvard, I think) on page 223: that humans are the only mammals that cool off by sweating instead of breathing.     Additionally, in Chapter 27, McDougall mentions some research from Harvard about equine speed versus human speed, citing research that calculates top horse gallop speed at 7.7 meters/second and human marathoner jog speed at 6 meters/second. Well, 7.7 meters/second is only about 17 mph, and Thoroughbred and Quarter horse racehorses run at 30-40 mph: more like 15-18 meters/second, and they can sustain that for 500-3500 meters (1/2 to 2 1/2 miles), or up to three or four minutes. Maybe Harvard wasn't looking at racehorses for their research.     I don't blame McDougall for these mistakes, if they are in fact mistakes, because he was just reporting what trusted researchers told him. Nor do I refute the point of all those figures as they relate to human endurance, which is that a group of humans could successfully hunt speedy flight animals by means of their human stamina, ingenuity, and determination. After all, the first humans to catch or hunt horses had to do so on foot.

0385732554|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is a very interesting book and I enjoyed it very much. It depicted a utopian community. The main character is named Jonas, a young male, who is picked to be the new receiver of memories. Each person in the community was assigned a role in the community when they were an eleven, such as a laborer, director of recreation, caretaker of the old, nurturer etc.. They train to be that role until they are finished and take up that job. The receiver of memories is a special job, because there is only one and they are the only person who knows about the real world. When someone is the receiver of memories he or she receives memories of the world before this utopia where there was color and love and fear and war and music. Jonas realizes that the community that he lives in is not the world he wants to be in, so he runs away and saves a baby who was going to be released (killed ), doing so releasing the memories of the real world. This book is very disturbing at parts. I recommend that children under the age of eight probably should not read it, but for preteens to adults this is a great book. Over all I think Lois Lowry did a terrific job on this book and I would recommend  \\" The Giver\\"  highly.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|...that's not always a good thing. ***SPOILERS ABOUND*** When I watched this with my wife, I told her the movie felt like some episode of the Twilight Zone extended into a 2-hour film. When I was talking about how bad this movie was with a work buddy of mine, I told him that it was like Donnie Darko (an excellent film) with a lot of crazy stuff happening. Little did I know until I researched further, it was based on a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone (which was based on ahort story by Richard Matheson), and the director of this atrocity was also the director of Donnie Darko. However, a story like this works best as a short skit for shows like \\"The Outer Limits\\" and \\"The Twilight Zone\\" but not so much as a movie unless you really go to lengths to change it up and make it coherent. And unlike Donnie Darko, this made absolutely no sense and had an ending that left me feeling the film was unresolved. The problem with the movie are the questions left behind. Sure, some movies require the audience to think and come up with their own interpretations, but this is not one of them. Let me say that the movie is not at all boring, it kept me and my wife on the edge of our seats trying to figure this out, but the ending just left most of everything unresolved. Here is a breakdown of all that is confusing:    1) If you push the button somebody will die. Early on, the audience believes that this means somebody will be killed, which coincidentially happens. But it does not. Because the couple are given an option to either live with the money and their \\"now deformed\\" son or the husband shoots the wife and the son gets restored. Yes, you can argue that by living with the money, their son won't be the same, so it can be like death, and I'm not going to contest it. 2) All the ones to die appear to be women shot by husbands. Is this because women are theo only ones to push the button? Or is there something binding between mother and child, that only a woman can be killed in orderto restore the child? 3) The woman cannot sacrifice herself by killing herself to restore their child. They must be murdered by their husband. What?? So this \\"being\\", whatever he is, acts self-righteous about the plight of mankind, yet he condones murder and domestic violence? 4) This \\"being\\", as I refer to him as, seems to be able to control the minds of his \\"employees\\". Who are these employees? Were they previous people who had pushed the button? What is their role? 5) The library scene of choosing between damnation and salavation, he chose salvation and still was tormented by the events that unfolded, so what was the point? 6) The dead wife's husband, who had the box previously, shows up about 3/4 into the film and spews off nonsense about the CIA, and government operatives, and what not, but it doesn't go anywhere. Nor do we ever get to really know what is truly going on.    Now all of this I can generally ignore and move on except for the ending. I've looked everywhere and nobody can explain it. The husband is arrested by the police and then unexpectedly the handcuffs are removed and he is placed into what looks like a government car with similar NASA plates as the one the Mr. Stewart is driving. Somebody looks at him and says we are going to take care of you. And then it ends. Does this mean that he won't be arrested but have to serve as one of Mr. Stewart's employees? And if so, how will this benefit him? Will this redeem him for pushing the button? I'm confused.
0805091742|4.0|\\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" is a simple read that communicates an effective approach to managing complex and challenging processes and scenarios. Before going on, I must add that I am a checklist user because of their simplicity and the results I derive from using them. Atul Gawande uses present and historical examples to present the power of a checklist, however, I did find that he might have provided too much detail in profiling the scenarios. Don't get me wrong, the examples fit but I wanted him to stay focused to how the use of checklists were being applied. Finally, I appreciated his honesty in presenting his views. I felt like he was conversing with his audience. I liked this style. I do recommend this book.

The description of the different living creatures and plants were written for amateurs, and didnt contain too much difficult scientific terms. The small thumbs with size of object related to human size is a smart thing. It is also great for looking in together with kids, as the images are very describing.  Higly recommended, and a very good price! Will look for more books in this series.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|The following review was published on Rancho Santa Fe Review, Carmel Valley News, We Chinese in America, and (...). I also reviewed it on Fox 5 San Diego, wsRadio \\"Perry Previews the Movies.\\"  --------------------    What if the girl that the Frog Prince kissed in the fairytale was not a princess, would the magic still work?  You will find the answer in the magical new Disney animated musical, \\"The Princess and the Frog,\\" directed by the same directors who brought us Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.     The story is about Tiana, an African American little girl who wished upon an evening star in hope to get a restaurant of her own called \\"Tiana's Place.\\"  She suddenly saw a frog staring at her!  She screamed and ran away.  When she grew up, she had finally saved enough money to buy a place for a restaurant.  It was a rather disheveled and shabby looking house.  Tiana's loving, nurturing mother Eudora helped her tidy things up.  Tiana had vivid plans for the future, but they were erased by another man who offered a much higher price.  The land owners reneged on their promise.    Tiana then again wished upon the evening star.  She was shocked to see the frog again, sitting on the balcony!  \\"Ha ha, very funny,\\" she said, \\"I suppose you want a kiss?\\"  \\"That would be nice!\\" said the frog.  And that is where she flipped out.    It turned out that the visiting prince of Meladonia was stuck in a frog form after the evil Dr. Facilier transformed him by voodoo magic.  The frog prince promised to make Tiana's wish come true with just one kiss from her.  Tiana unwillingly kissed the frog, but something queer happened to HER!  When she looked in the mirror, she screamed in horror and jumped very high.  She saw her hand turn into a green web foot and she was secreting mucus all over her body!  She became a frog too!  Tiana and Naveen must now use their wit to navigate through the dangerous bayou in search for a cure to their spell.    One of the amazing achievements of this movie is in the large number of superb supporting characters, each with a rich and unique personality, including:  Ray, a lovesick Cajun firefly who is in love with Evangeline, the evening star; Louis, a jazz-crazed alligator who wants to play with \\"the big boys;\\" Dr. Facilier, a charismatic evil voodoo fortune teller with friends from the other side; Mama Odie, a buoyant, playful, 200-year-old seer who lives in the bayou on a boat stuck in a tree; James, Tiana's inspirational loving father who believed that wishing upon a star can only do half of the job, the rest has to come from hard work.     My favorite character is Tiana.  She not only has big dreams, but also works hard to achieve them.  She is very attractive and a great cook since she was a little girl.  I loved how Tiana made a delicious, tantalizing swamp gumbo and taught the carefree, fun-loving Naveen how to mince mushrooms.    I think Naveen looked better than Tiana when they were frogs.  He had expressive eyebrows and gleaming white teeth.  He is livelier as a frog too.  I liked how he made musical instrument out of a tree branch and spider web.    I love the storyline because it is fascinating and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.    I have many favorite scenes, one of them is when Ray the firefly died, he became a star, right next to Evangeline, the evening star!  This is the first Disney movie that I know to have a character who is not a villain who died.  The funniest scene was when Tiana said, \\"Just one kiss,\\" then Naveen the frog prince said, \\"Unless you beg for more!\\"  I thought these two scenes are genius touches.    The visual style is stunning. I especially love the multi-colored bottles in Mama Odie's place.  In the end, I liked when the golden light and the water surrounded Tiana and Naveen.    When I was very little, there were many frogs in our backyard that I often caught after it rained.  I named one of them, a tiny green tree frog \\"Chile,\\" who is my favorite, and wrote storiesabout him.  I never kissed any frog myself because I wouldn't want to turn into one!    I watched the first 30 minute preview of this amazing film at the Disney D23 Fan Expo in Anaheim in September 2009 as the youngest credentialed media representative.  I had a prediction that this could be a five starfish film if the rest is as good as the preview.  I was right!  I was thrilled to meet and interview directors John Musker and Ron Clements immediately following their panel discussion at D23.  Both enjoyed my drawings of frogs and dragon, and autographed for me.  I asked why they chose an African American girl as their heroine for this movie.  John Musker said, \\"It has not been done before.  We thought this would be something new.  The story is set in New Orleans where there is a large African American community.  We thought it would be fun to have a heroine that is different from the other ones.\\"    What a difference indeed!  When I compared Tiana and many other Disney princesses from older movies, I noticed an immediate difference:  The other princesses were mostly wishful and lazy, waiting for some prince to deliver them to salvation.  Tiana, however, is self-reliant, who also reforms a lazy prince and teaches him why work is important.  Why would a prince from other Disney movies want to marry a princess whom he doesn't really know, and who doesn't know how to do anything useful except flirting around and looking pretty?     The Princess and the Frog is about love, sacrifice, dreams, and how to make your dreams come true.    When you know what your dreams are, you must pursue them with hard work.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|I don't think I can articulate my thoughts on this movie any better than Bret Fetzer did in his editorial review for Amazon.com  (you can read it on the product description page).  Fetzer nailed it.<br /><br />I've always liked Peter Sarsgaard.  If you haven't seen him in \\"Shattered Glass\\", beat a path to the video store to get it.  But I certainly wasn't prepared for Carey Mulligan.  Holy crikey!  The only thing I'd seen her in before was a blink-and-you'll-miss it appearance in 2009's \\"Brothers\\".  With \\"An Education\\", Mulligan proves beyond any doubt (and was there really any?) that she can act beautifully AND carry an entire movie.  Fetzer described her correctly  -- she is indeed luminous.<br /><br />This DVD is going into my personal library.  No doubt about it.  This is one of those \\"performance\\" movies that you can't help but be in awe of.<br /><br />Heck, I'm not going to say anymore about it. Scroll back up and read Fetzer's editorial review.

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|The following review was published on La Jolla Light, Del Mar Times, Rancho Santa Fe Record, Carmel Valley Leader, Solana Beach Sun, and We Chinese in America newspapers, and my website [...]  ---------------    Have you ever wondered how many balloons it takes to lift a real house?  Over 20 million!  Carl Fredrickson, a widowed 78-year-old curmudgeon and main hero in the uplifting Pixar 3-D movie \\"Up\\", has the curiosity and courage to try it!      While heading toward his dream home in his floating house to the remote \\"Paradise Falls\\", the lost world in South America that he and his deceased wife Ellie always wanted to go, Carl finds an unwitting stowaway on his front porch: a chubby 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell.      Together, Carl and Russell explored the forest with their newly-discovered exotic friend that Russell named \\"Kevin.\\"  Soon, they discovered that the faded hero and nature explorer Charles Muntz has been chasing Kevin for over 50 years at Paradise Falls.  To save Kevin, Carl and Russell must go through an unimaginable adventure that changes their lives forever.    When I asked Pete Docter, the tall and \\"animated\\" director, why he chose balloons to float the house instead of seagulls (or other flying devices), he responded, \\"There is something very magical and poetic about the balloon for me as a child.  When I let go of it, I'm not getting it back.  It is a bit like Carl's relationship with his wife Ellie.\\" Jonas Rivera, \\"Up\\" producer added, \\"And balloons are much more colorful than seagulls too!\\"     My favorite character is Russell because I always want to be an explorer myself.  I love exploring the Torrey Pines State Reserve and Carmel Creek which inspire me to write poems.      I love the dazzling actions, amazing visual effects, and the beautiful music.  \\"Up\\" is about escape, friendship, and connections.  My favorite scene is the last scene.  After their long and arduous quest to explore nature's wonders, Carl and Russell each found someone to love.    [[ASIN:B002LK3DUQ UP (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition + Digital Copy)]]
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|There are plenty of detailed reviews waxing about what makes this album so good, I won't waste your time with another one but I will say that Graceland is the single best album I have encountered. The lyrics, the music, the arrangement, everything. It borders on perfection. The sound is extremely unique, the poetry is beautiful, the lyrics are clever, fun, sad and ironic at the same time, and it is one of those very rare albums that gets better each time you listen to it. However, I think the thing that really makes Graceland stand apart from every other cd I have heard is the storytelling. I have listened to this album all the way through many times, it never gets boring and every time I discover something new and wonderful. The first couple of times I listened to this cd I liked, but did not love it; after familiarizing myself a bit I came to appreciate how wonderful it is. I really can't recommend this strongly enough.

Mr. Fox, who looks like a businessman in a smartly tailored suit, is the leader of the animal team in the 2-D stop-motion animated feature \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox.\\"  A few years ago, he had promised his short-tempered wife, Mrs. Fox who was pregnant at the time, to never steal a chicken or livestock ever again after they were trapped in a cage while attempting to steal a chicken.  Mr. Fox then became a columnist for the animal newspaper, but with paltry readership.  His wild animal instinct yearned to be in the action and dodge danger.    Mr. Fox sneakily stole food and chickens from the meanest farmers in the neighborhood, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.  Boggis, owner of a chicken farm, is very large and eats three chickens each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, that is 12 chickens a day!    Bunce is the size of a dwarf.  His head would be submerged in the shallow end of a swimming pool.  He eats doughnuts with goose liver injected into them.  That may sound disgusting, but goose liver is a great delicacy, and Bunce doesn't seem to know that.    Bean is as skinny as a pencil and the meanest of the three.  He makes distilled hard cider with his genetically engineered apples.  He drinks only cider, and leads the human army in the man vs. animal war.    Mrs. Fox finally found out about Mr. Fox's hidden activities, but worse yet, the farmers plotted an epic revenge.  Mr. Fox must assemble an army of animals and use his wit, strategic thinking, and wild animal spirit to win the battle.    In the fox family, there is also a \\"small one,\\" Ash.  He is the only son, I mean cub.  He is a problem child, because he is not confident and always wears a strange outfit - a cape.  Ash is distant from everyone because he feels deprived of love and attention from his scheming dad.    When Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the Fox family, Ash is jealous of Kristofferson's many talents: yoga, graceful diving, and excellent sportsmanship in the complicated game of whackbat.  Intense \\"cousin rivalry\\" ensued.    I noticed that while the mammals such as Mr. Fox talked in the movie, the chickens did not.  I thought maybe if the chickens did talk, Mr. Fox would feel sympathy and not eat them.  But Mr. Fox spoke English just like the farmers, and the farmers still wanted to kill him.  Also, the rat who guarded Bean's cider cellar told Mr. Fox that his dying wish was to taste Bean's cider, but I saw the rat sipping the very cider contentedly with a long straw earlier in the film!      My mom once saw a fox pulling a dead fox off of a road so that cars would not drive through the dead fox.  They were like Mr. Fox in looks, but were not clothed and could not talk or walk on two legs.  They were not afraid of humans.  My mom was impressed by their caring for each other.    I give this movie four starfish.  It is about friendship, wit, trickery, and strategy.  I like the visual style of the film.  The fur looks so real, it moves when the animals talk or have facial expressions.      After watching the film, I read the book from which this movie is based, that was originally published in 1970, a children's book classic.  The author Roald Nahl has good drawings though his sketch is somewhat blurry.  I like the movie better because the characters are richer.  There are new characters like Ash and Kristofferson in the movie that made the family dynamics more interesting.  The visuals are more vivid and the story is funnier in the movie.    My favorite character is Mr. Fox.  He is witty, smart, and charming.  He is a messy eater who wolfs down his food.  Mr. Fox is not careful and his strategies often backfire, because he thinks only of the thrill and reward, not of the risk and consequences of his actions.  One of the early scenes showed Mr. Fox using blueberries with crude anesthesia to drug the beagles guarding Boggis's chicken house.  When Mr. Fox and his helper the opossum stole a chicken, sirens flashed and gave away their identity, they scrambled over the electric fence, being shocked all the way!    My favorite scene is when Mr. Fox raised his paw and the silhouetted wolf raised his too, in recognition of brotherhood and wild animal spirit.  This is also the funniest scene.    Before taking risks, think about not only the rewards, but also the consequences.    [[ASIN:B0035G5IOE Fantastic Mr. Fox (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]

B001HN694K|4.0|The following review was published on La Jolla Light, Del Mar Times, We Chinese in America newspaper and    Perry's Previews:  [...]    ------------    What would the young Alice from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" be like... 13 years later?  Faced with the challenges and issues of adult life, will she have time to retreat into the fantasy world of Wonderland?     Tim Burton's new film adds a unique twist to the classic story.  It is about love, courage, sacrifice, dreams, and reality.     When 19-year-old Alice Kingsley is invited to a surprise party hosted for her own engagement, she sees a peculiar sight: a rabbit in formal clothing pointing to his watch and beckons her to join him.  She follows him down a large hole, and through many twists and turns, ends up in the land where all of her childhood dreams took place.  She finds out that the Red Queen had governed poorly and cruelly, giving death to all the people who did not follow her rules.     Alice must bring order to the land and make the Red Queen pay for her wrong doings.  In Wonderland, which is called \\"Underland\\" in the new film, Alice meets many strange creatures, such as the fat, argumentative twins Tweedledum and Tweedeldee, grotesque beasts such as Jabberwocky, a clown-like Mad Hatter with a crazy smile and red hair, a mysterious blue-striped cat who can disappear instantly, a wise Caterpillar who smokes, and two sibling rulers who are the exact opposite of each other.     A calendar scroll has not only what happened to the Underland, but foretells what will happen in the future, including an epic battle which makes Alice realize who she really is.     I can relate to Alice because I have a wild imagination too.  I made up many stories to share with my mom when I was in pre-school, including one with me being a spirit in the sky and breaking a magic teapot in order to come to the ground and finding my mom by recognizing her beautiful garden.  One of my favorite activities these days is still making and sharing stories with mom.     My two favorite characters are Alice and the Mad Hatter.  Alice has great imagination, just like her beloved diseased father \\"who could imagine six impossible things before breakfast.\\"  Alice said \\"Why don't you just paint the white roses red\\" when her potential future mother-in-law wished she had red roses instead.  I like the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) because he is charming, loyal, and risked his life for Alice many times.     One of my favorite scenes is when the Bandersnatch, a giant, savage, muscular, snow leopard-like creative with claws as long as your hand licks Alice's wounds that he made in an earlier fight.  I also like the scene that followed when Alice rides the Bandersnatch after taming him in an impossible gesture of forgiveness.      I give the film 4.5 out of 5 starfish.  I enjoyed the many unexpected yet believable scenes related to the character development.  I loved the stunning visuals and 3D effects that made the characters jump out of the screen in a riot of colors!  Meeting Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at the Disney D23 Fan Expo last September was a real treat.  The film has a powerful moral:     Imagination makes you discover who you truly are.
0441013597|4.0|Frank Herbert has crafted a vast universe in his Dune chronicles, with well-established politics, religion, an established economy and family dynasties. At the forefront of his immense worldbuilding is our hero, Paul Atreides, who at the beginning of the novel is a mere fifteen years old. He is the son of a duke and has been trained since childhood to later become a duke himself. His mother is a Bene Gesserit, a school that teaches what most would consider a type of witchcraft.    The novel takes place 8000 years in the future; however, it takes place in a time when computers have become prohibited. It centers around the planet Arrakis, which is the sole source of the valuable spice melange. The planet is so dry that its inhabitants wear stillsuits to maintain moisture. In fact, to shed a tear or to spit is a sign of honor, as each drop of water is so precious.     Paul's father, Duke Leto has been named governor of this very important planet but is soon betrayed by a rival family. Paul Atreides escapes and is forced to brave the hostile environment and people on Arrakis to help restore justice to his family.     The appeal of _Dune_ is well understood. While our hero is an aristocrat, we see his character develop over the course of the novel from a teenager in training with a great love for people into a messianic leader who saves the Fremen of Arrakis from the Harkonen family. To build a universe such as Herbert did in _Dune_ is monumental.    Furthermore, like many of the greats of science fiction, Frank Herbert was ahead of his time. A great part of the novel focuses on the ecology of Arrakis -- a topic that we now see as the focus in science and industry on Earth. He writes skillfully and is able to communicate his intricate universe in a story that is approachable.    My criticism of the novel first lies in the writing style. The narrative point of view is written in the third person, and the perspective shifts from person to person at a moment's notice. Perhaps a lot of the tension is removed with this style of writing, for the reader has complete knowledge of each character's motives in his or her actions. Unfortunately, I see this writing style has alienated some readers so much as to give this novel a 1-star rating, which is absolutely ludicrous. My only other frustrations with the novel are the excess detail often given about the Bene Gesserit and the quite abrupt ending to the novel.    Overall, this novel clearly stands as one of the hallmarks of speculative fiction and is required reading for any fan of the genre. I have not read any of the subsequent novels, but I appreciate the vast world Herbert has created.
B002N1RM5A|5.0|Die Schone Mullerin, one of the most popular song cycles of Schubert, sung and recorded by numerous artists in the past and present, from tenor to baritone (to even some sopranos).<br />Lieder singing is not limited to small voices, I believe. And Jonas Kaufmann just simply offered, with his partner Helmut Deutsche, a glaringly striking example of how lieder singing 'could' be apart from the traditional 'smallish-voiced' singing.<br />True that the opening pieces may offer the listener certain discomfort, especially if the listener has got 'used to' listening to threads of voices in these pieces. It takes around 4 to 5 numbers before unaccustomed listeners got attuned to Kaufmann's style.<br />Once got used to, wow, what a jaw-dropping interpretation! What glorious expressiveness! What depth of emotional outpouring!<br />I cannot find adequate words (given my limited vocabulary) to describe the absolutlely stunned feeling of listening to Kaufmann's Die Schone Mullerin. Let me admit - no one single lieder singer had managed to grip my attention to the extent as Mr. Kaufmann in this entire cycle, not even Fischer-Dieskau, let alone Wunderlich or Gerhaher.<br />Helmut Deutsche accounts for half of this live performance's success. Both he and Kaufmann presented the cycle as a compact and composite entirety, closely knit in emotion and musicality. Kaufmann's great vocal capacity blends in well with Deutsche's almost aggressively expressive 'accompaniment' - accompaniment may not be the right word, since it is not secondary to the vocal line but everywhere going parallel with it.  Without Kaufmann's large vocal expressive capacity, however, even Deutsche's 'accompaniment' would not have worked so effectively.<br />A marvellous pair in all respects.<br />If any one seeks to dismiss this wonderful recital as 'another' Die Schone Mullerin, he would be missing out a big deal!
B0000A5BSE|4.0|My only qualm is that this release is part of the Rudy Van Gelder Remaster Series, though that isn't mentioned anywhere in the label information or in the product description.  I bought it thinking it would be a European remastering.  Not that the quality is bad or anything, it's just that some people have very strong opinions about the RVG series, and this should be made clear in the description so as not to mislead anyone.
B00004XQJX|5.0|So this set of variations represent the most difficult of Beethoven's piano compositions.<br />If not briefed on this 'fact', one would in no way figure out how difficult the piece is under Pollini's hands: he was so fleet and fluent, so at ease and relaxed, so refined and expressive in this recording.<br />There are numerous other recordings of this set that leave the listeners strained and even bored upon listening. Surprisingly, while I approahced this with the same premonition, but happily got a totally different experience upon listening to the entire set - the variations are presented in so many different tone colours, so variant in mood and tempi, as if each individual short excerpt has its own tale to tell. Yet binding them 34 short excerpts together is the structured Beethoven style that runs through from the start right to the very end.<br />It was Beethoven speaking throughout; not Pollini. The way Pollini approached the excerpts - in a highly authentic and classic-romantic style that betrays no self-indulgence as in some other eminent interpretors (like Friedrich Gulda's 'jazzy' set), at the same time unconsciouly demonstrating a diabolical technique is some thing that represent nothing but the pinnacle of this performer's artistry.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This was my very first blu-ray purchase.  It looks spectacular and I recomend this buy even if you already own the dvd, it's worth the upgrade.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I saw the movie, Couldn't wait to get the DVD. Michael Moore is brutally honest in this movie. This will make you happy, It will make you cry, It will piss you off. Just buy it.
B002VECM72|5.0|If you have not yet seen THE BLIND SIDE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do.  THE BLIND SIDE is sweet, compelling, emotional, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It is the perfect movie for a warm, cozy evening at home.<br /><br />THE BLIND SIDE is the true story of a homeless teenager Michael Oher, and the family that unconditionally takes him in.  Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael walking the streets late one cold night, and invites him into her home.  Somehow they need each other, and Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family.  As Michael improves his grades and learns about football, they all learn about the meaning of love, life, family, and support.  THE BLIND SIDE will make you laugh, make you cry, and give you hope.  It truly is a feel good movie.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is excellent (and lovely) as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a strong, spunky woman with a huge heart, Tim McGraw as her amiable, likeable husband, and Quinton Aaron steals the show as the teenager who is so much more than he seems.  Kate Bates does a nice turn as Michael's tutor, encouraging him to do better, haranguing him when he doesn't try.  The chemistry of the entire cast is outstanding and quite believable.  The love of this family for each other radiates off the screen and makes you feel happy.  As an added bit of reality, a number of well-know NCAA college football coaches make cameo appearances as themselves.<br /><br />The script for THE BLIND SIDE is exceptional.  Even as life is getting better for Michael, you never forget where he came from and how hard he had to work.  You ache for this boy and horror of his childhood, and you cheer for this family and what they have done for each other.  The writers and the actors take you on a joyous emotional rollercoaster, from the tragic depths to the highest heights.  And the destination is most definitely worth the ride.<br /><br />So grab a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and a cuddly blanket.  Then pop in this movie and enjoy.  THE BLIND SIDE is a movie that you will be thinking about for days.  It is still making me smile.ys.  It is still making me smile.
B002QW7ALM|1.0|After reading all of the reviews, I honestly thought this would be a great Sci-Fi flick.  Not even close.  Now I know why the sellers gave me this film for $3.  Granted, it would have made a great 3-or-4-part sitcom, but not a full-length film.  The film was very dark...couldn't even see half of what was going on...and when the lighting was turned up, I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to see anyway!  LOL!  Maybe I've seen way too many Sci-Fi flicks, but there were better films (directing, script and acting) in the 50's and 60's.  If you're starved for a sci-fi (high budget) film, then watch this.  If you want quality, go back and re-watch \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", \\"Alien\\", or \\"The Blob\\".  What a waste of time this was.
0316154687|4.0|Hilarious.  Read it on a plane and embarrared myself laughing too much.<br /><br />Sedaris loses one star only because the flow of the book is completely interrupted at the end with a journal-entry style section about going to Japan.

0061914177|5.0|From the moment I read the first page of this book, I was hooked.    Gary Vee speaks to the people who are serious about getting it done.  If you are serious about being an entrepreneur, and using methods relevant to 2010, this is the book to read.  Time will tell if it is relevant in the future, but from today's perspective it works.  Not 2008, not 1998, 2010.    The guy gives valuable content, tells a good story, and takes no prisoners.    If you capture 1/10th of Gary Vee's passion, you will find yourself improving your business from the get-go.    Don't read this book if you are looking for a lottery ticket road to riches.  Gary Vee is real, authentic and speaking from his success, can tell you what it takes to make it doing business online in this decade.  He's got the following/tribe to prove it, as well as a successful online business and brand.    He's gonna own the Jets one day too.  You should be happy he already wrote a book about it.    Thanks, Gary Vee, for getting it done, and writing this.  I've probably influenced no less than 10 people to buy it.  Just ask all my friends.    Cheers, and you will not regret owning this book.
0061914177|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Gary Vaynerchuk and his realistic views on being able to make a living doing what you LOVE, but without the \\"get rich quick\\" lure. In person and in this book, Gary pushes authenticity, passion, genuine care, and eyes-bleeding HARD WORK to be able to live your dream. There is no cookie cutter roadmap, but just some tips and inspiration (and a little kick in the butt for those that go to work hating their job every day) in a quick and simple book called \\"Crush It\\". It's like Gary talking to you while you're in bed...how nice =)
B000000W6F|4.0|Until recently, I've had a fair amount of trouble listening all the way through \\"Gish\\". Now I've come to embrace it as a great straightforward psychedelic rock album.    I suspect that the initial problem I had with \\"Gish\\" was my expectations of it. I had come to love Smashing Pumpkins as a psycholgically dramatic band that specialized in angst. In my mind, they were an excellent band for highly emotional and sometimes melancholic people like myself. My first encounter with them, after all, was \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\". So when I first listened to \\"Gish\\", I was quite confused. What is this? Hippie music from Smashing Pumpkins? I knew I was missing some kind of point.     Today I know what that point is. \\"Gish\\" bares very little resemblance to the alternative rock that defined the 90s. Instead it sounds more like Led Zeppelin or perhaps Cream with more nasally vocals. That goes for the quieter songs as well as the drum-heavy rockers.     \\"Gish\\" is not music for sitting on the edge of your bed, swinging your head around wildly and thinking about all the things that piss you off or make you depressed. Instead, when you listen to it, try to enjoy the moment, relax, and feel those good loving vibrations like it's 1968.
B000F48D3C|5.0|I once had an SFC who used to ask the question \\"Yeah, soldier but what if ...?\\"  This film is the ultimate answer to what can happen if nobody in the Army demands answers to questions like \\"What if...?\\"  What if they know we're coming?  What if the enemy blockades the streets and trap us inside?  What if they shoot down two of our helicopters and we can't get to crash sites when we need to?  What if we're out numbered?  What if other U. S. Army units don't even know that we're going in for big military operation today?  What if our intel people have grossly under-estimated the Somali militia's ability to fight back?  What if we need more decisive military force than we originally planned for?  What if on our worse day and their best day we get our butts kicked?  What if there are casualties?  What if this mission actually takes more than 45 minutes?  What if we bit off more than we could chew?
0393075966|1.0|This book is terrible!      The author claims we are devestated by global warming. Then, he wants carbon taxes.    Here are his words; \\"Even without the crisis, the prices of all goods are distorted because we have trusted out atmosphere (and, too often, clean water) as if it were free, when in fact it is scarce. The extent of price distortion for any particular good depends on the amount of \\"carbon\\" that is contained in its production...\\"     Finally, he makes a push for Obama's universal health care: \\"GDP per capita measures what we spend on health care, not the output.  ... America's GDP per capita appears higher than that of France and the United Kingdom partly because our our health care system is less efficient.\\"     There is not a single chart, graph or table in the book- probably to prevent facts from getting in the way of the author's opinions. So, only read this if you want to waste your time on biased political opinions without any facts.
B00007K02F|3.0|I watched this movie a couple times and tried to like it, but it was hard because I've seen other versions, and thought that in some of them main characters were better portrayed than here. In this adaptation, it seemed that William Hurt was bored or didn't care, I thought that his acting was very flat. I could understand Charlotte Gainsbourg's cold and flat portrayal of Jane Eyre because Jane was supposed to be reserved (at least in the begining of her relationship with Mr. Rochester) coming from Lowood school. Also, I didn't like that part with Mr.Rivers was changed, but I guess the filmmakers had to shorten and change the story somewhere to fit into 2 hrs. I gave 3 stars for beautiful music score and scenery. I like to watch different Jane Eyre versions because it's one of my favorite stories, but I don't think I'll fall in love with this one.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|Visually and acoustically well done. Good acting, good editing, etc.        Great as that all was, the story was just ok. The idea was pretty cool, but it just wasn't enthralling, and I felt the move was well over hyped.     Worth renting and watching once or twice.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Where has this film been all my life?!?!  I have not yet read the book from which it is based; however, it is a new favorite for the literature lovers in our family.  The characters' \\"dialogue\\" (more like alternating monologues)kept our teenage daughter laughing in delight.  The main characters, Helene Hanff and Frank Doel, speak their long-distance correspondence for our benefit.  A truly refreshing aspect of their budding friendship is that it is considerate of the different cultures in which they live, and it is CHASTE.  Wow!  We get rich insights into both character's personal relationships \\"at home\\", without artificial drama.  Just contentment with real life.  The film tries very hard to give us visual cues to the place and times (through the decades), and it's beautiful!
B000M4RG42|3.0|We all love Clint, his movies and his acting. This was a good movie overall, but the only thing that ruined it was the profanity, especially the unneccesary language from the part played by Bud Gerber (John Slattery). Too much of \\"F\\" this, and \\"GD\\" that\\", along with others. I know this is war and almost anything goes, but I'm certain back in the 1940's the text was not used so freely as it is in todays society. Because of this, the movie doesn't make it real nor does it make the movie a good quality, it good have been better. Maybe someday a director will take more control of the dialog/script and make a great quality movie for all to see.
B002ZNJWI6|5.0|This was my first Alastair Reynolds book. I've been on a steady diet of Iain Banks with some Peter Watts for the past couple of years. Anyway, this book was awesome. Great plot and character set against momentous, galactic backdrop. The story suck me in within the first 50 pages or so. Also, some mind opening ideas throughout the book and great science (that Reynolds has a real science background certainly comes though, and I think it definitely helps the world-shaping). One of the themes is making me want to go read \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" by Jared Diamond. I'm ready to pick up my second Reynolds book!
0340822783|4.0|hehe, pretty clever eh?     Which leads me to where the author is clever, and perhaps less so. I enjoyed the structure of the novel, and the individual styles of each novella. I believe that the \\"Louisa Rey\\" one was \\"badly\\" written on purpose, and I dont mean badly in a harsh way, but it is rather un-inspiring in comparisson with the other 5, reflecting its \\"airport novel\\" genesis.     What perhaps let me down was the failure of the book to reveal any hidden mystery to me, I was left with the feeling that I had missed something obvious, but I read it again, and looked though many on-line fora and apparently not. Oh well. I would have liked perhaps more closure to the soul travelling though time element, and a weeny bit more backstory to the post apocalyptic stuff, but its a small bugbear.     This is a unique and interesting story, and recommended.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|First and foremost Dexter is a very entertaining addictive series and this was a great season in particular. The blu ray transfer quality is excellent. Picture and sound are superb. This is a five star no brainer except for one glaring weakness. If you don't have access to BD Live, in other words if you can't get online through your blu ray player, then there are absolutely no special features at all for the entire season. Not one single audio track commentary for any of the 12 episodes. Not a single \\"making of\\" featurette. Nothing. Now that's pretty pitiful for a show of this quality and popularity. When you plunk down a chunk of change for an entire high def season of a great show you expect to get some special feature goodies, and you should. Somebody at Paramount/Showtime dropped the ball. That's my only gripe. I've heard rumors that they got the message and season 4 will be loaded. I hope so because this show deserves the deluxe(Mad Men)treatment.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|There is little about Radiohead's seventh full-length album that will surprise the initiated, yet at the same time, there is something completely refreshing and utterly enjoyable about \\"In Rainbows.\\" This ten-track set was originally offered up for the low price of nothing (or whatever you preferred to pay) via download, but is certainly worth investing not just your money but your time in it as well.<br /><br />Restoring the band to perhaps their most organic (this word is being used very loosely here, mind you) since [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] or even [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], \\"In Rainbows\\"  doesn't challenge its built-in audience so much as it satisfies them. The other-wordly textures created by guitarist Jonny Greenwood infiltrate each and every track, accompanied by a quirky rhythm section (see: \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\") strings and some synth. Singer Thom Yorke seems to be putting in his most energetic performance in years (especially when compared to 2003's [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail to the Thief]]) and on tracks like the sublime \\"Nude\\" and the semi-ballad \\"All I Need\\" he becomes an insrument all his own, blending in with the lush soundscape at hand, rather than sticking out like a sore thumb as he had a tendency to on previous recordings. The band, on the other hand, sounds about as cohesive as ever, and in spite of some slick production, manage to give off almost a garage-band-like vibe on songs like \\"Reckoner\\" and \\"Bodysnatchers.\\"<br /><br />For Radiohead fans, \\"In Rainbows\\" is about as close to comfort-food as it comes. It's surprising and yet unassuming at the same time. While some of the band's finest work took multiple listens to reveal their genius, this is a rarity in that it hits almost immediately. The only complaint that could be found within is that it seems to end too soon. One can't help but feel like this is two or three songs short of a masterpiece. Even still, whatever price you pay, you'll find this to be an album well worth the price of admission and proof that you can make alternative rock alternative again. One has to wonder if Radiohead are self-aware or if they just happen to stumble on this sort of genius as some sort of happy accident. I like to think its the latter and am hopeful that luck will continue to shine on them again in the future.proof that you can make alternative rock alternative again.

This book traces his life and how it was shaped by incredibly hard work.   The book is well written and holds your interest from beginning to end.  It's the kind of book that when you read it, you think about the character for days afterward.  This book would be an excellent choice for any reader.
B002VECM6S|3.0|...from all the `unhelpful' votes I'm going to get because of this.<br /><br />Okay, let's forget the fact that Sandra Bullock should not have taken the Oscar from Carey Mulligan.  Let's forget the fact that the film itself had no place on Oscar's `Best Picture' ballot.  Let's just take a second to look at `The Blind Side' separated from the hype and the accolades and the attention and ponder on just what kind of film this really is.<br /><br />Okay, let's ponder over what kind of film I think this is.<br /><br />I went into `The Blind Side' thinking that it was going to be a sappy tear-jerker that pretty much had every clich&eacute; in the book and was basically carried by a single performance that made it worth watching.  What I got was sort of what I expected.  The film, thankfully, is no where near as sappy as it could have been, but it is littered (and I mean like inner-city trash dump littered) with clich&eacute;s and the performances in the film are near horrific, except for Sandra `I now have an Oscar' Bullock.<br /><br />Please understand that I ADORE Sandra Bullock and really think that the nomination was deserved (even if I wouldn't give her one) and was very happy for her when she won.<br /><br />Okay, here's the deal.  I liked this film.  It was good.  It was moving and touching and inspirational and really all those things you expect from a film like this.  That said, there is nothing original here and the way the film is constructed can, at times, teeter on annoying.  The film is a little too long for starters (the ending drags on a little too much) and there is a serious glimmer of `TV Movie of the Week' that runs through its veins.  The way that Michael's home life with the Tuohy's is established ran a little tired for me (I mean, I've seen this a million times before).  There just didn't seem to be much here to establish the film as memorable.<br /><br />I called every play so-to-speak before it came.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, I remember saying to my wife that the reason Sandra was toted as the best actress this year was because she starred in a film where no one else could act.  I mean, Sandra comes across like acting royalty when paired with a bunch of people who don't know what they are doing, and I'm not just talking about the principle players here.  Tim McGraw is the only one that really holds his own here (he has such natural charisma, and I told my wife when the film ended that I would not be surprised to see him Oscar nominated sometime this decade).  The fact remains that even the extra's here are atrocious.  The actresses who play Leigh Anne's lunch buddies for example are just ridiculous.  Their approach to acting is awkward and laughable.  The actress who plays the `investigator' in the end is also just plain awful.  And then you have the main actors in the film.  Quinton Aaron only knows one emotion, and he plays it awfully one-note at that.  There are no layers to him.  He just mopes.  Lily Collins is barely there (literally and figuratively) and Jae Head has to be the WORST child actor I've seen in a long time.  His performance was the single most obnoxious thing I've seen all year.  It was borderline repulsive.<br /><br />BUT, Sandra really does shine here.  Like I said, her nomination was deserved.  She understands how to build a real woman, with heart and soul but also with flaws.  She doesn't shy away from exposing her vanity, but she also establishes a believable layer of motherly adoration.<br /><br />You love this woman by the films end.<br /><br />So, before you hop all over that `unhelpful' button, realize that I'm not `not recommending' this film.  In fact, I am recommending it in the end.  Like I said, the film is good, and Sandra borders `great'.  No, I don't think that the film should have garnered all the attention and accolades it did, and for me the over-praise did kill some of my respect for the film (it has so many faults that it bothers me it was labeledone of the top ten best films of the year) but it is entertaining and emotionally connected and it does present the audience with am inspiration story worth hearing.<br /><br />So watch it, just don't expect it to be flawless.d and it does present the audience with am inspiration story worth hearing.    So watch it, just don't expect it to be flawless.
B001MS7IBS|3.0|The series builds into greatness through the first season -- but the discs themselves can be criticized for not offering much in the way of extras. Only three commentary tracks exist -- and oddly, the finale is NOT one of the episodes with a commentary track. One of three commentary tracks is with a roomful of writers who cut each other off as they try to out-clever each other, and they rarely get around to discussing the show. At one point they mention that the DVD producer is yelling in their earpieces for them to get on-topic. But they never do. Embarrassing. Also the bloopers reel is misnamed, as it primarily just features actors mugging for the camera, and a couple bad line readings -- but no hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Maybe a bit later on they can revisit the first season with better extras. But for now, buy it and enjoy the episodes themselves.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce has a huge following, and I get it.  I'm a fan, you could say.  I loved Destiny's Child back in the day (yes, I just used THAT phrase) and when she split I was intrigued.  I mean, she was never my favorite `Child' even though she was the only one that got any attention (MICHELLE, I LOVE YOU).  That said, she has spunk and style and swagger and she is a commanding presence.<br /><br />Her `Sasha Fierce' album is worth checking out, even if it is inconsistent.<br /><br />`Dangerously In Love' was her debut album, and it proves to be what we expect from her.  It's loud and boisterous and catchy and fun, but in the end it doesn't transcend anything, and when the years go by the album becomes a tad dusty.<br /><br />I mean, there really isn't any song off of here that can be considered `her best'.<br /><br />The album spurned a slew of radio hits like `Crazy in Love', `Naughty Girl' and `Baby Boy'.  They are all decent.  `Crazy in Love' is generic, but fun.  `Naughty Girl' is slinky and seductive in all the right places.  `Baby Boy' excels because of Sean Paul, but Beyonce does what she does rather well here as well.  Add to this mix the `Dangerously in Love 2' (which is NO different from the one on Destiny's Child's album) and you have the best on the album.  Sadly, the rest of the tracks pale in comparison (big time).<br /><br />`Hip Hop Star' is decent.  I like it, but it just doesn't really do much more than allow Big Boi to steal all of Beyonce's thunder.<br /><br />It's a `by-the-books' hip-hop track.<br /><br />The rest is generic pop/R&B fluff really.  It's rather forgettable.  `Be With You' is soft and has a glimmer of vintage R&B slink going on, but it is nothing memorable.  `Me, Myself and I' is, again, generic.  I mean, this is not a track to separate Beyonce from the pack.  `Yes' sounds too much like early Destiny's Child.  There is no progression of sound here.  `That's How You Like It' is fun and playful, if not a tad annoying in parts.  The duet with Vandross is far too `old' for the likes of Beyonce.  I feel like I sound like Simon Cowell, but it's true.<br /><br />That song ages her.<br /><br />`Signs' is GAWD-AWFUL, as are `Speachless' and `Gift From Virgo'.  These are just cheesy and forgettable (thankfully) tracks and `Signs' is just plain insulting to my taste.<br /><br />And that interlude is just stupid.<br /><br />I think that to call out the albums content as generic and a fault here would be rather harsh since there is only so much that musical acts within this particular genre sing about, but it is all about presentation here.  You can hear a million songs about heartbreak but if they are all sung convincingly and consist of noteworthy musical arrangements and intriguing lyrics than you can listen to a million GOOD songs about heartbreak.  When the songs are sung in a way that evokes no emotion and merely consist of recycled and uninspiring musical arrangements and lyrics that are forgettable and boring then you have a million MEDIOCRE songs about heartbreak.<br /><br />In the end I'd say, without hesitation, that this is Beyonce's weakest album.  There are a handful of good songs amidst a sea of mediocre ones.  Hey, I like her, and I totally recommend getting your hands on her other albums, but this one is a forgettable and generic album that doesn't do anything to help define Beyonce as an artist...if you dare to consider her one.I feel like I sound like Simon Cowell, but it's true.

I played the samples and recognized \\"Breakeven\\" from the radio and have not been disappointed! This is an album is full of infectious chorus's and has no tracks that need to be skipped during playback. \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" is a great story of a man attempting to find a girl he once met. Other highlights, \\"Before the Worst\\" and \\"Fall for Anything\\".

B000000OSO|4.0|`Get a Grip' inspires a tremendous amount of emotion for long time Aerosmith fans and unfortunately much of it is in the negative. The album was among the best selling records the band would ever produce and proved without a bit of doubt that they were hit makers par excellence.  The LP also proved that Aerosmith's late 80's renaissance had nothing to do with the hair metal craze of that era and that the band was above all that as their popularity only increased during the supposed grunge era which destroyed the children of Aerosmith but not the demon father himself. That `Get a Grip' contains some of the sappiest, pappiest music that the fellas would ever make was the bone of contention of the many who bought the LP in the spring of '93 after four long years. Almost twenty years later, some of the video hits are still a chore to listen to but taken as a whole, `Get a Grip' shows the old masters at the top of their form. Again working with Bruce Fairbairn and many of the hit makers (Desmond Child, Taylor Rhodes) who had worked with the band on the previous two records, Aerosmith at its core (Steven Tyler and Joe Perry) still had the basic songwriting chops that would tower over most of their contemporaries.  Favorites would include the title track, \\"Shut Up and Dance\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Flesh\\" and the feverish workout of \\"Eat the Rich\\". I have grown to appreciate \\"Amazing\\" more after I read about the song's genesis in the band's autobio `Walk This Way' and it really is a great song. \\"Livin' on the Edge\\" was a decent lead single but it tends to get a little repetitive towards the end. As far as the other big hits, the less said about them the better. `Get a Grip' can be appreciated years after rock radio and MTV basically turned Aerosmith's core fan base against them as sell outs but the fans will always come back and this record does give them enough. Something for everyone?
B002VECM4K|5.0|PRECIOUS BLU-RAY was a tough movie to watch. This is my second viewing, first was in the theater, but I knew that I had to have this treasure in my library.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1987 in Harlem, NY and is about a morbidly obese teenager who is abused sexually, physically, and emotionally by her mother. They live in poverty and Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones is semi-illiterate and pregnant for the second time by her biological father. She escapes into a world of fantasy to run from all the pain. After she gets sent to an alternative school and becomes inspired by a caring teacher and other girls who are in similar situations, her life goes from bad to worse--testing positive for HIV--but somehow \\"Precious\\" seems to find the strength to carry on.<br /><br />In the end, the movie leaves viewers with a very subtle but hopeful note that might even be missed. I certainly didn't get it on first viewing thinking how can this be an uplifting movie? But it was. Knowing that the main character, despite being all that she's been through, is focused on herself and creating the life she wants is really an uplifting message. Easy to say but harder to do, Claireece doesn't focus on all the bad things that have happened to her at the hands of someone else. Instead, this young warrior channels her energy into bettering herself and taking care of her kids.<br /><br />Gabourey Sidibe who portrays \\"Claireece Precious Jones\\" was remarkable in this emotionally challenging role. In the special features, Sidibe talks about how a friend recommended that she audition for the role to which she replied, \\"but I'm not an actress.\\" You couldn't tell that by this tour-de-force performance.<br /><br />And Mo'Nique deserved to win that Academy Award. She plays the abusive mother, \\"Mary Jones,\\" to the hilt! Although the role could have easily gone the way of camp (a la Faye Dunaway in [[ASIN:B000ERVJK4 Mommie Dearest (Hollywood Royalty/Special Collector's Edition)]]), Mo'Nique gives just enough to bring her character close to the edge, without going overboard, and becoming a true monster. Who knew that this funny lady could convincingly portray a character who is 180-degrees from her usual happy and comedic roles.<br /><br />As far as this movie reinforcing negative stereotypes, Mo'Nique responded eloquently when Barbara Walters asked the question and I'm paraphrasing, \\"This could  anybody's story. It just so happens that the characters are black (in Precious), but poverty and abuse can happen to anyone.\\" So true.<br /><br />Anyway, the PRECIOUS BLU-RAY has special features which are worth viewing as well:<br /><br />======  SPECIAL FEATURES  ======<br />*From Push To Precious* - 15:22-minutes - Featurette<br />Sapphire discusses how her book [[ASIN:0099548720 Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\"]] came to be, and the director of the movie Lee Daniels talks about bringing the novel to the screen.<br /><br />*Precious Ensemble* - 18:32-minutes  - Featurette<br />Discussion of the casting choices and includes Gabourey Sidibe (Precious), Mo'Nique (Mary), Mariah Carey (Mrs. Weiss), and Paula Patton (Ms. Rain).

This performance blew me away and Sidibe recreates this performance in the movie to the \\"tee.\\" Something that anyone who has studied method actingcan appreciate.<br /><br />*Deleted Scene: \\"Incest Survivor Meeting\\" - 01:45-minutes - Deleted Scene<br />Precious is taking part in the support group.

It's not about stereotypes, either the reinforcement or creation of. It's a story about one person's will to overcome huge obstacles despite the odds. PRECIOUS is a story that we might not hear about too often, but one that isn't as uncommon as we'd like to think.

B000002IJA|3.0|A curious collection to say the least, `Who Made Who' brought AC/DC into the movie business in the spring of 1986. As a soundtrack for the putrid film `Maximum Overdrive', the band had been asked by long time fan and horror meister Stephen King to supply his directorial debut with a bit of their trademark `thunder'.  The album was huge seller which was very curious in that it contains only three new songs; the anthemic title track and two instrumentals.  \\"Who Made Who\\", the song, became the band's biggest hit since \\"For Those About to Rock\\" which curiously enough is on the present album as was \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". Though the soundtrack included these heavy hits it would be wrong to consider `WHW' a greatest hits though many non fans probably bought it with that in mind.  A question might have been why no more originals, make it worth a real fan's purchase? Two from `Fly on the Wall' and `Ride On' complete the selection and that's what you have to consider this album as; almost a random of collection of AC/DC songs that King supposed chose himself.  Only for the fan that has to have it all or the casual fan but for someone who wants to seriously immerse themselves in prime AC/DC, you need to go deeper.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Having worked for a Canadian Beef producer utilizing a feed lot system, albeit some 35 years ago and on a significantly smaller scale than presented within Food, Inc., I am well aware of the challenges that Canadian farmers have faced. Even back then, there was concerns by the local farmers of the impact of the corporate farm on the food industry. I doubt any of them, however, would have imagined to what extent our Federal Governments would have facilitated the deterioration of public health and food safety in their support of corporate food production, over that of the family farm operation.    On a brighter note, I very much appreciated that there remains a glimmer of hope that we, as consumers, and in cooperation with the dedication and courage of individual farmers who are willing to speak up and return to traditional farming methods and values, have the power to right what has become an unimaginable wrong within North American society.    I found Food, Inc., to have offered a fair representation of food production in North America, and I urge every consumer to see this film.

0679882820|5.0|Everyone and their mother knows who Dr. Suess is.  I mean, his name is synonymous with `children's story' and rightfully so.  That said, this little treasure was not one that I was familiar with as a child, but it has quickly become my favorite.<br /><br />When my daughter was still learning to talk I would read this to her nearly everyday.  She adored the pictures and thought that the quick rhyming on the part of her daddy was pretty hilarious.  Soon she started to copy every sound I was making and then she began to memorize every sound, associated with each object and she would spit them out before I would.<br /><br />Now, at nearly three, she has memorized this entire book and reads it to me.<br /><br />This little gem is funny, witty and entertaining.  The artwork is what's to be expected from Dr. Suess; unique, strange and oddly vintage in character.  The tongue-twisting poetic nature of the dialog is fun and surprisingly easy to spit out.<br /><br />Easily one of my favorites from the master of children's literature!

B00004Z4WR|5.0|Some of you may feel like five stars is a lot for a film like `Gone in 60 Seconds'.  On most days I may agree with you.  The thing is, this film (as stupid as it may be at times) is so much fun and so incredibly watchable that I can't help but shower it with love.  Despite the fact that Nicholas Cage is one of my least favorite actors (although, shockingly, this is one of his best performances...maybe because he isn't over thinking it) this film satisfies all of my `adrenaline junkie entertainment' needs.<br /><br />And then some.<br /><br />I just adore this film.  I saw it quite a few times in the theater and I own it and watch it frequently.  It is one of those films that you don't need to ponder and you don't need to be in any specific mood to watch.  It won't `affect' you, but you shouldn't expect it to.<br /><br />It will entertain you, period.<br /><br />The film centers around two brothers, Randall and Kip.  Kip is hired to steal 50 cars for some guy, but when Kip screws up he finds himself writing his own death wish.  With no other choice, Kip yanks his more experienced brother Randall out of retirement to help him fulfill his quota.<br /><br />Insert a lot of attractive cars, one major attractive woman and a lot of cool car chase scenes and you have `Gone in 60 Seconds'.<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is fun.  Sure, there is better, and even in this genre there is better, but this was one of those films that really got me revved up when I was fifteen and it still continues to bring me back to that happy place.  With Ribisi, Jolie, Duvall, Lindo, Olyphant, McBride, Patton, Caan and, yes, Cage, `Gone in 60 Seconds' has a lot going for it, and it takes full advantage of that.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Yes, there are no singles on this album, which is going to be a shock (and a dissapointment) to a lot of fans of Oracular Spetacular, but this is an album that you cannot judge after one spin as it takes a while to sink in. But if you give it a chance it is a real grower and is easily the best album I have heard this year. Here is a brief breakdown....    1. It's Working - awesome, psychedelic tinged opener. Wouldn't be out of place on the second half of Oracular Spetacular.     2. Song For Dan Treacy - One of my favorites. It's not traditional pop per say and probably won't be played on the radio, but is very melodic even without a typical chorus.    3. Someone's Missing - The closest this album comes to a traditional single. Ends abruptly once the chorus kicks in at the end, but is still very good.     4. Flash Delerium - This is the first \\"single\\" off the album and when I heard it my initial reaction was \\"blah.\\" But this song sounds so much better in the context of the entire album and is now my personal favorite off the album.    5. I Found a Whistle - A nice, slow break proceeeding \\"Flash Delerium.\\" I imagine this will be the song that will cause the lighters and cell phones to come out during their concerts. Listen to the lyrics carefully. I assume the song is not referring to the \\"Phantom Menace,\\" but I wonder.....    6. Siberian Breaks - This is probably the song that will determine if you like the album or not. At 12 minutes long it is one of those songs that people are going to love and hate. It is really like 4 or 5 songs thrown together, but for whatever reason it completely works and is the heart of this album.     7. Brian Eno - An almost punk-type song dedicated to Brian Eno. Not quite made for radio, but along with \\"Someone's Missing,\\" it is one of the catchiest songs on the album.     8. Lady Dada's Nightmare - An instrumental and in my opinion the only mistep on the album. Not that it's bad, but it's not something you will want to listen to over and over and I would have much preferred a real, non-instrumental song, especially considering this is a short album at only 9 songs.     9. Congratulations - Great way to close out the album with probably the most traditional song MGMT has ever recorded. It is obviously meant to be a sarcastic reaction to the fame brought on by Oracular Spetacular, but is one of the best songs on the album regardless.     In closing, my only complain is that at 9 songs the album feels more like an EP then a full album. But even so, it is still so much better then most of the other crap out there these days. Give this one a chance, realize going in it is not Oracular Spetacular, and I have a feeling you will not be dissapointed
B0013K6WLM|5.0|This is a great record. If you're a Black Keys fan, don't skip out on this one, just be aware that it's different; and there's nothing wrong with that. But of course therein lies the problem. For some, 'different' means 'bad', when really all you need to do is give it a chance. Don't pidgeonhole your artists. Imagine if Led Zeppelin had never been experimental; it wasn't their dedication to tradition, but rather a willingness to transcend said tradition which made them so monumental. Thus far, none of the BK albums have sounded exactly alike, so if what you wanted was another 'Rubber Factory', unfortunately this is not the case. What you do get however, is a well paced, well written, and exquisitely produced record from one of the best bands in the world. And for anyone out there who thinks this record was \\"ruined\\" by Dangermouse, just be understanding that it was the BK that sought him out, and continue to work with him, so I'm pretty sure this was exactly what they wanted.
0060558121|1.0|I keep reading about how great Neil Gaiman is, and he's especially revered by some of my favorite authors (Patrick Rothfuss, for one). This was the first Gaiman book I've read, and it was terrible. Too weird, and his writing style is too often so ambiguous and intentionally vague with it's descriptions that I had a hard time understanding what was going on. I'm no dummy...I have advanced degrees and a high IQ...but I couldn't get a firm grasp on what was happening through most of the book. Just a big waste of time. I'll stick with Rothfuss, Hobb, Redick, etc. To each his own, I guess, but I just don't get it.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|As many have stated this is a marvelous set about WW-II.  The videos are truly breathtaking and give one a better understanding about what war is really like.<br /><br />My purpose in writing this review is to reiterate what some reviewers have stated and that is the shoddy sound quality.  In the first five videos one has to put up with Laurence Olivier's stunted delivery.  The man may have been a terrific actor but his delivery is so subdued and stilted that one has a difficult time hearing him.  Also Sir Olivier had a nasty habit of muting his voice during the last few words of his sentences thus making matters worse.  At times I got so irritated I almost threw a shoe at the TV.  In case you are wondering about my hearing, no, same story with my wife who has perfect hearing.<br /><br />However, the material is so good and so important that I recommend this set to anyone interested in history.  An important set with magnificent material that is a \\"must have\\" even with the poor sound quality.  Oh, by the way, there are no subtitles so if you have even moderate hearing loss you will be hard pressed to enjoy this set.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion is an amazing performer and as the world famous author--tag-along Richard Castle - he will definately make you laugh. Castle is truly a good spirited, kind-hearted almost rustic romantic with an incredibly human side. He is a very compassionate father and the victimized son of a long-term 'dedicated' actress mother. Besides writing murder mystery novels his new kick is trying not to be irritating - but often is - to Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), the NYPD detective. His inspiration for his next set of novels is Det. Becket. The chemistry between Fillion and Katic is eletric and humorous and defiantely organic. It was the charm of Murder She Wrote with the humor of Lou Grant meets House. Unlike most criminal investigation shows, Castle focuses on the story of the murder. The twist after twist after twist. What's really cool is the murderer is literally NEVER who you think it is. Great cast, great writing and just a lot of fun.<br /><br />The bonus materials include the behind the scenes interviews with the stars, out takes, deleted scenes, and more.<br /><br />This is a great family show. Fresh and fun adn has several of the producers from Star Trek: The Next Generation. So the writing is intelligent and thoughtful. A must for every fan of murder mystery television.  Lorenzo M.  (4-10)
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I will be the first person to say that I was not looking forward to Natalie's Big Return to music with as a double set of poems set to music. I thought, \\"Boring...\\" as soon as I read about it over the last few weeks and months. The CD arrived in the mail yesterday and I thought again, \\"I love you, Natalie...but this is going to stink...\\" Well...guess what? BOY, was I WRONG. I've listened to 'Leave Your Sleep' three times now, and I can't get enough of it!!! It's so all over the musical map. Hell, some of the songs are actually sort of SEXY! And Natalie's voice is so amazingly strong these days (not to mention, the wonderful front cover of her beautiful face!)    The record is mature, eclectic, thoughtful, diverse and a bit sexy all at once.     Welcome back, Natalie. You've been missed. Badly.

B0035F0MTG|5.0|DG recently lost its two superstar Chinese pianists, with Yundi (as he wants to be known) skipping to EMI and Lang Lang to Sony. they have the power to demand any terms they want, while DG must turn to a new crop of virtuosos. They've placed a good bet on Yuja Wang. Although marketed as sexy in this all-red cover photo, she has the technique to match her male rivals, a solid musical background form Curtis Institute, a famous teacher in Gary Graffman, and most important, real musical instincts.  The only drawback is that she has been launched internationally before her musical gifts have matured, but since when is that new?<br /><br />This, her second solo album, begins with a famous knuckle-cruncher, the Three Movement form Petrushka (1921), where we can compare her directly to Evgeny Kisisn and Maurizio Pollini. She bows to neither for technique, and her quick tempos are fearless. Pollini sounds ore aristocratic, Kisisn more grand, but Wang's light, sparkling rendition is more breathtaking because she really does make the technical hurdles seem effortless. This kind of control is jaw-dropping, for once giving meaning to that cliche. DG's sound is first-rate, and so is the piano she has chosen. By comparison, Pollini's piano sounds tinny and hard.<br /><br />I wish the rest of the program didn't seem like an audition for a piano competition, consisting of two delicate Scarlatti sonatas, the humongous Paganini Variations of Brahms, and as a taste treat at the end, Ravel's La valse. It wasn't necessary to display so methodically that Wang can cover all bases. that said, the Scarlatti is done with charm and an easy touch' not for her the brittle brilliance of Horowitz. Let me confess that my interest in Brahms's big-deal piano works is only passing. I've only paid attention to Kissin's version of the Paganini Variations. Wang is no less bravura, but she's agreeably light and focused where Kissin is serious and grandstanding.<br /><br />In fact, it's her fleeting touch that unites all the diverse pieces on this CD. by the time she arrives at La valse, the listener has caught on, and there's delight in appreciating such a mercurial artist. Wang is Argerich without fierceness.  so far as I know, Argerich has only given us a two-piano arrangement of Ravel's insidious, off-kilter, and ultimately harrowing imitation of Vienna. Wang's account isn't satirical or even very French, but it's so graceful and lyrical that no one could resist.  The same is true for the whole CD -- her future looks very bright.erse pieces on this CD. by the time she arrives at La valse, the listener has caught on, and there's delight in appreciating such a mercurial artist.

1582406723|5.0|The Walking Dead comic book series is one of the most well written and interesting piece of zombie literature out there. There are currently 10 mass market paperbacks out and it's still going strong. The story follows Rick, his family, and his band of random friends as they struggle to survive in a post-zombie apocalypse world. The characters are diverse in every way: in sex, race, age, and sanity.    As you probably know, many horror movies rely on the characters doing stupid things to move the plot ahead. This really isn't the case with The Walking Dead series. Of course the characters sometimes make fatal mistakes, but it isn't the main plot device. (I think it's wonderful that stupidity is swiftly punished in this world.) Problems in this world do not only stem from zombies. There are so many other things to worry about: food, shelter, raising children, inner group conflicts, and even other humans.    Sometimes, encountering other humans is much more dangerous than any zombie. Keep in mind that there is no longer any government, laws or regulations to follow. People can essentially do whatever they want without any repercussions. I think this is the scariest aspect of this world. Some people turn into complete monsters and do terrible things. Even the main characters have to struggle with their own humanity because they are surrounded by so much violence and gore.    No character is safe in this series. Anyone could die at any time for any reason. The deaths are unexpected and often pretty brutal. I like this unpredictability because it keeps my interest and makes me want to know more after I read each issue. The only problem with this series is that the mass market paperbacks don't come out as often as I would like. I would recommend this series to any zombie fan. If you don't usually read comic books, please give this one a try. You won't be disappointed.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire starts where The Hunger Games leaves off. Katniss and Peeta have to go on tour and act deliriously in love with each other. They have to convince the Capitol and President Snow that the outcome of the Hunger Games was an act of love, not a subversive act of rebellion. However it was meant, the effect reverberates throughout the districts, whether they view the couple as star-crossed lovers or rebel icons. Is Katniss's façade convincing enough and how long will she have to keep it up? Also, what other horrors is the next Hunger Games, the Quarter Quell, going to bring?<br /><br />When I read The Hunger Games, I liked it, but considered it a watered down version of Battle Royale. Catching Fire, however, elevates the series for me and leaves Battle Royale in the dust. This novel shows what happens after the Hunger Games are over. If you think the victors are safe and the trouble is over, you are very, very wrong.<br /><br />The tour that takes Peeta and Katniss to the other districts illuminates the drastic difference between the rich and poor districts. The setting for the novel is in the future, so these people have many more luxuries and technology than we have. The Capitol is the height of luxury. Its inhabitants have shallow, materialistic worries and have more food than they know what to do with. At parties, it's typical to see people induce vomiting multiple times to stuff themselves with more of the extravagant food. They have no idea about the hardships the other districts deal with every day. These districts are the polar opposite of the Capitol. If I hadn't known the setting for the novel, I would have thought that the poorer districts were stuck back in time, being deprived of the luxuries of our own time. It's shocking to me that despite all their amenities and technological advances that people are still left to starve or die from very curable afflictions.<br /><br />This book is much more brutal than the last. Because of Peeta and Katniss's gesture, the police are overpowering the more rebellious districts with beatings, torture, and even killings. I was on the edge of tears for most of the novel, but I was pleased to see a young adult novel push the envelope far beyond what I thought possible. President Snow is one of the cruelest characters I have ever encountered in literature. I was so surprised by the twists and turns of the plot and eventually just gave up trying to predict what was going to happen. The shocks just keep coming, right up to the very last page. I highly recommend this novel and I can't wait for the next one!gesture, the police are overpowering the more rebellious districts with beatings, torture, and even killings.

I've been able to get through 2.5 sequences and am left panting on the floor thinking 'next time'. Jillian is great, the ambiance is quaint (studio), and the routines are effective.

B000W91RUG|2.0|No offense to the lovers of this show. I had big expectations for this series as many people recommended this as being an original knock-down funny comedy. I'm struggling through the 1st season and finding very little originality in it's writing. I've caught myself, on more than one occasion, predicting the replies of characters during dialogue simply because I find it's a very common thread-line type of humor. I recognize that comedy is a \\"to each his/her own\\", but wow, I'm just not seeing the humor with this show.       I keep seeing this as a very poor-man's version (very poor) of Seinfeld. Laugh tracks are obnoxious, settings & characters appear to be birthed from Seinfeld,... only not funny. Character development is really shallow if any.      I see the same attempted humor/plot over and over again just worded differently. Ok, I get it, geeks struggling to adjust to what is considered normal....tossing the viewer like a vollyball between the two. Insulting laugh tracks that were created (by all programs using them) to instruct the viewer they should be laughing are really obnoxious when one doesn't find anything funny of laughing at. I love good comedy with a indepth script, (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Weeds (season 1 & 2 only), Californication) which creates a wonderful release. (Take heart fans of this show, if it's any consultation I also find 30 Rock not funny)        D+
0345495004|4.0|Nancy Horan explores the fascinating subject of Mamah Borthwich Cheney and her relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright in her 2007 book, \\"Loving Frank\\". This novel is based on true events and is extremely well researched. Ms. Horan uses many little known facts to enliven the relatively unknown and truly remarkable story of an affair that had enormous repercussions for, and a huge emotional and creative impact on, one of America's best known artists.     Unlike some historical novels which simply hang a story on a historical setting, this story is soundly grounded on historical facts. Of course Ms. Horan takes some liberties in order to move the narrative along, but she has researched her subjects and makes none of the incredible leaps in plot or logic that are so common in this type of writing.  While keeping her conjectures reasonable, Ms. Horan still manages to make the story move forward smoothly. She fills out the motivations and emotions of the characters so well that the reader can have a certain degree of empathy for all of them, with one exception that is obvious to anyone who knows the story.    Often times in historical novels the subject chosen is obscure. The subject of \\"Loving Frank\\" was able to be thoroughly studied. Ms. Horan was able to write so convincingly about her subjects' motivations and actions, in part, because she was able to find information that was contemporary to their story.     Ms. Horan vividly describes life in the early 1900's for a well-educated and free thinking woman and interprets for us the thoughts and emotions that that could have influenced her actions. She uses authentic language that helps the reader to hear the true voice of the characters. With the setting in the not so distant past she is able to do this without creating a barrier to her audience. Many historical fiction authors do not have this option, because they are focused in a time period where the use of authentic language would be an impediment to readers.    As aresident of a Chicago suburb, Ms. Horan must have often heard varying opinions about the relationship of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney. As a journalist, she would have been motivated by curiosity and professional integrity to learn as much as she could on the subject before presenting it to her audience. This brought out a well researched, well presented, and well written book on a very intriguing topic that was a pleasure to read.

B000000ZKD|5.0|This is a really  nice Booker T tribute to the Beatles and simple one of the best. I do agree that the organ tends to overpower the other instruments at part, but the entire MGs are all centered around the unique organ sound that most bands don't have. There are a lot of awesome solos, and ends very strong. It does get kind of weak on tracks 2 and 3 but ends strong on the final track.
0061914177|5.0|I learned so much from this book!  Gary Vaynerchuk is such a breath of fresh air.  He has been unimaginably successful in business, and he's willing to share what he has learned with anyone who cares enough to listen.  Great advise on personal branding an on marketing via social media.  I personally enjoy the first person accounts of the moves the author made to grow equity in his own brand and his business. He further expands the scope of this book by explaining exactly how he would follow similar strategies if he were in other lines of work--great stuff!    This book is a quick and invaluable read if you are interested in the concepts behind building personal brands.  Gary Vaynerchuk has been there, done that, and most important, is will to share.

I have family who fought in this war and to this day they will not talk about what happened in Guadalcanal. The great thing about both series is it gives us an up close and personal look at the war and the brave ones who fought in it and when I think about it  how can we say one show was better then the other when this is based on actual events so I change my review by saying both Band of brothers and The Pacific are amazing.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Releases by Natalie have been few and far between since she left 10,000 Maniacs, so the release of the first new material in 7 years will be welcome news to her fans. Natalie is now signed to the Nonesuch label and this album is available in 2 different versions. A 2 disc set [the Complete Works] and a [[ASIN:B002VZC9CY Selections from the Album Leave Your Sleep]] [Selections from it] . Initially Natalie wanted to release it in two separate volumes, but the record label decided it would be better to release it as a double album - as it currently sits so high in the Amazon charts the marketing men obviously got this right. I think there will be a lot of people who will turn their nose up at this because of what it is percieved to be - childrens poetry set to music. But anyone who has heard any tracks from it will be pleasantly surprised.     That music and poetry should meet at some point is not a surprise. There has over the years been a number of musical projects related to the work of different poets, I can think of the \\"Now & In Time to Be\\" project that featured the works of WB Yeats or Rufus Wainwright recent trips into Shakespeare territory. And now we have this release. An initial glimpse at the poets involved lead to the thought \\"who be them?\\" as I had never heard of many of them before, but dont let that put you off.      This is not an album for children. It is at some level an album about childhood. From Natalie's own words it features poetry \\"about, for or by children\\" and \\"a child's emergence into the world of language\\". It may well appeal to children, but it is, as far from, a kids record as you can imagine. The complexities of the arrangements and the music itself make it something far more mature, almost encyclopedic in its exploration of different musical genres. It really is an amazing record. Many of these poems, taken at face value, you think could have never made an interesting song. But how wrong you would be. All the songs seem to have a life of their own. Even when the lyrics seem throwaway, the final finished song is not, and that says so much about Natalie's skill and ability, as an arranger and vocalist.      Some of the songs that stand out for me are - \\"Nursery Rhyme of Innocence\\" a poem about a child verging on adulthood, not a kids song at all, recorded with the wonderful Irish band Lúnasa. It has a deeply celtic feel to it, and sounds like it has always been destined to be a traditional folk ballad. \\"Isabel\\" has a real rollicking old-timey stringband feel to it, with lovely fiddle, banjo and guitar playing. The song  \\"It makes a change\\" almost has a late 1960 English pop feel to it. For some reason it reminds me of the Beatles. \\"Bleezer's ice cream\\" has a bouncey/jazzy setting to it, while the song \\"The peppery man\\" goes for a very deep south bluesy/jazz backing - with Waits-ian beat and brass section and gospel-like harmonies. \\"The King of China's daughter\\" takes us too a sound that seems totally Chinese, accompanied by traditional instruments and players, again with lovely harmonies. There is a very nice video of this on Natalie's website. \\"If no one marries me\\" has a very haunting acoustic sound allowing the lyrics to stand out. \\"Spring and fall\\" reminds me of something that Kate Bush might record and has a very sad orchestral sound. You almost need to keep a checklist for the genres this album delves into.    There is a very dreamy quality to much the album - the songs and lyrics have innocence to them at one level but on some levels a darkness and melancholy to them. Some of the lyrics maybe nonsense, but there are couplets from them, which make sense and strike a cord with the listener. As well as painting very vivid images in the imagination. The album covers such a wide variety of musical genres that its suprising it holds together so well as a single work, but that is down to Natalie's voice which has never sounded better. Her voice is so clear and restrained and has a beautiful vibe toit. You can almost sense that she is singing to, or with, her daughter.    Natalie's belief in this project is to be commended, she funded the project herself, in order to maintain control and retain the rights over the music.

So I imagine there is a possibilty there may be a volume 2 at some point in the future, especially as this looks destined to be a great success, and I for one would be over the moon!

B001PJRAUS|1.0|I wanted to like this.  The premise sounded fun and original!  THEN I watched it.  UGH!  To quote Florida Evans from 'Good Times', \\"Damn, damn, damn!!!\\"    An overly-long, rude, ridiculous piece of garbage.  The characters are NOT the P&P characters we know and love.  And the protagonists...YUCK.  Darcy decides he loves that sleazy, lying goofball Amanda, then changes his mind, then he loves her again, then changes his mind...and on it goes.  And Amanda walks around in some sleazy outfit, while the Bennett girls barely bat an eyelash...as if they wouldn't be completely scandalised by her lack of appropriate clothes.  The whole idea is so insane.      Like I said, I SO wanted to like this.  Who wouldn't love to step into P&P and have Darcy fall in love with them?  But this...this movie was SO ridiculous, I AM SO GLAD I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend money on this trash!!!!
B002VZC9CY|5.0|Releases by Natalie have been few and far between since she left 10,000 Maniacs, so the release of the first new material in 7 years will be welcome news to her fans. Natalie is now signed to the Nonesuch label and this album is available in 2 different versions. A [[ASIN:B002ZCDR88 Leave Your Sleep (2CD)]] [the Complete Works] and a single disc release [Selections from it] . Initially Natalie wanted to release it in two separate volumes, but the record label decided it would be better to release it as a double album - as it currently sits so high in the Amazon charts the marketing men obviously got this right. I think there will be a lot of people who will turn their nose up at this because of what it is percieved to be - childrens poetry set to music. But anyone who has heard any tracks from it will be pleasantly surprised.     That music and poetry should meet at some point is not a surprise. There has over the years been a number of musical projects related to the work of different poets, I can think of the \\"Now & In Time to Be\\" project that featured the works of WB Yeats or Rufus Wainwright recent trips into Shakespeare territory. And now we have this release. An initial glimpse at the poets involved lead to the thought \\"who be them?\\" as I had never heard of many of them before, but dont let that put you off.      This is not an album for children. It is at some level an album about childhood. From Natalie's own words it features poetry \\"about, for or by children\\" and \\"a child's emergence into the world of language\\". It may well appeal to children, but it is, as far from, a kids record as you can imagine. The complexities of the arrangements and the music itself make it something far more mature, almost encyclopedic in its exploration of different musical genres. It really is an amazing record. Many of these poems, taken at face value, you think could have never made an interesting song. But how wrong you would be. All the songs seem to have a life of their own. Even when the lyrics seem throwaway, the final finished song is not, and that says so much about Natalie's skill and ability, as an arranger and vocalist.      Some of the songs that stand out for me are - \\"Nursery Rhyme of Innocence\\" a poem about a child verging on adulthood, not a kids song at all, recorded with the wonderful Irish band Lúnasa. It has a deeply celtic feel to it, and sounds like it has always been destined to be a traditional folk ballad. \\"Isabel\\" has a real rollicking old-timey stringband feel to it, with lovely fiddle, banjo and guitar playing. The song  \\"It makes a change\\" almost has a late 1960 English pop feel to it. For some reason it reminds me of the Beatles. \\"Bleezer's ice cream\\" has a bouncey/jazzy setting to it, while the song \\"The peppery man\\" goes for a very deep south bluesy/jazz backing - with Waits-ian beat and brass section and gospel-like harmonies. \\"The King of China's daughter\\" takes us too a sound that seems totally Chinese, accompanied by traditional instruments and players, again with lovely harmonies. There is a very nice video of this on Natalie's website. \\"If no one marries me\\" has a very haunting acoustic sound allowing the lyrics to stand out. \\"Spring and fall\\" reminds me of something that Kate Bush might record and has a very sad orchestral sound. You almost need to keep a checklist for the genres this album delves into.    There is a very dreamy quality to much the album - the songs and lyrics have innocence to them at one level but on some levels a darkness and melancholy to them. Some of the lyrics maybe nonsense, but there are couplets from them, which make sense and strike a cord with the listener. As well as painting very vivid images in the imagination. The album covers such a wide variety of musical genres that its suprising it holds together so well as a single work, but that is down to Natalie's voice which has never sounded better. Her voice is so clear and restrained and has a beautiful vibe to it. You can almost sense that she is singing to, or with, her daughter.    Natalie's belief in this project is to be commended, she funded the project herself, in order to maintain control and retain the rights over the music. Natalie is on record as saying she actually had 50 songs prepared for the project and these are the final 26 she chose for the project.

142313494X|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians #1: The Lightening Thief, by Rick Riordan<br /><br />Okay, I admit I wasn't too sure of the Percy Jackson books. I'd ignored them for a long time, thinking the hype was silly, but when I found the first 3 in the series for a good price I couldn't resist.<br /><br />And wow! I regret not jumping on the Olympian bandwagon earlier, because I've been missing out on one fantastic series. Riordan's writing is witty, detailed, humorous, thrilling, mysterious, and about any other adjective I could think of. His is the kind of writing I would love to see in adult fantasy books, but rarely find.<br /><br />Percy Jackson isn't your typical hero. He's dyslexic, ADHD, and a bit of a troublemaker. Percy's been kicked out of every school he's ever attended, usually for something beyond his control, such as the time he hit his schoolbus with a Revolutionary War cannonball.<br /><br />The book is written as if Percy is talking to the reader; \\"The Lightening Thief\\" starts with him warning readers to be careful if they're half-bloods, or to read on for some good fiction if they aren't. It's a good style that lets Percy share his thoughts and feelings with the audience, and really gets readers inside his head.<br /><br />\\"The Lightening Thief\\" follows Percy as he learns he is a half-blood, a demigod who is half human and half Greek god. His status gives him some unique abilities, but unlike gods he is mortal and can be killed. Yet Percy is often willing to risk his life for those he calls friends. At Camp Half-Blood, the summer camp for young demigods, Percy and others like him learn to read Ancient Greek, to fight with swords, archery, and to do a hundred other things I'm jealous of. Camp Half-Blood sounds like a really fun place, and Riordan describes it well.<br /><br />Percy feels at home in Camp Half-Blood, but he doesn't get to enjoy it long. Soon after his arrival, he is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent war on Mount Olympus. Percy sets off with Grover, a satyr, and Annabeth, a daughter of Artemis, on an adventure that will delight readers, young and old.<br /><br />Immediately after finishing \\"The Lightning Thief,\\" I recommended it to a few friends. I think Percy Jackon and the Olympians is an incredible series, and one that I will reread endlessly. There's not a thing I would change about this book!<br /><br />5/5.d Annabeth, a daughter of Artemis, on an adventure that will delight readers, young and old.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is a DVD I get out when I am feeling bad or need to just zone out for a while and be completely amazed.  The Dangerous tour era is definitely my favorite time in MJ's career.  It is so bittersweet to watch him.  This live performance is magic.  Totally worth having.  Its ageless.  Michael Jackson's talent is definitely ageless as well.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Ordered the PX21's after reading reviews from many sites. First off, the hiss people are talking about is not an issue. It is very low and goes away when you listen to music or play a game. Hook up and the settings were very easy for my PS3. They fit very well and the mic works great, and they sound great. The only thing I wish they had was a jack to remove the head set and control from the cord for easier storage. You can't go wrong with the PX21's.<br /><br />Update 1: The wires to the control unit are shorting out. I would not buy them again.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and never saw it again until about a week ago when we bought the DVD. This was one of the best gifts to myself that I have bought in a long time. I had forgotten how uplifting and charming the movie was even in spite of the terrible things that happened in the Holocaust. It was moving and such a gift for my boyfriend and I to watch this together as I had previously seen it years ago with a friend. It got us talking and re-connecting and reminded us of the romance from when we first started dating (like the characters in the movie who flirt and fall in love) as we just got back together after time apart.     GREAT movie. Thank you for reminding me how beautiful life really is.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|It didn't take long for me to come to the conclusion that \\"Breaking Bad\\" is one of the best shows I've seen since HBO's \\"The Wire,\\" and that's no easy feat considering I came to this realization during the first season that was only 7 episodes long (due to the writer's strike).  Those 7 episodes were more than enough to get me hooked.  Well, I have finished the second season and I still hold that very same conclusion.  This season is longer, darker and even more devastating--while still containing all of the dark comedy/humor of Season 1.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a long synopsis of the show or season.  There are a lot of surprises and secrets and I would never forgive myself for giving any of them away.  I will be brief about describing the season:  Walt and Jesse get deeper and deeper into the dark and unforgiving drug world that knows of no innocent victims, and every step of the way only gives way to more complications and dangerous predicaments.  While Walt has always participated in this new illegal enterprise with the only reason being that he wants his family to have something after he dies (especially with a new bouncing baby on the way), his moral compass is pushed further and further and he starts to realize that there is a part of him, as much as he doesn't want to admit it, that actually enjoys doing it.  With this season it is more difficult than ever to continue with the lies to keep his family out of the loop... not to mention, keeping them safe.  This season, it's all about chain reactions.  Every act can, and will, create a consequence.<br /><br />Once again, I found myself invested with the storylines and characters.  I don't think there is an episode where I didn't feel some kind of tension or fear for what could happen next.  A show like this is very hard to pull off and it would be impossible to do so if it wasn't for the terrific writing, directing and casting.  Bryan Cranston is a force to be reckoned with and although his character is growing darker and scarier layers, he is still very much human and you care about him even if he's doing terrible things.  He's not some emotionless or flat character who craves power, and that's what makes the transformation all the more terrifying and heartbreaking.  I also have to say that even though he was outstanding in the first season, Aaron Paul really shines more than ever as \\"Pinkman\\" in Season 2 and there is an episode called \\"Peekaboo\\" where he completely owns every frame.  It is one of his best performances ever and this is his best season.<br /><br />The Blu Ray editon of Season 2 looks and sounds fantastic.  There are TONS of extra features to play around with such as commentary, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, webisodes and much, much more.  You won't find this package to be lacking, that much is for sure.<br /><br />The second season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" once again shows us a show that doesn't cut corners or slack in any way.  Every episode is engaging, tense and masterful.  The show continues to be filled with drama, suspense and humor.  If you were a fan of the first season then chances are that you will love what lies ahead in Season 2.  Moving up in the drug world ain't easy, and Walt and Jesse are about to find that out the hard way.

0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day describes the road trip of an English butler, Stevens, who seems to be approaching the end of a very long career.  The entire novel is written as several letters to an anonymous recipient.  The span of the narration is only a week in 1956, though much of Stevens' prior life is revealed through flashbacks to the late 30s when he served as butler to Lord Darlington.  As the flashbacks continue it becomes clear to the reader that Stevens' devotion to Lord Darlington caused him to make choices that he now regrets, and the title phrase \\"the remains of the day\\" seems to refer to this moment of reflection in the autumn of his life and career.  Before the war Lord Darlington showed much sympathy toward Germany and was involved in right-wing extremist groups, but because of his unswerving loyalty and sense of dignity in his work, Stevens is unable to express any condemnation of these actions and even in 1956 cannot fully express his own views on the matter.     Much of the focus of the plot rests on Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall during the late 30s who has recently written to Stevens, expressing a hint of unhappiness in her married life.  As a result, Stevens travels to visit her, ostensibly under the premise of asking her to return to Darlington Hall as housekeeper, but as the novel continues it becomes clear that either character had strong feelings toward the other, but because of their commitment to Lord Darlington and their careers in service, they were unable to express it.  Their relationship in the flashbacks always remains cordial and professional, but there are many moments of subtle and distinct attraction.   To reveal the plot any further would be to ruin for a potential reader a deeply satisfying novel.  The Remains of the Day is Ishiguro's third novel, and in addition to being awarded the 1989 Booker Prize, it has been named on several lists of \\"100 Greatest Novels,\\" and was adapted into a Merchant Ivoryfilm in 1993.  Beyond all accolades, the historical context of the novel adds a pervading sense of foreboding that provides for a thrilling story without resorting to typical features of \\"thriller\\" genre novels.  In many ways the entire plot is constructed of one moment of tension and constraint after another, and there are so many situations in which the reader wants to simply shake Stevens for his lack of emotional depth and expression.  The prose is elegant and equally restrained, and in many ways reflects the quiet dignity of the man it is describing.   While it is certainly a novel that could be enjoyed by many different types of readers, it serves as an excellent counterpoint to works like Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited or Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca, both of which describe life in a traditional English manor from the perspective of an outsider, much like The Remains of the Day.

No wonder our children in each future generation seem to be plagued by more and more ailments and diseases. If truth were to be told about the chemicals being put into our processed foods; acutally all foods, even those grown on corporate farms, since chemicals are used in animal food and on foods grown in the fields...it is safe to say we would be hard pressed as to what to eat at all.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I've been a fan of Doctor Who since I was a kid and discovered Tom Baker's version with the long scarf on Saturday afternoons on PBS.  I was crazy about the show all through high school and into college, but lost touch with it when it disappeared off the local PBS channel sometime in Colin Baker's run.  The 1996 attempt to revive it was a huge disappointment, so my anticipation of the new series was hesitant.    However, I was completely won over by Russel T. Davies' version as played by Christopher Eccleston.  I worried needlessly about transitioning to David Tennant after only one series, and the show has yet to seriously let me down, other than a few mediocre episodes here and there, but the good and the great far outshine the not-so-great.    Series 4 is the first one I've owned outright, simply because for whatever reason it has gone on sale at a deeper discount than the others!  I plan to own the others eventually as well because these are great packages with all the episodes complete and uninterrupted (and not cut to fit SyFy/BBCAmerica's time slots with commercials), and lots of extras.  I would love to have more episode-by-episode commentary but the extras that are available are quite fun.    As for this particular season, I was dismayed at the mention of Catherine Tate as the new companion because I didn't like the Runaway Bride episode much and she didn't do much but scream and yell.  Had enough of those sorts of companions over the years.  But she definitely grows on me in this series, and the lack of romantic mooning on the part of either character was a nice change of pace (despite the fact that I enjoy the \\"shipping\\" of the characters as well).  Having watched Catherine Tate's comedy show, her abilities as a dramatic actor were truly a revelation, and when her trip with the Doctor came to an end I was genuinely sad to see her go.    And now I am eagerly awaiting the next incarnation in series 5!

B003405MF6|3.0|I'd like to temper the (to me) wild over-enthusiasm for this new Jeff Beck CD with an alternative point of view.  The album has some great moments, such as the way \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" segues into a very strong, bluesy bit of electric guitar wizardry, \\"Hammerhead.\\"  I also enjoyed Beck's interpretations of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" and \\"Nessun Dorma.\\"  However, not every song on this CD is as good.  In particular, \\"Serene\\" sounds like a routine Smooth Jazz instrumental (with wordless backing vocals) and the 2nd Joss Stone number is just a lot of shrieking and wailing (from both Beck & Stone).  The closing number, \\"Elegy For Dunkirk,\\" wants to be a profound and moving piece in the mold of Barber's Adagio, but it just ended up being kind of boring to my ears.  I've listened to Blow By Blow many times in my life and loved it each time; this is no Blow By Blow.<br /><br />For those who believe firmly that Jeff Beck can do no wrong, I'm guessing my review has made you very angry.  Sorry about that.  You can click \\"no\\" now.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|The movie came out. I work in an elementary school and am surrounded by kids constantly, so naturally I have to go see the cool (and quality) movies that excite the kids (and this one looked pretty good.) So I went to the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed the enchanting story and incredible imagination. So no disrepect to those aspects of the movie whatsoever.<br /><br />BUT I firmly believe this movie would have not been what it was without the score. I can't remember the time I had heard a score that so well matched the story and emotion of a film. This movie is loosely based on a children's book and I think the music somehow brought along that literary magic. Just listen to the music and you can tell more or less what part of the movie it is. I remember sitting in the theatre, stunned at how well this music supported the story.<br /><br />Thus, I am calling this storybook music. It's sweet, simple, and all the while completely joyous/powerful/sad/whatever the occassion called for. A little Celtic touch completes the magic, not to mention those certain chords tying all the pieces together. I left the theatre believing the music was the best part of an already awesome movie and downloaded the album.<br /><br />And here is an example of this music's power: My classroom, last week, was painted and recarpeted. This of course meant that moving back in was hell and at this time I still don't know where a quarter of my things are--including the CD player used for listening centers, story readings, and the five minutes after recess where I play instrumental music to calm down the kids. So instead I pulled out my music-playing phone and turned up the volume on this album. Every student who had seen the movie IMMEDIATELY recognized what the music was (and became very excited and defeated the purpose of the calming down period).<br /><br />If squirrly first graders are touched enough by this music to recognize it, well, I can't tell you a more powerful testimony.

B00004YB9Y|4.0|I've never actually seen the video version of this particular Three Tenors project, and in fact only got around to listening to the CD relatively recently (when I was given a slew of holiday albums this past winter).  I can't help wondering if I wouldn't appreciated the DVD more.  The Tenors concerts always seemed to have their moments of greatness--and their moments of kitsch.  But they were live events, and in such situations, one tends to be generous and accepting of the inevitable highs and lows.  That's especially the case of \\"side projects,\\" like this one: you need more than a few grains of salt.  I wouldn't accuse the singers of not taking the project seriously, but do any of the artists involved devote the same level of care to these efforts as they do to their solo projects or to an appearance in a staged operatic work?    If the listener keeps these truths in mind, he or she will find to find much to enjoy with any Three Tenors project.  The holiday record was likely inevitable, and the selections, by and large, predictable.   There are the classical pieces, of course, and the obligatory popular holiday standards.  This type of mix CAN work, but just as often, it displays the singers' weaknesses will be thrown into stark relief with their considerable strengths. American songbook standards like \\"White Christmas\\" are so steeped in idiomatic English language works that non-native singers are going to struggle with them.  And classically trained singers are likely going to oversing them (as happens here). It's almost a kind of overcompensation.      Y'know,  Frank's daughter Nancy once told him not to stop comparing himself (negatively) with the great classical singers because none of them could do Sinatra like Sinatra. She was onto something.  Even though \\"White Christmas\\" is associated more frequently with Crosby,  Ol' Blue Eyes DID manage quite a credible version many years ago.  The Tenors do not.  It's not just the mispronounced English (\\"MY your days bemerry and bright,\\" being but one example): it's the entire \\"feel\\" of the song.      And if the holiday edition of the Great American Songbook is scarcely the Tenors' forte, then it's hard to know what to even begin to say about their attempt at a John Lennon tune.  I admire their willingness to take on the challenge of \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\\" but the reading is waaay off. Who'd have thought that there could ever be a context in which one could say that Yoko Ono could perform a song better than the Three Tenors?        They fare better with a simple, spiritual like \\"Amazing Grace.\\"  It's go more fireworks than your typical take on that song, but it's still respectful of the text, and really quite touching.    I'm not a musical snob, but I may well be a language one.  Of the three singers, it's pretty clear that Placido Domingo is the most comfortable with the demands of the English language: Pavarotti the least so.  Domingo is also pretty authoritative in his readings of German texts, although he does seem to have difficulty with the \\"short\\" vowels so common in Germanic languages  (\\"Chreestmas\\").   Pavarotti, it seems, was born to bring out the glories of his native language, and the Italian selections come off brialliantly.  One could say the same about the two Spanish born singers with their interpretations of the Spanish language offerings.      Actually, all three singers handle the Romance language texts effectively, and I guess that shouldn't be all that surprising.   But \\"Sleigh Ride\\"?  \\"Winter Wonderland\\"?  Like \\"White Christmas,\\" these are little musical Christmas cards. Operatic bombast only makes them border on the ridiculous.  It's sweet in a way--or maybe just good marketing--that the singers want to honor the popular classics of a country that has embraced them so thoroughly.  Too bad it doesn't work.    To sum up: \\"Wiegenlied,\\" \\"Ave Maria, Dolce Maria\\" \\"Tu Descendi Dalle Stelle,\\"  \\"Dormi, O Bambino\\" and others obviously closer to the actual heartsof the singers, all very good.  \\"White Chistmas,\\" \\"Sleigh Ride,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland\\"--well, not so much.
B000021XR5|3.0|That's what Scott Weiland said of this album back in 1998 before its release. Well, it scored a bunch of major hits for the band, but I'm not sure it quite attained the lofty status they were hoping.    With the release of their sixth studio album (first in 9 years) growing closer by the day, I find myself revisiting a lot of their back catalog. Very few rock bands out of the 90s have quite as solid a library packed with as many timeless hits as STP. \\"No. 4\\" does its fair share to contribute to the legacy, but comes up a little short in the long run.    Campaigned as a \\"back to basics\\" rock record, \\"No. 4\\" is about as similar an album to \\"Core\\" as any, and that's really the only problem here. \\"No. 4\\" doesn't break any new ground, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing for straight-ahead rock fans, while listening I often find myself longing for the one-two power punch of \\"Purple\\" or the eclectic diversity of \\"Tiny Music...\\"; both of which are solid five-star records.     All that said, the music here is actually really good for the most part despite its, uh, \\"familiar\\" sound. \\"Down,\\" \\"No Way Out,\\" \\"Glide,\\" and \\"Pruno\\" are as good as any of band's singles and even though I'm not personally a fan, \\"Sour Girl\\" scored STP possibly their biggest hit ever. At least \\"No. 4\\" is nothing if not consistent, though a few of the tunes here are just a little TOO generic for my liking (\\"I Got You,\\" \\"Church on Tuesday\\") and usually are met with the >> button on my CD player.    The only other real detriment to \\"No. 4\\" comes in the form of muddy production. I'm not really sure what the deal is there as the album was produced by the same guy that did their other four records. The others all have a crisp, clean sound (over-the-top production on \\"Core\\" aside) that is sorely lacking here.    \\"No. 4\\" is a good rock record, one that's easy to get into and one fans of STP definitely should pick up. On the other hand, newcomers looking for an introduction to STP would do best to startwith one of the first three albums as \\"No. 4\\" might give one the wrong impression on what these guys are truly capable of. The 2001 followup to \\"No. 4\\" would come in the form of \\"Shangri-LA DEE DA,\\" the band's most inconsistent effort to date. Even so, the five or six GREAT tracks on SLDD trounce even the best \\"No. 4\\" has to offer.
0307454541|1.0|There's really not much more to say about this book.  Reads like an episode of Law and Order or worse.  Don't know what the hype is all about. The writing may have lost something in the translation but it's bad.  My book club picked it so I finished it.  Otherwise I wouldn't have.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|This is a beautiful movie, but I don't think it's one of Miyazaki's best.  I think it's great that Miyazaki sometimes makes movies for younger kids (Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service) and some movies that are for adult fans (Princess Mononoke).  This movie is definitely written for the younger audience.  I'm giving this probably a higher rating that I would have just because I think it's well made, great animation, great music, pretty good voice acting.  But I really don't like the story line.  For one it just doesn't hold together very well, at first I think it's a story about a boy who's father is not a home very often and he's dealing with an over-worked and over-stressed mom and finds a magical friend in the form of a fish.  Then it starts to morph into a little-mermaid type of story where the little fish-girl's father is a crazy lunatic of a \\"former human\\" and has a sea goddess as a mother.  And it ends rather abruptly with the two declaring undying love (or else the little girl will die)... don't forget that the two lovers are only 5 years old or so.  I know some Asian cultures still accept arranged marriages between children (they wait until they are older to get married, it's just decided when they're little) but still, I thought that was kind of a rare deal these days.  Ok, aside from the creepiness of kids declaring undying love, there's just too many stories going on here and it gets a bit confusing, a bit overwhelming and seems disjointed.        All that said, I still think you should watch it.  Just rent it before you decide to buy it.
1415926697|5.0|Elizabeth suffered a massive wave of depression after a painful divorce.  She took a year-long trip afterwards.  This book is her memoir of that trip.  In her words it turned out to be a \\"mega, jumbo, international, best-seller.\\"  I agree with popular opinion.  I loved it.  I primarily read romance novels.  So for romance readers like me, I believe you will like this.  It's inspirational, uplifting, surprising, delighting, enjoyable, and yes has a happy ending.  Her choice of words delights me.  There is plenty written by other reviewers, so I don't need to go into more.  But I want to encourage readers to get the audio version instead of reading the book.  The author is the narrator, and she has an enjoyable speaking voice.  I felt like I was sitting in a cafe, having a cup of coffee with Elizabeth as she talked to me of her thoughts and travels.  And, hearing her speak Italian phrases and mimicking the speech of Indian and Balinese people adds something important that I think you would miss if just reading the book.<br /><br />The movie is coming out in August 2010 starring Julia Roberts.  I'm eager to see it primarily to see all the locations Elizabeth visited.  I hope the movie is true to the book by showing the exact places.<br /><br />Genre: memoirs, nonfiction healing travel spirituality romance.
0061914177|5.0|I've been a fan of Gary V for a few years now.  The enthusiasm & passion he shares with his followers is contagious. If you have a project you've been thinking about, but need more motivation, I recommend this book.  If you feel \\"stuck\\" in your current job and want to get out of the rat race, for the long term, read this book.  If you are interested in what all the Twitter / Facebook / blogging / social media stuff is, read this book.  Bottom line, read the book!! It's worth the time for sure!  I've passed it along to many of my friends who also have found it inspirational and motivating.

0711986746|2.0|I bought this book with the expectation that I would get a sense of what Freedie was as a person, and to degree this book does comply, unfortunately it is my opinion that the book comes up short.<br />Reasons<br /><br />a) Structure<br /> I did not like the way the book was structured, it moves across time & space at times seemingly at random, one moment the Author is speaking about events that transpired in 1983 and then he jumps to 1987 and stays there for a significant amount of time when he then decides to jump to another year, leaving a lot of opportunity for the reader to get confused.<br /><br />b) Redundant information<br />One chapter deals with a lot of information  that unless your are a die hard Freedie Mercury fan, the data is of questionable value to me, it almost feels like the Author was just providing filling material for the book.<br />For example Freedie's interior decoration preferences or his auction habits, do we really need to know how  many bathrooms his house had and which one he preferred to use on a daily basis?<br /><br />c) Censorship<br /> Its not that I wanted a gossip type of book, (the back of the book does say it \\"tells all\\")<br />but I get the sense that Peter, was being very careful not to offend anyone in the book, and while this proves that he's a good natured person, it leaves the reader with an incomplete & unbalanced view of Freedie and his entourage of friends.<br />One thing I did not get is that people that according to tv interviews & other books were very significant in Freedie's life get mentioned only lightly in the book and therefore do not convey the true importance of the person, for example Freedie's last 6 year lover Jim Hutton and does not even state that Jim most probably contracted aids from Freedie.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /> The book does have insider knowledge of what happened on a daily basis in Freedie's home, but the way the book is organized leaves much to be desired, much of problem with the book probably does not lie with the author Peter but with the publisher that did not assign a good editor.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?<br />I guess if you are really interested in knowing stuff about Freedie this book will help somewhat, its a real shame & detriment to both the reader and Mr Freestone that it was not prepared better.r that did not assign a good editor.    Would I recommend this book?  I guess if you are really interested in knowing stuff about Freedie this book will help somewhat, its a real shame & detriment to both the reader and Mr Freestone that it was not prepared better.
B0034PJWJ8|5.0|I saw this in the theaters wwwaaayyy back in '79.  I actually got the double lp a while before the movie came out.  This is hands down, without a doubt, my favorite movie/musical/documentary of all time.  I've bought The Kids Are Alright on (ready for this??) album, cassette tape, vhs, dvd, and now on Blue Ray...I just couldn't resist.  If you are a fan of The Who, this is a must have....if you're not, you'd still find it enjoyable.  I can't say enough good about this, it's my favorite!  J.
030726999X|5.0|I came to this novel with great trepidation.  I'd loved the first two novels in the series and was understandably saddened by the premature end due to the author's untimely death.  Aside from that, I was worried that the novel would end with some terrible cliff hanger as the previous one had.  For what it's worth, I'm happy to report that if this series had to end now, I'm completely satisfied with how the story of Lisbeth Salander, Mikeal Blomkvist, et al wraps up.<br /><br />As mentioned above, The Girl Who Played with Fire ends on a cliff hanger.  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest picks up exactly where it ends off.  I'd liked the second novel in the series much more than the first because it dealt far more extensively with the eponymous character.  That is also the strength of Hornet's Nest.  I just can't get enough of Lisbeth Salander.  She is endlessly strange, fascinating, endearing, and resourceful.<br /><br />This final novel strikes the best balance of the three between Lisbeth's story and Mikeal's story, which essentially converge at this point.  But other characters get their fair share of narrative time and a subplot involving Erica Berger particularly captured my interest.  Every storyline allowed Larsson to show off new facets of his established characters.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating things about the plot of this book (which obviously I'm being incredibly vague about) was that in another novel, the good guys and the bad guys could have easily switched places.  There are no cookie-cutter heroes and villains in Larsson's world.  Sure, there are people to root for, but there's a lot of moral ambiguity involved.  All of which makes for complex and smart story-telling.  And Larsson's plotting is as strong as it ever was.  This novel is his best yet.<br /><br />At nearly 600-pages, I plowed through the book at breakneck speed, my interest never flagging.  It is sadly clear to me that Larsson had further stories to tell about his girl.  Not every loose thread is tied up, but the important bases are covered.  The novel's end was as satisfying as anything you could ask for.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Stieg., but the important bases are covered.  The novel's end was as satisfying as anything you could ask for.      Rest in peace, Stieg.

B000HIVOI2|1.0|When a company like Lionsgate produces a high definition movie that has more artifacts than an Egyptian temple, is grainy with poor color, and then decides to fix it with a new release, I find it reprehensible. I can't speak for the new STARGATE release, but this one is completely unacceptable in quality. I'd like this movie in a beautiful new cut, but why reward Lionsgate for producing an awful release and then \\"fixing\\" it for about $20 more? Lionsgate ought to offer replacements for this version. This version is grainy, almost as if taken from the DVD version and digitally enhanced. For shame!
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Just happened to be in a used music store in Doylestown, PA and this was playing over the PA.  It seemed quirky at first, but after a bit it completely grew on my wife and I.    We haven't taken it out of the CD player since.  We just love the low-key and dream-like quality of the music, and just how unique it is.    In this day and age, with all of my favorite performers retired/disbanded/dead, it is quite a pleasant surprise to come across this group's music.  I highly recommend it.

B0037W68F4|3.0|It became pretty obvious over the past couple of years that MGMT loathed the massive amounts of success their debut Oracular Spectacular, particularly its singles, had lavished on the band. Grammy nominations, endless radio play, numerous \\"artist-to-watch\\" lists; MGMT was everywhere and anywhere due largely to their ability to make quirky, sarcastic indie pop with a psychedelic sheen and produce some damn catchy singles along the way. The backlash that has already come with their sophomore effort, then, should surprise no one. Congratulations is almost bullheaded in its resolve to be something Oracular Spectacular was not - namely, lacking any kind of easily identifiable hit single. In doing so MGMT has no doubt followed whatever artistic vision they had for themselves, but their stubborn refusal to make anything that stands out makes Congratulations a decidedly run-of-the-mill rock record.<br /><br />Congratulations seems more like a response to the fame and popularity Oracular Spectacular brought them than anything in the band DNA itself, and it's this kind of knee-jerk reaction that makes the album immediately forgettable. Opener \\"It's Working\\" sets the tone for the majority of the record, neon-colored guitar and bubbly rhythm work complementing Andrew VanWyngarden's trippy vocals and an appropriately poppy melody. There's hints of surf rock, hazy electronica, and bits of noise rock throughout, but for the most part Congratulations stays firmly in this psychedelic pop gear that dominated much of Oracular Spectacular's second half. That's not to say the songs are bad or unoriginal; \\"Someone's Missing\\" sideshow carnival vibe is awesome in a creepy sort of way, and \\"I Found A Whistle's\\" druggy vibe is hard to resist. But it seems that too much of Congratulations is mired in the same psychedelic morass, shooting itself in the foot with bad namedrops (\\"Brian Eno\\") or worse instrumental meandering (\\"Lady Dada's Nightmare\\") more often than it distinguishes itself.<br /><br />It's frustrating that the best song on here is diminished by the band's overt attempt to sabotage it. That would be the twelve-minute long \\"Siberian Breaks,\\" a twelve-minute genre-bender that flits from folk to classic rock to psychedelic opera with ease but with a length that serves absolutely no purpose except to (presumably) intimidate its listeners.  There's little to no thematic link between the separate parts that make up the whole, making for a disjointed if enjoyable titan of a song that nevertheless leaves one wondering why they just didn't break it up into more manageable pieces. It's Congratulations' biggest shame that the most diverse group of recordings on the record only takes up one track in the listing, leaving room for plenty more by-the-numbers psych-rock that pale in comparison.<br /><br />Perhaps the most telling moment of my listening experience was when the title track faded away and iTunes kept going into \\"Time to Pretend.\\" I was immediately absorbed, much more so by than anything that came before, and there lies the overwhelming problem with Congratulations. No one wants MGMT to keep re-making Oracular Spectacular or a hit single like \\"Time to Pretend,\\" but with Congratulations they essentially did the former but forgot to include the latter. Oracular Spectacular was never an amazing album, and without those timeless singles, it's nothing much at all. MGMT have (purposely?) lost that instant magic that they effortlessly whipped up with those debut singles, and in trying to re-establish themselves as artists that don't need the commercial mainstream to survive, they've created a record that lacks any defining characteristics to call its own.rating that the best song on here is diminished by the band's overt attempt to sabotage it.

B002VECM6S|1.0|I am so glad I borrowed this from a friend. I would have been extremely upset if I had paid money to watch this. It was a great story, but the movie was to long. I agree with another review that it could have easily been a lifetime movie. The main story was about Sandra Bullock. She had to many parts in it and took away from the meaning of the story. At 1 1/2hr into it I thought I would go crazy knowing I still had 30min left. Once again I like the story of the family taking Mike in and helping him but that wasn't the main focus of the movie. I felt it was about showing the life of Sandra Bullock and her going to the wrong side of town, marching out on the football field, etc. Too much BULLock!
B001AGXEA6|5.0|This is an all-around great movie from the 90's.  If you like comedy/horror, this is for you.  Alec Baldwin is great, and Michael Keaton is AWESOME as Beetlejuice.  Classic movie especially in Blu-Ray.
0545123267|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater is an author who is known for being fun and eccentric and this passion of hers comes out in her writing.  When I picked up Shiver and read the book jacket, I was expecting a typical paranormal/fantasy young adult read.  What I was not expecting to find was a love story to rival the likes of Bella and Edward (for the Twilight fans), or Elizabeth Bennett and Mr.Darcy (for the Austen fans like myself.)  Grace and Sam have now been cemented in time as having a love story that is swoon worthy.  Their relationship will make you jealous and envious, frustrated and worried, but above all else, readers will find themselves caught up in hoping against all hope that these two will get the happy ending everyone knows they deserve.    Stiefvater gives us not one narrator but two in Grace and Sam, and I have to tell you this may be one of my favorite things about the book.  More often than not, we only see a story unfold from one character's persepective but Shiver leaves nothing out.  We get alternating points of view, feelings from both characters, and because of this you will only find yourself loving these characters and their story all the more.  Grace is a sweet and innocent girl who is a truly kind person that has had only herself to rely on despite having two parents under the same roof, but that's until Sam enters her life.  And Sam, well Sam is that boy that every girl hopes to eventually find because to him, making Grace smile is his main task every day...that and of course fighting like hell to stay with her.  What's not to love about these two?  If you read Shiver and find something lacking let me know, because after reading it myself, to me, these two are the epitomy of perfection.    This is one of those reviews where I don't want to get into the plot too much because every tiny detail Stiefvater weaves has its own significance and deserves to be discovered in her way through the pages by each reader.  I will say I did get my paranormal/fantasy fix with this read but not in the normal ways that most novels in these genres provide.  There are spins on details like what controls the werewolves' shifts, and how the transformation may not last forever.  An expiration date is laid on these characters and their time together and as a reader I was constantly thinking about the unfairness of it all.  Yet somehow these two maintained their own version of hope and kept mulling through it.  They didn't want a pity party; they were just moving forward with their lives and taking nothing for granted, most especially not each other.  It was a lesson learner for me.    This is yet another novel that I've had on my TBR list for way too long and I wish I had gotten to it sooner, but there is a silver lining in my procrastination...Linger, the sequel to Shiver comes out soon.  If I had to wait much longer I'm not sure I would be what you could call a \\"happy camper\\".  I've heard from so many readers and fellow bloggers that this is a novel that has made it into their top \\"10\\" lists of all time favorite books they've read.  They continuously piqued my curiosity and after reading the novel for myself I now understand.  There's just something different about Shiver.  It has that \\"it\\" factor that not many novels do.  It's that extra something that makes a novel not just good, but great!  Go out and get this book if you haven't read it yet, you won't regret it.  I can't wait for Linger to hit the store shelves.
0061914177|5.0|First off this book is top notch and when you read it you feel the passion behind Gary.  I had the opportunity to meet him at a seminar on Biz development and it was the first time a presenter spoke with every single person that stuck around.  Most take off ASAP and get back to real life but Gary was true to his word and his passion and that is helping other people.  Just like that day which turned into night as he spoke with others, the book speaks to you and gives you an easy step by step process of how to begin to work on your passion.  Gary is worth his weight in gold and so is the book.  Read it and then go out and Crush It yourself.  I am on my way, thanks to Gary!  Go Do it!

B000H6SXMY|1.0|That was a period at the end of the title so that's that. Just  terrible. Whenever this is on, I hear the canned laughter and I wonder  why. They don't tell jokes or do anything funny. All they do is say  something stupid that makes them look like an idiot and then the canned  laughter comes on. Wow. I'm not 5 years old anymore. I'm not mentally  disabled and it takes more than that to make me laugh. Not one of the  actors or actresses is likable. I will always purposely try to avoid  any show or movie that any of them will ever be in. They might be good  at acting but only at acting like they are retards. I have had enough.  You have the iq of a 5 year old if you think this show is funny. Pure  Garbage.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|We love Dexter - the storyline, the acting, the humor...  It is certainly not your typical run-of-the-mill series.  Didn't discover the program until Season 4, but then went back and purchased seasons 1-2-3.  Had no problems with the DVD's from Seasons 1 and 2, but the set from Season 3 was defective (the first DVD would not run).  It took 2 weeks to get a replacement Disc 1 from the seller.  Were it not for that problem, Season 3 set would have received 5 stars.
9056912445|5.0|As a USCF \\"A\\" player who peaked at expert, the importance of expertise in the ending is something about which I am well aware. This book has 100 endings that are among the more common ones that will be encountered in tournament play, rather than an encyclopedic effort of limited value to the practical player.    In round two of the U.S. Amateur East tournament in February, I played with king and knight against king and rook against a 2150-plus player. The result was a draw (the only game in which I have ever been able to declare a draw as a result of the 50 move rule). Simply put, this draw was entirely the result of the knowledge I gained of this ending from this superb book.    I am now in the process of re-reading the book. Clearly there are other important endgames and endgame textbooks. \\"Schematic thinking\\", which is covered in Shereshevsky's book is not covered here. Some of the endings will already be familiar to experts, A-players, and B-players. However, overall, to find such a well written book that immediately produces results as a consequence of giving the reader an understanding of these endings is extraordinary.

B00316DDWW|5.0|After finding out about this band via Pandora, I'd downloaded their first full album \\"Themata\\", and soon it was the only thing I was listening to. A few months later, I find out that their second album \\"Sound Awake\\" was released in Australia, and I immediately had it imported. In a word, this album is astounding. Fantastically heavy at times, the sounds are dirtier and messier than on \\"Themata\\". Ian Kenny's vocals positively soar on this album, from delicate falsettos to full power, he never reduces himself to a typical metal screamer. The songs are sometimes complex, but never lose their intense drive. The musicianship is top-caliber without calling attention to itself. This is the rare band whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I had the good fortune to see this band at SXSW, and a couple other times on their current US tour, and their live shows are simply amazing. One of my favorite things: the fact that they chose to close \\"Sound Awake\\" with a great drum jam from Steve Judd, one of the best drummers out there. I can't recommend this album enough.
B00243FQFA|5.0|I was concerned after season 4.  The writers obviously had difficulty coming up with a way to work around Rachel's pregnancy, but did well, better than most sit-coms for sure.  I thought I liked Dr Beckett, but I like Dr Keller better.  I thought Ronan helped make the show, but having him as a side-kick was better.  Robert Picardo makes any show shine, but I was never a fan of Samantha Carter to beging with.  That being said, the 5th season relied on old-fashioned science fiction.  Have a few main characters and send them someplace new every episode.  If you liked Star Trek, you'll like this season.  If you want a long story, watch a soap opera.  Like any series, there needs to be a little suspense and drawn out every now and then, but not a whole season's worth.  Other than Vegas, which is nothing more than CSI, season five is absolutely outstanding.  They even got me to like a Wraith-Todd.
0062502182|5.0|This book is a great little novel that can inspire people of all ages and beliefs.  It has some humor and some tragedy.  It may not be the best written novel of all time, but it is well worth the time it takes to read it.  I keep a copy around to read when I need some reminders about life.  As with all books, approach with an open mind and you will enjoy it, even if you don't love it like I did!
B00027JYLC|5.0|When this was first released, the newspapers and even radio film critics, churches and the movie houses, even the studio, were agahst, critical, disgusted, etc etc. AND there was nothing to freak-out about, unless that they got a dose of their own prejudice against these special folks, as well as not LIKING to admit that is why they were disturbed (offense being the best defense read: defensivness). FREAKS actually showcases the performers as the humane and socially/morally upright ones, and shows the \\"normal\\" performers as the cruel and evil ones - so superior in their \\"normality\\", that they look on the freaks with contempt. Theaters either edited down due to the new \\"code\\" coming out in Hollywood or just plain banned - and I think it's because it took the civil veneer off just how badly many people can behave towards those they feel are inferior to them. Claiming it was because it \\"exploited\\" the feaks was just a red herring to hide behind. I feel the film is a pure little treasure of early Hollywood and have been VERY happy to own it, and I cannot even count the number of times I've watched it already!
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|I think it is the right time finally for Jack to get a chance at a good nights sleep. Until the last couple of weeks, this wasn't a very good season(way too chatty, not enough stuff blowing up) but the show has picked up the slack of late and hopefully will finish strong. Will Tony resurface?
0061733199|4.0|This was a very good read, but not the kind of book you read and your an expert at surviving in the Artic Shelf. Excellent information, the only two areas I could see improvement on were, shelter building, and edibles. With only a few ideas on temporary shelters, I felt it kind of lacking as that situation could very well be in order if survival is threatened. Also the author's suggestion of eat and \\"pray\\" method leaves a little to be desired, but it seems to have worked for him, and he has very high credentials. Overall though, one of the most comprehensive survival books out there, but don't leave it all to one book. Supplement this guide, with shelter building, and a book solely on wilderness edibles to make yourself the most rounded survival instrument you can be. Also in regards to my opening sentence, you WILL NOT be an expert on any survival book, unless you try the techniques outlined, before you need them!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" is extremely comfortable with the specific way it wants to tell Dickens' story, and by definition, is different from any other telling of the classic tale.  The risks it takes with the story pay off hugely, and the  warmth, humor and overall skill that went into this production is obvious.<br /><br />Starring Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, it features only a very small number of visible human actors.  They are not missed, as the vast majority of characters are played by Muppets.  There is Kermit The Frog as Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit,(in this version Bob's wife gets a proper name)and Gonzo as Charles Dickens himself, among many other Muppet characters.  The inclusion of a Dickens surrogate is particularly nice, as it functions like an anchor to the original story while also providing an entertaining main narrator for this variation of it.<br /><br />Also featuring a number of beautiful songs and a great script, \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" is unique and timeless.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Anyone who eats anything, should see this movie. If you think you do not have an impact in this world, watch this film and then \\"vote\\" by sending a message to food manufacturers next time you are in the supermarket. This should make America rethink what we put in our mouths!
B002WY65W4|4.0|I am not a fan of horror movies, and especially zombie movies like \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". However, I love movies that make fun of horror movies and zombie movies. Zombieland, like Shaun of the Dead, does this extremely well. Woody Harrelson's character is a parody of a butt-kicking action hero, while Jesse Eisenberg's character is like a young Woody Allen trying to survive a plague of zombies while battling social ineptness, various neuroses, paranoia, and oh yes, a crippling phobia of clowns. This \\"odd couple\\" work very well together to produce a very solid film.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Why on Earth some \\"genius\\" at Disney ever made the decision to stop making traditional hand-drawn films is beyond comprehension to me.  Nevertheless, I am glad that it has finally made a comeback.  After all, what somebody apparently failed to realize is that it's not the MEDIUM that make a movie but the important things like STORY, CHARACTERS, and SOUND.  That seems like a fairly obvious statement but I guess it's one that needs to be made.  Speaking of story and character, this movie has plenty of both.  Despite what may be alluded to, Tiana is not really a princess at all but a girl from New Orleans.  The prince is turned in to a frog by a voodoo man and is looking for a princess to kiss to make him human again (which is what should have happened according to a classic fairy tale).  Tiana is mistaken for such a princess and once she kisses the frog prince she is turned in to one herself.  This leads to a journey of self discovery for both the \\"princess\\" and the frog.  The characters are all hilarious but my favorite is Louis the jazz trumpet-playing alligator which brings me to the music in this film.  It's done by Randy Newman and it accompanies the New Orleans setting perfectly.  It is so vibrant and full of life that you'll be singing all day long.  The visuals are so breathtaking that it seems like it breaks new ground.  Watching it in HD on Blu-Ray really makes you appreciate it for all it's worth.  The Princess and the Frog sits nicely along other hand-drawn favorites and it definately doesn't fall short of what many picture as classic Disney animation.
0061914177|5.0|Social networking and media were a far off and rather despised universe in my everyday life. I didn't see the point and I could only view websites like facebook/twitter as a waste of time and energy. Having found myself rowing upstream in my career recently, a friend recommended Gary's book. I read it in one sitting and it was a Saul on his way to Tarsus conversion. The way I look at the world, my business and myself has been fundamentally altered and i could not be more excited. I had debated blogging for a while but didn't clearly see the point, Gary showed me, not only the point, but the most effective way to do it. A month in and I have made over fifteen serious connections with folks in my profession that would not have occurred without the blog and Gary's social networking advice.  Gary purposely leaves out some details, all those details are a simple google search away. Instead what he gives you is an infusion of PASSION, ENERGY and, really, a kick in the butt to change your life.  If you have a business idea, a lingering passion you want to pursue...check it out...PLEASE!!!  Take a word of advice from this reluctant but now fervent convert. Gary shows you a great new road, it's you're job to take the first steps and chart your own personal journey.
1584282584|5.0|On my 6 year journey from enthusiastic amateur to part time pro I have decorated a large part of my bookshelf space with all manner of photography books. While some inspire with amazing images (see The Moment it Clicks by Joe McNally) it is always those books which take you through the details of each shot with specifics about settings and the reasons behind their choices that I come back to most often. This book is possibly the best example I have come across of the latter and ranks up there with Monte Zucker's Portrait Photography Handbook in my indispensable book list.<br /><br />What I found to be a revelation in this book is the in depth discussion about TTL. Since the beginning of my journey with DSLRs when a few professional photographers steered me away from TTL exposure and encouraged me to use the manual flash settings I have never really cared about or played with TTL. I would even go a step further and say that I felt that TTL was for new camera owners who simply didn't know any better. Based on what I have learnt and hours of practicing these techniques I am now shooting about 80% of my on-camera flash shots using TTL. Moreover I am getting consistently better photographs and spending much less time in Photoshop correcting exposure.<br /><br />In terms of the level of the book, an understanding of exposure is required and assumed by the author and in all practical terms, photographers without a hot-shoe flash (i.e. those shooting with the popup) should spend their money on the flash before buying this book. There is very little discussion about external flash techniques, so those shooting predominantly with external strobes or in a studio environment should look elsewhere. As I mention above, the book is also unapologetic about focusing on using TTL to get optimal exposure so photographers who refuse to use automated flash metering should (open their minds and) look elsewhere.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about any photography book is that it hadan immediate and noticeable effect on my end product. I read the book on a plane heading to a family gathering and tested some of the concepts throughout the trip. The final prints exceeded my expectations and I continue to see the positive influence of this book in all of the on-camera flash work that I do.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. This movie was the first movie that I ever went out to buy and the first and only movie I went out to buy again cause it came out in blue-ray. that's how awesome it is. animation and graphics are absolutely beautiful. everything's just so well done. even if you're not a final fantasy fan you can still enjoy this movie.
B0009MAO46|5.0|this is a great movie that keeps everyone entertained thru the whole show. It is funny and teaches children about sharing and taking care of things. i am so glad they brought this out in a movie to teach kids.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is decent. controls are very clear and sharp. I recommend it. The only problem I have with it is that the product don't last. After about half a year it malfunctioned so I had to use warranty to get a new one and even the new one is starting to show defects.
B00335EQ0E|4.0|Ah, for once its good to be old...yes ...as i can remember the movie and the specials when they came out. And now we have not only this movie filled with<br />laughter and songs but extras as well. My personal best from the bunch must be<br />The Fred Waring Show...it features the girl that voice Alice with the cast and<br />crew of the The Fred Waring Show doing some musical arrangements linked to Alice.<br />What beautifull music they made...and truly captured the Alice feeling....<br />I was walking the downtown and i went i a video store and was taken by surprise<br />by the songs that was filling my head....It was the Disney movie of Alice in<br />Wonderland......and that folks started the process of getting Alice in Wonderland.
B000002KCI|5.0|During one of his many interviews about the [[ASIN:B001O12TO4 Neil Young Archives, Vol. 1: 1963-1972]] project (LONG before Volume 1 saw the light of day), Neil discussed the content of the archives, how it was assembled into projects that could be released as stand-alone albums long after he's gone. At one point of the conversation, Crazy Horse bassist Billy Talbot joked that all he cared about was \\"getting the Zuma masters.\\" It's easy to see why. On a song-by song basis, there are tracks in Young's larger catalog that are stronger than some of the ones found here. But a better album? In terms of prowess and maturity, up to this point in time, no. This is his single most powerful statement since the endless jamming of [[ASIN:B001VZY4MI Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]. Neil and Crazy Horse would do it one more time...with [[ASIN:B000002LMK Ragged Glory]]...forming a perfect trilogy, with the individual pieces decades apart.    The stand-out tracks are \\"Don't Cry No Tears,\\" \\"Lookin' For A Love\\" (with Neil delivering the falsetto \\"When she starts to see the darker side of me\\" over angelic \\"Ahhhhhhs\\" in the fade-out), \\"Barstool Blues\\" (\\"and I saw you in my nightmares, but I'll see you in my dreams, and I might live a thousand years before I know what that means\\") and...of course...\\"Cortez The Killer,\\" a fine addition to the \\"long songs\\" that Young fans have come to know and love. Sure, he tweaked it with that odd reggae-ish \\"He come dancin' across the water, mon\\" bit on [[ASIN:B000002KDI Live Rust]], but messing with the heads of his audience has been a life-long addiction for Young. It's all part of the territory.    In Neil's world, nothing lasts forever, least of all the masks he's chosen to wear on each of his albums. In the final analysis, though, that's what makes the special albums so special. This is one of them. Get it.
0061914177|4.0|The following are excerpts from my review posted on January 12, 2010 at [...] and here's the actual link: [...]    Great book, I really enjoyed it. Gary Vee is not just entertaining, as it turns out, nor is he simply driven. He's an inspiring, thoughtful businessman and marketing strategist who looks well into the future to anticipate trends; all the while, keeping his eye on the ball. So what is Gary's #1 strategy? CARE.    Here's the deal: Gary can explain in his book, exactly what he means by \\"caring,\\" and the thing is that it really isn't any different from the approach taken by good old-fashioned great brands, all over the world. It is one thing to say that you care, but it is an altogether different thing to actually live it. What are some of the great caring brands of our times? How about Nordstrom? How about McDonalds? How about Starbucks? He says it boils down to the quality of the communication, and he's right. \\"It's about listening.\\" You listen, you give it your all, and you make adjustments when you need to.

0545123267|5.0|There was nothing about Shiver that I found lacking. It's the perfect balance of romance, mystery, and drama. When you begin to think the romance is missing, Maggie lights up the book with a great romantic bit. This goes for all aspects: not dramatic enough? She throws in a twist. GREAT. Definately recommend this to young adult readers: tasteful, imaginative, and addicting!    I read it in one sitting!
0451228731|1.0|Spoiler- Ending sucks, so I don't mind mentioning a bit of what happens to characters in end (without naming characters names).  I a very angry that I wasted my time with this book. I was reading it voraciously to begin as it was fast based, and I found the premise very interesting. Then I realized I was almost done with the book when he killed off the 1st of the original heroes, and it still didn't look like the good guys might win. Then the book took a nose dive and just got horrible. If you like getting pissed off because the bad guy wins and all the good guys are killed off or may as well be, this is the book for you. The ending ruined it for me. I will never read the next book because the author completely obliterated a great story with a p.o.s. ending. Maybe the author doesn't understand the difference between good and evil. He points out the problems with our society and capitalism and uses that as his excuse for evil to win. Very disappointing in terms of the philosophy he promotes and very disappointing in the (maybe more importantly for a fiction piece?) way he ends the narrative. The climax is supposed to be a turning point, but I just felt like it was more of the same but worse. 5 stars to 1 star as another writer said.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I'm not a vegan, nor a vegetarian.  I enjoy the occasional burger, and steak so rare that it moos when I take a bite.  While the documentary hasn't totally changed my perspective on eating meat, it has definitely changed my perspective on where that meat comes from.<br /><br />And not only beef, but poulty, and any of the hundreds of foods we consume made from corn.  It goes without saying that the documentary makers have an obvious bias against many major food corporations, but some evidence speaks for itself.<br /><br />I first watched Food, Inc through Netflix, but bought several copies from Amazon to send to my relatives.  I love them, and want them to stick around, so I'd like them to at least have a better understanding of what they put into their bodies.  They don't have to change what they eat; just rethink where they might get it from.<br /><br />This is an eye-opening documentary that offers a very interesting perspective on major food corporations.  A little biased at times, but there's no way to spin some of the startling facts that you're presented with.
B0010HOZS0|2.0|A better title for this one might be \\"What in the World is Nicole Kidman Doing Here?\\"  The film begins - in extremely poor taste - using actual news footage (or a very real duplication) of the 2003 Columbia space shuttle tragedy.  Incredibly, the footage is used in a fictional context, like showing scenes from 9/11 in a James Bond film.  Such was the intellectual maturity of the makers of this film, which belongs (if it belongs anywhere) in a late-night trash marathon on the Sci-Fi channel.  This is a paint-by-numbers geek show, with all the standard gross-outs, implausible scenes, bad dialogue and horror movie rip-offs.  Even the most ardent Fangoria nerd would be hard-pressed to find anything new here.  Two stars for Ms. Kidman's earnest performance.  The rest is rubbish.

0375842209|5.0|I don't often review Amazon books, particularly those that already have more than 800...but I was so touched by this book I felt I needed to.  I picked this up on a Thursday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon because I couldn't put it down.  I got sucked immediately into the world and the characters, and I wept at the ending. This is a tour de force.
0061914177|4.0|This book is not an in-depth analysis of blogging, WordPress, Facebook, Twitter, etc. etc. It's a guide for people who want to take their passion to the next level and get busy with it. It's the perfect starting point if you have an idea or a passion and just need a little focus and somebody to point you in the right direction. It's a quick read and is really all you need to help you get up, show up, and get busy.
B0033AX26I|5.0|I think San Patricio is a great work of art and an important entry in the ongoing culture wars in US society.  I won't repeat the excellent historical perspective supplied by Naoise O'hannain in her (his?) review.<br /><br />What I would add is that there are very powerful forces in this society that really want to bury this type of history.  Comments such as \\"more US bashing\\" and others are reflections of that.  But why are these folks afraid of their own history?  That's a question to ponder.  Could it be that if the modern-day conquering armies of the empire were aware that there is a history of rebellion against being sent off to conquer their brothers and sisters, it might put ideas into their heads?<br /><br />My main memory of boot camp (some 40 years ago) was that its main feature was the incessant drilling into our heads of \\"obey\\"!  Not \\"think\\", not \\"question\\", but OBEY.  There is an intertwining of that need for blind obedience in the military and the promotion of religious fundamentalism that is so widespread in the US now.  So there's some irony in the religious element of the San Patricios, no?  Life isn't simple, much as some would like us to believe.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This video should be required viewing in all schools. It tells the sad truth of what, our crippled by greed, food industry has become. Most Americans are in the dark about how unhealthy their food supply has become. A lot don't want to know.  But all that blindly eat this molested food are going to eventually pay the price with their health. It's too bad, because most will suffer long painful deaths while dying from bizarre, unnecessary diseases.     Most view food like Homer Simpson. If it tastes good, it goes here (pointing to mouth).

1419553429|2.0|I am not blasting this book - I am giving you a rating based on the expectation that the description of this book sets. It does not live up and you are bound to be disappointed. However, it is actually a valuable book but you need to be aware of what you are buying and probably how to use it best when you buy it:    As a pure guidebook - 1 star  As a question collection - 3.5 stars    What You Will Find Inside:  28 Critical reasoning questions  31 Reading comprehension questions  110 Sentence correction questions  107 Problem solving questions (only 7 of which cover combinations and probability)  37 Data Sufficiency questions    ***** CONS *****    * No review of math principles or grammar rules. This book assumes that you have gone through the Kaplan's main GMAT book. If you need help with basics look into getting the Math or Verbal Workbooks before getting this one.  * Illogical structure. Instead of the typical approach of providing a rule and then questions to practice that rule on, this book just lists questions in each of the sections. All of the valuable information and tips are scattered around the explanations section. The book assumes you will read/review explanations for every question. In defense, the main point is often emphasized, so they are not too hard to find.  * Question difficulty. Fewer than 50 people per year score 800 on the GMAT, and most of the lucky guys get past 700. To appeal to a broad audience, Kaplan designed this book at a 650/700-level  * Math section is fairly easy and lacks meaningful practice in advanced subjects such as probability, combinations, or coordinate geometry, statistics. If these are your weak areas, you should look elsewhere      ***** PROS *****    * The book does what it was supposed to do - provide advanced selection of questions, giving the necessary practice with relevant questions. Though Kaplan's questions are not one-for-one official GMAT questions, I found them fairly close overall. I also liked the explanations - they were very detailed  * Good verbal section with valuable RC practice; huge selection of SC's  * Good quality publishing and paper; good layout  * Price - I thought it was worth every penny :)      Bottom Line: This is not a guidebook or a book to start with - if you need to get better in a certain question type, then get it but don't expect it to be sufficient to give you the background often needed to score 700+.

0061914177|5.0|I picked graphic art at an early age and stuck with it.  My love, trains.  I love to stand beside one hundred cars of freight rolling down the track.  Not everyday do the grapes bring wine in my life, but when dealing in joy, you know their is always wine for someday aging in the heart's oaken barrel.    That is why I work out of joy.  Just out of school, I was asked by my favorite railroad, the Burlington Northern, if I would design a paint scheme for their newest order of locomotives.  My drawings, each done by hand, showed something that a computer could not.  A warmth in style that flowed from my love.  I knew I had to read \\"Crush It!\\" as it was about me.  It was about how love flows through my tasks.  The only competition in the world is yourself.  How much better can you do it than you did last time?  Make \\"Crush It!\\" your book, too, and you will find yourself excelling.    Thank you for your time,    Andy Fletcher

B000XVSU9O|5.0|I was given this book when my father died suddenly.  It sat on my night stand for two years before I picked it up.  I had been so filled with grieve and felt scared  (as an adult) not knowing where my father's spirit had gone after he died. The book gave me peace and possible answers ....I felt he was OK and it took my fear of death away.  I have purchased a total of fourteen or more copies of this book in the last seventeen years.  I give them to family and friends when they have loved ones pass away.  I always keep a copy for myself.  I tell people to read the book when they feel they are ready.
B002M9FYO4|5.0|I have several of the Audio Fidelity releases and have been pleased with the sound quality so far, though the packaging leaves a little to be desired.  For such a premium price, it would be nice to have the lift-lock jewel cases, but enough nit-picking.      I was hesitant to purchase this Audio Fidelity release due to the comments from the previous reviewers.  After finding this item in a retail outlet a few months ago, I bit the bullet and bought the CD.  It was a low-numbered release (#0673) so I do not believe anything was corrected that the previous reviewer discusses.  I have read some negative reviews of Audio Fidelity's \\"Heartbeat City\\" and that compression was used on \\"The Pretenders\\" self-titled release (but it still sounds great to my ears, but I have nothing else to compare it to).       After playing the CD in my POS car stereo, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality.  The detail was impressive.  I cranked the volume and my ears did not hurt.  I love that.      I did not hear any false start during \\"They Call Me the Breeze\\".  I wonder if the reviewer who mentioned this false start may have ripped the CD to mp3 and then encountered the 'false start'?      If your intention is to buy these Audio Fidelity releases and then rip them to mp3 for playback and never listen to the CD on a home stereo (or car for that matter), then you should probably save your money and buy the standard CD release.  Compressing these discs to mp3 format defeats the purpose of having a CD mastered with no compression (and paying the premium price).      This CD really shines on a player that supports the HDCD format.  This is how you should hear the CD.  I would imagine that this release rivals the MFSL release that now goes for no less than $55 used.  Go buy yourself a cheap OPPO universal player, break out your favorite whiskey, and listen to some of the best music that Southern Rock has to offer.
0425166805|5.0|Erich von Daniken has obviously done his homework. This was one of many books he wrote (this one being a sort of encyclopedia rather than an in-depth discussion). A very enjoyable read.    Honestly the arguments of modern day scientists to disclaim von Daniken is to point to phony articles skeptics wrote about him in which they fakely quote him by saying he fabricated his evidence. Also Skeptic Magazine in 2004 claimed that von Daniken had plagerized his information from an earlier book that was written called Le Matin des Magiciens, written 5 years prior to von Danikens Chariots of the Gods. This is a foolish statement due to the fact that witnesses around him say that he has indeed been writing on this story since he was student, and instantly as the book came out he could spend hours upon hours talking about why his information was right, whereas if he had plagiarized he would only know what was in the text of Le Matin des Magiciens, which clearly wasnt the case. Another gripe is why would only Skeptic Magazine of all organizations be finding this out nearing 50 years after Chariots of the Gods was written?    Having written my own books and more to come (look under John R. McAdam in a year when they are finished publishing) from April 12, 2010, I can say that I am not blind and I have some minute things I disagree about with von Danikens theories (because I try to think for myself rather than let others tell me how to think), though to use that argument to discourage one from reading the book is utter lunacy as the minute details in perhaps only 1 of every 100 cases von Daniken talks about in all of his books is..well..minute. My personal ideas which differ from von Daniken's still draw the absolute 100% same conclusion as von Daniken draws at the end of Chariots of the Gods. What is that conclusion? Pick up this book and find out ;).    If you want a fun way to see the world and a \\"beginners guide\\" for modern day alien astronaut theories, start with this book.5 out of 5 stars.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|First of all, this movie is beautifully done, the characters are engaging, the visuals wonderful and the music catchy.    Now to rebut the two primary criticisms I see:    1. Too scary for kids: May be intense for some but my five year old daughter took it in stride. In my opinion, it is no scarier than the huntsman hovering over Snow White with an axe. Disney fairy tales always have intense scenes/characters.    2. Disney's first black princess spends an hour as a frog. I think people are being way to picky on this and are missing the point. My white five year old loves this movie, watches it at least 4 times a week and wants to be like Tiana. She does not see Tiana as black, white or green----she sees a lovable character she can look up to and isn't that the true fulfillment of Dr. King's dream?
B00006CXSS|5.0|So much has been written about \\"Band of Brothers\\" that I am hesitant to comment about an undertaking this magnificent. Following E (\\"Easy\\") Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne throughout their World War Two trials, the production, script, direction, and acting combine to make this possibly the most compelling production about war and the camaraderie of men who have served in combat together that has ever been filmed, and for that we own Stephen Ambrose, Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg genuine gratitude. Ambrose wrote the book on which the series is based, and oddly, while good, I didn't find the book in the same league as the series, or Dick Winters' autobiography (which I highly recommend.) The genius here was in the synthesis of excellent scripts, general historical accuracy, a perfect cast, first-rate special effects, and a keen directorial eye, which resulted in a sum far greater than its parts.<br /><br />While I was floored by the entire cast, I have to single out a few for special mention. First and foremost, Damian Lewis as Maj. Dick Winters gave one of the greatest performances in cinema history. Period. There is no way that his nuanced performance could have been improved upon by anyone.  Ron Livingston also gave the performance of a lifetime as Winters' best friend, Capt. Lewis Nixon. We can also thank Livingston for his good humored behind-the-scenes video diaries which are included as extras in the set. Donnie Wahlberg likewise gave a great performance as Carwood Lipton, the most mature of the soldiers, while Neal McDonough perfected the role of the sensitive Lt. Buck Compton, a brave man troubled by the horrors he had endured. Finally, Matthew Settle appears as Capt. Ronald Speirs, an enigmatic warrior, whose legend is (perhaps) bigger than the man himself, and who has some mighty big shoes to fill when Winters departs for a headquarters position. The cast is huge, but suffice it to say that every single cast member was superior in their role.<br /><br />The DVD set comes with numerous features, including a \\"Making of 'Band of Brothers'\\" feature (which could have been longer in my opinion,) and a superior documentary about the real men of Easy Company, called \\"We Stand Alone Together.\\" Unlike most sets of this size and scope, every single minute is worth watching, re-watching, and truly absorbing. It's amazing what these men did for the world and the cause of freedom, and I am grateful to everyone who participated in this undertaking for helping preserve this important piece of history and American heritage.role.

B00129H7VS|5.0|First off the mini series alone is quite possibly one of the best WWII features you will ever witness, if not one of the best pieces of cinema you will have ever seen. Everything from the acting to cinematography to directing and writing is top notch and pure gold. And what better way to enjoy this masterpiece than with the magnificent beauty that is Blu-Ray. This is quite possibly the best looking feature you can find on Blu-Ray. It brings to life all the beautifully crafted cinematography while still maintaining its classic, grainy feel of the time. And not only does it bring out the image, but the sound as well is superb and must be experienced in full 5.1 bliss. Weather you are a movie buff or just want something to look pretty on Blu-Ray this set will blow you away and make you fall in love with it over and over.
0061537969|5.0|I was aware of this book long before I picked it up.  I'd seen the book in Starbucks (that alone made me suspicious) and the title compelled me to at least read the jacket.  Being Formula One fan is an affliction I picked up from my father, and I've taken to heart his observation that when the rain begins to fall, you find out who the real drivers are.  But my interest waned as soon as I read that the book is told from the perspective of a dog.  \\"Schlock\\" I thought, and quickly put it back on the counter.  Sometime later, I came across the book in the library.  One of many wonderful things about libraries is that one can check out a book risk-free.  If it's awful, simply bring it back.  Nothing lost.  I checked it out, and cracking it open, prepared myself for the worst.  I was wrong.  Very wrong.  This book is brilliant, sad, beautiful, and moving in too many ways to outline here.  While I can't speculate intelligently about the interior life of dogs, I can say that Enzo's character is so perfectly drawn, and so humane, that the suspension of disbelief is effortless.  So many authors get the love of cars and racing wrong.  They see it as about brutal competition, the love of death, or loud, dangerous machinery.  Not Stein.  Stein gets it.  He understands that the beauty of driving fast is to be found in the flow of it, in the delicate and dangerous balance between momentum and friction.  It's controlled exuberance, precision, passion, and joy.  It's many of the best things in life compressed and intensified.  Serious drivers will find here many of the adages that one learns while trying to master the art.  Imagine that there are eggs on the pedals.  The car will go where you look.  Smooth is fast.  The inclusion of those sayings is enough to indicate that Stein has done his homework.  But it's the overall feel of the book that lets you know that he understands and shares the love of driving cars on the edge of control.  If the book were simply a paean to racing, itwould be good.  But it's about more than that.  Neil Peart, in his review of the book, expressed it perfectly: it's \\"an affectionate portrait of a sad and beautiful world.\\"  Above all, it's a moving and humane story, and one that remains with the reader long after the book is put back on the shelf.
B0037W68F4|4.0|MGMT's debut album was difficult for me.  Pretty much every time that I tried to dig into the weirder sides of it, I was pulled back into the catchy dance-hooks of \\"Electric Feel\\" and \\"Kids.\\"  I never really made it past those songs in any significant form.  So to hear Congratulations, the band's newest album is both a gift an a curse.  A gift because, like it or not, there ain't a song on here that's overtly accessible; and a curse because that makes it all the more difficult to get into.  Fortunately, if you're able to give it the time it deserves, you'll find a fairly decent and rewarding album that only gets better with time.<br /><br />MGMT spend most of their time on Congratulations exploring the murky depths of psychedelia and blending it with pop music of both current and past persuasions. \\"It's Working\\" begins resembling old school Of Montreal before colliding head-on with a Beach Boys hook, complete with multi-part harmonies.  Throw in some Surfaris, \\"Wipeout\\" drums and you've got one hell of a tribute to 60s pop/rock!  One thing to take note of here is how often the songs on Congratulations seem to change direction, often ending in a completely different manner than they started and going through multiple alterations in between.<br /><br />This is never more apparent than it is in the 12+ minute, \\"Siberian Breaks.\\" The problem here isn't that the multiple movements in themselves are awful, but rather that they seem to be pieced together for the sake of being difficult.  Of Montreal pulled off the multi-movement thing with Skeletal Lamping, but MGMT's attempt here seems forced.  That's a real disappointment too because there are ideas in \\"Breaks\\" that could have been fleshed out into full (great) songs but are left as mere appetizers.  \\"Song for Dan Treacy\\" handles the idea of cramming a bunch of concepts into one song much more smoothly.<br /><br />My favorite track on Congratulations has to be \\"Flash Delirium,\\" a song that I would imagine would be absolutely amazing live.  Despite the fact that it's got the catchiest, most obvious melody on the album, it's also got a bunch of stuff that I simply wouldn't expect, but love!  Whether it's the random shout-along verse, the jazz flute, or the chaotic finale; there is something here that just does it for me.  Perhaps it's all of the above.  \\"Brian Eno's\\" frantic, organ-heavy, Monster Mash-ish sound is equally as infectious.  If the band were to release a single from this album (apparently that's not the plan), this seems like the safest choice, as it's a fun, upbeat track that probably has the widest appeal.  People still like circus music, right?<br /><br />My apologies to MGMT, but I spent my first few minutes with Congratulations skipping through the songs looking for an obvious first single a la \\"Time to Pretend.\\" Much to the chagrin of, well, everybody I would imagine, that song doesn't exist.  Congratulations is an album about exploration and experimentation, about embracing sounds that are either long-forgotten or entirely new.  The result of such an endeavor is an album that is certainly mixed, but refreshingly deep.  If that album art up there seems a little too weird for you, your time may be better spent elsewhere.  As WTF-inducing as that image is, it's entirely appropriate for an album this bizarre.  But aside from weirdness, Congratulations offers above average lyricism, complex instrumentation, and deep arrangements that beg to be listened to over and over again.  Will I be jamming any of these songs for as long as I've been jamming \\"Electric Feel?\\"  Not even close.  But Congratulations is easily one of 2010's better releases thus far, and should definitely be checked out.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Song for Dan Treacy\\"<br />2. \\"Flash Delirium\\"<br />3. \\"Brian Eno\\"<br />4. \\"Lady Dada's Nightmare\\"<br />5. \\"Congratulations\\"<br /><br />7 out of 10 Starsite the fact that it's got the catchiest, most obvious melody on the album, it's also got a bunch of stuff that I simply wouldn't expect, but love!

B001EIOOWC|4.0|I watched these films one right after the other (\\"Promises\\", first). As they're thematically almost identical, and have the same male lead, it made sense to write a single review covering both. (The \\"Promises\\" section is at the end, if you're in a hurry.)<br /><br />In \\"History\\", I'm not giving away any great secret when I reveal that Tom Stall really is a gangster trying to escape his past and lead a decent life. He's \\"outed\\" when obliged to kill the men robbing his diner, and the TV stories of his heroism come to the attention of those he thought would never be able to locate him. The rest of the film is basically a revenge tale in which Stall is obliged to kill every last one of them, including his brother (an almost-unrecognizable William Hurt, in a performance that sidesteps most of the \\"standard-gangster\\" clich&eacute;s).<br /><br />The problem is that there's not much else to the story. It's little more than a revenge tale that has no moral force, because Stall truly needs to protect himself and his family. There is no drama without choice. (Roger Ebert's argument that had Joey /truly/ become Tom, he would have died in the diner robbery, is absurd. Tom throws hot coffee at one of the robbers, which /any/ desperate person would have done if they were worried about the lives of those around them. Tom is virtually certain that the younger of the robbers /will/ kill one of his employees, even before he hands over the cash register's contents. This renders pointless any ambiguity about \\"who\\" Tom really is -- if you know you're going to die, you'll take any chance.)<br /><br />Despite Cronenberg's averral that he wants the audience to identify with Stall's killings (rather than be revulsed by them), so that we have to consider their morality, the /fact/ is that Stall's need to violently defend himself is at least /legally/ justifiable, and the audience is completely on the side of a genuinely reformed gangster from the start. I greatly enjoyed the vicarious pleasure of seeing him off every one of his enemies, and most viewers are likely to cheer rather than turn away.<br /><br />Another problem with \\"History\\" is the way Stall's wife is so quick to reject him when she learns the truth. We see, in an early sex scene, how much they genuinely care for each other, but even Tom's post-revelation rape (yes), which she thoroughly enjoys, is not enough to bring her to her senses. If Cronenberg is making the trite observation that we never /really/ know the people we live with, it would have been more effective if Stall's wife, though understandably frightened and anguished, were also at least /somewhat/ ambivalent about the situation. How can a woman who says \\"You're the best man I've ever known\\" be so quick to think the man she's spent almost 20 years with is a monster in disguise? But, no, she firmly rejects him until the final scene (which Cronenberg directs with beautiful restraint). I would have kicked her out and found a more-loyal mate.<br /><br />There's no restraint in Cronenberg's continuing love for explicit gore. In both films people are brutally killed, and Cronenberg doesn't hesitate to show us -- in close-up -- such things as a slit throat pumping blood, or the nearly blown-off jaw of a still-living person. (If you think this is bad, take a look at the deleted scenes from \\"The Fly\\", some of which would likely have gotten that film an X rating.)<br /><br />If \\"A History of Violence\\" is about character, rather than plot (as Roger Ebert suggests it is), you coulda fooled /me/. Its ending is largely determined by its beginning, and that is not the substance of character-driven stories. There is one genuinely clever and witty scene in which Stall's son, Jack, verbally humiliates the school bully. But Jack is later obliged to beat up the guy, and Stall is worried about being sued by the kid's parents (!!!).<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" is about Russian gangsters in London. It, too, is a revenge story, but one of more complexity and subtlety. It has an audience-pleasing twist ending that is at least plausible, if not wholly likely.<br /><br />Morton Vigoro -- I mean, Viggo Mortensen -- is a Russian criminal (Nikolai) who's the \\"driver\\" for a Russian gangster (Semyon -- Armand Mueller-Stahl) who runs a fine restaurant. Nikolai's tattoos reveal his criminal life; without these tattoos, he wouldn't be trusted, or for that matter, even be considered a criminal at all. When Semyon has had enough of his feckless son Kirill (Vincent Cassell), he agrees to have the kid offed, with Nikolai moving into Kirill's position -- which is what Nikolai has wanted all along. More I cannot say -- other than to be patient with the first few minutes of the film, which at first seem incomprehensible.<br /><br />Unlike \\"History\\", \\"Promises\\" /is/ about character, and we're not sure how we're supposed to take Nikolai -- he seems to be a villain with just the faintest trace of a conscience. Kirill is particularly interesting, as his homophobia clearly covers his own sexual confusion. He's obviously in love with Nikolai. Nikolai's feelings about Kirill are not so clear. Is he just using Kirill -- or is he also attracted to him?<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" is a legitimate drama, and if you can get past Cronenberg's horrifying neck slashings, you'll probably enjoy it.t is at least plausible, if not wholly likely.

B0037W68F4|5.0|Based on some of the initial critic and fan reviews, I might be alone (or at least one of the very few) who will be saying this, but I truly believe MGMT's Congratulations is one of the best albums to come out in the last decade. They were able to take everything that made them big from their debut and completely ignore them...and for that, I think they have comprised one of the most amazing collection of weird and twisted songs that I've heard in a while. What people need to remember is that aside from the few radio hits that came from Oracular Spectacular, Congratulations actually ISN'T too much of a departure from a lot of the other great songs on that album. Unfortunately, there are many \\"top 40 hits\\" type of people who took a liking to MGMT simply because of those songs, perhaps without giving much notice to the rest of the album. I'm afraid because of this part of their fan base, Congratulations will never receive the credit I feel it is due. I do however understand that it was all a conscious choice by MGMT, so they might expect a bit of a change in dynamic with the people who listen to their music from now on. I'm sure there will be many people who will indeed decide not to listen to them anymore, but as for me, I just became a fan for life with Congratulations. For anyone who is on the fence about how they feel about the record, give it a few spins. It definitely took me a few tries to fully absorb and understand this album, but once I did it was quite an eye-opening experience. Hopefully like myself, you can find it to be just as catchy and much more adventurous than anything they have done.

These are people who've chosen to stop using harmful chemicals in their hair and enjoy the beauty naturally endowed in them.  Virtually everyone is shocked to realize just what is going on in the food industry.  If you are what you eat then you surely should know what you're eating and ergo what you're becoming.  There is far too much sickness in our society today and I suspect much of it is due to the fact we are not getting proper nutrition but instead too many modified substances.

B003102JDM|4.0|SOMEBODY TO LOVE, the Jefferson Airplane's (J.A.) soaring 60's anthem expressing the transcendence  of existential anxiety \\"When the truth is found to be lies, you  know the joy within you dies.  Don't you want somebody to love...\\" opens,  closes, and plays a central part in this dark comedic look at Jewish life in the 60's.  Having experienced J.A. five times live in the  60's, I was more than hopeful when I heard its uplifting, aerodynmaic rhythms  again for the first time in years.  Once, at the Filmore in San Francisco, J.A.'s Grace Slick  projected her laser like eyes to me during \\"SOMEBODY..\\" for what seemed like an eternity (more like 30 seconds). For me, the best thing about  this movie is that it led me to recapture my love of J.A. (this time on Youtube).    The first time I watched A Serious Man, I and my parents were quite  disappointed.  We agreed it was disjointed (lots of dream sequences) and lacked character development.  I not  only fell asleep, I hardly laughed.  But in honor of the J.A., I gave it another  viewing the next day when I was more in a movie mood.  The 1st scene that pulled me in  this time around was the tedium of Hebrew School being disrupted by the Rabbi pulling the plug on the transistor radio  the 12 year old boy was listening to and the class erupting with laughter as SOMEBODY TO LOVE completely upset  the routine quiet.   What teenage boy of that era would not have preferred  this song to the repetition of learning a difficult language?    The aforementioned boy's father is a math professor so out of touch with  his marriage that he is shocked when she tells him she wants out and is  having an emotional \\"affair\\" with a \\"friend\\" of theirs.  \\"When the truth is found to be lies...\\":  his \\"solutions\\": move to a specific motel (as requested by his wife and her love interest) where he comes off so passive, you wonder  how she married him in the first place.  For example, his rival places  his hand on him in a superior manner across thetable, and he does not pull away.  He later gets stoned on marijuana and seriously flirts with/dreams of a neighbor's wife and then  seeks the counsel of 3 rabbis--the most wise of whom is \\"too busy thinking\\" to see him!  This elder \\"sage\\" has reached a stage in his life that he only greets the young men shortly  after their Bar Mitvah ceremony.  And when he meets the aforementioned 12 year old after  his Bar Mitvah, he not only returns the confiscated transitor radio, but  paraphrases SOMEBODY TO LOVE in a question \\"When the truth is found to be lies, and all the hope within you dies....then what?\\"  The Bar Mitvah boy does not know how to answer but is clearly touched that  the Rabbi took the time and trouble  not only to learn what song disrupted Hebrew class, but  but named 4 of the J.A.'s members--a hip and caring sage indeed.  So I disagree with  those who found this portrays Jews in a negative manner.   I would say more in a sometimes  painfully honest and amusing light.      The ending will leave you hanging.  Do not watch this movie  unless you are in the mood for paying close attention to details.  If  you are, it may remind you of some wisdom you have heard before such as taking a 2nd look at things if your world falls apart....

B002XMOK6S|5.0|A mystical tale about following recurrent dreams! This is the first book I have read of Paulo Coelho. After reading this book, I would say that it comes close to being a modern classic. The reason why it does not merit the status of a classic is because it falls short of a punch in the climax. The writing loses the intensity of the build up that has been promised at the beginning.The character sketches of Santiago, the Andalusian shepherd boy, the King, the Tangiers crystal seller, the Englishman, Fatima and the alchemist have been etched well. Coelho writes with wisdom and experience behind him. He has understood the pulse of the Spanish, the Arabs and the English quite well. While reading through this book, we also get enlightened about the art of alchemy.<br />It is a tender and gentle story. I will give you few glimpses: \\"People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it's better to be with the sheep, who don't say anything. And better still to be alone with one's books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them. But when you're talking to people, they say some things that are so strange that you don't know how to continue the conversation.\\" In one of the passages, Fatima tells Santiago, \\"The desert takes our men from us, and they don't always return..we know that, and we are used to it. Those who don't return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything ... they become the Soul of the World.\\" This book teaches us how we all belong to the soul of the world which is in turn the soul of the Creator. It also teaches us that once we get on to the quest of our dreams, it is the soul of the universe that beckons us to succeed and inspires the environment to help us should we be true to our hearts.
1439163855|5.0|My Sister's Keeper, a realistic fiction novel brilliantly written by Jodi Picoult, expressed the definition heartbreaking and hopeful all at once.  Bestseller, My Sister's Keeper, a story about a girl, Kate, plagued with leukemia at a young age and her family's struggle to keep her alive. Also about Anna's fight to make a verdict that could end her sister's life, and destroy her family this book really takes you by surprise.  The mother's solution, to conceive a perfect bone marrow match for her daughter, may be the worst decision she's has ever made.  That plan, followed through by the family set Anna, the marrow match, up for a life of torture without consent.  By age thirteen Anna, physically exhausted from the surgeries and donations, wants out.  Jodi Picoult vividly expresses one tragic story through each main character's point of view. By alternating point of views, it allows you to understand each character's perspective on specific events in the novel.  For example, Anna, the protagonist, introduces you to the story in place of her outlook, and then it switches to Campbell, a main character, for him to express his viewpoint on how the story started.  Picoult changes from Jesse's standpoint, to Brian's, to Sara's, to Anna's, to Campbell's, Julia's and to Kate's often throughout the telling of the book.  Sara and Brian are proud parents of Anna, Jesse, and Kate.  This family, very interesting, dramatic, and attention-grabbing, drew me into the book.   Campbell, Anna's lawyer, started off being not one of my favorite characters, however started to grow on me.  Julia, Anna's guardian ad litem and a now serious woman trying to win the case of her client, used to be a crazy young spirit who didn't care what any one thought. I particularly loved her.  Even though this book punched my heart because of the sadness, I cherished it.  My favorite part of the book, how it alternated points of views helped me understand the book with ease.  I highly recommend this novel to any person who enjoys a sad, however intriguing story, which touches your heart.

The long wait has been amply rewarded with the two-disc set \\"Leave Your Sleep.\\" The album details are covered enough in the product description and other reviews, so I will not go into the impressive list of contributing musicians and amazing process Merchant used in making the album.    The aspect of \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" that impresses me most is the high quality of Merchant's voice. She has never sounded this good, which is saying something. Sure, the selection of poetry is awesome and the music itself is brilliant, but it is Natalie's vocals that tie everything together and make this album such a masterpiece. She delivers perfect vocals throughout the two discs. Given the wide variety of styles among the 26 songs, one would think there might be a few so-so songs. Not so. Natalie can take virtually any genre and make it her own. I am enjoying everything about \\"Leave Your Sleep.\\" It will take me more time to fully digest everything about the album, but so far after listening through the discs several times I am amazed at how my already lofty expectations have been exceeded. I only hope that Natalie doesn't leave us hanging so long between this album and her next.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Excellent in every way.  I know some of the critics of the play in London have not given it great reviews, but I have seen and listened to the Phantom over the past 15 years and this couldn't have been a better sequel to it.  The songs are haunting and magnificent.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If I ever thought about making some serious changes in my food choices, this film answered all my questions. This is truly a must-see for everyone. One of the things we know very little about is where our food comes from. It is an important thing to include in our knowledge. This film will do that.
0142001104|2.0|I had to read this book for a course I took.  I thought it was interesting although I didn't really feel like it spoke strongly to me.  I also saw Ben deliver his presentation at a corporate retreat - entertaining for sure.    However, I recently witnessed Mr. Zander and his wife's behavior towards another passenger in the first class cabin of an airline.  They were rude, self centered and generally uninspiring.  The book and the message have now lost all meaning to me.
1439190275|5.0|I've always been in search of a PLAN not a fad diet that would assist me in making a lifestyle change. After reading this book and starting on the phases, I have truly found that this is something that works for me. It is simple and doesn't have much guess work to it. Many people believe Atkins to be a high-fat diet, however, this book and the resources supporting this state otherwise. I'm glad I got the facts and did not listen to people who were going off assumptions. Overall this was a great read and has started me on my way to an actual lifestyle change that I can maintain for the rest of my life!
0061922315|5.0|I loved this novel, and I cannot wait to discuss it at my bookclub!  I felt like I was living the life of each of the three main characters: all women, and each with their own story.  It is a story as much about being a mother as being a daughter, and about cultural identity and finding oneself: certainly any reader will find much with which to connect and much to contemplate.  The cultural landscape of India adds a richness to the novel, enlightening the reader to the highs and lows of a country steeped in tradition.  It is beautifully written and captivates me immediately, holding my attention and imagination throughout.
B003E8AF5U|5.0|Redefining what we think of Alternative Rock & Pop in the last 2000s, MGMT could be considered revolutionary. So how do you follow up an album where you turned the melody of \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" (Kids) into a synth New Wave epic? Ladies & Gentlemen, it's time to walk on the Psychedelic side.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Flash Delirium<br />Siberian Breaks<br />Bian Eno<br /><br />Dropping the 80s influences, MGMT takes things back to the 60s, ate 60s, when the ingestion various paraphernalia led to the creation of Psychedelic, a trippy form of music that was layered with a complex series of instruments, melodies, and lyrics that made little to no sense. This describes Congratulations perfectly. Don't worry, there still are some electronic elements to the music, but even they're used in a trippy fashion.<br /><br />In fact, your enjoyment of this album will rest solely on how well you can handle the utter insanity and experimentation found here. I personally found it way out there the first listen or two, but I eventually came around to it and eventually came around to the conclusion that it's brilliant, and the song \\"Flash Delirium\\" is an utter masterpiece.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Congratulations\\" feels like falling down the rabbit hole into an Alice in Wonderland Psychedelic Retro Hipster Musical. Your experience with this album will vary depending on your reception to MGMT's new sound & the experimentation, but I personally found it brilliant. Dude, it has a song about Brian Eno.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|This series is supposedly based on the books by E.B. Sledge and Robert Leckie but evidently Hanks and Spielberg did not think that the sacrifices of the men in the Pacific were important enough \\"to sell\\" without adding lots of gratuitous sex, nudity, and language that was not typical of men of that era - see Andy Rooney's My War who claims that men in WWII did not use the \\"F-word.\\"   That is not to say that some troops did not visit prostitutes or have affairs. However, the series cheapens the lives of men of deep faith, who are the main characters in the series. If you read Leckie and Sledge, you will find that the producers of the film fabricated parts of their lives merely to sell the series and make money for themselves.  Furthermore, such graphic sex does nothing to advance the story. It also robs young people of the opportunity to see an important part of U.S. History because this series, at best, should have an \\"R\\" rating and a strong warning to parents and teachers.  Spend your money and time on something that is more accurate historically and shows the lives and sacrifices of American troops in a more accurate light.
B001TH28EO|5.0|If you want to have your music and listen to it, too, then this one is far, far superior to Brilliant's complete set.  Every CD, every piece, every performance is excellent.    Look, there is only one Op 40 Horn Trio, there is only one Op 80 Academic Festival Overture, etc....  So why own a performance that is not world-class when you can have one that is world-class?    I am not being a snob - I am saying that some performances are more enjoyable than others, some are done better than others.  That why you are reading these reviews.    Another point of view: I got the Brilliant Beethoven, but added critical sets from excellent performers: Arrau Sonatas, Guarneri String Quartets and van Karajan Symphonies.  That is to say, the stuff that really matters needs to be right.    Brahms has got to be the most clunker-free major composer - it ALL really matters. Nothing here needs to be improved upon - there are no weak points in the performances, just like there are no weak points in the compositions.
B003405MF6|4.0|I must admit, before listening to this album I'd never heard the work of Jeff Beck. But now that I have, I ask \\"Where have you been all my life?\\" It takes a talent to pull off an instrumental album and you usually have to be a legend to do it. After listening to this album, I'd say Beck is a legend.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Corpus Christi Carol<br />Hammerhead<br />Over The Rainbow<br /><br />As usually is the case with these albums, it usually has its best moments when the artists are allowed to come out full-force, free of any other distractions, such as other instruments, or singers. Oh, singers will kill you every time, which makes the Joss Stone track an absolute throwaway, and subpar by her standards, not to mention it has a severe lack of Beck in it. Lilac Wine isn't much better and neither is There's No Other Me.<br /><br />The album is also true to its name. There is commotion to be found, and when there is, it's usually an enjoyable interlude into the art of Beck in all-out free-form glory. But there's a lot more Emotion on the album, in the form of slower jams & jazzy tunes. If you're a fan of smooth jazz, or relaxing music, then you should be entranced by these tracks. However, in my opinion at least, they pale in comparison to the Commotion. They do sustain their grace throughout, but they hardly strike me like the Commotion does, and frankly, they come off a bit generic, especially in the Jazzy sections. There is an exception however in the lovely cover of \\"Over the Rainbow.\\"<br /><br />Overall, while I would have liked a little bit more Commotion instead of Emotion and a big orchestra, it's still a pleasant and graceful record through and through. Beck is truly an amazing guitarist, and the more he can show that without distractions, the better he is/will be. Fans should enjoy, new listeners should be pleased. If anything, get the album for its magnificent cover art.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I followed this band pretty closely from 1985-1995 and it was only recently that I re-discovered their music.  This 2004 release from Marillion is just wonderful.  Indeed, I like this album enough that I regard it as one of their finest efforts.<br /><br />The overall sound of this album is, like many of the albums released with vocalist Steve Hogarth, very melancholy and atmospheric.  However, the stadium rock influences are gone, and every track is solid.  In addition to the adult contemporary (soft) rock style, the group seems interested in the current rock scene and the influences of Coldplay and Radiohead are pretty heavy.  What sets Marillion apart from these groups however, is a greater emphasis on longer compositions.  Vocals, however, are equally prominent.<br /><br />Although present on the first and last tracks, there really is not too much of the neo-progressive influence on Marbles; especially in contrast with albums such as Misplaced Childhood (1985) and Afraid of Sunlight (1995).  Regardless, I like the direction this group is heading in.  The songs are soft and very easy to listen to and I find both the lyrics and the music to be engaging.  Hands down, my favorites on the album include the lengthy opening and closing tracks.  The guys have grown as musicians and the playing is tasteful throughout - Steve Rothery is noteworthy in this respect (although the David Gilmour [Pink Floyd] influences poke through here and there).<br /><br />This album has spectacular sound quality (thanks to Dave Meegan) and the liner notes feature the lyrics and the recording credits along with some arty images.  Total playing time of this single CD version of Marbles is somewhere around 64 minutes.  I have not accessed the additional material included on the disc.  Although there is a 2CD version of Marbles floating around out there, I was more than satisfied with this single CD version.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the finest Marillion albums I have heard in a long time.  My hope is that the group will continue to quietly put albums of high quality out; I certainly enjoy their music very much.  Recommended along with their neo-progressive efforts with Hogarth at the helm including Seasons End (1989), Brave (1994), Afraid of Sunlight (1995), and the transitional (albeit very good) This Strange Engine (1997).ng time.

0307346617|3.0|Reading his zombie survival guide was great the deadpan approach was hilarious. That book was fun until the recorded attacks in history, which were all the same. In World War Z, the stories all seemed to really blend. One thing I really did not enjoy is the amount of people interviewed in the book. Some passages honestly felt like filler and gave nothing pertinent to the story. I wish he chose 4-6 characters and the whole book book was their interviews. At times he leaves you hanging and if he returns to the character, you dont even realize it because of all the abrupt character changes. Awesome concept, poorly written.

1401323820|3.0|I love ABC's Castle.  I love the characters and the plots of the stories, I even loved how they incorporated Heat Wave into the show.  However even from everything I love about Castle, I was slightly disappointed in the book.  I found the very beginning of it boring and very slow to get through.  I think they used the word \\"heat\\" way to many times.  The plot sometimes to me became unbelievable and I just lost interest.  Of course I wouldn't start reading another book until I finished this one, and I managed to push my way though it, but it took me over 2 months to finish and I can normally finish books in a day or two.    I will say on the positive note that once I got 1/2 to 3/4 through the book, I was able to quickly finish the rest (not sure if it was just trying to read fast to get it done with or if it was really that good towards the end).  Even though the first attempt to me was a bust, I will try to read the next one when it comes out.  I like to at least give them a second attempt to get it right.    Hope this helps someone out there!
B0035V35PI|4.0|Ninja Assassin is certainly one of the most stylish Ninja movies ever made. The cinematography and soundtrack are awesome, capturing the shadowy, quick moving stereotype of these black clad martial arts experts with their swords, chains, flying stars, etc. And the blood and gore is almost off the scale as you see people sliced and diced. But behind all these extravagant action scenes is also a pretty good story, interesting script, and unexpectedly good acting, The story explains through flashbacks how these adult Ninja Assassins came to be - throw away street kids subsequently enslaved in an orphanage that serves as the martial arts training ground for Ninja clans. We meet the patriarch of this so called family, Ozunu (Sho Kosugi), who demands absolute loyalty, or death. Raizo (Rain), rebels, survives an escape, and becomes the outcast Ninja Ninja Assassin - interesting twist on the movie title. Throw in Naomie Harris as a targeted Europol agent who knows too much about the Ninja Assassin Clan, and then teams up with Raizo to bring the Clan down, the movie then shifts into a high action bloodbath. I was fascinated with the actor Rain - what a perfectly honed body and what great martial arts choreography. The other actor that really impressed me was Sho Kosugi, the chief villain, who was really scarily sinister. The brutality scenes of the kids training at the orphanage was eye-opening, and leaves more of an impression that the stylistic, almost cartoonish, adult action. If you're into Ninja type movies, then Ninja Assassin is definitely one I'd recommend viewing.
0061537969|5.0|I flat out loved this book.  Perhaps it is a little gimmicky, but the author completely suspended my disbelief and I entered a world I'd like to live in...one in which dogs can believe that humans might have evolved from them as opposed to apes. Worth the time and money.
B003405MF6|5.0|\\"Emotion and Commotion\\" is Jeff Beck's much-anticipated new release. Clocking in at just about 40 minutes, there is no wasted space on the disc. I will not go through track by track, as the other reviewers have done a nice job summarizing each song. Basically on this album, Beck leaves behind the high-powered techno and electronica flavors of his previous albums \\"Jeff,\\" \\"You Had It Coming\\" and \\"Who Else\\" and goes for a more laid-back, worldly groove of classic rock fusion with classical undertones. Besides his amazing tone, these songs are wonderful. The covers are arranged well and tastefully done. Anyone who can transition from the beautiful \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\" to Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" and back to Jeff Buckley's \\"Lilac Wine\\" and make it cohesive within the album is doing something right. The Beck originals, \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"Serene\\" are also well-written.    I recently started listening to Jeff Beck a couple years ago. I admit that I am a newcomer to his music. As a guitar player, I cannot even begin to comprehend Beck's tone and virtuoso skills. I am blown away by what he is able to achieve on his instrument. This album is highly recommended to 1)Any Jeff Beck fan (obviously), 2)Anyone who plays the guitar and wants to understand what is capable on the instrument, 3)Anyone who wants to explore creative and exciting new music, produced by one of the most criminally under-rated musicians of our time. Hope this helps!

B000GBEWHA|5.0|\\"Grease\\" was released durung the summer of 1978 and became an immediate hit both for its story of young love and its amazing soundtrack. Like \\"Gone With The Wind\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", and \\"The Sound of Music\\", most regard this film as being one of the greatest films Hollywood has ever produced. The movie solidified John Travolta as a movie star and made Olivia Newton-John world famous. The movie's plot is a simple one in that it tells the tale of two people who meet, fall in love despite life's obstacles, and live happily ever after. The story sounds cheesy, but the movie is timeless, as a whole new generation of viewers have come to love it thanks to the DVD and blueray market. The soundtrack is equally good with songs like \\"You're The One That I Want\\", \\"Sandy\\", \\"Grease\\", and \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\". Marie Osmond was offered the part of Sandy, but turned it down when she realized Sandy was going to become a so-called \\"bad girl\\", in which she was depicted as a smoker with large hair wearing a tight black outfit. I am sure Marie regrets not taking the role! The DVD comes with trailers, commentary, interviews, and more.
0749953357|5.0|I found this book an easy to read account of what it takes to step out and get your message out there and go beyond the status quo. Seth Godin does not claim that this is an easy path to take. Linchpins are people who have decided to create something without a map, to take the initiative and to give one´s gift to the world in an unconditional way.    I really resonated with the chapter on the power of resistance and how easy it is to get stopped in one´s tracks because of Resistance and excuses. We create our own stories in order to remain in the safety zone. I believe that most of us want to express our gifts however we are programmed at a deep level to say to ourselves \\"I cant do that\\", or \\"what will they think\\" or \\"its not my time\\" etc etc.     Great book and thanks for writing it.

B002WYH5N2|5.0|Wider screen compared to the original DVD version which is cropped. Visual detail is also better as one would expect from a blu-ray version.  As for comparison to the 1995 version, I love both, but there are people who claim the 1995 version is vastly superior. It seems most often that they love Colin Firth in his wet shirt which has nothing to do with the novel, but it seems to incite some feminine imaginations. The BBC version is not without its faults, but the leads are very strong and the series/running time is longer and thus captures more of the Austen wit. The 2005 version's cast is uniformly stronger and being a movie, the production values are thus naturally stronger (better visually and musically). Judged on its own as a movie, the 2005 version is visually striking and its music score is worth a purchase on it's own merits.  You can't go wrong with either version really.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|We have many farmers in the family. I had them watch this DVD as soon as I received it...all they could say at first was,\\"WOW!\\" & \\"AMAZING!\\". This DVD taught even them a few things. They also found themselves ashamed of being a part of buying the seeds from the companies destroying this countries food supply & are now \\"fixing\\" things. Some are even talking about switching to organic farming. Several of us have switched our eating to the organic vegan form & have actually had amazing things happening with our health...medication dosages going down & in some cases, going away all together.

0240810961|5.0|Most of us know only of Walt Disney but never heard of the other Walt, Walter Stanchfield.  He worked on every full length animated Disney release until 1986, \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\".  Spent a great deal of his time training many of the greatest animators of our time .  Among his students are Don Bluth, Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles), and John Lassater of Pixar.  This book is a testament to the greatness of the man.  No doubt, a man of genius.<br /><br />This book is a direct peek into some of the secrets inside the Disney animation. A more serious approach,  which comprises of lectures and tutorial text. Very informative and full of tips for those who want to get themselves get involved more and more in depth into the world of animation. Most importantly, it teaches you how to breath life and put heart into your creation.

B00008RWRH|5.0|I have heard bits and pieces of quite a few versions of the London Symphonies. While they are all good, most seem to have flaws, although this is admittedly subjective.<br /><br />Take Scherchen for example - while the fast movements are vivid and bursting with energy, the slower movements are dismally slow. When you find yourself skipping past some movements because they sound dull, that can't be a good sign.<br />Even the much acclaimed Fischer, while producing a smooth and beautiful sound and quite quick on the faster movements, lacks the energetic feel so essential to Haydn.<br />Szell, who is usually intense and precise in his interpretations, seems not to have recorded the entire set of 12.<br /><br />Then we come to Jochum, and I can find nothing wrong here. He is brisk but unhurried. The slower movements are beautifully done, rather than boringly slow. There is energy, passion, and commitment to the spirit of the music and the sheer beauty of Haydn's work, all without losing precision and going off into excessive interpretive realms. Very good work, thoroughly enjoyable, and true to the spirit of what one imagines Haydn had in mind when he wrote these symphonies.

B002RKSXJG|5.0|It's some years since I've read a Victorian novel, and I admit that it took a few chapters for me to re-adapt to the Victorian style of writing and of speaking. Often a little long winded, in typical Victorian fashion, making me re-read a sentence three or four times to determine exactly what the writer is saying, The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins soon became not only enjoyable but a book I could barely put down!<br /><br />I am very glad to say that I stuck with it. Initially I thought this would be a romance so I braced myself for that alone (I am not a big fan of romantic fiction). I admit that I skipped a couple of pages when I was a few chapters in (I can only handle so much drippy fawning over a beloved) but only had to do that once.<br /><br />The Woman in White is certainly not just a romance, but also a great mystery novel and filled with some very intriguing characters. Marian Halcombe is, of course, my favorite - a strong woman who belittles herself and women far too much, but also Pesca and later the Count - even at the end, I couldn't bring myself to hate Fosco! Indeed the only characters that I disliked were those I believe I was supposed to dislike... the idiotic Fairlie, the smarmy Baronet and a pity-hate relationship with Mrs Catherack. Throughout the whole book, we are made aware that something bad happens... and unlike a traditional mystery where we read to find out whodunnit, in this case we wait with baited breath to ask not only whodunnit, but also what did they do? Cleverly written and highly recommended!<br /><br />The Woman In White is in the public domain so I picked up this free ebook instead of one of the paid versions, and I was perfectly happy with the Kindle formatting.
0439023491|5.0|The first third of the book starts off slow, changing the setting for the plot from the arena of Book 1 back to District 12 for Book 2.  But in the second and last third of the book, the action picks up, and the main character moves away from the slow progression that allowed her to contemplate the future to a setting where she can only act and react.  By the end of this book, I was completely engrossed and am eagerly awaiting the third book in the series (due out August 24th!)

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Oh my gosh.  This is a must see for everybody!  Other than reading \\"Slaughterhouse\\", this is the biggest eye opener as to our foods and meats in this country.  What is involved in feeding the world, the lack of nutrition is the junk that we get after it is all processed, no wonder we're sick with various diseases.  And, the farmers!  What a miserable job our country is doing for them, making slaves out of them, forcing them into huge debt.  This film alone has made me go to an organic farm to sign up for foods, trips to the local Farmer's Market as well.  No more regular grocery stores for my family.  America deserves so much better, and the joke of the USDA.  They should be ashamed.  Terribly ashamed.
B00005JKNC|4.0|THE MAJESTIC is a unique film in the Jim Carrey canon, for the renowned overactor and frenetic clown plays every second of this one STRAIGHT. His character is sober, thoughtful, a refreshing change for viewers and clear evidence that Mr. Carrey is far more than the rubber-faced buffoon he's been typecast into.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />In a story set in 1951, Peter Appleton (Carrey) is a screenwriter whose second film has been shelved by the studio when he's wrongly accused of being a Communist sympathizer. After a drunken wallow in self-pity and a long drive to nowhere in particular, Peter's late model convertible slides off a slick wooden bridge and into the river. He barely escapes drowning but sustains a concussion that we soon learn has caused severe amnesia. Peter is found on shore in a semi-conscious state by Stan Keller (Whitmore) and is brought into the small town of Lawson.<br /><br />Sheriff Coleman (Briscoe) mistakes the bewildered accident survivor for Lucas Trimble, a WWII hero who's been missing since shortly after D-Day, when he heroically saved 8 men from his platoon. Lucas's dad, Harry Trimble (Landau) is certain his son has returned from the dead. So is the war hero's girlfriend Adele (Stanton), plus just about everyone in town.<br /><br />Try as he may, \\"Lucas\\" can't remember anybody, but he entertains the idea that all these strangers are correct about him. Harry and Lucas refurbish the family business, an Art Deco-era movie palace called The Majestic, and they re-open with Gene Kelly's [[ASIN:B00004RF9F AN AMERICAN IN PARIS]] (1951) as the first feature. Meanwhile, men from Lucas/Peter's past slowly unravel the mystery of the screenwriter's disppearance.<br /><br />When Peter's first film, \\"Sands of the Sahara\\" plays the Majestic, it triggers deep memories in Lucas, who's able to recite dialogue he's supposedly never heard before.

0385504225|3.0|Compared to Dan Brown's previous books, the \\"Lost Symbol\\" was a let down.  I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it: I did, and read it to the end, but it is an \\"airplane/train ride\\" kind of book. Read it, toss it. The characters do not seem real, particularly the \\"bad guy\\".  There is some action but it follows the same pattern as in Brown's previous novels, as if he had used the same template over and over again. It wasn't exactly fun to read either. (To use an expression from the Thai language: it is not \\"sanuk\\"!) There was too much information packed into what should have been a entertaining novel, not a treatise on the Founding Fathers. To me, it was like reading a guidebook to Washington DC, a pamphlet on Noetic Sciences, and my 6 year old's \\"Jack and Annie\\" series all in one. Informative, but not living up to the hype.    On the bright side, the book contains many fascinating facts about our capital's monuments.  If you are interested in such things, this is the book for you.  If it is fun, well researched historical novels that you are after, then I'd recommend Will Smith, William Dietrich or Steve Berry.

B000YHUNFG|4.0|THE MAJESTIC is a unique film in the Jim Carrey canon, for the renowned overactor and frenetic clown plays every second of this one STRAIGHT. His character is sober, thoughtful, a refreshing change for viewers and clear evidence that Mr. Carrey is far more than the rubber-faced buffoon he's been typecast into.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />In a story set in 1951, Peter Appleton (Carrey) is a screenwriter whose second film has been shelved by the studio when he's wrongly accused of being a Communist sympathizer. After a drunken wallow in self-pity and a long drive to nowhere in particular, Peter's late model convertible slides off a slick wooden bridge and into the river. He barely escapes drowning but sustains a concussion that we soon learn has caused severe amnesia. Peter is found on shore in a semi-conscious state by Stan Keller (Whitmore) and is brought into the small town of Lawson.<br /><br />Sheriff Coleman (Briscoe) mistakes the bewildered accident survivor for Lucas Trimble, a WWII hero who's been missing since shortly after D-Day, when he heroically saved 8 men from his platoon. Lucas's dad, Harry Trimble (Landau) is certain his son has returned from the dead. So is the war hero's girlfriend Adele (Stanton), plus just about everyone in town.<br /><br />Try as he may, \\"Lucas\\" can't remember anybody, but he entertains the idea that all these strangers are correct about him. Harry and Lucas refurbish the family business, an Art Deco-era movie palace called The Majestic, and they re-open with Gene Kelly's [[ASIN:B00004RF9F AN AMERICAN IN PARIS]] (1951) as the first feature. Meanwhile, men from Lucas/Peter's past slowly unravel the mystery of the screenwriter's disppearance.<br /><br />When Peter's first film, \\"Sands of the Sahara\\" plays the Majestic, it triggers deep memories in Lucas, who's able to recite dialogue he's supposedly never heard before. When Lucas spots: \\"written by PETER APPLETON\\" on the film's lobby poster, his mental fog clears and he finally remembers who he is.

1567230466|3.0|3.5/5 stars    Fun, well-written, and refreshingly comedic, I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Convenient Marriage'. It was everything I hoped it would be and, while lacking in the deep-thinking department, it more than made up for it in wit and humor.    At the outset of the story we are introduced to the eldest Winwood daughter, Elizabeth - a beauty of of noble birth, yet virtually penniless. At the prodding of her well-intentioned mother, Elizabeth is about to turn her back on her true love, Captain Heron, and marry a complete stranger, the Earl of Rule, solely for his vast wealth. However...    Enter: Horatia (\\"Horry\\") Winwood, Elizabeth's younger rebellious sister. Though rather young and uncouth, as well as stuttering and stubborn, Horry decides to save her sister from a loveless match! After much scheming, and to her elder sister's relief, Horry eventually takes her her position as the Countess of Rule. The Earl accepts the swap, but not without 'enduring' the adventure and hair-brained antics that ensue, involving the Countess herself, Pelham (the Winwood's congenial gambling brother) and his drinking buddy.    'The Convenient Marriage' literally brims with witty dialogue and interesting back-and-forths, with well-drawn characters and a quickly moving, easy-to-follow plot. The ending, albeit predictable, will satisfy any true romantic at heart.    This was my first Heyer experience - I was so charmed by it that I *know* it won't be my last. :)

B002VPE1B6|1.0|This movie just left theaters 2 weeks ago and i find out it's being released on dvd next week??? I know America is suffering an economic turmoil but this is ridiculous and just another reason why there going to be milking this crap-fest of a movie till lets say at least christmas with about 3 or 4 editions of garbage you don't need. And James Cameron allowing this to happen proves his laziness as a director and his unappreciation towards his fans or what he might as well see as dollar signs. Look Cameron ...director's cut or not you have so much clout in Hollywood all you have to do is make one version/one edition and people will accept it especially coming from a world famous director and they would respect you even more for it especially if nobody has money to buy 5 editions of your crap in these harsh economic times. What a sell-out ...hey did we put your kids through college yet??? ..cus guess what mine aren't going and so are most peoples kids. And if i did choose for them to go it wouldn't be from the money that has been ripped off from innocent minds trying to view the latest sci-fi/fantasy movie. I know someone must've said this to George Lucas ...now it's time for Cameron.

Evans (I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS), Jonathan Stark (HOUSE 2: THE SECOND STORY) and Dorothy Fielding (GOLDIE AND THE BEARS) star in the Tom Holland classic; FRIGHT NIGHT. The main story line is remiscent of DISTURBIA except it is a vampire instead of a human that is the killer. A high school student named Charley Brewster claims that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge is a vampire because of the blood shed and screaming happening every night. He does everything until he meets up with the great vampire killer himself; Peter Vincet. Their adventures together are funny and very brave. The movie has average special effects for the 1980s. A lot better of effects than any FRIDAY THE 13TH movie of the early '80s that is for sure. The movie is pretty graphic in some parts of the finale but it is so much fun at the end. That is all I will give you. I know I give short reviews but I only want to say the things I like about a movie or product and some favorite scenes, no major spoilers. See you later. Infinity out of 5 star rating!
1416550550|5.0|Morton's novel is an engrossing and fantastical narrative about women. The product description clues the reader in to the plot-lines that give the story direction. There is, however, so much more meaning in a deeper reading of the tale. It is most certainly women's literature: telling the life stories, struggles, and successes of a variety of women. Most interestingly for this reader, the tale spans a century; enabling Morton to tell the story of both a contemporary woman and her Victorian counterparts, and to draw similarities between. This is one of the novel's major accomlishments-- the telling of a Victorian-style novel (read Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights...) in a modern way-- making it reachable for a broader audience. Its length is perhaps reminiscent of the great British novelists of the Victorian era, but dear reader, trust that the pages turn quickly as you delve deeper into the mystery of ALL of the characters' pasts.     A true magician of words, Morton excersizes her skill. She tells so many stories, weaving them in and out of each other. If that weren't accomplishment enough, she colors the narrative by including in their entirety the fairy tales mentioned in the narrative. In a close study, the fairy tales are interesting because though they are uncomplicated tales, they ring with the mystery and magic the main story has but does not flaunt. Morton's passion for writing is apparent as she tells her readers a variety of stories, in a variety of ways: Victorian, contemporary, fairy tale.     Morton's novel is a welcome change from cheap and smutty \\"modern\\" books (do they deserve the title of novel?) being sold by the millions today. This reader was impressed with her prowess as a story-teller, and touched to see that women still recognize that the struggles of yesterday for us are the struggles also of today and tomorrow; that there is something to be gleaned from our predecessors...and ultimately, that women novelists care about more than shopping and alcohol.

B0037W68F4|5.0|MGMT's eagerly awaited follow up is finally here, featuring 9 songs that cut right to the chase. Unlike the Electronic Dance/Pop sound of their debut \\"Oracular Spectacular\\", this pursues a more alternative bent with angular shifts and loads of Beach Boys-style harmonies. Nothing like \\"Kids\\" or \\"Electric feel\\" for those expecting more of the same. They stated their aim was to make a single-free, hit-free album (leading to banging of heads and phrases like \\"Career suicide!\\" bandied about at their record label, I'm sure), one that will be taken as a whole. This they largely achieve by writing experimental pieces without killer hooks and choruses which grow richer each time you listen.<br /><br />Opening is the sunny surf-sounding rocker \\"It's working\\" (with eerie harmonies and  shifting percusion), while \\"Song for Dan Tracy\\" is more left-center (with lyrics following its name sake as he wanders around creeks and cobblestone lanes with a tear in his eye).<br /><br />The experimental Prince-style \\"Someone's missing\\" is a falsetto sung retro-sounding ballad with chiming guitars and a more rousing coda. \\"Flash delirium\\" starts off with pulsing synths before jangly guitars sweep in, while \\"I found a whistle\\" is a mellifluous acoustic ballad on which the falsetto is whipped out again.<br /><br />The epic 12 minute \\"Siberian breaks\\" is a lovely psychedelic ballad with unexpected signature changes with a warbly other-worldly coda.<br /><br />\\"Brian Eno\\" is a catchy frenetic rocker, followed by the sweeping cinematic instrumental piece \\"Lady Dada's nightmare\\". Closing is the title track \\"Congratulations\\", a sombre ballad sung in a lower register against an ornate keyboard riff, fittingly ending in light applause.<br /><br />It's arguable if this betters their debut, but what is undeniable is that despite the cartoon artwork (which I feel goes better with the fun Pop sound of their debut), this is an ambitious CD well executed. Congratulations lads, you have earned it!
B0019LY5IM|4.0|The disc has frozen up a couple times, but otherwise a great value for the money.
B003405MF6|5.0|65 year old British guitar virtuoso Jeff Beck's new album \\"Emotion & Commotion\\" is a largely instrumental work, featuring a 64 piece orchestra on some tracks, and guest vocalists Imelda May on the lush Jazzy \\"Lilac wine\\", and a fiery Joss Stone on both the Bluesy \\"I put a spell on you\\" and the experimental Soul \\"There's no other me\\". Stone repays a favour as Beck appeared on the track \\"Parallel lines\\" from her \\"Color me free\\" album.<br /><br />Opening is the mournful hymn \\"Corpus Christi carol\\" with majestic theatrical strings. In a similar mould are the upbeat \\"Hammerhead\\" (with guitars squealing and growling in turn), the melancholic yet groovy \\"Never alone\\", a tender reading of \\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\" (with a haunting guitar riff), and \\"Nessum dorma\\", all beautiful.<br /><br />The midtempo smooth Jazz \\"Serene\\" is just that, while the beautiful dirge \\"Elegy for Dunkirk\\" features Olivia Safe adding some operatic fluorish without lyrics. Her vocals and the guitar intertwine at times till you can't distinguish between them.<br /><br />It's amazing the amount of emotion Beck is able to wring out of his guitar (though I hear little or no commotion). This is an album that perfectly conveys emotion. Splendid stuff!
0316044695|4.0|I first read about the story of a wounded American Navy SEAL found and rescued by a village in Afghanistan, who bravely refused to turn him over to the Taliban in an article in Newsweek which appeared April 17, 2006.  Here is the link to the article:  [...]   When my book club chose \\"Lone Survivor,\\" I sensed immediately that it was the same story (confirmed by reading it).  So here is my message to Marcus:      Dear Marcus,   Maybe I'm not expressing it as clearly and urgently as I could.  So let me tell you this story (on the bestseller lists in bookstores):  A man seeking refuge from the mafia hides out in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia.  His odyssey of several days ends with him with near death wounds from the mafia that are nursed by the people in a small village in West Virginia.  They are too poor to own a car, so they carry him for miles, even in the onset of a blizzard.  From doing so, they wind up with permanent frostbite wounds. When the man comes back to civilization, he is hailed as a hero who fought the mafia.  From the publicity, the state of West Virginia gives the village paved roads and a generator, which is a great improvement.  Except that the people in the village are still living with death threats from the mafia, they have leaky roofs making it freezing in winter, they still have to use outhouses because they have no running water, and there is no doctor around for miles and miles.  Meanwhile, the man goes on to write a memoir of his experience of how the impoverished, indigent people of the village rescued him from the mafia and makes millions of dollars from this story.    So if the man is a good, Christian man, what would he do with the millions of dollars he is making from telling the story?  One thing that he could do would be to build a medical clinic for the peole in the village in Appalachia!!!  So . . . what is the only difference between my fictional story and your real life story?  The color of the people's skin, their ethnic background, their religion?  If you're Afghan and you're poor and Muslim as well, then you're dirt and you're not worth anything?  No, of course not, that's not what a true Christian thinks.  And I know that YOU don't think like that.  I just want to remind you that you can do something to help these people.    Marcus, I am really hoping that when your movie comes out this year, it will end with some actual real life footage of you presenting a medical clinic to Sarawa and Mohammad Gulab Wouldn't that make a great ending?  Maybe you're already planning it.  You have this unique opportunity to be not ONLY a wonderful wartime hero, but a wonderful real time hero as well, who helps real people trapped in danger and poverty!
B001HN694K|2.0|Tim Burton's version of Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is 98% Tim Burton and 2% Lewis Carroll. Like other versions of the Victorian classics, Burton's interpretation combines the two separate stories \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\", but this time so many liberties have been taken with the two plots there is almost no recognizable resemblance. Burton has tried here to run all the box-office bases: cute talking animals for the kids, violent special effects for teenaged boys, and a feminist heroine for young women. The combination seems awfully contrived and the picture completely lacks Lewis Carroll's charm and cleverness. I have to doubt that Linda Woolverton, in creating her screenplay, really gave that much attention to the original stories. For instance, in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" the monster's name is Jabberwock, not Jabberwocky -- it's the mock epic itself which is called Jabberwocky. Also, Tweedledee and Tweedledum are much more schizoid in Lewis Carroll than the sitcom pair presented here. The Red Queen has been combined with the Queen of Hearts, and her rivalry with her sister the White Queen takes on a Broadway slant à la \\"Wicked\\". Completely new characters -- a fierce knight and a friendly dog -- only add to the considerable clutter. The Mad Tea Party is not so much mad as sloppy slapstick, though I have to admit that Disney's 1951 version is not much better in this respect. (That version of \\"Alice is Wonderland\\" is my least favorite Disney, though I don't include the inanities of the past few years.)  In fact, there is almost nothing 19th Century about Burton's movie, and that includes the framing story of Alice being married off to an oaf. (Alice is nineteen years old in this version, and her return to Wonderland causes a lot of bother as to whether or not she is the real Alice.)  Needless to say, Tenniel's illustrations have been completely ignored, in favor of loud and overbearingcreations produced (I assume) with CGI. I'm not certain what Burton was trying to achieve here. Was he trying to be adept, hip, advanced, all of the above? Well, he failed. His Wonderland is a flat and unimaginative excuse for fantasy.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I stayed up late last night to get this and thought I would listen to it for a bit before bed.  Nearly 2 hours later I was still awake finishing the disk and went to bed with the biggest smile on my face at 1am.

B000VS6R26|3.0|Back in the early 2000's, I used to watch James Cameron's Titanic numerous times when it was still on VHS. Now that I come back to it, my appreciation of the film has slightly waned. I'd still recommend it, but only for specific reasons. The flaws are clearer to me now than back when I still had a VCR player. First off, I would like to say that the dialogue is truly cheesy. The words spoken by the main characters (especially Jack, Rose, and Cal) come straight out of a sappy soap opera. Plus, the love story is one for the female audience; men won't be interested in it, anyway. I myself don't find the love story very intriguing, but at least we care for the main leads. But dialogue and romance aside, the film remains a visual masterpiece. The ship looks fantastic. It is so accurately detailed (the staircase, the boiler rooms, the promenade deck, etc.), that it almost looks exactly like the real RMS Titanic. And of course, we shouldn't forget about the second half of the film. Believe it or not, the sinking of the ship is one of the most spectacular displays of tragedy ever put on film. It's still amazing that 1,500+ people perished in the Atlantic.<br /><br />Again, the sappy romance and the horrible dialogue (and a small fragment of James Horner's score) are the weakest links of the film, but the rest of the film works. Watch Titanic for its astonishing visuals, and for the powerful second half of the film.<br /><br />Grade: C+
B00288KNL8|4.0|If Up hadn't come out this year - this would have easily been a winner at the Oscars.  Clever, beautifully done and you always gotta love the stop motion animation.  The story is phenomenal, and Neil Gaiman makes a kids tale, seem almost too dark.  Almost.  He's always on the cuspe.  (Such as [[ASIN:B002WUC5R2 The Graveyard Book (Hardcover)]])  Still a delightful story and movie, with lessons to be learned!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|George Romero's 1978 horror film features 4 people trapped<br />in a shopping mall fighting hungry zombies.

0307463745|3.0|REWORK contains some great ideas, but none of them are sufficiently fleshed out. Each chapter is only a page or two long, so when you finish the chapter it feels like you have just read an introduction. When you turn the page, on to a new topic. With each chapter, I felt hungry for much more.     There are also many contradictions in this book, so it is difficult to determine if the advice is worth heeding. For example, one recurring theme is to focus on what you are good at, so you can hone your ideas and make an excellent quality product. Then there is a conflicting theme that says not to be a perfectionist, okay is good enough, fix it later. Maybe if they provided some more details or examples, I could parse exactly what they mean and apply their advice to my business.    Lastly, this book is written on an elementary school reading level. The authors of the book pride themselves on communicating this way, but I find it annoying.
0753820250|3.0|The first half of this book was fantastic. I thought, \\"At last! A decent writer!\\" Soon afterward the story drags on as each new character (of seemingly dozens) adds only one small clue after retelling ad nauseum what you already know. This makes for a very long book.<br />Quite suddenly, the thread of the story breaks altogether.  Daniel gets a letter which comprises the remaining half of the book, in prose utterly devoid of style or cleverness, telling us the remaining secrets rather than showing them. It is as if the film broke halfway through the movie and the kindly but uneducated projectionist tries to explain to you and your date what happens in the rest of the film.<br />In the end, there is only one twist (which you kick yourself for not having guessed earlier). Even worse, the man with no face is exactly who I thought it would be from page one, which was a great disappointment. If you know Kafka, you know the ending.<br />I'm left with the questions, \\"What happened? How could a great book go so sour?\\"<br />So I give it three stars, based on the average of five stars for the first half and one star for the last.<br />I'll give this author another chance. One. Any recommendations?

B00008PW3Q|2.0|Say You Will being Fleetwood Mac's 17th studio album and 2003 and is a straightforward rock album. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with photos of the band. The problem with this release is that it is just not that interesting. Many of the tracks sound like b sides from their earlier singles releases. Allmusic gives this record 3/5 and I think this is a little high. To me it is a 2.5 but since I can not give this grade it gets a strong 2. 2/5.

B00383YC2S|4.0|Ok, so as one of Aliz&eacute;e's fans since the beginning - I'm not going to go in the technicalities of it all - I'm just going to get straight into rating of the album. In comparison to Aliz&eacute;e's previous 3 albums, this one is far more electronic and 'techno' in sound. It's very eclectic and a more mature depiction of her. It's certainly different from her previous 3 releases. And it's a good improvement over her last album released in 2007 `Psych&eacute;d&eacute;lices'. The album is certainly worth buying.<br /><br />So here's my rating:<br /><br />1 = First-class/Good Track...  ½ = Not too Bad/Ok...  0 = Not working<br /><br />1. Eden, Eden = 1<br />2. Grand Central = 1<br />3. Limelight = ½<br />4. La Candida = 1<br />5. Les Collines (Never Leave You) = 1<br />6. 14 D&eacute;cembre = 1<br />7. &Agrave; Coeur Fendre = 1<br />8. Factory Girl = ½<br />9. Une Fille Difficile = ½<br />10. Mes Fantômes = 1<br /><br />Total = 8½ / 10.<br />* However, I am going to subtract a ½ because I think the sound at times on some tracks could have been a bit more sophisticated in their production. Further, as a devoted Aliz&eacute;e fan, I expected the Album Photography to be much better - she's so beautiful, and I think they let that go to waste throughout the whole album in this regard. Sometimes Artists do well when they break away, but I strongly believe Aliz&eacute;e should get Myl&egrave;ne Farmer and Laurent Boutonnat back in terms of her music; as well as her new image.<br /><br />Thus I'm rating this album as 8/10 (or) 4/5.<br /><br />Laslty, here's my comparative rating of this album to her previous releases:<br /><br />* Gourmandises (2000) =  9 / 10<br />* Mes courants &eacute;lectriques (2003) =  9 / 10<br />* Psych&eacute;d&eacute;lices (2007) = 6½ / 10

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I have read every Sherlock Holmes story and seen every movie and television version of Sherlock Holmes. I really like the Basil Rathbone movies but one reviewer is quite correct that they strayed considerably from the original stories. I also liked this movie version based on the original stories. While there are a lot of things I could nitpick about this movie, overall I found it quite interesting to see a very different (than what most people define as SH) version.    Who will like this movie is a good question.   If you are like me and pretty much like every variety of Sherlock Holmes then you should like this movie. If you are a Holmes purist regarding the originals then you might also like the movie. If you believe however that Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett is the \\"real\\" Holmes then you probably will take exception to this movie. It is also quite obvious from some of the reviewers that they have a rather narrow expectation of Sherlock Holmes, if this is your case then skip this movie. If you are looking for an entertaining version of SH and can ignore mistakes and are not a nitpicker then you might also like this movie. If you want perfection in the story, perfection in the settings and perfection overall then certainly skip this movie. This is simply an entertaining version of Sherlock Holmes.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I needed an HDMI cable for my Playstation 3 because I paid to much to have 480p resolution on it. I was depressed about having to buy an HDMI cable due to the fact that I coulden't find one for under $30.00, so I looked online and found this one. It is great, it work perfectly and I'll prbably get the same one for my 360. Overall, very pleased.
B002OHDRF2|5.0|As soon as I found out they were making another Terminator I was like \\"oh. no! Not again!\\" I loved the first two movies (Classic scfi), but the third movie was less than exceptional. When I learned however, that Christian Bale would play John Connor, my attention was grabbed. Suddenly I wanted to see it. So, saw it in the theatre and not only was it good, it was great! To my additional suprise Sam Worthington (whom I had never seen before) in my opion was as good (if not better than) Christian Bale in his role as Marcus Wright. His character was so believable, you find yourself cheering him on, wanting him to survive. MCG did an excellent job with this movie! By the time the credits rolled, I was hoping MCG and Bale would team up for another go. I pre-ordered the DVD I liked it that much!
B0000028RR|5.0|There is something about this album that I can't put my finger on, it seems to have some of type of control over me. I still listen to this album just about every single day. That's how powerful Rage Against the Machine's music really is. It's completely different from many other bands out there, lyrically and instrumentally. Tom Morello's guitar riffs really are something, probably some of the best guitar playing I've heard in a long time.  And of course can't forget Zach's powerful lyrics, inspired by freestyle rap. Each song from this album is different from each other, while they may carry the same political message, they're all gems to my ears. This album is the greatest thing to come from 1990s, and probably one of the greatest albums of all time.
B000CEVUIK|5.0|I love scifi and this is a great scifi show. The characters are likeable (some are even loveable) the stories flow smoothly and (mostly) make sense. This show only got better with time! It's to bad SCYFY canned it. Here's to hoping for straight to dvd movies :)!
B0039OGGVQ|1.0|Very little thought and effort was put in this milquetoast exercise.  It sounds like Slash had all his guest vocal artists lined up outside his studio door, and let them in one by one for a 5 minute recording session.  Music by queuing system.  Worst of all, Slash's by the numbers guitar playing is more uninspired than the drive-by singing.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|As someone who grew up on a farm I knew a lot of this stuff but it's amazing how our world has changed in the 40 years since. So much isn't what it seems. The movie is highly recommended for anyone who cares about what they eat or the health of the planet or how corporations are eroding the quality of our lives. It's all in the name of profit margin and pleasing stockholders or CEOs. What we need is a whole lot more \\"Undercover Boss.\\"

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is the first book in a dystopian trilogy (third book set to come out in August 2010) by Suzanne Collins, author of the children's series the Underland Chronicles. In The Hunger Games Panem, a futuristic North America, is divided into 13 Districts. Every year a boy and girl age 18 or younger must be sent from each district to participate in the Hunger Games. Collins tracks the journey of 16 year old Katniss from District 12 through her participation in the Hunger Games. Collins artfully crafts this intense novel from Katniss' point of view, requiring the reader to constantly piece information together along with Katniss in her quest for survival. Since Collins knows Katniss intimately, the reader is able to develop a close attachment to Katniss and to other characters through her eyes. Far from being laborious, her quest is riveting and leaves the reader hungry for more.     The prospect of using a dystopian society as the theme of a novel is not new, and  but Collins includes a rather fresh and scathing comment on the media, government, and what it might become as she uses aspects of current media practices to make her point. Collins comments on the role of media, its potential power and the advocacy of superficiality, with particular emphasis on the dangers and absurdity of reality television. Her comments on media and reality TV also directly relate to control of the masses. The citizens of Panem are only able to view, experience, and communicate that which the government deems appropriate. This results in the extreme oppression and isolation of citizens who are not allowed to leave their own districts and only hear rumors of what goes on in others.     Further emphasizing Collins' theme of isolation is the fact that she did not include a map of Panem in The Hunger Games. This is at once frustrating and intriguing. The lack of a map showing the division of North America is frustrating at times, considering how significant location is to the overall themes of the book. Conversely, the lack of map also provides the opportunity for the reader to learn about Panem as Katniss does, furthering the connection between character and reader, since the reader only has Katniss' knowledge base.    Though Collins' subject matter in The Hunger Games, much like her Underland Chronicles, is dark and her characters face difficult, life-threatening  and often gruesome choices, the book is thought-provoking, suspenseful and entertaining. It contains many of the ideas regarding government control that are present in The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood and manipulation of the young as in Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. The Hunger Games is a good read for any young adult looking for an action-packed book filled with daunting possibilities of a dystopian future.

0061703257|4.0|I opted to read the book rather than go see the movie. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is believable. I was hooked from early in book. Read Kindle edition so cannot say by what page, but certainly within the first 20 pages. My wife and I have a hundred page rule, if by then we are not into the book I will not waste my time. It is dark and always left me disturbed. That is good the author kept me literally on the island. I think this is a must read.
159562015X|5.0|I've read \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" as well as this book.  This book is a fantastic resource for finding out where your raw talents lie.  The main reason to buy this book is so that you can take the Clifton Strengthsfinder online and discover your raw talents.  I would also recommend \\"Go, Put Your Strengths To Work\\", which is a more practical book that describes how to use your strengths at work.    Really the dream team for strengths were Clifton and Buckingham who were the authors of \\"Now...\\".  Buckingham went his own way, and so both authors of \\"Now...\\" ended up making a sequel to the book.  Instead of reading \\"Now...\\" I would recommend people get both sequels: \\"Strengths Finder 2.0\\" and \\"Go...\\".

B003405MF6|5.0|NOMINATED FOR FIVE GRAMMY AWARDS. MONUMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS \\"Elegy For Dunkirk\\",\\"Corpus Christi Carol\\",\\"Hammerhead\\", \\" Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\",\\"Nessum Dorma\\" and \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\"    \\"Emotion and Commotion\\" is Jeff Beck's newest studio album in the aftermath of his gloriously frenetic Jeff CD (2003). This CD is another classic but it's far different than all his previous releases. An Orchesta and three female vocalists play major roles and the CD embraces classical, opera, new age and cinematic genres in addition to Beck's awesome rock, blues and jazz fusion forte.    The opening track is a marvellous interpretation of \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" that features Beck playing sustained single notes that swoop and soar with the stirring hurt of a human voice. The ensuing \\"Hammerhead\\" is laden with Beck's arsenal including wah wah pedal, whammy bar dynamics, brawny riffs and knifing solos. Song three is the virtuosic \\"Never Alone\\" which has a new age sound that is audibly assuaging. \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" is a major highlight as the guitar weeps and laments with a visceral tone that only Jeff Beck can coax and caress. Joss Stone energetically sings \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" accompanied by some stellar funk and blues chops delivered by Beck.    \\"Serene\\" is a pastoral and bucolic instrumental that further demonstrates Beck's eclecticism and it's bolstered by great bass playing and atmospheric soundscapes. Next is \\"Lilac Wine\\" sung by Irish phenom Imelda May. It's a nice song that imbues the album with some torch and pure jazz. It transitions into the poignant, edgy and ravishing \\"Nessun Dorma\\" that fuses Beck's fretboard prowess with the rousing sounds of the orchesta. (\\"Nessun Dorma\\" has been an incredible live performance at Jeff Beck's 2010 US concerts without the orchestra.) Joss Stone returns to sing \\"There's No Other Me\\", but the star is Beck who delivers some explosive and psychedelic sounds.    The emotive and stunning \\"Elegy For Dunkirk\\" closes the album. Beck's riffs and notes are replete with heartrending pathos that ascend to astounding beauty as Olivia Safe's wordless but angelic vocals help to compel the listener to be awed by the grandeur of a song that is almost on a par with the inimitably transcendent \\"Where Were You.\\"    Note: The Japanese CD has an adroitly austere and melancholic instrumental song \\"Cry Me A River in addition to the captivating \\"Poor Boy\\" that is sung by Imelda May.    Jeff Beck is not a great writer or composer and he's indebted to people like George Martin, John McLaughlin and Tony Hymas who have inspired him. However, no other guitarist can create and generate such a plethora of otherworldy, sensitive and blistering sounds and tones with bare fingers and very few effects. Jeff Beck's a nonpareil guitarist who is invariably revered by his axeman peers ranging from the late Les Paul to Joe Satriani.
B002VECM4A|5.0|I have not looked at this movie yet, but I have followed the stars on the award shows, the publicity.  I am sure that I will like it; that is why I purchased it.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series and I saw this movie on the midnight premier when it was released in theaters! I loved the movie, it's something I was wanting to see for a long time, a movie about the future war against skynet. Christian Bale did a great John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright was great too! The movie stayed very true to the previous 3 movies and stuck to the time line way better then T3 did.... When I entered the movie theater, I didn't have any great expectations though, because I'm not a fan of Mc G's previous movies and didn't really think he could pull it off, but he did it. There's been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but trust me, if you are a true Terminator fan, you are going to love this movie! The action scenes are great, the plot is familiar and also has a little something that feels new and fresh. The actors / actresses did a great job in their rolls and the machines were amazing!  I personally think this is the best Terminator movie since T2 and I give the movie 5 stars out of 5, but now to the DVD review.....     The Special edition DVD is good, but honestly could've been better and I'm still kind of trippin cuz Mc G promised us a 30-40 minute longer version a long with a bunch of special features, but instead we got about a 20 minute \\"making of\\" documentary and a few other extras, not much at all... The Blu-Ray I still haven't seen, but I've heard that there's a few more extras that I wish they would've added. I'm glad I didn't go buy the regular DVD, because the regular DVD just has the PG-13 movie and no extras and that is really screwing fans over IMO.  Anyway if you're a REAL Terminator fan, I suggest you add this to your collection, don't mind what the dumb critics say about this movie, because honestly this is one of the best action movies I've seen in a very long time and a great addition to the Terminator franchise. IMO Terminator Salvation is the best Terminator movie since T2: Judgment Day!

Amazon wil refund USD$3.99, but I am going to pay a whole bunch more to ship it back from Australia.    I ended up buying the paperback version in the meantime.

0142410705|4.0|Very fun book.    I don't want to go into too much detail, since this writer is already obviously well-established in the literary world and his value is undisputed, but aside from the occasional stiltedly age-awkward dialogue (\\"dingleberries?\\" Really?), the internal struggles and ever-changing social dynamics are spot-on. Throw in the fun of anagrams and you're set for a snag ram of a good read.

B00000C28M|4.0|I've been seeking out Bernstein's earlier live recordings during his New York Philharmonic years ever since I came across a stimulating historical release of his Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony live from 1958 (IDIS 6577) that was conducted with such urgency and exhilaration, a stark contrast to his studio recording on Sony recorded the same year.   Over the years, I've come to relish live recordings to hear conductors and artists as they actually sounded to concert audiences; artists often proclaim that the presence of an audience can bring about added spontaneity and excitement that is difficult to achieve in a sterile studio environment.  So far, my conclusion is that 1950s/60s Bernstein live is much more exciting and persuasive than Bernstein in the studio.  (Of course, DG recorded Bernstein live from the 1970s and 80s where he broadened his tempi that works for many pieces, e.g., Brahms Fourth Symphony or Sibelius First Symphony with Vienna [my personal favorites], but not for others, e.g., Elgar's Enigma Variations [avoid at all costs!].)    I'm not sure if this 1962 live recording of Brahms's mighty Piano Concerto No. 1 helps support my conclusions about Bernstein's added vitality in the concert hall compared to the studio, however, as right off we have Bernstein's pre-performance pronouncement that this performance will have significantly broader tempi, yielding to the wishes of his soloist, Glenn Gould.    While others have provided the background on the historic nature of this recording, I will only add that Bernstein's speech is actually quite witty, and the audience laughs and reacts with seeming anticipation.  For me, it is episodes like this that make live recordings worthwhile!  Repeated listening of this speech, however, could grow tiresome during casual listening.    My experience with Brahms's first Piano Concert has centered on two recordings, the Curzon/Szell/London Symphony recording on Decca and the Douglas/Sinaisky/USSR Academic Symphony (also live) on Melodiya.  While this Gould/Bernstein recording is indeed slower than either of these other excellent recordings that I've enjoyed for years - evident right from the very opening bars of the first movement - it is not that exaggerated or very far outside the bounds of reason (some may even be disappointed by this!).  In fact, the pace of the performance seems to foreshadow how Bernstein would evolve later in his career (as others have pointed out, this performance is actually a tad quicker than Bernstein's later DG recording with Zimerman).  Gould's playing is contemplative and measured, but never ponderous nor lethargic by any means.    At the end of the performance, the audience applauds enthusiastically with none of the reported booing (perhaps the applause is faded out beforehand).   Gould claimed he appreciated the booing, sensing that he had made a provocative statement, which he preferred over complacent audience acceptance of his performance ideas.      Being a re-mastered radio broadcast, this recording is not stereo, and it suffers from a quite audible bronchially-congested audience.  For purists and audiophiles of modern sound, these problems may make them dismiss this recording out of hand.  However, the sound is very clear and ranks with the very best radio broadcast recordings I've heard from this vintage!  I do recommend this recording to fans of either Bernstein or Gould and for those willing to survey historic and live performances that have marked important milestones or shaped the discourse of classical music.  Indeed, this recording is still discussed on these pages and elsewhere.  For me, it is more than just a curiosity and is enjoyable in its own right (given my interest in live recordings).      Before posting this review, I re-listened to the Curzon and Douglas recordings for some direct comparisons.  Szell's opening of the first movement for Curzon is faster and more dramatic with a greater sense of forward movement so that the music's structure is better articulated.  Curzon's Adagio (second movement) is actually more than two minutes longer than Gould's rendition.  And of course, the great Decca sound (recorded a month after the Gould performance) is truly outstanding, even by today's digital recording standards.   Douglas' live recording is even faster paced with the expected spontaneity and excitement of a live event with an audience that is amazingly quiet until their fervent applause at the end (indeed, this Melodiya recording is of Douglas' performance at the 8th International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition from July 3, 1986, in which he won the gold medal - clearly, an important milestone event!).   I'm sure I'll be pulling the Gould recording off the shelf on occasion, but I'm not replacing either of my studio Curzon or live Douglas recordings anytime soon!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie came out before Obama was ever thought of ever being President of the United States with his health care plan. It is about the wrong in our country with our failing health care system. It was one of the worlds best years ago but now it is behind other major countries health care, even Cuba's. I wish everyone would watch this movie and see it with open minds and leave politics out of their mind while viewing. It is NOT about politics, it is about you and your families health care. Even if you have a plan today, you may find it gone tommorow or full of excuses on why it won't pay for anything.  This is not a boring movie. As in other Rogers Moores films, they are lots of funny moments but the real story about what our health care in America has evolved into is not so funny.

B001ILHY2C|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters. I am still surprised at how good it actually was. I really didn't want to see it because it looked and sounded so stupid. But my girlfriend drug me to the movies to see it. In my opinion, this movie has all the makings of a good action movie. It has a plot, not much of a plot, but it is there, and its not like everything happens at the beginning and the rest of the movie is just pointless violence, the story actually unfolds between scenes of violence. A small twist here and there. Hot girls, good special effects. And the best part, no sex scene. I hate sex scenes in action movies, especially long drawn out ones, its a waste of time and is only put there because they wanted to make the movie longer so they inserted a scene that has no plot value whatsoever, but why have plot when you can have boobs? I'm sorry but i'm not going to pay $9 a person to watch someone else get laid.     The setting of the movie is a little farfetched but somewhat realistic. Bad economy, the country is failing, there aren't enough taxes to keep the prison system running, so the prisons are bought out by private companies. The game Death Race is created as a way to get rich and as an alternative to the death penalty. A simple yet creative idea.     There is a lot of violence with blood and gore. However, it is focused moreso on the action and violence than the blood and gore. Meaning the blood and gore is only there to compliment the action, so they didn't rely on the blood and gore to make the movie.     Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson are both good actors and they both fit their parts well. A working class white guy whose employer had to shut down, gets framed and goes to prison where he gets drug into playing the game and slowly uncovers the plot to milk him for all of the money he is worth by the greedy female warden. Then a black guy who has been in prison and has been playing the game for a long time, he is determined to be the bestand win his freedom but always gets the shaft, once again thanks to the greedy female warden.     Plot, action, violence, good special effects, good acting, no wasting your time with a boring love story. After listing all of those things I have just realized that this movie is the polar opposite of the Twilight series. So, if you are like me and hate the Twilight saga because it is nothing but a bunch of emotional crap aimed at, like, teenage girls who can, like, so relate to, like, having a vampire boyfriend. And you believe that vampire movie without violence is like a car without an engine, you can get into it if you want to be its not like your gonna go anywhere with it, Death Race might be a good movie for you.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|Once in a while, and more frequently in this genre than most others it seems; a film comes along with a very modest budget (in this case $5M), a limited cast, and a whole lot of heart.  In the case of Moon, director Duncan Jones continues on in the tradition of works like Danny Boyle's Sunshine or perhaps even more appropriately, Neil Blomkamp's District 9.  However, its inclusion in the oft-suspect category of independent science fiction entertainment is by no means synonymous with cheesy rubber masks, shoddy sets, or below par CGI; in fact quite contraire.  Moon manages to accomplish a surprising deal of well-written plot structure and melds it with consistent, appropriate and believable visuals (whether special effect shots or otherwise).  Amidst the current trend of bloated CG-overloaded \\"blockbusters\\" that attempt to make up for their lack of substance with flashy visuals, Moon is a refreshing diversion to say the least.<br /><br />The tale centers on Sam Bell, the only man living on the moon in an undisclosed future date (but based on the technology, certainly the foreseeable future), who is nearing the conclusion of a three-year contract to work for Lunar Industries.<br /><br />As the lone employee stationed at their lunar facility, Sam's primary job responsibility is to harvest and periodically ship (via rocket) to Earth supplies of helium-3; the clean and apparently extremely abundant fuel source used by future society.<br /><br />In addition to the loneliness Sam experiences in complete isolation, there apparently is no direct communication link available between the lunar station and Earth.  Fortunately he does experience a good deal of daily interaction with GERTY; an artificially intelligent computer/ robot that tends to his daily needs (voiced brilliantly by Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />While the viewer is treated to a heartfelt demonstration of Sam's almost singular desire to complete his contract and return to Earth to be with his wife Tess and their infant daughter Eve, things start to get very interesting when with only two weeks to go, he gets into a rover accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious.<br /><br />To continue on with the plot summation would not only provide critical spoilers (something I despise personally and make a practice of avoiding in my critiques) but it would also jeopardize some of the most spectacular moments of the prose whereby the viewer, through the bewilderment of the lead character, discovers that all is not as it initially appears.<br /><br />What is revealed as the layers of mystery are rolled back like the skin of so many proverbial onions is actually a subliminally sad account of the cruelty of the human mind and the frailty of the human body.  And while there is undeniable hope to be found in the tale's conclusion, it comes with the bittersweet lacing of the would ifs, could ifs and what-nows that are left for the viewer to ponder once the credits roll.  This fact alone is nearly a guarantee that the film will continue popping up in your thoughts for days, maybe even weeks after viewing.  In fact I'm thoroughly convinced that this is one of those rare pieces that, like a fine wine, requires a lengthy period of digestion (processing) to fully appreciate.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell's performance of lead character Sam Bell is remarkable upon first impression and perhaps even more so upon examination of the unique capture process in the film's \\"making of\\" documentaries.<br /><br />Speaking of, the single disc DVD boasts a surprisingly robust extra-feature set including two full-length commentary tracks (one with Writer/Director Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery and Production Designer Tony Noble and the second with Writer/Director Duncan Jones again and Producer Stuart Fenegan), \\"Whistle\\" a Short Film by Duncan Jones, The Making of Moon, Creating the Visual Effects, Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones, a Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival, and like a whole lot of Sony trailers.<br /><br />About the biggest complaint I've encountered surrounding the project would have to be gripes that the prose isn't action-packed, particularly comedic, or even that the pacing is a bit tedious.  While I cannot dispute all such claims, I can assure that the cleverness of the script is solid enough to command even the most restless viewer's curiosity.  Coming in at a runtime of 97-minutes, there is no fluff or unnecessary plotting to cloud the potency of the tale.<br /><br />In all it is very easy to recommend this piece of independent science fiction as it represents the culmination of all that is wrong with big budget filmmaking these days by contrast.  The fact that Sony Classics was wise enough to recognize this reality is hopeful of things to come in and of itself.  Duncan Jones deserves credit on having written and directed a wonderfully entertaining motion picture that will, hopefully be only the first of many such future developments.a whole lot of Sony trailers.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Us old guys have all seen Basil Rathbone in the original Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1940s, right? When I was a kid in the 60s & 70s they used to rerun them on Saturday mornings, and I must say that I found them intolerably boring. In 1939 Rathbone actually did the first ([[ASIN:B0001DCYBE The Hound of the Baskervilles]]) in what became a series of over a dozen sequels with him in the lead role.<br /><br />To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what this Guy Ritchie's 2009 version of Sherlock Holmes accomplishes.<br /><br />I have seen quotes suggesting that Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is \\"a travesty to the character that Conan Doyle created\\" and one particularly funny quote suggesting that \\"Robert Downey replacing Rathbone in Holmes was akin replacing Clark Gable with Eminem for a remake of Gone With the Wind.\\" But look, to me as long as the result is good I couldn't care less if a director takes liberties with what was originally created in print or on screen. I thought Downey made an excellent Holmes...but I doubt that I'd feel the same way with Eminem in Gone With the Wind. :-)<br /><br />In Ritchie's 2009 version of Holmes some if not most of the original's storyline is a bit...well...remade, but the remake gives this classic a beautiful 21st century treatment with good FX and cool scenery. It's full of action that made the 2-hour length of the movie go by before I was ready for an end.<br /><br />So for a remake, I was not only pleased but thoroughly entertained. Action fans, don't pass on this. Preservationists, you probably won't be happy.
0525421580|5.0|Awesome book!  Very fast read with charismatic characters that I am dying to hear more from. I keep hoping that I have more to read but then I realized I already finished it.  I would love a second installment. John and David have different writing styles and yet it all seemed to works perfectly together.
B002S0OBN2|2.0|If you are a fan of the original, then this is a must purchase, regardless of my review. However, if you are expecting a strong, powerful soundtrack, like its predecessor, this isn't it.  A couple of the songs are worthy of the original, but then others are actually irritating and get stuck in your head for all the wrong reasons. Overall, worth a listen, but likely to disappoint.

B00005JLPK|4.0|Having just read the book, The Lecuna, by Barbara Kingsolver I wanted a quick reference to the life of Frida Kalho.  I certainly received a wonderful picture of her, through the fully energetic portrayal by Selma Hayek.  Frida's talent, her independent mind,  her life time struggle with pain and her personal determination to express herself are all excellently portrayed.    Frida's paintings were recreated as \\"freeze frames\\" which came to life at various pivotal points though out the movie giving a powerful melding of her art and her circumstance.  The accurate historic Mexican folkloric costuming was stunning. Even the Casa Le Azul --her Blue House-- was accurately recreated.      The director has done a wonderfully artistic job while accurately depicting the times and the struggles Frida and Diego endured.  Listening to the interviews on DVD#2 were also fascinating.    I'll enjoy this movie again and again.
B00065F86U|5.0|Quality built. This battery cover mates with the EN-EL4 quite well. Price wise it's very much overpriced, should be priced at about one-half the current selling price.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|Great movie, and thought provoking on socio / economic relations.  Overall I rate it four out of five stars.  It bears a good watch every once in awhile.  Or at least until 12/23/2012.  :-)
B000NQR7R0|5.0|Inspired to purchase after watching the movie Kill Bill volume 2. Malaguena Salerosa was played at the end of the movie and as always been a favorite of mine. Great contemporary version of old time favorites.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the most informative DVDs that I have seen that spells it all out to us, the consumers, as to what has happened with the control from the big conglomerates who control our food supply.  Very very disturbing.
0061914177|4.0|Crush it is a result of our web 2.0 era.  Whether in the wine industry or any other, Gary hits the nail on the head suggesting that following your passion is your key to ultimate success.  His energy and enthusiasm for success is apparent and his desire to share that with others is admirable.  I apply some of his theories to my business and have excelled!  I have even recommended this book on my wine tour website.

B002MW50KO|5.0|I have lived with Christmas In The Heart for a few months with my opinion pinballing between inspired, strange, jarring or, just plain boring. No matter, as a Christmas album CITH succeeds admirably simply because it turns some of the well trodden holiday canon on its head - however, as a birthday album, I remain less convinced.  There are families today who think nothing about dropping significant coin on birthday celebrations for their children that would make some third-world plutocrats blush at their opulence and excess - I can only imagine their white hot rage and ensuing lawsuit histrionics if the trapeze artist, juggling troupe or Animal Planet snake charmer showed up drunk or stoned all but ruining the three-ring processional for little Chase or Cassandra.   Now imagine a parent's reaction if the true Eternal God were to punch up Dylan's Christmas In The Heart on His celestial iPod. After having lived through Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer or Ray Conniff's World of Christmas Strings, would He smile at Bob, just thankful for something different in tribute to His Son or would the grizzled, gargling with gasoline vocals finally push Him over the edge - it's hard to say how the Lord of Hosts - who has always been comfortable with a righteous smite, smote or pox - would handle the situation.  Despite his Christian dabbling, Dylan has really always been an Old Testament guy, so he, more than anyone, must know that the odds are definitely with the House on this one.   So, with hands trembling on the keyboard and eyes averted skyward for a wayward bolt of score settling lightening, I endorse Christmas In The Heart as an authentic roots classic that just may grow on you - and hopefully Him.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|My wife and I were interested in this movie.  She thought it looked interesting from what we saw on the Oscar awards show.  That a Sci-Fi flick was nominated alone was interesting.  I didn't think she'd want to see it, but she did, so we took a shot.<br /><br />We started watching it last night, and neither of us were expecting what we got.  The film was mostly a documentary style of movie.  The trailers we saw made it seem more like an ID4 kind of movie, not a film done as a documentary piece.  Both of us were turned off by it, and to be honest, about 45 minutes in, we were both bored.  I looked up the plot on Wikipedia on my iPad, read it out loud, and then we watched the last five minutes.<br /><br />Totally disappointed.  I would have given it one star, but the visual effects were very well done.  The film was made well, I recognize that, but I was totally let down by the kind of movie it was.  Didn't enjoy it, although I can recognize a well made film, even if I don't particularly care for it.<br /><br />Can't address the blu-ray specifically, as we rented it in HD from Amazon's video on demand store to our TiVo.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|The first thing I look for when I want to watch a new show on TV or go see a movie is if it has a Firefly cast member in it. If it does I know I will like it whatever it is. When I saw \\"Serenity\\" at the theater it was the first time I was happy to be at a sold out show ... every seat in the house was full ... usually I wait to see a film because I don't like to be disturbed by others, but in this instance I was happy to feel connected to so many people that felt the same way about the show that I did.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|I've read all the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Then I went to see the movie and was thoroughly disappointed. Although the most basic elements are there--Percy is a son of Poseidon, he's accused of stealing Zeus' master bolt and has to return it, his friends are Annabeth and Grover--that's about all they took from the book. About every other minute, I kept yelling (in my head) one of two things: \\"That NEVER happened!!\\" and \\"That event did NOT happen that way AT ALL!!\\" They left out about 90% of what happened in the book and changed virtually EVERYTHING that happened.    Differences between the book and movie (SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!):  * I think this is an important point: In the book, Percy is only 12 years old. In the movie, he looks about 15 or 16. I think this will create big problems later on, if they decide to make more PJ movies because there's a prophecy about Percy and his 16th birthday.  * In the book, Chiron was the one who sent them on the quest. In the movie, they sneak out against his orders.  * In the book, during capture the flag, Percy is not the one who finds the other team's flag and does NOT battle Annabeth. He fights Clarisse as a distraction so that Luke can grab the flag. In the movie, Clarisse is completely absent.  * In the book, the bus blows up after the 3 furies attack them. This is completely removed in the movie, though they did take a bus, but nothing happened.  * In the book, they're lured to Aunty Em's Gnome Emporium from hunger. There, Aunty Em feeds them burgers & fries. When Medusa attacks, it's Grover who wears the flying shoes and attacks her from the air. Then Percy sends Medusa's head in a package to Olympus. In the movie, no eating, Medusa's victim turns to stone while holding Annabeth's wrist, and the kids keep the head and are forced to leave a motel when a housekeeper sees Grover holding it.  * The Lotus Casino scene: In the movie, there's no hotel room and they are given lotus-shaped snacks that make them forget about the quest. In the book, no lotus snacks, there were more games appropriate to their age (instead of gambling), Grover's never surrounded by all those women, and they NEVER stole a fancy car!  * In the movie, the quest involves collecting 3 pearls from various places. In the book, they never went to any of those places and Percy was given the pearls by a naiad.  * In the book, there's a very important meeting and later a battle between Percy and Ares, god of War. In the movie, Ares isn't even mentioned, let alone present.  * In the book, Luke doesn't reveal his betrayal until the very end. He leaves Percy to be poisoned by a scorpion, the two never having actually battled each other, as in the movie.  * In the book, the master bolt appears magically in a backpack given to Percy by Ares. It was not hidden in the shield (which Luke never gave them, but which they acquired on a mini-quest assigned by Ares), as it did in the movie.  * In the book, Hades' helm of Darkness is also stolen by Luke along with Zeus' master bolt. In the movie, nothing is mentioned about the helm.  * In the book, it's Percy's mother who has to stay with Hades whereas in the movie, Grover volunteers to stay with him so that Percy can have his mother back.  * Probably most importantly, I don't remember Kronos ever being mentioned in the movie (since I only could only stand to see it once), whereas Kronos is the most crucial player in the entire story since he's the one that started the whole chain of events--and, in later books, becomes the main antagonist.  * There are many other smaller differences as well, such as when Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood, he doesn't go straight to the Poseidon cabin, since he's \\"undetermined\\" and isn't revealed as a son of Poseidon until after the capture-the-flag game. The camp itself looks nothing like it's described in the book, the gods don't appear as they are described in the book, and even Annabeth is written as a blond, not a brunette.    Long story short, if you've read the book, you'll likely be disappointed by the movie. If you haven't, then the movie will probably be OK, though it won't knock your socks off.
026110215X|5.0|This book is a must for any serious Tolkien fan. Like the name suggests, it's a host of 'unfinished tales' that flesh-out the history of Middle-Earth. The 20th anniversary edition has a beautiful dust jacket (illustration by J. R. R. Tolkien), a fold-out map in the back which is easy to access, and the binding and paper quality seem quite solid to me. Nicely done!    One warning I'll give to any novice Tolkien readers is that you should have already read the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings before attempting to read this if you really want to understand it and at the same time not spoil the other said books. Again, a must for the truly die-hard Tolkien fan!
B003B486OY|5.0|The third novel in the series, and also the final one. In this many loose threads are tidied up and we come to a reasonably satisfactory conclusion. Again, a page-turner, difficult to put down, as one finds oneself just reading one more page, one more chapter, one more hour, to find out the next unraveling of the mystery, or the next clue to unfolding events. Without giving away the plot, Salander faces a struggle for her physical survival and we find her preparing for the courtcase that will determine the rest of her life. She and Blomkvist became once more part of everyday life for a while, so much so that when I completed the book I actually really missed them for a few days.<br />Not perfect, but one of the better books I have read for a good while. The way issues such as political persuasion, corruption, personal morality and gender issues are addressed in the book add extra depth to the work. What a great author of the mystery genre, and what a crying shame we won't hear anynore from him. A classic upon release.
B0037W68F4|3.0|The first time I heard MGMT's new album, I thought of the interviews they had to give on the red carpet of the last Grammys. If you didn't see it, it was as awkward as interviews can be and at the time, it was clear that the band didn't want nothing to do with these people. What we didn't know at the time was that their hostile attitude would actually shape their entire next album, Congratulations. The band had also announced that there would be no more `Kids' or `Time to Pretend' and as soon as `Flash Delirium' came out, it was pretty obvious what went through their minds in the studio: `this time, let's do something that the mainstream will NOT dig'. If only this album was good.    The main thing that strikes me about Congratulations is that it's not only reactionary, but closed to itself and borderline-adolescent. It finds MGMT focusing too hard on making less accessible music, less catchy pop songs and even though structures are more adventurous and as trippy and enjoyable as it may be on acid, it leaves the sober listener craving for a lot more substance. The childhood nostalgia that characterized Oracular Spectacular is pretty much gone and that's fine, but MGMT tries to escape it by pushing too hard towards psych-pop experimentation.    It's still listenable, though. `It's Working' and `Congratulations' are decent opener and closer and `Flash Delirium' is a blast. Some people complain that it's not a single, and I agree. That's why it's awesome. It's crazy, all over the place and it keeps becoming something else. Then, there's my favorite cut, 'I Found a Whistle', a short and beautiful song with a hypnotic melody and a spectacular finale.    It's a clear case of Secondalbum Syndrome: trying too hard to move too far from the identity that the first album gave you. Anyway, an average MGMT album is still more refreshing than anything out there, so I'm happy. Yay!
0486424545|4.0|Speaking as one who wasn't there, I know, but...it seems to me that Howard's End captures perhaps more than any other book the spirit of the early 20th century. It deals with the morality, the intellectual revival and awakening of women and the community, the development of feminism, social mobility, the changing world and neo-imperialism. All these issues are approached through following 3 families over a period of years and life-changing events: the Schlegels, the Wilcoxes and the Basts. The theme for the novel, and one of its protagonist's motto is \\"only connect\\", and indeed by the end of the novel the three famiies have made an enduring connection. The lives of the characters, the time spirit and the detail make it an enjoyable read.
B000025WWO|5.0|Listen to her performances of Préludes Op. 32 (DG 1989), and 6 Moments Musicaux (Hänssler Classic 2006). And Listen to these performances of the Piano concertos No. 2 & 3.  Miss Zilberstein demonstrates her insights through all these works. Every note is there with tenderness and nostalgia in the quiet passages, and emotional opulence in the climaxes. Never lacks of poetry, and never lacks of strength. Memorable interpretations¡    This CD, recorded live in 1991 (no. 2) and 1993 (no. 3) is perfectly balanced, quite dynamic with a very good definition (though it shows slight signs of digital glare in the second).
0439023491|5.0|The first third of the book starts off slow, changing the setting for the plot from the arena of Book 1 back to District 12 for Book 2.  But in the second and last third of the book, the action picks up, and the main character moves away from the slow progression that allowed her to contemplate the future to a setting where she can only act and react.  By the end of this book, I was completely engrossed and am eagerly awaiting the third book in the series (due out August 24th!)

B000069AUI|5.0|If Coldplay's first album \\"Parachutes\\" put them on the map, then their sophomore effort \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head\\" established for them their own continent.<br /><br />Let's backtrack a bit...<br /><br />In the spring of 2003 I heard that Coldplay would be making a tour stop near my hometown.  At that point I already owned a copy of \\"Parachutes\\" which I had talked a friend into buying for me (don't ask me how, I guess I didn't want it bad enough to pay for it myself).  The main reason I wanted it and the only thing I really listened to on it was the song \\"Yellow\\"--probably the song that some would say Coldplay is most known for.  Needless to say I wasn't too much of a fan by then but since big name acts like this rarely, if ever, came through my neck of the woods I figured I'd better go to the concert just to check it out.<br /><br />After I purchased my ticket I figured it might be a good idea to buy a copy of their new album since that was what they were touring in support of.  I wanted to be able to seem cool and in order to do that I needed to be able to sing along to more than just one song.  I listened to the album a few times through and was gradually becoming more of a steady fan.  But the real turning point for me was seeing them in concert.  After that night I knew that from then on I was a Coldplay fan for life.<br /><br />If you've ever seen this band live then you know exactly what I'm talking about.  From their display of passion, intensity, and energy all the way to the amazing green laser that shone out and formed a kind of roof over the crowd's head during the song \\"Clocks\\", I was beaming from ear to ear the whole time.<br /><br />I've seen them in concert a total of three times now and their awesome live shows coupled with the fact that they simply make darn good music really makes these guys a force to be reckoned with in today's music scene whether you love them or hate them.<br /><br />Lots of bands like to claim that they have an \\"original\\" sound but more often than not I've found that the reality of the situation is that this is a total lie.  In Coldplay's case, especially with \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head\\", true originality not only presents itself, it rams itself down your throat.  Before this album came out and still to this day I have never heard an album quite like it (except for maybe elements of the band's follow-up \\"X&Y\\").<br /><br />This is one of those rare albums in life that would take entirely too long to list off everything about it that makes it great, but a few key points in the album (some of which will make you wish you knew how to play piano if you don't already) are:<br /><br />-The haunting chords of the album's opener \\"Politik\\".<br /><br />-The soft and sentimental chord progression of the amazing \\"The Scientist\\".<br /><br />-The recognizable and catchy theme of  \\"Clocks\\".<br /><br />-The lyrics to and overall feel of the title track.<br /><br />-And-<br /><br />-The contemplative progression of the album's closer \\"Amsterdam\\" (possibly my favorite of the whole album)--an absolutely exquisite song to close an album with.<br /><br />Upon first listen to the album's opening track, \\"Politik\\", it seems like the whole experience might be overshadowed with a tone of negativity.  But as the song progresses you actually find that what Coldplay seem to have wanted to convey is that, yes, there are frustrating things about this world but they're not going to let these things discourage them or cause them to want to give up.  This is evidenced in the second half of the song where Chris Martin just sings the same lyric over and over, \\"Give me love over this.\\"  It is as though he is choosing to take all of the things about this life that frustrate him and channel them into something that fuels love rather than hate.<br /><br />If nothing else, \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head\\" was a statement of intention that Coldplay planned on being around for a long time.  Well, here we are almost eight yearslater and in the time since then these four boys from England have delivered nothing but purely amazing music and will hopefully continue to do so well into the future.  It seems like the statement this album made has held true.  What they began with Parachutes they truly took to the next level with this album.  If I were any one of these men, looking back I would wonder to myself, \\"How did we ever successfully transition from an album like `Parachutes' to something on such a grand scale as `A Rush of Blood To the Head' without experiencing a total train wreck?\\"  At that point I guess I would just stop wondering and simply be thankful.<br /><br />A track from this album that seems to have gotten little attention is the song \\"Green Eyes\\".  I don't know why this is as it is one of my favorite tracks.  But oftentimes the real gems are hidden beneath the surface.  It's a very catchy acoustic ballad that can't help but make you think of a loved one when you hear it.  My favorite lyric from the song is, \\"I came here with a load and it feels so much lighter since I met you.\\"  And that's exactly how I've always felt every time I've come away from listening to this album--that no matter what mood I may have been in or what problems I may have been experiencing in life, my load feels just that much lighter thanks to the special place in my heart for this collection of songs.sic and will hopefully continue to do so well into the future.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|My hope would be that every person who enjoys music has a \\"heavy side\\" they can feed every once in a while.  For me, that side includes a fairly deep appreciation for the heavy metal music genre.  Within that genre, my favorite band would have to be Mastodon.  In my opinion, with regards to the year 2009, they put out the top album--\\"Crack the Skye\\".<br /><br />My inner nerd can't help but rejoice every time Mastodon releases an album.  Whether it is 2004's \\"Leviathan\\" (a concept album based on the literary classic \\"Moby Dick\\") or 2006's \\"Blood Mountain\\" (another concept album where a hero conquers Blood Mountain in search of a mythological item known as the Crystal Skull, and along the way meets various mythological creatures such as ogres and dwarves), the heavy-hitters never cease to amaze.<br /><br />And \\"amaze\\" is putting it rather lightly in terms of what Mastodon did with 2009's \\"Crack the Skye\\".  Not only do I consider this to be one of 2009's the best albums, I consider it to be one of the best albums of the last decade.<br /><br />Yet another concept album, \\"Crack the Skye\\" deals with the theme of out-of-body experiences and astral travel and the person of the Russian Czar Rasputin.<br /><br />Are these the makings of another awesome album?  Indeed.<br /><br />While drummer Brann Dailor came up with the lyrics and concept, musically, lead singer and guitarist Brent Hinds composed most of this album while recovering from a traumatic head injury sustained at the time of the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards regarding an altercation with System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian and William Hudson.  While Hinds' condition was extremely serious and he suffered from intense vertigo for months afterwards, (not to sound uncaring) if it helped him to create a masterpiece like \\"Crack the Skye\\" then it seems as though it was all worth it.<br /><br />\\"Crack the Skye\\" clocks in at just over fifty minutes yet it is only made up of seven tracks total--not exactly the average ten to twelve songs that normally make up a full-length album.  However, despite its lack of volume in terms of songs, \\"Crack the Skye\\" makes up for this by delivering track after track of solid gold heavy metal consistency.<br /><br />One track, the four-part \\"The Czar\\", clocks in at almost eleven minutes while the last track of the album (the epic \\"The Last Baron\\") clocks in at thirteen minutes.  One can argue that a length of this magnitude for one song can be a bit much.  But if you let yourself be submerged in the style changes throughout and sheer musicianship, they seem to pass as if they were mere three-minute tracks.<br /><br />Two high points for me on this album were the rip-roaring guitar riff on \\"Divinations\\" and the soaring yet extremely heavy chorus on the title track \\"Crack the Skye\\".  Both tracks adequately represent the heaviness capability of Mastodon yet equally demonstrate their melodic and musical abilities as well.<br /><br />\\"Crack the Skye\\" is a heavy album with intense subject matter yet it is very easy to swallow.  I really appreciate this band's ability to demonstrate heaviness coupled with accessibility.  I'm sure that partnering for the first time with producer Brendan O'Brien (Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, and Incubus to name a few) helped in this area.  Hopefully this will spark the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship between the band and Mr. O'Brien but Mastodon are good enough that I have faith they'll produce consistently great albums no matter which producer they end up working with.  From musicality to subject matter all the way down to album artwork, each and every Mastodon album is a real treat.e up a full-length album.

B00361HV02|3.0|With a name like \\"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\\" your band better kick butt pretty hard.  Initially, I found myself to be a bit disappointed with these guys' music as a result of the expectation I felt was set by their name.  I know that may sound silly based on the whole don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover notion, but again, with a band name like that what do you expect?  It's a great one-of-a-kind name and when I first heard it I thought to myself, \\"Oh man, these guys have got to be bad ass.\\"<br /><br />That being said, I checked out their album \\"Baby 81\\" and wasn't too impressed.  I've really tried my best to give them a second chance with \\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\" and I'm medium-glad I didn't give up based on that initial disappointment.  These guys do seem to make fairly quality music.  And after all, even though the name is probably the number one contributing factor to a band's image, is it the most important factor?<br /><br />I'll let that thought simmer in your brain.<br /><br />There is one thing I know beyond a shadow of a doubt: if I ever find myself lost in some remote bayou in Louisiana I hope to heck that I have access to \\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\", because if I do, I'll feel right at home.<br /><br />Does that seem random?  Say yes.<br /><br />I say this time and time again, but the main thing that always speaks to me with any given album is the emotion it conveys.  \\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\" just has that raw, gritty feeling that makes you feel like you want to go on an excursion somewhere down south.<br /><br />Even though I initially felt like I wasn't getting those \\"kick butt\\" moments I yearned for at first, after really delving into this album I realized that they're there, just not in the way I thought they would be.  Take the song \\"Aya\\" for instance.  It's a slow-tempo song with not much going on besides a basic drum beat and chord progression.  But the fuzzy bass guitar really gives off the feeling that this song should have been included on the soundtrack to the film \\"Black Snake Moan\\".  Also, the soaring chorus of this song definitely qualifies as a \\"kick butt\\" moment.<br /><br />At around the 3:36 mark in the song \\"Shadow's Keeper\\" we experience another one of the album's peak moments in the form of an abbreviated bass guitar solo leading into this several-minute build up of all the instruments towards the song's end--this would be awesome to witness live.<br /><br />Another high point from this album is the song \\"Sweet Feeling\\".  Nothing gets me like a well-placed harmonica.  I could listen to a singer/guitarist play solo acoustic songs all day long if they include a good harmonica every now and then (think early Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen's \\"Nebraska\\" album).  This song is a great example of good harmonica use.  I'm always of the opinion that use of a harmonica or lack thereof can make or break a song.<br /><br />I will credit the BRMC guys where it's due, they know how to end an album.  Clocking in at a whopping 10:20, the album's closing track \\"Half-State\\" is a fairly epic ride.  The length of the track alone is enough to leave you feeling tired but specifics like the pre-chorus hard rock jams make it that much better.<br /><br />Something thing that can give an album potential (and this is a weird factor cause you may never actually get this chance) is how well you feel like the songs contained would translate in a concert setting were you to see the band live.  With Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, especially with some of the songs on this album, I feel like they could put on a pretty rockin' live show.<br /><br />Overall I'd say that \\"Beat the Devil's Tattoo\\" has the potential to grow on you over time.  Parts of it are forgettable and represent garage-rock elements (\\"Conscience Killer\\") we've heard numerous times before but then again, there are parts (see above) that really stand out.  To put it quite simply, the album begins at probably its highest point with the title track and ends on a really solid note, but everything in the middle--while there are good moments--seems like kind of a blur.<br /><br />While listening to this album I've realized that it's possible for it to take months or even years for an album to grow on you to the point of you considering it a classic.  I'm not saying that I consider this album to be a classic by any means (it's definitely enjoyable) but who knows where my consideration of it could end up several months or even years down the road.  It's good enough to where it could stick for a while.  But can it really stand the test of time?<br /><br />While Black Rebel Motorcycle Club display good efforts time and time again, I'm leaning towards no.ts--seems like kind of a blur.

0471267554|3.0|About the book: It is quite the dry, boring read. The author keeps repeating his \\"facts\\" without much substantial evidence. I would have liked it to have gotten to the point quicker, or left some of the theorizing for later chapters. I am not a big fan of the theorizing at all (there are some many diets, I can't really tell which ones are sound) but if you have it, please be concise and be solid. Which this isn't, there is no real proof what people ate 500 generations ago was really good for them.<br /><br />The diet: A diet distinguishes yourself in how much work it is, how realistic/likely it is to stick with it long term, how effective it is, and how much leeway it has for your cravings and comfort foods. Paleo worked for me, big plus. It does not hold up so well in the practicality department: Out at the restaurant there isn't much you can eat. If you stick with all the rules, no salt no yeast no grains, this is very restrictive and chances of long term success are lowered. Giving different levels with 1-3 open meals per week is smart and is a rule every diet should have. You have to shop and cook a lot for this diet, but that's the case for most. No calorie counting is a bonus (no weighing etc.). Nuts are allowed which helps in the cravings and snacks dept.<br /><br />Overall there are great things to be learned here. Long term I will probably stick with Volumetrics or South Beach.
0061914177|5.0|I read \\"Crush It\\" just before the holidays 2009.  It is a quick read, and I went through it quickly the first time mostly because I couldn't put it down. It was a fascinating, insightful, conversational read on the very hot \\"social media\\" topic. With my background as an editor, I am inclined to put sticky notes on pages and use a lot of highlighting, and the second time I read this book I did just that.  I then went to my computer and went to various sections as I worked on my own branding. I found it very helpful, easy to follow, a perfect read for all levels of social media expertise and a book that definitely has pertinent info that will help you and your company make the most of your brand. It is a book I have gone back to again and again. It is timely, it is helpful, and it is a book I highly recommend regularly. Thank you, Gary.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I watch two episodes of this on the Discovery Channel.  I won't say anything about Oprah Winfrey's performance, but the narrative and sound track on this were both appalling.  This led me to cancel my order for the BBC version, until I can be assured that 1) The soundtrack improves the quality of the production, and 2) The narrative has some new meaning.  What I saw in terms of content was, like, nothing new!  This gives me more reservations about the BBC version.  I mean, we have seen the Lammergeier go after bones before, right?  In the Attenborough productions in the past, I have generally seen a lot of things that were new, that had never been filmed before, or at least viewed from the perspective that was presented.  I'm not sure that there is much that is new here.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|OMG. I was lucky enough to see this work unveiled to the world last night live NYC. True to her style/taste, she performed in a very intimate venue, an old Church converted to a music hall/theater. It only sits 892 people, and I can tell you it was an absolutely amazing experience to not only hear her perform her new work live, but be able to hear her explain the ideology behind it all, her motives, stories about the poets she chose to use and their prose.<br /><br />The work on this album took took her almost 5 years to put together from initial thought to final recording - it is technically a \\"concept\\" album of sorts I suppose. When you buy this album PLEASE keep this in mind - it is *not* your atypical Natalie album. But that does not mean its not your atypical Natalie quality. Natalie wrote all the music on this double album, but wrote it to prose of various poets from different time periods, genres, and places around the world. What's neat is that you can hear how each individual poem \\"influenced\\" her based on the music she wrote around it.<br /><br />Despite this not being a typical rock album, it is something you most certainly want to have in your collection. She used over 100 musicians to create this album, and as always, the music she wrote is flawless, beautiful & timeless. I admit that it's \\"hard\\" to hear Natalie sing words that are not her own, as she is such an amazing lyricist in her own right. Which is why I'm glad I had the opportunity to hear this for the first time live, by her.<br /><br />The music is inspirational, moving, sardonic, melancholy-ish, uplifting; the melodies will make you smile, cry, introspect, & day dream - song by song each is it's own journey. Once you get acclimated to this not being an atypical Natalie release, you will find yourself falling in love with this work - it truly comes from the heart & soul of a phenomenal artist who simply shines above almost all else. Her voice is as strong & beautiful as ever, her musical compositions flawless, her effort & time put into this project clearly evident. It is a masterpiece.effort & time put into this project clearly evident. It is a masterpiece.

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I had seen \\"Gran Torino\\" when it first came out in theaters: however, I took a second look at this film when it came to DVD, because my initial impression kept haunting me.  I have to say that I liked this movie very much.  I liked the story, a lost young man looking for his place in the world finding a mentor in the most unlikely of characters.  Filmed on location in Michigan, Clint Eastwood, directed and stars as a crusty widower, Korean vet, detached from his adult children and their family's, living out his days in a neighborhood settled mostly by Hmong people.  Newcomers to the screen are fledging actors, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, plus an appearance by Clint's son, Scott Eastwood has the small part of Trey (as Scott Reeves).  This movie is about change and values, about knowing who you are, and who you want to be.<br /><br />Walt uses just about every racist term he can think of in this film.  His new neighbors consist of an Asian family consisting of a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's two children, Sue and Thao.  One characteristic between Americans and just about any other race is the matter of family.  Walter Kowalski, his two sons, moved out long ago, rarely visit, sits alone on his porch all day drinking beer and eating beef jerky.  On the other hand, his Asian neighbors have family and friends constantly visiting, bringing food and having family celebrations.  The movie focuses on Thao and his sister Sue as second-generation immigrants trying to find a niche in this country.  Thao, around 16, living in a female dominated household, content to read and garden, activities considered in Asian society as woman's work, is visibly lost.  His sister Sue, a few years older, describes their environment concisely, \\"the women go to college the boys, go to jail.\\"  Matters worsen for Thao when his cousin, Spider approaches him to join his gang and receive protection from the other gangs.  The initiation to join the gang is to steal his neighbor, Walt's 1972 Gran Torino.  Thao botches the auto theft and runs home.  Too dark to see who was trying to steal his prize, Walt is unaware that it is his own neighbor, Thao.  The next evening, Spider and his gang come to give Thao another chance, but the boy's sister, mother, and grandmother interfere.  Spiders, gang of dropouts try to take Thao forcibly.  In the midst of the ruckus, Walt, armed with his army issue M1 Garand comes out Dirty Harry style and saves the day.  As the reluctant hero to the Hmong community, his neighbors shower him with gifts of flowers and food, arriving on his porch daily.  Sue, her mother, and Thao insist that Thao repays Walt for trying to steal his car by working for him.  Reluctantly, as Walt does not want anything to do with these people, agrees to the work arrangement and the two of them begin a journey together that make this an excellent movie.  The other character to watch for is Thao's sister Sue, although a stronger, smarter character than her brother, she too is a victim of her environment.<br /><br />Right away, the acting of two supporting characters will come in question.  I say the supporting cast played their parts strong, and added a depth to the story, the human element.  Bee Vang's portrayal of Thao at times seems awkward, out of place and lost.  Teenaged boys, growing up without a strong male role model, are awkward, out of place and are certainly lost.  Bee Vang is a natural for this part.<br /><br />Like the Dirty Harry movies, the Spaghetti westerns of Eastwood's early films, or even Pale Rider, or \\"the Unforgiven,\\" this movie stands out for the journey that each of the character make toward finding themselves.  Walt, Thao, Sue, Sue's grandmother, Father Janovich, and even Spider and his gang.  Each of the characters, making this journey of self discovery ties together throughout the movie by one thing, Walter Kowalski's 1972 Gran Torino.  The 1972 Gran Torino that Walt installed the steering column as it rolled out of the factory.  The Gran Torino that Thao attempted to steal, the Gran Torino that is the envy of the town, the Gran Torino that Walt's inconsiderate granddaughter asks for when he dies.  The Gran Torino that Thao must wash as part of his penitence, the Gran Torino that Walt allowed Thao drives his first date to the prom.  In the reading of Walt's Last Will & Testament, the Gran Torino does not go to his granddaughter, Ashley, who is an insensitive brat.  Instead, Walt gives the Gran Torino to Thao.  The Gran Torino gives Thao the opportunity for a new life.  The car, like Walt is an antique, a reminder of the past.<br /><br />I wanted my kids to see this movie in spite of the swearing and racial slurs.that Thao attempted to steal, the Gran Torino that is the envy of the town, the Gran Torino that Walt's inconsiderate granddaughter asks for when he dies.

B0038KHTI0|5.0|(This review is for the 2CD 'Box Set' edition of The Wicked Symphony & Angel Of Babylon)  Avantasia is a project composed and put together by vocalist Tobias Sammet of Edguy. The first Avantasia releases were the 'The Metal Opera' parts 1 and 2. Both records are regarded as some of the best, modern power metal albums and feature famous guests such as Michael Kiske, Kai Hansen and Timo Tolkki. The project was revived in 2008 with the release of the album 'The Scarecrow'. The album featured famous guests such as Alice Cooper, Jorn Lande and Rudolf Schenker, among others and the music leaned more towards hard rock rather than power metal. The Scarecrow was amongst the 20 best selling albums in Europe upon it's release.  On April 3, 2010, Tobias Sammet released The Scarecrow's sequel, as a double album named &#34;The Wicked Symphony & Angel Of Babylon&#34; or as two separate disks. The main musicians remain the same, with Tobias Sammet on bass and lead vocals, Sascha Paeth (ex-Heaven's Gate) on guitars and Eric Singer (Kiss) on drums.  The cast of guest vocalists includes some of the biggest names in rock and metal! Klaus Meine (Scorpions), Tim Owens (ex-Judas Priest, ex-Iced Earth), Jon Oliva (Savatage, Jon Oliva's Pain), Jorn Lande (ex-Ark, Masterplan), Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Place Vendome), Russell Allen (Symphony X), Bob Catley (Magnum), Andre Matos (ex-Angra, Shaaman), Cloudy Yang and Ralf Zdiarstek.  Guest musicians include guitarists Bruce Kulick (ex-Kiss, ex-Meat Loaf) and Oliver Hartmann (ex-At Vance), keyboardist Jens Johansson (Stratovarius) and both Alex Holzwarth (Rhapsody) and Felix Bohnke (Edguy) on drums.  Both The Wicked Symphony and Angel Of Babylon are outstanding albums. They offer plenty of musical variety and especially The Wicked Symphony can be regarded as the best Avantasia release up to today. As in the prequel, the music focuses more on hard rock with bombastic choruses and great guitar melodies. Nevertheless, there are at least three fast paced power metal tracks, several heavy metal pieces, some ballads and a few progressive touches scattered throughout the two albums. Additionally, some symphonic passages, big choirs and several extended guitar battles add further colors to the music.  Most of the songs manage to stand out and only a few fall short.  &#34;The Wicked Symphony&#34; is one of the longest tracks on offer and probably one of the most varied peaces on the albums. It begins with a slow symphonic intro, which is soon joined by a section of hard rock riffs. The verses are powered by a vocal battle between Sammet, Russell Allen and Jorn Lande. The chorus features choirs and is catchy and huge. There are several tempo changes, symphonic parts and a long guitar solo. The title track is one of the best songs on offer and both Allen and Lande give outstanding performances.  The single &#34;Dying For An Angel&#34;, features Klaus Meine on vocals and is probably the most catchy and accessible rocker. The song features nice balladry vocals on the mellow verses and a big melodic rock chorus, with Meine's vocals harkening back to the Scorpions.  &#34;Wastelands&#34; is one of the strongest songs on both albums, even though it is a somewhat typical power metal tune. It begins with a majestic intro (similar to Helloween's March Of Time) and soon kicks into fast double bass speed with the addition of a melodic guitar solo. Michael Kiske hits some higher notes on the verses and soars to the heaven's on the epic chorus. This is probably Kiske's best vocal performance on a fast power metal song since the 90's. Tobias takes the lead for the second verse and chorus and an extended exchange of guitar solos between Oliver Hartmann and Sascha Paeth follows.  &#34;Stargazers&#34; is the second longest song after The Wicked Symphony and features vocals by Tobias Sammet, Jorn Lande, Michael Kiske, Russell Allen and a brief performance by Oliver Hartmann. On guitars we have Bruce Kulick and Sascha Paeth. The song begins with a ballad type intro and explodes into fast paced double bass tempo, heading for the bridge and chorus. Half way to the song the music switches to a slow lead guitar passage, changes into faster speed again for an impressive guitar battle and drops to a mid-tempo hard rock mode, continuing in that vein until the end. Stargazers contains a memorable power metal chorus, good vocal transitions, impressive solos, tempo changes and both Michael Kiske and Jorn Lande in top form. Definitely one of the best songs here.  &#34;Death Is Just A Feeling&#34; featuring Jon Oliva is the most theatrical song. It begins in a slow tempo and gets heavier in the pre-chorus. Oliva sings in an eerie way, reminding of Alice Cooper on The Toy Master, while the verses provide a creepy atmosphere. The chorus is bombastic, addictive and very fitting for Oliva's voice.  &#34;Runaway Train&#34; is another long song, which can be best described as something between a ballad and a Meat Loaf type of slow rocker. The vocals are shared between Bob Catley, Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande, while Michael Kiske sings a small part towards the end. The chorus of the song is memorable and bombastic, a mid-tempo Magnum like rock passage is included and the guitar solos throughout the track are outstanding. The voices of the different singers work very well together.  &#34;Promised Land&#34; is an up-tempo hard rock/melodic metal song, with a very powerful chorus, an enjoyable guitar solo and a fine vocal performance by Jorn Lande. Promised Land is another sure highlight.  &#34;Scales Of Justice&#34; features an aggressive Tim 'Ripper' Owens on vocals and is one of the heavier tracks on both albums. The song contains heavy riffing and a good chorus, but suffers from similarities to Iced Earth and a strange Queen-like passage instead of a guitar solo. Nevertheless, a song to check out especially if you enjoy Tim's vocals.  &#34;Your Love Is Evil&#34; is a simple, but catchy rock track. It has a lateEdguy feel, a pleasing chorus and a memorable vocal performance by Sammet.  &#34;States Of Matter&#34; is another enjoyable mid-tempo hard rock song. Strong guitar riffs, great vocals by Russell Allen and Sammet, a memorable chorus and a fitting guitar solo round of the track perfectly.  &#34;Symphony Of Life&#34; is a very nice mid tempo gothic/metal song. The track is sang by the female vocalist Cloudy Yang and features symphonic backings, choirs and a very good chorus. While memorable, Symphony Of Life, sounds very out of place on the album.  &#34;Journey To Arcadia&#34; is another theatrical highlight, with great melodies and Bob Catley's strongest vocal performance on the new albums. Nice vocal transitions between Sammet and Allen and a good chorus. All in all a good closing track, nothing more and nothing less.  The remaining songs are quality offerings as well, but not to the extend of the aforementioned tracks.  Fortunately, there are no big disadvantages on this release. One of the major drawbacks of previous Avantasia releases was the fact that Sammet got the lion's share of the vocals. Thankfully Sammet's appearance is minimal on the tunes were the big names like Oliva, Maine and Owens sing, while the longer tracks are vocally more well balanced. One negative point is the fact that although this was supposed to be a concept album, the songs don't flow perfectly together in order to create continuity. Another disadvantage is the inclusion of many mid-tempo and slower rock songs (especially on Angel Of Babylon) and not enough heavier or faster tracks, to perfectly balance the release. One can also argue that with the exclusion of Jorn Lande, the guest vocalists don't get to sing on more than one or two songs.  If listened as a single release and not as two separate albums, &#34;The Wicked Symphony & Angel Of Babylon&#34; probably surpasses both The Scarecrow and The Metal Opera's. Surely some older, classic Avantasia songs like The Seven Angels, Farewell,The Tower and The Scarecrow are not topped here, but the new release is stronger as a whole.  If judged as two separate releases, The Wicked Symphony is surely the better album, as it contains stronger songs and a larger number of guest vocalists. Angel Of Babylon falls a little short due to some weaker songs.  Tobias Sammet should be congratulated for creating this impressive rock opera and for being one of the best modern day songwriters, in both rock and metal.  (The Box Set edition features the 2 albums in digibook cases and a booklet containing an extensive interview, a biography and numerous photos)o for Dying For An Angel).

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete is Square-Enix's replacement for the original one that was released in 2005.  Not only do the additional 30 minutes elaborate on some questionable plot devices, but resequenced scenes assist with this, as well.  The story is still the movie's weakest point with the character portrayals (Cloud especially) being quite different than that of the 1997 game's.  Only the fanbase would recognize this deviation, but even those new to the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII still need help from veterans in order to understand some moments in the movie.  With that being said, the story Nomura was trying to achieve was not actually bad.  Playing off of the protagonist's past and guilt made him made the film revolve mostly on him.  Many fans were upset that Advent Children did not give more camera time to other cast members, but this is a movie that focused on developing Cloud Strife's character.  The aftermath of Final Fantasy VII's ending was something fans wanted to see, and Nomura did a nice job portraying the citizens of Edge coping with building a new life and the geostigma epidemic.  The remnants of Sephiroth (the villain) continue to haunt the people and it is up to Cloud to rise and combat this new/old threat.  Not exactly the most mind-blowing plot, but it works for a spin-off movie.    Being a blu-ray film, the quality of the video is stunning.  Square-Enix has obviously invested a lot of time converting the original into this high definition format, as well as re-doing and adding scenes into the mix.  The image is incredibly sharp and the audience is able to notice the fine details of leather, fabric, and skin pores.  One of the things that Nomura intended for this film was to make it more mature (i.e.- addition of blood and dirt).  He succeeded by tastefully adding dirt, grime, and bruises in every fight scene which created a sense of realism.  Blood was not added much until the final confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist.  The fight scenes were still stunning and the added footage made them even more epic than before.  Those who have watched the original movie should easily notice the differences in limit break animations (color and design).  Small details such as the effect of Cloud Strife's usage of the limit break Braver on the Bahamut summon add to the enjoyability of these scenes.    The music should be easily recognizable for fans of Final Fantasy VII.  Since the company has upgraded from using MIDI files for the soundtrack, each song has a certain twist to it.  The enemy battle theme is now played by a piano and may be heard during Tifa's encounter with Loz.  Aerith's theme was also redone using a piano and may be heard in each time she appears.  The boss battle theme has a rock n' roll taste to it, being redone with heavy guitar riffs which makes it the most difficult to recognize upon first time viewing.  One of the more popular themes, One Winged Angel, is instantly recognizable but has vocals, guitars, and drums.  It sounds very similar to some of the works by trailer music companies.  There are some original tracks such as the one used in the battle of the Forgotten City and J.E.N.O.V.A. and those also have a neat design to them.    Overall, this movie is a must buy for fans of the original Final Fantasy VII game.  Some may be disappointed by the change in Cloud's personality, and others may not like the lack of screen time that the original supporting characters receive.  The action is pretty much universally loved by the audience, even when seeming to be over the top sometimes.  It's a Final Fantasy product, though, so it isn't very hard to suspend one's belief in order to enjoy the defiance of physics.  The story continues the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, so if the gamer wants to broaden his/her experience in this particular universe, then this blu-ray does the job well.  It is good to experience these characters in a realistic illustration and the wonderful CGI almost seems to bring them to life for the fans.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|\\"World War Z\\" to me was an experience. A book that turned out very differently than I expected, and a book the held a fascinating spell over me. \\"World War Z\\" is the perfect example to show that it is equally important how you tell a story, as the story itself.<br /><br />It is clearly a product of the Internet society of today, the way the book strings together unrelated snippets of tidbits and information to create a bigger picture. It is how we pretty much gather our own information every day. A bit here, a bit there - and all of it with a strong personal bias.<br /><br />The result is a book that has a unique documentary feel. There is no protagonist. There is no story to speak of, just a chronologically organized, anecdotal recollection of a fictional war that brought mankind to the brink of extinction and back again. It makes you feel as if the events could really have happened, giving the book an incredible realism despite its far-fetched, horrific premise.<br /><br />The way Brooks presents each little snippet worked perfectly for me - each person with their own distinct voice. While we have no backstory for these characters, it is easy to connect with each of them within a few sentences. To me that is the real genius of the book, the ability to connect and create tangible personalities in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is not a book for everyone, clearly, but if you're looking for something outside the box of traditional plot-driven horror fiction, this is the book for you!

0812973992|4.0|This is a great book about a city.  McCann shows us so many of its characters, and he weaves their lives, their heartbreak, their happiness into a single narrative about a place and a people.  The main thread of the story is the tight-roping incident, and it works well to hold the book together.  I loved the main narratives of the two Irish brothers and mother-daughter pair, but the minor characters intrigued me just as much: the tagger, the judge, the computer programmers.  How do you tell the story of a whole city, an entire country, in one book?  Colum McCann comes pretty close.
0810988232|5.0|When you enter the world of Faerie you enter another world, a world of magic and love that is opened to you through your imagination and is guided by the wisdom and beauty of faeries. Each faerie encountered along the way is a unique being fully thought-out with their own personalities and intriguing quirks. Each faerie encountered is there to guide you on your way.<br /><br />But the world of Faerie is not at all times giggles and sunshine; there is a deep and complex side to Faerie that is not always easily navigated. However, through each individual faerie and their corresponding card you will find a meaning for each faerie that appears to you on your journey into their magical world.<br /><br />Each card in the set offers an image that tells its own story as it draws you in, a story that is interpreted and added to by the reader. There are many familiar faces that have returned once again to share their knowledge, but there are also many new faces who have for the first time presented themselves in this charming set.<br /><br />The Heart of Faerie Oracle showcases the masterful and stunningly beautiful artwork of Brian Froud in such a way as to involve the reader in the enchanting story as narrated by the faeries through Wendy Froud. This is officially the first work the couple have collaborated on together and an interview with Brian and Wendy Froud about this is included.<br /><br />There is something about Brian Froud's art that is both inspiring and emotional, a raw beauty that looks deep inside and captures the very heart of a thing. That same essence is captured here in this set. My first reading with these lovely cards was using the three wishes reading, more about that and the faeries meanings can be found inside The Heart of Faerie Oracle.
B003405MF6|5.0|Just an amazingly crafted grouping of songs. Steve Lipson does a fabulous job of producing this man who is so gifted at making an electric guitar sing. The sound of this CD is so spacial. It's so hard to pick a favorite tune, because his instrumentals are brilliant, and the songs he has guests on are well picked, and very well sung. Lilac Wine just floored me. Imelda May has a beautiful voice. \\"There's No Other Me\\", with Joss Stone on vocals, just kills. Interpretations of Over the Rainbow and Nessun Dorma, are shining examples of Jeff's ability to take a vocal melody, play it on guitar, and not lose a thing in the process other than the words. Hammerhead just smokes.    So glad I purchased this. It's an instant classic from a true legend.

0316044695|5.0|Amazing story, just amazing.  I personally feel that every high school student in the US should read this book to get a flavor of the price that is paid to gain and keep the freedoms we all enjoy.  Young men have been paying this price for hundreds of years, right up to today.  It's one thing to understand this on a conceptual/intellectual level, but it's a whole different ballgame when you read an amazing story like this.  You're right there with the guys through the unbelievable training to the ugly battlefield.  After reading this book you \\"get it\\" on a whole different level.  It's personal and real.  We will never be able to repay the debt that is owed to those serving and those who have served in the armed forces.  On top of all of this, it's a riveting story that you can't put down.  It's just an incredibly compelling read.  If this were fiction you would discount the story as being unrealistic, not believable.      Some have criticized the writing and I think they're missing the point.  This is a SEAL telling his story.  The style of the book is kind of like a transcript of an oral account of his story.  It's as if Marcus were sitting on your couch and telling you everything that happened in his own voice, using his own words, style and language.  It doesn't take away from the story; it adds to the story.  This was not meant to be a great piece of \\"writing\\" with brilliantly constructed sentences, deep insights, analysis, research, etc.  It's a guy telling his story in his own voice and it's 100% perfect for this particular book, in my opinion.  While the subject matter is totally unrelated, if you want great non-fiction writing read someting like  Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. by Ron Chernow.  That's what absolute first class non-fiction writing looks like.  But comparing that type of work to this book is like comparing apples and oranges, which some people are, more or less, trying to do with comments like \\"there are great warriors and great writers, but few great warrior-writers\\".  \\"Great writing\\" is not the objective here.  The story stands on its own and, in my opinion, is best told in this \\"oral\\" style for this particular story.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|I really wanted to see this movie. I've been a long time Tarantino fan. Unfortunately the disc wouldn't play. It wasn't system incompatibility but product defect. The main menu loop ran fine as did the main titles of the movie with the studio and production company, but then it never goes beyond. Screen goes black and nothing more occurs. Returned for exchange and second copy of the product failed to function in exactly the same manner. This was the Blu-Ray version. I've not attempted with a straight DVD--maybe in a year or two.

0307389839|3.0|I hate to say it, but this is probably the worst thing I've read by Murakami.<br /><br />On paper--or rather, on the back of the paperback--it sounded like a sure thing; I'm a writer, and I've got a few marathons under my belt, and I was spellbound by the three other books I've read of his. So I thought I'd hit the trifecta when I pulled this off the shelf (at Border's--sorry, Amazon!) and saw that he'd written about writing and running.<br /><br />And by and large, I felt a rush of excitement in the early chapters, a sensation not unlike the fresh lively feeling one gets at the start of a marathon, when the exhilaration far outweighs the effort that's been expended. It's fascinating, for instance, to read that he'd been the owner of a small jazz nightclub and hadn't had any particular ambitions to be a writer until he was in his 30s. I couldn't identify with that, but I could relate to his persistent attitude about writing. There's a romanticized notion of writers living the bad life, drinking and smoking and doing their best to churn out a great manuscript or two before their hard living catches up with them. (I've lived that life, but in my experience it doesn't necessarily make one a better writer, unless one's writing about what it feels like to drink and smoke, and that eventually makes for boring reading. This \\"But-Hemingway-did-it!\\" attitude often eventually becomes just an extra excuse to drink and smoke. Anyway, I digress.) It turns out that the lessons of physical fitness--persistence, mental toughness, goal-setting--can be far more useful and applicable to writing, a lesson Murakami and I have both apparently learned.<br /><br />But those insights are, by and large, done by the midway point, and what remains is a long and boring slog. I've heard that a writer should never confuse how they feel about a story with how good the story actually is, and Murakami would have done well to heed this advice; his training efforts and race times were obviously near and dear and dear to his heart, but they make for rather unexciting reading. Also, his observations and analyses often come off as flat and uninspired; as an author, he's great at conjuring up memorably fantastic scenarios that still seem real, characters that feel full, and plots that work like a Swiss watch, but without the ability to make things up and take them in unexpected directions, he's reduced to stating banalities like \\"Nobody's going to win all the time. On the highway of life you can't always be in the fast lane.\\"<br /><br />To be fair, I'm possibly a little jealous. Murakami's enough of an established author that he could probably print out, say, every email he's sent in the last ten years, staple them together and call them a book, and sell a kajillion copies, whereas some of us are still toiling away in obscurity, unable to sell manuscripts over which we've slaved for years. But it seems even Murakami has the sense that this is a substandard work. After describing a disappointing performance at the Boston Marathon, he says, \\"This may be a sort of conclusion. An understated, rainy-day sneakers sort of conclusion. An anticlimax, if you will. Turn it into a screenplay, and the Hollywood producer would just glance at the last page and toss it back.\\" Elsewhere, he mentions reworking the manuscript many times; while some amount of revision is obviously necessary, too much ends up leaving the writer with no sense of perspective on whether or not the work's any good. Like a jogger slogging towards the finish line, one ends up thinking about just getting the damn thing done with and resting for a while.<br /><br />In lieu of this, I'd suggest getting Ann Lamott's \\"Bird by Bird,\\" which doesn't have any fitness tips but is perhaps the best book I've ever read about writing. But if your desire to read is as automatic as Murakami's desire to run, you may end up picking this up anyway. And if you're anything like me you may end up turning the final page wearily, muttering the tired marathoner's frequent post-race lament: \\"Never again.\\"post-race lament: \\"Never again.\\"

B000002TQB|5.0|It's astonishing that Parklife ever became popular. It's so full of rough edges: even the dance-inspired hit single \\"Girls And Boys\\" is aggressively dissonant. The chugging beat isn't really danceable, the production is full of squealing, squawking noises, and Albarn sings in an overbearing, tuneless holler. It's an even unlikelier hit single than [[ASIN:B0000E6XJQ Underworld's]] \\"Born Slippy NUXX.\\"<br /><br />A lot of the album is like this. After showing his versatility on [[ASIN:B000002USH Modern Life Is Rubbish]], Graham Coxon came into his own and developed a scraping guitar sound that always sounds slightly off-key, even when the song is bright and good-natured. Check out the riff that leads in \\"Tracy Jacks,\\" and the odd inversion of that riff at the end. The song has an airy feel, but the guitar is a little heavier than the tone requires. Same with \\"Trouble In The Message Centre,\\" which affects a [[ASIN:B00008BRB5 Police]]-ish new-wave sound, but with an overly heavy and distorted lead guitar.<br /><br />Moreover, the album is deliberately loosely structured. The first side has a gratuitous instrumental (\\"The Debt Collector,\\" a straightforward 3/4 bit on drunken horns) and a completely pointless two-minute sketch (\\"Far Out\\") in which bassist Alex James recites the names of various stars. The second side has an even more pointless instrumental (\\"Lot 105,\\" which sounds like goofy carnival music and really kills the majestic atmosphere left after \\"This Is A Low\\") and a couple of songs (\\"Clover Over Dover\\" and \\"Magic America\\") that are way too cute for their own good. The rhymes in \\"Clover Over Dover\\" are actually lazy enough to reuse \\"clover,\\" \\"over\\" and \\"Dover\\" in every verse.<br /><br />So, Parklife is not a very accessible album. Or is it? Coxon's guitar may be dissonant, but he still writes brilliant hooks. Furthermore, repeated listening reveals that the songwriting is much more complex and subtle than it first seems. \\"Badhead\\" opens with a five-note horn fanfare, which is then woven into the chorus in a peculiar way. Instead of forming the main rhythm of the song (as the lead melody typically might), it sort of accentuates parts of the lyrics in the chorus. The aforementioned \\"Clover Over Dover\\" may be silly and precious, but only until you hear the way in which the sparkling, iridescent keyboards combine with the guitar line and the \\"ah-ah\\" refrain in the background. The sweet spot in \\"End Of A Century\\" is the sighs in between the lyrics in the chorus.<br /><br />Parklife already contains most of the tricks that Damon Albarn relied on throughout his career: a monologue by an actor (Parklife's title track is a precursor to \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\" by [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Gorillaz]]), a quick punk thrash (\\"Bank Holiday\\" is clearly a proto-\\"[[ASIN:B000000WDA Song 2]]\\"), melancholy string-drenched ballads (compare \\"This Is A Low\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0035G9ABQ On Melancholy Hill]]\\"), and constant stylistic jumps. Albarn and Coxon are consummate actors on this album -- Coxon can effortlessly switch between hardcore punk (\\"Bank Holiday\\"), laddish pub-rock (\\"Parklife\\") and gorgeous French-film pop (\\"To The End\\"), while Albarn uses these backdrops to spin witty stories criticizing modern life and expressing theatrical sadness. They're so good that they can twist and innovate on the styles they're imitating in the very process of imitating them.<br /><br />To see what brilliant impersonators they are, all you need is \\"London Loves,\\" which steals [[ASIN:B000002AWR Suede]]'s decadent city-glamour theatrics (\\"London loves the way people just fall apart\\" is the best line Brett Anderson never wrote) and improves on them to the point of rendering Suede irrelevant. The sentiment of the song is pure Suede (as is Albarn's falsetto on \\"London loves\\" in the chorus), but the music is an electro-guitar grind with a bizarre two-part guitar line, the first part sounding like an over-compressed electric jangle, and the second sounding like some kind of weird finger-picked flourish. Halfway through, there's a break with an \\"aw[...]\\" stolen from techno music (Underworld's \\"Bigmouth\\" has a break just like this). No other Britpop song sounds anything like this. It is vastly more original than Suede's straightforward Bowie/Smiths kick.<br /><br />Albarn's lyrics are much more pointed and clever than on Modern Life Is Rubbish. \\"Girls And Boys\\" is the only song that could ever contend for the title of the British \\"[[ASIN:B000003TA4 Smells Like Teen Spirit]].\\" It's just that the bouncy rhythm masks how vicious Albarn's take on hedonistic youth culture really is, with the chorus of \\"looking for girls who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys,\\" and a short pause before the killer punchline, \\"always should be someone you really love.\\"<br /><br />But it's not all about venom and social commentary. This may be why I often find myself preferring Parklife to Blur's 1995 followup [[ASIN:B000000WA2 The Great Escape]]. The 1995 album is superior in almost every way, with even better and more creative music, but for some reason, it feels less emotionally vulnerable to me, more concerned with witty early-[[ASIN:0679603174 Chekhov]]-style anecdotes pointing out the alleged boorishness and mediocrity of the middle class. Parklife, despite the purposefully shambolic sequencing and the abundance of questionable detours, has beautiful laments like \\"End Of A Century,\\" \\"To The End\\" (what line is more rueful than \\"you and I collapsed in love?\\") and \\"This Is A Low.\\" Other songs like \\"Tracy Jacks\\" are a bit self-important -- you can tell that the writer is very young when he concludes that the main character is \\"over\\" once he is \\"getting past forty\\" -- but still compassionate.<br /><br />It all adds up to Albarn's first masterpiece. Parklife still sounds surprisingly fresh and vibrant, simply because the composition is so detailed and subtle. No new British band overthe past ten years has anything approaching Coxon's skill on the guitar or Albarn's flair for the dramatic. A classic in the best sense.

This 12 track , Milan version is easy to get and enjoy , here at Amazon . But after reading some of these reviews , it may sound like the varese 16 track version is hard to find and pricy .

Saw is either my first or second favorite horror movie of all time.(competing with the Halloween franchise)   Saw is a very entertaing yet very disturbing movie. Unpredictable to the very end. I could not beleive the ending! It defently makes me want to run to the movie store and rent Saw 2!    Another thing that makes \\"Saw\\" a fantastic movie is the music. Whenever the \\"Saw Theme\\" would play, my heart would speed up.     If you are a fan of Horror movies you will love this film !

B0002234LS|3.0|\\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\". This is the name of the book written by Stephen King. This is what the movie Secret Window is based on. What makes Secret Window so good is that the casting was very good. Johnny Depp leads the way with an great performance. Without Depp this movie would not be as good.  Overall if you like suspense/thriller movies Secret Window is worth your time.
1592402690|5.0|At the very end of the Gospel of John, the Evangelist remarks that Jesus did many other things than what the Bible tells and that if every one of them were written down the whole world could not have room for all the books that could be written.  Of course, The Beatles cannot be compared to the timeless influence of the Messiah; but, for their time and likely a long time after, they were earthshaking and (not the least) much beloved.<br /><br />There has been a steady, growing library of books about The Beatles.  Some are by people who knew them intimately and were witnesses to actual events.  Others may tell The Beatles story second or third hand.  Still others write specifically about the music itself with some focusing on the specific musical instruments each Beatle used on this and that recording.  As with anything, some Beatle books are good and some are god-awful.  Some books are openly hostile and disparaging to the music and The Beatles themselves as people.  All this requires some tempering.<br /><br />As great and endearing each of the Beatles were, each in their time could be complete jerks.  They also could be open and generous to a fault.  It is obvious they had no business sense in their early days and especially with the establishment of Apple.  For those who loved them and took as inspiration The Beatle's proclamation of \\"peace and love\\", the final dissolution and acrimony amongst the band was heartbreaking--somewhat similar to breaking faith.  Yet they left us with music that did change the world, launched thousands of bands, spawned a fantastic age of musical creativity in their wake, and continue to awaken new fans each and every day.  John, Paul, George and Ringo themselves will eventually fade from popular memory; but the music...yes, the music will be loved.<br /><br />This is Emerick's personal memoir and so we see the Beatles through his eyes and ears for events he actually witnessed--very little that he did not see for himself.  Some may dislike the degree Emierick puts himself into the narrative and his modest claims to contributing some innovations to the sound of particular Beatle tracks; but it is interesting how little of Emerick's actual personal life makes it into the book.<br /><br />As Emerick began his career in record engineering, he literally had just left school and was walked to the EMI offices by his father for his first job interview.  Knowing absolutely nothing about the craft, he is taken in under George Martin's wing and met the Beatles very early in their recording career.<br /><br />Of the individual Beatles themselves, Emerick's account is off balance and in many ways leaves some questions unanswered.  Emerick clearly liked John quite a bit.  At the same time, it was difficult to know which John you were going to get.  By the time Emerick met him, John had entered a placid, easygoing stage in his life--somewhat by John's personal temperament and later most likely under the influence of marijuana and LSD.  Nonassertive and at times almost childlike, John was quite content to let McCartney take the band's reins.  Nevertheless, this time was the most creative in Lennon's life.<br /><br />Oddly, Lennon didn't like his own voice.  Emerick spent a great deal of time modifying Lennon's recorded voice to satisfy him.  (This is why many listeners had difficulty telling who was singing on some Lennon recordings.)  Lennon, like the other Beatles, constantly and naively pressed the limits of recording technology and musical instruments themselves.  Often he (they) would leave staff objections behind by remarking \\"don't worry--you'll find a way\\".  Lennon would come up with odd ideas such as being hung upside and singing while spinning around the microphone.  Fortunately, Lennon forgot all about it after those in the studio deliberately stalled with other matters for an hour.<br /><br />Lennon's laid-back demeanor changed around to time of the appearance of Yoko Ono and the recording sessions for what would turn out to be the WHITE ALBUM.  Lennon turned intolerant, abrasive and unpleasant.  Arguments among the Beatles were common at all stages the band's existence; but the frequency and bitterness increased sharply during the WHITE ALBUM sessions.  Emerick himself is not inclined to attribute this change to Yoko Ono herself but rather upon Lennon's addiction to heroin.  One is naturally curious what the other Beatles thought and said to Lennon about his enthusiasm for the corrosive narcotic; but Emertick leaves to question unanswered.  What is more, if it was Yoko Ono who introduced Lennon to heroin (which is likely), she bears far more responsibility for the bitter disunity among the band members than Emerick is willing to concede.  When all is said and done, Emerick loved Lennon.  I think, however, it would be fair to say Emerick's relationship with Lennon was a little distant compared to the one he shared with McCartney.<br /><br />Of the Beatles, Emerick gives the least attention to Ringo Starr.  By any reputable standard, Starr was an important and innovative drummer as well as the most affable man one could wish to meet.  You wouldn't know that here.  There are three significant details we find out.  1.) Emerick worked with Starr to get the drum sound wanted often defying EMI's regulations on microphone placement.  2.) Starr would retire to a corner of the studio to play chess rather than stand around with nothing to do while the others haggled out what they wanted for the song.  3.)  As many other sources record, Emerick confirms that Starr became fed up with all the arguing during the WHITE ALBUM sessions and quit the band to the distress of the others.<br /><br />Of all the Beatles, in the beginning Emerick was the least impressed with George Harrison.  Emerick on the other hand tells us he never got to know Harrison beyond a strictly professional relationship.  Still, Emerick did not think much of Harrison's abilities as a guitar player and a musician.  Emerick notes Harrison's failure to come up with satisfactory solos--only to have McCartney come through with \\"absolutely brilliant\\" guitar playing that saved the day.  This opens up some peculiar questions.  If McCartney was the better guitarist, why was he regulated to the bass?  If Harrison was clearly so lacking, why did both Lennon and McCartney make him the lead guitarist?  We aren't told.<br /><br />Emericks' opinion of Harrison rose later in the Beatles sessions after George played more on the side with other musicians--particularly Eric Clapton.  Emerick also credits--perhaps as a revelation to no one but to himself--Harrison's immersion into Eastern music.  As Harrison began to produce other artists, Emerick professes amazement at Harrison's knowledge and command of the recording studio.  Emermick was greatly impressed when after the band finished completing \\"Let It Be\\" (the single) Harrison came back into the studio that night and put together a more sophisticated guitar solo to go in place of the rougher one that was recorded first that day.  (According to Emerick, the Hfirst solo was used for the album version while the much better one appears on the single.)  Toward the end, Emerick has nothing but praise for Harrison's \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\".<br /><br />When it comes to Paul McCartney, Emerick has little but praise and admiration.  At times one could be forgiven if one thought Emerick was of the opinion that McCartney could have been the Beatles all by himself.  In Emerick's telling, McCartney constantly contributes a brilliant guitar riff, drum beat or what have you just when it is needed while the rest of the Beatles are stymied.  Of course, McCartney's songs were just superb time after time.  If Emerick has anything negative to say about McCartney, it is found reading between the lines when McCartney welded a heavy hand in leading (intermittently bossing) the band during its last two years.<br />Emerick's effusive admirationfor McCartney has to be seen in the light of the plain fact that he has had a long personal and professional relationship with McCartney--a relationship that stretches from the early days of the Beatles through BAND ON THE RUN to McCartney's recent GOOD EVENING NEW YORK CITY where Emerick handled the audio mix, in both stereo and 5.1.  There is nothing wrong sticking up for one's friends.  It is just that the reader should be aware that Emerick's account of McCartney may be somewhat colored by their friendship.  The less charitable would suppose Emerick never bad mouths McCartney to continue to work with him.<br />There are several things one can glean from Emerick's book.  Here is a few:<br /><br />In spite of The Beatles huge contribution to EMI's coffers (almost 90% at times), EMI afforded them recording and studio equipment that was only adequate for times.  Certainly behind the state of the art technologies available to many other rock bands contracted to other labels.<br /><br />In the early part of The Beatles rise, the band toured like mad--constantly jumping all over the United Kingdom and Europe fighting to be noticed.  The recording sessions had to be sandwiched in to fit their schedule.  The Beatles were so exhausted that to Emerick's ears the breakout singles \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" sound tired.  Personally, I think the exhaustion from overwork is barely noticeable--enough to be easily ignored upon even close listening.<br /><br />As the Beatles progressed, they gradually pushed Brian Epstein out of their inner circle.  They grew increasing irritated when Epstein occasionally dropped in the studio to catch up with his most important clients.  As a general rule, The Beatles hated to have anyone around their recording sessions who were not directly involved to the process.  Given that Brian Epstein was so protective for The Beatles and saw to their needs, this was particularly cruel.  Yet, they were shook up deeply at Epstein's death.  (Unlike other writers, Emerick says nothing of Epstein's struggles with both his depression and his homosexuality.)<br /><br />By the time of WHITE ABLUM sessions, The Beatles were increasingly marginalizing George Martin, their longtime producer and innovator.  It was during these sessions, The Beatles engaged in their most acrimonious and bitter arguments.  The fights spilled over to the treatment of the recording staff.  At the very least, the fights made the staff uncomfortable and fed up if not a little frightened at times.  This eventually led to both Harrison and Starr temporarily quitting the band.  Finally, both Emerick himself and George Martin walked out of the studio and quit their association with the Beatles.  Neither would rejoin working for The Beatles until the Abby Road sessions after McCartney made urgent pleas to them both.<br /><br />McCartney and Lennon were dismissive toward Harrison and Starr's songwriting.  They thought Harrison and Starr were inferior performers and certainly several cuts below themselves.  McCartney and Lennon gave what they considered their lesser songs to Harrison and Starr to perform and record.  When either Harrison or Starr got their change to record, McCartney and Lennon rushed the sessions--giving little more than perfunctory effort in support.  Years later, both McCartney and Lennon admitted as much.  McCartney in particular expressed regret that he mistreated his \\"brothers.  The memory broke his heart as Harrison slipped to death.<br /><br />At first Yoko Ono was a mere presence in the studio when Lennon brought her in to be beside him.  This already broke one the Beatles cardinal rules against having wives and girlfriends around the creative process.  Gradually, Lennon and Ono became convinced Ono was a member of the band--much to the resentment and objection of the other three Beatles.  Emerick relates that Lennon and Ono took to taking various sound effect tapes from EMI's library and piecing together finger-paintings of noise into what they thought was art.  When Lennon insisted \\"Revolution #9\\" would be included on the WHITE ALBUM as well as the next single, George Martin, his staff and The Beatles strongly objected.  \\"Revolution #9\\" was not a pleasant work nor beautiful in any sense.  Something of an abuse toward the Beatles' loyal fans and devoted listeners.  While the idea of a single was scrapped, on the album it went.  It was during these \\"discussions\\" that Ono inserted herself for the first time stating that \\"Revolution #9\\" was the direction the Beatles should go from there on.  Emerick writes that a tomblike chill descended across the room.  It was a rupture the band never really recovered from.<br /><br />The album ABBEY ROAD came about at McCartney's pleading.  Everyone knew that the band was over; but McCartney in particular didn't want The Beatles to leave the world such a dispirited and acidic close. (McCartney never has liked LET IT BE album as a whole.  There were a handful of good songs.  Nevertheless, it was an inferior album which later turned out to be difficult for fans to digest.)  McCartney implored Martin, Emerick and the rest of the Beatles to come back for one last try.  Harrison, Starr and McCartney came back first and worked together for a few weeks without Lennon.  Lennon and Ono were off doing their legendary antics and John would not join the sessions until his business was done.  Emerick was surprised how free, cooperative and relatively harmonious Harrison, Starr and McCartney were.  When Lennon came back, however, tension immediately filled the room.  (It has to be remembered that while Lennon offered mostly scrapes of songs to the project he also contributed \\"Come Together\\"--one of the most memorable and celebrated rock songs on anyone's list.<br /><br />The one question that I have never found satisfactorily answered in any account of Beatles is just what happened between the \\"love and peace\\" days of SGT PEPPER and the fractious days of the WHITE ALBUM sessions that turned the relationships in the band sour.  One can piece together some individual facts.  Did the band lose essential glue when Brian Epstein died?  Did the critical beating the band took at the release of Magical Mystery Tour (the film) create disillusionment with the whole idea of The Beatles?  Without touring, The Beatles no longer a tight performing band.  Did that eventually cost the band a sense of unity (sort of the \\"us against world\\" brotherhood) that spells the demise of so many bands?  Was Lennon's girlfriend (Yoko Ono) lethally too much for the rest of the Beatles?  Did McCartney's benevolent (and then not so benevolent) dictatorship insult the growing maturity of the rest of the band?  Did the scandalous events at the end of spiritual retreat at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India create an unspoken gulf among them?  Was Lennon's heroin addiction a visible destructive force the rest of the Beatles had no personal resources to deal with?<br /><br />It could have been any one of these or some combination.  It could have other factors unknown to the general public.  Whatever was the case, Emerick doesn't tell us.  One may suspect that his close relationship with McCartney prevented Emerick from being entirely forthcoming; but there is no proof of this.<br /><br />Emerick tells of events in the post-Beatle years--including the infamous mugging of the McCartneys in Lagos, Nigeria that came close to ending in their deaths.  Frankly, these are anticlimactic.  At the close, we finally catch Emerick summing up his own expansive and extraordinary career in recording many of the great artists as well as having his hand in some of the great rock records in our memories.  Going from an inexperienced young boy just out of school to a well-seasoned recording engineer and producer forty years later is no mean accomplishment.  It was a smile of fortune and long hours of hard work.<br /><br />Lennon and Harrison are gone.  Only Starr and McCartney remain.  Starr says he was too drunk or high to remember much of what happened and McCartney isn't telling.  This leaves us with books such as this one to get some clue as to what happened in that crucible none of us will be privy to.  This a great book for those of us who still love The Beatles.

0230709532|5.0|I have been reading this book to my daughter since she was 6 months old. Though intrigued, she didn't get into flipping the flaps until 7 months of age. But, as soon as she was interested, I was surprised at how well she could figure out how to open all the flaps. The story is simple enough, the illustrations are great, and I love that the flaps all open from a different side on every page so that baby keeps engaged. She is 11 months now and still loves this book. Each animal gets a kiss now before she gingerly closes the flap and turns the page.  Definitely one of the top 3 most-read book in our home.  This will surely become a classic addition to any nursery.

0385737947|2.0|I really tried to love this book. I've been looking for a series/trilogy that would suck me up like Harry Potter did. I heard about The Maze Runner because I was hunting through the young adults (YA) section and this one kept coming up. The reviews were positive so I decided to take a chance. What I found was an intriguing story that was crippled by the poor writing.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the book I found cliche after cliche of bad story telling. A protagonist that knows the secret of a Maze. He has skills that nobody else has. He is marred by not knowing his past, he gets angry for no apart reason. After awhile I couldn't take the hero's constant whining and anger anymore. I started the loathe Thomas (the hero)...even more, I started to loathe the writer for making card board cut outs of characters that had no personality.<br /><br />James Dashner needs to gain a few more skills in descriptive narrative. Half way through the book I just started skipping whole paragraphs in order to get through the crummy dialogue.<br /><br />All in all a compelling story that is hindered by the awful writing. I liked the epilogue at the end of the book and it really leaves a cliff hanger for the next book, only that I can't see myself picking book 2 due to the bad story telling.
0812973992|5.0|This 2009 National Book Award Winner certainly deserves that prize.  It's the kind of novel I'm not likely to forget,  peopled with the kind of unique characters whose detailed descriptions zing with reality. Central to the story is the newsworthy incident of August 7, 1974,when a daredevil of a man drew the world's attention by walking a tightrope between the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City.  This is not a biography of that man however.  He is completely fictionalized.  Instead, this is the story of a handful of individuals who were effected by this event, some of whose lives were changed forever.  It is also the story of New York City and how it was in 1974.  I'm a New Yorker myself.  I remember how it was back then.  And I understand.<br /><br />Much of the story is set in the slums of the Bronx where we meet two Irish immigrant brothers, both in their twenties.  One of the brothers, Corrigan,  is a celibate religious fanatic who befriends the prostitutes who ply their trade under the Major Deegan bridge.  The other brother observes all this and tries to understand both his brother and the girls of the night whose stories come to light. This is just the bare introduction to the novel though and, after a tragic traffic accident which kills off two of the main characters, the story takes off in unique and surprising ways.  We get to meet several mothers from different backgrounds who are all mourning the loss of their sons in Vietnam.  We get to contrast life in a Park Avenue luxury apartment compared with life in the Bronx slums.  We get to meet a former counter culture woman who has a terrible secret and wants to change her life.  We even meet some early computer pioneers who hack into the phone lines near the World Trade Center during that famous tightrope walk.  Then there is the judge who must make a decision as to how to sentence the tightrope walker as well as a 38-year old prostitute grandmother of two young babies.  Yes, all these characters are there - big or bigger than life and completely developed.<br /><br />The book is 349 pages and a fast read.  It was hard for me to put down.  And when I wasn't reading it, I keep thinking about it, feeling I knew each of the characters personally, remembering an earlier troubled New York City, and relishing all the details that the author used in order to tell this story.  This is a really fine novel.  Reading it is a roller coaster joy.  Don't miss it!ers are there - big or bigger than life and completely developed.<br /><br />The book is 349 pages and a fast read.

B0038QMREA|5.0|I've been a fan for about a year now, thankfully discovered his music (not very mainstream) from a friend and had the opportunity to see him live.  It's a shame this artist isn't more well-known.  In any case, this album is fantastic, exactly what I was expecting, and slightly more polished than his first album.  Also the piano sneaks in here on the last track, which is a departure from his one-man-band guitarist lineup, and it's a beauty.  Buy this album, you won't be disappointed, and check out his earlier stuff too if you're not familiar.
B001UV4XX8|5.0|This film was outstanding. If someone doesn't like the film don't trust them. Why? BECAUSE THEY WOULD PUSH THE BUTTON.   Simple as that. If someone didn't like this and didn't get the straight forward moral message of this you would have to wonder about them now wouldn't you.    Also, this is based on a famous Richard Matheson short story and directed by 'Donnie Darko' Director Richard Kelly, so you can't go that wrong. Plus the cast and acting is first rate so come on. If you didn't like this movie it was probably because you are uncomfortable with it's message and that's really the scary part.                                                    James(alice fan)
0061922315|3.0|I'm not surprised that most reviewers seem to think that this book is a five-star winner.  It has \\"bestseller\\" written all over it! Currently, it is on the bestseller's list in Canada's major newspaper (the home country of the author)...eventually, it may break into the U.S. market and make the bestseller's list here, too.<br /><br />The novel is captivating. It has a compelling story that propels the readers along on an emotional rollercoaster ride. The reader is introduced to interesting characters and placed in exotic locals. The novel is rich with intellectual themes. It is easy to read and hard to put down. And at the end...well, I shouldn't tell you about that, should I?<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to readers who need a gripping tale to take along on a plane ride. This one will grab your attention and hold it while still not demanding too much thought in the process. You will feel emotionally drained when you finish. Also, you will feel like you've spent your time well getting to know interesting characters, and learning a lot about modern Indian culture.<br /><br />So, why did I rate this book three-and-a-half stars and not five? Simply put, it is very good popular fiction, but it is not literature. The plot is predictable. The writing is superior and very promising for a debut, but it is not outstanding. The characters are more real than you find in most bestsellers, but with the exception of Kavita, I found the characters to be two-dimensional, predictable, and stereotypical. It was a pleasure for me to find intellectual themes in a work of popular fiction, but their treatment lacked depth and complexity. Finally, the ending reminded me of what one is used to from a typical TV drama--there could have been far more character and thematic insight.<br /><br />The book is a very good work of popular fiction. It is a major achievement for a debut author. But the same themes and story could have been handled with far greater skill by talented literary authors...and it is this type of literary fiction that I enthusiastically seek and rate with five stars. Here are two fairly recent five-star books on modern India that I enthusiastically recommend: [[ASIN:0143055712 The Inheritance of Loss]] by Kiran Desai and [[ASIN:1416562605 The White Tiger]] by Aravind Adiga.it is this type of literary fiction that I enthusiastically seek and rate with five stars.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a great documentary film that I use in my Advanced Comp. class to teach how to write a classical argument.  The three filmakers use emotional and logical appeals to make a case for becoming more educated about what we choose to eat.  The film effectively argues against corporate factory food industries and gives some hope for the future for family farms.  This is a documetary that uses visuals and computer graphics to keep all viewers' eyes glued to the screen.
B000002L9B|4.0|I'll be frank and to the point. Under the Cherry Moon, is an often over looked gem. This album is so good primarily because, Wendy and Lisa aided Prince with musical composition. The overall continuity of this record rivals most of Prince's other works, except maybe, Purple Rain, Sign of the Times and 1999. A must have album; tight, concise and ahead of it's time.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|The studios are thriving on people's willingness to buy the same darned thing over and over.    This time we are getting the price of a full summer blockbuster release, but we are missing all of the special features. Often studios release two versions up front, including a less expensive version with just the movie. Now we get to pay full price and not get the features, but have the honor of paying even more for it all later.    I'm getting tired of this. I do want to see making-of features for a film like this so there's no way they're getting the money from me on this one.    The film is beautiful. The studio marketing is very, very ugly.

B0010ZR160|4.0|Based on a novel from the same author as Mystic River, this shares much of the same ambiguity and flawed characters of that movie. Set in the seedier and grittier parts of Boston, the tale revolves around a missing girl. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play the private detectives who are requested by relatives to help the search, and the beginning of the movie introduces us to a milieu which shows an unforgiving background for bringing up the child. The characters we meet include pimps, hard-assed barmen, mules (drug runners), dubious cops and various other dregs of society.   What is remarkable about the movie is how convincing is the air of authenticity of the neighbourhoods and houses. It all feels horribly real. And not least the characters, who all have their flaws as well as their streaks of humanity. Be warned, the language, particularly in the first third of the movie, is full of intense profanity which may put some off, but is certainly in keeping with the locales and personalities.   The story is gripping and extremely hard-hitting, this is certainly no Hollywood 'hero to the rescue' type film. It very realistically portrays all the emotions those involved in a case like this must go through, as well as the unpleasant circles they have to enter in order to find answers. The only problem is that this intensity sometimes gets lost in a storyline that seems unnecessarily complex and, at times, confusing. It's the sort of film where you very much have to concentrate or you'll soon lose the story thread, and considering the high emotions the film tackles, adding such a demanding storyline does leave you feeling a little exhausted.   Nonetheless the film has some very emotive drama and some very powerful performances. It effectively presents a moving moral dilemma but doesn't try and impose it's own opinion on you, instead it cleverly leaves you, the viewer, to make up your own mind.

B000000ISH|5.0|If you really want to know the meaning of Soul then listen to this album by Otis. This album shows how his rapidly developing talent had matured into excellent writing on his own songs such as \\"Ole Man Trouble\\", \\"Respect\\" and his biggest hit \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\".     Even the usual covers you get on most albums are delivered by Otis with that feeling of Soul which enhances how they were done by the original artists. Just see what I mean by his versions of \\" Change Gonna Come\\" by Sam Cooke, \\"My Girl\\" by Smokey Robinson, which was a hit for the Temptations, and so on.     One of the reasons the music on this album is so good, is that Otis was a multi talented artist who could sing, play several instruments and at around this time he was becomming a producer. So he could easily demonstrate to the musicians exactly what he wanted.     Here he is in control, because he makes the musicians do what he wants in order to put across the feelings he expresses with his excellent voice. Now off course for this to be successful he needs outstanding musicians and here he has them in the form of Stax's house band Booker T and The MG's and the horns of The Mar-Keys, which together makes a formidable combination.     This is a special album because most times I have to play it twice, as it brings back memories of life when I first heard it back in 1965 and memories which are still here today. I just can't get enough of it. Every track is special. So if you're a Otis fan like me then this is a must for your collection. If you're new to Soul music then this is an enjoyable road to begin and especially good to stimulate your curiosity of Otis's other works of art. So sit back and enjoy the Otis experience of real Soul.

0810982862|3.0|For the person who wants to comprehend the creative process in what will most likely be a visual icon for many years to come, this rather short work is a useful companion.    Few films have created as much controversy as 'Avatar'. From those who say that it is the work of the devil to those who complain about what the movie could have been, criticism seems to be boundless. This book is as perfect as the movie that it elaborates on.    James Cameron has, evidently, worked years on visually creating Pandora, the Na'vi, and the biosphere that they belong within. This book gathers some of his creative process in the form of drawings, sketches and accolades from his peers and co-workers. 'The Art of Avatar' is useful to the person who wants to explore the creativity behind the film and some of the development of key parts of the movie's biosphere, although there are some very large holes in explaining why certain approaches were taken.    The text ranges from informative to something of adoration of Mr. Cameron. Some of it is quite useful in understanding what went into the visual construction of this movie, but it is not an unbiased look at the creation of this remarkable film. The quality of the paper and the reproductions are marginal to good. Like the film, this book leaves one wishing for more: high resolution reproduction and high quality paper, less biased verbiage, more information both visual and textual.    Like the film, many flaws, but I return to it time and again with anticipation.

0920668372|5.0|I am surprised that anyone could call this book creepy.  The book is meant for a CHILD!  Children want to believe their mothers will always be there for them.  If you are looking at it from an adult perspective, which is ludicrous, since it is meant for children, then yes, it would be creepy, but so would A LOT of other fabulous children's books.  If you look at it from a child's point of view, it is about feeling secure that mommy will always love you and care about you.  All little kids want that reassurance and there is no harm in giving it to them.  This book does a great job of showing how a mother will always love her baby.  People that see this book as creepy actually creep me out.  Maybe they need to learn the difference between a fictional child's book and adult reality.  Just sayin'.

0810979772|5.0|Fantastic book. My two youngest kids - my son and daughter, respectively - loved the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do it Yourself book. It actually was for my son, but my daughter kept stealing it from him and writing her own things in it, thus creating arguments (typical for those two anyway). Now they both want more Wimpy Kid books from the series and she wants her own Do It Yourself book. I now have ideas for useful birthday and Christmas presents that's not another toy and motivates them to put their day and thoughts in written words and do so creatively.  THANK YOU Jeff Kinney.

B003162R7E|5.0|I think it's important to understand that this is the closest thing to what Jimi had intended to release in 1971 as the follow-up to the seminal Electric Ladyland album of 1968...    Having said that I have to say that I think this is the most impressive material of his career. These are the tightest batch of songs he recorded in that none of them are too long and all have tremendous hooks and content. The performances here are considerably better than past recordings due in part to the fact these are musicians who have played and toured together for successive years and are litterally at the top of their game. AND IT SHOWS!!! Hendrix's vocals are more controlled and less gimicky and he displays a lot more vocal range in general than before. His guitar parts are more structured and intricate. His solos less sloppy and more developed. His overall aura more tightly defined. And let's face it. Noel Redding wasn't the most impressive bass player (he was actually a guitar player by trade) and hearing Billy Cox on bass here makes you realize that Hendrix's material is far more fluid and soulful w/ him in the mix. Also, the production quality of the overall sound is better than his previous efforts. So much of it was recorded at his newly built Electric Lady Studios the Summer of 1970 and the fact that they were able to utilize the most state-of-the-art and up to date recording equipment is obvious when you hear the results.    It may be silly to say since Jimi Hendrix has become a bigger rock star since his death, but had he lived and kicked-off the decade w/ this release he would have owned the 70's. Zeppelin? Sure they were huge then but he would have been THE rock star defining the decade, Im sure of it.    Just have a listen to \\"Freedom\\" w/ it's locked-in beat, searing, white hot guitar licks, and Jimi's soulful vocal delivery. THAT is rock n' roll. \\"Izabella\\" continues right where \\"Freedom\\" leaves off and that's a good thing because \\"Freedom\\" seems way too short. \\"Dolly Dagger\\" and \\"Ezy Rider\\" are just pure ear candy. \\"Stepping Stone\\" has some of the hottest guitar licks ever recorded. Period. Just listen to the outro solo. \\"My Friend\\" is a pleasant surprise w/ it's Dylan-esque vocals and overall vibe. \\"In From The Storm\\" slams you over the head from the first notes of the guitar riff w/ it's dramatic hard rock delivery. The CD ends w/ the mellow blues of \\"Belly Button Window\\" and it's incredibly creative and sensitive lyrics from the perspective of drummer Mitch Mitchell's then unborn child.    I realize this was originally compiled and released in CD form back in 1997, but this is is the first I'm hearing it and I have to say I'm completely blown away....
B002RAREAK|3.0|I have been a fan from the beginning but... This is just a ok cd. I prefer to here him singing r&b (not pop) songs that is when the best of his singing ability comes out and to me when the songs stand out too. Which is how i feel about this cd. He needs to stick to the formula and trying things new leave that to the new artist. Either way still a fan for life.

B0038QMREA|5.0|If there was any doubt that the Tallest Man on Earth is an incredibly talented folk musician, this album will surely smash those doubts. This album ranges from upbeat make-you-wanna dance tracks to earthy hymns that float on the air and bring beauty to the ears. This album is much tighter than his first (although Shallow Grave is nothing to scoff at by any means). I highly recommend this album to the curious listener as well as Tallest Man's first album Shallow Grave.

I wish Amazon would fix their review which has managed to lead quite a few people to believe \\"Du Hast\\" translates into \\"You hate\\".  It does not.  I think I emailed them about this 4-5 years ago and I suppose it's not on their list of priorities.
B003956Z8O|5.0|MGMT stated that the album would be different then their debut album \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" and indeed it was. Starting off with the whole scartch-off cover, i found that really cool, along with the small coin that was used to scratch off the cover(only the checker pattern part scratches off). Now the album itself was fantastic, with its array of strange, rock/psychedelic sounds that joined together to create the piece called \\"Congratulations\\". \\"Flash Delirium\\" is definately my favorite on the album, but in true total, the rest is definately not filler and almost any song off this album could become a favorite; even the instrumental track \\"Lady DaDa's Nightmare\\".It relates to much of the music from the 60's all the way to todays music and in all creates an album i will be fond of for a very long time.

I simply want to say this: There are several authors and books I've read over the past twenty years that have made huge impacts in various areas of my life. And Gary's book is one of them. Last year I had never heard of Gary or his book. But I got a call to listen to him on NPR. I was so intrigued by what he was saying I bought the book. It has opened up the world of social media to me and inspired me to finally launch the business I had been thinking about for the last four years.

I even bought it on DVD at Costco when I was on my own and would watch it at least twice a year or more when I was in a really \\"Japanese\\" mood.  I was looking up something Japanese orientated at the library and this book popped up.  I remember a family member having this book, but I was too young to want to read it at the time.  Now, I thought, why rent it.  It's a major classic!  BUY IT!  It can't be that expensive!  I was wrong.  It's an old book so not as many people have it available.  Fortunately, I was able to get a nice copy of this version at a decent price.  Now I feature it prominently on my Living Room Bookshelf with my other not so classic, but favorite books.  I'll be reading it again next year.  Probably after I watch the mini-series again. ;)

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Oh gosh, where to begin with this awful movie.  I'll begin with the fact that there was so much better 2012 myth to draw from and somehow we got this as a movie.  I mean take any History Channel special on 2012 and turn it into a movie and it is already 10 times better than this.  In fact I would recommend just watching anything on 2012 on the History Channel over this, much better acting all around also.  The whole 'God' thing in the movie was such an obvious slap in the face and the total lack of actual science left me wondering who this movie was made for.  Just an awful movie that had no point.  And come on, there was no science up to the point where we found out the ships were boats and not space ships.  WHY!!!  The movie had no believable scenes(or science) up to that point, might as well have been space ships, why couldn't have the audience at least seen cool space ships!    I wrote a longer review but deleted it because what is the point, this was just a really bad movie that tried to have a message but was lost when it was just so unbelievable.  You could go two ways, have God's power the focus and make fun of science or make science the foundation and make fun of God.  This movie found a third path that makes fun of God and science, good job.

1405204265|5.0|Those who want to learn specifically about Taoism probably will not learn much from this book. I feel as though the author should re-title the book \\"Poohism\\". There is much more material gathered from \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" stories than from actual Taoism. I do not think that the author's views reflect those of Taoism and the author injects some negative views which sometimes detract from his presentation. Despite this problem, it is still a cool book.    I have been reading this book to get insight into life. So far, it has been pretty effective. The author offered some harsh criticism of academic people, like myself. After some self-examination, I realized that most of the criticism was well deserved. Also, during conversations with others, I would actually cite examples from this book. I would say something like...\\"The Tao of Pooh says 'blah blah blah...etc', therefore you should try to make amends with your roommate\\". It has been useful to me. The irony is that this book actually predicted that I would cite things from books and offer these things to others in a pedagogical manner. I probably behave like Owl more than I would like to admit.
1423113497|5.0|I picked this set up mainly because it was a great deal for the first three books in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. I figured it would be an economic way to check out a series that's gotten a lot of popularity.<br /><br />This set is, simply, an amazing buy, and can't be beat at $11. The books in the set are:<br /><br />-Percy Jackson and the Olympians #1: The Lightning Thief<br />-Percy Jackson and the Olympians #2: The Sea of Monsters<br />-Percy Jackson and the Olympians #3: The Titan's Curse<br /><br />Each book in the series is a contained adventure, but also part of a larger plot line that continues through the five books. I've reviewed each book separately; the reviews can be found on my profile/website if you're curious.<br /><br />The basic idea is that Percy Jackson is a young demigod, half human and half Greek god. He is the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea. He grows up over the course of the books, starting at age 12 and finishing at 16. Percy's life is full of adventures and dangers, as he often heads off on quests to save his friends or Camp Half-Blood, sanctuary of the demigods. In \\"The Lightning Thief,\\" Percy and his friends must find Zeus's stolen lightning bolt. In \\"The Sea of Monsters,\\" they hunt for the Golden Fleece. And in \\"The Titan's Curse,\\" the young demigods search for a missing friend as well as the Greek god Artemis.<br /><br />Percy Jackson and the Olympians is an outstanding series, one that I will be rereading often. Riordan's writing is witty, humorous, educational, fun, etc.; these are great books for kids and parents to read together.<br /><br />5/5.

1423101472|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians #5: The Last Olympian, by Rick Riordan<br /><br />The adventures of Percy, a young demigod, are almost at an end. \\"The Last Olympian\\" is the last volume in the series, wrapping up an epic story that's spanned five books.<br /><br />Percy's final showdown with the Titan lord Kronos is imminent, and he and the other demigods must hold out against the Titans to save Mount Olympus and America. Riordan's created a situation right for plenty of action and suspense, and he delivers brilliantly in the conclusion to the series. Normally I'm anxious about reading the last book in a series, but I had no fears about unresolved endings or a lackluster finish with Riordan.<br /><br />Readers will rejoice as they accompany Percy, his friends, and other Camp Half-Blood demigods on their fight to save New York City and Mount Olympus, overcoming incredible odds. Several characters from previous books join the fight, giving readers an opportunity to welcome back old favorites.<br /><br />An excellent book, and an amazing series. Very highly recommended.<br /><br />5/5.

1423101499|4.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians #4: The Battle of the Labyrinth, by Rick Riordan<br /><br />Percy and company traipse into Daedalus's Labyrinth in this installment of the popular Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. They are in search of the maze creator's workshop, looking for a way to seal the Labyrinth off from the Titan lord Kronos.<br /><br />Riordan re-imagines the mythological Labyrinth as a sprawling construct beneath the entire United States, growing and adding to itself, with a conscious to boot. The maze provides plenty of action for readers, along with some tense moments as Percy and his friends journey through it.<br /><br />Percy's adventure continues in \\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\\" with the author's trademark mix of Greek mythology and fast-paced action, and isn't a book to be missed.<br /><br />4/5.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|I love this new music from Natalie Merchant. I am not famillar with all the classic poems these songs come from, but I like all of the songs.  My favorite song is \\"Topsy Turvy World\\". It has a good regaae song.  I love the horns playing on this song. \\"Janitor's Boy\\" is another track I love. This song has a pleasant jazzy tone.  I love the trumpets playing on this song.  \\"Nursery Rhyme Of Innocence and Experience\\" is a beautiful track.  This inspiration for this song comes from a classic poem by William Blake. I love violin and guitar playing on this track. This song is very soothing. \\"Maggie and Millie and Molly and May\\" is a lovely song about friendship.  This song comes from a poem by E. E. Cummings. \\"The Man In The Wilderness\\" is a very pretty track.  The musical arrangements give this song a romantic tone that I love. \\"The Dancing Bear\\" is a fun song that makes me want to dance. I love the accordion playing on this song. \\"The King Of China's Daughter\\" has an Asian tone that is exquisite to listen to. \\"Spring and Fall To A Young Child\\" has a somber tone to it. This song is very moving.  This song comes from a poem by Gerald Manley Hopkins. \\"Adventures of Isabel\\" is an upbeat song that makes me feel happy. I love the banjos and violins on this song. Natalie has never sounded better.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|When I first saw this film I fell in love.(Admitted- I was first shocked of Amanda Roots being Anne, because she looked older than 27, but I like her playing and in the end I find her very pretty in a natural way. Besides, nowadays we've got a total different notion of beauty)  Everything is perfect in this adaption: from the actor and actress playing Cpt. Wentworth and Anne, over the story and how the film is developped over the choice of music( extremely beautiful).    This is my absolute favourite film adaption of Jane Austen's novel ( except maybe Pride & Prejudice with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth).  If I could, I would award this film more than 5 stars.
B001E454NY|5.0|After a bit of research, I purchased from Amazon the 2008 Blu-ray edition of Pride & Prejudice. It appears to be the same as the much-lauded British version, with its longer main feature playing time and reportedly better video. It even has a \\"Made in England\\" sticker on it! It has the 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack and runs, according to the label, approximately 327 minutes. Special features include the HD Restoration Piece but not the cast interviews or walkabout. I'd much rather trade some \\"special features\\" for more \\"main feature\\"!     I'm not sure why it was re-released in 2009 in an apparently inferior format. I say \\"reportedly\\" and \\"apparently\\" because I have not viewed the 2009 release but have read several reviews on the Web comparing the two. There were still a few of the 2008 version left on Amazon last time I checked, but the price has shot up. It may also be available elsewhere on the Web. I think it is probably worth hunting for! The longer playing time alone made searching for the 2008 version worthwhile for me.
0767020308|5.0|This is a wonderful adaption of one of my favourite novels of Jane Austen.     A short summary of the story:  The heroine of the story is Emma and is a young, intelligent and very beautiful woman of high social rank and with a large fortune. Due to all these factors she is a little bit spoiled and has sometimes a too good opinion of herself. She is determined never to marry except when being in love- she needn't to marry only to rise socially nor to gain more fortune anymore.   So she thinks that she does a good deed by helping other women of inferior social status to marry better but ends up in doing everything much worse.  Happily, like in all books by Jane Austen, there is a happy end.     Some points which I like most in this film:  This film may be not made as cinematique as all the other Emma adaptions, but it shows a very realistic, amiable, charming and also funny picture of the society of the 19th century.   The characters of Emma and Mr Knightley are excellent portrayed, especially the latter is the Mr Knightley I've always imagined. I've seen some extracts of the new Emma- film and I have to admit that I don't like Knightley in those one very much, maybe because Johnny Lee Miller looks so young and he plays Knightley a little bit too nice, but this is a matter of taste.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show and have watched every episode at least 3 times. The characters are great and the interaction between them is very fun.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|When the show first hit our television screens in 2006, I loved it, and still do as a matter of fact.   ABC, the television network in the US, has axed the show due to low ratings, this could be due to the fact that they kept on changing the timeslot of the show, so no-one could really find out which day or time, it was on.   The writing is fantastic, the characters also. Season 4 (the final season) is ending tonight as i write this I look back on all the amazing moments ugly betty has given us, it was the greatest show on TV, and still is in millions of ugly betty fans today (including myself). But fear not, as a brand new show called 'Glee' you might of heard of it seeing as the show has become an international phinominon XD. But this is'nt about glee (which is my favirote show at the moment, apart from doctor who, desperate housewives, gossip girl, murder she wrote, 3rd rock from the sun, the simpsons etc... lol), this is about the fantastic show ugly betty, which I and many other will miss dearly.     We love you betty.   Goodbye :).
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is a wonderful story about love and humanity crossing borderlines. Michael Oher- marvellous: Quinton Aaron- is a seventeen year old homeless black boy with as many possessions as you can put in a plastic bag. He is sensible and intelligent, but not in the way society expects. He can barely read and his marks are more based on the schools trying to get rid of him than on his real knowledge. His mother can't even remember his father's name, because her life is controlled by crack. But one thing changes \\"Big Mike's\\" life forever. His neighbour applies for his son's and Michael's education to a Christian school. As Michael is an extraordinary talented football player, the school remembers its Christian roots and gives him a chance. There he meets the Tuohy family. Lee Ann, the mother - Sandra Bullock at her best- fights against all prejudices to give young Michael a proper future. Finally the Tuohys adopt Big Mike as a legal member of their family. With some help of his tutor Miss Sue, Michael gets the chance to be admitted by several famous colleges. So he achieves everything he never even dreamed of, a beloved and loving family, a great and strong mother and a way to live his life. This film, based on a true story, shows us in an absolutely wonderful, silently funny and heart warming way that fate doesn't have to be unchangeable.   I recommend this film to anybody who'd like to get back their belief in humanity.

0307463745|4.0|Jason Fried and David Heinmeier Hansson bring a lot to the table in this book. They bring the same style and tone from their blog signal vs. noise, which isn't a bad thing. From what was spoken about the book you almost expect the book to be more - maybe a manifesto for their outlook on business. Yet the book stays narrow in scope. Page after page deliver clear hows and whys of business, management and strategy.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I think a lot of people should read the book, and it helped put a name on some pitfalls to avoid (namely staffing & client relationships). Yet at the end of the book I was wondering where the amazing summary and conclusion for all this thinking was. There isn't much of a summary at all. The book ends as it starts and it's done.<br /><br />On the flip side, this may be a bonus who wants to read a great book without having to really dive into it. Rework is a book you can read 1.5 pages per sitting and get a lot out of it.<br /><br />I liked it when I read it, and I'll reference it in the future. I think it was a good purchase.

030726999X|5.0|**May contain spoilers for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire**<br /><br />If you have read the first two novels, then let me say that The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is a worthy conclusion to this electrifying trilogy.  However, it's also very different from the first two books, to the point where I'm not entirely certain it's even a mystery.  It's much more a procedural novel, investigating how far the Zalachenko conspiracy goes within the Swedish government and also the process of proving Lisbeth's innocence.  As a result, I'm certain that some people who loved the first two novels won't like this one.  It's much slower and more methodical.  That being said, I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Finishing The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest makes me realize how ingenious Stieg Larsson really was.  The first book in the series was a relatively straightforward mystery - it was incredibly well-written and introduced some very intriguing characters, but nevertheless, it was easy to classify.  Lisbeth was almost a secondary character in that novel - I'd argue that Mikael Blomkvist was the main character of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />However, Lisbeth Salander takes the central role in The Girl Who Played With Fire, and all of a sudden, the scope of the trilogy changes from mysteries to learning about the origins of a very interesting character.  In my view, the final book is the conclusion to Lisbeth's story, her finally getting the justice she deserves.  Because she has been so physically and mentally abused, this is an incredibly satisfying novel.<br /><br />I was very glad to see that Larsson chose to make each of the novels in the Millennium Trilogy different.  As a result, he has made it a tour de force, a masterpiece, rather than simply three well-written and engaging mysteries.  Despite the fact that this novel was over 550 pages, I couldn't put it down.  I had to know that things would turn out okay for Lisbeth, not to mention there were multiple absorbing subplots and the introduction of some very interesting characters.<br /><br />It's a tragedy that Stieg Larsson passed away after turning in the manuscripts for these three incredible novels - the world has a lost a literary giant.  But I'm so glad that he left behind the fascinating character of Lisbeth Salander, explored through the Millennium Trilogy.  I can't recommend these three books highly enough - read them (in order), and I hope you will enjoy them as much as I did.h, not to mention there were multiple absorbing subplots and the introduction of some very interesting characters.<br /><br />It's a tragedy that Stieg Larsson passed away after turning in the manuscripts for these three incredible novels - the world has a lost a literary giant.

B0021L8UPS|2.0|This movie is pretty much just a remake of The Good Son with a lame M Night Shyamalan-ish twist at the end. Somebody falls through the ice? Check. A climactic treehouse fall? Check. Mother previously lost a child? Check. Drownings? Check. Animals murdered? Check.    While the acting in this wasn't that bad, Macaulay Culkin did a much more believable job as an evil child that fools the parents. There was very little in this movie that actually made it worth sitting through the whole thing. The twist at the end was so weak that it actually offended me that the writers expected us to accept that as logical and possible. Who honestly finds people like Gary Coleman and Andy Milonakis frightening? Nobody, that's who.
0812976525|2.0|Reading this book was required for a class that deals with how logic and persuasive techniques can be used in compliance. Based solely on that aspect, Thank You for Smoking delivers. But what it doesn't do is reveal the \\"secrets\\" of the tobacco industry as much as it would seem. The pages, even whole chapters are filled with this mindless dialogue which is very irritating to read. Seriously there are pages and pages of which two people talk back and forth over mostly irrelevant topics. I would estimate this comprises nearly half of the book. When the tobacco industry is actually talked about it is interesting and entertaining but for I feel its not worth the effort.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|Set in 60s London, \\"An Education\\" centers on 16-year-old Jenny (Carey Mulligan delivering a finely-nuanced performance) who is preparing for her 'A' Levels for entrance into Oxford University. Jenny plays the cello, has a keen eye for art, and wants to read English at Oxford. Her father Jack (credibly portrayed by Alfred Molina) wishes to see his only child in a prestigious university as a means of elevating their status as a family. A rainy day changes everything as Jenny's path crosses that of a smooth-talking older man, David (Peter Skarsgaard who delivers a compelling performance despite a rather weak English accent). David entices Jenny to take a ride in his coveted Bristol and Jenny finds herself slowly but surely falling for Peter and his sophisticated ways. The pair dine out in fancy restaurants, listen to jazz music in cool clubs, and live the high life together with Peter's friends, Danny (Dominic Cooper, who has also appeared in movies such as [[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)]] and as James Willoughby in [[ASIN:B0012OVCE6 Sense & Sensibility (with Miss Austen Regrets) (BBC TV 2008)]] and Danny's girlfriend Helen (Rosamund Pike, who has also appeared in a BBC period drama, [[ASIN:B000GIXLUC Wives and Daughters]]. Suddenly, the previously sheltered Jenny finds herself being swept off her feet and introduced to a sophisticated, fun new world she had only dreamed of in the past.<br /><br />Inevitably, the once studious and hardworking Jenny begins to falter as her studies take a backseat to nights out, weekends off in the country, and even a trip to Paris. Her parents fall for David's charm and the social climbing Jack goes as far as to determine that Jenny might as well give up Oxford if she manages to get David to marry her. No one really has a clue as to how David manages to finance his high-flying lifestyle, though Jenny does find out sometime in the movie and begins to see a darker side to David and his life. There are more revelations to come before the movie ends, and the question is: Will Jenny be able to realize her potential? Will her informal \\"education\\" procured during her time with David be sufficient for her or is there still a place for formal schooling in her life?<br /><br />I thought the film was beautifully made - the scenic setting, the 60s lifestyle and the myriad themes explored all blend together convincingly to create a truly poignant coming-of-age tale. Carey Mulligan (who first impressed me in a secondary role in[[ASIN:B000Z27HLS Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey]] delivers both a delightful and heartbreaking performance as the confident yet ultimately vulnerable young child-woman. The chemistry between Mulligan's Jenny and Skarsgaard's David is credible and powerful - one can see that there's a certain neediness in David that is assuaged by being with the young Jenny, and Jenny in turn is intoxicated by the power she wields over David. The rather sensitive issue of sex between a 17-year-old and a much older man is subtly addressed and there are no exploitative or gratuitous scenes to offend anyone's sensibilities (though it probably merits mentioning that the age of consent in Britain is 16).<br /><br />Final verdict - a fine coming-of-age tale set in a time when the sexual revolution and feminism were about to take serious flight.before the movie ends, and the question is: Will Jenny be able to realize her potential?

I read the book then spent some time redrawing the list of expressions from the back section (worth the price on its own) and though I'm still learning I am now able to express the exact mood I want on a face, something that has eluded me for years. I have never had the experience of reading a drawing book and then seeing results from it but that is exactly what happened. You learn what is going on with the muscles, features, etc. that make an expression look the way it does. I agree that this book is a must have for illustrators.
B00371QQ2U|3.0|Bought this yesterday and was looking forward to seeing it in hi-def. This is one of my all time favourite movies.<br />I've never had a problem with blu-ray movies before watching them or loading them on my Playstation 3 however Universal have come up with some new technlogy which is just so annoying that it's almost not worth the purchase.<br />After you insert the disc, you'd expect that it would load in a matter of seconds, like any other blu-ray.  Not so with this one.  It actually goes out onto the web and hooks up with the Universal website.<br />After it finally loads (roughly 3-4 minutes), when scrolling through the screens you get adverts for other Universal movies popping into the menus which is really annoying.<br />If you decide to pause the movie, after a few seconds, the Universal logo will appear. Pressing the pause button again or the play button on the Playstation remote does not restart the movie. I finally found that you have to press the \\"top menu\\" button to get the movie to resume.<br />The movie itself is extremely good and works very well in hi-def (some shots, especially of archived news footage does appear a bit grainy but that's not the movies fault) and there are some very good extras on the disc (the making of presentation is definately worth watching).<br />Overall an excellent movie totally ruined by Universal. I now have serious doubts as to whether I'll be purchasing any other Universal movie on Blu Ray again.
B003498SDA|5.0|This film is one of Michael Mann's all time best (only \\"Heat\\" beats it in my opinion).  Great action, well paced, and well acted.

B002WCNGGY|4.0|The game is similar to Pictionary but instead of drawing, you use Legos.<br /><br />What is in the game:<br /><br />-- a Lego Dice, which has the categories that can be found on the cards (Buildings, Nature, Things, Vehicles) as well as a You Choose and Double (which is like You Choose but you get double points if you guess.<br /><br />-- a set of 96 cards divided into Easy, Medium and Hard that have pictures on them for different categories that are on the Lego Dice (Buildings, Nature, Things, Vehicles)<br /><br />-- a building tray to sort the pieces by color<br /><br />-- an assortment of 338 Lego pieces<br /><br />How to Play:<br /><br />The instruction booklet describes several different ways you can play the game, but all basically come down to building what is on the card and having someone else guess what you built. The game itself can be pretty challenging -- even for adults. My 5-year-old was able to play it though, and I think most kids familiar with Legos could play it. The recommended ages are 7 and up.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I think it is creative way to play with Legos, and a game that the entire family could participate in -- even my husband enjoyed playing it! I think it definitely encourages imagination and creativity. I also appreciate that Lego provided an assortment of ways to play ... and I'm sure most families could think up their own rules to adapt their own needs. This is only one of a whole new series of games by Lego but we chose this one because it seemed to the most open-ended and best suited to the age of our son. When he gets older, I'm sure we'll be checking into some of the other Lego games that are just being released.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Good movie with more strength than weakness.  The story is interesting and fun to follow and a lot of performances by unknown actors (to me at least) are better than that of the big names.  Pitt was fun at times, but didn't really cut it as a general - somehow he still seems too young and pop and I think even he was having a hard time believing his over the top accent.  While so many of the other actors in this World War II France put in believable top notch performances, I'd pop right out of the spell when Pitt and the gang came on though they occasionally added comic relief which may have been the point partly.  I agree with other reviews that call the Pitt factor a weak link in a film that almost could have been a masterpiece.  Still it's Tarrantino's style not to play it straight all the time, even amidst seriousness - the quirkiness that Pitt and his scalping crew brought to the movie sometimes did add an enjoyable fast food element.  And you know we love fast food but you don't confuse it for fine dining. This was a movie half sirloin, half hamburger - actually a formula that often produces success.  I just wonder how it would have been if they'd used different \\"hamburger\\".    Good work by many actors, supporting and otherwise, the film was suspenseful, fairly clever and finally quite entertaining.  Some of the best performances in this movie came from those playing Nazis - like a good mafia movie, there's so much tension beneath the pleasantries.  Both leading ladies were good as well.  This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since Pulp Fiction that I've felt half enthused about. While not perfect, it had an element that has long been missing from his films - substantial story and interesting characters.
B000099T2L|2.0|I got this album about 6 to 7 years ago and I initially didn't like it. I thought it was because the good songs were the radio singles and the rest were fillers or that maybe I had to give some songs some time to sink in. Well nope.    In the last two years since I started playing two instruments I've learned to appreciate real songs and how they're put together and looking back at this album it's still crap. I expected to hear songs with background music along the lines of say my name, independent woman pt 2, or from the last destiny's child album, cater 2 u, lose my breath, etc but the radio singles and the other songs on the album are like day and night. The main problem is the background music on the other songs are very bland and lack any real arrangements or diversity in instruments used in the songs. Also there were too many slow songs and not enough faster more upbeat songs and even the slow songs lacked life.     If you really want to know whether to buy the cd or not.

B00371QQ2U|1.0|I was excited to get the new Apollo 13 on blu-ray which shipped to me yesterday from Amazon. Imagine my great disappointment when it wouldn't play! My player has the latest updates, but after I plugged in the CD and waited, the menu never displayed. The menu screen with music and swirling images showed up, but the selectable menu items (play, setup, special features, etc) never displayed. It was Blank! I tried multiple times with the different languages but it never worked.  In looking at different reviews, it seems that you are REQUIRED to have an active internet connection for this movie to work. That is BAD! So, I returned it back to Amazon. So sad!    2nd Update 4/15/2010 -------    Well, I was getting ready to ship my new Apollo 13 Blu-Ray movie back to Amazon when I came and read the other reviewers comments. They were instructive and made me think, \\"Well, maybe I was TOO hasty. Let's go back and see if it will load if I wait longer.\\" So, I re-plugged the DVD into my player. At the prompt, I set my language to English, and then waited until the blank main menu showed up. I set my timer to 20 minutes and went back to work. At the end of 20 minutes I checked... and STILL a blank menu. I re-set my timer for yet another 20 minutes. Same results. No joy.    My only conclusion is that Universal purposely sabotaged the user experience, making the actual functioning of the movie not only dependent on the player, but dependent on having an active internet connection. So, having an up to date blu-ray player is not enough to play this movie.     If movie distributors are going to perpetrate this kind of JUNK, then they need to explicitly say on the box cover you need internet connectivity to make these movies work.
B002VECM4K|5.0|This movie should be mandatory for all high school students. This shows how you can overcome obstacles and become a wonderful person. Shows how people do not have to use their past as an excuse for bad behavior in adulthood. This movie was inspirational.  Makes you stop and re-evaluate your life.  Gives  a new perspective on life.

0307474275|1.0|There was an MST3k version of some movie where, in vague sorority fashion, an inductee to a society of young women is given something to drink and told that they drink blood at initiations. Then one of them explains that the drink is really some kind of strawberry concoction, and they all laugh. One of the silhouetted commentators at the bottom of the screen interjects, \\"It's kind of like we're smart, except that we're not.\\"<br /><br />There's something about The da Vinci Code that is very, \\"It's kind of like we're smart, except that we're not.\\" To someone who has really sunk teeth into history, or theology, or almost anything else that is used for ambiance, talking about The da Vinci Code as a book you can sink your teeth into is like talking about a plastic sponge you can sink your teeth into.<br /><br />Can I offer an alternative? For my contribution, after thinking that I wanted to provide an alternative, I did research, including reading a number of medieval versions of the Arthurian legends, and wrote, [[ASIN:0615202195 The Sign of the Grail]]. It's meant to offer a better treatment of the Holy Grail, one that offers something better than, \\"It's kind of like we're smart, except that we're not.\\" At very least John Borroughs of the Midwest Book Review found something to sink his teeth into.

B002JCSWVG|5.0|I am eagerly awaiting the release of Invictus on BluRay.  I saw this in theatres when it came out, and I left the theatre as did most people with I think a look and a sense of complete wonderment on my face.  I often feel jaded when seeing films nowadays (for no reason other than this world can make you see films through a prism of cynicism), but Invictus is one of those rare gems that manages to be both a brilliant sports film, and a brilliant political film about the psyche and power of sport, and its ablility to unite, in every sense of the word, and even under the most fractured conditions where incredible distrust and animosity from years of apartheid and other injustices reign.      The film sports some incredibly accurate and authentic rugby scenes (I am a fairly new supporter of the sport beginning from the 2003 World Cup- I would also recommend \\"Forever Strong\\" for some of you rugby fanatics), accurately demonstrating the pulverizingly brutal, but ultimately gentlemanly nature of the warriors who play this incredible sport.  More importantly, and what I always believe makes a sports movie rise above the rest is the story of the people in it. This movie is equal parts Francois Pienaar (M. Damon), and Nelson Mandela (M. Freeman).  The genius of Mandela was in sensing the incredible power that Sport had over the previously ruling White Class, and in selling his political plan for unification of South Africa by bringing about reconciliation between whites and blacks.  Mandela does this by convincing Francois Pienaar (captain of SA national Rugby team) and by extension, the Other SpringBoks (nickname for South African Rugby squad) that a victory in the 1995 Worldcup would unify South Africa, even though skepticis abounded at at every turn.      Mandela exhibited political genius by being able to credibly assert to his supporters (who wanted all symbols associated with Springboks eliminated from national discourse) that if he, who had suffered worse than most under apartheid could forgive (and his suffering is given some treatment in the movie in a trip by the Springboks to Robben Island where Mandela was imprisoned and where the players see what he had to actually endure), than they should also be able to forgive, and move on in bringing together the new South Africa- both black and whites.  Mandela knows and gambles ultimately on the unifying power of Sport itself and particularly the Springboks who are revered by White South Africans, but hated by Blacks as they represented a symbol of apartheid and opporession.     Slowly through a series of political maneuvers and with the help of Francois Pienaar who slowly begins to understand and believe in Mandela's plan, and even begins to understand what it means to be South African, and redefines his national identity.  How Mandela does this is in my opinion the result of some real political genious and courage.     Clint Eastwood, once again, delivers a terrific film.  There are just so many moments of this movie that I absolutely love and cannot wait to see again.  So many minor characters that leave grand impressions (like Mandela's head of security and many of the white security forces who are working with Mandela's security team to keep him alive and safe). The scenes never feel forced or cliched.  It is just beautifully done, and I would recommend this to anyone.  I believe that you will turn off your DVD player once this film is over with a sense of wonderment at just incredible this all was, and moreso, that it was true, and you will repeat those words, \\"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\\", Invictus \\"unconquerable\\".  What a great Film!  Thanks for reading.

B00005R23S|3.0|I was hoping to hear many of Bruce's covers and pop tunes. I quickly realized this DVD is for die hard Bruce fans. Many of the songs I have never heard before and they were boring to me. It seemed to me that big Bruce was at many points coaxing the crowd to get more into it but the problem was too many ballads not enough rockin. I couldn't even watch the whole thing it was so long and boring. I grew up hearing much of his work in the 80's and loved it but many of those tunes were absent or there were so many obscure ballads to wade through to hear one \\"good\\" song I got tired. I tried skipping to the next song over and over and each time I would get something boring with the occasional hit that I could remember. No disrespect to Bruce or his fans but if you are expecting an exciting concert and hit after hit, this is not for you.
B0033G9OFA|2.0|This isn't a CD that you will want to hear over and over.  The sound quality is not as good as other Doors remasters and what's worse, having Johnny Depp recite Jim Morrison's poetry was a mistake.  Depp's voice is too soft and it doesn't project the wild, dynamic spirit of Jim Morrison.  I did enjoy the live version of \\"Break On Through (To The Other Side)\\" that was included on this CD.  Your money would be better spent on the Doors studio albums or the many Live CDs.  I've always believed that the Doors were one of the greatest American bands but this CD feels like somewhat of a ripoff.  This type of fluff is definitely not what the Doors were about.

B000068TPN|4.0|I rarely bother to watch any Nam movies for a variety of reasons.  Mostly because I was there and none of them are really a good depiction of what it was like or what went on.  But this one was highly recommended to me by some other Nam vets so I gave it a try.  Yes.  They pretty near just about got it right.  Including the parts about cab drivers delivering telegrams to widows who didn't know they were!  I suppose the impact on the soilders' families is a big part of why this movie tells more of the real story than any of the others have.  It's not the usual action/adventure story that others have produced.  Want to get a much better idea of what it was like?  Watch this one.
B00382S9V4|2.0|I'm not going to do a movie critique. The Affair's remake is more than 10 years old and everything worth saying about contents, cinematography and actors' acting and looks has been said already. Suffices for me to say that this is a flick I enjoy watching whenever I feel like relaxing, probably because I like watching Pierce Brosnan. Also, it turns out, The Thomas Crown Affair was the first DVD I ever bought - selection was scarce back in 1999. Which partially explains why I ordered the Blu-ray. Sadly, what the postman brought was somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />So, here is my objective evaluation of the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />- It comes in a cheap case. The kind with holes cut into the plastic walls so that maybe a couple of pennies are saved this way.<br />- It includes both the Blu disc and a double-sided DVD with the so-called 'full screen' on one side and the 'wide screen' version on the other.<br />- There are no extras whatsoever on the Blu disc.<br />- The DVD disc, apparently has one 'extra' - audio commentary by director John McTiernan<br />- Sound is 5.1 DTS-HD<br />- Alternative soundtracks are available in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese as 5.1 DTS and in mono for Russian, Hungarian, Turkish and Thai.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is just okay. The movie looks and sounds good but I imagine there is some industrial process these days where you throw a DVD into the Blu-ray converter machine and the Blu version comes out automatically - better than the DVD and not much human artist or technician intervention is required. There is nothing outstanding or worth writing about when it comes to this Blu-ray upgrade, other that my brand new, first time watched, unscratched copy skips in two places.<br /><br />This is the first Blu-ray disc ever that skipped on my player. After almost 3 years of Blu-ray watching, I didn't know what Blu-ray skipping looks like. Now I know - the picture disappears for a few seconds, then it reappears. I know that it's skipping, not an equipment issue because I replayed the parts that skipped and was able to reproduce it - probably due to some low quality, cheap process used to produce the discs.<br /><br />I really hesitated between a 3-star rating which means \\"It's Okay\\" and a 2-star which stands for \\"I don't like it\\". In the end, the \\"I don't like it\\" won. I can't recommend this Blu-ray as a purchase, especially to those who already have the DVD. I understand that studios need to make money but, my friends, the quality of this release borders 'junk' grade and we should not encourage the proliferation of such releases by buying them. I am sorry I spent money on my copy and, had I known before ordering what I know now, I would not have placed my order.replayed the parts that skipped and was able to reproduce it - probably due to some low quality, cheap process used to produce the discs.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|While at first I thought that $80 was somewhat pricey for this product, I am extremely happy that I purchased it.  The packaging is first rate and not a cheesy DVD holder.  Included with the DVD's is a fold out heavy paper list of characters who play major parts in the Series, including photos.  Inside, on each DVD holder, is a brief description of the episodes on that particular disc.  The quality of the discs themselves is excellent, with no problems upon viewing.  This product will give years of excellent, quality viewing.  If you have seen any part of this series, I strongly recommend that you purchase Rome, the Complete Series.  The product resembles a hard back book and will look very good on anyone's entertainment center.
B0024F08RO|2.0|Without wanting to include spoilers in the review, it's just a shame that the writers decided to steer the fourth season as a soap opera. It is pretty clear that everyone ran out of good ideas midway through the season. The plot became less and less believable, and soon was laughable. There was good suspense, and interesting ending to individual shows (which makes you want to start a new one), but that's not all viewers should be interested in. At one point, you will simply lose interest with the weird stories and number of side stories. When the series aired originally, I simply stopped watching and only recently decided to finish - that proved a waste of time.    Writing 23 episodes of interesting \\"prison break\\" plot is not an easy task, and we unfortunately see that in Season 4. Seasons 1 to 3 are really good though, and about 50% of season 4 is acceptable.

0743289692|5.0|Ayaan's book should be required reading for political science majors, religious studies majors, international studies majors, etc...  Here is a woman who grew up in Somalia and Kenya, then went to live in the Netherlands.  The contrasts were startling to her and Ayaan looks at these differences in the two societies from a  perceptive we in the West do not often get, from the outside looking in.  She also has an incredible memory for details.  How she remembers all these incidents in her life to such detail is beyond me.  Possibly it comes from growing up in a cultural where much of the history and lore is handed down from generation to generation verbally.  She memorized her family history back some 8 hundred years at the age of five.  Ayaan sees religion as a crucial element in how society operates.  For instance, she compares the reactions of both Somalians and the Dutch to flooding.  The Somalis pray, fatalistically attributing the event to the will of God, while the Dutch blame the government for not maintaining the dikes.      The fact that Holland is a country extracted from the sea is in itself astounding to her and points to the industriousness of a people who take control of the lives and their environment.  The Netherlands became a focal point of the European Enlightenment possibly because of the necessity to work and create a country in spite of Gods design of keeping it underwater.  Ayaan may attribute too much to religion in her anaylses and comparisons; like attributing the chaos and lack of government in Somalia to Islam, but she does make some good points.  And to her credit, she is critical of all orthodoxy and fanatical religious groups, including the Orthodox Jews in Israel.

B001OQCV6K|3.0|I have been a big fan of Sir Arthur Conin Doyle's Sherlock Holmes as long as I can remember.  This Sherlock lacks the intellect yet manages to annoy everyone including Dr Watson with his arrogance and lack of courtesy.  To be sure Holmes has always been an insufferable bore at times, but this version is about making Hollywood money and does not concern itself with trivial matters such as staying true to the character.    The new formula in Hollywood is take existing super heros and remake them into unstopable super heros appealing to the mindless teenage audiance of today that craves more special effects and less substance.  A dumbing down if you will.  How many times can you remake Batman?  It appears the answer is there is no end in sight.  The formula for movie success today is the blockbuster.  Ironman, Superman, Spiderman, the Hulk, Transformers and blah blah blah.  I'm sick of the blockbuster movie formula.  Strong tough guy with a tender spot for a hot girl, who kicks ass and together take on the villians.    Most of the movies today lack any real originality, or if they do are shunned by the younger audiance if there is too much emphasis on the character and not enough on the action.  Thank God there is Pixar which still makes family films that attract a large audiance.    This movie did well I'm sure at the box office to attract the intended audiance to make a sequel or two.  Whereas there is more detective work in a Harry Potter film than this film will ever have.  If you really want to know Sherlock Holmes, don't look to the movies.  Pick up the book and read about him and his exploits.  Less hype, more substance.
B003H52Y68|5.0|They are back and the usual suspects are all in play again.  If you thought anyone was officially paired up, it turns out to be not that easy. As usual, Sue the gym teacher steals every scene she is in and is absolutely hilarious. How she got off suspension is her usual exercise in deviousness. Finn and his teacher are both now trying to adjust to life after false pregnancies. Neither of them are about to be fathers although both expected to be. They are not having an easy time of it. Glee Club is facing its next challenge and is once more being threatened with extinction. There is a new character too. A boy who is the lead in a rival glee club comes after Rachel as a love interest and everyone is suspicious that he is trying to thwart their chances.  His teacher makes moves on Will. So all is up in the air. The new guy has an excellent voice and does a marvelous duet with Rachel. Sue, of course, is aware of romance in the air and is going to do her best to use it to destroy Glee Club.  She stages a hilarious intervention for Rachel via a meeting of the Old Maids Club of their high school, encouraging her to date the boy from the rival club.

088619444X|4.0|Simple language and simple plot, but conveys deep emotions about one's insulated life, lived with conscience and dignity, and yet the reflections leave the reader with such sense of loss and then the question, what to do with the remains of the day?
0792164903|2.0|Pros: It has Chris Walken (!).  It has Johnny Depp doing the kind of role he's good at (quirky, eccentric, awkward and off-kilter hero).  It has the kind of spooky, dark, visually-stunning backdrop you expect from Tim Burton, and that you would hope to see in a film for the Sleepy Hollow story.  The costuming is period-appropriate and well-executed.  The action scenes are engaging.    Cons: It has that downs-syndrome-looking blonde (Ricci?), whose performance here can be likened to a piece of wilted lettuce.  The film drags in places with a forced attraction between Ricci and Depp that I don't buy for a second, and most of the acting is entirely unconvincing (let's face it, Depp carries the entire film from start to finish. stumbling whenever Ricci appears, and Walken really doesn't have to do much acting at all so his involvement doesn't count as far as it otherwise might).  It has very little to do with the classics.  Lazy Hollywoodified scriptwriting.    I'll be honest, if it were any other director I might have given another star to the rating.  But I have come to expect much, much more from Burton and yes, I hold his films to a higher standard.  This has to be my least favourite thing he's ever done.  If Walken and Depp weren't involved it would lose a star.  In my opinion, the film is standing on those two actors and the costume/set dressing team talent.    Classic literature snobs and those expecting a Burton epic like Scisssorhands will be sorely disappointed.  People looking to waste a couple of hours on mindless eye candy or who don't care about accuracy or convincing acting will be sated.

B000000OR9|5.0|Whitesnake front man David Coverdale knew a good thing--John Sykes--when he heard one. \\"Whitesnake,\\" the band's eponymously named, multi-platinum smash released in 1987, owes as much if not more to the songwriting/guitar-playing (and back-up vocalizing) of John Sykes as to Coverdale's contributions. After all, part of the reason the CD was so delayed was that Coverdale was having so much trouble singing up to the level of Sykes' music.    Coverdale assuaged his ego by irrationally jettisoning Sykes before the CD was released, and Geffen Records threw Sykes a bone by offering him his own deal. On paper, Geffen got a two-fer, but in reality the strategy may have been to tie Sykes up so he couldn't sign with any other label and really give Whitesnake some competition. Sykes' debut \\"Blue Murder\\" CD is--on many levels--as good as \\"Whitesnake,\\" but it is obvious Geffen's sales reps did NOTHING to leverage one with the other, as would have been the most obvious thing to do.    So get \\"Blue Murder,\\" and hear what might have been. Consider this the true follow-up to the \\"Whitesnake\\"/1987 CD, and don't overlook Blue Murder's sophomore effort--\\"Nothing But Trouble,\\" which is better than ANY subsequent Whitesnake CD.
B00009AOBI|3.0|Buy the original, not the Director's cut.  They changed the music from Bob Seger, which I thought fit the movie perfectly to Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce's music, while I love the songs, did not match the mood of the movie.  I was very disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think this is one of the best shows ever on US television.  I know, that's a big statement.<br /><br />I find most television boring.  Monk was cute, but I'd solve the crime in the first 10 minutes.  Buffy was good, for about the first 3, maybe 4th season.  I love british mysteries, Morse, Foyle, Life on Mars, etc.  Last really great US series was Northern Exposure.<br /><br />Okay, so you see my background.  Not a sci fi fan, did like Trek NG, but hated all the others.  Didn't like Battlestar, Angel, Far whatever or that stupid step thru thing.<br /><br />Firefly, though, I loved.  Only complaint I have about the series is Josh's opinion of what a christian would say in response to objections etc.  Sounds typical thinking of someone who doesn't believe in God trying to sound like they are reasonable in explaining God.  I yelled at the screen first time I saw Jaynesville when the Shepard responded to River.<br /><br />I felt the show has the wit that made early Buffy episodes so good, the action is good, I love the way the captain always gets his butt kicked in fights, (yes, typical unrealistic hollywood fighting), and the relationship between characters.  How wonderful this show might have developed if given a chance (yea, I know there are comic books, but jeez, if you are an adult and reading comic books, get an L tatooed on your forehead).<br /><br />So, in closing, I rank this has a Top Ten All Time Show.  Not quite ahead of Rockford, Taxi or WKRP, but it might be 4th or 5th on the list, in my humble opinion.
0307463745|5.0|The content in this book is distilled down to the essential so you don't have to read a lot of fluff to find the gold. I have read many business books and this probably is the best of all I've read so far. It's no magic formula but more of a collection of good principles. After reading this book I'm more relaxed and running my company is much more fun. It's a great book for reducing stress and increasing happiness and using that to actually build a great company. I feel this book is not just about business, it's about lifestyle and life purpose.

If you've never had a Jeff Beck album start with this one and then go back and explore his others- like the one where Rod Stewart gets his start as asinger.
0670034711|2.0|I can't undertand what all the hype is about this book. It is average and very superficial. Many people of Gilbert's generation have done what she has done, the travelling, the divorce, the ashrams, the search for self awareness - the only difference is she must have had some very good connections in the literary world to get this book published as I am very sure thousands could do better and make it more interesting. Gilbert comes across as very irritating and full of herself. Why are they making a movie of this tripe? Please!! Also she gives seminars now??? There must be a lot of very shallow people out there who would follow this kind of thing as 'inspirational'. It is CHICK LIT, nothing more and nothing less.  Disappointing.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Wonderful BBC series.  We have watched 7 of the 8 episodes so far and love it.  If you like British period pieces you will enjoy this.  The acting is superb!  The characters are people to whom you can relate. The stories are very touching and there is a lesson to be learned.  Deals with all the problems we face today: growing older, raising children alone, being in debt, finding purpose in life, and accepting the course your life has taken. I can't wait to watch the last episode and then get the 2nd season.  Priced a little high on Amazon.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a very interesting and in depth look at the lives of actual soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division during WWII.  While it is somewhat dramatized, it also seems to be a very accurate protrayal of life as a combat soldier in Europe.  The story follows these men from basic training through VE Day.  It certainly highlights the debt Americans owe to this generation of men who stood up for freedom and put everything on the line to protect the USA as well as the world from totalitarianism.  Their sacrifice of time away from home and safety to ensure the freedoms we still enjoy today is a debt we can never repay, yet we must never forget.  Watching these DVDs will remind you that freedom isn't free and it comes at a tremdous personal sacrifice from our military personnel.  If you have any interest in WWII history, this is a \\"must see\\" program and one that I highly recommend.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|There were so many characters in this movie that the whole thing felt cluttered and tedious.  It might have been a very good movie if they had toned everything down a bit and made it more believable.  Plus I thought their alternate ending was more interesting than the one they chose.  This is a movie that I would suggest renting if you want to see it that badly rather than buying it to add to your movie library.  I much preferred \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" as a disaster flick than this one.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these a few weeks ago, and Amazon once again shipped reliably, promptly and communicated professionally.<br /><br />The headphones are light and comfortable, thus easy to forget about as you wear them. Audio quality is superb,be it music or a DVD. I use them on my DVD player via the supplied optical cable - they provide an awesome audio experience.<br /><br />Wall or pole speakers would place the 5.1 or 7.1 (yes, they do reproduce 7.1 surround effects) sound geographically in space with more directional distinction, however the clarity of voice, subtle sounds and even fast-paced dynamic effects if far beyond what can be gained with wall mount speakers from my listening experience.<br /><br />Also, I appreciate my movies LOUD - whereas my neighbours and others, sadly, do not ;)  Now I can use the X41 and listen as loud as I want.<br /><br />The Bass Boost does amplify bass and richness somewhat, but it's not as significant as the name might imply. The fact that dialogue is rich and clear, as are subtle sounds, makes listening to old favourites (songs or music) into a whole new experience. It's like you're hearing it for the first time when new audio effects suddenly enhance the experience.<br /><br />It's a great purchase. Now I need a second one for my PC gaming.
B00005B1W7|5.0|I read Leon Uris's book in the 1970's.  It was so riviting I thought about it for a very long time. I was glad to see a movie made and compelled to view it.  The portrayals by Anthony Hopkins and Ben Gazzara brilliantly brought the characters to life.  For me, watching a good movie more than once does not lose its appeal.  It was exciting  to have found a copy for my library of special movies.
B0037W68F4|1.0|After all the Hype and the long wait the new MGMT album is a complete dud.  I haven't found a single track that has anything to hook me and let this album grow on me.  It's like a completely different group of musicians stole the \\"MGMT\\" name and put out this lump.  I dislike writing negative reviews of anything, especially other people's art, but wow, this is a bummer!!

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD is a must for viewing.  No punches are pulled and they tell it like it is.  The food producers are nothing but legal criminals, with no conscious, and no shame.  This expose should alert all consumers to take action against their politicians and voice their concerns until someone listens.  There are too many lobbyists and lawyers with government connections to the food industry.  Stand up for your rights because it effects the well being of your family and loved one's.

B003H29SFQ|5.0|Three Steps North is a rare gem with a young Lloyd Bridges who is our hero/anti-hero. He emasses a small personal furtune from selling on the black market but he buries it in Italy so he doesn't get caught red handed. But he goes to jail anyway. When he is released, Lloyd returns to Amalfi, Italy, and tries to did it up, virtually every obstacle gets in his way, police, thieves, women, and soon a murder rap. Towards the end I really wanted him to get the money, which actually isn't that much, a few thousand dollars, but itwas the 1950s so I guess it bought more. I won't reveal the surprise ending, but in retrospect, I'm amazed I didn't think of ti. Convict's Code is also a fun film about a guy who is framed for a robberey and sent to jail. While on probation he tries to find the guy that set him up, but he his dogged by his paroll officer who threatens to send him back to prison. Along the way he fall is love with the sister of the guy that framed him. But there's a happy ending. They don't make nice films long this hardly anymore!

This is a wonderful book.
B00136NWNW|5.0|I was slow to accept Roger Waters as a solo act as I felt him most responsible for my favorite bands undoing. I recently downloaded a few of his solo works, desperate for some \\"Floyd\\" sounding music, and can't believe how  \\"Amused\\" totally blew me away.I had almost forgotten how Waters' concepts, music and voice mesh together so perfectly to bring life to his ideas. The sound-scapes he creates fit in impeccably and really bring a familiar Waters style to Amused that should be listened to straight through to be appreciated. Download the lyrics, sit back with some headphones and prepare to experience another fantastically profound and mind- expanding offering from Waters' genius mind.     Hopefully this is not his last concept solo album ...

1439148953|4.0|Having grown up in Brooklyn at time that this story takes place, it brought back memories of a really nice time in life.  The story reflected the behavior and values of that era.

B0033AX26I|1.0|I have been a Chieftan's fan for more years than I care to admit to, and own all of their Albums though after this effort it may be changing. Putting the political message aside (which I think causes some people to rate this album higher than it deserves) the Chieftan's whom I still consider to be brilliant musicians are becoming formulaic. They have made an industry of \\"Let's get some other Genre of music, get some singer/musicians from that genre, stick a couple of fiddles and uilleann pipes behind it and \\"Presto\\" instant album. It's all getting rather predictable, and this has been going on with the Chieftan's for some time. It may be unfair to dump this at the doorstep of this particular album, but I fear the \\"Chieftan's do Hip Hop\\" can't be far away.     The best tune by far on the Album is \\"March to Battle (Across the Rio Grande)\\". However, and I can't believe that I am saying this, it is ruined by a \\"dramatic reading\\" by Liam Neeson. Again, I am a Neeson fan, I would have thought he could read a phone book and I would have enjoyed it, but the poem is absolutely awful (\\"We are the San Paticios a brave and gallant band, there'll be no white flag flying in this green command.\\" C'mon guys, \\"Roses are red, Violets are blue\\" is better). I am not going to bash every performer on the album, but some of the voices of the artists on other tracks are \\"well past their sell by date\\". They have done this on other albums, sometimes that works for nostalgia (Marianne Faithful on \\"The Long Black Veil\\" comes to mind), but here it was more a case of how the mighty have fallen.     Sorry folks, but it is an interesting idea that doesn't deliver and I think the Chieftan's may have \\"Jumped the Shark\\" with this one. Maybe it's time to stop rehashing \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums and \\"Let's shock everyone by combining Irish Music with (fill in blank)\\" albums and recharge themselves (and their fans) by going back to their roots. Again I think some will rate this Album high because of it's apparent social message, but putting politics aside and just using your ears, its not great. When I put on music its the quality of music that important, when I want to revist the history of the San Patricio's I'll read \\"Rogue's March\\".
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This is a silly review for a woman my age, but I had done an equally silly facebook quiz and came up with Second Chance - which was (yes, I'm from California) totally awesome!

B002RAREAK|5.0|I think this is a great album. I've heard the first 10 songs on the album and my favorites are OMG, There goes my baby, monstar, mars v venus, and of course Lil Freak. I need to listen to the last 4 songs, but overall I love the album. Anyone who is considering the album I would say click on the songs on amazon that give you a feeling of each song to determine if you want to buy the cd. This album reminds me of his confessions and 8701 album. I am glad the usher I know is back because his last album Here I stand wasn't all that good to me (maybe it was because he got married. Usher needs to stay single to keep that music and swag going)compared to this album and his past albums. I believe \\"U\\" continues to grow as an artist and this album proved it. Great Album!

0061922315|5.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda's debut novel is glorious gem of a novel that paints an intricate portrait of India, motherhood, and what it means to be a woman. I've read other novels of similar content and style, also dealing with women straddling Indian and American cultures, but this is the first that really, truly spoke to me. As a woman and a daughter and a mother, I could relate to all the main characters, and felt moved by their stories at all times. Even the details that served no purpose other than to more richly highlight the setting and culture of Mumbai were fascinating. The struggle and hopes of the characters in the book, and the contrast of the different subcultures of India were all woven together in a heart-wrenchingly beautiful story.  I drank in every word of \\"Secret Daughter\\" as though it were a mug of Dadimi's perfect steaming chai.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|CARLITO'S WAY (1993), directed by Brian DePalma, is a true modern day gangster masterpiece! I have loved this film ever since I first saw it back in the 90s. It's one of those movies that I would watch over and over again. Even today, I am amazed at how much this film holds up. In a lot of ways, CARLITO'S WAY is one of the most involving of all gangster films because it allows the viewer to get into the thought process of the protagonist Carlito Brigante (played by the great Al Pacino in a vastly underrated performance) through his narration of the tale. Pacino is so convincing and persuasive in the role that the viewer literally feels as if we are going through this character's journey to redemption along with him.<br /><br />In 1975, released 5 years into a 30-year prison sentence, aging, world-weary Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a former New York drug lord of Puerto Rican descent, is determined to go straight and leave his past mistakes and sins behind him. His goal is to make enough money to escape his former life and start a legitimate business in the Bahamas. But along the way, he runs into some of his former colleagues as well as new threats that want to \\"pull him back in\\" and finds that it will be more difficult than he imagined.<br /><br />One of the threats turns out ironically to be Carlito's lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn in a brilliant, Oscar-caliber supporting turn) who manipulated his release from prison on a technicality. While Carlito's story goes in one direction (redemption), Kleinfeld's story goes the opposite as he, on the surface looks clean cut, is shown to really be a coke addict and mob attorney that has stolen a million dollars from one of his clients. The two men's stories work as a superb contrast against one another, but also intersect as Carlito's inability to completely escape his street life and instincts and his blind dedication to Kleinfeld eventually lead to his downfall.<br /><br />During his path to redemption, Carlito seeks outhis former lover Gail (beautiful Penelope Ann Miller in a heartbreaking, sensuous performance), a dancer who works a dead end job at a strip club, but has goals of her own. Carlito convinces Gail that they can start anew and escape their past to have a bright future.<br /><br />In addition to Penn and Miller, the superb supporting cast includes John Leguiziamo (convincing as up and coming thug Benny Blanco who idolizes Carlito), Luiz Guzman (funny as Carlito's right hand man Pachanga), Viggo Mortensen (memorable cameo as Carlito's former gangster colleague and now wheelchair-bound Lalin), Adrian Pasdar (as the son of one of Kleinfeld's mob clients), Ingrid Rogers (as entertainer in Carlito's club), and James Rebhorn (as the district attorney out to nail Kleinfeld). This is one of the rare epic films where I felt that all the supporting cast were perfectly cast and there are no extraneous characters that gum up the works!<br /><br />Pacino essays one of his more complex roles and works in perfect synergy with his supporting cast throughout. But in addition to Pacino's strong performance (which includes his pitch perfect narration), it is DePalma's tight, focused direction that is also a major reason this film holds up so well this many years later. The period detail of the mid 1970s is authentic, yet the film isn't \\"lost\\" in the 70s. That is, DePalma doesn't overdo it with the hairstyles, clothes, etc; the club music is an eclectic choice of good 70s songs (mostly Hispanic obviously) that help set the tone and mood of the club scenes without devolving into parody. And it is such a character-driven story that you almost don't care when it takes place! The cinematography is top notch and about as good as any I've seen in a major film in the modern era. The sad, tragic score works well also as it complements the tragedy of Carlito. The great closing sequence is about as good as one will ever see in any movie: a perfect mix of action, pacing, shots, drama, and music.<br/><br />I have the dvd as part of my collection and whether you are a \\"movie\\" lover or a \\"film\\" lover, either way, CARLITO'S WAY has got you covered!

0439023483|5.0|In a dystopian future North America as we know it has been destroyed and from its ashes rose the Capital and it's 13 Districts. The Capital was powerful and greedy and ruled the districts with an iron fist. When the districts rose up against them the Capital completely destroyed District 13 and subjugated the remaining 12. To keep the Districts in check they force each one to give up one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 17. The children must participate in The Hunger Games, a live televised fight to the death aired for the enjoyment of the residents of the Capital, the Districts are forced to watch in horror as their children are murdered right in front of them.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old who lives in District 12. She has been forced to provide for her family all her life as her father passed away in a mining accident when she was young. Her mother went into a catatonic state of depression afterward leaving Katniss to care for herself and her younger sister alone. Feeling abandoned and alone Katniss ends up drawing on the skills her father taught her: using bow and arrow, foraging and hunting in the forest, and surviving and supporting a family. When her younger sister Prim turns twelve and gets entered into the reaping for The Hunger Games the worst happens. Her little sister is chosen. Katniss sacrifices herself and volunteers in her sister's place. Now she needs to see if her survival skills can transfer from providing for her family to staying alive in the arena as she faces the cruel carnage and inhumanity of The Hunger Games.<br /><br />This book was absolutely riveting. I could not put it down. Every chapter ends on a cliff hanger and in between the plot is kept hopping and everything from the action, to the dialogue, the character development to the back story are written in very neat and tight leaving just enough left over so that you are asking for more. It is the very definition of a page turner.<br /><br />The over arching themes about modern day reality television and violence as entertainment, combined with the dystopian ones of control, power and helplessness in a controlled state added a lot of depth and meaning to the book. At first glance the premise seems impossible but within two chapters you are utterly convinced of the viability and reality of such a world existing. I thought the world building and back story that built up this book were very well done and realistically portrayed.<br /><br />The very premise of the book is one of violence for pleasure, and for a book like that to be done in such a way that still shows respect for the characters lives and the readers who are reading the book, I think, shows true talent. The deaths were handled very tastefully and with true feeling. Everyone's death, from the most helpless child to the most dangerous bloodthirsty opponent on the field, is portrayed in a very compassionate and in some cases touching way.<br /><br />I have been recommending this book to everyone to read. The writing is vivid, fast paced and packs quite a punch. This is one you will read in no time flat but be left thinking about for a long time. If you haven't read it yet, you really need to.

0099481685|4.0|Nora and Luther Krank are sick of celebrating Christmas. Well, Luther is, and he talks Nora into his point of view. They are tired of the crass commercialism, the crowds, the yelling, the stress, and the exorbitant price ($6,100!) of celebrating Christmas. So, when their daughter Blair leaves for a year to join the Peace Corp Luther decides they are going to skip Christmas. And, to talk his wife into it, he sweetens the pot by saying that instead they will save their money and, at half the cost, go on a cruise that sets sail Christmas Day.<br /><br />So while everyone else eats too much turkey, ham, duck and more the Kranks go on a diet. While everyone else is racing around the mall stressing about shopping and gifts and last minute deadlines, the Kranks take naps in tanning booths, preparing for ten long days in the Caribbean sun. While their neighbors decorate and string up lights and lug forty pound light up Frosty's onto their roofs, the Kranks sit back in front of the fire and relax. Their neighbors are shocked and stunned, some outraged, others jealous and consequences soon start to arise. The Kranks soon discover that skipping Christmas might not be so easy to do after all.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I read a John Grisham novel and it took me awhile to get back into the swing of his gruff writing style. This is very much Christmas from a man's point of view. Hence the \\"good idea\\" of trying to skip the whole holiday arising in the first place, I imagine. All of the characters are a little rough around the edges, but that's what makes them more real, more likeable even in some ways. And, the dialog was smart, snappy and, down right Grinch-y. I loved it.<br /><br />I will admit, I almost wasn't sure I was going to like the book right up until the very end. I wasn't sure where he was taking it and it was a bit like watching one of those slapstick comedy movies. The ones where you know the character is going to do the one worst thing they can in a situation and, like watching a train wreck, you almost can't look away as they totally and completely humiliate themselves. That happens. A lot.<br /><br />The neighbors were down right cruel. I almost could not believe the stunts they pulled. But, I understood why by the end, without giving too much away I will say that it will all make sense. And, as I was picturing the humorous scenes that were happening I couldn't help but think this would make a great movie, no surprise, it was made into one!<br /><br />So, Skipping Christmas turned out to be a gruff, male-centric take on Christmas that ultimately had a warm heart and a great ending. The humorous twists and turns, the by turns gruff, pathetic and down right sneaky characters, and the snarky dialogue made this a great and entertaining read. Quick too! One for the husbands, I would say. Though wives will appreciate it too, after all he gets his comeuppance.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|All good things must end. For fans of Doctor Who this was true of the five specials which lead to the end of actor David Tennant's era as theTime Lord known only as the Doctor. Tennant's last five specials represents, in their various ways, what Doctor Who has been since it was revived in 2005: some of the best sci-fi TV in the world.<br /><br />Kicking things off is The Next Doctor. The Doctor arrives in Christmas 1851 London at where he finds his old enemies the Cybermen but also a man claiming to be a future Doctor himself played wonderfully by David Morrisey (of the BBC's version of State Of Play). The fun of this special is watching the two Doctors at work together throughout and the result: a fun filled hour of action and adventure.<br /><br />Next up is Planet of the Dead, costarring Michel Ryan (best known here in the States from the Bionic Woman remake). Here the Doctor and a group of people aboard one of London's double-deck buses are transported to a deserted planet. Soon they discover carnivorous stingray looking aliens bent on turning Earth into their new feeding ground. Planet of the Dead becomes rather predictable quickly though it is saved by the performances of Tennant and Ryan. Thankfully this is the only real dud of the five specials.<br /><br />Waters of Mars, the third special, is one of the finest stories of the New Series. It features what is perhaps Tennant's best performance in the role as the Doctor deals with a crisis on humanity's first Mars colony in 2059. There's fine producton values as well ranging from the truly scary monsters, the realistic colony sets and the ever excellent direction of Graham Harper. Even better is the script by Russel T. Davies and Phil Ford which hits all the right notes of action, horror, suspense and yet asks the question at the heart of any time travel series: if you knew what was to happen and could change it, should you? In short it's a fine example of Doctor Who at its best.<br /><br />Things end in the two part End Of Time. Following on a warning from the Ood, The Doctor races to the present in an attempt to stop the plans of the evil Time Lord The Master. With the help of Donna's venerable grandad Wilf, he finds events unfolding that even he might be unable to stop. Yet there's more going on as former 007 Timothy Dalton appears as the leader of the long thought dead Time Lords, whose return could spell the end of time itself and even the Doctor's own death. End Of Time is an action filled story that is nonetheless peppered with some strong emotional moments for Tennant and company. With all this, End Of Time sends out Tennant's Doctor before the new Doctor  played by Matt Smith steps in next season.<br /><br />With stories that  range across time and space, these five specials represent a good cross section of stories from Doctor Who. There also a nice away to for fans new and old to say good-bye to one Doctor and hello to a new one. So farewell Mr. Tennant, you'll be sorely missed, and welcome aboard Mr. Smith!a warning from the Ood, The Doctor races to the present in an attempt to stop the plans of the evil Time Lord The Master.

0446563048|4.0|QUICK SUMMARY:  Tony Hsieh writes openly about his ups-and-downs in the business world.  Through it all, the reader realizes that CEOs from billion-dollar companies aren't superhumans.  They're people with passion and unusual tenacity to succeed, putting safety behind personal satisfaction.  Strongly recommended especially for college students and young adults!<br /><br />What I LIKED:<br /><br />- Very easy to read.  Tony doesn't use a ghostwriter, but his writing is plain, clear and sometimes rather humourous, too.<br />- Tony writes unabashedly about his successes AND his failures in the business world<br />- To the careful reader, there are key take-away points anyone can apply to their own situation.<br />- I had never heard of [...].  Now I know where to shop for replacement Birkenstock Arizona sandals!<br />- His idea of creating an annually-written \\"Culture Book\\" is a cutting-edge idea for managers at any business.<br />- He offers hope to U.S. businesses that they CAN pursue outstanding customer service AND be profitable, too.  Outstanding customer service *can* be a core competency AND a competitive advantage.<br />- He exemplifies passionate pursuit of his dreams and goals.<br /><br />When I read books, I usually think of a few things that could make the book better.  I really can't think of anything that would further improve Tony's book (if something strikes me later, I'll edit this review).<br /><br />This would be a great book to give to your company's CEO or other chief officer.  Tony's insight into building the right corporate culture is important for the chief officers to consider, since they are the first and foremost drivers of corporate culture.  Middle managers and supervisors will enjoy this book, too, but the ability to affect corporate-wide culture change rests with the CEO (and, sometimes, the HR director/VP).<br /><br />Young adults in college or who have recently entered the business world should read Tony's book to instill in their own hearts a passion to succeed, not a preservation for safety.  As I read Tony's book, the key difference between he and I is I sought after safety in life, and Tony sought after personal satisfaction.  I'd rather be more like him; he wouldn't want to be more like me.<br /><br />BTW, the book I recently read, [[ASIN:0981893597 The Skinny on Success: Why not you?]], would be terrific companion read, since that book lists the attributes of successful people that are exemplified in Tony's life in the business world.<br /><br />Recommended!earts a passion to succeed, not a preservation for safety.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A touching and totally wacky movie!  Floating a house, teaming up with a boyscout, talking dogs?!  The best scenes in my view were when the boyscout is escaping and the villain is looking out the window of his airship and the boyscout, holding baloons, squeaks across the windshield.  Well animated, great and touching plot, great character development.  My family watched in the cinema and I bought this DVD for my Dad.
0061703257|5.0|This book has nearly 600 reviews here, so I will not dig into the book with this review....what would be the point?<br /><br />What I will say is this: Dennis Lehane has written, certainly, one of the very finest books of his career with \\"Shutter Island\\".....deeply probing, twisting, inquiring, shifting, twisting again...etc. This is a truly \\"time well spent\\" read, believe me!<br /><br />In my 62 years as a life-long avid reader, this is only the 3rd time that I had a book \\"get to me\\" and make me so nervous that I \\"couldn't keep reading\\" yet I couldn't \\"stop\\", either! This story, and its characters certainly get under your skin and will \\"put you\\" and \\"keep you\\" on edge...full tilt on this crazy, terrifying, nerve-wrecking roller coaster ride! Just what IS going on here at Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane??? Who ARE these people? Really?.....<br /><br />----<br />Those other two books, btw, were:<br /><br />Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\" (I have never re-read this as I fear that it probably will not be as I \\"remember it was\\".)<br /><br />Peter Straub's \\"Ghost Story\\"  (I think this one, perhaps, was the \\"grand-daddy\\" of all time for me...what a shame they made such a mess of it with the movie.) I remember trying to stop reading, and being unable to do so, and also of getting up and pulling all the shades in my house, etc.<br />----<br /><br />The level that Lehane brings one to in this book is an affirmation of just what a skilled writer he is. With continual introductions of variations on character, its deep and introspective investigation of \\"just what's going on here\\", twisting, turning, interactions and events...naturally occurring or otherwise...just keep turning the screws up another notch until the very last page with its absolutely numbing, mind-shattering conclusion.<br /><br />This book is a MUST READ that you MUST READ....believe me!<br /><br />It is simply shattering...Great Storytelling!<br /><br />~operabruin
B001J4E1D8|4.0|Thomas Hardy's Tess Durbeyfield has had at least three film reincarnations in the last thirty years.  All of the women portraying this woebegone heroine are beautiful--Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's feature film \\"[[ASIN:B0002O7XVI Tess (Special Edition)]],\\" Justine Waddell ([[ASIN:B00003CXSD Dracula 2000]]) in the 1998 BBC production for television ([[ASIN:B000089QEM Tess of the d'Urbervilles]])  and now former Bond girl Gemma Arterton ([[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]]) in this latest 212 minute version in four parts.  One thing for certain, all three of these women know exactly how to eat a strawberry with all the innocence and inadvertent provocation that would surely drive any man--from any century, repressed or not--mad with desire.<br /><br />Not since Nastassja Kinski has an actress depicted such naïve sensuality, as does Gemma Arterton as the ill-fated Tess.  Even without speaking, Arterton epitomizes vulnerable femininity with her lovely porcelain complexion set off by long tresses of dark brown hair, punctuated by full red lips and warmed by the fathomless brown eyes of a doe. Yet this reliance on the physical to embody the spirit of Tess by no means suggests that Arterton's performance is vacuous.  Perhaps her youth, like that of the character she is portraying, works in her favor--but it is her ability to bring to the surface that quality of sweet innocence that puts her in almost the same category as the alluring girl-woman Kinski.<br /><br />Waddell's Tess, although beautiful in another way--remember her portrayal as Estella in [[ASIN:B0002XVRGG Great Expectations (Masterpiece Theatre, 1999)]], seems feistier, more knowing and less susceptible to the wiles of the mesmerized yet confused men in her life.  Perhaps, her eyes do not convey the same wonder at the dualities of the world.  Waddell's Tess already seems primly aggrieved by the trials and tribulations of her life; her face reflects her accrued experience.<br /><br />Similarly, the other actors in this ensemble will work or not work for you depending on the extent of your familiarity with and expectations of Thomas Hardy's characterizations.  If you like your Tess sweet, vulnerable and undeniably attractive, then Arterton will amply fill the bill. Hans Matheson, as the despicable Alex Stokes-D'Urberville (black-hearted misunderstood Mordred in [[ASIN:B00005QW5Y The Mists of Avalon]]) undeniably personifies the dastardly qualities of the villain with a sneering, not at all self-deprecating, self-acceptance and `who cares?' arrogance that seems true to type.  However, this reviewer found his reappearance and reinsertion in Tess's life a little hurried.  Indeed, the audience understands the feeling of obligation that Tess once felt for her family at the opportunistic prodding of her mother, but I didn't think this sense of resignation was adequately portrayed simply because it was allotted little screen time.  On the other hand, the behind the scenes glimpse through the keyhole of the boardinghouse as Alex and Tess argue as seen through the eyes of landlady, Mrs. Brooks spectacularly depicts the depravity of the cruel life Tess reluctantly endures with Alex.<br /><br />The role of Angel Clare played by Eddie Redmayne ([[ASIN:B001URA5Y8 POWDER BLUE]], [[ASIN:B0012QE4Q2 The Other Boleyn Girl]]) at first seems miscast.  However, his innocent scenes of love with Arterton's Tess, are bucolic to behold.  Filmed against lush fields and mooing cows, the audience sees and enjoys the purity and magnetism of the halcyon days of first love.  In contrast, Angel's hypocritical withdrawal from what could have been a wonderful life of committed sharing in another part of the world appears all the more marked as does the increased emotional release Redmayne's character must expel as he ricochets from feelings of impending doom and the simple joy of being at long last with the woman that he loves.  Redmayne's oddly shaped face showcases a boy becoming a man--possessing thesame brand of innocence as his Tess.  His struggles to be of the world and above the world mature him yet do not defeat him.<br /><br />Other characters of note in this production are Tess's three milkmaid friends and the heartlessly cruel Groby (Christopher Fairbank) whose mere presence had this reviewer shuddering in trepidation each time he appeared on the screen.  In addition, Ruth Jones, as Tess's subtly scheming mother, portrays with distinction a conniving opportunist willing to use her daughter to gain financial happiness.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The 2008 BBC presentation of Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" successfully conveys the storyline and emotional impact of an impoverished woman's plight in the late 19th century.  Gemma Arterton looks as if she could walk right out of a Monet painting; her beauty palpably represents the innocent insouciance of Hardy's Tess--a girl child in a woman's body.  Her male leads do not overpower her, but set off her desire for love and her innate naivety from both ends of the spiritual spectrum.  Viewers who have not read the novel be cautioned that all ends badly despite the audience's best and most hopeful wishes.  Recommended to all lovers of the Masterpiece Theatre genre as a faithful adaptation of Hardy's classic tragedy.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"as his Tess.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I like this little headphone amp.  It was cheap, and it gives you a little extra boom.  What's not to like?  I use it for dual use.  I hook it up to my Sansa Clip+ MP3 player, while I'm running.  I also use it for my headphones at work because my Dell E6500 just doesn't put out enough sound to drown out the ambiance of work.  The Fiio amp does the trick.  Given the fact that I use it a lot at my computer, I like the fact that it charges with USB; that's handy.  I just leave it plugged into USB and turned on all day.  If you're thinking about getting the cheaper Fiio that uses a AAA battery, don't bother.  Shell out a couple extra bucks and get the one with USB; you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />Negatives: Some of the reviews said there's some noise at low volume.  They would be right.  But you really can't tell when the music is playing.  Or, just unplug it if you aren't going to crank the music.  Some reviewers commented on the dynamic bass boost: I agree it's not overwhelming, but it's okay.  Bottom line, if you are an audiophile (I'm not), I bet this won't be good enough for you.  You might need to go to a better solution.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  However, I think 90% of people would be happy with this, given the price, size, and volume.  It's great!
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Suburban San Diego, 2006: Micah and Katie are two well-to-do suburbanites who, cosmetically at least, seem to be living the idyllic life of two young lovers in a palatial San Diego house. But Micah and Katie have a problem. Something oddly disquieting appears to have invaded their home. It bangs doors, causes the stairs to creak and makes alarming noises in the middle of the night. Being of a somewhat pugnacious nature, Micah decides to document the phenomenon using a Hi-Def video camera in the hope of getting to the bottom of what is going on - and thanks to his tenacious documentation over the course of twenty one nights during September and October, the viewer is treated to a first-hand account of what happens next.    The first-hand docudrama is by now a well worn trope of the horror genre. Films like [[ASIN:B000G296X4 The Legend of Boggy Creek]] and [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] have attempted to blur the lines of horror and fact by embracing improvised performances and verite style shooting for going on nearly forty years now. When they're done well (as in the case of \\"Blair Witch\\" and BBC TV's [[ASIN:B00007JGG0 Ghostwatch [Region 2]]]) they can be genuinely spine-tingling and when they're done badly (as in the case of the execrable [[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead]]) they can be amongst the most painfully awful viewing experiences that one ever has to endure.     \\"Paranormal Activity\\" sits somewhere in the middle of these two extremes - its not a terrible documentary horror film, but it's not a particularly good one either.     Why is this?     Well, largely, because establishing and then maintaining the balance of a documentary horror movie effectively is a very difficult thing to achieve, and director Oren Peli doesn't quite make the grade for a variety of reasons. Chief amongst them is the fact that his two leads don't quite possess the acting chops to carry off the movie; a film like this is either made or broken by it's actors and unfortunately Micha Sloat and Katie Featherstone never really sell the reality of the situation convincingly. The other major failing of the film is it's plotting and pacing. Frankly it all feels a bit too ad hoc and make-shift for it's own good: characters appear and reappear to no discernible effect other than to ham-fistedly suggest a portentous air of ominous foreboding; scenes feel thrown in for the sake of expediency rather than narrative or character progression (the \\"let's conveniently leave the house so that the Ouija board can ignite\\" scene was, frankly, ridiculously contrived. Given Katie's repeatedly vocalised dislike of the board, wouldn't it have been far more effective - and believable in terms of the character - if she'd thrown it out as the couple were heading out of the house only to find that it had reappeared inside the house upon their return?); back-story which is set-up in the beginning is never elaborated upon to the point that one is mystified by it's inclusion and the twists and turns of the plot are strictly by the numbers.    So what are we left with at the end of the day? Well, largely, a film which feels like a series of warmed-over docuhorror clichés or a vastly inferior TV movie based on the haunting/possession methodology expounded upon in Gerald Brittle's book [[ASIN:0595246184 The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren]] (which, if you want to experience genuine chills, I recommend you pick up - hell, I'm a paranormal skeptic and an agnostic and yet it scared me so much when I first encountered it that I refused to read it after dark). Sure, the much applauded final scene is moderately effective, but even that when you look at it is merely just a combination of the famous \\"ghostcam\\" e-mail attachment, that did the rounds on the internet a few years ago, as well as scenes from \\"Ringu\\" and [[ASIN:B0028DRGDQ [Rec]]].    Ultimately \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is a film that doesn't live up the hype. It's worth the price of a rental if you can pick it up for a few bucks, but don't expect anything like the chill-fest that the critics rave about on the front cover.

B000001GEM|5.0|This is a masterwork by Johannes Brahms. His greatest work if you look at the dimension and magnitude.The death of Robert Schumann inspired him to write this. It was a way of giving condolence to those who remain behind on earth after their dead have passed on. Brahms intended this work as a celebration of all humanity even in the face of inevitable death. Brahms claimed that he could have named this his 'Human Requiem'with its focus on comforting the living. The music really comforts whilst still acknowledging the tragedy of death.<br />The word 'Requiem' usually refers to the Roman Catholic Mass for the Dead which begins with the Latin phrase, 'Requiem Aeternam Dona Eis Domine' (Grant them eternal rest, O Lord!). Brahms conceived the extra-ordinary idea of creating his own text selecting Biblical passages that do not correspond to the funereal liturgy of any church.<br />Brahms gives a sombre colour to the first movement by omitting the violins, piccolo, clarinets and timpani entirely and by subdividing the violas and cellos culminating with the utterance of 'selig' (Blessed) to close the movement with harp accompaniment. The second movement begins with a slow march passage in triple meter. The violins enter for the first time and in a high register. The timpani quietly sounds out ominous triplets. The chorus sings in unison first softly then in full voice as the march theme is repeated. This is the music that Brahms had originally composed for and then removed from his early D Minor Symphony. One movement came here and the other three went to the Piano Concerto No. 1. The baritone solo begins the third movement in a dialogue with the chorus. This is a haunting movement. The fourth movement is harmonically in a new world. It is a gentle middle section to the whole work representing sublime tranquillity. The fifth movement brings out the soprano and the contrast to the third movement is striking. The baritone earlier represents grief, doubt and despair. Here, the soprano sings of consolation. The opening of the sixth movement reverts to the uncertainty of the third in harmonic progressions that accompany the baritone's description of the mystery to come, the harmonies ranging from C Minor to F Sharp Minor. Three trombones and tuba announce the great moment.The excitement is extended into a powerful fugue in C Major. A Stretto leads to a final and forceful statement. The final movement is like the first. The basic thematic cell is in double bass and cellos. The sombre orchestral colours of the opening are replaced by reinstatement by the clarinets, the second pair of horns and the violins. The final section of the movement is a magical reworking of material from the opening movement. There is a return to the home key of F Major as the sopranos soar to a brilliant high A Major just like at the end of the first movement. The harps enter and rise to an ethereal conclusion over the final choral murmurs of 'selig' (blessed).<br />The definitive reading has come from Herbert Von Karajan and the Wiener Philharmoniker in 1985. Other recommended readings are : Fritz Lehmann/Berliner Philharmoniker; Daniel Barenboim/London Philharmonic; Robert Shaw/Atlanta Symphony; Otto Klemperer/Philharmonia Orchestra; Sir Georg Solti/Chicago Symphony; Sir Simon Rattle/ Berliner Philharmoniker.sings of consolation.

B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Just a short review as everything that could be said has probably been written already.  For all its purported choppiness, I quite liked the original, shorter release of this film, found the script and performances to be stellar in spite of the \\"choppiness\\" (like how Bloom becomes a great sword fighter with what seems to be little training).  So I was very intrigued by the reports that THIS is the version to watch, and as the director comments in this version, this isn't a release just for his own gratification, but bluntly points out he wasn't happy with the edits that were made - and if people think some parts are slow, this is where the story all ties together (including the fact that the main character had served as a soldier in the past).  I agree there are a few \\"slow\\" parts, but there is nothing to lose your interest and there is nothing here that does not further the story - nothing is thrown in for the sake of it. Also, there are no bloated cringe-filled melodramatics as I found in Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot\\", for instance, that I found irritating.     A classy, intelligent, well done film, perfectly cast, and if Orlando Bloom doesn't QUITE have the force of personality that can completely pull off a big inspirational speech, he is perfect at quiet grim determination, snarky comments, and struggling with pain and guilt, or when put into an awkward situation.  Just loved Eva Green in this - she is perfect.  Scott's cinematography and spectacular battle scenes succeed in just the right ways - you can feel the desert sand in your face.  I think this film never got the credit it deserves - one critic bemoaned (when this movie was released) how Scott somehow watered down the Christian/Muslim strain - but personally, as a historical film, what was Scott supposed to do? Depict terrorist attacks?  I think this film accurately depicts those who strove to live together in the Holy City, as well as the fanatical greedy element of the Crusades - pays respect to history.If you never saw the \\"short\\" version this one is worth the price.  Only thing, if there was supposed to be some sort of accompanying booklet in the box, mine was missing it - I could complain but how often am I going to read a booklet anyway.

B002LC8HF0|5.0|From the moment I set down Sanderson's The Well of Ascension, I felt compelled to pick up The Hero of Ages.  As I read through it, I was astounded time and time again by the genius crafted within the book.  Even though I read the epilogue almost a year before reading the book itself, I was amazed continually at the foresight and character development constantly revealed.  Sanderson's plot twists kept me on my toes, wondering what could possibly come next.  He manipulated aspects of the world within the series that I hadn't realized were even remotely connected, and gradually revealed more about them until they overlapped each other perfectly.  The characters and plot exceeded my expectations several times over.  I particularly enjoy visiting Sanderson's website, where he provides chapter-by-chapter annotations for several of his books, including his Mistborn Trilogy.  I enjoy the extra insight that such additional details add.  They allow readers to enjoy the behind-the-stage details that Sanderson never explicitly gives within the novel.  I thought the book was a masterpiece of writing, and I came to believe that Kelsier summed up Sanderson's writing style quite well in the first book, Mistborn: The Final Empire.  \\"Plots behind plots, plans beyond plans.\\"  As Sanderson wrote in my brother's copy of The Final Empire, \\"There's always another secret.\\"  All in all, The Hero of Ages provided an excellent ending to an exciting trilogy.  It was an extremely satisfying read.  Reading it felt like scratching an old, neglected itch I'd forgotten about.

For many, this movie is in a different language, showing a different culture and a different approach to death but it is the universal language of beauty and humanness.  If this movie was expressed through a stone letter; it would be an ordinary yet magnificent and beautiful stone. A stone that expresses roughness, smoothness, grief, joy, strength, pain, accepting and letting go.  It is like holding your own stone, facing the ocean and going on a journey that is through death that leads to life

0345495004|5.0|LOVING FRANK was much more than I expected.  It had beautiful character development, and was finly crafted.  I believe it was a first novel--WHAT A BEAUTIFUL JOB!!!  And, the ending was stunning.  Even if you aren't interested in Frank Lloyd Wright, it's a great read.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|This graphically revamped version of the television series Evangelion Neon Genesis is beautiful.  Certain things were left out to cut down on time.  But it maintains the integrity of the old show.  There are Doritos in this one.  One critique that I have though is that Rei's smile isn't as touching as it was in the series.  Other than that I loved it.  And my copy was new so I have had no problems with it.
B0038P59A0|5.0|OMG, I loved this film. The screen writer is a genius!!! It is a jaw-dropping, exciting rollercoaster ride with twists no one could predict! Robert is incredible and Jude outstanding, Irene a little disappointing I would have used a drop dead gorgeous actress in her stead, but that is just a personal preference. Bottom line:<br />YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS! If you don't love it check your pulse I certain you died some time ago.

0375846735|3.0|On the plus side: TAS has some wonderful ideas and wonderfully written passages.  At moments, it calls to mind the first book in Pullman's trilogy.  On the downside: like it's immediate predecessor, TAS is heavy on the action and scene-cutting, and disappointingly light on the character development.  Pullman tries very hard to invoke the poignancy of youth and old age, life and death.  When he treats of large themes on the scale of worlds, he does so with a deft -- and compelling -- enough touch.  But so much of HDM, which should be so much more powerful than it is, is about how such themes play out in the lives of a tiny handful of individuals.  Fine enough.  Yet, for all the many many interesting and unexpected and shocking and tragic things that happen around and to these individuals -- Lyra and crew -- they, themselves, rarely rise above the level of cutouts.  Great story-telling doesn't require ceaseless twists and turns; what it needs most of all are characters the reader cares about.  For me, book 1 of HDM had such characters.  Books 2 and 3 lost them.  By the time I reached the end of HDM I was quite ready to move on.
B000005H7D|5.0|Blue Train is an excellent place to start if you want to experience the musical magic of John Coltrane. It's not as demanding as A Love Supreme, or Giant Steps. All the tunes on Blue Train are smooth as silk, with Coltrane's exquisite playing there to guide you along the way.          All of the back-up musicians Coltrane had with him did a magnificent job as well. Kenny Drew on piano is an excellent example of this, along with Lee Morgan on trumpet, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.          There's two alternate takes on this disc for the songs Blue Train and Lazy Bird,both just as mesmerizing to listen to as the originals. This Rudy Van Gelder edition has marvelous sound, and I would suggest buying it on that fact alone. The alternate takes are good, but there's only those two.          If you're just starting a Coltrane collection, Blue Train's the place start. After this I would move onto My Favorite Things, Giant Steps, A Love Supreme and Crescent. After those, the rest of the Coltrane universe is yours to explore-and what a universe of sounds the man left us with.          The best song on here that displays the mystical quality of Coltrane's playing, is on the title track, Blue Train. His playing on that song is like listening to music from another world.          I think it's hard to describe Jazz in terms of description and feeling, because the music causes floods of them to enter your mind. I like reviews that can match a mood to the album so you can get a better understanding of it. Blue Train definitely has a nighttime mood that a lot of great Jazz recordings possess.          When it's late at night, and you have some time to kick back with some music, throw on Blue Train and let the real Trane take your mind far, far away.
