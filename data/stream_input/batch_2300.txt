144472889X|5.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old granddaughter. She could not stop reading it!  Watching her facial expressions as she read was evidence to me that the book was captivating.  She told me she did not want the book to end so she decided that she would read it real slow.  Can't wait until the next one comes out in May.  She is marking the calendar, as we have already pre-ordered.

B00BRUYQFC|3.0|Buy Mirrors and Suit and tie separately, the rest of the album sounds like \\"ooooooo guhrrrrlllllll\\" R&B.  I suggest you preview the other songs before paying for the whole album.  Also, all of the songs are basically like two songs, the one beat stops and the next beat starts but its still the same song.  Strange.  Wonder if that's a Timbaland thing.

0938045768|5.0|When I was looking for some kind of way to improve my pushups and pull-ups, I was referred to this book, after, reviewing the comments I decided to purchase the book.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|Great page turner, glad I picked it up, or um, downloaded it.  Looking forward to reading the next Russinovich novel.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Excellent docudrama! A good watch from a very good director, Mr. Ben Affleck.  There was a bit of embellishment to add to the suspense in the movie compared to the historical facts but it only added to the screenplay and didn't subtract from the visual experience.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very cool I love how u get to build up your city and namely you get to control the cars and stuff but I just love this game
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Heartbreaking detail of the action he saw and watched his fellow brothers die! This book is a most read for any military buff and RIP to the warriors who died saving us! A very good book!!

B00A757EFW|5.0|This was my favorite game growing up and I am glad I can play it again! It is great to pass the time!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Very inspiring and peppered with bits of humor. The acting was genuinely first rate from the starring roles to the supporting cast.

B006LSZECO|5.0|GONE GIRL KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT UNTIL YOU FINISH. IT IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS  YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN. GONE GIRL I THINK REPRESENTS TO ALL MEN THE WOMEN WHO LEFT THEIR LIFE AND THEREFORE CREATS AN INTEREST BY TITLE.
1416550534|4.0|This novel was Kate Morton's first novel, and one can tell she had not perfected her craft. However, she has a beautiful style of writing that I find wonderfully engaging. The areas that I find distracting, especially in this novel, are her tendency to heavy-handed foreshadowing and the names she picks for her characters. (Jemima, Ursula and Gytha - really?!?!)<br /><br />The story's central character is Grace, who we are introduced to when she is in her late 90s and in a nursing home. She is approached by young woman producing a documentary about about mysterious murder that occurred at an old English manor house called \\"Riverton.\\" Grace had worked at Riverton as maid in her teens and was there during this mysterious murder, and agrees to meet with the young woman in the hopes of providing accurate details of the period. Yet, Grace knows a secret about that event, and remains to be seen whether she will reveal it.<br /><br />One can tell easily the author was most likely heavily influenced by many novels and/or movies in writing this. It has been stated that Kate Morton is intrigued with Gothic novels, and that is reflected here. But it is also easy to see shades of \\"Rebecca,\\" \\"Titanic,\\" and \\"Upstairs/Downstairs.\\" Some might say the author \\"stole\\" these ideas. I'm not so sure. The tales told in these 3 stories are not all that original, and they are stories that are timeless. That the author was influenced is easy to see, and because I enjoyed 2 of the 3 (I've never seen \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\"), I can appreciate the effort.<br /><br />I do enjoy Kate Morton's writing. I believe she has a way with words and descriptions of places and people. I felt as though I was in the era and in a large English manor house, experiencing the sharp difference between staff and family. Grace is more than a little difficult to define - she is not easily read - and that was frustrating as I read the novel. However, the more I read, the more clear it became as to what and how her personality was defined by her experiences. While I believe most of us want to truly like and relate to the protagonists in the stories we read, sometimes those individuals come with faults. A good author will never make their protagonist a perfect person. Grace was like that to me - she could be endearing and pleasant, but she had a bit of sharpness to her.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel very much. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the author had not figured out the art of foreshadowing and that bothered me. It's okay to give a reader subtle hints to have them attempt to figure something out. It's quite another to figuratively hit them over the head with a sledge hammer to make your point. I also really dislike some of the names she chooses for her characters. I dislike them so much, I find them distracting. It's okay to use a common name such as Ann, Mary,Elizabeth. Character names don't always have to the weird and way out.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I am a female who is attracted to males, so I really liked this movie. It wasn't as corny as I expected either and actually has a decent story line which was a pleasant surprise.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|My son enjoys playing this from time to time. Not as popular as the other games we have downloaded for him.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|not as good as knocked up but has same emotional and comedic combination. The little girls are still hilarious. Overall a really good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son really enjoys this game and so do all of his friends. Something for him to do when we are driving long distances in the car.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very nice....kinda sad it's over..:(  was a satisfying finale to the trilogy can't wait for the movie!  Kudos to E L James
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Definitely suggest this for anyone. Keeps me up to date on local weather alerts and works well on my phone.
B003M5AXN4|4.0|First of all,this movie is highly entertaining AND highly underrated. I only gave it 4 stars because the audio wasn't what I was hoping for considering the great car sequences. Audio isn't bad,it just wasn't great. Visually this movie is beautiful. The vibrant colors and creative sets. Comes off real sharp in blu-ray format. Initially,I didn't think there were enough special features. Wrong. The special features are very meaty. Lots of content and fun information about the movie.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love playing this when I have some down time in the evening. Good mindless fun when you don't feel like doing anything else.
B009K916ZK|5.0|No problems with this device.  It was to important to me to trust if off brands would work.  I paid for an Apple and I wanted the value of the real apple Display Port.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a family childhood favorite of mine, and it was a perfect stocking stuffer from my husband! Great buy!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The books instantly downloaded and are very user-friendly on my I-pad via Kindle link.  Anyone who likes cars and is in love with their dog needs to read this one.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Please read this book. Read it twice and keep relishing the experiments inside again and again. You will learn a lot about human behaviour. You will learn a lot about the subconscious functioning of the brain. There is no scientific jargon here, just one after another slam dunk short chapters illustrating how humans behave and that most of us don't even realize why we do !. ( and that is the number one reason why we haven't exited the gene pool ).<br /><br />The central idea of the book is that while we are extremely fine tuned to assess threats and opportunities (threats much more than opportunities ) and respond quickly and effectively, its worth being cautious at times particularly when we are doing things like forming judgements, answering difficult questions, trying to predict, etc...  ( i.e.any non basic tasks ).<br /><br />As a side note let me tell you all that HR &#34;bu***it&#34; about suspending judgement is almost impossible to do. Evolution has worked millions of years so you don't suspend judgement when you see a lion and hence live on to reproduce.......<br /><br />I read the book and tried training myself to ignore some of the basic fallacies the author talks about ( he calls this part of the brain , System 1 ) and  honestly I don't know if I succeeded or even tried , because you don't even know when System 1 is engaging( talk about self awareness ! ). To make it more difficult evolution hasn't prepared you for high intensity thinking for long periods ( the author calls this System 2 ) , I know you don't believe me but try googling  'Add-3 Kahneman' , and you will know your limits real soon.<br /><br />So you don't know when System 1 is working and you can't engage System 2 for long, its lazy and needs intense focus even to keep up, cause 1 takes over at the slightest slip, and before you know you are on subconscious auto pilot....<br /><br />To end it before I tell you all the stories , buy the book and read it to at-least appreciate the complexity of the psychology of humans. if you are able to take advantage of the tips that's a massive bonus.<br /><br />Enjoyof the psychology of humans. if you are able to take advantage of the tips that's a massive bonus.<br /><br />Enjoy
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Just started it but I'm sure it will be equally satisfactory on my I-pad via Kindle link as other recent books.  I'm new to this but really like it.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|expecting something different<br />also wondered about the animals-zebra and what PETA thought about it.<br />graphics were great.  You need to really pay attention to the ending because it answers a lot of questions to the movie.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is pretty good. It's fun. I am on level 4. My first game got deleted or I would be on level 22 or 23!
0152164154|5.0|This book was, and always will be one of my top favorites. I first read it when in my late teens, and studied it in college, but eventually that copy was lost, so I was delighted to find it again on Amazon - and in French, with original illustrations! - and reacquaint myself with its simple profundity that brought back the same feelings of awe and fascination that I remembered from decades ago.
B00BESM14U|1.0|I thought this would be a good movie based on the reviews I had seen, but I couldn't even finish it. It was dark - visually and metaphorically. It was boring, and I didn't like Emma Watson as a wild and rebellious teen. I wasted $4 renting this movie.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I .order these for my Kindle and I appreciate the ease and speed of the downloads.  I will continue purchasing
B009YX02T8|4.0|I bought this on the Amazon Deal of the Day and I honestly wouldn't have bought this myself. I did enjoy the music but the track with Green Day could have gone without. I don't remember this song in the movie just enjoyed the songs I heard in the movie itself.  Otherwise it was pretty decent.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I order these for my Kindle and I really like the ease and speed of getting these applications.  Thank you
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I was waiting a long time~ It is really good!! Specially hopping eggs are soooooooooooo cute!! I really really love it~!!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This is an amazing story, but beyond just the fascination with fraudulent identities there is a sadness to the story.<br />It is well worth watching.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The foster care system in the U.S. is shameful if there is any truth to this novel (and I believe that there is). A beautiful story of forgiveness, redemption and love. Flowers and their meanings, their language are fascinating.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie has everything going for it. The script is fantastic, designs are great, there's humor for all ages and there are plenty of pleasant surprises in the plot to keep it interesting. I could watch this movie over and over, it was greatly written and directed!
B00991TCOG|5.0|It's Lindsey Stirling, there's really no other thing to say! Except that it's amazing, beautiful, unique, and again it's Lindsey Stirling.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|People who go to see this expecting it to be a remake of the original with Arnold will be in for a surprise.  That's not to say it's bad.  In fact, it's just the opposite, this is a great movie in its own right!
B0016BWACI|4.0|Classic and marvelous to watch the story unfold. Amazing what they achieved here visually. This is one to have and view on an afternoon revisit to youth.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Bought this for my bf for Christmas and he loves it.  We watched it in surround the first time we watched it and it was amazing!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Great story. Wonderful delivery and performances. The pacing was marvelous. It's a true delight to view and revisit this in Blue Ray!
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|I have been listening to the Strokes for years now and am happy to say that Comedown Machine was a great album. I still believe that &#34;Is This It&#34; is their best album, but Comedown Machine is not too far behind.<br /><br />My favorite tracks so far are:<br /><br />Tap Out<br />Welcome to Japan<br />80's Comedown Machine<br />and All the Time<br /><br />Now if only they would go on tour...
B003VANOFY|5.0|only works on the computer... but its quality is amazing... you can hear anything on these... would suggest for computer players.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|As a long time Van fan, I'm not too impartial here. But this is one of Van's better efforts of late and certainly worth the investment of time and money.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|I don't know how much of this book was actually written by Crichton but it sure doesn't read like one of his books. no mystery, no subtleties, like comparing imitation vanilla extract to using  a vanilla bean. very disappointing. RIP Michael Crichton, we miss you more than ever.
B00178JDCK|2.0|So I should start off this review by saying that I did an ENORMOUS amount of research for this purchase. Bradford Cox's use of the pedal initially caught my attention and I have been planning on buying this pedal ever since for over a year now and just finally made my purchase a week ago.<br /><br />I should put a big preface over this review: I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Many effects<br />Great Paramaters<br />Dual Input<br />Trails Option<br />Blue LED<br />Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />Pretty bad sound<br />Knobs Almost Impossible to fiddle with<br />Space Feature overrated.<br />Low End Lacking<br /><br />The pedal offered some pretty neat features that I really was looking for: a true Mix/Blend, Decay, Time, and Tone knob. It seemed to have everything I needed.  I particularly wanted the blend knob because I really wanted to mix and record with this pedal through my Tascam recorders' effect sends.  The pedal also seemed to have a pretty cool array of effects that would help me in my playing.<br /><br />I planned on rehousing the pedal so I wasn't too disappointed by the build quality, which is pretty terrible, but once I plugged in the pedal, I could tell pretty quickly that it was no good.  The sound of the reverb is very tinny, and pretty poor sounding.  I've only had the pedal for a little bit, but it seems to be lacking the full bass response that most of my other /extremely/ crappy pedals worked so wonderfully  for.  The sound just wasn't cutting it for me.  I tried fiddling with the tone knob but didn't get anything worthwhile.  The space feature was especially disappointing, and didn't really have much of a shimmer to it, rather just a really poorly pitch shifted echo.  The knobs are so skinny that the pedal is almost impossible to work with, so no editing with your feet is possible.<br /><br />I am not convinced that reverb is one of those \\"you get what you pay for\\" sort of deals, so I'm still looking, but if you're very picky about your reverb, I wouldn't choose this pedal.<br /><br />If anybody has any questions, feel free to get in contact with me about it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|If this free version is so good I can't wait until I can start payin for some  of the apps that are available on the Kindle Fire!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A delicate story, a hero's  journey, a deep metaphor for the treacherous, seemingly impossible challenges of life.  Fall in love with the tiger!  Feel the courage and tenacity of Pi.  Beautiful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game out there in my opinion. It's a very good way to kill some time. I do wish they would come up with a different sequence of how the trains appear.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is so great and entertaining my 18 month son loves it . It has alot of singing and vivid colors .
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|The price was reasonable and the movie was packaged and new, as advertised.  Keira Knightley is one of my favorite actresses... Jude Law isn't bad either... ;)
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I loved it and it was a great price . Disney movies are so expensive now so this was a steal
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first Colleen Hoover novel I have read, and I loved it! Sky is a very real and relatable character. I don't want to give any of the plot away, but read this book!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|As soon as I heard Grand Daddy's Gun I had to send it with a Amazon Gift Cert download to my kids and grandkids.  Smiled and cried thru the whole song.
B000FC2NGM|4.0|Didn't see it coming in the least!  Just relied the rest of my review was one long spoiler, so I will stop now.  Surprising ending.
B008ROGZUU|5.0|One of the best renditions of tosca I have seen . Angela is superb on this role .  I always enjoy hearing her sing.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I really like this app better than Temple Run because of the scenery & options I just wish it had more of a tutorial of the extra powers.
B002GYS1FO|3.0|some of the tracks are really great but some of them are pretty weak. Worth listening first to make sure you like it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle book is my kind of book.  I admire what he did for our Country and for Freedom!  It's a shame his life had to end the way it did and after all he had been through.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Solid entertainment, runs fairly smoothly, and worthwhile for the price. Occasionally. redundant and annoying,  but engaging storyline that keeps one's attention until the conclusion.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good surprising ending!excellent book. Kept u guessing right until the end. Good nursery mystery that keeps u wanting more and keeps u reading
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I initially bought this game for my 6 and 7.year old boys to play.  I had no idea I was going to be more addicted to it than they were!  We really enjoy playing together.  Deciding what pirates to buy and where to build our pirate huts and naval fortresses.  However beware!  To accomplish all the levels and get the gold dabloons necessary takes time. Make this game about the journey, not the destination and you will have a ball.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Sometimes it's hard to decide which group we like more, the Celtic Women or Celtic Thunder.  Either way, beautiful voices and great song variety.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Honestly either you are going to love it or just not care! I personally think it is a very intriguing show. That's all that I need to say!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Love the voices and the variety of songs, although we'd still really love to see the Celtic Women and Celtic Thunder present more traditionally Irish selections.
B0010SB6OK|5.0|Loved the characters, the sorry is compelling and beautiful. A novel, hard science approach to alternate histories and all the more fun for it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Solid graphics on HD version. Fun searching and completing the quests. Looks like it will be a great game for casual play.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|this movie is great, just like all the others. it's super funny and brings back memories of childhood. cute dry witty rom com.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|it was a very interesting book, but left me wanting more, I was disappointed  when it came to an end,  like a cliff hanger, but I suppose if you get more of the series you would feel complete about the story line. well written and good story line.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and I think Jim Carrey (and everyone else) did a fantastic job. Definitely a Holiday classic around my house!
B000FA675C|5.0|Good liked it nice information simple easy to follow good good good good why write more it was good ok
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is by far my new favorite movie. The music was fantastic, most of the acting was very good and it was just a fun movie overall!
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|Good liked it nice information simple easy to follow good good good good why write more it was good ok
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Such a beautiful movie based on a beautiful book that millions upon millions of people have fallen in love with over the years.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great book. Better then the tv series. Had a lot more detail. Described characters different from what they are on the show.
B003L77G06|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. The writing is quick, witty and hilarious, the acting is fantastic and it's just one of those shows that even though it can be a bit out there sometimes, you can still find it relatable.
B004G6009K|5.0|The kids have always loved this movie. They love it even more in 3D. The regular and Blu-ray versions are also included that they watch while on trips.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I'm actually watching the series for the 2nd time since I bought it from Amazon.  I will continue to maintain and use my Amazon.com account for all future purchases. Love, Love, Love
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Quick read.  There were some interesting tidbits in there.  I was interested in how the studies showed how performance declined the more you paid them for certain mundane tasks.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this would be a great game if it didn't start over my game, and every time I &quot;die &quot; it wont let me play again!
B0098TL4YU|5.0|I really enjoy this record!<br />Lyrics saying that life is hopeful, that it's never too late, that you shoud always try even when it's unknown.<br /><br />And awesome vocal from Jimi makes it a 5 star to me!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Now you all hear me, I've read ALOT of books. But something always gets me about this series. I hereby think that Rick Riordan is the best author on the face of the planet. He has written the most popular children series in the US and yet he still keeps writing. The Percy Jackson and The Olympians series is a group of books you can not just put down. Percy Jackson has everything you want as a main character. The details in this book such as, the death of Luke or Annebeth kissing and liking Percy, are just amazing. I have read all of his books, and yet I never get tired of these books. Percy Jackson is more to entertain in a more serious way. The book is still funny not doubt, but not as funny as some other series by Rick Riordan. The Kane Chronicles is mostly for pure humour. I think those books are the 2nd (after Percy Jackson) best books on the face of the planet. Rick Riordan`s New series, The Hero's Of Olympus, is soo addicting I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE HOUSE OF HATES (I hope to Zues that's spelled right). Btw this review was written by a 11 year old. Plus whoever rated this one star is a butt and needs to get a life other than killing parades. :P
B0086700CM|5.0|It is fun because you try to survive<br />For as long as you can but it is so hard to
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a very good game if u liked temple runner u with probably like this fun active game.its not a lot like temple run it has more power ups so once again I rate this game five stars
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was good from beginning to end.  It got my interest form the start (usually a struggle for me) and I couldn't wait to read the following chapters!
B007STXHTM|5.0|It is useless to use a GoPro H2 underwater with its own case. Everybody is aware by now, that the round lens of the regular case forbid clear focus and colour.<br />This case has a flat glass in front of the GPH2 lens and these problems are quite corrected.<br />It certainly needs a red filter, but you can put it during post processing.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Auston can get a littly wordy, but I will definately read it again. Love it, love it, love it.
B0001I55SS|3.0|I liked this movie better when I was a young kid. Watching it now you can see the old special effects.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is so fun... I was just mad when it wouldn't download before. I love it though. mojang did great
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I read the whole book but I had to look past several inconsistencies and things that just flat out would never happen in the real world. Lee Child was recommended to me by two people that have read all of his stuff and of course there is a Tom Cruise movie out now with this character.<br />Not good enough in my opinion to read the other ones - going back to Vince Flynn.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|My choice was 1 because I don't like it very much thank you and have a announcement to make anytime
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Every bit as good as the Matt Damon ones - great stuff if you like these kind of movies. Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like that it's like SIM city I really enjoy these strategy creation games.  I would definitely recommend to the same kind of people
B005H29GSI|3.0|Chances are that if you have a 4-8 year old in your house, you have something Angry Birds-related. Those birds are so ubiquitous these days that one day we'll have angry birds cars, computers, vacuum cleaners, etc.<br /><br />We've already tried one Angry Birds game and we enjoyed it.  We were lucky enough to be able to try Angry Birds \\"On Thin Ice\\" and it, too, is fine game, but not perfect.  And if yours are any like ours, they'll probably just want to forego the card part and launch birds to break down the structures, which can be challenging on anything other than a flat surface.<br /><br />It's a fun game and good for parent/child and/or family bonding -- and that's what important.
B004498KPU|5.0|Michael Jackson was more than The King of Pop - he was a true artist and visionary.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson plays this game on my Kindle Fire every day after school and is really enjoying it.  It's great that they can be creative in this game.
0385366752|5.0|The set was as advertised, no problems. Enjoyed listen I  on long trips to keep me awake! Would do business again!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book.  I've read a lot of Nicholas Spark's books, which are all good, but the suspense and mystery were really good in this book.  I would love for him to write more mystery and suspense books!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|you can just play this game for a few minutes...until you have to pay for more hearts....or login in to facebook...neither of which I am willing to do
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and was sad when it was over! It is more about loving yourself, being true to yourself and loving life than it is about an illness! It was changed my life!
B00AJLHULW|5.0|If you dig Robben Ford,then this CD is a must have.The overall vibe is somewhat laid back,but Robben's guitar still sings with authority.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The scenery is beautiful, the special effects were great, the actors superb, but the movie fell flat.  It was too long and it appears that they stretched out what should have been one movie into a trilogy. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theatre. It would be good to wait until the other two movies come out on DVD and watch them back to back, otherwise you'll feel like you just watched the first part of a movie and the power (electric) went out (kind of like the Super Bowl). Or buying a meal through the drive-thru and getting home to find that the burger is missing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome but im not sure which running app i like better, subway surfers, or temple run.  anyway, this game is really epic and i really reccomend it to anyone looking to find a new, fun alepp/game ITS EPIC XD
B0058VW36U|5.0|I loved this game! om nom is so cute! I bought this for myself and I love it. Some of the levels are hard but it is still fun. I want a little om nom!
B005QPGHQU|4.0|There are a couple of tunes that are a little too &#34;pop-py&#34; for me,  but over all a great album.
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|This is a great movie.  Very beautiful scenery, and the music is wonderful.  My 6 yr old and 9 yr old really enjoyed it.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It worked pretty well at first, but there are no directions, and only really works when you hold the handle of the knife up in the air. The sharpeners wear down very quickly. The rod is also difficult to use and would take forever to sharpen a serrated blade.
B004J64QR4|5.0|The most wonderful music ever.  I could watch this every day.  If you liked the movie, you will LOVE the 25th anniversary show.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas sparks makes me love his appealing characters and hate his creepy ones. This book has both. The love story drew me in, but the danger was always present.  I had to keep reading until the ending, which was very satisfying.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Not my favorite album of theirs but still worth owning and listening too.  I love Bon Jovi and will continue to do so.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Good graphics, got it when it was free. Got my tablet 2 years ago and saw this game. I kept forgetting to give it a shot because it was through Nvidia app until I saw it on amazon which is free for the day.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele's personality is as amazing as her performance. I enjoyed listening to the stories behind each song. This sounds corny, but after watching this I felt as though I'd actually been there.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|My friend had a book in Word format and I used the reference to get it in publishable form.  The book is very short and provides step by step instructions for formatting a book in the needed E-Book format and getting it into the Kindle Store.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was definately a page turner, I couldn't put it down and have recommended it to many. I only wish the 3rd was out and we didn't have to wait.
B000JMKNVK|3.0|Of all the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, this is the least interesting...or maybe the formula is wearing on me. The differences between these books, and &#34;The Given Day&#34; (Lehane's master work), are striking. The former have that Ian Fleming &#34;one chapter before lunch&#34; feel. The latter features great character development, a hugely interesting and complex multi-tiered plot, beautiful prose...more like Steinbeck than pulp. Go there last, or you'll be disapointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. it has survival and creative mode. thank you mojang<br />for this  app. Your the best!!!!!!!  I'd would give it 4,0000 stars because it's awesome and has multiplayer  you must buy minecraft
B004MC8CA2|5.0|my daughter is very deep into the bible already and this allowed her to take it with her electronically...thank you
1451696191|5.0|One of the best books ever written, hands down. It summarizes the problems that transcend generations because we simply can't bring ourselves to talk about the bad things that happen in life.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|A good movie, I really enjoyed it.  A must for anyone who likes animal movies. A heart wrenching movie to say the least.
B0060AY85C|3.0|this purchase was not really my taste in books and to me it was ok but others might really like this reading material.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|I thought it was a little too violent. Since it was an Award movie I thought it would be worth watching.  A little too violent for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is good. Seems fine to me for five minutes playing it. Wonderful as it is beauty is a stupid name for a horse.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I was really disappointed with this movie.  I think it was the worse Denzel Washington movie I've ever seen.<br />Not good at all in my opinion.
0062082353|5.0|he wrote it like he was having a conversation with me - great read - got pretty emotional at the end
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Was Totally thrilled With The Performance.. Loved It. A definite Must See For The Whole Family.. Great Movie never Expected It To Be So Good.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE .  CANT WAIT TILL SEASON 3 COMES OUT.  GOOD STORY  BUT IT HAS ITS SAD MOMENTS AT TIMES
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have struggled with weight loss all my life. At 61 years old the problem was becoming worse and worse and my weight had skyrocketed even though i maintain a very active life style. I had read about the book in the New York Times and decided to add it to my &#34;collection.&#34;  I have had great success with the diet and in the first two weeks lost almost 11 lbs. Adding to the &#34;fast&#34; I also realized that the worst culprit to limiting my weight lost was how much sodium I was ingesting....way out of of control. For maximum personal satisfaction be sure to watch your sodium intake and try tp keep it under 1200mg a day ( recommended is 1500, but once you start you lose your desire for it. The greatest  advantage with the diet is that my blood pressure has dropped from crazy to normal and i feel great. I, like others who  have used the diet actually look forward to my two fast days. I still continue to run and cycle with no desire for &#34;binge&#34; eating..Great program
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Very fast paced, factual, intriguing, and the best guns on the planet! This movie ROCKS!!! For chicks, it's a very good love story...
B000066AXE|5.0|This is one of my movies I call great. Great acting and a fantastic story. It is so good it gives me chills. Definitely one of the greatest movies.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|When I first found this app I was like &quot;Oh my God I cant wait to play!&quot; Ive been scared to play the real one so I thought why not start here I start to play at first I was like &quot;No way I'm going to get past 5 pages&quot; my first time playing it I found 7/8 pages.I spent 30 min look for the last one I looked every where and I didn't even see slender man that much and when I did he was walking in place did he scare me yes but after some time out of no where I fall throw the game! ya my parson just went right throw tha floor! so I just quit. so from my point of what I know if your going to play slender man play it right and not play this unless you just want to run around doing nothing....Play that REAL slender man or don't it at all!
B000LPS3B2|5.0|When I first saw this movie it was the scariest I've seen. But now that I saw it, it isn't like that anymore. But this is one of my favorite horror  movies. I love it. Very well done.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I didnt know at first if I would like this movie, but i thought it was hilarious, sooo funny. Recommended
B0015XHP4K|5.0|So many Vietnam Veterans were mistreated by their home country after the war. Rambo is one person who fought back, and with the help of his trainer/mentor, he succeeded! Well worth watching in one sitting if possible, allows the story to build to a climactic end!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is awesome!  I love to play it. I just wish they had more people to play on. otherwise,  I love it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I stumbled across Imagine Dragons by way of Spotify, and when I heard It's Time, I recognized it from its frequent appearance on my local radio station. Sounded interesting, and Radioactive was starting to show up all over the place, so I gave the full album a whirl on Spotify, and immediately loved it so much I knew I had to own it. These guys are going to be BIG.
B002VECM72|4.0|So many have given their opinions of the movie and multiple summaries of the plot so I won't bore you with another.  This is a 5 star movie, yes, but I gave it a 4 simply for the transfer to BluRay, which is what this review is about.<br /><br />The video transfer is simply excellent with an average Mbps rate between the mid 20's and lower 30's.  The coloration of the transfer is warm yet very realistic in skin tones, background environment and color resolution.  At no point did I see any artifacting, aliasing or stair-stepping which might have been noticeable in the crowd scenes more than any other place.  There were good details in the shadow and darker areas though most of movie takes place during daylight or well lit indoor scenes.  Because the technology of filmmaking has improved so much in recent years, you will probably not see a night and day difference between the Blu Ray and Standard Def versions( I do have the SD disc but am not using this review as a head to head comparison.  Never the less, you will see improvement in the contrast and smaller details. 5 stars<br /><br />The audio is a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and this dialogue driven film delivers in clear and precise dialogue with nicely balanced levels so that you do not ever need to roller coaster your remote's volume control. Once set to the volume you want you can leave it there.  There is a big and audible difference between the lossy audio of some discs and the lossless of this and others. You really can hear the difference.  That said, most all audio on The Blind Side takes place in the front stage with some, just a few, foley effects for the left or right speakers.  Usually, this occurs when a door closes on either side of the stage.  There is no real use of the rear channels and very, very little for the LFE sub channel to use.  4 stars.<br /><br />There are several extras including deleted scenes, most of which would have fit nicely into an extended version, an interview with the real Michael Ohre, Quinton Aaron who plays him in the movie and also some of his friends and relatives, football coaches and a back and forth discussion between Sandra Bullock and the real Leigh Anne Tuchy.  The extras on this Blu Ray were all created in 2010 and I appreciated them all.<br /><br />If you do not already have The Blind Side in your collection, then, by all means, the Blu Ray is the way to go.  However, if  you already have it in Standard Def, I do not feel that there will be an epiphany of video or audio discovery because you upgraded to Blu Ray.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so hope they are of help as well.<br />I do hope this brief review of the Blu Ray's transfer of The Blind Side has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thankse, Quinton Aaron who plays him in the movie and also some of his friends and relatives, football coaches and a back and forth discussion between Sandra Bullock and the real Leigh Anne Tuchy.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book opened my eyes in many ways. The author did an amazing job giving the American people an inside look on this mission and what it's like to sacrifice everything for the country we live in
B005VPRG10|5.0|Lego. Tie Fighter. Do I really need to say anything else here??? It's a pretty simple design, but still loads of fun to make again and again. There's also quite a bit of repetition in the building of it, but seriously who cares. The whole point is to make it so you can run around your house with it and make Tie Fighter sound effects, right??? And it's very good for that! Fly on my fellow Star Wars nerds!
B009H2PCNC|4.0|Time slows and mind clutter evaporates. I am soothed to the pulses, drones, syncopations and resonance of sound he produces by what ever device he endeavors to manifest them into the airwaves and beyond.<br />I luv most all of his work.<br /><br />Cheers, de lamb
B00270WH3Y|5.0|So glad to have this in mp3 format. This collection is classic and a beautiful collection of some of the harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|It was a cute story. Classic father-daughter miscommunication and misunderstanding. Fun plot. Funny lines and characters. I would definitely watch it with my little nieces and nephews.
B004JK61K0|1.0|wort email app ever. I have it on my kindle fire and freezes contently. As soon as I set is up I uninstalled it.
B000MR148S|5.0|My favorite story EVER is by Roald Dahl ('Pig').  This story was not in this book.  But, it was 1st edition & my pastor loved it.  OK?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this book. Has a lot of adult content and should not be read by a child. Sky goes thru a lot and as a young adult she is one of the strongest women I know.
B009Z5975A|5.0|1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />5<br />6<br />7<br />8<br />9<br />10<br />im lazy but exellent product grat timing and price very good
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I like this movie more than the others. Bilboa is much better character than Frodo. Lots of stuff going on too!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It started off a little slow in the beginning, but it makes up for it with all the action in the end.  This book was amazing, as was the whole trilogy.  I recommand this to everyone I know.  It says it's for younger readers, but I don't see how because it deals with some very grown up topics.  It's action pacted and unpredictable.  Soooo good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun game! Lots of free categories to add so you can keep playing! I really enjoy the different pictures available!
B00BDZV7WQ|1.0|I'm all Wayne fan I always support his music but this is some str8 bs ...sex is da subject on every song and the songs sound throwed together this is by far the worst album he put out to date Cash money need to send refunds rns
0920668372|5.0|This is a great book for children!  Robert Munsch is awesome.  It was cute when I had a friend tell me her son cried and said he was never leaving home like the guy in the book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is awesome I luv it because it reminds me of Bejeweled Which is one of my favorite games Thanks Amazon.com <3 It!!!!!
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|I was hoping for more.<br />This just didn't work for me the way I was hoping.<br /><br />I knew i was taking a chance since I made the purchase just from the picture and the description.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The movie wasn't nearly as exciting and suspenseful as the book.  Katniss' personal struggles are more emotional - you have to remember she is only 17 with the weight of the world and the injustice of the regime sit on her shoulders.  Good marks to Suzanne Collins for not presenting a typical heroine ending.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B006MW3UZW|5.0|really high class drama ..intriguing and occupying. we really enjoy watching it. I would recommend this very highly of this program
B000F8O2PG|5.0|love the show  hate the dam reveiws it's a waste of time why can't you just let me do the stars
B001CC7PKS|4.0|While I've always liked the original movie, I was aware of the harsh critical reviews it had gotten. When I found out that there was a &#34;director's cut&#34; I decided to check it out and wow! This is the movie they should have put out in the first place. The editing makes a huge difference in the storyline, and while it was not made on a blockbuster budget like some of the other Marvel movies, this version holds it's own in the Marvel movie catalog...
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I highly recommend this book! Beautiful, but very sad!  I can't believe what people endured! Can't wait to read more books by Tatiana de Rosnay
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love everything about this book! This is like a great modern day love story with a sordid twist. Very delightful :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|His books never disappoint me! They may not be award winning, but I love to read him! A real love story!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The threads of this fascinating tale set in the time of the French Revolution involve characters of many backgrounds. Each is portrayed so vividly that the reader's attention is captured from the first page and held till the last. The musical is a favourite with audiences around the globe and this epic novel is better by far.  It is a long read but well worth the effort.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is cool when you have enough coins you can get more people$!#rain w<br />When you complete the daily challenge they give you more coins I have 8370<br />\\"
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's nice to have a prequal that doesn't break too far from the original, and this on manages to achieve that.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Really enjoy this game. . It's fun fast pace keeps me playing. If u have small children this game even entertains them
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very excellent product.  Runs fast and plays well.  Addicting game with varied challenges.  Good graphics for a game developed for mobile devices.
B00A8KJN14|3.0|Cute story, but really did not see it as an Oscar candidate.  Pretty much typical of Tim Burton's work, which is impressive, but I'm starting to feel that when I've seen one Tim Burton film....I've pretty much seen them all.  The animation all looks the same and the story lines all seem rather similar.<br />Ok film for one time viewing, but that was it.
0920668372|5.0|Well, this is not the first time I have purchased this book for new parents and their children.  I can't read it without tearing up, because it tenderly, through poetry, tells the great love of having a child and being loved, and how that is passed on through generations.  I think my nephew will appreciate it with his newborn son.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|I knew it was time to replace my old banana plugs the last time I moved my speakers and found bits of rubber back there.  The rubber grips that identified red or black and also protected the stripped speaker wire had disintegrated.  That should give you an idea of how old my Cerwin-Vega speakers are.<br /><br />These banana plugs seemed like a good replacement.  They are, mostly.  If you're new to banana plugs, the plugs have a fat spot that compresses when you insert it, and it expands again when the plug is fully inserted, keeping the plug from falling out.  This is wonderful, but with my older speakers that part of the plug doesn't quite fit.  That means that slightly less than a quarter inch of the plug is inserted into the speaker, but it's enough to get a good grip.  I still get a very good connection and great sound.  Other older speakers and systems may not work at all--[[ASIN:B0097JLRZM pin screw plugs]] might be a better choice.<br /><br />I really like AmazonBasics packaging, and this packaging is no exception.  All the packaging is recyclable and very easy to open and use.  The plastic trays have room for fingers, so you don't have to turn the packaging over and probably dump banana plugs everywhere.  If you find clamshell packaging as annoying as I do, AmazonBasics is the way to go.<br /><br />So, they work, they provide a good connection and sound, you can insert the wire into the bottom or side, you can insert one plug into another to connect multiple speakers (if your amp can handle it), and the packaging is easy to use and recyclable.  The price seems to be very good by comparison.  If I were building a professional studio I'd probably buy high-end plugs, but for my good-quality home system these work well.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I recommend this book whether they are dog lovers or not. Anyone reading this delightful book would want a dog in their life.
0739341243|4.0|Very well researched but not over done to the point that got in the way of the larger points/ideas and reading flow.  Changed the way I see people nd my self - or more accurately - heightened my awarness by pointing out the overlooked obvious.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|it is really fun. I would like to suggest more levels but it's not that necessary.  I haven't put down the game yet.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This musical/movie was a very bold undertaking..... the cinematography, the music, the expectations. The acting was amazing - from the well known performers all the way down to the youngest children. My husband was a little disappointed by the lack of professional vocal performances from the cast.... but I liked that the actors were actors and not polished vocalists. That is as it would have been if the real charachters in the real story had told their story in song. And it is such a profound, compelling tale. I loved the book as a teenager and, 40+ years later, loved this movie just as much.<br /><br />We had a lot of trouble getting the download started and some interruptions for &#34;loading&#34; during the movie. We weren't certain wether it was Amazon-related or Comcast-related, but we've had no similar issues with Netflix.... which points to Amazon.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I have still not been able to actually use it for anything because it keeps crashing on my Motorola Photon.
0783225903|5.0|I don't watch many movies a second time. There are too many I haven't seen to repeatedly watch more than once. This is an exception. I love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the series but the ending was not what I expected.  It left me feeling that something was missing, but it was still a wonderful read.  Captivated me til the very last word.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app and you can't beat the price (free).  I play the game quite often - perhaps too often - and have never had any problems with the software.<br /><br />Potential users should know that ads appear at the start of each game.  However I don't feel they are an annoyance or obtrusive in any way.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Amazing improvement from the first.  Instead of only having the samurai you now have the kunoichi and the ronin as well
B0076DCT2G|4.0|i am a nelson demille fan.i found the panther a fast read,and absorbing.demille gets into his characters and lets us get a feel for their characters.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|With practice, these tools will help anyone go through life with more peace of mind and a more loving spirit.  Learn to stop &#34;owning&#34; other people's problems & issues...be yourself in the most authentic way possible.  Enjoy!
B00BCOGM78|4.0|A little more focused in sound than say Blast Tyrant or Robot Hive but a bit more variety than Strange Cousin from the West.  First couple of listens the lyrical content may not have that Clutch weirdness so much but after a few goes lines like \\"You come home, Speaking, Speaking mean and rude, You come home, Reeking, Reeking mean of crude.\\" As of right now for me it is on par with SCFTW.  I have had the opportunity to listen to this maybe a dozen times or so and I really like it.  Someone mentioned that the guitarist, Tim Sult said this was one of their hardest albums to date and arguably it is. At the end of the day I'm not disappointed in buying the album.
1451624468|5.0|As a former Apologists of almost thirty years one of my [our] favorite arguments against Evolutionists (though evolution has nothing whatsoever to do with Big Bang science) was, &#34;How do you get something from nothing? There has to be an uncaused Cause.&#34;  Well, here's your scientific, non-mythological answer.  Clear, concise and at times quite entertaining, Krauss brings theoretical physics and cosmology to you like no one else can.  Read, study and learn. It's great.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a author that is loved by my mother. It was a great book and an easy read
B003JTHXOK|5.0|when being abused you can always find a way out with people who love you and hopefully you can go to the police when possible
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose this rating because compared to my standards it was the lowest but highest I could give it since there's only 5 stars. I thought this was the best out of the three. I couldn't stop reading it. I wish it was more than just a trilogy because I want  to know more about Christian as a father. I would recommend this book to all my friends who are mature enough to see it as more than a book about sex.
0060594896|5.0|Many of you may know Jack Canfield I buy his book because of top #1 best coaches in the Philippines who became Millionaire twice. First, he lost his millions including his friend and went broke and in debt after reading the book what he learn from his employer is opposite on the book. He is featured in Rated K so I decided after seeing the book I went to amazon and buy. It is my first book that I buy. John Calub is came from a poor family get 2 Bachelors Degree as we know in Idustrial Age of economy we believe our parents say that we need to get a job after being in school. You cannot find financial advice here in this book but if you put this as your self-motivation you will change your unproductive habits to productive habits. That is why I wrote 101 goals before I die it is total of 202 and above more goals 1 including in my pocket if possibly I retire and for the rest of my life. I also do the Rule of 5 which is now sometimes my activitiy I understand goals from small things to large things from light weight to heavy weight. Believe it or not I learn to maintain my prayer, meditation, my intuition as I learn from the book, the Dr. formula of events, my core genius, the yellow alert that is how I discover Law of Attraction after reading the book on February and end after 2 or 3 weeks.<br /><br />P.S. If you are lazy try reading this book when you have nothing to do I survived this for 3-6 months of reading for 600 pages.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Since day first she's been playing this game. She told me is even better than temple run, we recommend this game
B0033H7VI6|5.0|A quality knife, great value for the price.  I like it better than tha BK2, and it is less expensive.  I like the circle design on the handle.  It gives a great grip and the small ridges on the top of the tang near the handle is great for thumb control of this knife.  The blade was sharp right out of the box.  I like the coating on the blade.  Time will tell how durable it will be.  I'll carry a smaller Mora neck knife and a small hand ax in my backpack. The Schrade is a solid partner to my triade of blades and edges for the back woods.
B00ABO609A|3.0|Good film overall but a little slow in parts. The acting was really good and I could empathize with the main character.  It just slows to a crawl in places.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it!!! He now wants it with different strap colors. Great price and fast shipping!
B0095P33IW|4.0|Good mix of action and storytelling. I would watch it again. I would watch this before you watch the Avengers.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I had no idea what a snap e-mail for my tablet would be.  Wow.  Easy, I guess.  Love it, bet you will too.  Have had Yahoo on my laptop for many years and will keep it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought the book for my daughter and read it first and loved it.  I then had to buy and read the rest of the series.  I must admit in the old days these would all be in one book.  The writer throws in brilliant little bits to add to the story and I'm sure if I read the book again I would catch more &#34;bits&#34; that I missed the first time.  Lots of fun to read; not really a book I would see people reading half of and forgetting until later.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I had seen Schindler's List at the movies and was very touched.  Recently it was on television, and I decided that I wanted it for my permanent collection.  The anniversary edition was great.<br />It is the story of the conversion of a man from selfish and self-serving to a true hero to so many Jewish caught in the storm.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|Great Movie with breathtaking views of the landscape and great special affects.  Will cause nightmares for children under 10. The end to this movie was a bit rushed but understand the need to begin the next one.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I rated this movie 4 stars for the eye candy. The story so so . It's a great escape froth of a movie.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is a good one because it's one of few LGBT movies that's not full or cliche's or full of impending doom and gloom. It's sweet, beautiful and heartfelt- not Academy Award material but I hardly think it distracts from the film plus, it's better then half the crap out there anyways.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I got one for my husband and me. It's a really great way to carry my blue tooth. I wish it came in other colors but that is my only complaint.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent book. Can't wait for the next one. George Martin is a bonafide genius and takes you on an amazing journey.
B00785P2QC|2.0|To get anything done you either have to play for five minutes then leave for a month then come back to it, or hand over money in &quot;in app purchases.&quot;
B007REV4T8|5.0|Amazing movie; worth every penny to own. Better in a movie theater as this film demands a 'big screen.' fae
B009FZHYKU|2.0|seasons 1 and 2 are really good.. Season 3 is boring.. they dont know how to make the season longer and keep it interesting..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first started reading this book, but I quickly became obsessed with the whole trilogy. Great book and trilogy, highly recommend it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The best high school movie in a long time... the depth and breadth of this story line is beyond what would be expected from this genre of film... the protagonist struggles with his sense of idealism in the midst what he experiences, yet is able to come to grips with his situation without losing his sense of self... this film has a lot of heart  and is one you don't want to miss.
B00B69UQJY|2.0|I had hopes for this album.<br /><br />13 songs comprise 58 minutes on the regular edition CD.<br />Only 3 of the songs (Heaven, Broken, Soft Touch), have any interesting melodies.<br />The other 10 songs are slow, plodding, depressing, tuneless.<br />Dave Gahan does give a fine vocal performance throughout, but the material is weak.<br /><br />If you are a more casual music fan wondering if this album is worth buying, forget it.<br />If this is the kind of music the band is writing, they should<br />not release any more albums.<br /><br />Buyer Beware.
B0002XL35G|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time... slow to develop, yet utterly human in its unfolding... a true classic before media and digital technology turned us into a society of mindless drones...
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|Like others have said, there aren't enough pieces in the game. The cards are pictures of things instead of words, so if you can't tell what it is its very hard to build and know if the guesser is correct. We were 3 adults attempting to play and the other two were hating it so we switch games. I'll try it again with bigger lego fans. Maybe drag out a bucket of extra legos when we do.
0060254920|5.0|Love this book when i was kid, now we get to share it with our soon to be baby! perfect book for the nursery bookself, what else can you say about it, it is a great book.<br /><br />would buy again
B000000OU4|4.0|We Live Here<br /><br />...don't we?<br /><br />Metheny/Mays is one of the most gifted songwriting teams of all time. Irrespective of their (considerable) riffing, shredding, and incomparable arrangements, ask yourself after three listens:<br />\\"Am I know finding myself humming these tunes?\\" You will be.<br /><br />Enough said? Let's shelve all the pseudo-intellectual jazz pretenses and biases and bathe in it. Once again, these guys deliver a life-affirming musical experience unlike any other songwriting team in quite some time.<br /><br />Just listen to Red Sky once. Metheny's harmonies with the Roland (yes?) are brain melting in their intricacy, complexity, and beauty.<br /><br />Who wants to write lyrics for this guy's tunes and make a billion dollars?  I'm in.<br /><br />We live here
B000OV85AW|5.0|Steve and Dustin at their very best!!  No special effects here, super acting and on location that makes you feel, your right there.  Great Classic, glad to find it and will keep it forever.
0446582778|4.0|Obviously , the book is dated and is about the Rodney King and the race riots in Los Angeles during the early 1990's. The plot could have been a little tighter and I figure out the ending pretty early. But, a B novel by Connelly is better then most writers any given day. Harry , the main character, investigates a lawyer like Johnny  Cohran -O.J. Lawyer  who makes a living suing the LAPD who is murdered. Everybody in the police department is a suspect and this political and high profile case is given to Harry.There are a few good twists and Harry is in deep crap because regardless who is convicted it will be a no win situation . Connelly is a smart writer and he knows the police department being a crime writer for the LA Times.<br /><br />He is my favorite writer so obviously I definitely recommend Angel Flight.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the books in paper form and even better kindle version! GREAT characters and development along with action. Recommend readers above 12yrs old.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this album during my first listen. Upon subsequent listens, there were a handful of songs I thought stood out above the rest rest and they are: Angel, Heaven, Broken, Soft Touch/Raw Nerve, and Soothe My Soul. One song I think they missed with is The Child Inside. I think songs that Martin has been lead vocalist on for the past 2-3 albums have been lacking. The Child Inside is not as bad as Jezebel from SOTU (which I think is an awful song), but I have yet to make any measurable connection with it. The four additional tracks aren't bad, but I can see why they did not make the cut for the album. Again, overall, I really enjoyed this album and think that DM fans will not be disappointed.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Everyone talks about how the formats of the songs are different than other albums. Yes, they are super long. Other than that, this album is not offering anything else. The second halves of all the songs sound like a Timbaland demo. The lyrics are not any deeper or emotion filled than his Nsync days (and I was a huge fan as a teenager). Timbaland production sound all the same. It's like these two are stuck in a past era. JT tries to fit in with an urban feel, but with albums like Frank Ocean's and Miguel's coming out in the last year, filled with great deep lyrics and amazing production, make this album sound superficial and shallow. Trying too hard to seem different leaves it empty. Justin needed to come harder as a veteran in the industry. I was a huge fan before because he offered something different at the time. But, this is not fulfilling the higher expectations of his audience that grew up with him.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I just love this series of movies.  I just find them amusing and with my Kindle it was such an easy purchase.  Thank you.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Any lack of enthusiasm you may feel for the in-depth description of SEAL training in the first half of the book will be completely dispelled by the last half.  After on/off readings of the first half; I was completely captured & mesmerized by the last half, and I could not put it down!
0064471837|4.0|As I flew through the pages of Sabriel I felt that old rush of joy I get from reading a fantasy novel. It reminded me that it had been much too long since I indulged in faraway lands and magical journeys. The prologue effectively captured my interest, sharing the details of Sabriel's parentage, describing life in the Old Kingdom, and setting the mystery around Abhorsen:<br /><br />\\"I am a necromancer but not of the common kind. Where others of the art raise the dead. I lay them back to rest. And those that will not rest, I bind- or try to. I am Abhorsen...\\"<br />-Abhorsen, father of Sabriel<br /><br />Eighteen years later Sabriel became the amazing protagonists of the quest across the Wall and into the Old Kingdom. She appealed to me for her strength of character and skill, as well for the complexity of her flaws. While at Wyverley College, she seemed confident, powerful, and authoritative; proficient in charter magic, necromancy, and math. But throughout the novel, I noticed her bravado crumble while she still struggled, determined to find and aid her father. She was hindered by her headstrong refusal to take his place, yet that was the only way to defeat the vicious antagonist, Kerrigor. Her transformation into the Abhorsen did not grant her fantastical powers, instead she was forced to come of age with little preparation and less power than her predecessors.<br /><br />\\"Fear and realization of ignorance were strong medicines against stupid pride,\\"<br />-Sabriel<br /><br />Throughout Sabriel's quest, Nix builds two discongruent worlds side by side. Ancelstierre mirrors our own world a few decades ago while the Old Kingdom is filled with magic and fear. On both sides of the wall, Sabriel meets allies, foes, and both. When first introduced, Mogget, the  sarcastic free magic creature, offered much needed comic relief. However it soon became clear that his malevolence hid beneath the surface of his reluctant assistance. Sabriel soon received a human companion when she disenchanted Touchstone, the amnesic and reserved Charter Mage. It took much longer to turn his still wooden heart back to flesh, but an irascible Sabriel gradually achieved that.<br /><br />The few aspects that threw me off centered around Charter Magic and the other aspects of world-building. Nix thrusts the reader into the story, much the same way Abhorsen's SOS sends Sabriel to the Old Kingdom. There are a plethora of foreign terms and magics that disoriented me at the beginning. Gradually I caught on but I cannot say I fully understood all the nuances of magic by the end of the book. Likewise, I felt a bit disappointed that Sabriel's parents remained a mystery. Who was her mother? Who was her father before being the Abhorsen? Why did loving him cause her mothers death? And still I most sorely missed an explanation regarding Touchstone's magical burst of power when pursued by the scavengers. There were also sporadic shifts to his point of view, which only sometimes served a visible purpose.<br /><br />Overall I devoured the book voraciously, intrigued about the well crafted series of interlocking events and the amazing characters. Sabriel offers all the components of a great high fantasy tale plus the nuances of human nature that are often overlooked in the genre. I will certainly read the sequels to find answers for my queries, as well as enjoy more of what Garth Nix has to offer.<br /><br />[...]d reserved Charter Mage.

B00BF11STU|4.0|It is a much more interesting movie than Argo - which I also enjoyed. But this was more riveting and complex.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so addicting it's ridiculous. This game has cost me hours. Not a bad thing though. Love this game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fault in Our Stars is a poignant story of young love. Green is a powerful storyteller leaving traces of his characters with you long after you close the cover.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not much to say. It's a calculator and it works. Like the way it changes to scientific or standard depending on your device orientation
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I don't believe in buying a lot of videos.  Really, how often do you watch all those DVDs in your closet?  But The Emperor's New Groove is truly one of the only Disney cartoons worth owning.<br /><br />It is clean, moral, and funny.  It is full of quotes to live by that are worth repeating.  Adults and children alike will enjoy watching this movie again and again.<br /><br />I laugh and learn every time I watch it.  It is definitely a classic!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game I have 3 horses with jems from savings I at first didn't. like it on my phone but I like it a lot on my kindle
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book series on a whim (partially because it was cheap), mostly because I had some travel planned and needed something to read.  After reading the first few pages I left it alone because I was sidetracked by work and another novel.  It sat in my queue for about 2-3 months before I decided to pick it back up... and I don't think I put it down much after that!  A great read!  The story combines great word craft and really interesting characters in a very unusual (and well disguised) situation... and then move the story along with a series of jarring plot twists.  Buy this book, read it and try to tell me you didn't really enjoy it!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Good but long. I was bored in some parts. Thrilled in others. Don't skim this book, it will only confuse you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been a wonderful series, but where is it going? Is there to be a season four ? We must resolve the death of William.
055357342X|5.0|recommend this book to anybody. I do find &#34;A Feast for Crows to be a little over priced for a paperback.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Good book to read if free time it was a very sad but happy story buy it and you'll love it
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|I lost the thread of the story-too many kings jostling for power. Liked the witty \\"imp\\" and the beautiful Kaleesee with the dragons, but it's not as intriguing or new as Season 1. Too much gratuitous sex-it became increasingly clear I was not part of the targeted audience, because I don't need to see women's breasts, or some man ramming it home every 20 seconds. Get tired of sexist crap.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is honestly my favorite movie!! It's so funny and my dad even likes it. It's not everyday me and my dad can watch the same movie but this one made us both fall to the ground laughing( so to speak). I watched this movie so many nights in a row and I'm still not bored of this movie!!  It was so worth buying it!!

B00BF123WG|3.0|I really like Jessica Chastain, but the movie was off in timing, didn't seem to flow. Plus, the actors were not articulating and we actually had to turn on the closed caption to see what they were saying. Good story though.

0452289963|5.0|Although an Oprah book, I couldn't relate to the topic or POV in A New Earth and didn't find it engaging. I initially bought it for my dad but a friend suggested I might enjoy it. I read the first chapter and put it down. I found it lacked integrity (and certainly not for my dad). Maybe I was just not in the right frame of mind. But when reading philosophical books I gage them against my favorites like \\"Ishmael\\" by Quinn Daniel,

0618918248|4.0|Clinton Richard Dawkins (born 1941) is an English ethologist and evolutionary biologist, as well as an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford. He has written some of the most creative and challenging defenses of evolutionary theory [e.g., [[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design]], [[ASIN:0393316823 Climbing Mount Improbable]]] of anyone other than the late Stephen Jay Gould. He said in the Preface to this 2006 book, \\"I am sure... that there are lots of people out there who have been brought up in some religion or other, are unhappy in it, don't believe it... but just don't realize that leaving is an option. If you are one of them, this book is for you. It is intended to raise consciousness... to the fact that ... You can be an atheist who is happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.\\" (Pg. 1)<br /><br />After reviewing Einstein's conceptions of God, he comments, \\"I wish that physicists would refrain from using the word God in their specific metaphorical sense. The metaphorical or pantheistic God of the physicists is light years away from the interventionist, miracle-wreaking, thought-reading, sin-punishing, prayer-answering God of the Bible... Deliberately to confuse the two is, in my opinion, an act of intellectual high treason.\\" (Pg. 19) Later, he adds, \\"the deist God is certainly an improvement over the monster of the Bible. Unfortunately it is scarcely more likely that he exists, or ever did.\\" (Pg. 46)<br /><br />He clarifies, \\"I shall define the God Hypothesis more defensibly: there exists a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us. This book will advocate an alternative view: any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\" (Pg. 31)<br /><br />He states, \\"This conclusion is so surprising, I'll say it again. If the odds of life originating spontaneously on a planet were a billion to one against, nevertheless that stupefyingly improbable event would still happen on a billion planets. The chance of finding any one of those billion life-bearing planets recalls the proverbial needle in a haystack. But ... any beings capable of looking must necessarily be sitting on one of those prodigiously rare needles before they even start the search.\\" (Pg. 138) He adds, \\"however small the minority of evolution-friendly planets may be, our planet necessarily has to be one of them\\" (Pg. 141), and \\"the present universe has to be one of that minority, because we are in it.\\" (Pg. 145)<br /><br />He also suggests, \\"The key difference between the genuinely extravagant God hypothesis and the apparently extravagant multiverse hypothesis is one of statistical improbability. The multiverse, for all that it is extravagant, is simple. God, or any intelligent, decision-taking, calculating agent, would have to be highly improbable in the very same statistical sense as the entities he is supposed to explain. The multiverse may seem extravagant in sheer NUMBER of universes. But if each one of those universes is simple in its fundamental laws, we are still not postulating anything highly improbable. The very opposite has to be said of any kind of intelligence.\\" (Pg. 148-149)<br /><br />He admits, \\"there's no denying that, from a moral point of view, Jesus is a huge improvement over the cruel ogre of the Old Testament. Indeed Jesus, if he existed (or whoever wrote his script if he didn't) was surely one of the great ethical innovators of history. The Sermon on the Mount is way ahead of its time.\\" (Pg. 250)<br /><br />Dawkins' book is written so as to be deliberately provocative, of course, so opinions about it will be wildly divergent.

Religion is not. The mystic has recognized something about the nature of consciousness prior to thought, and this recognition is suceptible to rational discussion.

B0052REUW0|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is filled with interesting facts about our history and how we developed from early tribe communities into cities with complex social structures. And how law and order was a major contributor to a more peaceful world.<br /><br />This book is not only interesting as a historical document, but it also gave deeper insigth into our history and what it is like to be a human being.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in history, philosophy, religion or anyone who wants to have a more optimistic view on life.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|My brother saw the Iphone commercial where numbers were scrawled on the screen and they turned into a formula, and asked<br />whether that really works as seen. I said I didn't think so because the disclaimer always says &#34;screen sequences shortened&#34;,<br />but I looked up MyScript Calculator and found it was a free app for my Kindle Fire, so I tried it and it REALLY WORKS! Very<br />intuative to use, scribbling over a wrong figure &#34;erases&#34; it, and even my sloppy writing doesn't throw it off too often. A very<br />useful app once you get the hang of it (which isn't too difficult and kind of fun).
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great. the seeds are great and the grafics too. if I could rate higher I would. plz buy. its worth it (I LOVE BUTTER) (butter is gold)
B005K17RU0|3.0|I loved the previous version. Now I have to search to find the information I want. My biggest frustration is that I can't figure out how to delete cities. I only added one when we were getting ready for vacation. Can't even find a Help or Contact link to ask.
B0000062Y2|2.0|It was not at all what I was expecting. In fact, I didn't listen to all of it and put it away. If I didn't have a copy of the original, I might have liked it better.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It definitely looks awesome on other people's phones, but I've tried downloading and installing it 3 separate times and hasn't even come close to working. Every time as it begins to open a screen pops up with an error message and it immediately closes.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Things I like:<br /><br />1.) adjustable weight<br />2.) Sensitivity control on the mouse for quick switching<br />3.) scroll wheel is extra smooth<br />4.) comfortable in my hand<br />5.) great look<br /><br />Things I don't like<br /><br />1.) the third button on the side is a little too far away, but I don't have big hands<br />2.) I would like the software to be able to communicate multiple key strokes with a single button, maybe it can do this but I have not figured out how.<br /><br />Overall its a very good product at a very reasonable price.
B007HO392S|5.0|Super fast service, item was just as listed and expected.  10 more words required. 10 more words required.  10 more
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I'm only part way through it but I'm enjoying it.  I won't always buy books, I will get them from the library, but I was out of town and had finished reading Perks.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Interesting characters and the time the show is portrayed in will keep your attention.<br />Time line is a little odd, years skip forward but Daisy never ages.<br /><br />Season 1 was 7 episodes - Season 2 is 9 eps - need more shows per season.<br /><br />I recommend this show -
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very easy to read.  Liked the characters.  I knew it was a middle school book but I read it for my neice; she recommended it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|so fun! I love the quality of the game! super fun get the game now I hope u have fun
B007EC27QM|3.0|It's fine, but it's just a calculator.  Not any different than any other one that I've ever used.  It's okay.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical reacher book, he gets put in a bad situation by chance, meets a girl, saves girl, kills the bad guys, some cops are dirty and he kills them too.  Gets banged up, girl does too, makes them fall in lust, and when everything is over he realizes he's a rambling man and moves on.  Interesting though
B0041IXVIK|5.0|I constantly find myself going back to this movie time to time. I have a very large selection and this was one of the ones that naturally comes to my mind. Being ex-military I dream of having an opportunity such as this. Not saying I would survive all the way through the conflict. Simply just imagine; what if that was me…
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Everything was in perfect condition.  I thoroughly enjoyed the series. Can't wait for season three to come out on DVD.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Don't waste your money. This movie is horrible. I'm sorry I wasted money on this movie. I was very disappointed. Why all the language?? very unnecessary!!!  Bla!!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|The Truman Show is one of Jim Carrey's finest movies he's ever done.  The concept of this very film is phenomenal.  I recommend it for just about everyone who loves movies.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a fun game, especially trying to breed the epic dragons. Unfortunately, the dragon market crashed after the 1.14.3 update T-T
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|fun game until it starts over and you lose everything. then you start a second time and what happens...they start you over again. I think they are messing with my head.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I was actually impressed that the movie turned out as well as it did, being a huge fan of the theatrical production.  I wish that the singing was actually singing and not whispering and such.  I will say that the casting was pretty good as well, with Russell Crowe undoubtedly being the weakest link.  If they could have found someone better for his role, I would have enjoyed it much more.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|She is a real artist with a tragic end to her life. Fortunately her music lives on and the many memories of her performances.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This is one of those movies that doesn't have a compelling story line, but just really has fun songs throughout.  I thought that the music was certainly fun and the casting was definitely solid.  Overall, this is a fun movie to watch while you unwind.  Oh, and try out the college a cappella stations on Pandora afterwards :-)  There are more out there than you think!
B001XVD21Y|5.0|A star studded cast and director. Was most impressed by mark wahlberg and jack. Don't delay watching this movie. Worth every penny.
B000000XB8|5.0|The mix is excellent.  Beside the fact that this is a fantastic collection of songs, the pressing was excellent quality and sound is great.  Highly recommend!!
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Premium Rush was a surprising change. A fascinating heart stopping experience. Different to most other movies. Highly recommended for any movie buff.

B005K17RU0|1.0|The new update for Kindle fire is crowded with useless stuff and obscures what I care about.Most importantly,  I can not find radar and satellite feeds like on the old version. This app is going to the archives!!!
B005LAIHCW|5.0|This movie was completely different to what i thought. I honestly thought it was about a haunted house. Fascinating story line that keeps you hanging on until the very end.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|It's like having a caddie in your bag.  I like the ease of use and pin-seeker mode works really well.
B007X98S82|5.0|This is a technically and artistically flawless rendering of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for the violin.  Very glad that I bought it!
098478280X|4.0|Technically challenging interview guide & practice book.  The first couple chapters have great general advice; the remainder of the book has a sampling of different kinds of CS-ey problems often asked during tough technical interviews.<br /><br />If you can solve each problem in one or two languages of your choice (the book uses Java) you're set.<br /><br />Don't wait too long to start reading and studying this!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Easy to understand for little kids and fun for adults, too and it's free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Highly recommend it to all ages!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a great musical movie! The actors are amazing! I have watched it over and over many times and never get tired of seeing it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not for the modest type, that's for sure!! I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the second one. Thumbs up!!
B006M9NJFG|4.0|For my Full Video Review and Demonstration of the Bear Grylls canteen on YouTube, search \\"bear grylls canteen ultimate\\". It should come up #1.<br /><br />Water is an indispensable priority of survival. Imagine having all the cool survival gear and no way to carry, collect or purify water.<br />A person can survive without food for several days if not weeks, but without water the chances of surviving an emergency - beyond a few days - is slim.<br />So let's take a look at this canteen...<br /><br />The Bear Grylls canteen is inspired by, but improves upon the classic military canteen design and nesting cup.<br />The water bottle is made out of thick, BPA free plastic, that is reinforced by a series of raised and textured ribs on the outside.<br />It has a quality leak-proof lid with a built-in gasket. The lid easily spins independent of the soft plastic strap that keep it with the bottle.<br />The nesting cup is made out of food grade aluminum and has two heat-resistant silicone handles, suitable for boiling water or drinking whatever is your cup of tea!<br />A real win for this canteen is how much water it can hold. It holds 1 liter or about 34 fluid ounces of water, which comparatively is more than any other same category canteen out there. It weighs about 3 pounds when it's full.<br />The canteen sheath is made out of a durable-feeling nylon... the canteen nests in the cup and fits snug into the carrier. Both are then held firmly in place with a stretchy nylon strap that secures with a velcro closure system.<br />There is a pouch on the side of the canteen carrier that holds the Bear Grylls  Priority of Survival Pocket Guide...<br />The pocket guide is made out of a soft pliable plastic so it won't get ruined when it gets wet.<br />Another great feature this canteen carrier is the addition of a wide, durable loop that gives the ability to carry the canteen on just about any sized belt and the loop makes if easy to lash or strap to your pack for easy carry.<br />The water bottle does smell like plastic out of the box. SO, I suggest rinsing it out a few times with warm water and baking soda before using it to drink water.<br /><br />WE RATE THIS CANTEEN AT 4.5 stars for the quality of build of the canteen and sheath, the volume of water it carries, the silicon handle covers on the nesting cup and the integration of a pouch for the pocket survival guide.<br /><br />SO, WHO IS THIS CANTEEN FOR?<br />The Bear Grylls Canteen is well designed for just about any outdoor adventure no matter how rigorous... including, camping, hiking, backpacking, hunting, climbing, canoeing... and any other activity where a regular water bottle won't cut it, and you want to easily carry a high volume of water on you.<br />With it's \\"better than military grade\\" design and a street price of less than $30 we recommend the Bear Grylls Survival Series canteen to you as an essential addition to your emergency, survival, camping or outdoor gear.<br /><br />For MORE Cool Survival and Outdoor gear review Videos...

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this game one day while it was free, swiftly made my way through each of the dozens of free levels, and now I'm contemplating buying the booster packs because I'm hooked.  Playing is meditative.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is comedy gold. I loved watching the show when I was younger with my cousins and we loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I am  addicted to it. I love the new update on Rome with the Easter egg hunt. I already collected all the eggs. I think it is awesome!!!!!!!
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|If you enjoyed the TV shows, it is hard to imagine you wouldn't enjoy this movie too! Give it a try - we suspect you'll like it!!<br /><br />Liked: The cast is back; interesting story line<br /><br />Disliked: Nothing (don't get me wrong, the old-school special effects caused our nouveau trekkie tweens to cackle a couple times - but have to give a pass given what we're now used to in 2013...)
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|Short disc, but love Madeleine; this disc won't disappoint fans.  There are some lovely tunes here.  Not my favorite disc of hers.  some of her earlier discs are better, but this IS good.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This movie seems to be more realistic than the B rate movies that were rushed out in the beginning. totally entertaining and well worth the time to watch. A++
B00004Y3OU|5.0|Funny,poignant,captures an &#34;everyman&#34; story of maturing ,evokes memories of  and for certain  era. A beautiful story.<br />It is  no wonder that this movie  won so many awards when first released in the80's.<br />It has subtitles but even if this were a silent movie the story would be told.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|just a overall generally realistic movie. One I think all people can relate too...I could see it again and again...
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Having paid to watch this great epic I have to say I was disappointed. Not in the fact that the film was bad, but in the fact I could only watch 30 minutes before the dark filming and constant political droning was too much. If you want to watch a possibly historically correct retelling of one small (not in historical terms) part of Lincoln's life then this movie is for you. If you want to leave the movie with a well rounded feel for Lincoln as a whole person, his upbringing and how he became who he was, then give it a miss.
B0036RCVJM|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Railway Man by Eric Lomax. It tells the story of a British train enthusiast who was captured by the Japanese during World War II. It not only gives a very readable, engaging and sometimes heart-wrenching account of what life was like as a POW, but also shares the reality of how difficult it was for these men to assimilate back into normal life after the war. While I found the book a little slow to start with (lots of descriptions of trains and railways in Britain), it was well worth plowing through the first few chapters to get to the real action. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of WWII, the pyschological impact of trauma and torture, and the human capacity for forgiveness. All up, The Railway Man contains a great deal of interesting historical fact, and gives the reader real insight into one man's heart.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|Reading this book was the beginning of my journey on a spiritual path 18 years ago. What a treat to be able to have it on my IPad all these years later with the pictures and all to look at frequently. Anyone searching for a book that describes a beautiful journey of spiritual transformation should buy this book. I already had the regular text but bought the kindle version too. I can't get enough of Ram Dass and especially his first book &#34;Be Here Now&#34;
B009KEN87O|5.0|The things I love in a game are:<br />1. Small or nonexistent learning curve<br />2. Fun to play<br />3. Cool graphics and music... It doesn't have to be fancy, just right.<br />4. No banner or heavy ads<br />... And this game have them all!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|My bookclub read this a while back and I just read it last week. I laughed out loud on nearly every page. I love Tina's SNL skits and 30 Rock is one of my favorites, but this book reminded me of me, growing up. She's hysterical. I am so glad I read it. I could relate and found myself sharing parts of her stories with my husband who also loves her comedy. Thank you Amazon!
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|It was a fabulous combination of lighting, colors, water, imagination, fantastic sets, music, and amazing performances. I could watch it again and again.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I ever play in my tablet!!!!! is a lots of fun I got addicted!!!! 5stars!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was exciting and kept my interest. Looking forward to the next game with G5 entertainment. My teenage daughters liked this game also. Keep up the good work.
B0058VW36U|5.0|is a good game for 6-12 child's years old. I'm 11 and I like it too much!!!!! is not very hard but not easy recommendate!!!!!! is a good deal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this book down. Absolutely beautiful. I can't even imagine to pick out words that would justly describe it. I couldn't do it justice. I cried a dangerous amount and laughed an equal amount. This is the kind of book you find comfort in reading many times and share with your friends. I have rarely loved a book so fiercely after only reading it minutes before... John Green knows how to pull your heart strings.
B0099114WO|4.0|This wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The acting was very good. I think I was hoping for more of a romantic comedy. This isn't one that I'll be watching over and over, as I do my favorites. Once, maybe twice, will be enough for me.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|have you ever purchased a console just for a game? i have. since i don't have much time to play game (i play very few games a year), it is especially important for me to play high quality games.<br /><br />P4 is the first ever persona game i have ever played. the unique story line and battle system is very different from other JRPG i have played in the past. the sound track, even though is not the best (Nobuo Uematsu is unbeatable for his work in FF series), is very much up there.<br /><br />you could beat the game for 60 hours, or 120 hours depend on how much you want to explore. the amount of side quest, character development is unbelievable.

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Started off slow but quickly got more intense.really enjoyed it.Wished it hadn't ended the way it did.really enjoy Nicolas Sparks books
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a tightly structured intriguing tale of Katniss, a 16-year old who is faced time and again with life-changing and at times  gut-wrenching challenges. I normally don't read young adult fiction, but this book held my interest throughout. I am not a fan of &#34;series&#34; tales either, but I may make an exception in this case. Both the interactions between the characters and the dialogue have a high degree of believability and at times the book reads like a thriller. It is wholly understandable why this became a movie--it is visually interesting and we find ourselves rooting for Katniss to succeed whatever the odds. Call it a morality tale, call it an adventure story--it is definitely worth your time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Whole family watches. Watched season 1 straight thru. Started season 2 and same thing. Watched 2 episodes a night. Cant wait to start season 3
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series consistently surprises and delights me with each volume, and this is no exception. The writing remains taut and evocative, and the story revelations are amazing and unexpected.
B00BRR66SA|1.0|I bought the CD and now wish I could return it. From all the hype and Justin calling this \\"his best work ever\\", I think it is safe to say the time has come to join Madonna in a much needed retirement home.<br /><br />Timberland produced the whole thing, so all the tracks sound the same and they are very mellow and daunting. None of the tracks stand out (with the exception of Suit and Tie, but even that song falls short of his previous hits). This is nothing like his other past albums (which were great!).<br /><br />If you suffer from a sleeping disorder, listen to this album! It will have you counting sheep before the first track ends.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Sequel to &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;, &#34;A Clash of Kings&#34; continues the dark tale of Westeros, focusing mainly on the Stark family and a few of their allies and ennemies. If you liked the first book of the series, you'll like this one.
0062082353|5.0|Kyle lived in Midlothian, Texas when his extraordinary life was cut short.  It happens to be my hometown too.  But even if it weren't, I'd find this riveting account of this patriot one of my favorite purchases this year or any year.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|The &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34; saga is a great fantasy medieval-fantasy series, that every lover of fantasy books should read. It is well written and keeps you hooked from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />I'd leave a warning though: this is not a book for the faint of heart. The story is extremely dark, very adult, and quite depressing as the reader watches helplessly the George R. R. Martin torturing his characters without mercy. If you're looking for something to cheer you up, this is not it, but if you can take a dark tale, this may be the best book you'll ever read.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club is a book like no other. I haven't really tried other books by Chuck Palahniuk but this one stopped me dead in my tracks. From the beginning teaching you how to make napalm to the twisted sex of Tyler Durden, this story has a lot to offer. \\"In Tyler Durden we trust\\"
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|A magnificent book... No one beat Coelho in addressing the great issues surrounding humanity..... Have to read the book once more to grasp the wisdom more deeply
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|It's a cure little game with interesting times and principals.  It's all about surviving and thriving at the expense of other life forms!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|One of the very best books I've ever read.  I will be thinking about this book for a very long time.
B008IEWBJ8|3.0|The composition was all I expected and more except for<br />the crackle and constant blips and noise was the quality of a very old vinyl.<br />The second hand vinyl I have brought on Amazon is far better than this.<br />I am absolutely disappointed with the quality of vinyl form a renown label as Deutsche Grammophon.<br />I took it to my turntable shop to have it played, they concluded it sounded like reprocessed vinyl.<br />I should return it but as the first copy sent never arrived I am nervous to do so.<br />Please advise if I have a single bad copy and if so what I should do about it.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Snore fest.  Daniel Craig's lines consisted of a stream of mumbles.  I had such high hopes for him after Casino Royale.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The life of Pi is a page turner- excellent story- loved every moment- will re-read immediately.  Highly recommend for ages 10 and up.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Perhaps if I hadn't had to restart the movie every 3 minutes I could have watched it.  I tried to contact amazon online the next day, but was unable to find a way to report streaming quality so I gave up.  PS.  netflix was working fine, so it seemed to be amazon specific.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love this series! Well written and acted! I really look forward to watching The Good Wife on Sunday nights!! See you there.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This movie takes you completely off guard. Watched it on the edge of my seat!!<br />Has as lot of twists and turns!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love how this movie kept my interest at every moment. It is super heart wrenching to watch the heartbreaks of so many people, yet it was so great to see how each of them was able to find good in all of it. My husband and I just love the music and the many serious life questions it brings with it. Because of such intense scenes and deep concepts, I strongly recommend keeping with it's PG 13 rating and only allowing mature minds to watch it. 5 stars for sure!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a Clint Eastwood fan.  So it follows I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Clint is a baseball scout in this movie who is near the end of his contract.<br /><br />The owner of the team is concerned about Clint's ability to continue scouting because of his age.  He has a critic, in the team's front office, that claims Clint can't do a good job because he doesn't know modern methods of scouting like using computers and statistics to verify a player's potential value to the team. He also has a front office supporter, played by John Goodman, that reminds the owner of the all-star players and MVPs that Clint has found for the team.  The owner isn't sure what is his best option.  Goodman takes responsibility for sending Eastwood to scout baseball's hottest prospect.<br /><br />John visits Clint to fill him in on what's at stake and observes that Clint is having problems with his sight (macular degeneration)and a rather foul attitude in general. John becomes concerned about Clint's trip to scout the nation's hottest baseball prospect.  Back in the office John calls Clint's daughter, who is a lawyer and estranged from Clint.  He tells her that he believes it would be good for her to join Clint on the trip.<br /><br />She says no.  She won't do it.  However certain events cause her to change her mind and she goes.<br /><br />The movie has several subplots.  Clint and the daughter reestablishing their relationship.  The daughter and a young rival baseball scout falling in love.  Clint recognizing that the hot power-hitting prospect has &#34;trouble with the curve&#34;.  The daughter discovering a pitching prospect that no other team was scouting.<br /><br />I rated the movie five stars because it is a feel good movie and Clint's antics are great comedy.<br /><br />The movie's premise that no other team's scouts would not be aware that a certain power hitter couldn't hit a breaking ball except this one crusty old scout is I think not realistic.That fact doesn't keep the movie from fully enjoyable.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best show ever made.  It is a shame that  it was canceled after one season.  A great show.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was every thing I wanted in a book<br />It made me feel like I was there<br />That for me makes a good book
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It ties so much of the series up and really is like a continuation of the show.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I like this app because I can access my desktop from anywhere in the house. However, I have not been able to connect on any other WiFi, but for me,I just like a remote interface to my desktop.
0553062182|4.0|This great little book helped explain so many \\"traits\\" I never really understood about myself and my nature. I found the explanation of \\"attachment types\\" particularly interesting.<br />If you are very sensitive to loud noise and chaotic environments you just may be an HSP to some degree. Dr. Aron has many useful techniques to help cope.<br />I first learned of Dr.Aron's work in a short online exerpt and always thought to investigate one day. Then I read \\" The Introvert's Way\\" by Sophia Dembling, which I really loved..great humor used to make very effective points, and that book had several references to Dr. Aron's books as well.<br />Being in a fairly new relationship I really wanted to read The Highly Sensitive Person in Love, but decided to read this one first to get the basic concept and am very glad I did!  It made it much easier to understand the second book.<br />These books are really helpful if you know you are an HSP and struggle with what that means.<br />Go ahead, wade in. You'll be glad you did!
B00006EXCC|4.0|Aftermath is the first album consisting entirely of Jagger/Richards songs.  Many of the songs are classics in the early Stones blues-rock style filled with all the raunch and misogyny that they do best.  This version isn't as tight in construction as the US version and it lacks the hit Paint it Black and the gem Going Home.  Some of the tracks on this version are forgettable, but it's still worth owning to see the Stone's original intent and to see the progress they make as artists.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This book is great! What a great way to start off the greatest series ever! I love this book so much.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|for how simple it is, this game is surprisingly addictive.  i've burned quite a few hours trying to get my mice to the rockets.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the authors way of showing how a seal lives on a day to day basis and how they were moved as well as all the training they had to do
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone that would like the inside story of Bin Laden's demise.
1423101502|5.0|i choose five stars because this series is great and i'd tell my friend to buy it. i love it
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I chose this rating because of the title I used. I wanted to get into the heart of the book but you have  to be patient with books sometimes. I was captivated by the third or fourth chapter. The characters come to life and I found myself quickly falling for the book. The hero is Logan and the natural villain was Keith but it was about love and happiness and how that can effect you as a person. I recommend this book to anyone!!
B009LGO88E|5.0|Picked this up to make using the camera feel more natural while playing Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.  Just received this today and within 30 minutes I could tell that my hands will cramp less and find the game funner and more natural using my new circle pad pro.  If you play any game that supports the circle pad pro and play frequently then I would suggest you pick one up.  Only real downside is that there is no access to the stylus when attached and no charging cradle(takes AAA).
B004L0NGEC|5.0|couldn't find this at first. Couldn't figure out how ti show pics. Love this.. I'm a grandma AND a photographer
B00003CXDD|5.0|I would give this movie as many stars that are in space if I could.  This movie was way ahead of its time.  Great cast and crew, and is a must buy for anyone who loves watching movies.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is simply amazing and the way this book gets over is simply annoying and I can't wait for house of hades to come up.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Love watching it with my best friend or my dad.  Definitely a must buy for any father and son.  Can watch this movie over and over again and never get bored of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It gives you something to do and is very entertaining and some what addicting. It also changes themes along with the holidays which i think is cool.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the hunger games series is really good I would recommend this book to anyone! I love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I liked the game. wonderfully put together. love the new animals and constant new items. the graphics are awesome and little to none freezes
B005K17RU0|5.0|For me, this app has put the weather reporter out of a job. Weather when you want it and fast.
B0000524E5|5.0|This movie is great!  It's a good time to watch and I suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good chick flick.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My 10 year old son and I both enjoyed reading this classic together. I had forgotten how entertaining SC could be.<br /><br />After Tom Sawyer, obviously we devoured Huck Finn.<br /><br />Thank you Google Books!
B00447L4KA|5.0|This movie was the best and it was shipped promptly.  I recommend this movie to anyone and every one who wants to buy it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have loved Josh Groban since he first came out in 2001.  I have loved every cd along the way and this one is just as great.  His voice is beautiful and each song tells a story.  He is truly amazing.
B00001PE4D|5.0|This movie is too good for words.  It's suspenseful and sexy all at the same time.  I think everyone should invest in this DVD.
B009186JNO|5.0|If you are a Rolling Stones fan, you will love this amazing footage that captures the mania, energy, and raw sound of the early Stones.<br />It's great to see them so young and having fun!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My children loved this movie and I loved the message... Anyone can be what they want to be. They don't have to stick to limitations put on them by society.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|First half good, second half boring, as in the trilogy to much looping off of heads, and a very weak ending
0765325950|5.0|The book was great. unfortunately it arrived with some minor damage. Not sure who's fault it was but the reason you buy a hardcover is for collecting.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I can't say enough about Gary Clark, Jr. and this recording shows his skill in a wonderful set of songs.
0307888908|3.0|Overall, the book is about having an entrepreneurial mindset for a career in today's economy. Particularly thinking like those in Silicon Valley and also building an effective network using tools such as LinkedIn. While a good advice, it unfortunately falls short of delivering on how to implement such an approach especially outside of Technology.  In addition, the lengthy explanation of how relationships work in business and how everybody should be connected through LinkedIn was a bit of a sale pitch.  This book would probably resonate more with young adult readers.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I like to watch childrens movies with messages which buck the status quo ideas, this one questions progress, as do I.
0307352145|5.0|I found this book to be both a great reference and guide on Introversion.  It is very well researched and the author does a great job debunking many of the myths of what it means to be an introvert.  The book is very inspiring for those of us that are introverts, but in a practical and realistic way that makes you feel comfortable being an introvert.  It should also be helpful for extroverts seeking to understand and relate to family members and coworkers who are introverted.  One of the best books so far on this topic.
0767812166|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out and am glad I finally got around to getting my own copy.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent in every respect, plot, cinematography, casting, costumes and background setting, history. Very worthwhile. If you are not familiar with the show, catch it on PBS
B00395ZYVS|5.0|A well written book that grabs your attention on page one and continues to enrich and intrigue the reader until the last page
B000002KXV|5.0|I seem to only review the music I really like and here is another 5 star.  I am glad it is called Nightfly as I often put it on when I am going to bed.  Very smooth, great melodies, and much like well worn slippers it is a perfect fit for those relaxing moments when you just want to relax..
B001TODCII|5.0|To be honest a little far fetched but a good movie none the less. The mans daughter is 'Taken' in Paris and sold into the sex trade and he goes to find her.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Wow! I am so impressed with this new album from David Bowie.  Each time I play it through I grow more and more fond of this work,  it's really good.  For me it's up there with my favourite Bowie albums such as Diamond Dogs, Scary Monsters (and super creeps) and Hunky Dory.  ' The Next Day' is really worth buying,  I highly recommend this as  essential Bowie album but also as an essential music album in general.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I absolutely love this series! One of the best movies on the second world war I've see from an American perspective. Yes, it's long but a great movie!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE PLAYED....ITS FUN ..RELAXING ...CHALLENGING..ALWAYS TAKING U UP TO MORE INTENSE LEVELS..BUT IT GETS TOUGHER GRADUALLY SO U ARE UP TO THE NEW CHALLENGES...MY MOST FAVORITE SINCE I WAS HOOKED ON ANGRY BIRDS......GREAT.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Great movie about the Stasi in East Germany during the cold war period. Makes you wonder if this is what is in store for us here in the US?
B000V698WE|4.0|One can argue whether or not one likes this album, but if you know and understand music and how it is put together...if you are a player yourself...it cannot be argued whether or not this is a great album.  Even if you don't like it you cannot argue if it is musically good or not.  By all musical standards this is a great album.  I think most people who rated it low are saying they don't like it, and they don't understand the difference between not liking and not being well made.  This is understandable due to the fact that Coltrane drifts from the structure of previous works to the more free flowing style in this side.  There are those who don't like that style much so they say it isn't good.  They don't get it.<br />Conversely I read one review that stated, \\"...arguably his best...\\".  I will argue with this statement.  While I love this side, I have to give his \\"best\\" to Giant Steps.  A Love Supreme, while great, didn't impact the world of jazz as did Giant Steps.  Giant Steps changed the way tenor players all over the world approached music.  If you don't agree then just ask Sonny Rollins.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was around when the first Space Invaders arcade game came out. I played these space shooter games on the first  Nintendo system. maybe I'm going intomy second childhood but it is totally cool to play them again now Thisone is way more fun than the one I have on my computer. I love it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I've always loved the GoT series of books and HBO seems to have pulled off adapting it for television. Highly recommended!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Love this book, it's such a fun adventure! I hope there's more like this one to come! You will love it!
B0060Q962Q|5.0|It is a awesome app there are so many things to do and it is a lot better then the free version.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool tosses the reader into the middle of a claustrophobic, stratified society of several thousand people who live underground. The story turns around one woman's participation and then alienation from the system and what she slowly discovers about the circumstances of her people's origins and their purpose. The characters are interesting and well crafted. Physical circumstances are vivid. The plot line is plausible. You are compelled to keep reading. It is a worthy successor to the post apocalyptic classic C of L.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. After playing. many hidden object games I found this a nice little escape.<br /><br /> Its pretty cool watching the tree village grow. I liked it better than most match up games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall a great read. I could not put it down and finished it very quickly because of it! Highly recommend if you like thrillers.
B008D30K7E|5.0|I loved this book, such a great read. I was captivated by all the twists and turns that seemed to occurr so naturally. I really liked the way it didn't just end flat, there was a real sense of completion.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I loved this movie. It was a gr eat story line and the main actor was great. It was overall a very moving story.
B0031Y9DPU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, found it a little confusing in the beginning as to who was who, but once I got into it it was fine. It's not mind blowing, but a nice read. I like reading books where some elements of real life be it in the past or present are part of the storyline.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Loved the book! I pictured Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion as I was reading it (as Beckett and Castle, of course)! Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Not quite what I expected.  It was a good movie.  Love the color.  Story line was good.  Just wasn't my type of movie.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|If you like strategic games than this is for you :) and I like it now that they have multiplayer because the first one was good but this one has different characters so the game is awesome
B0099114WO|4.0|This was funny.  I did enjoy it a lot. Yes we do take each other for granted as the years go on.  I did recommend it to some of my friends.  They enjoyed it also.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Slow slow slow slow. Boring boring boring boring. I thoght it would be more intresting did not keep my attention.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It's not accurate but, neither are the lotr movies. It's incredibly well done for what it is and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I've wanted this functionality since I got my first smartphone. This adapter lets me output my device to my HDTV for movies, games, and showing off home videos and pictures. I couldn't be happier with this little adapter. Its great that it lets me charge my device at the same time too.
0345803507|4.0|THis is the third book in the series and by far, my least favorite.  The author brought in a bit of intrigue that was really odd.  That said, I LOVE these books.  If you're a writing critic, you probably won't enjoy the books simply because the writing isn't that great.  But the author tells a good story.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Wow, I just finished this season and it really is all of your worst nightmares.  It definitely lives up to its title.  It's definitely different than the first one.  The characters are absolutely amazing, and they were all placed perfectly.  I love horror and gore and this was almost too much for me, but it just made me want to watch it more.  Seriously, completely worth buying if you're into horror, or even the first American horror story.  They do an outstanding job.
0345803485|5.0|Yup.  This book is all that.  Once you read this one, you will not be able to wait until the second...mainly because the book leaves you with somewhat of an unfinished story.  You are pretty much compelled to purchase the second one, not that it's a bad thing!<br />Plus, you will be curious about what Christian will have in mind for Anastasia...how many different ways are there to have sex, anyway?  Well, you'll find out!
0307387178|5.0|... impressive book. We received it quickly and do not have any complains. The hero of the book died in vain, and I do not have any regrets - I believe he loved on this earth only himself
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|If you like period movies, books, etc... then you will love Downton Abbey.  I hadn't even heard about this series until it was spoken about at work.  I was intrigued and began to watch.  I was hooked from the first episode!!  Seeing the differences in women and class structure from then and now was quite eye opening.<br /><br />This series is done with such great attention to detail.  The characters are dressed perfectly, right down to hair and shoes.  The language is spot on.  Maggie Smith is hilarious in this series what with her sharp wit and saucy attitude.  I can't get enough of this series and hope it never ends.  Well done, Masterpiece!!!!
0142419400|5.0|Someone I know recommended this book. I didn't have huge hopes for it but I read the back and thought it sounded corny but fun. I tend to like YA books but not so much 'romantic' type books. I love that the author has a corky sense of humor common in the younger generations. You could tell she was young and fun and it made a huge difference to me. The first page had me laughing already! I love the style of writing as well. Her characters were well developed, especially Anna. I think it was easy to imagine yourself in her shoes because of how the author wrote. You could feel her pain, confusion and love. The story isn't overly complicated but I didn't expect it to be. Obviously once you are about 1/10th of the way through it you know what is going to happen. But if you go into this book expecting some huge plot with extremely complicated stories then look elsewhere, maybe outside of the YA realm of books.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't put it down. I read it in just over 2 days and stayed up way past my bedtime. It wrapped me in. One of those books I wish would have never ended. Can't wait to read Lola and the Boy Next Door. Hopefully it is just as good. And I will for sure watch out for any other books this author writes.
0345803493|5.0|I enjoyed this one much more than the first book and I loved the first book!  With this book, the reader learns more about why Christian is the way he is.  Not that you can understand it, but it's laid our there for you to see.<br /><br />Once again, if you prefer literary fiction, you will find this book to be not up to par as the writing isn't the greatest.  But the author is able to tell a good story and you will read this to the end.
0802473156|5.0|I love the book. I read the whole thing in one day. I would recommend every couple read. Read it before you get married or if you have been married for sixty years!  It is helpful, refreshing and full of truth.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|awesome substitute for the so on to be gone reader. really nice looking too. definitely a recommended app. he hate me
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield was a great TV series.  At times some of the plot twists in a single show will be a little too much but that said it makes for great viewing.  In my opinion it is a great series but comes out a notch below superstars like The Wire and The Sopranos.
B0060MYKTY|4.0|I don't know the target audience for this show-- I suppose it's for people who like the Tudors, and may be interested in the upcoming DaVinci's Demons. As someone interested in the Catholic church, and a fan of Mario Puzo who supposedly found his inspiration in this family, I found it intriguing. The series is mostly quiet, with a lot of plotting in hushed voices, then someone gets a throat slashed or gets poisoned. Battles are either thwarted or mostly fought off screen, though individual murders happen all the time. I think there is enough sex, story and eye candy for most people.<br /><br />A lot of people complain how the show deviates from history, just like the vocal Game of Thrones fanbase is locked in an eternal struggle between book fans and TV show fans. If you have doubts, I think Showtime has the full season 2 premiere free to watch on their website. The episode can stand enough on its own that you can understand what is going on and get a feel for whether or not you will like it.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />There are a few stand out parts for me. We finally find out more about Micheletto the assassin when he travels to his home town with Cesare. The scenes with his mother are hilarious, and we find out why he doesn't ever seem to be preoccupied with a girl or brothels.<br /><br />Lucrezia, the Pope's current mistress, and the mother of his children set out to make sure church funds go to the poor where they are supposed to go. It seems that all the women the Pope sleeps with ultimately become agents of his, doing favors for him like this. One is placed in charge of finding cannons when the French army approaches again. Lucrezia is in charge of the Vatican when the Pope has to go on a journey.<br /><br />The tension between Juan and his two siblings, Cesare and Lucrezia, builds to a fever pitch upon his return to Rome after a hiatus in Spain. Juan kind of gets what he deserves, and Cesare more put him out of his misery than murders him. The scene where the Pope/Rodrigo Borgia buries his son Juan intermixed with scenes of Lucrezia's wedding was very well done. I hope the music score for the second season will be released, because it helped make that moment all the more poignant.<br /><br />Cesare has longed to stop being a cardinal and to be a soldier in the Papal army since the beginning, and this season he dons a mask to avenge his dead lover and to steal gold in an effort to get the Pope to release him. I don't know if his costume was supposed to be true to the period or not, or if they intended it, but the scenes where he puts on his mask and runs about in his armor are hysterical. By day, he's a cardinal, by night, he's Batman! With Micheletto as Robin, and a band of outlaws and no-goods as their Merry Men, the Batman tortures, kills and steals to set right what once was wrong! The mask looks so bad that I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />There are really no extras on the blu ray to speak of. The special features that do exist all seem to be on BD live, and you have to have an internet connection for that. I can't tell you how incredibly annoying that is. There are 2 episodes of Californication and 2 episodes of House of Lies that you can access through the BD live, but neither of these shows interest me in the least. They would have been better off including a couple of key episodes of the Tudors if they needed filler-- at least it would be a related genre. I really resent paying for the discs and then having to go online to ask permission to watch the extras. There aren't even any episodes with commentary as far as I can tell.<br /><br />This show could benefit greatly form a slightly larger budget, and perhaps one or two more episodes per season to keep a better pace. If you're preoccupied by the problems in the modern Catholic church, if you're easily offended by most things that come out of an HBO or Showtime series, if you're an historical nitpicker, or if you're expecting the show to wow you onall levels, don't watch it. It is a solid 4 stars, not even coming close to 5, but it is entertaining and for me a worthwhile watch.all levels, don't watch it. It is a solid 4 stars, not even coming close to 5, but it is entertaining and for me a worthwhile watch.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I have a large HD TV and enjoy seeing the whole picture. Can't understood why manufacturers  stopped making this version.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I am too old to deal with daily diet regamins and counting calories, fat, sodium, etc. on every label.  I am also old enough to see those annual lb or 2 increases adding up.  I exercise daily, and really needed something to kick start weight loss.  I heard about this program on ABC news, and ordered the book from Amazon for my Kindle/Ipad.  It is great!<br /><br />This is one of the most readable diet books I have ever read, and the diet is well researched and explained.  Different options are presented, along with recipes if one chooses to go that route.  (I prefer go to restaurants like Panera where you can count your fastin day calories out online and plan you meal ahead of time).  Two days fasting per week is not unreasonable, and it really seems to make the body kick in to another metabolism level.<br /><br />I tested my ability to fast just prior to vacation, and of course put back on the 3 lbs I lost the first week.  But I'm at it again, and it looks like I will repeat that success and continue until I reach my goal.  I now have several other friends (some much younger) who are trying the diet as well.<br /><br />A great book!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is my favorite book series. I just love kinneys books. I wonder if he's going to make a 8 book. If her is, I wonder what color it is going to be.
1932735410|5.0|This is a book that you will always keep close to you in order to keep healthy projects. Beside that it is very well recommended for PMP preparation.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|this game freezes my kindle fire. the controls are hard to use. I had to uninstall this game after the first time I played. don't get this game it simply freezes your device or at least it does for kindle

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|adore the &quot;bejeweled 2&quot; like atmosphere and it progresses into different levels and different shaped puzzels.  Note:  it is timed, and you must use your bombs and lightening bolt to release items you need.  Works very well on my kindle fire hd 8.9.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I thought the whole premise is getting too close to reality but I loved the book.  I would read another book by the same author.
076790592X|3.0|The book plows the same ground as many others have done before, some with much more success. \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" is to books on dying what \\"The Purpose-Driven Life\\" is to books on Christianity: rehashing the basics while aiming at a mass-market, middlebrow audience.<br /><br />At some point the anodyne aphorisms and philo-religio- mishmash yield diminishing returns and we're left with the same basic truths we can glean from ancient texts since Old Testament times: appreciate your time here, love your family, living the good life leads to grace in death, etc. Still, I suppose doing that constitutes a better life than \\"To crush your enemies -- See them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.\\"
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|If you like The Walking Dead don't listen to the negative reviews.  I have four of Bear McReary's Battlestar Galactica soundtracks and love them all, but this isn't Bear Mcreary music, and so what??  It's good.  If you like the songs they usually play at the end of the episodes you will like this CD.  The main title theme is featured in a remix and I like it.  The only song I didn't think I'd be crazy about was the one featuring Lauren Cohan and Emily Kinney--I love their characters and the episode where Beth sang, but thought it would just be filler--it isn't.  It's as good as the rest, and they sing beautifully.  The whole CD is good and the sour apple reviews are just that--sour and not descriptive for such a good soundtrack that gives the feel of the show.  The only problem is that there are only eight songs.  Check out the music sampler to see for yourself but be warned the Main Title theme remix on the sampler sounds nothing like the one on the cd, which sounds more like the show title theme.

B00B3MN65K|5.0|Because of my disappointment with his previous album, I was a bit reluctant to purchase this one. However, after sampling his new songs I bought All That Echoes immediately! Even though most of the tracks are English, they are still beautiful and engaging to listen to whether you're in the car, at home, or at work. Josh Groban is back!!
159514188X|4.0|Hannah Baker seems like a typical high school teenager, except she isn’t. Hannah commits suicide before being able to graduate and enter the real world. She has reasons for committing suicide and she is determined to let 12 people know how they affected her decision to take her own life. Clay Jenson is one of the people on her list. He receives the box of cassette tapes one day after school and is told to listen to all of the tapes carefully, and to follow a map he had received week ago, to find out why Hannah chose to take end her life.<br /><br />Note: There may be a few spoilers in my list, but none of my comments will ruin the book for you.<br /><br />1. It’s a page turner, to the max. I was laughing at myself while I was reading it because I couldn’t put it down. My husband told me that I need to stop reading so fast, and here I am reading this book like it’ll disappear by the end of the night.<br />2. I love that even though the book has a mostly serious tone, it still made me laugh from time to time. Hannah likes to put jokes in her tapes to keep the listeners on their toes. They may not find the jokes funny, but I do.<br />3. I read this book in a time span of 25 hours; stopping to sleep, tutor, clean the house, exercise, and eat.<br />4. Boys and girls can relate to this book. Who wasn’t bullied in middle school/high school? Even the “cool” kids are harassed. No one is comfortable in their own body at that age, no matter how much they tell you they are.<br />5. The map that Hannah provides of the town is a really cool idea. Although the journey towards her death is sad, I felt so attached to her character as I traveled with Clay to each place that was important in her story.<br />6. You can listen to the tapes that Hannah has recorded here, which makes the whole book even creepier. The tapes are not word for word, like in the book, but they are a great addition to the novel, especially if this is a book that a class is reading in school. The tapes can be played the next day after the students have read a chapter the night before.<br />7. It is a suspense novel. Of course, when the novel begins, or even before you open it, you know that Hannah commits suicide, it tells you this on the back cover, but you don’t know why or how. This is what keeps the pages turning; this is what kept me on the edge of my seat while I was reading it.<br />8. As I was reading Hannah’s story, even though I knew she was dead, I kept thinking, “Well, maybe she isn’t. Maybe she will be alive in the end.” I had hope for Hannah, I had to have hope or I would have just cried the whole time.<br />9. Clay is so endearing. I just wanted to tear him from the pages and give him a huge hug. He wanted to help Hannah so bad and he was/is so in love with her. It pains me to think that he is going to have to live with Hannah’s final words in his mind forever.<br />10. I don’t know about you but when I read, I like to know how many pages I have until the next chapter starts, especially when I start to get tired. Since each chapter had a black, thick line on the first page of the chapter, I could clearly identify while looking on the outside of the book when the next chapter started. This was helpful!<br />11. The diner in the book is called “Rosie’s Diner.” My name isn’t used very often in books/movies/anywhere really, but I feel special when it is used.<br />12. I like how this story showed a different side to bullying. Not the typical, “Everyone is mean to me and no one talks to me.” It was more harassment and rumor starting kind of bullying, making Hannah feel uncomfortable and unsafe, wherever she went. People may not consider this bullying, but it is.<br />13. This is a good book for girls and guys. I am impressed that Jay Asher was able to pick up the voice of a female character as well as he did and make her sound so real and emotional.<br /><br />This review, plus additional information, is posted in my blog.apes can be played the next day after the students have read a chapter the night before.<br />7.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|All the humor, heart, and action in this movie keep on making me Miyazaki's number one fan! Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, and Porco Rosso are my top favorites! Anime fans should definitely watch these titles whenever they can.
1878424319|5.0|I liked the book it was a hard cover and was cheap too loved the book and happy with the purchase. I would also recommend everyone to buy this book read it and make peace with ones self .
B000E97Y6A|4.0|The effects, the story line, the characters are all incredible which makes this movie worth buying. However, I am not fan at all of the language. The characters used God's name in vain too many times. Of all the profanity, those kind are the most vulgar and offensive.
0486278077|5.0|I didnt realize it was a soft cover untill it came in but i am happy with what i got looks like new and worth every buck loved the book and the service too.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end! When I rented this I thought it was a supernatural horror movie. Even though it does have it's moments where it gives off that illusion, that's not the purpose of this film. The psychological twists and turns throughout this film had me on the edge of my seat most of the movie! Brilliantly written and acted, Dream House is one the best purchases I've ever made.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had seen the movie before I read the book.  Maybe the best movie I have ever seen.....  This book is equally as good.  I think it was helpful in this case to have seen the movie and be able to picture the characters as I read the book. Highly recommend!
0740745271|5.0|I first saw/read one of these in my dentist's office and, years later, remembered them and went on a hunt to buy all I could.  Mission accomplished...for the most part.  These books are really amazing and help you train your eyes.  I'll look at them, put them away for awhile, then bring them out later and it's like the first time all over again.  Very cool.
0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman begins Coraline as a sort of Alice in Wonderland story about a young girl, Coraline, who loves exploring and finds her way into a topsy turvy universe when she goes through a strange door in her new house.  However, while Lewis Carroll included only a hint of danger in his classic story, Gaiman has no compunction about turning Coraline's innocent exploration into a dark tale, feeding on children's basest fears.<br /><br />Although everything in the world Coraline enters seems familiar at first glance, she quickly begins to notice oddities in the people she sees, whether they are doppleganger's for her eccentric neighbors or the people she comes to think of as \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father.\\"  Perhaps the strangest creature she meets, at least during her first explorations, is a nameless cat who can speak to her, further invoking the comparison to Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />On her first visit, the strange world seems rather innocuous, but upon her return to her own world, and subsequent explorations into the topsy turvy world, reveal that Coraline has altered many of the conditions of her life and it will require fast thinking to save not only herself, but also her parents and those who became trapped in this new world prior to her.<br /><br />Fortunately for Coraline, she is a brave and resourceful girl, not given to panicking and able to solve the puzzles which are laid before her.  In fact, she is much more savvy than the heroine of Lewis's books, even if she is faced with similar problems of talking animals and strange riddles.  At the same time, Coraline seems like a real child, not too precocious to be believed.<br /><br />Gaiman does a good job in portraying his characters and their situations.  He plays on children's fears of abandonment as well as juveniles need for empowerment.  She acts rationally, calling in the police when her parents first disappear, only resorting to her own heroics when it is clear that she is not going to get help from authority figures.<br /><br />Coraline's tale is short, but only because Gaiman doesn't insist on unnecessary padding to lengthen the book.  It is written as a children's book and will serve as a horror tale for those children who wish to read such things.  For adults, it will serve as an almost nostalgic look back on a time in childhood where the secrets of the universe could be hidden behind a forbidden door.from authority figures.<br /><br />Coraline's tale is short, but only because Gaiman doesn't insist on unnecessary padding to lengthen the book.

0812469496|5.0|I bought this for sentimental reasons.  I used to read it to my son when he was a little boy and wanted a hard cover for a keepsake.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This is just about my favorite Christmas movie.  The cast is top notch and It makes you smile.  Lots of fun!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus´s book is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. An amazing read and I feel privileged to have shared his experiences through the book.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Love it and the iTunes app that is based on it!!!! This is a great one for young kids. She loves turning those pages!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has come along way since the first. I enjoyed the first and I really enjoy the second. It works flawlessly on my DROID Incredible 4G LTE. I highly recommend this game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This will probably be replacing my regular alarm clock. Its great! Lots of options and a good display. Doesn't bother me when sleeping.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this game. Definitely a good way to pass time while waiting for whatever. Graphics looks good and and runs flawlessly on my DROID Incredible 4G LTE without lag. I highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|pretty good. the upgrade options are a little confusing but still good. the turns are too quick makes your eyes hurt
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|Love this. I'm hoping to learn or at least get familiar on how to fly RC from this simulation. Definitely a good way to pass time while waiting for whatever. Graphics could look better. It runs flawlessly on my DROID Incredible 4G LTE without lag.
B0051OJG4Q|5.0|In plain word, flawless...I always listen to the ladies! Julie London, she just put me there. every vocal jazz and standard lovers must have this collection.I highly recommend it. cuz, when you listen to the whole collection of these timeless songs, kinda reminds you of all the coolest Cats in Jazz...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Enjoyed playing this app. The game is great exercise for your brain. The background music is peaceful and relaxing. This I s a fantastic way to relax after a long day at work. Unwind, Chill Out, you have fun stimulating your brain and relax all at the same time.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Really good writing.  Refreshingly new plots.  Best Sci-Fi I've seen since Fringe. Has me hooked!!!  Don't know what else to say.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson really enjoyed playing this game. He figured out right away how to play. He's only five and of course I was VERY impressed. I started playing a few days later and it really is fun. Have to watch the desire to play when I should be doing something else so it doesn't become a bad influence. Otherwise we're good.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love anything Jodi writes, her stories grab you right from the beginning. It's hard to put the book down, once you begin to read it. She is my all time favorite author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I purchased this game first because of the bright colors. I thought my mother who has Alzheimer's would be able to use it to try to keep her mind active. My grandson who is five could also play it. Sharpening his problem solving skills. First off, I played it. In the dark it's extremely colorful on the iPad. I began easy and went into the hard. I was sure my family could use this game. And it was really fun. Unfortunately my mother's Alzheimer's was already advanced to the point that she couldn't remember to stay in the middle of the block she wanted to go through and the pipes kept breaking. My grandson on the other hand was playing perfect games right away and was able to play a bit more difficult level. He really enjoys playing. We all really enjoy the game. *Suggestion.....I would like to see something at the end of a perfect game such as fireworks or flashing colors. My grandson is only five. My mother is 87. I think they'd be more encouraged, and I would like it too. I'm more than five and less than 87, HA! (55). I realize its not advertised as an educational game, but it really is.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|So long and drawn out. Had potential in the beginning. I love the actors but there was very little solid character development that was consistent because of the focus on \\"more realistic\\" romantic dramedy. Makes one feel depressed seeing nothing but the main characters constantly argue.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|This is a simple diet to do...and because I only have to think about 2 days a week, instead of seven...it is easier to stick with!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Chose this game to play when waiting on planes, doctor's office or whatever the wait.  Keeps me a bit more relaxed when you have wait on things.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book is well presented in that each chapter deals with a section of the story.  All the chapters were well blended to tell a very interesting story of a man lost and trying to make sense of this worlds challenges.
B005FISBTO|4.0|Dexter is an always will be fantastic!!!  From season one to this years sixth.  However, all I can say is bring back Julia Stiles as Lumen and give Dexter the life and family he deserves.  Also, I hate those individuals who complain about how evil he is and what a murderer he is.  Well of course he's a murderer and a murderer you would want on your side when someone does something wrong to one of your loved ones; unless you would have the balls and intelligence to do it yourself.....No, I didn't think so!! While it is just a drama, I would find it comforting to know someone like him is really out there picking up the slack that our over-run justice system won't or can't do.  He is not evil in anyway, he's the Arc Angel, the dispatcher of evil.
B000Q5SUT2|5.0|We saw this film at a local privately owned cinema some years ago.It has been<br />deleted from Australian suppliers, and we wanted to renew our knowledge of the screenplay.<br />Eddie Murphy amazed us with his talent.Beyonce Knowles, was good.But Catherine Hudso0n<br />was nothing short of brilliant.We are dedicated classical and opera music lovers.<br />But the quality of music in this film blew us away again.
0345529057|5.0|These books are great! If you follow the HBO Series---you have to read these books! This is a great tale chocked full of everything. Tremendous heroism---horrific villians---epic adventure---tons of sword-play---you name---the books have got it! Read these books! What a journey through this world---this kingdom. Makes the series that much more enjoyable. Excellent companion to the show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the train part and the gems I get so many coins and I play it every day. Lol
B003L77FYS|5.0|Enjoyed each episode.  The chemistry is wonderful between the characters.  Great writing.  Nathan Fillion delivers the &#34;handsomely roguish&#34; Castle beautifully.
B00B7H3NMC|5.0|Interesting and fresh view of the old pieces. It's uncanny how he can maintain the theme and flow even in a total remix
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I like Van a lot, and I love great songs like \\"Celtic New Year\\", \\"Why Must I Always Explain?\\", \\"Queen of the Slipstream\\", and \\"carrying A Torch\\".  But you won't find songs like that on \\"Born to Sing\\".  This new work is way too mellow. Too many horns in the arrangements. Melodies are among the most unmemorable Van ever wrote. Just boring melodies over basic blues changes with a light jazz feel.  Not terrible, but Van can write this kind of material in his sleep.  More work went into the arrangements but it all sounds too close to 'musical wallpaper'.  Diehard fans may love this, but it was a real disappointment for me.
B00181JGI2|5.0|This movie launched these guys into a whole new level of acting. Great Movie and suggest it strongly to anyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was totally taken with Downton Abbey Materpiece Classic, my family and friends got involved and made for great conversation. Looking forward to the next production of Downton Abbey.
B000784WMW|5.0|this is the best Jane Eyre out there by far!!!  This one has more on it than my video did...  which is even better...
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I loved this game! It was fun and a great way to pass the time. The only issue I had with the game is being in one place and having to go aaaaaalllllll the way back a place you just left from just to get one item, then back again to use that item. Otherwise no issues
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent.  I am now a believer.  I missed it when it was on the air and became intrigued when I caught &#34;Serenity&#34; on cable.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Must read for anyone interested in financial independence, even this many years later the book is still relevant and lessons can be drawn.
B006G3D0SO|3.0|This is not a sequel to the MGM classic but really more of a sequel to the original book upon which it was based. It draws heavily on characters in subsequent L. Frank Baum Oz books, and while having an excellent cast, seems to suffer from a limited budget and less than spectacular visuals and effects. You get very little sense of the scope of OZ as the action is limited mostly to an Emerald City (no longer emerald) in shambles, a mountain cave, and a palace interior. Also, with a plot that is clearly targeted at little kids, not adults, there is some pretty disturbing stuff in this movie that would border on horror, so be forewarned if your little ones are easily frightened. Fairuza Balk, Piper Laurie, Jean Marsh and Nicol Williamson are all good though.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Excellent story line and acting. I will be very sorry when I run out of episodes to watch. Highly recommended.
6305252521|5.0|This movie is my best movie. The world is real or unreal is big question.The story is very great.I like this one very much
0670024813|4.0|This book discusses very interesting aspects of societal sustainability comparing older vs. modern societies.  Diamond may be editorializing a little too much here and there, but that's OK for me because I tend to agree with his conclusions.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Was well worth getting this movie in 3D.  Totally better experience, excellent sound quality.  A must have for any movie collector.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! It's so fun! This is the best game iv'e ever played! Challenging friends to beating your highest score is so fun! I love the Easter egg hunt! Thank you Kiloo
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has really seen loss and growth.  The character development has been intense and the gore level seems to have crept up a notch or two, great stuff.<br /><br />Awesome show!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great.  but somewhat predictable love story.  Easy to read & liked the characters alot. Again a great story to become a movie!
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Just what I needed, some great good ole straight ahead rock in roll !!!<br />  I hope they make another CD just like this one.<br />  If you like a Bon scott sound with a dash of Bad Co. and a splash of the latest AC DC and a<br />  twist of ZZ Top..Dang they got it!<br />  Then you will turn this bad boy up. Its the 1980,s and explodes through the speakers.<br />  Krokus.. keepem coming...HALLELUJAH!!!!
B00004W221|5.0|Addition to collection of many others like this I own. I am now waiting for another one I ordered. thank you
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Game play is good but requires the purchase of lives with real money. They should just charge more for the game and not charge for lives
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as perfect as the first book. The emotion this serious brings is real and really drags you in. Can't wait to start the next one.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a John Corey fan and eagerly awaited this latest Nelson DeMille book.  It has not disappointed and don't want the book to end.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really liked this book. But it was very well... violent. I would not suggest reading this book unless you are over the age of 12.
0142410705|5.0|As a middle school teacher, I am a voracious consumer of YA lit, both because I enjoy it and because I have a nearly endless FREE supply in my classroom. I have been disappointed recently by the trash that has been posing as YA literature;  it is no wonder our kids can't write in correct English...but I digress. It seems anyone with a word processor can crank out the literary equivalent of porn: sex scenes strung together by fluffy scenarios and hollow characters. This book is different. The characters are rich, smart and funny. So refreshing when so many YA characters are simply vapid. The humor is intelligent and sarcastic. This book is also unique in that it is well-written/edited. There are so many self-published books that read like rough drafts, and I keep wanting to reach for my red teacher pen (except I read on a Kindle).<br /><br />Anyway, the synopsis and other reviews can tell you about the plot and characters, which are unique too. You'll enjoy these snarky characters and the quality writing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just loved this book.  I got it as a present from my brother and it took me a while to start reading.  But I was hooked from the first chapter.  It is hard to put down mainly becuase every time I thought I knew what was going to happen I found out that I really didn't....and was thrilled to to surprised by the author.  Its wonderful.<br />Sarah
0802798225|4.0|My female students AND fellow teachers enjoy this one. This is a a fun romance that reflects the demographics of our nation's teenagers. Addictive and appropriate. While I affectionately recommend it to my colleagues as \\"teen smut,\\" I am also comfortable handing it to my students. It is sexy but not pornographic. The language is authentic, and the story is relatable. The characters are well-developed, likable, and genuine. I always have a waiting list of teens and adults for my three copies!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Like the story lines but some of the eating of people by the walkers can be a little much for me.. All in all it is a great show!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My son loves learning about all the different dragons and breeding them to see what he will get. Very pleasant and enjoyable and you done net to spend money to play.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Very enjoyable. Not the grand vision of Revelation Space, rather a fast paced mystery or puzzle story. Enjoyable well-drawn characters, especially grandmother Eunice. Explores several sci-fi ideas such as the benign but all pervasive &#34;Mech&#34; that regulates unruly humans, and the counterpart &#34;Descrutinized Zone&#34; where people are allowed to revert to happy anarchy. Frequent use of telepresence &#34;chinging&#34;; what a great way to travel. Or the &#34;Evolvarium&#34; where autonomous machines compete with each other in a Darwinian struggle that spins off technological innovations. The vision of the undersea realm of United Aquatic Nations was particularly captivating.<br /><br />As in his other works, there are a few plot twists that don't seem quite plausible. But if you don't get too picky and just go along for the ride, it's a very enjoyable ride
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|Although I liked the movie, I was disappointed by the amazon streaming quality. For PC, it is not HD (720p or 1080p) but SD (480p). Overall, visual on my HDTV looks dull and sometimes stutters. It is lame they provide HD quality to only Kindle and some other devices, not PC. Next time when I watch movies on amazon, I would definitely check if it is HD for PC streaming.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I really liked the movie because it of its substance.  The main character's character and outlook on life is very positive despite having a somewhat hard life.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game!! Plays almost like wow! I've encountered no problems. I highly recommend this game to any wow players. Can't wait for updates!!
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Not bad enough to turn it off, but bad enough I wish that I hadn't started it.  Poorly acted.  Poorly written.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I just got done reading the book. It was a beautiful and a well research book. I found myself having tears going down my cheeks. Michael was a mysterious person, but what he went through all of his life I can understand. You don't want to be looking out of a window and someone on the outside looking in at you all the time. Michael was judged and made fun of from the media, his family and business associates. He gave his all. With a family like his I understand he was the way he was. His family took advantage of him when he was alive and still to so today. Money will not bring him back. He is in a better place.He was an angel on earth and now he is one up in heaven along with many other angels. I would reccommend this book for MJ fans. As far as asking MJ family about certain things in this book, they didn't need to be asked. They were not considerate of him always bothering him to tour and ask for money. Michael was a money machine to his family more than being a son, brother, uncle,etc. Michael was human being.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it was a show about zombies, I expected very little. I could not have been more wrong! This show is about humanity... coming together in a crisis. I love it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Couldn't get interested in the characters or the story line...too many characters to keep up with and nothing about the characters that made me care if I kept up with them or not!  Didn't want to waste my time reading past page 100....
B0084U0IEG|3.0|None of the characters were likeable.  Story wasn't told very well.  Disappointing.  Confusing and I couldn't figure out anyone's motivation for their actions.
B0089OD2N6|4.0|I read this for the first time in years in preparation for reading a take on this book.  It holds up. Enjoyed the intricacies and crisp style. Unfortunately the book, a flip side of this book was disappointing. Nothing like the &#34;Real Thing.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great series.  Good representation of SciFi.  What I like the best and what I think marks a good SciFi writer is the perception of &#34;normal&#34; in the character's accounting.  This series is written in a way that &#34;normal&#34; for the characters is a mystery for the reader, but not in a frustrating way.  Instead it is just intriguing.
0792839749|5.0|Everybody should see this movie!  It's a Classic!  It's ben around so long but never get tired of watching it!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|This is a great kit and feels like a two for one.  Really excellent set that has a lot of cool features.
0316154687|5.0|Read anything by David Sedaris!  He is so tuned into life's little quirks. LOL too funny!  Read anything by David Sedaris!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|This arrived on time and in great condition.  Like season 1, I feel that 10 episodes makes a very short season, but overall I really like the series so I shouldn't complain.
B006YM9JSW|1.0|Intel has did it again, make a expensive, good for nothing piece of junk. Should not say that, could be used for a paper weight.
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|I read the books and had trouble reconciling the tv show with them.  It's not that the shows Re not good but they differ quite a Bit from the books.
B0083F5J7S|5.0|Adam Levine's speaking voice is so different from his singing voice it still amazes me.  There is such a clean sound to those high notes he has, I keep playing this CD over and over In my car.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book stinks I don't think anyone should read it I tried learning how to speak English from this stupid book but it's just harassing my culture and my family and I think this book is just plain mean and should  never be sold again this is such a disgrace to beloved sister who died. Who ever made this book should of watched what they wrote because you are very hurtful to some people.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As usual, great wit. Mr DeMille. Create s a great plot nd character s. However, if takes forever to get to the action.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fillet never disappoints. His historical research and character development keep me reading hour after hour. I cannot wait to read the final book of this trilogy.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The show is so intriguing, and the characters well developed.  Unfortunately, the network keeps moving the show's time, and it's hard to record it all, so the Amazon product is a great fallback option, well worth the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm not much for video games, but I do enjoy this one. It's simple, fun, & I enjoy playing it with my son via wifi.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I got this game for about 4 bucks, then they changed it to 7 bucks. Lucky me :) It is like Grand Theft Auto on the go. I got it on my Kindle Fire, and it works fine. Just beware of the additional data.

B00406O7YK|4.0|Hello Dolly!, as a show, always brings a smile to my face. Barbra Streisand's performance in this is a slightly different take on Dolly Levi's organized chaos, but none-the-less entertaining. The set pieces (locations) and costuming are breathtaking as well.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|The ending to this trilogy was ok. I wished that it was actually mentioned where Hana heard Fred's house explode. I don't like the uncertainty of whether he's actually dead or not. I also wished there was some indication made of how the new government and society would be formed.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Me and my family love this movie. We have seen it so many times. I am glad that I finally was able to get it on Blu-ray to see the vibrant sets in true HD. I love the story, we love to say all of the funny lines. We also like to compare all the funny sayings to old star trek tv shows. Great show it was great.
B002VEEAYA|2.0|The film dragged for the most part.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Its obvious in the book, Dr. Alexander is super motivated to share his NDE.  But if I had to read one more time that his neocortex was shut down, I might throw the book across the room. Oh wait, I read this on my kindle and I don't want to break it!  Also there is very little detail about his actual experience and just a lot of repetition about it mixed with his family's experience while he was in a coma.

B00571F26Y|3.0|I found this book to be somewhat difficult to read as the author strayed off into areas that are probably not very familiar to most of the audience who desire to lose weight. There appeared to be multiple discussions in regards to other diseases and illnesses that maybe a small number of the book audience may have. I wanted this book to give me information on how to make a plan to lose weight. I was slightly disappointed in this book.

B00BGIBVRG|3.0|A couple friends recommended this movie to me.  I'm in my 40s and have dealt with many of the issues in the storyline.  But why does there have to be so much swearing, and why so much of it in front of and by the children??  I was totally turned off and disturbed by that.  My parents never swore in front of me, and if I swore in front of them, I'd be beaten and thrown in my room.  And I'm better for that now!  I guess times have, unfortunately, changed, at least in Hollywood.

LOL!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is an awesome buy. I ordered and received the DVD's in record time. The packaging was in tip top shape and I would recommend it to everyone. Not only did I enjoy watching these over and over I can let friends know it was a great buy as well.

0060555661|5.0|Although this book was written many years ago, the practical information that is provided by Benjamin Graham and the updates by Warren Buffet were &#34;right on&#34; for the non-financial investor such as myself.  I discovered some fantastic tips for investing on my own.  I would recommend this read for anyone thinking about investing or anyone who has money invested - even in a 401K.  Great Book!!!
B005LAII0S|5.0|This was a great movie and can be watched by young adults as well. I chose it because I love Julia Roberts. The package was received in great condition and I will definitely buy from this seller again.
1451695195|3.0|This book was interesting to read but I was disappointing in the subject matter.  I was expecting to have more of a medical explanation of the near death experience - since this occurred to a neuro surgeon.  One good thing I received from the book - other than the standard explanation for the NDE was the referral to the book &#34;Irreducible Mind&#34; - which I since purchased and this is more of the material I was looking for on NDE's.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Ordered this replacement part as the one that came with my Kindle just tore apart (plastic over the wire). Delivered on time, product as expected. Hope it will last more than the 3 years the other one did...
1609611543|3.0|I believe Mr. Davis blames every ill in the world on &#34;wheat&#34;.  This book outlines a plan to completely eliminate wheat from your diet - just doesn't seem practical to me and doubt that it would work - long term - for most people.  It was an interesting read.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I haven't calibrated my kindle to see just how close the average available times to surf, read, TTS etc. are, partially because I'm plugged into the HD7 all day, but it's an attractive program, notifies me in advance of power lows and is more reliable than guessing if the HD is charging through the menu listings. Perfectly happy with this free version.
B008Y78M60|5.0|Great movie about the aftermath of President Lincoln's assassination and the need for revenge to the point of disregarding the law and an individual's right to a fair and impartial trial.  Great cinematography, fine acting and an engaging story.  James McAvoy (one of my favorite actors) is excellent as the counsel for Mary Surratt, accused of participating in the plot to kill President Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State Seward.  Robin Wright is also terrific as Ms. Surratt.  Robert Redford (producer/director) kept me totally attentive and involved in this story which I really knew little about.  Great historical drama though not a very nice comment on some of the unfortunate actions of those in government at the time.  Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn some history through a well acted, directed and photographed movie.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This book is a classic!  It truly should be a book everyone should read.  Steinbeck touched the hearts of all who read this one!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Not the best of the series, but great. Suzanne Collins is such an amazing author. If your a fan of her, you'll love the book
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Most albums have at least a few songs that aren't that great.  Not so Boz Scaggs soul/blues/R&B Memphis album.  If you like bluesy, sexy soul/R&B sung by a master at it with excellent remakes and covers of songs you know but haven't heard sung the way Boz sings them, you'll enjoy every song on this album.  Highly recommended.  Have played the album over and over and never get tired of it.

B0004Z33EQ|4.0|I've seen this movie, Lord knows how many times and I simply never get tired of it. This is one of the best pure action films of all time. It's only flaw (other than some logistical mistakes) is there is very little in the way of character, unlike the original First Blood, and while that is a bummer, this movie is simply a blast. One major difference between the book and the movies that many people don't understand is that in the first one Rambo does not kill because he has honor and was in a non-combat situation. This movie is all about putting him in a combat situation and the result is more like the character from the book: a relentless, merciless killing machine. This very lean action movie has a simple story: Rambo going back to Nam to rescue the boys left behind and blowing the Commies to smithereens on his way out.<br /><br />The way the action was shot and cut has been aped so many times this film doesn't even feel original anymore, but if you can appreciate the origin of action trends look no further than this movie: ground zero for pure 80s action. This movie has a lot going for it, not least of which are editor Mark Goldblatt and cinematographer Jack Cardiff: the latter a legend and the former would become one. The editing is amazingly timed and coherent, making for a great visual narrative.<br /><br />Many people complain the story makes no sense, but they also don't know their history. The story plays as a Rambo version of Bo Gritz's P.O.W. mission, giving Vets a cinematic redemption for the war and P.O.W. issue. Even Regean himself cancelled some P.O.W. missions because he was afraid that the secret wars of Laos and Cambodia would receive too much attention. Check out Bridge On The River Kwai for another rescue war adventure picture that surely was an inspiration (Kevin Jarre, who wrote the treatment for this, grew up with David Lean) for this classic action movie.<br /><br />Between the 2 versions Special and Ultimate (no one cares about the originalbarebones and the Collector's box disc is just a reissue of the Ultimate), if you only buy the single movies, definitely get the SE. The Ultimate includes the same transfer and sound mixes, deletes all the making-of and retrospective interviews and trailers and puts them on a bonus disc (The Ultimate or Collector's for its Rambo 4 inclusion is the best for those wanting them all) and adds some special mode that you can click popups during the movie and read some mildly interesting technical stuff about equipment/weapons in the movie and what amounts to fan fiction about the character's backgrounds (almost none comes from any novel/novelization/script that I have ever read).<br /><br />The commentary by Cosmatos is very informative concerning the logistics of the film, but disappointing concerning character and story (he says next to nothing, infact there are long gaps during his commentary track) confirming suspicion that he was ghost directing for Sly as a traffic cop.

There have been a lot of great YA books lately that we've all been able to enjoy.<br /><br />I usually purchase books on my kindle but based on reviews I bought the hardback. Seems like the way to go for sure.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Simply beautiful music.  I loved every song on there. Don't hesitate to buy this piece of jewel.  I love it!
B000002H92|5.0|Perhaps, aside from the Bright Midnight Archives for bigger fans, if you want a live Doors album, this is it. Forget about the one-disk \\"Absolutely Live\\" or seeking out the rare JP \\"Alive, She Cried\\". This digitally remastered and includes both of the aforementioned, plus a few from \\"Live At The Hollywood Bowl\\". (Might as well get that one on the 30th commemorative DVD anyhow.)<br /><br />I've listened to some of the Doors' live stuff on boxsets over the years and most of it does not have very good sound quality. And while both the boxset material and these disks include some doctoring and splicing of performances, here it is seemless, whereas it is obvious and jarring on the boxset material.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with the Doors' live shows, they opted to use a lot of cover songs and poetry inspired non-LP stuff over many of their hits. As such, this is a very different experience and is as much another complete Doors' album as it is a live one. While that sounds like this could be weaker than all of their albums, this is actually my 4th fav Doors album (after SD, ST and L.A.W). Go Insane and Celebration of the Lizard are both electrifying and haunting. Close To You is quite rocking and Ray shows he can sing the blues along side Jim and not pale, unlike the 2-post Morrison LPs.<br /><br />NOTE: Roadhouse Blues from An American Prayer and Greatest Hits 1980 is also included. This is often sited as the best version of this song. It is a splicing of 3 perfomances! 2 for the song and another for the end speech. Pure engineering gold.
B003IY48PS|5.0|This was a great purchase with no pitfalls. Object arrived exactly as expected and in great time. I love this site.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Poetry is a strange oceanic adventure with zoological features. The Survivor lore is intriguing. The Pacing is comic and masterful. References to God were thought provoking. The final psychological twist was disturbing but fitting. I couldn't put it down.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I caught the Battlestar Galactica miniseries on BBC America this past Jan/Feb and was struck by the cinematography and sheer gravitas of both Edward James Olmos' and Mary McDonnell's approach.  Wow.  Better acting than any Oscar winning leads I've ever seen!  They weren't showing the whole series in order, so I searched online and found this box set on Amazon.<br /><br />I burned through the whole series ( which had two bonus movies included - Razor and The Plan) in 2 weeks flat.  I would highly recommend this box set if you want the total BSG experience.  You won't regret it.

0316224588|5.0|Ian Rankin is one of the best authors of police procedurals writing today. A few years back, he retired his chief protagonist, Detective Inspector John Rebus, Rebus having reached mandatory retirement age. Fans mourned. Rankin kept writing, just not about Rebus.<br /><br />Rebus is back, and \\"Standing in Another Man's Grave\\" is a grand story.<br /><br />Rebus is not the most sympathetic of heroes. He's always disheveled, looking like he slept in his clothes (and he often does). He somehow manages to subsist on a diet of cigarettes, alcohol, and \\"crisps\\" (chips). He's in trouble with his superiors more often than not, and manages to remain politically incorrect in an era of political correctness run amuck. He often consorts with organized crime figures. Even he recognizes what a dinosaur he is.<br /><br />The problem he, Rebus gets results. Rebus solves crimes. And it's hard to argue with success.<br /><br />The mandatory retirement age has changed, and Rebus finds himself back in police service, assigned to a dead-end department for unsolved crimes. He's hoping to return to regular police work; rumor has it that he's applied for a position.<br /><br />A teenaged girl has gone missing. Her family has ties to organized crime elements. Rebus thinks the disappearance may be similar to others from years before. Subsequent events in the investigation probe him right, and he's \\"attached\\"(temporarily assigned) to the main investigation. Non-orthodox police work ensues.<br /><br />Part of the enjoyment of reading an Ian Rankin novel is to watch Rebus resist approved police procedures, maneuver around his superiors, flout the rules, make mistakes, overlook the obvious, and discover what others don't see. A Rebus novel is often less about a crime being investigated and more about how John Rebus in involved in a crime being investigated.<br /><br />The investigation of the missing girl moves forward, aided and abetted by the internet. When bodies are found in a mass grave, the investigation becomes surrounded by a media circus. And in spite of the opposition of everyone he's working with, and being ordered off the team, Rebus begins to close in on a suspect.<br /><br />\\"Standing in Another Man's Grave\\" is tightly written and fast-paced. The often cited Scot names, places and words don't distract (a good map of Scotland will help). In the hands of a lesser writer, all of the Scot references might have been troublesome.<br /><br />We end the book as we begin it - watching John Rebus, recognizing and understanding his all-too-obvious flaws, and cheering him on to prevail over villains, his own police department, gangsters and thugs. We admire his iconoclasm, his natural tendency to resist authority, and his impatience with bureaucracy. John Rebus is us.<br /><br />And we're glad he's back.investigation becomes surrounded by a media circus.

B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I have to admit that when this movie first came out, I was a bit skeptical about it.  Stop-motion animation is generally not my favorite medium when it comes to movies, although I do respect the time and dedication such a process takes.  The fact that this movie came out around the same time as \\"Frankenweenie\\" and \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" probably didn't help -- too many similar-seeming movies at one time, I suppose.  But in the end, I decided to give it a shot, and brought it home from our library.<br /><br />Despite not being a zombie fan, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.  It's hilarious, spooky without being gory, and has a much-needed message beneath the silly antics.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" is the story of Norman, a young boy from the town of Blithe Hollow who can speak to the dead... and is ostracized for his abilities by both his family and his schoolmates.  When his crazy uncle, the only family member he's on speaking terms with, dies and entrusts him with the family duty to keep the spirit of a vengeful witch sealed away (yes, in that order), Norman is at first skeptical.  But when the witch's power brings a group of zombies to life and threatens to destroy the town, Norman has to rely on some unlikely help -- his loser friend Niel, Niel's dumb jock older brother Mitch, his cheerleader sister Courtney, and school bully Alvin -- to end the curse.  He soon discovers that all is not what it seems on this quest, and that fear can be the greatest evil of all.<br /><br />Created by the makers of \\"Coraline,\\" the attention to detail in this film is phenomenal, especially given that much of it is stop-motion instead of CGI.  (My brother even forgot at points that he wasn't watching a CGI film.)  The character designs are not pretty, but they are unique and fit the quirky style of the movie, a nice change from most CGI films where most of the characters look like the same plastic dolls repeated ad nauseum.  The film is quite atmospheric as well, capturing the feel of a New England autumn remarkably well, and the night scenes are especially creepy and well-done.<br /><br />The story, while it falls into some of the usual horror clich&eacute;s (the ostracized kid with a special ability, the dumb but helpful sidekick friend, the brainless jock and cheerleader, the ignorant townsfolk), does manage to turn some of the horror tropes on their heads.  The zombies are perhaps the best example of this... but I won't say any more so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie.  And while it can be effectively creepy at times, it's also side-splittingly funny, and kept surprising our family as it went along.  And as mentioned above, it carries a message about acceptance and fear that's much-needed in this day and age.<br /><br />Word of warning -- this movie is rated PG, and it milks that rating for all it's worth.  There's quite a bit of innuendo and off-color humor, and enough scary moments that I don't advise young children to watch this.  Parents might want to screen this film before giving it to their kids, and judge whether their children are old enough to handle it.<br /><br />All in all a fun, spooky-but-not-terrifying film that would make a good double-bill feature with [[ASIN:B000K3QJRU Monster House]] or the aforementioned [[ASIN:B00AYDC5HY Frankenweenie (2012)]].

There were comments regarding the formatting of this version, but I did not have any problems with it at all.  Great read from start to finish.  Completely creative in the concept, developing characters that you both love and dislike at the same time.  Well worth the price.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love mystery games. This one is great! It's not a demo. It is the full game. It is very mysterious and adventurous.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|it is a different kind of game. I like it okay its just a strange scenario. But it is entertaining
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|\\"Lincoln,\\" directed by Steven Spielberg and starring a mesmerizing Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role, covers the last four months of Lincoln's life, a time when he was trying to persuade the House of Representatives to vote for the 13th amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery.<br /><br />It is no easy task. The Civil War is in its final days and Lincoln, who has assumed considerable wartime powers, is unsure whether his 1863 executive order known as the Emancipation Proclamation will hold up legally once the war is over. The movie primarily deals with the efforts of Lincoln to secure the House votes necessary for passage.<br /><br />These efforts range from promising government jobs in exchange for votes, cajoling reluctant representatives and lecturing others, relying upon his cabinet, particularly Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), to monitor the ever-changing climate in the House, and hiring the aggressive W.N. Bilbo (James Spader) to use his sometimes questionable methods to round up votes.<br /><br />In addition to this protracted political fight, there's turmoil in Lincoln's private life.  He and wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) lost a son two years earlier and the emotional toll still lingers.  Eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is eager to join the Union Army but his parents are dead set against it, fearing he will be yet another casualty of war.  Lincoln understands the young man's patriotic impulse and must deal with his adamant wife about letting Robert enlist.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" is a long picture with a minimum of action. A brief scene of battle early on gives way to the drama of men making deals, speculating on how the country will fare once the war ends, and posturing on the floor of the House.  Through all of this, Lincoln remains calm and focused and determined that the amendment will be passed.  Mr. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is very human -- a simple man in an extraordinary position who understands the delicate balance ofplaying politics, sees issues from multiple perspectives, and favors amusing, earthy anecdotes.  Not impulsive, he  charts a carefully thought-out path to his goal.<br /><br />Mr. Day-Lewis is easily the movie's best attribute.  As the 16th President, he imbues Lincoln with stature, humor, leadership, and determination. The make-up helps to make his transformation into Lincoln believable. If you look at those famous Matthew Brady portraits, you will marvel at the similarity. The real Lincoln was more gaunt and looked far more careworn, but Day-Lewis makes up for the physical shortcoming with a powerful portrayal of a man under pressure from his political opponents, uncertainty about what will happen when the war over, and an outspoken wife protective of her surviving children.<br /><br />Sally Field is the real surprise in \\"Lincoln.\\"  Ms. Field, who gained 20 pounds for the role of Mary, is equal to her screen husband in power. She is physically tiny, particularly in contrast to Day-Lewis' six-foot plus frame, yet she dominates the screen in every scene she's in. Hardly a shrinking violet, she speaks her mind to all, friends and foes alike. At a White House function, for instance, she is quick to tell it like it is to Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), a man with a history of criticizing the President.  Ms. Field's is a well-tempered performance, and she manages to make the big, fancy period gowns and hats look right at home on her tiny frame.<br /><br />Other performances of merit include Jackie Earle Haley's as Vice President of the Confederacy Alexander Stephens, Bruce McGill's as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Hal Holbrook's as political wheeler-dealer Preston Blair, and Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant.<br /><br />Rated PG-13, \\"Lincoln\\" is the kind of picture that attracts critical praise and Oscar nominations but may not prove to be a blockbuster.  Perhaps in deference to its subject matter, the tone is somber, Spielberg's specialty -- action -- is minimal,and the reliance on dialogue often gives the impression of a filmed stage play rather than a truly cinematic effort.<br /><br />Bonus extras on the four-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a digital copy and featurettes on the making of the film, Daniel Day-Lewis' characterization, the film's methodical production design, and the relevance of Lincoln to modern times.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Amazing guitar work and Dewars vocal work is superb,and I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys serious power trio rock.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|It looked good from the commercials so we rented it. Ya there are a few parts that make you jump but the ending sucked.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|The only character who ended up better off at the end of the movie was the personal trainer.  For everyone else it was just a sad documentary.
0439023491|5.0|Loved the books,I had them sent a friend,I hope that she loves them as much as I did.They arrived on time and in good shape.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|If only golf were this fun... but I think the pink sticky material is really expensive in Real Life. The practice option is a nice touch.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is director Peter Jackson's lengthy adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novel.  Taking place 60 years before the events in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, it follows the adventures of young hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who's recruited by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) to help a gang of rowdy dwarves reclaim their mountain home.<br /><br />Jackson's plan to break down \\"The Hobbit\\" into three feature-film installments may tax the patience of his core audience.  The first hour plays very much like a kids' flick. Though the movie does turn darker and more dramatic, the director veers considerably from the well known book in an attempt to add spectacle and endow some characters with loftier motives than Tolkien envisioned.  As in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films, the cinematography and production design are impressive, but the running time makes this fantasy a long slog.<br /><br />A deluxe five-disc edition contains Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD, and Digital Copy.  Bonus extras include Jackson's making-of production videos; featurettes on the start of production, location scouting, and filming in 3D; post-production overview; and footage of the world premiere in Wellington, New Zealand. \\"The Hobbit\\" is also available in a three-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack and a two-disc DVD edition.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun. but I don't like all the ads every time you try to do an activity!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|i really liked this movie. It tells a good story that is family friendly and interesting. I wasn't too fond of the ending though.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I cannot believe what has happen to our agriculture and food supply, I don't think there is any turning back now....  :(
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I really loved this show.I was disappointed in sci-fi for not renewing the contract.But thanks to Amazon I can watch it over and over again.It arrived in good shape and it came faster than I had expected.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great fun little game. The levels/rounds are fairly quick, perfect for killing a few minutes but also easy to stop and pick up later. The only problem I have is the 'just one more' syndrome that ends up being three more.  Very enjoyable.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a movie about the many individuals and agencies dedicated to locating the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.  Director Kathryn Bigelow (\\"The Hurt Locker\\") focuses on one CIA analyst, Maya (Jessica Chastain), who is based on an actual person.<br /><br />The film begins with the interrogation of a terrorist and the use of various forms of torture -- principally water boarding -- by fellow agent Dan (Jason Clarke) as Maya watches emotionless.  The techniques are geared to extract information to help narrow the search for bin Laden.  Bigelow makes no editorial statement here about the morality of such means; she treats them as a standard interrogation techniques.  From this graphic opening, we are introduced to the teams of men and women who work diligently to put together bits of Internet chatter, surveillance tapes, anonymous tips, and phone conversations to postulate where bin Laden is hiding.<br /><br />Maya's sole assignment is the search for bin Laden and she is consumed by the task.  She has no serious relationship, no friends, and not much of a life outside her job.  She believes the key to locating bin Laden is to find and follow his trusted courier.  However, this won't be easy, since the courier is extremely careful in covering his own tracks.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" rises above other political thrillers because it is not burdened with or slowed down by unnecessary romantic entangements, comic relief, or cliche.  In straightforward fashion, Ms. Bigelow takes us through the behind-the-scenes operations of the CIA as it juggles information, spends billions, and is under enormous pressure to get results<br /><br />We see or hear of terrorist attacks that occur after 9/11 in other parts of the world:  recreations of several terrorist bombings and an attack on a CIA compound.  These scenes show the deadly result of the terrorists' perseverence, but there are many equally dramatic scenes setin offices with analysts using their computers and technical data to assemble a picture of a network that might lead to bin Laden.  There is a constant sense of urgency and determination.  These folks don't engage in idle office small talk.  They recognize the importance of their work and coordinate with field agents to close in on their prey.<br /><br />Ms. Chastain plays Maya as an intelligent, sometimes inappropriately outspoken team member with an amazing ability to recognize clues, piece them together, and convince her superiors to bankroll field operations that will net her the next piece of valuable information, building her quest -- one piece at a time -- for the world's foremost terrorist.<br /><br />Maya is heroic in a low-key manner atypical of Hollywood.  She stands by in an office or watches operations on surveillance cameras while soldiers and CIA agents do the dangerous legwork.  If this were a Sylvester Stallone or Jason Statham movie, the stars would singlehandedly find and kill bin Laden.<br /><br />Making the central character a person who thinks through and facilitates a plan rather than shoots her way through it may not sound exciting, but it is.  Ms. Bigelow rivets the viewer from the beginning, taking us through an elaborate procedural in which the outcome is known.  It's how it gets to the outcome that makes this movie special.<br /><br />Mark Boal's script chronicles the Navy SEALS operation that resulted in the death of bin Laden, but this is only one part of the picture.  Its most interesting aspect is depicting how incredibly difficult anti-terrorism is and how many sharp minds are incorporated to fight it.<br /><br />The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack's bonus extras include a making-of featurette, focus on the role of Maya, a tour of the movie's rebuilt compound, and footage of the cast training with authentic SEALS gear.  A single-disc DVD edition containing the same extras is also available.
B000B8657S|5.0|Lovely collection of all the songs, well sung and well-accompanied.  The recording is clear, present, balanced. What could be bad ?

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Language of Flowers: A Novel by Vanessa Diffenbaugh.  I wish I could memorize all of the meanings of flowers.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|What a thrilling read, they keep you in suspence through the whole book. Good romance and magic throughout. Circus magic
B002ZG994U|5.0|Love this movie.  Excellent mix of one-liners and action.  &#34;They specialize in the ridiculous!&#34;  Wish they were going to make a sequel....
B0091QSNEE|5.0|While surfing  through the app store looking for a new game to play  with my grandchildren,  I came across the Dr Panda series. and quickly became enamored with the adorable characters in the game.  My grandchildren, ages 6, 3, and 1.5 all enjoy playing &quot;the cooking game&quot;.  It didn't. take very long for me to buy the full version.
074356619X|5.0|I recommend this to everyone!  This is pretty basic stuff but sometimes simple stuff is the best!  My attitude and life will never be the same.  Bought copies of this CD for all my kids and they have been grateful as their lives have changed as well.  This is a must have!!
0312548079|4.0|This is the second of the series after &#34;Something Borrowed&#34;.  I am more than half way through and it is a really good book.  I like the way the author flips character views from one book to the other so you get to read both sides of the story.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really enjoy this type of ho game. not too difficult nor too easy. I really enjoy the story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am completely and utterly in awe of this piece of work and more so the author!!words cannot express, I simply want to say,if you have not read this book, READ IT NOW! On to book number 2!!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It is not different though in many levels and there was a fee for every step into the game.  It became tedious after a while.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My two children, my husband, and I really enjoy this game.  It is quite addictive.  We enjoy being able to switch out packs, clothes, tools, etc.  We all value different helpers in the game, so this is a nice benefit of it.  My only complaint is that, so far as I have advanced, every time you &#34;die&#34; you have to start all over again.  I have not found where there is a point where once you reach that area and &#34;die&#34; you just start from there.  It leaves me wondering what other scenes are ahead.  I have improved greatly on this game but I suppose I shall never find out what lies beyond.  That is the reason I give 4/5 stars.
1402210795|5.0|Love all of Georgette Heyer's regency books!  What a prolific writer who keeps you coming back for still more of her works!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Can you guys please make this free I really want it!!!!!!PLLLEEEAAASSSEEE!!!!!I really want this app it looks like fun!PLEASE PLEASE!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I very much enjoyed Downton Abbey Season 3.  The plot engages the viewer and the viewer's anticipation is a welcomed<br />bonus.  Can't wait for Season 4.<br />If anything negative can be said, there are so many characters, it is difficult in the beginning (Season 1, Episodes 1 & 2)<br />to keep track of all.
0670026603|5.0|Wow! The entire time that I was reading this book, it was on my mind almost constantly.  It even visited me in my dreams.  I truly flew through the pages in an effort to get to the end.  This is the story of Louisa Clark and Wil Traynor.  They come from opposite sides of the tracks. Lou is just an ordinary girl that has no real goals in life.  She has worked in a small caf&eacute; for the past 7 years and now finds herself unemployed due to the caf&eacute; closing down.  She really needs a job because her parents are having financial problems, and since she still lives with them, she feels that it is necessary for her to help them.  Wil Traynor is a handsome, wealthy businessman that had a life changing accident two years ago that left him a quadriplegic.  His mother runs an ad for a caregiver and ends up hiring Lou.<br />Wil was very much into living the good life prior to the accident. Now he wants to kill himself instead of spending the rest of his life in his wheelchair.  He made a deal with his wealthy parents that he would wait 6 months before acting on the suicide.  His mother hired Lou in hopes of changing Wil's mind.  At first Lou is unaware of this situation, but she quickly figures it out. AT first, Lou did not want anything to do with the situation.  But, she soon gets caught up in it and finds herself constantly making plans in an effort to change Wil's mind.  Along the way, Lou falls in love with Wil.  The entire story keeps you glued to the pages because you want to know if she manages to change his mind or not.<br />Excerpts<br />\\"Want to know the true definition of the triumph of hope over experience?

B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is still a very intense and addicting game and I love it!  You all should get this version!  Happy Birding!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My family and I love all things Phineas and Ferb... and PERRY!  This game is a lot of fun.  My 5 yr old boy, 9 yr old girl, myself (40-ish), and my husband (a year older than me) all enjoy this game.  It is challenging yet not impossible and frustrating.  My children will move on after getting just one yard gnome, whereas I am challenged to keep trying until all are obtained.  I am so amazed to see even my 5 y/o stick with a page until he figures it out.  Great strategy practice!
B009329Y30|5.0|Our family really enjoyed the story line of this movie!  It really tugs at your heart as you see the main character try to find the woman in the photo.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved the books this is a great homage to it. Peter Jackson has a great view of the Tolkien world.
0307352153|5.0|This has provided great insight into members of our own family, as well the population at large and antone involved in human resources would greatly benefit from reading this.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|I will be up front about it,  I am not a big fan of musicals.  This dvd is my wife's.  While I thought the film above average,  my wife would have given it 5 stars.  I thought the acting above average with Russell Crowe's performance a pleasant surprise. I liked the casting of Helena Bonham Carter.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's just plain simple fun. There is an impressive amount of play levels, with just the right amount of strategy needed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so fun to do and it s not hard it is awesome and I love it so much
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to several people.  If you li don't go see the movie, the book is so much better!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|Interesting and quite involving. Childhood years of abuse lured around a present day murder mystery. It pleasantly jumps back and forth from the past to present in smooth transition. The more I read, the more I enjoyed this story. The Isle of Lewis seems like a dark and gloomy place with terrible secrets, but still with a sense of purpose and pose. A worthwhile read.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I bought the game and when I tried to play the game the app refuses to let me play. It keeps saying the content is not owned!!! what the hell is that? I want my money back:(
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had something I rarely find anymore. Honest to god, &#34;Are you kidding me, this is incredible!&#34; Moments.<br />Great book
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great time killer that is free.  Customizations are good and the game moves fast.  I would highly recommend this app to anyone.
B00846REIS|1.0|I read 50 Shades trilogy and loved them.  I could barely finish this book and definitely will not order the 2nd. I found myself skipping dialogue and even sex scenes.  The relationship between Gideon & Eva moved fast and I guess maybe she should have played a little \\" hard to get\\" instead of hard up?? I couldn't get past she swallowed that ??!.  And liked it -Yuck. I really didn't need a mental picture of that.
B000LMPGD8|3.0|When I recieved this it wasn't what I had expected because the movie recieved is for the wrong region (foreign format). I realized that this was my partly my error because the picture shows the region. The disk I received was in perfect condition however.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The authors attention to details was beautiful. I'm planning on reading her other books because I liked this one so much.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I love this series and enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it. Very good story, entertaining. Great read! A plus!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this because it was recommended to touch up the Woodman's Machete. I find myself reaching for it to sharpen all the knives on my bench and tool boxes.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable makes it very easy to transfer music, pictures and other favorates onto your tablet.  I was suprised how easy it was, just cut and paste.
B00466HN72|4.0|good Easter movie for kids and adults.  Very cute.  looks great in blu-ray.  nice feel good movie, etc. etc. etc.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I got more than I expected with this.  You can play and record your own songs and learn how to play other songs. So much fun. I like it lots.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you, MiniSquadron is one of the greatest hidden jewels for your android device. Providing hours of gameplay and plenty of replay value $3 may not seem so bad of a price.<br />*Pros:<br />- 56 different planes to chooses from, several different weapon styles and 8 different (but not entirely unique) maps. Planes are challenging but fun to unlock and the weapon styles dun to master.<br />- Controls are nearly flawless. Simple, tight and easy to use controls make gameplay fun and easy.<br />- Graphics are fun and cute, parents need not worry about their kid playing this game.<br />- Gameplay is great, dogfighting against spaceships, flying turtles fighter jets and other miscellanies is a blast, and while it may get quite difficult, it's hard to feel the urge to give up.<br /><br />*Cons<br />- Crashes. This is essentially why this app received four stars instead of five. They typically haven't happened to me in gameplay but quite often after completing a survival level. It's definetely something to be aware of with this game.<br />  In short, the game is great for any type of gamer, from the 9 year old playing Mario Kart to the 23 year old playing Dead Space. Just be aware of the crashing problem.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This is an excellent movie for young children.  The grandkids loved it and so did I.  We each had our favorite character we cheering for.  I would recommend it for children 5 and up.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|Works well in my BMW armrest, although the charger is a bit of a tight fit in the socket.  Charges my iPhone 5 surprisingly quickly.  LED light is about the right brightness IMHO.  I liked how small the socket plug was once it was plugged it- I am able to close the center armrest and charge the phone while the iPhone is plugged and playing into the AUX input.  It is a bit pricier than some other options, but is probably worth it.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The prodeuct is  quite good.. IT charges iphone fully 3-4 times.. 2  USB is very helpful for charging 2 phones.<br />And it has also adjustable heads - to charge not only iphone but other phones too
B00004S35Z|5.0|stevie wonder has so much talent. the jackson 5 appear on this album in you haven't done nothin'. very cool
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I've loved this movie forever.  I really like buying blu-rays now that the regular edition is included.  It comes in very handy while traveling with a little one.
B009JNXK88|4.0|The game's retro graphics, simple controls and diverse and challenging levels make this game one of favorites for my kindle. League of Evil is really fun and uses Amazon Game Circle (if you want it) to compare your scores to other players. There have been control issues due to lagging, though this may not happen to all users. The 99&cent; you pay for the app is definetely worth your time however, as there will be tons of replay value, no ads or in-game purchases and a challenge on each level.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you are a lover of J. R. R. Tolkien and his other works in the Lord of the Rings<br />series then this DVD is a &#34;must have&#34; to complete the set. The movie plays as<br />true to the book as possible and is done in the same tone and manner of the<br />three previous movies. A great addition to you DVD collection. Enjoy!<br /><br />Still waiting for the Silmarillion.
B0090P98Z4|2.0|good but could be better like bigger maps, able to choose a type of character,  and not freeze after playing for 20 min!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|one of those apps that makes you wonder if this company has a creative development team.  This is solo lame it should be put down. Its not original,  the graphics are bad at best,  and its a waste of memory on your device. IF you are into that sort of bad bad combination then hey its for u. And shame on the Glu Mobile people for posting your own reviews. Pathetic
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it over three times! It's just as good as the original but better because it has Jonny Depp....
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game Is really cool and I love it!! I have a fascination for dinosaurs and dragons and this game makes it to where I can pretend to be with the real thing!!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Thi Blue Ray was shipped and delivered within the 48 hours as promised. It was brand new, still in the plastic. The only issue was the outer cardboard case for the Blue Ray was slightly crushed on the corner, but that could have been the mail carrier or my apartment complexe's fault. The Blue Ray itself was perfect and made a great gift for my Godfather loving boyfriend.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|One of my favorite new bands!! Mike Portnoy is a beast on the drums, Mike Orlando is an astoundlingly great guitarist, Jone Moyer is a master of the throbbing bass, & Russell Allen sounds like the ghost of RJD!! I love this album of cover tunes, they are diverse enough to show the talent of all, & they rip through them with gusto that shows these songs are a piece of their musical heart & soul!! SO SURRENDER TO THE MOB!!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|A movie that is a hit with the 11 and 12 year old set. It's nothing more than a Glee ripoff.  'nuf said
B00785P2QC|5.0|I'm amazed at how well this works and also how much this game feels like cityville from zynga.  Thus is aksi a very good game to spend money on.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is a story that transends the ages.  It has all the facets of human life in one very long tale.  While I initally thought some parts of the novel tended to be overly described, I eventually found them worth it.  Victor Hugo's work is perfect.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a wonderful series..a look back into the past.  Remember to purchase the UK version, great entertainment<br />Enjoy
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Sometimes in life you have to be persistent even when everything and everyone else tells you the opposite. I like that the main character just keep doing her best.
B007M45PMU|5.0|definitely a good buy and has been inspiring to listen to. Inspiring and all together feel good music. Just awesome!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its awesome j love it and it can be fun u need to try ot ok so come on and try it
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I selected this book partly due to the glowing reviews. I rarely bail on a book, but I'm halfway through and I give up.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really liked this app until your most recent upgrade, now I hate it! Why add so much junk to it? It was nice the way it used to be! Simple. Deleted this app and downloaded a different one.  One without all that crap on it! Should have left well enough alone!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved this game!! Only one problem.... it ended. I recommend this game to anyone. It's the kind of game that you can't put down it leaves you wanting more! Can't wait for these next one!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|great brain teaser. uhm... i need more words. okay. well, it's a great brain teaser that i really enjoyed! what!!
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Definitely a good buy and has been inspiring to listen to. Inspiring and all together feel good music. Just awesome!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Wonderful story! Thank you for not letting Omar threaten or hurt Theo. And thanks for not using any bad language.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A must read for any Lincoln devotee or student! elegantly written. A leader of men which unfortunately we lack so much in our time.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is quite an entertaining movie that you can watch over and over again. Get it, you will love it!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Mildly amusing comedy about two really annoying people, a lot of superfluous characters with no depth, and crude language used solely for shock value as opposed to reflecting how people actually talk (&#34;hey let me share with you intimate details using over the top language in a park!&#34;)
B008476HBM|5.0|Such a classic book. So happy I can read it on my tablet! Thanks Amazon for providing this book for free!
B00C0OOV5O|1.0|Went from terrifying to boring. From inspired writing to predictable dribble, from cerebral plot to formula TV. The directing keeps getting worse. The writing makes one cringe like Hershel's crack \\"at least kiss me first\\" when Milton asked to see his leg was so breathtakingly out of character the actors seemed uncomfortable. \\"This Sorrowful Life\\"  episode is the worse ever. From Michone's and Meryls ridiculous car conversation, to Rick's little righteous speech, Glenn's  marriage proposal..seriously..who is writing this? the team from some soap opera?<br /><br />Soo Sad!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its awesome I live it its so fun you race jump over hurrdles and compete against other horses I love it
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Have to see it! Dissapointed to see again only ten episodes but the book and the series are the best!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This is my first Scalzi book. It's worth saying that it appears, on the surface, to be a humorous satire, but doesn't quite deliver one that. It is also worth noting that its not an action oriented book, either.<br />In fact, this whole thing was a bit mystifying. Yet...give it a read. It has a lot of elements from different genres, with the last couple of &#34;codas&#34; (whatever those are) being rather thought provoking.<br />Tl;dr? Read the title.
B0028O9VBA|5.0|Love this movie for the children, one of their favorites.  Shipped fast and price was right.  This was a good purchase.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Their best work yet. I listen to this all the time. Love all the songs. Great alternative rock. They have an original sound.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game<br />is awesome<br />recommends<br />I play this game for hours<br />this is the best game in android<br />I want to see more games like this
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Very well done.  Lots of action and good story line.  I wanted to see more, looking forward to the next season!
B006ATJXQW|2.0|It was ok. Not what I thought it would be. I thought it would explain more about the whole situation.
B002361MLA|5.0|Great help in self growth and written so I understand easily. I have followed Tolle for years and connect with what he says.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the three book series in 2 weeks! It pulled me in and I couldn't put it down.  It had a great story line.  I don't really understand the reviews that it is degrading to women, I didn't see that at all.  I'm sorry I waited so long to purchase the series.
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|Honestly, there's no consistency with the reasons why people hate on wayne & praise other rappers. He is not the first rapper to have degrading, misogynistic lyrics. All the mainstream examples of artists that people fall back on to determine \\"good\\" rap, pac (i get around), biggy (big booty h**s), jay z (big pimpin), nas (oochy wally wally), etc, ALL are guilty of degrading women in their lyrics. It's not a new theme pioneered by wayne. Wayne is an amalgam of things if one really observes his expansive library (not talking about simply studio cd's here. I'm a REAL fan of hiphop/rap and I love digging beneath the surface of major label music. I'm that guy who finds artists way before they ever get on the radio. I consciously go out of my way to look for new people. Predicting Young Scooter & iggy azalea will be the next popular things y'all hear about). He can be conscious, personal/introspective, critical, & funny (something you forgot, dr carter, georgia bush, tie my hands, i feel like dying, misunderstood, and pray to the lord are some examples). Yea he can be immature with his lyrics, but honestly, how many ordinary men are guilty of bragging about their sexual conquests? Again, it's not some sudden thing pioneered by wayne, but a thing that men have done for hundreds of years. Where wayne excels on this cd is in his ability to put a new, fresh twist on familiar subject matter. Lyrically, wayne is very innovative here & sets another example of just how inventive he can be as a rapper. My biggest complaint is with Soulja Boy as a feature. He just seemed out of place here. Not a diss per say, but lyrically he didn't compliment the song well. For the record, the MP3 edition is missing a track called Romance so to get the complete album, buy the physical cd. Randomly & abruptly throwing this out there, but as story tellers go, slick rick & outkast (in my opinion) did it better than any other popular artists that people have mentioned (even too short's b***job betty is impressively put together). To wrap this up, I recommend checking out the new cd by one republic. It's magic.

B00BW5K5DO|2.0|it is NOT FREE. You get to a certain level-and then you have to buy the full game to continue. Ducks.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a great story, which introduced me to a new perspective on the Great War. Well written, and truly enjoyable.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|I bought the player because I bought the TV but had no discs to try. This was my first and therefore worth the over priced value of ownership. A few months later it was on Directv in 3D. I own a total of two  3D Blu-Ray discs and now record 3D on Directv rather than buy discs. How many times can you watch the same zombie movie?
B009R89AA2|5.0|purchased for my son....he loves it. Would definitely recommend.  He is eight years old and was delighted to find this available on kindle....

B007IQX9ZW|2.0|not really worth watching. this is supposed to be a comedy, but it just a series of awkward moments th
B002ECQB46|4.0|Have always enjoyed Beyonce and she was wonderful in this movie along with the other actors and actresses. I had a lot of great laughs. Great movie to watch!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that really incorporates adult themes and fun for children quite nicely. We really enjoyed it!
B004K4IZ54|2.0|I have never understood why anyone needs or wants more than one copy of any movie but then I have never found much need to watch a movie more than once every 10 to 20 years. For those with poor memories and short attention spans they can watch one version on their home entertainment center with Blu-Ray 3D and then watch it again on their older non 3D player if they forgot the ending.  Then maybe they could watch on a regular DVD player in the car or computer when they are bored to tears or trying to numb the brains of their kids. But what the Hecht do you do with a Digital copy? Just another way to sell us what we don't want or need in order to get 3D.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|After reading just a few pages of this book, it was obvious that the auther was a professional wordsmith. Marcus Luttrell's amazing story is brought to life by a talented writer. Buckle up for a rough ride with reality if you choose to read this book.
B00AG6Z92C|1.0|I hate it but my wife loves it I am lucky she plays it when I am not in the car.
B008D37J6O|3.0|Well it was working just great and THEN I installed the newest update on my tablet from Ice Cream Sandwich to Jellybean and it would no longer play audio on my YouTube video downloads. It (the download ) pretty much screwed up my whole tablet ( Toshiba at300 ) I couldn't get most of the stuff I liked or had set up previously working.  Currently it is not installed on my tablet as it wouldn't do anything.
B002R1S9L2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I was afraid it would be just about stripping, but it had a good storyline. I was pleasantly surprised. Add this one to your list to see!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I believe that it is my Kindle and not the charger. I bought a differt charger and it is not charging my Kindle either.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The beginning seemed so poorly put together.  It's definitely not as good as the Lord of the Rings.  I wouldn't recommend watching it if you aren't too in to the franchise.  I'm not and didn't think it was worth it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it... people would like to see where the rest of their life goes.... I hope there is a series for this
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have watched every episode multiple times. I can always find something new and interesting. I love the fact that you have to keep your head in the game just to stay up with the multitude of characters. Have read all the books so far, but wish that GRRM would release the next one soon. This is addictive.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is a great addition to the Google Play Store because Amazon has app's that do things that Google doesn't  want you to do. TubeMate  is one the best examples of this kind of thing. I highly recommend this app.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is great when I am sitting in the Doctor's office waiting to be called; a nice little way to pass time.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|That is about it.....it's just ok. I haven't decided if I will keep it or not. I still have it for now.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|I wasn't sure how this season would be.  Watched season 0 and 1 but wasn't sure how this season would be with the new actor as Spartacus.  It took a while to get use to him but I think he did a good job.  The end of the season kind of ended strangely but oh well.  I'll have to watch the next season now. Giggity giggity, giggity goo.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|I had this in the original version, but could not resist this one, remastered with a full symphony.  I cannot have too many Freddie/Queen CD's.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|it was good...it was a little slow, but I liked the characters, and the ending It was different from his other books
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was  a good book but I was a little disappointed with  the ending. It wasn't a book that was hard to  put down, you could kind of tell where it was headed.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Loved this book didn't want it to end!<br />It was so interesting and exciting at the same time.<br />I wish more authors were this good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon is more complex than Christian Grey! All of these books are greatness and highly recommended! Read them, you won't regret it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Good try I guess. It's too short, so the low price tag is misleading.<br /><br />The biggest thing was repeating words. You don't use the word indignant in normal conversation (most people). So when you see it rapid fire, 3+ times within a few paragraphs apart.. It sticks out. It's ugly.<br /><br />Everything is a bit to &#34;perfect&#34; as well.<br /><br />That being said I won't say it's a horrible book, just some flaws that make it less than it could be.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm only half way through and can't wait to see how it ends. It's so good I don't want it to!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Whatever task you need to do like wash then horse will say. 2 hr and it really means 2 hours.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|Normally I am a huge Green Day fan, however the over use of foul language made this Cd unusable in that I play my music where it can be heard in public. Good music, poor choice of lyrics.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Enjoyed reading this after my first in the series, though not as much. Still found it fun, the people and location descriptions again, stellar.  The characters emotional roller coaster rides were a bit disappointing, since they were the same as in the first book. While this was understandable since they hadn't gotton much older and they are teenagers, it still would have been nice if they had changed just a bit. That said, I still enjoyed reading it and purchased the next book in the series.
1423136802|5.0|I have this set in hardcover but I bought this paperback set for my son and he loves it!  I actually have my 12 year old reading and that is awesome
B00AZM7IQC|2.0|I appreciate that this movie exists, because some of the stuff these people do is INSANE.  It's AWESOME.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />As a person who has been corrupted by society, there was nothing in this movie that I haven't seen 100 times in other movies.  Special effects have ruined me.  I can still appreciate the beauty and the incredible muscle power it would take for these guys to pull off their movies, but I wasn't necessarily transfixed by it.  I would probably feel differently had I seen it in person, though.<br /><br />The story was odd.  I almost would have preferred just no story and a film of just the awesome gymnastics and acrobatics displayed.<br /><br />It kind of reminded me of Mirrormask in the way it's done.  Kind of odd and dark and a movie that seems like a kid would enjoy, but when you watch it you find that it's a little bit dark and twisted in a way that a child doesn't really need to be exposed to.<br /><br />Beautifully done, but just not something I was interested in in the end.
B0036R92V2|4.0|In 1966 the spaghetti western, that is westerns made in Italy and Spain, was just starting to explode. A different kind of western than was made in Hollywood, it wasn't just a cheap imitation as was dismissed by critics at the time, but a wholly new genre that was a cultural mix of two different nations.<br /> One title that stands out among the rest is Sergio Corbucci's Django. A gothic anti-western that caught unsuspecting movie goers off guard in the 1960's. It is brutal, violent and full of various sorts of symbolism including a hefty dose of catholism, it is also very entertaining.<br /> Starring a then unknown 23 year-old named Franco Nero. It would catapult him to international stardom. As a wondering former Union soldier in the days following the American civil war, who drags a coffin behind him everywhere he goes, Nero makes an immediate and lasting impression.<br /> Best seen in the spiffy blu-ray from Blue Underground, or DVD if you don't have the option, with the movie's original Italian language and English subtitles. Not only does it give Nero back his voice (he was badly dubbed in the English version), but the dialogue resonates better, it doesn't sound quite as stiff and wooden.<br /> Hugely influencal at the time of it's release, there are said to be as many as sixty movies that somewhere in the world was released as a Django sequel. It's still being felt today as Quentin Tarantino's just released epic Django Unchained follows Takashi Miike's wonderfully warped Sukiyaki Western Django by about five years. There is also plans to see Nero reprise the role, he already did once in 1987's Django Strikes Again, in an upcoming film.<br /> Probably more of a curiosity as of right now. This is a solid Mediterranean revenge sagebrush adventure. You'll be able to see what influence it has had over the entire output of auteur filmmakers such as Tarantino and Miike. If your interested in tracing their movie influences this along with a number of other Corbucci westerns is a fine place to start.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I have enjoyed this trilogy VERY much! I waited many months for this final book and was not disappointed!  I finished it last night and honestly feel a bit of book depression :)  Saying good-bye to some great books that I was able to lose myself in is hard!  Well done Lauren Oliver and thank you for the great joy I have had with Lena and Alex!
0385738773|4.0|I'll try to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />To be honest, when reflecting on this book I can;t really pull out much detail. They do this and that and finish off the story without any real feeling of 'umphh!' that i like to see in a book.<br /><br />It does well to sum up the series, but you HAVE to read the prequel in order to feel as though the series has done justice.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Winner:  Best Picture.  Based on a true story in 1980 when our Embassy in Iran was seized and the mission was to extract six operatives that escaped out the back door.  Very exciting and intense film.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Is there anything to complain about? Let the truth speak for itself and get it! Super useful I use it all the time. Great for kindle fires.
B00005UKLK|5.0|This is a great pressing. A bit pricey but so worth it to me. It is one of my favorite Led Zep albums
B009VMN3RA|4.0|What  a surprise! I have always been a Shirley MacLaine fan -- yes, I know she can be weird and kooky, but I LIKE weird and kookyi! I have read all of MacLaine's books and this one exposed a completely different facet of her personality and her life --  a story by her daughter, told from the standpoint of a child observing a parent. It's a totally different picture of MacLaine, and not a very flattering one. Before it was over, I had deep sympathy for them both. It is not a cheering-up book - if you're looking for a mood-raiser, this is not it -- but if you want to see the real cost of stardom and what it does to families and to parent-child relationships, this is the one. I still like MacLaine, but I see her in a different light now.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It is a very good game that I would diffenitly recommend to anyone that likes Mahjong. I have it on my tablet and play it when I am away from home. It's great.
0385742886|5.0|This book took me for an all out wild thrill ride and actually evoked quite a bit more emotion than the first three books. ONLY READ IT after you've read the set of three, as this one will spoil a lot of the stuff in the maze runner, the scorch, and the death cure.<br /><br />Seriously, my favorite in the series and one of the better ones I have read.
B000002KAT|5.0|this is so over due for a remaster-the Master tapes/CD are now 22 years old-crowbar that tight purse open Warner and remaster the 3 albums under your control
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book is a page-turner that really keeps you guessing.<br />I am recommending that you read this book for action, suspense, and mystery.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|My husband had seen &#34;Les Mis&#34; on Broadway several times and absolutely loved it.  When we met, he introduced me to the music.  Although I enjoyed it, the impact wasn't solidified till he took me to see it on Broadway for my birthday one year.  I was hooked.  When I heard the new movie was being released Christmas Day 2012, we planned to go (since our families were all up north and we were celebrating the holiday alone).  I figured he would be critical of the movie and not enjoy it because of his loyalty to the Broadway presentation.  Not so ... he LOVED it just as much as I did ... plus, I found this movie really connected some confusing pieces of the story for me.  We both just LOVED the movie and have enjoyed having the DVD and being able to watch it over and over now in the comfort of our home.  We were totally in awe of every aspect of this movie presentation.  We feel it represents perfection on every level.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Glad to see these characters return from Knocked Up. Superior &#34;sequel&#34; to original. Great story, acting, and soundtrack. Will gladly watch again.
1452110581|5.0|My cat Jack, who I had for 19 years, never peed on anything and a local stray pees on everything. At present I don't have a cat and what's worse, I never liked poetry.  How cats write poetry is beyond me anyway.  Both my sisters and their husbands catch cats and take them to the local spay and neuter (it's not a pub) and then either adopt them out or keep them. Now they appreciate cat poetry. This book kept them laughing for hours and appears to capture the essence of cat personality and foible.  If you have cats, or know someone who does, then this book offers a fun read and some insight about cat behavior.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris takes a reasoned, philosophical view of free will. Whether you agree or disagree with his thought process, it will challenge you to think carefully about the topic. This is what I expect from a philosophical treatment of any topic. It is a short book, but full of thought which makes it a good value not only for the price, but for the time that you spend reading it.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This was easier to read than I expected.  I wish every member of Congress would read it and follow Krugman's ideas.  I better understood how the economy got into the free fall than I had before.  I've already recommended it to people and bought a copy for our son.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a wonderful book offering insights, not only into what happened between Franz and Charlie, but also about the general conditions in Germany at the time of WWII. It is amazing how these two airmen met each other the first time and then the second time. The book keeps you wanting to read more to find out how both men manage to survive the war.  IT IS GREAT!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it.  I watched season 1 and season 2 in a two day period. I can't wait to watch season 3. I'm totally hooked.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My son love this movie, probably he would have watched more than 100 times already and going strong. I am not sure what would be our final score. I myself like the movie because of details, most of the animations are close to real.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was great! It started off a bit slow but not boring - kept me on the edch of my seat and ended with such a twist!
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Taking on the challenge of describing reality and how it works is a pretty daunting task, but Dawkins does it in an understandable, approachable way. As a physicist, I would have to admit that I didn't learn anything from this book, but I was reading it for appropriateness for my middle school aged daughter. My conclusion is that this book provides the best, most well rounded description of how everything works, from atoms to biology, that you can find in print. Since Dawkins is a biologist, it is not surprising that his physics in particular is a bit weak, but he doesn't hesitate to tell you that himself.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any students who feel that their science classes don't make sense, or seem to be missing something. This book should fill in the picture for you at least in a general way. It is worth considering teaching science from this book in middle school rather than the current texts. It is certainly better thought out and delivers a larger view than most textbooks today.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series! Drama, intrigue and more! Well written, well casted and well acted. My wife and I will be at a loss once we blister through this series.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Didn't know Albom wrote this until I was searching online for a good book. Never thought I'd read it in one sitting, but did enjoy it and the message in the story.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not bad, but not much detail. Would like to hear more on the training that was put in place for the raid. Need to read more about the build up...
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|Not as blusy as I hoped it be. Susan Tedechi is one of my favorite girl singers. Maybe she was not showcased enough.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Fantastic read.  Each page was full of the craziness that we'd heard about, and wondered about, but was now coming from KR himself.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|This historical fiction allowed me to experience a volcano as if I were there in that time. Wonderfully well written with an amazing ending. I love a good ending ;-)
B000NY12CI|5.0|This was a great book and I recommend it to everyone! I couldn't put it down and I learned so much! Every &#34;westerner&#34; should read this book!!!
B008JFUNPK|5.0|This is an amazing movie, funny with a lot of life lessons.  I watched it with my kids and we loved it, I couldn't keep smiling throughout the movie.  Never take love for granted, never spend a day without telling your family you love them.  Love people for who they are but not for who you think they should be.  Let your kids fly with their own wings once they are mature enough to do so.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|To tell you the truth, this is the second book that i read in the trilogy, because I started with the last one in the trilogy : 50 Shades Freed. I never start from the end, but I was hesitant to start with the first book in the trilogy due to all the controversial reviews about it . But after reading the last book in the trilogy I found it very exciting and got hooked. Immediately I bought the first book and started exploring  how, when and where it all began. And again , the plot is funny and sad, exciting and enticing. At some points, you just start skipping the lines because you feel that you don't want to read any mundane details ( which do exist unfortunately), you just need to go on and find what happens next. And when it ends, you don't want it to end, furthermore you don't want it to end the way it did, but; it ends exactly as it should , and your only hope is that there is another book to explore what happens next. In other words, cleverly, Ms. James does it again, and the reader is helplessly caught in the web of her 50 Shades. Bravo. I am getting the second book in the trilogy now. No need to waste time. My advice to you, buy the threesome as a bundle and start enjoying reading them.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie was awesome, but streaming through Amazon was horrible.  We have 12MB/s internet speed (very fast), rented the movie from Amazon through our Roku, and it still kept buffering and stopping and cutting out.  Amazon Prime sucks.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The movie fantastic Peter Jackson has surpassed his first. I do hope the actors will continue with thier excellent potralyals, however the case was split.
B008NMT684|5.0|Great design and lots of variety. My two year old's favorite. There is plenty of free content but we bought the paid version too.
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|Did not like it at all, very drawn out and boring,I was surprised Steven Spielberg was involved.......Bad movie, woul not recommend this movie, waste of money!!
B00498YZFK|1.0|Continually stops. I have to restart the video again & again. Gave me a headache. I WILL NOT ORDER ANOTHER VIDEO FROM AMAZON ON MY KINDLE. my friend complained of the same thing on her ipad.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|If you are a fan of Quintin Tarentino movies than this one needs to be added to your list. I am a big fan of this movie!
B009X01FJS|5.0|It really does the job of protecting my kindle. I literally almost dropped it the day it came in the mail, and this case save my life!!! I almost had a heart attack!! I love it!!
B004GYNPL2|4.0|I use this app to remind me of combinations and pass-codes for work and the Gym. I would recomend this if you need help remembering seldom used combos
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Anyone who enjoys brass jazz will devour Herb Alpert's &#34;Fandango.&#34; Crisp trumpet blasts with both upbeat and slower tunes are winners from start to finish. As a fan of Herb Alpert, &#34;Fandango&#34; is in my Top Ten of his albums.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Early in the book you at  meant to like Amy and dislike Nick. I was never quite convinced to do that though. The book is a little easy to figure out early on though the twists make every effort to be grand. In the end, I'm not sure either party was ever really lovable. The book is messed up on so many levels, which makes for an intriguing read for sure. Scott Petersen, the California man that killed his beautiful pregnant wife Lacey, comes to mind...but what if it ha  been somebody else? What if Scott was innocent? That's this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wonderful book could not put it down. Had to download the third book right away. Hate to see a good series come to an end.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I wouldn't spend time writing a review for most items, but this film is a &#34;must see.&#34;  I've seen it 3 times and have recommended it to everyone I know who loves film.  I know you will experience it as I did.
0439023521|5.0|This is another book I had to finish in one sitting - I just had to know what happens! It's a fast paced story, very well-written.<br /><br />I especially love the main character, a strong, well developed female lead.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|It has been quite a while since I watch a movie that demonstrated life during the 70s.  The many different views and images of NY brought back many fond memories. The World Trade Center buildings were showcased multiple times throughout the movie demonstrating the awesome architectural achievement at that time.<br />If you think you would like revisiting America during a time that is so different than today, then you should give this classic a look.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|I added this movie to my collection of Jason Statham movies and was not disappointed. Great movie with lots of action
B00000J7SS|5.0|I have it on vinyl and just love this!  I still play it (I converted it to CD-R manually).  It's \\"dated\\" (Fender Rhodes, etc.) AND still fresh as paint.  Love that bass clarinet crawling all over the floor (it's not Eric Dolphy, it's some other guy)!  If you're into music at all, you absolutely have to have this.  Maybe the CD is OK, don't know...I can crank vinyl, usually not CD's.  Put on your sunglasses, play this in your car (better in the car) and experience the world!!!!!!!!  Things are just happening!!!!
B0017I91LI|3.0|Good not great movie. I wa chosen for a project on ethics. I did not like the movie however, the content fit my needs.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved reading this book. l will remember the story for a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone.
1476733953|5.0|I ended up staying up late and finishing this book in a day, it was so engrossing.  I just had to find out what happens!<br /><br />The story is engrossing and the characters are well-developed.  I especially enjoyed the female lead - always love to read about a strong female character!
B00004XQ83|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and the receiver loved the movie so wanted the soundtrack. The enjoy the gift very much.
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Another great movie. However, I wont bother to do reviews anymore if the word count continues to be cumbersome. done
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very good game you can play for a minute or for hours can play a good game without spending a lot of money play anywhere at anytime game is good for very young to the elderly
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the best alarm app I've had yet...... it has great features and really gets you up in the morning......I recommend  &lt;3
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Big fan of the show. Couldn't watch this season, so I got it here. The video always looked good, and played well.
B007V65R54|5.0|I was new to bayesian math, and not sure what to expect. This book feels like it ought to make me a better scientist.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My boys like it, but they still play the original more. The graphics have certainly improved.  I like the original better too
B006P0FICE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because of the action and re-tellling of the basic story. Some interesting liberties have been taken with the period war machines, but was entertaining all the same.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|This book really ties the trilogy together. It didn't disappoint and I really appreciate the manner in which it ends... enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it. I laughed and cried. I would like to read a second part, something. 5 stars to this book!
B001NLKS16|5.0|I know that it wasn't completely consistent with the Supernatural Canon but it was good and my heart broke a little when they talked about Sam taking his first steps towards Dean
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The software seems OK, but the ads are a killer.  Every time you get going in the game, it shows an ad and breaks the flow.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I dont know much about it, but my wife loves it. She's always getting new ideas from the postings people make.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Great movie that I've seen many times. bought it to be able to enjoy commercial free. enough said about that
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie. A little long, but very enjoyable. I've added it to my James Bond collection. I'm ready for the next one with the new &#34;M&#34; and Moneypenny!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this highly amusing book and recommend it to all who enjoy tongue in cheek humor. Very funny read.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The movie was funny...but unfortunately I had to go and buy it because it never fully downloaded from Amazon and then they deleted it....I tried twice and they probably charged me twice also.... :(
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is so addicting! Starts off easy enough but progressively gets more challenging. Im not quite done with all the levels, but im gettin there.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Easy to down load and easy to use. Nice update of the world news as expected from the BBC. End
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|EACH Season just keeps getting Better !!  Looking forward to next season with Kathy Bates..  Maybe she'll bring her sledgehammer to break some knees ;)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|While I liked the movie, the book is much better.  The characters are better developed and and the ending is better in the book.  I recommend reading the book first then watch the movie for comparison.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Very well done, with great actors at the top of their game.  Of particular distinction are Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliott, Martin Sheen, and Richard Jordan.  I believe it is some of the finest work each has done.  Compelling dialogue delivered with sincerity and passion; this is a definitive depiction of the war between the states.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It held my interest from the first page to the last. I must say that I was surprised that I liked it as well as I did.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|This is a very colorful puzzle. It is fun and does take concentration and a certain degree of dexterity, astuteness of eye combined with quickness of hand. The price is certainly right.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show !!!  The acting & story telling will go down in history as the BEST Series to date..
B00992CF6W|3.0|I played it for a while and it was great. but now I'm kind of bored with it. Overall ok.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|I didn't love the ending, but overall, it was a very well done adaptation.  Peter Weller shows his range as an actor in making a convincing Batman.  The Joker is well done too, and portrayed as the homicidal maniac he truly is; no sugar coating it here.  Not really appropriate for the under 13 demographic.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|An addicting and intense show, no wonder I've been hearing so much about it lately.  I popped it in last night and couldn't stop watching.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|The whole band is good.  Brittany Howard is fantastic.  A unique band, getting better from the looks of it.  I like it.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Okay- watching a man play the part of being a woman is funny, but its also a little weird. By the same token, its hilarious to see a woman beat the crap out of a would-be jerk in an old alley, like a man. Worth a couple cheap laughs.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Wanted to get the whole series to have for the family and this was the perfect solution. Might have a little bit of problems with skipping but most DVD's do.
0136859259|5.0|this book is a guiding force to live the life we all desire.. in health, happiness, and meaning. I am on my path and the principles discussed can be applied to every day life and is simple to adhere to. Buy this book and work joyously toward the person you always knew you were.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|See how it ended.<br />I am pleased.<br />Surprised at all the drama but it was like all of the suspense was saved for the last book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book. It's talking about a boy named August. Some kids think August is different from other kids because of his face. He enrolls for a new school since he's been homeschooled, but he is afraid kids will laugh at him and make fun of him. Buy the book to see what's next!
B004O63TVS|5.0|Great price. I've already seen this movie but when I looked for it recently again, I couldn't find it. For the price, it was worth buying, rather then renting.
0618477942|5.0|I was predisposed not to be interested in a comic novel. Alison Bechdel though has shattered my misconceptions and has written an amazing book. It is literary memoir, the story is stuff of great fiction. Her timing is right on. This book is amazing, creative, moving with with descriptive particulars that suggest real life in all the ironic possibilities. I highly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down. She's smart, sensitive and inquisitive. This book is like nothing I've encountered before.
B004EF65QA|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I bought the DVD and have watched it several times. It's like visiting old friends. Superb acting, intense plot with surprising twists and turns.  I also read the book a couple of times and I know that Mr. Thornton never beat up anyone in the book. You'll be glad you visited Milton.
0312330537|5.0|This was a well written, intriguing story that induced me to go on and learn more about the author.  I look forward to his next novel.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not as exciting as everyone made it out to be. I was expecting something a lot better and more in to it
B0087HT36U|4.0|I have played through all available levels and really enjoyed doing so. Every aspect had been executed well. I honestly never knew that you could purchase bigger bombs and was able to finish the game without it. I could believe they are there but  since I never had to cancel out of buying anything I don't think it was intrusive. &quot;Ad&quot; for minclip.com at startup is just developer splash screen and standard for apps.<br /><br />I played through on a Galaxy S2 on subway trains and airplanes over the course of 3-4 months. Good times.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wow what beautiful color and the scenes were out of this world.  Had to watch it on my 47in. Samsung t.v. with 5.1 surround sound.  from amazon.com of course.  Just like at the3 movies.
030746363X|4.0|I was sucked in by the 4 Hour Chef first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I though I would give this one a go.<br /><br />I started the Slow-Carb Diet a little over a month ago and it helped me break through my weight loss plateau. I plan on using this diet for a few more months to see how it goes. I had done the no/low carb diets before with the typically lose it- gain it back procedure but this one seems to slightly easier with the cheat day involved. I won't lie about it though, when my coworkers come in with pizza or french fries it sucks, but you do what you have to do. The diet lays out pretty straight-forward rules for how to go about doing it so it makes it easy to distinguish what you can and cannot eat. FYI: Cheat Day = eat what you want day without any guilt for doing so.<br /><br />The book is more than just the diet. There are lots of tips on exercises, bodybuilding, some cooking, sex, supplements, etc... As well as the method on how to break topics down to aid in learning. I especially enjoyed the sleep section and have implemented parts of it with decent results.<br /><br />Even if you don't follow the diet or all of the tips in the book, its a good read and will make you think about things in your body and how your food/lifestyle is having an effect on it. For &#60;$20 it is worth a look.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Mr. Kyle gave a fairly good biographical history of himself.  However, it appears that the amount of classified information that had to be left out or otherwise obliquely discussed hampered his efforts at giving a full accounting of his time as a sniper.  This must have truly been a very difficult job under the best of circumstances and while the writing left something to be desired I wish to thank Mr. Kyle's family for his years of service to our country.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great hidden object game. Some objects must be combined or created, etc, to find them. Took quite a few hours to finish. Overall I'm pleased with the story and interactivity.
0689877692|5.0|My partner collects pop up books and kids are not allowed to touch them unless they pass very strict criteria! I love David A Carter books because they are modern and clever and intelligent and fun and wonderful and great and amazing and and and ......<br />have bought almost all of the colour series only have the black dots to go :)
0743201140|3.0|I was disappointed because I thought this was a new book with the key.  That was not the case and I had to go to another store to get another book with a key.
0307948110|3.0|My first Robert Harris book and I am definitely going to pick up another one. I liked his writing style, but unfortunately this storyline about midway through gets a little bit predictable. Its a quick read as well.<br /><br />I hear from other reviews his other books are better, but this one wasn't bad.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I don't love Radiohead, but I love this album. Each song in the album is good, unlike many albums where there's only a couple that I like.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I enjoy match three games. There are a fun challenge with out the stress of a platform game. This has good graphics.
0060245867|5.0|Five year old granddaughter LOVES it. Great illustrations by Felicia Bond A fun book as are all of Ms. Numeroff's.
B000006YO2|4.0|I must admit I am not in love with all of the tracks, however I did enjoy listening to the full cd on my stereo.  They are certainly good musicians, and I enjoy having them in my collection.
B007712XAU|5.0|We have been a fan of Dowton Abbey since it first aired.  We decided that we wanted to watch the seaons again so we purchased Seaon 1 and 2.  We cannot get enough of Dowton and now are patiently waiting for Season 4 to start.<br />I strongly suggest if you are interested in quality acting and story line this is series you will not want miss.  Just make sure you purchase the seasons you have missed so when season 4 starts you are up to date.<br /><br />Also a side note there is not another company as good as Amazon.  I am a Kindle Fire owner and would never think of purchasing on line from another company.  The customer service is by far the best I have ever experienced.
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|Pina - a film by Wim Wenders<br /><br />WOW!!  First, let me say I am not a modern dance aficionado, but after viewing this film (twice already, and in 3D to boot!), I feel a whole new appreciation for modern dance, and especially the works of Pina Bausch and her amazing dance company!<br /><br />This particular film by Wim Wenders blew me away!  It was beautiful, often heartbreakingly so, and occasionally even funny and whimsical.  Not only has Wim Wenders captured the beauty of modern dance through the medium of film, but he has hugely enhanced the experience by successfully and beautifully filming it in 3D!<br /><br />I didn't really get into the dances portrayed in the film immediately, but after a half hour or so, I was hooked, and had to keep watching to the end.  I decided to view it a second time with the director's commentary...and that really cinched the film for me.  Wim Wenders does an excellent job with his rather soft, even somewhat monotone voice, heavy with German accent.  He offers insight into most of the dances (extremely helpful for me!) and the development of the film, and via the commentary we learn why the film contains little information about Pina Bausch and only excerpts of Pina's wonderful works.  It just so happens that of the two \\"rules\\" Pina and Wim agreed to as part of their collaboration, one was that Pina wanted the film to NOT be biographical.  The other was that she wanted never to be interviewed.<br /><br />The dancers are terrific!  Such beautiful arms and deep expressiveness in each and every dancer, male and female, younger and older alike.  Of the 24 or 25 dancers in her company, most appear to be quite \\"seasoned\\" (meaning around 50 years old, or perhaps even older!), adding (I believe) a very comforting and satisfying depth to the artistic interpretations.<br /><br />There are even two brief clips of Pina herself dancing many years earlier, and she is mesmerizing in both short excerpts!<br /><br />The 3D effect is fabulous, especially in the outdoor scenes!<br /><br />English subtitles are provided but limited to sections where translation is necessary, and not available when dialogue (of which there is little anyway!) is in English.  The commentary is in English, so no subtitles there.<br /><br />I viewed the \\"making of\\" section, accompanied with commentary by Wim Wenders (not subtitled).  It is about 45 minutes long with very helpful insight into the intricacies of filming \\"Pina,\\" especially in 3D.  I had no idea how very complicated it is to film in 3D!!  Something else wonderful we benefit from by viewing the \\"making of\\" section is more dance excerpts of Pina's works, many of which are not included in the film.  We also get to see Wim Wenders in action...he appears to be a quiet spoken, patient man, filled with a huge amount of gracious appreciation for the dancers, his film crew, Pina's works, and of course for Pina herself!<br /><br />The one technical failing in the DVD itself is that to view the deleted scenes (all 14 of which are wonderfully included in 3D, and which you would do yourself a HUGE favor by viewing!!), is that Criterion did NOT make it possible to \\"view all.\\"  Instead, one must cue up each and every one of them individually, PLUS cue up the audio separately for each to hear Wim's optional commentary on  all of them (also a \\"must hear\\")!!  Doing so means adding a considerable amount of extra time to see and hear each deleted scene, but they are ALL worth viewing regardless!<br /><br />If you appreciate fine film making, wonderful modern dancing, and the potential to be moved to tears by the dancing and the sheer emotion of the music, treat yourself to this beautiful film.  Wim Wenders and Pina's dance company have presented it as a tribute to Pina, as Pina died before it was completed.specially in the outdoor scenes!<br /><br />English subtitles are provided but limited to sections where translation is necessary, and not available when dialogue (of which there is little anyway!) is in English.

B00BOLE7X0|4.0|Considering the subject, I thought it was very well done.  Historically, I don't know how accurate it was, but if the politics back then were as bad as they showed in the movie, then not much has changed.  Interesting story, acting was excellent.  Moved a little slow., but again, it was the story.
1476734941|3.0|Have not open it yet to begin reading but I am sure I will like the book, since I do my research prior to any purchases.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I liked the movie more than I thought.  It actually had a love story to it.  I would recommend it.
B001JI7WTO|5.0|This Is a movie I can watch 1000 times and still not get bored. Book Is awesome. But the additions to the book just made it great
B0000AYL16|3.0|This review is for the SACD version of this release. I have to say that the music contained is really great classic rock.<br />With that said, this review is mostly about the sound of this release. It's a fairly quick review. This SACD is very bright and left my ears ringing when played at high volume. It also sounds as though they bumped up the volume on the release some would call it compressed.<br />I really love the music but it just killed my ears with harsh highs. The current price doesn't make this an attractive purchase. Maybe it will get the shm-SACD treatment. 3 stars because the music contained is classic rock at its best.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have read the book twice and absolutely love it.  The movie was wonderful, music was great, acting superb.  I realize the actual book is quite long and I felt bad for those who had not read it because they missed so many details.  Leaving out the 8 yrs showed so much of the love and devotion as well as danger.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Amazing how he creates and blends the characters. The amount of research is evident and the events so real life like.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Part 2 is just as good as part one. All the characters come alive and show what England and the Aristocracy lived.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|This movie was entertaining and very well made. However, I can't rate it more than three stars due to:<br />1) The length: This movie was too long and drawn out.<br />2) Lack of cohesiveness: From the trailers and advertisements, you would think that all the stories in the movie were tied together in some amazing way. While there are some ties between each storyline, when I saw how it was all tied together, I was like \\"that's it?\\" It's better viewed as several storylines put together. Don't expect a great \\"tie\\" between each story.<br />3) I wouldn't recommend it to friends: While it was a decent movie, it was way too long. Also, as I noted in #2, the storylines didn't really tie together, so it was like watching several mini-movies that added up to 3 hours. I kind of felt like I wasted three hours by watching the movie, and as such, I would not recommend the movie to others.<br /><br />However, despite the cons listed above, I still rated the movie a three. This is because:<br />A) The movie was entertaining. Each mini story was engaging, and the characters were intriguing. Some had good suspense, others humor, some action, and most had some mystery.<br />B) The Wachowskis are talented film makers, no doubt about it. The visuals were great. Each world they created on film was believable.<br />C) The movie was unique. I haven't seen any like it. It takes you through several different stories, each set in a different time.<br /><br />The movie was good enough for three stars, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others. It's unique and entertaining, but definitely was not a must see. If you have three hours and want to see something different, this might be for you. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was decent. I just didn't think it was a great movie that should be on everyone's must see list.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I like how the picture quality is very clear.  I like how music and videos can be used on this player.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I was worried Hollywood would ruin this classic but they didn't.  I wish all movies could be made with such love.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can only repeat what I said about book one. A master story teller  with many more books to write I hope.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Had good story line, altho sometimes interjecting french seemed to distract my concensentration.It had a surprising conclusion, however I am aware it presents a compelling  desire to read the next novel.

B00633W614|5.0|My second Archer book and good as the first,, Only Time Will Tell.  Love the character Harry Clifton and keep waiting for him to catch a break.  Book is easy to read and keeps the reader's attention with the many twists and turns.

B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|[[ASIN:B00BEZTMQ8 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack)]]<br /><br />I am one of those in the minority who actually likes the movie.  I enjoy it more and more with each viewing and would give the movie itself a four star rating.  The one-star rating, however, has to do with the 3-DVD package, particularly the Ultraviolet download.  I have an Ultraviolet account and know that it is not compatible with my particular iPod.  That is not my complaint.  My complaint is that I paid extra for the digital copy, and, lo and behold, I cannot play it on my computer.  Why?  Because apparently there is a bug in the software with Flixster or UV which prevents the license for the movie from being retrieved.  So the downloaded copy will not play.  I have to go on-line to play it.  So much for portability.  Tech support says they will look into the matter, but that instills no confidence in me. It seems this is a common issue with Flixster as they have a post concerning the matter in their FAQ section.  Their answer is that it will be corrected in the next update.  Uh ... sure.  In the meantime, I recommend you save yourself the hassle and heartache and avoid the 3-DVD combo pack.<br /><br />Update:  It is more than a month later, an Flixter / Ultraviolet update has come and gone, and Ultraviolet STILL has not resolved the issue with the download.  DO NOT BUY ULTRAVIOLET UNDER ANY CONDITIONS.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONEXISTENT.
0060005696|5.0|If more people would read books like this one people might start to see what a rat race they are in and start to reduce their anxiety and stress levels over the absolutely insane number of choices we are faced with each second of everyday. May be one reason A.D.D. is so prevalent, which really isn't A.D.D. Per Se it is the inability to deal with the  the overwhelming and hyper-saturation of  stimuli at such young ages.
B00902AKK4|5.0|My favourite game. Had it on my Android first, then my kindle. Never a problem on either platform.  Can't ask for anything more in a game. More fun on the Kindle because of the size.

1250012570|5.0|I cannot say enough how much I loved this book. Just, wow. I just finished it and I am so thrilled I picked this up. I am a huge fan of John Green and when I saw he had reviewed this book, and favorably, I was so excited to read this. This book did not disappoint. It pulled me in almost immediately. As a high school teacher, Eleanor is a character I see in the hallways, and try to help. Park is one of those guys who does his own thing, goes his own way, and kids like him for it. What an eye opener for so many who didn't experience challenges in high school, who were the ones who did the bullying. An eye opener for parents who forget how to be parents. A look back at the days we were unsure and insecure. Thanks, Rainbow Rowell, for a great trip!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had forgotten it was a musical.  It is great.  Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were wonderful.  All of the stars were great , I didn't know they could sing so good.

0307474259|5.0|I've been a science journalist for most of my adult life. It's a tough way to make a living, but immensely rewarding as well. Gary Taubes is the whole package: a fantastic researcher, a lyrical writer, utterly objective and completely fearless. The toll the low-fat myth has taken on the nation's health is incalculable - as a responsible journalist, Gary does not venture into these speculative realms, but it's clear to me that low-fat, high-carb mania has done more than make the nation obese, it also probably underlies the epidemics of depression and autism. The dessicated human brain is 60 percent fat by weight, depriving the brain of this vital dietary constituent and flooding it with sugars and insulin has caused untold suffering.<br /><br />One more point - if you ever wonder why the low-fat, high-carb advice is so persistent despite abundant evidence to the contrary, follow the money. If you can persuade Americans to stop eating ham and eggs for breakfast and instead to go for \\"heart-healthy\\" bran flakes (or granola, or puffed grains, etc.) and skim milk, you'll make millions. The margins on animal foods are low, while on cereals, they are immense (a box of cereal that retails for $3.50 contains about 10 cents worth of commodity grain). Grains are fed to cattle to fatten them up cheaply, and do this trick just as well with people.<br /><br />More than any other person, Gary Taubes opened my eyes to the reality of what human beings should actually eat for optimum health. I've lost 25 pounds, but more than that, all of my blood work has moved into positive parameters and I feel great at age 57.<br /><br />Bottom line: I know how much work writing these kinds of books can be, and this is a great one. We all owe Gary Taubes our heartfelt thanks.

B009A87X80|5.0|Eva Cassidy's voice seeps under your skin.  Sad end to a beautiful songstress.  This is the best collection of her works.  Get it...you won't be sorry.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I first discovered Joni when I was a College Radio DJ back in 1968. I started playing her music on the air. To get her first ten albums for under $4 each was a great deal. I only had a few of these left on LP after a divorce when we split half of our music collection. Thank you Rhino for this set.
B000JLQS7E|5.0|I have to confess I have not watched much of Verdi so I do not have enough knowledge to compare and contrast. I also was watching sub titles the firt time through. Looks like I will have to find a different production and hope it is just not Giuseppe Verdi I find band. I know this 1985 but it has a 60's feel.<br /><br />This presentation seems a bit bland. But Stefania Toczyska made a splendid Amneris and kept you in your seat wanting more.<br /><br />Do not let me discourage you from watching as everyone needs to know the story and especially find where they extracted the Act 2, Scene 2: ....Triumphal March from.<br /><br />\\"Aida\\" an Arabic female name meaning \\"visitor\\"
B0087DFIYA|3.0|I've seen Mel in much better roles. This was just an ok movie at best. Wouldn't recommend to my friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read. Suspenseful at times, great love story. Easy to read and easy to fall in love with the characters.
0060207051|5.0|I bought this years ago for my children and then I bought this for my grandchildren. Children need to read this book. It teaches them to expect what is coming next, and when they learn to read, then they can expect what might be coming. When they are learning to spell, they can sound out words.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|What a treat for the Hendrix family to release new music two days before my birthday. I even pre-ordered it. The music still sounds fresh.
1609613937|2.0|It seems I have read just  the same information in about 5 or 6 books.  This just doesn't seem that new to me.  I hate recipes without pictures.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|A great series!  Make sure you get Seasons 1 through 4 as well.  The story lines are super.  Make sure to skip through all the beginning advertisements!
B005C9YZPA|5.0|I bought this as a small gift to open on my husbands birthday as his main present was an outing. He loved it.!!!!!<br />He was  impressed with the presentation and packaging due to the delicate items inside. My husband is a great fan of David Attenboroughs works and has told all his collegues and friends of this present. He loved the globe (planet earth) and was surprised to find the inside decorated too.<br />Top marks from the both of us.<br />Thank you.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a very good book, a little slow in the beginning nut then a page turner at the end!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch fans are among the most fanatical and loyal of any fan base for any band.  There's a reason for that:  Clutch is one of America's if not the world's premiere heavy rock bands ever.  Period.  It's a damn shame they aren't at a commercial level of AC/DC, ZZTop or other classic rock and roll band, because they belong there.  Of course, Clutch has always been a more cerebral outfit, with vocalist Neal Fallon's penchant for historical subjects, literature and politics, combining said subjects with a turn of phrase like no other.  Add to that his soulful powerhouse voice and a raging band, and you have pure genius.<br />  Tim Sult should be a household name in guitar world.  He deftly recalls the classic sounds, drenches his solos often with the wah pedal and delivers riffs that rival anybody from past to present.  Dan Maines on bass and Jean Paul Gaster are one of the heaviest rhythm sections out there.<br />  What makes \\"Earth Rocker\\" so good is a return to their heavier days, particularly around \\"Blast Tyrant\\" and \\"Pure Rock Fury\\".  Their most recent album, \\"Strange Cousins from the West\\" was a drier, sedate affair that lacked the power of previous albums, and apparently the band saw to fix it.  \\"Earth Rocker\\" starts off swinging hard, and you know your world is going to get rocked.  In fact the CD never lets up except for one slow piece, the very swampy and bluesy \\"Gone Cold\\", one of the best slower numbers in Clutch's history.  Every track is a gem and the whole thing is over in 44 minutes, a short album by Clutch standards, but it leaves you wanting more.  A lot more.  That's what great rock and roll is all about.  Do not pass this CD up.  It ranks already with my other two favorite Clutch albums, \\"The Elephant Riders\\" and \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\".  That's pretty good company for a band that has yet to put out a bad or even average album.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Guys! Seriously? Your app won't rotate on the Kindle Fire!!  Is it that hard to add that one convenience almost all other apps offer? Otherwise works pretty well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it! Several weeks of daily play with no glitches or restarts. If only every app was this worry free!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|THIS WAS ANOTHER FAVORITE OF MINE.I WISH IT WAS STILL ON I MISS IT ALOT I HAD ALL THE SEASONS
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I first saw The Godfather in the theater.  I was only 6 but my dad wanted me to show me a family film...I presume it was his version of a family film. It certainly wasn't my mom's who was angry with him for taking me to a film as violent, yet loving translation of Mario Puzo's masterpiece.  These movies changed my youth.  Although the casting of Sofia Coppola, in the 3rd iteration of the series was ok, Winona Ryder would have been better.  The Coppola Restoration was needed...be sure to watch the 2 extra discs...
B009NCM248|5.0|Stone Sour just keeps getting better and better. Another wonderful blend of melodies and driving metal.Can't wait for Part 2 to drop!

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|some of you guys would think this game is a total waste of money but I say it is not because it has so many levels and it has multiplayer.I have a psvita and I say its better than cod black ops declassified buts that is just my opinion don't hats.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|A great overview of the Dirty Harry series: 5 movies and a bonus disc which contains extras on all 5.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|This installment is quite good.  With every offering, their music gets more and more finely crafted and the tunes become more memorable.  They hit the bullseye this time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's a great tool. We live in Florida, and like to keep an eye on our always changing weather. We can also check on family and friends up north just by tapping the screen.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I can close my eyes and pick a book by Lee Child, and I would never be disappointed! I love the Reacher books, he's my favorite character ever, hes so quirky in his ways of life, and the stories are always gripping. If it has Jack Reacher in it, Or Lee Child on the cover, it's a guaranteed good read!
B000286RKW|5.0|I still don't know why this movie didn't earn an Academy Award for Martin Scorsese.  It certainly possesses star-power and wonderful story to go along with the performances.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|A Best Picture winner at The Academy Awards and it's obvious to see why.  The performances of the entire cast are superb.  The story is funny and filled with twists and turns.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I hadn't really noticed for a while when it first day. I. downloaded it and I wasn't real happy with it. Its not as good as the first one. I do give it a 3 for how it stuck with the same characters and I like the zipline but I hate how it moves all over the place. If it stuck with the same strait platform conelcept and not having things fly Id be happier. Its okay how its free. Even though I do have a high score over 1M I'm not impressed and I'm not scared to say I don't like it. I don't reccomended it. its been sitting in my inventory forever and it hasn't been touched.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The only episode that doesn't hold much is Episode 2. I couldn't stop watching after Ep 2 was over. Recommend it!
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Powerhouse performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.  If you want to round out your gangster collection, this one will fit that niche perfectly.
B000UJ48WC|4.0|Jack Nicholson at his best.  Shelly Duvall and Scatman Carothers also shine -- pardon the pun -- in this film.  Red rum. Red rum.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played this but it isn't as Good as The PC version. PC has more stuff. I did buy Pc. sadly its like $20 bucks more.
0312330537|5.0|This is the best novel I've ever read. Everyone that I've given it to has read it from cover to cover in ten days or less and it's 933 pages long. I like to read first lines of novels and compare them with the first lines of other novels. It's just a thing I do. The first line was the best one I've ever read. From there, I could not stop reading. It's a story where I just wanted to read each line to savor it by itself, and also to take them all in as an undifferentiated whole. This story made me laugh out loud, stop and ponder the universe and my existence, lose all track of time in page turning suspense, put down the book to cry, and to pause to give the words the full respect and consideration they deserved. I have remembered the characters and many scenes long after I finished reading this story. The author put his blood and soul into every line. Everything there is to know is contained in this novel.
B00B2064IY|4.0|Jimi.  12 newly found tracks.  Hendrix is a force that's unequaled in rock history.  Others try, but ultimately fail to do so.
B001KZIRL8|4.0|Super ensemble cast.  Lots of intertwining story lines and, of course, all ends well with nary a dry eye in the house.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was phenomenal! I personally only really read realistic fiction books and this one was by far the best I've read so far. The perks of being a wallflower definitely hit closer to home sometimes and that made it even more realistic/inspiring. I would definitely recommend this book especially to teens, but that didn't mean adults wouldn't like this book too. Honestly i think that a patent would be ablw to understand their child more if they read this. It was an amazing book and I recommend it to everyone!
B003MC5N28|4.0|Need a more specific ending with something more breathtaking. Love everything else and only found 1  yes grammar mistake :D
B00006FDCJ|5.0|A western like no other, Unforgiven rightly deserved the Academy Awards garnered by the actors and director.  It's unflinching approach to the glamour of the 1800s gunfighter was something unseen in previous westerns.  A must-buy for the movie-buff.
B000I5XOW8|4.0|Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are superb.  The story is great too.  Defintely worth an evening watching the TV.
1586217194|1.0|I have not been able to enjoy Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking since the first CD was missing!  I feel VERY disappointed and cheated ....
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I downloaded the game but it never work. could hear the music in the background but an advertisement screen came up and would never close out.
0783225792|5.0|Wonderful portrayal of the characters by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci.  The always unpredictable performance of Mr. Pesci's is fantastic.  A movie that isn't too much over the top as some critics have sometimes said.  Direction by Scorsese is always golden, but still no Academy Award at the time for best director, that would be awarded later in another movie of his.<br />The setting of 70's Las Vegas and it's Janus-like nature, was key.
B0012FE4BS|4.0|Before the glitz and synthesizers, these guys were a credible act.  This is probably their best overall effort.  Beer Drinnkers And Hell Raisers.  Indeed.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, and the best part is that it was a true story! It is a shame that we could have known about it at this dark period in our history. Great directing and acting.
141659521X|5.0|I just love all the Mitch Rapp series of Vince Flynn.  I even associate Vince with Mitch Rapp.  It will seem like forever before his next book is out.
B00003CXS4|4.0|A fun, ride not dissimilar to Lock, Stock...but a fun movie to experience, nonetheless.  Notable is Brad Pitt's performance as the Irish Gypsy aka Pikey.
B001YV504U|4.0|A movie that contains elements of a great movie about baseball -- but that goes much deeper.  Great performances by Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones et al make this one to catch.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Hey, it earned its academy awards. Stunning visually and a fascinating story. Watched it with friends in the big plasma and they liked it as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|like it so far but still early in playing it.  graphics are clear with only slight sqinting in the darker scenes.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I just needed a basic calculator and probably won't use the scientific side of the device. Cool skins. I should have looked for a Financial calculator (mortgage calcs).<br /><br />It's a good tol.
B000IOM0WY|4.0|An excellent heist film with an excellent cast.  Charlize Theron, Donal Sutherland, and Edward Norton Jr. (in particular) are superb.  Definitely recommended.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was bought for a gift to someone. I already had the collection. Don't know what else to say about it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Such a wonderful coming-of-age movie with fantastic acting and lines that really hit home. For anyone who has ever felt like there's no one who understands them or they're different.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Smart writing! Brought up lots of questions. Good character development. Highly recommend it! Don't miss it or you will miss out!
B0053YGYO4|3.0|A decent album but not as good as others in their catalog or other new albums by a few other artists.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|really an eye opener. I couldn't do what these men do, almost made me cry think what they suffered for our country then the little thanks they get, Should be a must read for all americans.
1616550414|5.0|if you love zelda games just buy it. they put the games in order of timeline to piece the zelda story all together.
B002CQUCDK|4.0|I've seen the 39 Steps before and ordered after a repeat showing on TV. It's an above-average mystery set in some beautiful areas. An Anglophile such as I will be thrilled. Robert Donat is unexpectedly handsome and virile, and Madeline Carroll is, as always, gorgeous. Solving the puzzle isn't as important as watching the actors and the film location, but it does offer some real puzzle-solving and a decent amount of tension. The loss of one rating star is due to technical problems. This DVD has such serious sound quality control that we spent the entire run of the movie trying to understand what was being said. Neither of us has difficulty hearing, but we ran the sound control from 10 to 55, back and forth, trying to keep up with the dialogue.  It was quite distracting and greatly diminished our enjoyment of the movie.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Not only does the Pogo cable perform exactly as promised, it arrived almost a full week ahead of the predicted delivery. And maybe it's just the gamer geek in me, but I was truly excited to see it came packaged in a dice bag complete with drawstrings!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you liked temple run you're going to love this one: better graphics, better sound and lots of fun. try it and you'll be hooked.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this book for my son's first birthday. We have read it almost every night since. I also have a 4 year old, and she recites parts of this book often. I love Sandra Boynton books, and this one did not disappoint!
B002YOJEES|4.0|I was surprised it was Mono, I thought it was going to be Stereo.  Wish there could have been some liner notes inside.  I always like to read about the band and the artists.  I'm still glad I got it.  I had this album a very long time ago and loaned it to someone who never returned it.  Just wanted it for my record collection.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|seems like everything dave grohl touches is outstanding; this isn't the exception. I really like the foos and nivana, but anybody who appreciates rock will definitely enjoy to play the full album; great compilation of artists, very enjoyable!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|this was the all must see movie event of the year!!! first time an all star cast bonded so well on the screen to bring about a feeling of greatness involved with a superhero movie. made me feel like a kid again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this because it got good reviews, sounded like my kind of book, and was a great price.  I wasn't disappointed! I enjoyed the characters, plot, and all the twists and turns that happened throughout.  I had trouble putting it down, and am sad that it's over now.  I will probably be purchasing the next in the series.
0785163174|4.0|I have basically given up on the X-Men for the last ten years.  I was drawn to this story not by the unfortunate taping of the over used Phoenix Keg, but rather the Oliver Coipel artwork (partial).<br />To my surprise the story was very solid and I found myself engaged.<br />Worth a look for sure!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story, I couldn't put this book down! It's a change from the new adult novels I've been reading, but I loved it!
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|once again Hugh Jackman puts on a great performance in this futuristic sci fi flick about boxing utilizing robots instead of the normal flesh on flesh violence. great concept. great supporting acting going on with the supporting cast. must see for all big kids like myself.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|the story is entertaining and the games arent easy or hard but they are fun! if you are looking are a game to play, this is the one!
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Best plot. Hands down. It's beautiful, sick and twisted. But this movie is bound to leave you breathless by the end. It's an amazing movie. And I'll recommend it to anyone.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a really cute, funny family film. Great story and lots of laughs it is great family film and really well done.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Watched the originals long ago.  After seeing Hugh Laurie in House, thought this would be entertaining.  Wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.
0767836324|5.0|Received this DVD in a very timely fashion and in excellent condition.  Love Robin Williams.  He was so good in this role.  Could watch this movie over and over!  No negative feedback with respect to this transaction.

B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I rented this really with high hopes and was not happy with it. I would never own this movie, it was just a movie about a wife who doesn't love her husband and so cheats on him and then never finds happiness afterward.
0792843584|5.0|Bought this for my dad who loved this movie.  Watched it over and over til he passed away 2 years ago.  Some parts are a bit long and rambling but overall a good story with good acting.  Loved the fiddler and the indoor roller skating scene.

0553386794|1.0|As a mother who screens everything her going-on-14-year-old daughter reads, I have been with her since Clifford the Big Red Dog through Junie B. Jones through Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, the Lord of the Rings ... and the one thing I'm seeing now as I read so-labelled \\"Adult Fantasy\\" is that many book so categorised  are more \\"Adult\\" (insult to more cerebral adults) than \\"Fantasy.\\" Or, to put it another way, when fairies start having sex, the magic just disappears. This is true for me, conservative parent, so although I LOVED \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles\\" until the third book when it just got too \\"real\\" for me to enjoy as a reading escape, with \\"Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire\\" it's even worse.<br /><br />Who wouldn't be interested in a book that's touted as being set in world as wondrous as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", been made into a hit movie series, and centers around dragons and wolf puppies and children who become heroes? But, really, not since \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" did I feel so manipulated by the marketing strategists of this series. It's perverse. If I were an author with a nipple fetish and a predisposition towards paedophilia, I may write a book disguised as a fantasy, with sword fights, rebellious kids, cute animals and feisty dragon maidens - but I would not, out of respect to Tolkien, ever permit it to be marketed as the next \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - or \\"Flies\\" for that matter.  As many other reviewers have noted, this is porn, pure and simple. As labeled, it doesn't even warrant one star. It will take me more than a while to get the images out of my head - I will never read anything written by this author again.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Funny jokes but each scene is way too long<br />Could have easily shortened the film by 20 minutes. Seemed to drag on forever
B0096YJDNQ|3.0|Finally, I am able to enter my coordinates for my home location.<br />Location based services also seem to be working for the first time.<br />Now the problem that really needs to be addressed:<br /><br />Since the upgrade, v.1.0.9, app is force closing approx. half the time.<br />Previous version never had this problem.  After two or three tries,<br />the app finally loads, and everything is wonderful.  Much better than<br />the older version just because the night sky is in the correct orientation.<br />I will definitely give Distant Suns 5 stars when these bugs are finally eliminated.<br /><br />And yes, I tried all the usual fixes for the Kindle Fire.  Uninstall and<br />reinstall, clear the memory cache, perform a hard reset, etc.,etc.<br />Nothing seems to eliminate this problem.  I guess I will have to wait<br />for the next upgrade which will hopefully include bug fixes!<br /><br />Update:  Same problem exists in v. 1.1.0.

B008220DGE|2.0|\\"The Master\\" is writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest foray into long, slow films in which the characters appear to be human but act as no human would and appear to live on planet Earth but, in fact, are denizens of a parallel universe that exists only in Anderson's mind -or did, until he unfortunately committed it to celluloid. The only time this approach has come close to working was 2007's \\"There Will Be Blood\\", which made no sense on any level but featured a darkly hilarious caricature by Daniel Day Lewis, whose talent was, incredibly, able to carry the whole mess. This time, it is left to Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman to carry the weight. Perhaps Hoffman could have, if his character had better dialogue and made a habit of histrionics, like Lewis' did.<br /><br />Shortly after World War II, navy veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) returns from the Pacific theater and finds it difficult to navigate everyday life. The Navy psychiatrists said he had a nervous disorder, which we would call post-traumatic stress, but Freddie was not entirely well to begin with. Now he's an alcoholic prone to violent outbursts who leaves a string of jobs in a hurry, until he stumbles upon a yacht belonging to one Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd calls himself a \\"scientist and a connoisseur\\". He likes to help people with their problems, which he believes can be solved through past life regression. And he takes Freddie on as a \\"guinea pig and prot&eacute;g&eacute;.\\" Freddie embarks on a life dedicated to \\"The Cause\\" and its master, Lancaster Dodd.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix received a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his role. Hoffman and Amy Adams received nominations for \\"supporting\\" roles. Dodd is actually a principle character. Adams plays his outwardly sweet but privately ferocious wife. Freddie isn't credible at all, but that is consistent with Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"style\\". Joaquin Phoenix is conspicuously too old for the role -which hardly matters, as he's not believable anyway. But this is a physically demanding performance from Phoenix, whose manner is gaunt and hunched to the point of being grotesque. I have always thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman should give up the frumpy roles, as he would make the perfect sly, ruthless villain. He almost achieves that here, but the character is too flat.<br /><br />There is not a lot to be said about the narrative, except that it is nearly 2 hours and 20 minutes long and contains a lot of filler. \\"The Master\\" aspires to be a character study of people who don't come across as real characters but are not cartoonish enough to entertain. All of the significant female characters are redheads. I wonder what that means. I'm afraid that's the most tantalizing question that \\"The Master\\" will elicit. It's one of those movies that critics like, because they can't understand it, and they're afraid that someone else does. But there's nothing to understand.<br /><br />The DVD (Western Film Company 2013): Bonus features include 8 teasers and 1 theatrical trailer (16:30 minutes total), a short film called \\"Unguided Message\\" (8 min) that takes us behind the scenes, and \\"Back Beyond\\" (20 min), another short film of outtakes and additional scenes that have been strung together in a semi-coherent fashion and set to music by Jonny Greenwood. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.atters, as he's not believable anyway.

But there's nothing to understand.<br /><br />The DVD (Western Film Company 2013): Bonus features include 8 teasers and 1 theatrical trailer (16:30 minutes total), a short film called \\"Unguided Message\\" (8 min) that takes us behind the scenes, and \\"Back Beyond\\" (20 min), another short film of outtakes and additional scenes that have been strung together in a semi-coherent fashion and set to music by Jonny Greenwood. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I like the pogo connector a lot. It connects to my N10 very easily with no fiddling, and if the device falls or I move wrong or something it won't damage the port, but rather just pop off safely.<br /><br />This cable is quite a bit shorter than the micro usb that came with the N10, which is a bit disappointing.<br /><br />I'll update this review with some charging time comparisons once I get the chance.<br /><br />Also, to correct some misconceptions running rampant on here, WHEN ORDERED FROM AMAZON IT IS SHIPPED FROM CALIFORNIA AND ARRIVES QUICKLY. People complaining about it coming from Korea and taking weeks or months to arrive ORDERED FROM THE MANUFACTURERS WEBSITE, not Amazon. I wish they would review the product, not the shipping speed from a completely different shipment facility...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best game ever! I love all the noises that it makes too. I love ho there are so many levels and you don't even have to pay for them!  I love this app! !
B00BF123WG|3.0|This movie had potential to be an awesome theatrical piece but fell short a few different ways for me.  First, there were moments early in the movie where I had a hard time following who, what, and where they were.  The audio was difficult to hear in a few of the whispers and I attribute that more to the way audio is put into movies for home viewing (voices too low and effects too loud).  In the actual assault, the scenes were dark, and I mean nighttime dark, in an attempt to give you a feel for what it's like entering combat in the dark.  And yet it was not enjoyable to watch.  They showed occasional night vision views but early on, there may have been several minutes worth of pitch black screen.  Really?  No thanks.<br />The movie was not totally accurate to the events that occurred but it made for good theater I guess.  It's not bad, but don't have high expectations.
0064430227|5.0|I remember reading this book when i was very young and how clever it was. It's about a little boy who creates his own little world simply by drawing it with a purple crayon.<br /><br />After all these years, the only part of the title I could remember was &#34;Purple Crayon&#34; and Amazon found it and had it in stock! Gotta love Amazon!
B006YC74E8|5.0|DO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE ONLY APP ON AMAZON THAT HAS A TIMER? I DON'T KNOW WHY IT ISN'T RATED HIGHER. IT SERVES MY PURPOSES. I NEEDED TO TAKE MY PICTURE. THERE IS NO ONE TO TAKE MY PICTURE THEREFORE I NEEDED A TIMER TO USE WITH MY TABLET.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case was easy to place over the Kindle Fire and provides protection for the faceplate.  it is easy to use and does not add to the space used by the Kindle.  Since it was on sale, the price was right and I am not sorry I got it.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The bad beginning was very cool<br />Happy and sad<br />Every part was good<br /><br />Beginning was sad<br />Also the man named count olaf was mean<br />Definitly absurd<br /><br />Bad beginning was just right for size<br />Every part was adventurous<br />Got to read this book<br />Impossible to not like<br />Never skip this<br />Never skip a single part<br />Indeed this book is great<br />Not innocently good<br />Great<br />:)

B00BF11STU|4.0|It was ok. but not what I thought it would be.When the choppers landed at OBL house,could not see good.
0061928356|5.0|I bought these for my children who are adopted from India.  It could have easily been their stories both as adopted children or as children staying in India.
B0076XDGZ0|4.0|Love all the artists and even the vocals. Great production and sound. Very good for first effort and hope they come back with another.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|best book ever to read. so easy to understand the hole story and even felt like you were part of the story... i really enjoyed it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Each episode leaves me anticipating the next and what will happen. There are many &#34;threads&#34; hanging and I can't wait to see what happens in the season finale. I would recommend this show to anyone who can take the violence and the blood.
B008220C56|2.0|Does not do justice to the intricacies of the personalities in the novel.  All the doorslamming between scenes was annoying.  It was set up like a play rather than a movie.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Saw then twice in concert (which is probably why my hearing is going). The critics panned them and the fans loved them and still do. They were a lot more than three chord bangers and the red album brought them to a new level of musical depth.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Just like part 1, I enjoyed this book. It had suspense, action and romance. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good easy read.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Contact is one of the best science fiction movies, very good plot, and some unexpected turn of events. I would recommend this movie for anyone who is into science fiction.
B0002T22R8|4.0|le style d europe se basait beaucoup sur le synthetiseur (c est pour ca que john norum avit quitter le groupe d ailleurs) mais cet album est plus basé sur le hard rock il y a plus de guitare un bon album de hard fm !
0345803507|2.0|I heard all the rave reviews on these books, how they changed women's lives. Well I read all three and can't figure out what they hoopla was about, they were cheesy and poorly written. The women that raved about them either had a very boring life or never watched a R rated movie in their lives.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the top 10 albums of all time.  A must have for anyone that grew up in the 60's, 70's or 80's.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|It made me think back on that night when the president announced UBL was killed. How the President earlier was at a public dinner event. Wow.....
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved it! I was in tears by the end because the actors/actresses did such a great job with the famous broadway musical. I just bought it so a definite 5 stars from me.
0345803485|2.0|Don't even start ready, a hugh waste of time and even more of a waste of paper.  Such a cheesy and poorly written book for such rave reviews.  If you loved this triology, you need to get out of the house more often and experience life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game. Just cu for those horse lovers that want a realistic game. You can groom, compete and just treat your pixel pony. One that anyone can play.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|At age 38, I really didn't think an old Disney movie could hold any charm for me. I was pleasantly surprised, enough so, that I decided to purchase it for my four year old daughter who is the reason we watched it in the first place.  Of all the characters, the crocodile is my personal favorite.  He puts a smile on my face :)  The ride at Disneyland makes more sense now, too --ha ha
B007HC3LHS|1.0|This book just wasn't for me.  I had a hard time getting past the first few chapters.  It just didn't hold my interest.
0307742539|5.0|This trilogy was fantastic!  Each book better than the first.  Don't let the size of the book keep you from reading, because once you start it's hard to put down.
B008NMT684|4.0|My sons loves doing puzzles, and he loves trucks so this was perfect for him! I did buy the complete app to get the extra puzzles, but it was definately a great purchase!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I saw this group on the grammys and liked them so much I bought their CD. All the songs are as enjoyable as the one they sang on the show.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|don't understand the scoring, but this is a very fun and challenging game. each level is a different setup,  which keeps it interesting.
0307949508|5.0|I'm reading the first book in the triology, very exciting, so I decided to have the 2nd one on hand. Found it at an great price and fantastic condition, you can barely tell it's been used.
0061655546|4.0|Barbarians at the Gate covered the largest leveraged buyout of the 1980s, the private purchase of RJR Nabisco for $25 billion.  The deal was a symbol of the excess of the 1980s when sources discovered that F. Ross Johnson had negotiated a generous buyout agreement for himself and his inside management team.  Business experts claimed that the new company - the private version of RJR Nabisco - was a poster child for the sickly balance sheets that resulted from these transactions.  The new owner had a 10% equity stake in the company. Most of the cash generated by the new company was earmarked for paying down interest on the debt.<br /><br />Leveraged buyouts were once the exclusive hunting ground of KKR and a few other boutique firms, but everyone noticed when former Treasury Secretary William Simon led an investment group that took the Cincinnati-based company Gibson Greetings private in 1982.  Using a million dollars of his own money, Simon purchased the firm for $80 million, and resold it a year and a half later for $290 million.  For the next five years, there was a frenzy of such activity as corporate executives wanted a taste of the riches that Simon enjoyed, and investment banks craved the fees that such deals generated.<br /><br />Ross Johnson, the CEO of RJR Nabisco, had initially rejected a private buyout of the firm because he suspected that such a deal would eliminate the corporate perks that were so important to him.  Johnson reconsidered after the stock price of his company sagged after the stock market crash of 1987.  RJR stock did not rebound to its high price of the low 70s, and Johnson searched for ideas to resurrect his company's ailing stock.<br /><br />When Johnson reconsidered the idea of a leveraged buyout, his actions brought together all of the kinds of characters that we met in [[ASIN:0553275976 The Bonfire of the Vanities]], the novel by Tom Wolfe.  There were the high-powered Wall Street deal brokers called the `masters of the universe' angling to manage the transaction.  Their 'agonizingly thin' trophy wives could easily pass for the social x-rays of the parties attended by Sherman McCoy.  These were people everyone wanted to be, or despise.  Either way, they made a great story.<br /><br />The remarkable deal had several bidders, some coming in late and others dropping out early.  Ross Johnson hired Shearson Lehman Hutton as its financial advisor, led by Peter Cohen, a newcomer looking to get recognized as a top advisor of LBOs.  Henry Kravis of KKR led an unexpected bid, financed by its own cash augmented by junk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert.  KKR hired Eric Gleacher of MS and Bruce Wasserstein to prevent them from being involved in other bids.  Ted Forstmann became involved in the deal, weaving fatalistic tales of the woes of junk bond financing.  Nobody felt more justified when Drexel went out of business than the former hockey goaltender from Yale University.  Jim Maher of First Boston submitted an unexpected bid, using an obscure tax loophole to boost his bud, and a cash infusion from the Chicago financier Jay Pritzker for capital.  Some of these bids involved runners racing through city streets and arriving out of breath to deliver them, just barely meeting deadlines.<br /><br />You can't have a shortage of egos with the giant-sized financiers involved in this story.  Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame baseball player and the `straw who stirs the drink' of the Bronx Zoo, was legendary for his ego.  Jackson thought he was so good that they should name a candy bar after him.  Well, the guy who followed through on that idea had a pretty good ego, too.  Ross Johnson helped conceive of the Reggie candy bar that Catfish Hunter once joked, `When you unwrap a Reggie! bar, it tells you how good it is.'<br /><br />Johnson is the primary character of Barbarians at the Gate.  He had a surprising rise to power as the CEO of a top-twenty American corporation.  After climbing the ladder at Standard Brands, a food retailer that sold Chase & Sanborn coffee and Fleischmann's margarine, Johnson merged Standard with Nabisco.  He took over as CEO of the food conglomerate in short order.  Johnson them merged Nabisco, an abbreviated corporate name for the National Biscuit Company, with RJ Reynolds and unseated Tylee Wilson as CEO not long after arriving in Winston-Salem.<br /><br />A quick examination of the shelves at your local grocery supermarket will tell you how this business deal went for the buyer.  There are shelves of Chips Ahoy, Oreos, and Ritz crackers at the supermarket, but there are more cookies and crackers from Keebler. Fig Newtons and Mallomars are harder to find.  RJR fared much worse in the aftermath of the LBO.<br /><br />This book has a post-script that outlines the results of the RJR Nabisco deal and the LBOs of the Reagan/Bush Era in better detail.  Helyar and Burroughs described the Marlboro Friday that reduced Reynolds cigarettes to an insignificant part of the tobacco market.  They described the problems that the buyer had in managing the venture due to its high debt.  Leveraged buyouts are called private equity transactions today and the minimum equity requirements are higher.<br /><br />The authors also visited Ross Johnson twenty years later.  While Johnson was vilified during coverage of the RJR Nabisco buyout in 1989, he comes off better in Barbarians at the Gate. If you were stuck in an airport waiting for your flight to leave, Johnson seems like a pretty good guy to help make the time pass.  You can call him Ross, and you can call him Johnson... but don't ask him if it's bucolic in Winston-Salem.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Same actor but movie is opposite of Quantum of Solace in many respects.  Great plot and great acting.  Plot and dialogue clear enough that you don't have to watch the movie 3 times with the captions and slow mo control to fugure it out.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! WE have watched it many times and it never gets old! Perfect for kids of all ages and it teaches great values!
0345803493|2.0|Don't waste your time and money reading this trilogy.  All the rave reviews must have come from a person with a very boring life
