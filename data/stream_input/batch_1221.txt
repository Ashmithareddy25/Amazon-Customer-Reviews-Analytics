0446547603|5.0|Since I picked up my first Nicholas Sparks book I absolutely fell in love with his writing style.  He has a unique way of intertwining the reader's heart with the characters.  He captures the reader's heart with his large imagination on how love ought to be.  I have read all of his books a few give or take and I have bought them.  I think it has been the best investment I have taken.  This book specifically has an amazing twist.  It is his typical love story with a boy and a girl.  The plot takes place in North Carolina, where all his books take place.  This love story is very different from his other love stories; it involves more mystery and foreshadowing.  Safe Haven can relate more to reality unlike some others of his.  He takes a journey through many hearts and interlinks them together.  He does think outside the box, and makes it seem like it's something what it's not.  He completely confuses you with how the story may seem to end.  He sends a thrilling twist and a beautiful ending.  I have shared many emotions in this book, sadness, anger, happiness and the list may continue.  In the end, I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait for his next book to be released.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|My daughter and I went to see The Informant, staring Matt Damon. We loved it. It was very entertaining. I have to say that we got a lot more out of it because we listened to the episode on NPR's This American Life about Mark Whitacre, the real-life character upon which this movie was based. The movie is not as detailed as the story, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />The Informant's Executive Producer is George Clooney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, The movie version of this true story manages to put a somewhat humorous spin on a very serious subject - corporate corruption. Matt Damon does such a great job acting here, that you never really think of the character as Damon acting. He even gained a bunch of weight to get a middle aged spread for the role, a common thing for actors to do these days. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, including Scott Bakula and even the Smothers Brothers!<br /><br />Imagine a corporate executive (Whitacre) who goes to the FBI (because his wife says she will if he doesn't) to turn in his colleagues at Archer Daniels Midland Company for price fixing. Whitacre becomes an informant for several years working magic for the FBI, completely fooling those who work in his company as well as business associates from around the world. But of course there's a twist. Whitacre is not being completely honest with the FBI, his wife or himself. Despite all this he is a brilliant and totally likeable guy.<br /><br />You'll walk away from this movie saying to yourself, \\"OMG, this is a true story, and Mark Whitacre is a real person, a sociopath who has no trouble lying to the FBI!\\" You'll also be thinking about how much we don't know about the companies America relies upon for food and other essentials and just how corrupt corporations can be. Oh yeah, and you'll be pondering just how it is that a man's wife can bear to stand by him through a lifetime of lying and cheating.<br /><br />So either read the book or listen to the NPR This American Life episode about it, and then go and see the movie. It will make you think a lot about corporate America, the stocks you buy and your hard-working corporate executive friends. Do you really know who they are?<br /><br />FYI - Children under 14 will likely not be too interested in this movie, unless of course they are fascinated by corruption or American business.movie.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game. It has lots of levels, gives great tutorial type levels whenever a new element is added, and it holds the interest of adults, and kids ranging at least from 5-12 which is the ages of the kids I have playing it on my phone.  There are lots of levels that are a challenge and some that are very simple. Some involve a lot of timing or strategy, especially if you want all three stars! I got this game for myself and also on my son's phone and paid for both and would do it again, so as the free app of the day it's definitely a great deal!
0061122416|4.0|While driving on a 40 hour round-trip journey from Miami to Philly, we listened to Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist on CD, narrated by Jeremy Irons. It was a fantastic way to pass the time, and is quite a story. And who better to record it than actor Jeremy Irons? He does an outstanding job!<br /><br />The story is a fable about a Spanish shepherd boy who meets several characters who encourage him to give up his present situation to follow the path of his recurring dream.  Along the way, he encounters setbacks, the dangers of the desert and experiences twists and turns in his plans to find love and fortune (and of course, to meet the Alchemist). The book is based upon religious parables and leaves you thinking about life, destiny and greatness. There are many excellent quotes, my favorites being: \\"Every blessing ignored become a curse,\\" and \\"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.\\"<br /><br />The best lesson of the book is perhaps that you cannot plan everything in your life, but you shall learn from all the events - negative and positive, planned and unplanned - that do occur.  After all, things happen for a reason.  \\"And when you want something, the universe conspires to help you achieve it.\\"<br /><br />The book has been scrutinized, criticized and loved by many, since more than 60 million copies have been sold in many different languages. But no matter what is said, both good and bad, I thought it was a most entertaining, thought-provoking story that is perfect for the whole family to listen to on a long journey in the car.

0440244412|5.0|I just recently read the entire series for the Second time! I read it all in about 2 weeks. As a single mom with 3 kids working full time, Obviously I LOVED it!!! Its the best series by far that Ive ever read. I wish it would never end and sh'd just keep writing! Hopefully KMM will come out with a new series that can captivate as much as this one has! The second read definitely encouraged an already deep love towards the author and the series. It also took me into the world all over again and showed me things I didnt remember seeing before. I hear the series might be picked up by Dreamworks so hopefully that doesn't disapoint. I say this series is by Far better then the Twilight series. More action, romance, and just plain emotion that you feel with the character as you read. KMM does an excellant job of tidying up any \\"loose ends\\" she creates while writing the series. LOVE LOVE LOVE, cant say that enough!!

0307472841|2.0|Henning Mankell is best known for having created fictional detective Kurt Wallander, a character I am familiar with via a couple of BBC adaptations of Mankell's work.  Wallander is typical of the genre, I suppose.  He is another of those broken down, older detectives whose personal life is in ruins but who gamely carries on with catching the local bad guys.  It is all very dark and moody, but I almost always take to that type of atmosphere and character and that is what I expected to get from The Man from Beijing.<br /><br />And, at first, that is what I got.  The story opens at the scene of a spectacular mass murder in one of Sweden's most isolated little villages.  All but three of the village's twenty-two inhabitants have been brutally slaughtered in just a few hours and police are struggling to identify either a motive for the murders or a suspect.  When Judge Birgitta Roslin, who is on a two-week medical leave from the bench, realizes that this is the same village her mother was raised in, she decides to go there for a personal look.  Once there, and sensing that the police investigation is headed in the wrong direction, Roslin begins her own - an investigation that leads her to believe that a Chinese assassin is responsible for the deaths.<br /><br />Butting heads with the local police, however, proves to be rather fruitless, so Roslin continues to nose around on her own.  Her amateur investigation brings her all the way to China where her efforts attract the attention of the wrong people.  Just happy to escape Beijing in one piece, Roslin returns to Sweden only to find that her Chinese troubles have followed her home.<br /><br />Henning Mankell had the makings of a snappy crime thriller on his hands if he had only stuck with this basic plot and characters.  Even the long flashback dealing with San, a Chinaman kidnapped to work on America's transcontinental railroad was interesting (and directly pertained to the plot), although, for the most part, very dryly narrated.  By the time Mankell got back to present day Sweden, I was beginning to get a little hazy on some of the murder details and the Swedish characters.  I managed to get myself back on track only to find that Mankell had a long, boring harangue in store for his readers.  The author managed to move the side plot along eventually, but along the way he had one of his main characters read segments of political speeches that in real time were said to last four or five hours.  As I listened to Mankell defend the likes of Chairman Mao and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, I began to understand how the character's captive audience must have felt.<br /><br />This is a good book gone very, very bad.  It reads more as an excuse for Mankell to preach his own leftist political views than as a book to be enjoyed by mystery/thriller fans.  Had The Man from Beijing been properly edited, it could have been a gripping police procedural about a stunning crime.  As is, it is a tremendous bore about a stunning crime.<br /><br />Rated at: 1.5got back to present day Sweden, I was beginning to get a little hazy on some of the murder details and the Swedish characters.

B00316DDUE|5.0|YANNI and his global hand-picked orchestra/band bring a vast array of superb New Wave music to a packed house at  the Mandalay Bay concert hall in Las Vegas. Each piece performed highlights the elite talents of various performers with him at the helm of conductor / composer mastery.  The show was performed as a TV special for PBS and does not disappoint it's live or TV audience.  I purchased the Blu-Ray DVD after watching the TV special at a friends house because I was so impressed with the quality of sound and talent displayed throughout the concert. If you are a lover of beautiful Instrumental music and excellent virtuoso performances, I highly recommend this DVD to add to your collection.
1601251505|5.0|I found out about Paizo, and Pathfinder system in 2009 while hunting for 3.5 books for my brothers in a FLGS. At first I was resistant to a new game system, but after finding that I could not get new 3.5 books, I broke down and got 3 of these books. 1 for me, and the other 2 for my brothers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Fixed 90% of what I didn't like about 3.5<br />2) Combined the PHB & DMG into one book.<br />3) Fantastic artwork IMO<br />4) Logical layout, and doesn't seem to be scattered randomly like older editions.<br />5) Makes the core classes viable.<br /><br />Con<br />1) The book is cheaply bound, but I'm ok with that, since it was monetarily cheap to begin with. Which is what is important to me. I have tape for a reason.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great book, and I recommend it to any older system D&D player I meet, and I regularily advertise how awesome this game is. Thank you Paizo!

B004XNGKBS|5.0|Works really well as a quick way to jot down notes by writing directly on your screen with your finger. The resulting &quot;handwritten&quot; memos are surprisingly legible and space-efficient. For me it's a nice efficient way to write a quick memo without generating hilarious autocorrect errors from the herniated. Um. keyboard.  It does not turn your notes into actual text but you can export a note as .png or .jpg.
B0051T46XM|4.0|I'm not going to say anything other than Troll Hunter (which is a Norwegian film w/ English subtitles) was a blind purchase, based on some strong reviews, and as an end result was absolutely spot on. While not a perfect film (hence 4 stars), Troll Hunter proved an excellent genre film, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I suppose the best compliment I can offer is that it's not often I hope a movie will not end. That said... Kudos to Magnet Releasing for an excellent blu-ray transfer, and if your like me, and have only ever peripherally heard of Troll Hunter, and have even the slightest inclination towards escapist fantasy cinema (in this case an amusing hybrid of LotR's, Blair Witch, and Spinal Tap), etc, buy Troll Hunter with confidence! Enjoy!

How about when Pac-man and Joust were the (edited) and you had to go to your local 7-11 or game room to play them?? Remember when you had to put your quarters up on the screen to get the next game and everybody stood around watching? This book brought back memories of that time. I've read the bad reviews. \\"No character development\\" \\"Same old plot\\" \\"Good guys vs Bad guys.\\" For me, this brought back some vivid memories of sitting at a table with my D&D group. To have the visual of entering, virtually, a Gygax dungeon, holy (edited)! *bowing* \\"We're not worthy.\\" It's almost too much for words on a personal level. I think that would be at the top of my g33k bucket list! Zork, my first true love of video games, when you had to create the scenery. (I can see the house and tree in my head vividly) I never beat it back then (I was 12 when my father and step mother introduced me to it and I was always getting kicked outside) but I own all versions of the game to this day. Cyndi Lauper,( \\"what time, I mean old Cyndi or now Cyn..\\" \\"Anytime Cyndi\\" Time After Time. I'm totally playing that at my wedding! I had all this running through my head as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep after two LATE nights and lack of sleep. While being drowsy at work, all I wanted to do was pick up this book or call off sick so I could immerse myself in this tribute to a childhood (now not forgotten). I HOPE I did this book some justice. I felt it was the least I could do. BTW I found your book by a plug on Patrick Rothfuss' blog (herein refered to as Art3mis cuz he's witty like that:)<br /><br />This is the first review I've ever written and am proud to do so!

0345529057|4.0|I've been reading books on the Kindle (and I love it!), but it was much cheaper to buy the paperback books as a set than to buy this series from George RR Martin in the Kindle version.  This is really irritating, but that's another story altogether.  I'm loving the series, it's one of the best I've ever read.  The characters are real people, with both good qualities and bad faults.  I'm always amazed at the storylines, Martin seems to come up with very unexpected plot twists.  As for the books, it's odd going back to having a book in your hands, instead of the Kindle I've grown so used to.  These books are all quite thick, 900-1000 pages each, and it's difficult to read and hold at the beginning and ending, because of the thinness/thickness of each side.  How archaic!  Also, because of this, I can see where they won't hold up to a lot of reading, the back's glue will eventually give out and the pages will start to fall out.   Bottom line = THE STORY IS FANTASTIC!! READ IT.
B005H1SDQU|4.0|As of course being a \\"Genesis head\\" dating back too long, I am always amazed at Steve Hackett. This man never stops. Playing,doing projects, forming new bands and now making a wonderful new  CD. This was well worth the wait. Textures,colours and the band is excellent! He is the only real \\"Genesis\\" person that is really trying to make that mark to be more known. In writing him and hearing his interviews via UK radio, he sounds like he really enjoys his life ,his music and now his new bride. The CD is totally fabulous!  Its always how Hackett \\"lays out the tune\\" is amazing.   The hard textures down to the soft progression that you would miss if you were not listening closely. For people just discovering Steve Hackett. Go back and listen to \\"Ace of Wands\\",then maybe \\"Cured\\",then this one. My hat is to you my friend,well done on this new release! One note on listening to Hackett cd's. You have to listen to them much more than once to an over all \\"picture\\" of what Mr. Hackett creates . Just wonderful.......

As fun and cute as the game is, until an update fixes this, I can't give it sky higher than a 1 star, based purely on the reboot issue.

0553386794|3.0|Had high hopes for this book and indeed the series but was rather disappointed.<br /><br />It's a good, covnicing story, quite complex with several sub-plots. As the title implies, it's about politics and power games in a realistically gritty medieval setting at a time when most such issues were settled by wars.<br /><br />The author does a good job of juggling and developing all the threads he's got going but ultimately it's not an appealing story and the telling of it is rather long-winded so it feels like a slog. The writing is good but not sufficiently so to charm me and draw me in.<br /><br />Realistic characters, well developed but I didn't really connect with any of them - except perhaps the bastard and the dwarf - to really care what'll happen to them. Untypically for a book of its kind none of the heroes are sacred and many aren't necessarily spared a bad (often terminal!) fate which comes as a refreshing surprise.<br /><br />I'm somewhat intrigued to know how it all pans out so I wouldn't mind if someone summarised the outcome but I don't feel I want to savour each development and make it last. (Mind you, given the size of the series which is in fact yet unfinished, even a summary would be pretty long!)<br /><br />I suspect the HBO series will be easier to follow and may well serve as the shorter version I'm looking for. Just started it: it has potential but it's too early for a clear verdict. But I definitely won't be reading any more of the books. Got the idea and I'm happy to move on.

B0031TZ98K|5.0|I'm not much for reading short stories but I read this collection compulsively until it was finished. It's a stunning set of stories that reminded me a lot of the writing of Flannery O'Connor. The Catholic angle is missing but the gothic is at the forefront. Like O'Connor a kind of redemption seems to be gained by at least some of Munro's characters. Munro has such a deep and mature insight into human psychology and behavior especially the kind that is driven by meanness, guilt and unhappy life experiences. I found myself relating some of this to my own life and nodding at how right she is about the vaguaries and transitoriness of human existance. A turn of the dime and you too could have a criminal in your kitchen threatening you with a knife.  This isn't a book for the faint-hearted or for light bedtime reading though. Expect to be shocked. If you want to read pretty stories leave this collection on the shelf.

B004SBBDB2|4.0|This cord, although some may think it's a bit expensive at 25 bucks, takes the place of all the cables I need for my Apple components.  If you bought them all separately, it would be more money.<br /><br />I like that it has the ability the be \\"the cord\\" and the only cord you need.  Plug one end into your Apple device and the other into whatever other device that you want to use.  It has a USB for the computer, audio and video jacks to plug into a TV for viewing videos or pictures, and analog audio to plug into a home receiver.<br /><br />The one drawback is that it has all those cables in one.  So using it in the car works fine, but the other five jacks will also be there, hanging from the USB port from the car.  No big deal really, but the regular, simple USB/Ipod cable is a little more neat.  Small drawback.<br /><br />And amazon isn't kidding about the simple, easy, no frills packaging.  It comes in a small cardboard box with its name, an Amazon logo and a certified seal of frustration free packaging.  Open the box, and you're ready to go.<br /><br />It worked well on everything I tried.
0385534639|5.0|If this, like To Kill a Mockingbird, is the only book she ever writes, it will be enough.  I am glad I lived long enough to read it.  As a book of fantasy, it compares to Mark Helprin's Winter's Tale and that is the highest recommendation I can give.
B00009UTQD|5.0|I very much prefer this filter holder to the traditional \\"wallet\\" style holders for a number of reasons. First off, I'm not a person who usually uses filters at all, but there are a number of times when I really wish I had brought along an ND or polarizing filter for an outdoor shot. Grabbing a filter from this pack takes 5 seconds and doesn't interrupt the flow of the shoot like opening up a wallet or fishing a case from a bag does.  It can attach to a belt or camera bag strap using the beefy velcro + snap latch on the back, which is cool because most of the time, the filters stay at home anyway. Construction is sturdy canvas, and the padding between compartments is beefy. I leave my most commonly used filters in here with a microfiber cloth to clean them off in between uses.   I'd definitely recommend this guy to anyone who needs fast and easy access to filters. Everything about the bag is quality, just like my other Tamrac stuff.

B005IZLPMY|1.0|I was so amped to see this film; so much, that I decided to attend a drive-in to watch it.  What a waste of time and money.  This movie has to be the most horribly produced superhero pic in history, aside from it predecessor.  Captain America desperately lacks action, action....action! This is a primary requirement for superheroes, especially ones that debut in the summer.  Whoever gives this movie a four or five star rating was likely watching this film with sleeping masks on. I recently viewed Thor and it was much better viewing than this pic.  We could have done without this film, altogether. It just felt rushed, rammed together for the Avengers movie. Sad outing for a well-loved hero.  Doesn't deserve a sequel.  Joe Johnston(The Rocketeer) was definitely the wrong director for this movie...he's known for idiotic blunders like this one. Make it a Redbox night for this one if you want to take a chance on it. I wish I had.

I am not a comic book guy, so I can't discuss any narrative issues, but I struggled to keep my eyes open for the last 2/3 of the movie. The story & its characters were weak, and I found the special effects to be bright, shiney, and stuff I saw in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the Dark Knights & X-Men (First Class in particular) and don't understand why these two very successful but different movies aren't setting the pace for those making the Green Lantern, Thor, & Captain America all but unwatchable. I am very nervous about the Avengers.
B004US4K2C|5.0|So, I have an Evo 3D.  At first, I liked the \\"sense\\" interface. After a while though, I wanted to make my phone my own. this was the perfect option. Absolutely love it and am still surprised it's free. It's also well supported and has many themes and widgets built for it. Love it.
034552554X|5.0|I loved this book on two levels - maybe more if I stopped to think about it.  There is the story that satisfies our love of a good tale.  Then there is the love of words that delights me.  I usually loan good books to friends and relatives.  This book I am not letting go of until I have read it a second time.  S.K.
B003GDYN24|5.0|Didn't give this album much at first but then on a roadtrip up to PA I gave it a run through and was hooked. All the songs are catchy with some unique beats that feel amazing. The segues between the songs are just as great, takes you out of the song and easily draws you into the next. I find myself going back to this album a lot, it just has such memorable rhythms. Only negative, I wish there were a few more tracks, guess I'll have to wait for the next album!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Puzzle games on the Android are a dime a dozen these days and it's rare for one to stand out from the pack. Cut the Rope is such a game. It draws you in with its crisp visuals and cute protagonist, Om Nom, but keeps you hooked with excellent puzzles that leave you wanting to try just one more.  Like many puzzle games, you can get up to a three start rating per level. However, unlike certain furious fowl, the stars aren't earned due to random chance and the whims of some physics deity. Instead, all three stars are in every level and it's up to you to figure out how to collect them. The goal is to slice and dice, poke and prod the candy into Om Nom's mouth, but the real challenge is collecting all three stars in the process.   The game's cute trappings would mean nothing if the puzzles weren't so excellently designed. You start off practicing the basics, cutting ropes, but as you progress, new ways to manipulate your environment are introduced. You start with what amounts to a training level and build your way up to tougher challenges. Out of the many puzzles included, I only ran into one or two that I felt relied too heavily on chance or super human speed. Otherwise there was a good mixture of straight forward puzzles and ones that required a little lateral thinking.  If you enjoy puzzle games, especially ones with this much polish, then don't miss out on Cut the Rope. At either price of free or $0.99 it's a great deal.  (I played the crap out if this game on a Droid Incredible and had no issues.)
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This is the easiest and best application of it's kind I have found. I love it and would recommend it to ANYONE. No problems encountered and easy to use.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I loved swype until I tried this. Easy to type. It does an excellent job predicting what I'm trying to type even when I type the wrong letters. I can type much faster with this keyboard than I could with swype.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Was waiting for this to be free app of the day. Really awesome game to kill time. Download and install it. Slow loading time on captivate.
6301174240|5.0|I used to have a copy of this video and I'm not sure where it dissapeared to but I just HAD to get another copy!! I have been looking for one that was decently priced (rather than hundreds of dollars since he passed away in 2009) and I finally found what I was looking for.  Moonwalker was an awesome \\"mini movie\\" and extremely advanced in the world of video-making for the time this was created. I thoroughly enjoyed this when it first came out in the mid- to late 80's and I still enjoy it just as much now.  I couldn't WAIT to show it to my 12-year-old.  He asked, \\"How did Michael Jackson make this? I thought he died?!\\" I had to tell him that it was made long before he was born.  It is just an awesome video and the songs are great as well. I don't think you have to be a die-hard MJ fan to enjoy it.  Fantastic! I would buy it again in another 50 years!!
1419702203|5.0|This is the companion book to the Martin Scorsese documentary.  Olivia Harrison has been very generous in putting together this lavish book.  She has provided a huge number of personal photos of George in non-public settings:  very early Harrison family photos, from his 1963 trip to the US, at Friar Park, in India.  There are early photos from The Cavern and The Star Club and from Australia.  There are copies of correspondence including a wonderful letter from John Lennon to Mrs. Harrison from Hamburg.  It is a coffee table sized book that runs to nearly 400 pages.  Everything is beautifully presented.  This is a real treasure. The photos are stunning and thre are very few that have been seen before.  This is an essential book for George fans and Beatle fans.  It is amazing tha 48 years after the start of British Beatlemania that we could have this wealth of previously unseen, high quality material.  Olivia Harrison has my heartfelt appreciation for sharing this with the fans.  This is a real labor of love.  Hundreds and hundreds of books have been published about The Beatles.  This is one of the very best.  Very highly recommended.
0142000655|5.0|It's a big, masterful book written in commanding prose and it overflows with big issues. The big psychological and moral ones as they occurred to me were: 1.) Acceptance and rejection by God and father, 2) nature-versus-nurture and \\"Timshel,\\" and 3.) the contrast of the self-imposed suffering from living a lie (Trask) versus the natural suffering experienced by an open and loving family (Hamilton). These are good big themes; everybody suffers about in equal measure and the West is opened. To explore the established major themes in East of Eden, you can borrow your kid's Cliffs Notes and see charts of the parallels to the Bible.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this was written in the era when the relatively new concept of \\"psychology\\" was emerging into the American consciousness. Before this time we just worked and, if the mule didn't go lame, we ate- all angst was real and there wasn't the luxury of pondering psychology.<br /><br />The real meat and potatoes of this huge 20-year story lie in the expertly crafted telling of daily life at the opening of The American Century. The dramatic unraveling of the Trasks and the decent but painful lives of the Hamiltons are deeply driven by the yielding of the fathers' horse-and-buggy era values to the relentless societal pressures at the onset of the 20th century. Steinbeck creates a beautifully detailed log of the period, a movie for the mind shown in the sharpest contrast and brilliant color. The delightful character of Lee, the Trasks' Chinese-American servant, forms a perfect fulcrum.  Through his enduring wit and insight as an outsider we see the Trasks in perspective, not just a family in crisis but as symbols of the crash of the polite balance of the 19th century as World War I looms and global thinking arises. I can think of no other character that better fulfills this role except perhaps Tyrone Slothrop in Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Both of these great novels tell of a transformation in American values in a period ofrapid change (relative to their era). Both are the masterworks of their respective times and authors.<br /><br />It seems clear at the end of the tale that Caleb Trask sets forth from his troubled Eden with the beautiful Abra, after shattering his brother and father's dream world resulting in their destruction. This escape troubles me and is made only a little more tolerable through the allusion to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Cal is left to deal with his evil side and bear the burden of his sins as was Cain. He hasn't departed his father's home with any clear moral lesson, so where is the mark on this latter-day Cain that he should receive from his father that will protect him from the \\"curse that is too strong?\\" The film is killer; Elia Kazan nailed it  casting James Dean as Cal, masters of unresolved tensions but he rather blurred the ending.
0385534639|4.0|No doubt Morgentstern is a skilled writer with the ability to transport the reader into her dark, magical world. Her description are lush and evocative, so vivid that I expected a bit more from her characters, but I felt a distance with them that I did not feel with the setting. In fact, the setting seemed more real that the feuding magicians.<br /><br />It's a great idea, and a wonderful world that Morgenstern creates. I wish she would have flushed out the characters a bit more. I think then it would have gone beyond a good story in a beautiful reality, to an ageless, remarkable book.
1401310400|1.0|I agree with ALL the negative reviews.  I love the TV series and looked forward to reading the first book in the series. The story was pitiful, the writing was juvenile (without any skills). Whoever actually wrote this should be ashamed. The plot was an absolute failure. Perhaps the author was trying to pass a freshman high school class  with this attempt.  I purchased the paperback and the print was so small and at some places faded and unreadable  I am so glad I did not purchase a hardback copy when tempted after I first watched the TV show.  I will not waste my time or money on any subsequent books in this series.  The best thing to be done would not to publish anymore.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Works fine on Incredible running 2.2. Smooth game play. Just played through the entire cardboard box &amp; 1/3 of the way through the fabric box. No force closes or restarts. Pretty fun time.
B005P5TS5I|4.0|I've watched the first episode a couple of times now and I must say that this is a good start out of the gate. I've always loved the opening segments, \\"the road so far\\". It gives an overall picture of where \\"the boys\\" have been on this weird and wonderful journey. The wall in Sam's mind is now gone, he's having odd feelings that something is near him, but he can't quite get a grip on seeing it. Dean has no idea that his brother is having hallucinations, until Death spills the beans. Dean, Sam and Bobby try to figure out how to derail Castiel's god complex without killing him in the process. It seems that Death has an answer for that question too. There's a neat little plot twist concerning Cas that I didn't see coming.  All in all, I thought the premiere of the seventh season set us off at a good pace with lots of directions to travel in. The Impala is off and running...again!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Bought this two days ago.  Kids love it, I love it too.  Worth more than $0.99. You can get it for free today.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|I have played this continuously since I got it.  Heard it first years ago, when I got the DVD, but wanted to just hear the music.  It is awesome!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I found the premise to be fresh and well thought out. The characters are both believable and easy to like. I don't find the modern novels need to give even the hero a dark twist to be either enjoyable or frame a more believable individual. Many of the people I know are truly just nice, I consider myself to be a kind individual I do not see why the primary antagonist in a novel cant be. The ending did however leave a little to be desired. On the whole I thoroughly enjoyed it and think you will as well.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|if it would work with a stylus, would be acceptable .  large hands simply aren't suitable to work with the interface.
B0058VW36U|1.0|why put up a app that's free already ??? I can just go the the market sand get it .very disappointed ..
B0058VW36U|2.0|was so happy hat this was the free app of the day until i down loaded. all i can see are the ropes and candy its angry birds all over again. please fix!!!!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Love this movie....it is computer generated and the characters look real. If you like the Polar Express you will also enjoy this movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Can't say enough about this game! I brought it when it first came out and loved it ever since. The graphics are well done and the concept is  unique runs great on my optimus v.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is by far the most addicting game since Angry Birds. You MUST try it out! Five stars for sure!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Okay so Chickenfoot III has finally arrived an in today's market of supposed supergroups Chickenfoot really stands on it's own.  Their first release was a breath of fresh air for the limited hard rock scene. The album has been released in four different releases but seriously do yourself a favor an get the reg ed.  The inside is cool with 3-D glasses with four band photos of each member with stats such as riffs played in a nite etc... an this is really a great value for the price of a reg ed of a new release (Heck I have purchased deluxe ed of other CD's that different offer such value) Don't buy the Deluxe Ed unless your just dying for more of the same commentary of behind the scenes footage of the band making this album an it has zero bonus tracks)~ SAVE YOUR CASH BUY THE Standard Ed release. I loved the original album and I own of copy of the second Chickenfoot release which was a (extra track bitten by the wolf & a DVD w/white coverart) but Chickenfoot iii is in a class of it's own.  Personally this is the best work that Sammy and M. Anthony have ever done together.  Sammy Hagar is singing better then he has in years, his song writing is great along with M. Anthony now singing two part harmonies & playing a louder more in the fore front bass then in the original release.  The original chickenfoot album had more of a Joe Satriani feel to it an this album simply has more of a Van-Hagar feel.  By that I mean simply that the song writing, vocals, bass, and guitar work are more refined and built to work within songs more then to simply showcase Satriani's skill set of crazy multiple riffs not to bash Satriani(he is the main reason this band exists) at all but this has more of a Van - Hagar feel.  Highlights include \\"Big Foot\\" \\"Different Devil\\", \\"Come Closer\\", an lastly \\"alright, alright\\". Really their are ZERO you heard it, ZERO bad songs on this album.  BUY IT NOW !!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Dinc2 and no lagging or load issues   A clever puzzle game that will keep you busy. It was only a matter of time before this one became free. Hopefully the cheap kids will shut up for a while.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I knew nothing about this release, and came across it in a top 10 Blues Albums list today. Without hesitation, I bought it. There was something about the House episode where Hugh Laurie did a musical number that absolutely captivated me. The talent and passion exhibited in this album is unbelievable! On my first listen of the album, I found myself smiling, tapping my foot, I even got the goosebumps a couple of times. I am halfway hoping to get stuck in traffic on my way home so I have a little more listening time. Well done, Hugh! Well done!
0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist is the literary equivalent of a Disney movie, and I mean that in a good way:  it's a light-hearted yet thoughtfully constructed fable that touches readers on an emotional level.  Reading this book will certainly remind you that even if you don't follow your dreams, they stay with you throughout your life.  The Alchemist only takes a couple of hours to read and, if nothing else, is a cleverly-crafted story.  Some readers might find its message to be life-changing.  So, what the heck--go ahead and follow your heart if it's telling you to read this book.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|SotC and ICO are truly inspiring. These much loved classics are praised for their innovation, and have revolutionized video games everywhere. I can't tell you how many times I've played a newer game that had some bosses whose sheer towering size and method of defeating them can only be a SotC influence. So often these games are copied, or borrowed from, but nothing can compare to the originals.   SotC was beautiful on ps2, and it still holds that same beauty, with higher resolution and faster framerate. The experience is still pure, but the visuals that can be displayed have improved.  If you are tired of familiar, mundane experiences in video games, give these both a try; games can be more than entertainment, they can be art and beauty, and beautiful story telling all rolled into an immersive and fun experience.
0307279189|4.0|This book explores the idea that even middle-aged, slightly overweight joggers can transform themselves into lithe, injury-free ultra marathon runners simply by applying ancient running wisdom to their lifestyle.  This book follows the author on his journey deep into Mexico's Copper Canyon, where he searches out an ancient Native tribe whose cultural tradition center around running fast and far through the canyons.  Once he finds them, he tries to learn their running techniques and apply them to his own running.    Basically, this journey leads him to become a strong proponent of running in very minimalist shoes, among other things.  He pushes his point of view on the readers so strongly that reading this book left me feeling confused and conflicted about even the simple act of wearing running shoes instead of sandals or \\"barefoot shoes\\"!  Maybe the author is sponsored by Vibram Five Fingers shoes?   However, as strongly as he may feel about what he learned during his time in Mexico, this book did not seem to be very meticulously researched.  So, although there is some very interesting food for thought outlined in this book, it certainly has to be taken with a grain of salt.  Runners will probably find this book really interesting but non-runners may find it to be a bit slow-paced and repetitive. Though it is supposed to be an adventure book, in addition to a book of running lore, there isn't too much action conveyed through the author's storytelling.
0345529057|4.0|Entertaining and engrossing. Unusual, possibly due to its being first book in a series. Most reads like a historical novel, although in a fantasy setting. There are so few instances in which \\"otherworldly\\" fantasy plays a role that it seems out of place, and not yet very related to the rest of the narrative.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a fun but challenging game for all ages. Runs great on my Droid X2. Would easily pay $0.99 for it. Get it while it's FREE!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is a perfect example of how to take a beautiful thing and debase it out of spite. Vader says \\"Noooooooo...\\" at the end of Return of the Jedi?  I say \\"Mehhhhhhhhh....\\" to this. I cancelled my preorder.

B0002KZAKS|4.0|I was so impressed with the Behringer B215D powered speaker and 1202FX mixer that I decided to give this $21. microphone a try. I mean, what did I have to lose! Right? In short, this microphone is a professional quality piece of equipment. It feels great, sounds great and also, seems to be designed to work perfectly with the aforementioned Behringer PA system. I highly recommend that you give this microphone a try. I know you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was. How do they do it at this price?
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Review the product for how it is advertised then.  It doesn't pretend to be a package containing extended versions or full of extras.  Just wanted the movies and this is what this is.  Excellent package, excellent cost.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I have been waiting to see this as the free app of the day! Super cute, very smooth. Graphics look great for this game running on the asus transformer tablet. Load times are not long for me. I love this game!
B005CW5E3E|5.0|I downloaded this album yesterday and was really pleasantly surprised. Being a huge Johnny Winter fan for 25 years or more I have enjoyed but have been disappointed with his last two albums. This album however is no disappointment. Although it lacks his fiery guitar runs of 20 years ago his great vocal growl is back and he sounds like he is having a great time. His guitar playing is still very good and really has that blues feel to it. Although these songs have been done so many times by other artists, Johnny puts his brand on these and make them his own. The guests appearing on this album are of high musical calibre. Johnny let's his guests express themselves throughout and the result is excellent. If you are a Johnny fan, this is a must have.
B0058VW36U|1.0|this game looks fun, but won't open on my Motorola Droid (v. 1). i get the load screen then it just jumps back to the Amazon app store... suggestions?
B0055S348W|2.0|This app is great if you only want to print pictures, but pdfs fail with an error code 11. checked the support site and found that there is no fix available. so great, i can print pictures of my cat but not the forms i need for tomorrows meeting. if the app cannot print business docs, then maybe it should not have a business price. price it like the toy it is.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very well done game. I gotta when it was the free app of the day, but it's easily worth a buck
B0051QO4QY|5.0|... This is the album of the decade (at least in my opinion). Sure, you can read this and think that I'm just another delusional Gaga fan but hear me out. The church bells in Marry The Night, the demonic voice is Bloody Mary, the wonderful use of actual instruments in the songs- This is such an innovative record that is sure to set the lead for many pop acts to follow. Really looking at it, listening to it, Gaga's lyrics have grown and still hold the special meanings inside them; the music is still revolutionary; the production is just fantastic. All in all I think this is an enjoyable pop record not just for Monsters, but also for the casual pop music fan.   Standout Tracks:   Marry The Night- The church bells added with the lyrics are legendary! This song is fantastic!  Scheiße- \\"If you're a strong female, you don't need permission\\". Words to live by along with a kickass chorus.  Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)- How many people could relase a song with the word Unicorn in the title and have it be amazing?  Heavy Metal Lover- The \\"Oooo ooo oo oooo oooo Heavy Metal Lover\\" chorus is phenomenal.  The Edge of Glory- One of my favorites from the first time I heard it. This is just a SMASH the first time you hear it.
B003JLA4KS|2.0|I was a Rush fan growing up, have seen them several times in concert during the \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\" era. So, my Rush credentials are in order.<br /><br />By any modern standard, this can hardly be called a documentary. It's clear that the members don't like any in-depth prodding, so what we end up with is really shallow. Here's what the DVD covers:<br /><br />1. Early years.<br />2. Critics never liked us.<br />3. Here's what each album was about.<br />4. A teeny bit of personal stuff.<br /><br />And, that's it. Instead of prodding Neil Peart and the others about their Ayn Rand fixation, we hear nothing of it. Ayn Rand was a bizarre person, with even more bizarre beliefs, and hated people she thought were a drain on other successful people. So why the intense appeal of this loony to three great musicians that seem like nice guys?<br /><br />Instead of asking Alex Lifeson about his brawl with police officers in 2003, we get to see the church basement they played at when they were sixteen.<br /><br />We don't even get to hear how \\"Gary\\" became \\"Geddy\\".<br /><br />The whole thing is really, really shallow. They don't even discuss the music in depth. Just that they tried to push themselves.<br /><br />Oh, and please stop putting Jack Black in all these documentaries on rock bands. The only thing worse than his bad acting is his bad documentary input. Please put a muzzle on that clown. One star off just for having him here.
B001FB55H6|5.0|the bluray is a good film, the support is very great.thanks a lot.the bluray is a good film, the support is very great.thanks a lot.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game its really fun. I took away a star because unfortunately for me it sometimes lags and completely locks up my phone to where i have to take out the battery. It also takes a little long to load.Not the games fault i think my phone is just a little old although it usually does pretty good so i am not sure. Great graphics and artwork imo. I like the different zombies and new equipment that keeps the game challenging and the strategy involved. The gameplay can get quite intense. Definitely worth the money for those with high end phones as for me i will just have to wait to play till my next upgrade. galaxy s froyo 2.2
B002KSPKRS|5.0|My husband and I are big gamers (lately call of duty black ops) and he's had his eye on turtle beach's for quite a while. Being an awesome wife i ordered them for him from amazon.com (and received them very promptly). he's had them for about three weeks now and LOVES them.  In that time his K.D.R. has gone up dramatically!! With the X41's you can hear the enemy sneaking up so clearly. You can hear people picking up amo or reloading from across the map..you can hear the pin from a grenade hit the floor from the next building. Plus, you can sync the game chat volume and the game play volume so you can still hear your team talking while grenades are bursting around you. It brings and entirely new level to gaming that you just cant experience without the high quality surround sound that the X41's bring to the table. Excellent product, once you play one game, your play will never be the same again.  My husband loves his Turtle Beach X41's and we HIGHLY reccomend them. Plus, I installed them for him and it was SUPER easy, very basic instalation process.. and im a blonde :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. Its cute and whimsical and there are always new props and things being added in the levels to make the gameplay more interesting. No problems running it so far its very smooth galaxy s. p.s. the little air bags making the poot noise is so funny.
B004V2S4SS|2.0|After enjoying this show for years I feel like the finally was extremely poor. It was like the show producers ran out of time or rushed to finish the show early packing as much events as they possibly can in one episode.<br /><br />Through the years we as viewers became part of their family and we deserve more settling finally. It's like I was kicked out of their family without even saying good bye to some of the family members. What happened to Bridgette for example?<br /><br />Over the past few years they kept saying your spirit will look like when you die even with the cloth you have on at the time of death. That wasn't the case for Allison. She was young and wearing normal cloth. I think the finally was a joke.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 6yr old son enjoys this game. very fun to play works great on my HTC touch phone! I'd recommend this game - very cute
B0058VW36U|5.0|This one is better than angry birds IMO.  great app to kill some time challenging the old noodle.  Slow to load on the Galaxy S but once loaded and in-game, flawless.  Thanks Amazon.  Easily a great buy at .99 cents if you dont score it today. Grab this one!
B0051CSI0G|4.0|If it's zombie vampires you're looking for, this movie is the way to go! It may not be totally action packed, but it has it's moments with some interesting characters. This movie is mainly about surivival when the world falls apart. Definitely worth a watch!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I believe Eliza and Mark are one of the greatest romances ever written, because of the honesty and truth of their story. I love Matthew Macfayden and think he was the best possible choice for Mr. Darcy.
0761119752|5.0|Pajama Time! has different pacing from Sandra Boynton's other books we own and read regularly ([[ASIN:0689835000 Opposites]] and [[ASIN:0671449028 The Going-To-Bed Book]] have been in regular rotation for our 2½ year old), so it initially threw me and my wife off.<br /><br />The book is best read in half rhyme, half song. As per usual, the rhymes are predictable and match what's illustrated on the page, so by the 3rd or 4th reading our son was able to begin filling in the blanks at the end of each stanza.<br /><br />It's very fun to read in tandem with another adult, where \\"It's Pajama Time!\\" is sung at the the end of most pages. Our toddler quickly joins in.<br /><br />If there's one detractor, unlike Ms. Boynton's other bedtime stories, this isn't the greatest wind-down book, as the singing keys our son up just a bit as we're settling down for bed.  We've found it best to put this one on the top of the pile, and finish up with a lower key book to tone things down before lights out.
B005974CNA|5.0|I still remember when Mr. Portnoy dropped the bomb last year, I was shocked and worried that DT would call it quits! Thank goodness they didn't, because it would've been crazy after releasing the amazing 'Black Clouds...' album!!!     Exit Portnoy. Enter Mangini. 'A dramatic Turn of Events' is released. I didn't know what to expect. I was just expecting it to come close to their last. Then I listen to it for the first time, realizing this is a special album!!! It's one of those albums that gets better with every listen, and I've probably listened to it about twenty-five times and I still can't stop listening to it!!! This album definitely deserves a song-by-song review so here it is:    \\"On The Backs of Angels\\"- It starts with some lovely sounding acoustic arpeggios, before erupting into a nice, aggressive riff. Mangini has a nice ride section on the bridge. I love Jordan's classical piano interlude in the middle. The chorus is fairly catchy as well.    \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\"-Cool intro, a little electronica beat over a pounding riff!!! The chorus is addicting, as is the part directly after!!! The atmosphere created on the 2nd verse is very compelling. It has a cool little breakdown section in there as well. James LaBrie really shines on this record, particularly this song. I wasn't a big fan of the way they've mix his voice since the 'Turbulence' album, but I heard his latest solo album and he sounds great, so this tells me the main problem is in the effects and mixing of his voice. Not here though!!! He sounds great!!!    \\"Lost, Not Forgotten\\"- Again, Rudess delivers with an awesome piano part, before the band joins him for a majestic reprise. Then complete chaos breaks loose, with a killer riff followed by the crazy parts DT is known for. It kind of reminds me of 'Images...' John Myung lays down some rapid-finger basswork and some cool bass fills. I love the nice, dreamy aura  present in the second verse. This song also showcases a phenomenal instrumentalsection, which again recalls 'Images...', as well as one of Petrucci's finest solos.    \\"This Is The Life\\"- A nice change of pace. One of the slower songs on the album. Not my favorite, but it's growing on me and getting better with each listen.     \\"Bridges In The Sky\\"-Interesting intro. Some cool choral sounds. Then it breaks into mayhem. This is probably the heaviest song on the album. Petrucci proves he's a riff monster with some thrashy, complex guitar parts he's known for. In general, the choruses on this album seem more concentrated and catchy than on previous albums, and this is possibly the best of them all!!! Very catchy!!! The thing I love about this song is it keeps building and building, all the way to the climatic ending!!! The instrumental section conjours up memories of \\"Home\\" and 'Scenes...'in general. Awesome track!!!    \\"Outcry\\"-The thing I love about this album is the foreplay between heaviness and atmosphere!!! It works very well and keeps things from getting stale. No track exemplifies this better than \\"Outcry\\". there's a nice rapid-fire staccato-burst guitar riff, followed by another 'Scenes...'-sounding instrumental section. Here, Rudess and Petrucci shine better than ever!!! Chromatic runs and insane arpeggios dominate. A mellow, jazzy little section preludes the chorus. Neat little Steve Morse-Dregs sounding part at the end.    \\"Far From Heaven\\"-Basically, the \\"Vacant\\" of this album. It's okay, I guess. A Labrie-Rudess performance.    \\"Breaking All Illusions\\"-In a word, breathtaking. Possibly the best track on the album, DT shows why they're the best. This song is chock-full of 70's prog interplay, echoing tribute to the past's prog icons such as Yes, ELP, Genesis, Kansas, Dixie Dregs, etc... This track sometimes reminds me of \\"Learning to Live\\". It has a very strong contemporary feel to it as well. Excellent track!!!    \\"Beneath The Surface\\"- an uplifting, subtle ballad closes the album. It sort of reminds me of \\"A Drop In The Ocean\\" by Stratovarius. Nice acoustic parts and lush string arrangements. Rudess has a cool moog-sounding part reminiscient of Keith Emerson. A proper ending to a phenomenal album!!!    Next to 'Images And Words', this is my favorite Dream Theater album. It's solid from start to finish and retains more of their prog roots while still maintaining a metallic edge. They give the songs plenty of breathing space with their thoughtful arrangements.    The only thing I don't like is Andy Wallace's mix. It doesn't seem to punch as much. I understand wanting a big name like him, but he's obviously not used to mixing progressive metal bands.    The DVD is a nice inclusion but I can't watch it too much, or I get depressed thinking about \\"what if\\" Dream Theater went with Marco Minneman, as I liked his performance the best!!! I understand why they went with Mangini but I think Minneman is better!!!    Anyway, this is a complete masterpiece!!! A must-have!!!
0553801473|5.0|Started reading this series a couple weeks after the HBO series started and read it all the way through this current installment. For the life of me I don't understand how a person can be a fan of the series and give this book a poor review. I agree that A Feast for Crows was slower paced, but I thought the same thing about large portions of A Clash of Kings. I found that the pace of this book mirrors the pace of the first and third books in the series. Furthermore, it perfectly sets up The Winds of Winter, which will have two epic battles early in the book. So all the cranks that wanted the series to be over in three installments need to just chill and be patient. This book advances the plot to exactly the point it needs to in order to appropriately tell the story. Once again, all the negative reviews sound like a bunch of people upset that the story hasn't gone as they expected (I actually enjoy being surprised, but whatever) or that Martin couldn't tell it in three volumes.

B005CGI4EG|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2NHDLTFUMHAP8]]This is a video review of the Married With Children Series Box set released in September 2011.  This review does not cover the show itself, this is a video review talking about the packaging for the most part.  This review shows the box being opened and what's inside.<br /><br />I rated the box 4 out of 5 due to the bizarre packaging.  However, if it had more normal packaging it would be a five star review due to the show being pretty darned funny, as well as being an EXTREMELY great value.<br /><br />UPDATE Dec 2011: It appears that sometime in the month of December, Amazon has taken the reviews for both the Sep 2011 release and the Dec 2010 release of Married with Children and merged them together.  This is particularly irritating, as my video review now shows up on the Dec 2010 version, and it has nothing to do with that release.  Please keep in mind this review is specifically for the Sep 2011 version, and NOT the other one.  The review is about the packaging, and given they're RADICALLY different between the two releases, it's annoying that Amazon has merged the two sets of reviews.  Please be sure you're looking at the right one when watching this video.  The two releases are:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005CGI4EG Married...With Children: The Complete Series]] - Sep 27, 2011 Release (the one the video is for)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00432QAKK Married...with Children: The Complete Series]] - Dec 12, 2010 Release (the one the video is NOT for).<br /><br />A final reminder, the discs themselves are the same, and the content on the discs is the same for the two sets.  The only difference is the packaging, which is quite radically different. Check my video for that.  Tkx.<br /><br />UPDATE DEC 2014: It appears this $40 set is out of print, and they're releasing the individual seasons all over again.  Shame, as this was a great value.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Literally hours of entertainment. Top notch graphics and sound, plays perfectly on my Fascinate. Difficult too, some levels make you really think hard on strategy! Desparately needs a pause button tho so you can around the map.  $3 is a steal.
B005KXTER2|4.0|As a long time fan of Steve Hackett, it seems to me that he is really expanding his talent as a guitarist and a song writer.  This album has some wonderful moments, with some thundering rock tunes like Loch Lomond, and sweet acoustic numbers like Summers Breath.  There is something here for just about every Hackett fan, as the breadth and reach of this album, which has been apparently issued with little fanfare (at least here in the states) is quite ambitious.  Steve seems to be approaching this point of his life and musical career with passion and creativity - well done!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Music has always been a comfort for me amidst the craziness of life. Own the Night was released during a week that brought painful heartbreak into my life. Since then, this album has been there for me to cry with and laugh with. I don't know many albums that can do that all at once. Relationships are a funny thing sometimes. The outcome can never be predicted, and the risk many times is so high. Many times hearts are opened and never fully appreciated by the other person. The songs on this album are heart warming and heart breaking at the same time, in a way only someone who has ever lost a love or a hope for love. During a break up, the inner struggle lies with letting go and freeing yourself from a comfortable place with someone special, and with remainder of all the amazing memories you spent together. All the memories like \\"When we Owned the Night\\" or the time he \\"Danced Away with my Heart\\". \\"It was perfect and I held it in my mind\\"...But those beautiful memories with someone running through your mind are usually what hurts the most. Those moments in life when you realize that \\"you wanted someone so bad that it hurt\\" and turns out that you just wanted them more. The breathless feeling, as you watch them turn away, you wish there was any possible way to change their mind. Or the painful desire that for just once you could feel \\"Cold as Stone\\", and the ache in your heart would stop for just a second. The raw emotions in the vocals of Lady Antebellum make it easier to know that somewhere other people are feeling the same way, and true love doesn't come easy for everyone. But despite the heartbreak, Lady Antebellum gives a listener hope that one day you can find love again with \\"Just a Kiss Goodnight\\". They bring hopefulness to find someone that will make you their very own \\"Friday Night\\". Despite all the heart aches and the painfulness of losing love \\"breathe in, breathe out\\" because \\"Somewhere Love Remains\\".

B0058VW36U|5.0|I was going to hold out and wait for it to be the free app of the day,  but I paid for it. I think it's two dollars on the Android marketplace, so it's a good deal on Amazon. It's a lot of fun, but I still like Angry Birds and Death Worm better. It's a no brainer for free or 99 cents.
B0058VW36U|5.0|super fluid animation, clever puzzles. i picked thus game up for free thorough the Amazon app store but is definitely worth a dollar. super well designed from the puzzles to the loading screens.
0316134082|2.0|There is absolutely nothing special about this so called Breaking Dawn Collector's Edition.  Yeah it comes in a slip case and has a cloth over and a red ribbon.......whoo hooo big deal.  I thought there was suppose to be more details to the title page but nothing to brag about.  Don't waste your money!

B0057GYOA4|5.0|I was skeptical about this release and how it would sound and my fears are laid to rest.  It sounds amazing!  An already-amazing album just got even better.  I got the 2 disc version because I don't need the 4 disc set although would be nice but this got most of the songs so I am happy.  I am also happy it contains alot of hard to find B-Sides and it finally has Something in the Way and Endless Nameless tied together in one song like it was meant to be.  It also contains my favorite B-Side Sappy.  You will definitely hear a difference in sound quality on this album from the 1991 version you will notice that Daves drums are louder and more crisp than ever (which is a good thing) as well as Kurt's guitar.  The bass also sounds great.  So if your a Nirvana fan pick up the 2 disc version you won't be sorry.  All I can say is bring on the 20th Anniversary Edition of In Utero.  :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|One of the best puzzle games around. For 99 cents, it's a steal, but for yhe Free App of the Day, there's no reason NOT to get this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was told about this book by a friend and so I thought I'd read it.  It was engaging from the start.  I enjoyed the story line.  The development of characters really draws you in and you love and loath each of them as if you were there yourself.  I ended up getting the rest of the trilogy because I had to know how it ended!  Entertaining read.

0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the story line of this series up until the last part of this book.  I was left a bit disappointed and cold after finishing this book.  It really felt like the end was just rushed to wrap it up.  The twist in the execution was left to assume why but not really explained.  Katniss and her state of mind were left weak, and while it may be intentional, it seemed half hearted.  The final chapter and epilogue just left it as a last resort and not a desired result.  So, I am left a little disappointed with this trilogy that I was so riveted to at the beginning.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|i own all the desperate housewives seasons. i perfer to watch the whole season at once instead of every week. i even turned my husband into a lover of the show.
0439023491|4.0|I eagerly started this book after reading The Hunger Games.  The beginning was a bit slow as the events that happened after the first book ended and the second began were somewhat summarized.  I found my mind would wander a bit because it wasn't as engaging as the first.  It was more interesting in the second part as some things kept you guessing and when it finished it left you hanging and wanting more.  Overall, I did find it entertaining and I had to get the last book!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|On Monday September 28, 2011, I and my son were invited to an advance screening of the new DreamWorks Pictures' movie Real Steel that was shown at the Uptown Palladium in Birmingham. MI. It turned to be one exciting film that we both enjoyed from beginning to end.<br /><br />Real Steel takes place in the year 2020 where boxing is now done  by robots that fight to the death.  Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a washed up former fighter turned robot boxing promoter that has been down on his luck for a good while.  Charlie has been trying to hit it big in robot boxing, but ends up owing large sums of money to some very dangerous people.<br /><br />One day he finds out that his former girlfriend has died, leaving him as the official guardian to his 11 year old son Max (played by Dakoto Goyo), who Charlie has not seen since since Max was a baby.  Max's aunt (played by Hope Davis) wants Charlie to give up custody of Max to her and her very rich husband.  And Charlie sees this situation as a way to get quick cash to buy another fighting robot so that he can get out of debt.<br /><br />But what Charlie does not count on is the fact that his son Max is one tough kid that shows him how to have the heart to try to win again against the odds.  And Max teaches Charlie that when you do what you love, the money will come.<br /><br />Real Steel is an exciting and endearing film.  Even though we all knew how the story would end, we could not help cheering for Charlie as he discovers how to finally be a dad and how to finally be a winner. And Dakoto Goyo who played Max is one awesome kid actor who made everyone in the audience fall in love with him.  My son likes his movies exciting and the fight scenes in Real Steel are in your face loud and graphic.  It was like watching a giant robot boxing video game on the movie screen.<br /><br />The most exciting part of the movie for me were the scenes that were filmed right here in Detroit.  Yep, this movie contains footage and aerial shots of downtown Detroit, including Cobo Hall and the GM Renaissance Center.  I was bursting with Detroit pride when I saw my city on the big screen.<br /><br />Just a warning to parents that this film is rated PG-13 because of the graphic boxing violence and because it contains quite a bit of adult language.<br /><br />If you like a real good underdog story that is funny, captivating and heartfelt, Real Steel delivers on all counts and will open in theaters nationwide of Friday, October 7th, 2011.e GM Renaissance Center.  I was bursting with Detroit pride when I saw my city on the big screen.

B0034G4P80|4.0|This movie was enjoyable and even though there are those detractors out there, I had fun with it. If you haven't seen it, just remember that this is a norse god that was brought into a comic book universe and now is being translated to screen. I thought they did a good job with it, given the subject matter. Being a fan of the Avengers, I was really worried when I heard that they were going to do a Thor centered movie. There are just too many ways for it to go terribly wrong.   In the end, it was a fun diversion and I don't think that anything was horribly flubbed. Not the best movie of the summer, or even the best super hero movie of the summer - fun nonetheless.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was a fun and explosive film.  The storyline was good and the characters are likeable.  The ending could have been better but overall a good movie.
B005974CNA|5.0|This disc is perfect, each song has personality. The product was as seller description. And shipping was very fast. I believe that Dream Theater did a great work on this disc. I'm very happy with the disc.
B003UESJH4|5.0|My husband and I just finished this movie and we both were impressed.  This is a brilliant movie. Based on a true story about the Prince who never expected to be King. The Duke of York  has a stammer, and hes tried many speech therapists, but all have failed. His wife never gave up on him though.  I think the cast did a great job especially Colin Firth.  I am a huge Colin fan and his performance blew me away. I even like the music in the end.
B0031R5K8G|4.0|What I most liked about this book was that it was told from such a unique perspective. The narrator of the story is a teen-aged autistic boy Christopher, who is out to discover who killed his neighbour's dog but in the process uncovers a mystery within his own family.  His perspective on life is innocent. Without the filtering systems within his mind to  block out unwanted sensory information and filter it to determine what is and is not important, Christopher sees the world literally and takes people at their word. It is a reminder of how silly some of the sayings of everyday life are when you take their meaning by the exact wording.

0393338827|4.0|Of all the business books I've read on the financial crises (Too Big to Fail, Meltdown, The Ascent of Money, and No One Would Listen), this book is the best at explaining what exactly had happened. It does so by chronicling the stories of individual investors (Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, and the founders of Cornwall Capital) who were using their time and commonsense to analyze the bonds issued by pooling together mortgages-subprime loans.  These simple investors and money managers saw that the fundamentals of the subprime mortgages (loans made people with low or no income) were flawed and unsustainable. Loans were being granted to people with low credit scores without any down-payment and with the first payment occurring after two years. To profit from this market irrationality, these investors decided to take a position against these loans and bet that there will be a substantial increase in default rates in 2007 for loans that were granted in 2005. In 2007, payments for loans granted in 2005 will become due after the grace period of 2 years ended.  They were able to bet against these loans by buying insurance on them. These insurance were technically called credit default swaps and were bought and sold over the counter actively in that time. Big Wall Street banks and other companies sold these insurance products at such low prices relative to the risks, which  allowed for our investors to purchase a huge number of them. Their prediction finally did materialize in 2007 and  in 2008 the entire world economy collapsed. All this happened because the big Wall Street banks were unaware of the risks involved in these mortgages. Especially, since S&P and Moody's rated them highly even though they had high default probability.  The beauty of the book lies in the stories of these individuals who went against the conventional wisdom of the market during that time. They realized that things were illogical and counterintuitive to whomever actually read the details. They saw the collapse coming in slow motion and the potential damage growing over time. Since no one would listen to them, they took it upon themselves to profit from it, and profit they did. All of them became multimillionaires in the end, and those who did not listen lost substantially. You walk away from the book convinced that the financial world is corrupt and not as sophisticated as it seems. A lot of the \\"best\\" investors on Wall Street have no clue about what is actually happening.  The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because although it had an excellent story and narrative, it was hard at first to follow the characters and understand the technicalities of the structured product used.
0312576463|4.0|I've always thought that good writing makes a book better but not necessarily good.  In this case, however, I didn't find the story or the characters particularly compelling, but I kept reading to see what other tricks of the written word Franzen had up his sleeve.  The first chapter hooked me completely, and, after that, there were just enough LOL moments to make it worthwhile.  Patty and Walter Bergland live in a gentrified neighborhood in St. Paul with their perfect daughter, Jessica, and perfect son, Joey--both teenagers.  Well, Joey is perfect up until the moment he decides to move in with his girlfriend, Connie, who lives with her mom and her mom's boyfriend.  This event rocks Patty's world, and then we read her therapeutic autobiography, which, I might add, eventually falls into the wrong hands.  Patty, a former college basketball star, is self-indulgent and depressed, not to mention unfaithful to her saint of a husband.  She's always had a thing for Richard, Walter's former roommate, but it was difficult for me to see what either man found attractive in her.  Some sections of the book I found to be just too wearing, particularly the coverage of Patty's relationship with the self-destructive Eliza.  Walter's life was infinitely more interesting, as he becomes involved with a coal mining operation in order to reclaim the land eventually for a bird sanctuary--or something like that.  His favorite cause, though, is zero population growth, and Walter fires shots at the Pope, even while contemplating making a baby with his young assistant, Lalitha.  In one particularly amusing scene, Walter, Lalitha, and Jessica are brainstorming to come up with a name for their ZPG group, and Franzen's list of options is a scream.  My favorite is \\"All Children Left Behind.\\"  Franzen makes the point that people love America for either money or freedom, and anyone who doesn't have money is more likely to relish various personal freedoms, even if they're harmful to the planet.
B0053F042G|3.0|If you watch a lot of mind-bending, sci-fi movies, you have probably thought about seeing this movie. However, if you are this type of person, you will see through the plot within the first couple of minutes and hope something surprising happens. It doesn't. The plot feels quickly thrown together, hardly thought out, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who I think can be a great actor, is boring in this movie. I loved him in Love and Other Drugs and thought he was good in Brothers, but he's a very static character here. The movie could have been great, but it fell incredibly short. Watch it if you have some time to kill, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it.

It has been very difficult at times to wait for so long but i was determined to hold out from getting it until the full version became free. There were a few times where I almost caved in and bought it, but through self discipline i was able to hold back, which has gotten me get to this day. Definitly 5 STARS and well worth the wait!!!

0553801473|1.0|Well, after six long years of waiting, we were finally treated to the book that author George R. R. Martin promised would be released only a year after that other colossal mess in the series, A Feast For Crows. Yes, most people know the story by now, Martin had to split A Feast For Crows into two books because he wrote too much, and promised that the next book would only be a year away after forcing readers to wait five years since the latest release in the series, A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />A Feast For Crows was routinely criticized for the delay in publication, the expansion of the storyline, the plodding pace and lack of resolution. It seemed as if Martin has lost his way. In A Dance With Dragons, Martin tells the story of the major characters missing from the previous volume (mainly Jon Snow, Danaerys, and Tyrion Lannister) in a parallel time frame. It took eleven long years to finally hear from these characters again. Again, the same faults there were present in AFFC are also present here in ADWD. The story moves at a slow and plodding pace, with no hint of a conclusion being presented. The major characters do not do much of anything, nor is there much offered in the way of development. A major revelation is made early in the book which has the potential to change the course of the story, but it came straight out of left-field with absolutely no foreshadowing provided. It is not until towards the end of the book that you start seeing some conflict arise, but just when the book starts to become interesting a worth of more than a one-star review, the author abruptly cuts the story off and leaves us with cliffhangers that will more than likely not be answered until the next volume is released probably some six, seven, or maybe even eight years from now.<br /><br />With all that being said there maybe hope yet. The nightmarish mistake of splitting AFFC into two parallel volumes is finally over. The next books in the series are supposed to be stand-alone volumes,and the hope is that we will see some push towards the climax and final conclusion of the series. After all, there are supposed to be only two more volumes left. Martin's first three books of the A Song of Fire and Ice series were excellent works which told an intriguing story and moved the plot forward. The past two volumes have been disappointments in unnecessary expansion which has muddied the storyline quite a bit. I do have faith that the final two books will finally move the story towards its ultimate conclusion. Hopefully, the worst is truly over.

For starters, it was almost impossible to put it down--after a few pages, I was completely hooked. The characters were so real, the descriptions so vivid and the situations so compelling and dynamic, I almost wanted to stay up all night to finish it. The dramatic plot is brutal yet thrilling and just takes the fantasy genre to a new, gritty level. The thought of a post-apocalyptic world that leads to survivalist competitions is like a foray into a Darwin nightmare. Suzanne Collins made the concept believable and relatable, which is an amazing feat for an author.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Loved this movie. Even if you have woes about the plot, the action and training of the actresses is amazing. Huge FYI, the extended version of the movie helps a lot and is actually a far better ending.
0345529057|5.0|The books I ordered showed up exactly on time as I was told they would.  The books were a boxed set in perfect condition.  I am stll reading the set and they are well written as well as entirely engrossing.  They give a picture of earlier times with a realism that mixed well with fantasy elements making them very believable as fantasy
B0036OS3PQ|5.0|A few days ago I received his Crocs boots and I am satisfied. They are easy, comfortable and looks good. On the wearing properties will be able to say, the start of the season, but I think the problem will not happen. Purchase of $ 27 and it was a good price! The size is correct!
1463514581|5.0|I just loved this story and truthfully I was surprised that I liked it so much.  I thought the story had potential, and I like plenty of books about vampires, witches, etc, but a pshychic?  I was skeptical.  But from the first page in I was hooked.  I loved the story and the characters.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I have an android tablet, and a MyTouch 3g. My 3g doesn't want to run the game, it just crashes, and the tablet cannot download it. Whenever I try on the tablet, I get the error that I have to connect to wifi to download it, DESPITE ALREADY BEING CONNECTED TO WIFI. My tablet does not have any sort of network connection besides wifi, (no 3g or 4g), and in order to access anything on the app store, I have to connect to wifi. So to sum it up, I have to connect to wifi to attempt to download, and then when attempting to download I have to be told to connect to wifi. Ugh.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I get this game when came out here on Amazon it's funny smooth and challenging. I don't know why people rate this with one star.just because their phones won't open PR crash doesn't meant the game sucks.don't blame the game game by itself it's awesome. blame your phone! !! owner of LG g2x
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Star Wars Episode 4 in the 2004 DVD had the music volume turned down as the X wings descended down the trench. In this 2011 release, they say the music volume is now up again? The change was definitely deliberate. Why must these changes be back and forth? That is a sign of uncertainty or some marketing scheme.  Is there anyone who actually likes the added \\"No\\" and \\"Noooo!\\" by vador in Return of the Jedi? I watched it on Youtube and was hurt. The change actually sinks the impact of the movie. It takes you 'out' of the movie instead of pulling you in it. At the end we still see the new younger Anakin instead of the older person that Luke saw. But if I was Luke, I would be thinking to myself 'Who is that guy?'  I jumped on-board the 'Widescreen' or 'Letterbox' format many years ago, when everyone was against it, because you could see a film the way the film looked in the theater. But with Star Wars, that is no longer possible. I didnt mind the Special Editions and some of the added things but what seems to be going on here is an unfair bait-switching to earn money for future releases.  These additions are distractions. Sometimes traditions should be left alone. There are a lot of angry people. I understand it. You dont mess with a person's tradition.  It seems that Lucas tried and tried to merge the original trilogy with the newer trilogy together, and you simply cant do it.   When Black and White movies were colorized at least you could turn down the color on the TV if you didnt like it. With this, we will boycott it. NO I DIDNT EVEN BUY IT!! That'll teach them a lesson. Lucas can do what he wants, and I hope the majority does what they want by not buying. It would be neat if this gives him an economic crash.
B003YV64OI|5.0|Ordered from \\"better choice\\" 3rd party seller here... this is important to know because I unlocked this chip with a cheap AM3 Asus motherboard --- and turned it into a PHENOM QUAD-CORE X4 B50. It ran fine unlocked in Prime95 for a half day so I now have a much better chip than what I paid for :)  So if you want to get a (potentially) unlockable chip, I recommend getting it from the supply at the store I mentioned above.   Great deal for a budget gamer computer build.... especially if it unlocks with a decent motherboard.   I was also able to overclock it past 3.4GHZ, but I felt it was not needed with the games, yet.  The only con: is I was wishing for unlocking the L3 cache, but no luck. I did turn this into a AMD Phenom X4 B50 though, which I can't complain about!  This, along with a decent GTX460 and a measly 2GB ram can run Crysis at FULL HIGH settings after testing  A+ Value \\"bang for buck\\" in my opinion ... my setup did not even cost $500 total, and it is he-ll of a machine for the price I paid for everything.

1442344989|5.0|Jaycee Dugard was eleven when she was kidnapped from her home and mother and step father, For the next eighteen years, she lived as a prisoner in a personal hell. For eighteen years, she was an object for sexual and mental abuse from her captures.<br /><br />This biography is so powerful and upseting at the same time. This audio project drove me to tears. I wanted to reach thru my CD player and wished I could comfort her.<br /><br />Her biography inspires by showing she is a survivor. It is the way she remembered it and shows. You will be moved as I was.<br /><br />Dugard still has the child-like voice in her narration. However there could be no one better to narrate her biography that her. I cannot say she is the best narrator I have ever heard. However,  to reveal her story, no other actress could have done it any better.<br /><br />This is an emotional scary audio  piece that will tear at your soul. I do not use these words lightly.<br /><br />You cannot believe this really happened, but it did..and for eighteen years. This audio must be heard, it must never be forgotten<br /><br />Once you listen to this seven and a half  hour audio Presentation, you will understand my passion of why this is a production that is so important to listen to<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz<br />AUDIOWORLD
B005FUTBWS|5.0|This movie is somewhat a resemblance of the Waco siege, except Kevin adds a \\"Patriot Act\\" twist to it, you know, where every citizen is a terrorist.  It's like looking into the future.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I would always play this on my friend's iPhone and this is just as good, if not better. Is three seconds of loading time too long for some people? Oh wah. Get a better phone or just get over it. HTC Inspire.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was 9 years old (nom I'm 42).  As the years go by I've seen George Lucas make changes and adjustments to the original trilogy.  Not all this changes are good but in the end this is the world HE CREATED and he has the right to do with it what he wants.  How much I wished that the original versions of A New Hope, Empire and Jedi were included in this set but Lucas doesn't want us to see those versions.  Let's face it, it is highly unlikely that we will see the old versions in HD someday soon, maybe after Lucas is dead we'll get them.  So, for now we have to accept what Lucasfilm is giving to us.<br />The movies have never seen better, the image quality is great, the sound has improved a lot and we even have back the music of the moment the X-Wing Fighters start the attack on the  Death Star in A New Hope, that music cue has been restored only in the English soundtrack.  The extras are great, the deleted scenes are like a treasure and SURPRISE SURPRISE, the cartoon from the Star Wars Holiday Special is included, this is the cartoon that features the first appearance of a little character called Bobba Fett.  You just have to look for it, it is easy to find it.<br />So I think that even if I don't like some of the latest changes, I still like Star Wars, we just have to accept that if it was our movie and we had the money and time, we too would be making a lot of changes to \\"make it better\\".<br />Just imagine what changes are coming to the 3D versions of the movies...
0765365278|5.0|This book is enchanting, paced, exciting and written wonderfully. I am impartial to reading, I have to really love something to be interested past the first 100 pages. Brandon Sanderson is amazing, gifted and extremely talented. My brother and I both talk about his books for hours, we're extremely impressed with what he has done with the Wheel of Time (originally by R Jordan) and his personal series have an intense amount of devotion and detail dedicated to their success.<br /><br />I seriously wonder if this man every gets any sleep. He puts these books out at a remarkable pace.<br /><br />Support this author, you will surely be impressed.

B005OIAFQC|3.0|OK, to first address the thesis-length negative review: it is true that VNV hasn't really changed much stylistically since they released Matter + Form. But a pretentious review with overly elaborate metaphors that makes fun of the band members' being fat is ridiculous.  I didn't like everything about this release. While the vocals are good, and Ronan sounds like a much more positive and optimistic man than on previous releases, the music itself seems to be an afterthought. After listening to it straight through, I don't think I could have told one beat apart from another if there weren't any lyrics, with a few exceptions. I think I was disappointed in this album because Ronan claimed that it \\"may be one of their best\\".    The final word: if you have been a VNV fan for awhile, like myself, you might as well get this album. It's a good listen. If you're a first-time VNV listener, Judgement or Of Faith, Power and Glory will work just as well.
0783231202|5.0|This movie, though horrifically graphic about the inhumanity of both slave traders and African slavers, is a must see for everyone. The complete and utter disconnect in the communication barrier between the enslaved and the abolitionist alone is a heart wrenching story within a story. How could it be that a country founded in freedom and liberty would practice this disgrace for hundreds of years without conscience? It is of interesting note that evovled 20th Century racism was not a driving force during the first couple of hundred years of American slavery and the salve trade. The preferred justification was that the Africans were not human beings but were animals and hence were chattel. The movie begs the question that continues to haunt the world today, \\"What is it that divides humankind most often?\\"

0307272702|4.0|Why We Get Fat, smoothly written by science writer Gary Taubes, organizes the facts clearly and comes to a convincing conclusion.  But even though it didn't wander, the book took forever getting to the point.  As I reread it to write this review, I'm surprised at how much faster it flows and how much more accessible the material seems.  Leaving out the one page executive summary may have been a good marketing tactic, but it hurt the book's effectiveness.  Once Taubes got to the point - that overweight inactive bodies make us eat, rather than the reverse -- he stayed with it and amplified his conclusion effectively.  This may have been necessary.  I wanted a wise \\"some people think this, some people think that\\" position, until confronted with an outrageous factoid.  Rats bred to be fat will stay fat, even when starved and exercised until they lose so much heart muscle mass that they die.  That's heresy! Weight reflects something other than eating more calories than you burn?  I didn't want to believe it, because I had carefully eaten many more vegetables for the last year.  This eliminated nearly all the weight I gained in the decades since I graduated from college.    But he's probably right.  It's not the vegetables I did eat, it's the sugar and flour and potatoes they displaced.  Because I've noticed that I can eat 3000 calories of peanuts and pistachios and hamburgers in a day now and they just don't stick. Now just because there's no instant effect doesn't make me think this safe for the long term.  But you won't convince me the body simply inventories the calories that flow through.  Taubes adds more science about sizes of bad LDL cholesterol molecules, and rejects the idea these fats are all bad for your blood pressure.    Taubes points out he can't guarantee he's right about what DOES cause weight gain.  But long ago doctors knew the problem with carbohydrates and weight gain, and left this path in the 1960s.  Influential Dr. Jean Mayer wrote the US Public Health Service report on weight loss and exercise.  \\"If exercise is decreased below a certain point, food intake no longer decreases.\\"  Mayer knew that appetite increased with exercise, but created a loophole we have all come to believe as truth.  So... Some people want to believe thermodynamics tells us weight is a function of calories consumed minus exercise produced, and some people think biology means you retain weight as a function of hormonal and genetic influences.  Taubes gives great credibility to the second viewpoint.  Read this book, then skim it again quickly because you'll retain the facts better once you understand Taubes' point.  5 stars - Will reflect well on you if given as a gift   ==> 4 stars - Worth reading to enrich your life   3 stars - Entertainment for those with time on their hands   2 stars - Fun to read, but not the best use of time   1 star - So poorly written I felt like I wasted my time
B005HPA2XI|4.0|This is the most straightforward output by Mastodon to date. Brann sings a couple of songs and Brent's irritating vocals come through on a couple as well. Alot of these songs remind me of \\"aqua Dementia\\". Still goin with the whole pscychedelic vibe of metal and even go as far as to quote some Paul McCartney lyrics (The love you make is equal to the love you take) so it goes from head bangin to head scratchin. Maybe it's a coincidence but once bands get on a major label (as Mastodon did with Warner) they seem to always slow things down a bit too much. Definitely some rockers on here but some Queens of the Stone Age - tempo styled stuff on here as well.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I have been in love with Ryan Reynolds since I saw him and his abs in the remake of \\"The Amityville Horror\\". I came across this film a few weeks ago on cable TV and immediately went out and bought the Blu-ray disc. The movie deals with a young truck driver working in Iraq who wakes up to find himself buried alive in a wooden coffin. The only thing that keeps him alive is a cell phone and a lighter and it's up to him to try to get out of this terrible hell he has found himself in.<br /><br /> What makes \\"Buried\\" so good is how suspenseful it is. The viewer asks the question, \\"Will this guy get out or will he die here?\\". For the entire 90 minutes of this movie you will be on the edge of your seat biting your nails hoping against hope this man is saved.<br /><br /> Ryan Reynolds is also the only person to appear on film during its duration. There are voice actors used when his character is talking to them via his cell, but Reynolds carries the movie and I might add superbly.<br /><br /> \\"Buried\\" was made in Spain which explains why I didn't hear about the movie until recently. It has had many showings at independent film festivals around the world, but has never seen a major U.S. release.<br /><br /> The Blu-ray comes with a wonderful featurette entitled, \\"Unearthing Buried: The Making of Buried\\".
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|Fairly decent album, one wonders why she or handlers felt the need to place her nude on the album cover? Do you suppose she will be taken as a serious musician by her peers or fans after this?
0670034711|4.0|I read this book when it first came out, or let's say that I read most of it. I became impatient in parts and skipped over things. Then recently I read many of the reviews and wanted to read it again and this time I read every word.   Where do I begin? Perhaps Gilbert's bathroom floor would be a good place to start. When we find her lying there crying every night over a marriage which is past its shelf life and a family she doesn't want to start, I could relate. I had a good marriage and I did take the risk and had one baby but just one! I think that many women can relate to her doubts about whether she was the earth mother type.  Her itch to travel ends up in a year-long therapeutic adventure. Now mind you this isn't Fodor's Guide to Italy, India, and Bali. She admits that during her four months in Italy she never entered a museum as the restaurants were the goal here--Italy was the place she'd chosen to regain her physical strength. She gained 23 pounds eating pasta, pizza, and gelato, and I assume that all the walking she did kept her from getting overly plump--as she was told a few times over the course of her trip, she was still \\"cute.\\"   Although she didn't provide the detailed travelogue many would have liked, I enjoyed hearing her tales of the beautiful, the ugly, and the odd. I discovered that Italy which conjures up visions of amazing art and architecture still has its share of eccentricity--she claims that Naples is dominated by laundry hanging out to dry (and I'm thinking that maybe I saw enough laundry in Manila!).   Once she is into the praying phase of her trip, she does an excellent job of describing the ashrams and the pious souls who spend their days chanting and meditating. She soon becomes quite an expert in both chanting and meditation. And this is where I beg to differ with all of the critics who labeled her trek as \\"self-indulgent.\\" I don't believe that sitting for 90 minutes meditating while the mosquitoes eat you alive or forcing yourself tomake it through a particularly grueling chant (in Gilbert's opinion anyway) can in any way be called \\"self-indulgent\\" or \\"self-absorbed.\\" People who do this sort of thing aren't just contemplating their navels; they're seeking the divine. Granted, the divine can be found without going to an ashram in India, but this was the path Gilbert chose. Also, the spiritual path Gilbert chose involved maintenance of the ashrams. She spent five hours a day while there scrubbing floors--hardly the life of a narcissist.   In Bali Gilbert sought \\"balance\\"--a marriage between pleasure and devotion. She received both and later on found the love that led to her marriage with the Brazilian Felipe. I found it remarkable that Gilbert showed such patience and wisdom in her dealings with third-world people who would try the patience of Gandhi. I wanted to scream at the woman who was holding onto the $18,000 Gilbert had raised to go towards a home for her and her family. Gilbert suffered somewhat from the encounter but never gave up on the woman who was finally coerced into buying a home, saving Gilbert from humiliation. I wanted to tell Gilbert, \\"My child made me want to pull out my hair sometimes, but I wouldn't have traded her for life with some of these child-like people.\\" I'm thinking of her medicine man who seemed to have a touch of the memory problems we often experience as we grow older and as Gilbert said, \\"He could have been anywhere between 65 and 105.\\" He exasperated her when he met Felipe and told Gilbert that he was a \\"good man,\\" only to tell her after she had commenced her affair with the Brazilian that he remembered saying no such thing. It's obvious that Gilbert's more of an anthropologist than a homemaker and so what?   To me, this is far greater than a beach-read! It reads more like a textbook sometimes with all the foreign words and phrases she teaches us. The cast of characters is fantastic. The fact that \\"Luca Spaghetti\\" is a real person blows my mind.   I think thatall writers receive criticism and that often the very writers who inspire some people, aggravate others no end. Marriage and children and the sacrifices they require are part and parcel of life all over the world, and anyone who thumbs her nose at the nuclear-family dream in favor of a more world-centered dream is going to be criticized especially when she is paid to gallivant all over Italy eating pizza. It's just too envy-inducing for words. But I say more power to her. Most of us know that we wouldn't do a life swap--so why not just live vicariously and see this for what it is--another person on a journey. I found it to be an interesting take on the world and some of what it has to offer.

B00007KWHN|5.0|The Yes Album was Yes' third album, being recorded in the Autumn of 1970 and released in February 1971. It would be the first to feature guitarist Steve Howe who joined the band after the recording of Time and a Word. This album also marked the band's first collaboration with co-producer Eddie Offord although he had been an engineer on Time and a Word. The album was also a turning point for the band both artistically and financially. Whereas both the first two Yes albums showed great potential, they were also somewhat hit and miss with the first being the better of the two. The Yes Album was the first great Yes record from beginning to end while also being their first record to sell well. Of the six songs on the original release, all are considered classics with songs like Yours Is No Disgrace, Clap, I've Seen All Good People and Perpetual Change still turning up in the live shows 40 years later. All of these songs were also FM staples on the radio for many, many years. The Rhino remaster improves the sound quality on the previous issues as well as including the single edits of Your Move and Starship Trooper as well as an unreleased studio version of Clap.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|I wasn't a great Bon Jovi fan but thought I would give them a go by buying their greatest hits cd. After listening to it I realised that they had hit after hit throughout their 25 or so years and that made them a good band.  Now that is all I listen to because I just love it.  In fact I lent it to a friend and they loved it so much they went out and got their own copy.  Highly recommended.

B004CR5TD0|4.0|Every year or so, someone new is appointed as the \\"savior of electronic music.\\" In 2011, that title fell to James Blake and his eponymous debut. And? It's actually quite a good piece of work. Blake's interest leans on the possibilities of the manipulation of his own voice -- in \\"Unluck,\\" he turns himself into an electrified chorus, while on \\"I Never Learned to Share,\\" the processed and unprocessed come into conflict, a sort of laryngeal sibling rivalry. He forms his own a cappella group on \\"Measurements.\\" If there's a drawback to Blake's method, it's that too many tracks have the same song structure: starts with vocals, slow introduction of the beat and the electronics, build, end. \\"Lindisfarne II\\" gives it a folk twist, but some more structural variation would probably be welcome. That said, what he does, he does well. The soul piano on \\"Limit to Your Love\\" and the short and glitchy \\"Why Don't You Call Me\\" shows that he has a knack for melody. It's most evident on \\"The Wilhelm Scream,\\" the closest he's come to a 'hit,' takes familiar R&B tropes and converts them into a quiet, creeping sadness that builds upon its silences while slowly filling the empty spaces with buzzing layers of sound. A strong debut, but one that shows Blake has plenty of room to grow.

B005NA3B8U|4.0|Worth every penny! Retro side-scroll shooters are my favorite type of game.  The controls work fine on my Nook Color, though sometimes they get in the way. My only gripe is this game is stupid hard! Ive played level four at least a hundred times! Now i enjoy a challenge but its a little much with this game. Wish there was an easy mode, I might stop playing simply due to frustration.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Thank you Amazon for shipping the right edition of the movie. Ordered mine on Sep 20th and immediately called CS to check which version they're shipping and they assured me that it was the remastered version.   I wish if Amazon would edit the title of the movie by adding [REMASTERED] on the page. My disk has the following:  1) Slip cover without the words [2-DISK SET] AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT of the back cover above the Paramount logo.  2) Actual case having the yellow UPC code and the words [2-DISK SET] at the bottom right of the back cover.  I was only 100% sure I got the remastered version when I popped the disk and saw the movie title [GLADIATOR] in black and staying black after it faded away.

It is really hard for the first week but after that it becomes habit.  Good luck.

B0058VW36U|1.0|The 2 levels I was able to play were fun... but every time I have tried to play I get past the first or second level and the game freezes, needing to be force closed. I installed it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I had waited and waited for this game to become free, but I finally broke down and bought it. I can't stop playing it. I think I may even dream of it. I'm so happy that my friends and random strangers can get it for free. It is a great game. And it works really well on my Optimus T.

B003YK42LQ|4.0|Had no problems with this album the CD work fine and load into iTunes, no DRM. Must be the plastic case. Got another from goHastings and the cover was vary torn up. But the price was great!

B005804N9G|3.0|I have been a huge Dreamtheater fan for a long, long time. In fact, they are tied for my favorite band with OSI and Transatlantic. I always have high expectations for Dreamtheater because I know what they are capable of. Unfortunately  , the last few albums have not been their best work. However, it's Dreamtheater so even their worst music is top quality stuff compared to most bands out there! For my tastes, Images and Words, Awake, Scenes From a Memory and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence are all 5 out of 5 albums while Falling Into Infinity and A Change of Seasons are both 4 out of 5 stars. Octovarium is a 3 out of five while Systematic Chaos, Train of Thought and Black Clouds and Silver Linings are all 2 out of 5. Now this is all based on the Dreamtheater scale (compared other Dreamtheater music). If you compare to all music in general than add a star to everything mentioned above where Images and Words is a 6 out of 5 and Octovarium is a 4 out of 5. So where does Dramatic Turn of Events fall? I would say it's on the level of Octovarium putting it at a 3 out of 5 for Dreamtheater or 4 out of 5 for music in general. Here's a breakdown of the songs:  On Backs of Angels: 4 out of 5 (best lyrics on album, best chorus on album, a great piano bit, some annoying keyboard parts though, otherwise it would be my favorite song on the album if the keyboards were better)  Build Me up Break Me Down: 3 out of 5 (good lyrics, good chorus, ok music, not bad but not near my favorite of the album)   Lost Not Forgotten: 1 out of 5 (horrible singing parts really bring this song down to the level of pure annoyance for me)  This Is The Life: 5 out of 5 (an awesome song! My favorite on the album! Great lyrics, singing by James and awesome piano by Rudess and guitar solo by petrucci)  Bridges in the Sky: 3 out of 5 (good chorus and decent lyrics overall. cool subject matter, a real trip! good musicianship)  Outcry: 2 out of 5 (some real moments of genus mixed in with some B-side quality material that brings the quality down for the song overall. good lyrics though and I love the message! If I gave bonuses for message it would get a 3 out of 5 but I only rate the musical/lyrical quality)   Far from Heaven: 3 out of 5 (good to see James writing lyrics again! great piano and good lyrics)  Breaking All Illusions: 3 out of 5 (cool beginning and bass lines at 2:30 mark. great musicianship and great lyrics by Myung! I love the jazzy part at the five minute mark!)   Deep Beneath the Surface: 3 out of 5 (really awesome keyboard solo at 3:20! almost gave it a 4 out of 5 just for that! lyrics are okay, a little too repetative but the guitar is a nice acoustic piece of music that is heartfelt and a  poem to portnoy from petrucci by my estimation, i could be wrong about that)  _________________  Add all the points up and you get 27. Divide that by 9 (number of songs) and you get 3. So there you go. 3 out of 5. Or 4 out of 5 compared to non-DT league music. I hope they can do better and I know they can! I think not writing and recording at once is going to help. letting the music gel for a while and improving upon it before recording it is the key to them working out all the kinks in their otherwise brilliant music! Until they improve though I will gladly listen to this album because even weak DT is still awesome music and I can always use more DT! If tapes were still around I would have gone thru many tapes of the same albums of their prior work as I listen to that much DT!   Some fans may dislike all the ballads but they are some of the best material on the album (especially \\"This Is The Life) so I very much enjoyed them! Plus I love Rudess piano and this gives him an excuse to show off his classical skills.   I really hope the whole band can mend their relationships with portnoy. they are a family and need to start acting like one! put their petty issues aside and forgive eachother no matter who started it or is at fault the most. i always admired them as a mature band with no divorces, happy marriages, families, mature subject matter in songs, religion is priority to some band members and being able to get along and not get addicted to drugs (other than portnoy who overcame and has been sober for over ten years and wasn't that bad when he was stuggeling with alcoholism) or be part of any other drama or shinanagins until this whole deal with portnoy quitting. they should start acting like the adults i know they are! I hope they \\"get back together again\\" if you will. not that i think portnoy will join the band again other than for a one off promo type gig but that portnoy and petrucci will be good friends again. they have been best buds for over 25 years and can't throw it away now! there wives and kids are friends and they have shared a lifetime together making great music and defying the music industry with great success! i know portnoy got a little selfish and threw a small hissyfit and was a general pain in the butt to the other members but come on! hes worth it! and if you could all get along for so long why give up now? you've been thru too much to give in now.   Also I do like Portnoy's drumming quite a bit better than Mangini. Its more interesting, exciting, audible and fun! Mangini is good but kinda blends in so much its just mediocre without ever jumping out and wowing you--this could change next album as Mangini becomes more involved in the writing and not just filling in a session drummer like the role he played on this album. plus mangini was pushed back in the mix somewhat so that could be influencing my impressions of his drumming being not quite as good as portnoy's. portnoy is a distinctive drummer and is addicting to listen too. i will surely miss his drumming in DT even though his controlling ways and insisting on writing and recording at the same time were holding the band back.  i love you guys keep rocking!
B005MW5CWW|5.0|Seriously, i love Mastodon, and while i always thought they were awesome, Crack the Skye might possibly be the greatest rock album of all time. Kind of tough to follow that act. So what did Mastodon do? Only put out an excellent album, in what might be considered a progressive build from their earlier efforts. The album is seamless, although the overall vibe is a bit more diverse than the last album, which was more of a continuous story/concept. I have jammed it twice so far, and my first impressions are highly favorable, which for me means the album will only keep getting better as i jam it even more.<br />The earlier reviews were pretty detailed, but i thought i would lend my own thoughts for those considering the album...BUY IT! I feel like you owe it to yourself. I know it was a sweet reward for me. Enjoy!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a quite entertaining time killer. I actually purchased this game and am a little upset that it's now the FAOTD, but the game is worth .99 if you ask me.   There are some more challenging levels that do require replaying a couple times to get all three stars. This game also requires a little quick thinking on some of the levels. I am now replaying to get all three stars as I have completed all the boxes. Can't wait for new levels!!
B004SBBDB2|5.0|And blacker too (a plus for at least blending in better).  It's hard to argue with the price, and the audio/video is as good as the apple cables (I already have a set for one of my HDTVs).  The included USB cable allows for charging, so this can make a decent replacement for a fancier dock.  An added plus is that these, unlike some 3rd party TV docks, allow for anything the iPod/iPhone can output (ie Netflix, Pandora, etc...) not just old school music/videos.
0061537969|5.0|When I picked up this book I really wasn't sure if I would like it, but I was wrong, dead wrong. Not only could I not put it down but it got to me, it made me feel hope, it changed me. I wasn't in a great place when I picked it up and I can honestly say it gave me hope.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|They did not learn from the big mistake in Revenge of the Sith with how Darth Vader ruined the movie with his NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Now they put it in Return of the Jedi as Vader picks up the Emperor and tosses him down the reactor core. Yea I will stick to my Original VHS that I bought back in the 80's. Sorry George your time is now past. Step down as CEO and let someone with a sense of stability and leave the movies alone.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The trilogy definitely weakens as it goes along. I loved the first book, but as I went along it all seemed a little implausible. I know, it's fiction, but I had a hard time believing that that many people would protect such a horrible man, when in my opinion they had no real reason to. Enjoyable though.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I've been a huge Opeth fan for many years, and Ghost Reveries tops my list. Through Mikael and Steven Wilson, I've gone on this fascinating musical journey back to the 70s to bands I never knew existed - Scott Walker, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Blackwater Park, Vangelis, etc. etc. - and this album feels like an honest, authentic tribute to those influences. Mikael has a fantastic singing voice, and I love his mellow music even though I'm a metal fan. This is like Atonement from Ghost Reveries, my favourite song. It's so nice not to hear him screaming but instead using textured vocals, acoustic instruments, keyboards, etc. To me it feels like an album that draws from his influences without any concern for what the metal community would demand of it.<br /><br />In short, this is the Opeth I like, the prog, acoustic, mellow, complex, thought-provoking Opeth - not screaming metal Opeth. So if you're looking for screaming Opeth, this album is not for you, but if you want profound, thoughtful, philosophical Opeth, got get it. It's my #2 Opeth album next to Ghost Reveries.<br /><br />Plus, it's the coolest album cover ever!

B004ZNA5JO|5.0|Being a Pink Floyd fan since the 1970s, I've amassed a huge collection of their music.  I remember being really excited for this album when it hit in 1987. At the time, it was quite controversial being the first album without Roger Waters.  As much as I hate to say this, this album needed remastering from the day it was released.  Even the \\"remaster\\" that was included in the original Shine On boxed set didn't sound as good as it should have.  Thankfully this re-release fixes that.  Gone is the muddy, bled-together sound, replaced by crystal clear bliss. Nothing seems buried in the mix this time around.  The subtleties are all there, so slap on the headphones and enjoy!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|My department is very small and with this attachment really sack of trouble and I can play in my room without problems of any kind, you recognize me perfectly and now I can enjoy my Kinect 100%

B005J4TLN4|2.0|Although I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, I was extremely disappointed! Essentially a remake of Critters without the take-no-prisoners bounty hunters, this story tries hard to develop likeable characters that you soon find yourself wishing would be among the next casualties! No explanation is ever given for why the aliens come to earth, or how the seemingly low-intelligence creatures managed to develop space travel. Nick Frost is completely underused as the marijuana caretaker, providing only a minor supporting role in the film. While the overall acting is convincing, there are several sub-plots that never develop enough to bolster the implausible storyline. The illuminated teeth of the creatures that dim when dead is a clever innovation, but actors running around in gorilla suits is pedestrian at best! Do not misunderstand, I am an avid fan of mindless sci-fi creature films like Slither, Feast, and The Hidden; however, this one just does not develop into anything whatsoever memorable. Sorry to be on the opposing side of those who found the movie to their liking, but the incohesive nature of this film made it fall way short of my expectations!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I recommend this game to anyone who can take advantage of today's promotion.  This is a fun little game that works well on smartphones.  It's a physics based game and I like it.

0817439390|5.0|This is a class in a book.  I did some photography long ago, but I'm fairly novice to the DSLR world.  After the first few pages of Bryan's book I was shooting in Manual mode with MANY successful results. I have not resorted to the dreaded Auto mode since. Peterson speaks in plain language complete with loads of analogies for us right-brain learners. This book (in my opinion) goes from Photography 101 to something like 301 as you progress, so it's wise to follow his prompts and do the exercises he recommends as you go, then re-read it with your new understandings. I see a lot of people running around with the \\"big camera\\" but producing low-quality, non-creative shots, or worse, spending a lot of time in post-processing trying to get the correct result. This book will ensure I spend a lot more time behind my camera and a lot less in post-processing.  I HIGHLY recommend for anyone new or semi-new to photography, or anyone professional who is in a slump.  It is worth noting that Bryan is mostly a landscape photographer, so most of his lessons are designed with that end in mind. There is little-to-no information about indoor or people/portrait photography. However, mastery of creative exposure is the point and that applies to ALL photography. I also have watched his video streams (which you can only access if you have the book), and they provide some of the same information, but also some additional information re; his techniques. Currently I am reading through the book now for the second time, and picking up a lot of things I missed or didn't understand the first time through. This book is GOOD bang for your buck.

Simple objectives that anyone can pick up and play.  The only frustration that may come about is trying to get all 3 candies per level which becomes a lot of trial-and-error and luck as well.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|&lt;strong>The Help&lt;/strong> (Tate Taylor, 2011)<br /><br />By any technical metric you would care to name, &lt;em>The Help&lt;/em> is an unqualified success. Writer/director Tate Taylor, normally an actor (&lt;em>Winter's Bone&lt;/em>), hit one out of the park in almost every imaginable way with this movie, only his second full-length feature behind the camera. Every cast member is excellent in his or her role, and a roster of solid performers all bring their A games to the table. The script is warm, funny (which I did not expect at all), and exceptionally well-paced. The cinematography is very pretty, if conventional. Even the soundtrack is manipulative without being too obtrusive (Thomas Newman > John Williams, but then these days everyone > John Williams). In other words, as a surface feature, or looked at as an entirely separate phenomenon than the book, &lt;em>The Help&lt;/em> is an unqualified success, one that deserves every bit of its hype and the almost-in-the-top-250 rating it has on IMDB as I write this.<br /><br />On the other hand, Hollywood, we need to sit down and have a talk about two phenomena prominently on display in this movie that have pissed a whole lot of people off. I'm not sure I'm the right person to have this talk with you, Hollywood, since I'm a white, almost-middle-aged male writing from a position of (at least relative) privilege. But you don't listen when black folks talk about it, even the black folks you seem to be so fond of. Maybe it'll sound different coming from someone else.<br /><br />First off: let's talk a little about the Magical Negro. (Those of you not reading this on Amazon who have never heard the term can find out a great deal more about it on wikipedia: [link removed for Amazon consumption].) What's up with that? Are we somehow incapable of mixing races in a mainstream Hollywood film without adding a Magical Negro trope? (The last film I remember that did so successfully was Wes Craven's &lt;em>The Serpent and the Rainbow&lt;/em> twenty-five years ago.) While there can be no doubting that Constantine (played here by the great Cicely Tyson--coincidentally, aunt to Cathy Tyson, who was so distinctly non-magical in &lt;em>The Serpent and the Rainbow&lt;/em>) fits the trope to a T, did you really have to go our of your way to hit every signpost? Couldn't you have made her, you know, a real, flesh-and-blood character? I realize that a superhuman ideal is great for tugging on the heartstrings when the inevitable confrontation occurs (we know from the movie's first five minutes that something has happened to Constantine, we just don't know what), and if your goal is to get people to get out the tissues while still in the theater, good on ya, you achieved your objective. If you want people to actually empathize with the character, so you get butts in seats for repeat showings despite outrageous ticket prices, however, you want to create a character who people can actually identify with. This is why the bean counters are more interested in the second week's gross for a film (and the percentage drop) than the media, who couldn't care less about anything but opening weekend. How many butts came &lt;em>back&lt;/em> for a second viewing? Like any other trope, the Magical Negro is a cardboard cutout, a person with little if any personality, a projection of the ideals of the screenwriter rather than a fully fleshed-out character. And like any other cardboard character, we look at them, we pity them... but we don't identify with them. We don't care.<br /><br />Second: for the love of god, Hollywood, you have suffered from this sickness as long as I've known you. In fact, from what I hear from people older than I am, you've suffered from it as long as you've been around. And it's time someone told you about it. It's this habit you have of optioning books, and then hiring screenwriters whose sole purpose, it seems, is to strip out any part of the book that might actually provoke thought. Now,before I launch into this diatribe, I will say right up front I have not yet read the book. I spent the drive home from the cinema listening to my wife detail the differences between book and film, and then went and backed that up with some research. While I understand that books need to be dumbed down for Hollywood for time constraints if nothing else (note: I don't know a single person who would have complained if Jackson's Lord of the Rings adaptations had been three times as long and included, you know, the rest of the story), it's the changes that are made that define whether an adaptation has an agenda or not. I love the way Mark Blankenship puts it, writing at The Critical Condition: \\"Though it tells roughly the same story as the novel, it makes several small changes that seriously upend the racial balance. Much more than the novel, the movie is a story about white people being awesome and noble.\\" For example, Abilene's final monologue in the film speaks to oh-look-how-empowered-I-am-now!, and without knowing what happens immediately after that, the viewer is inclined to think \\"hey, you know, she owes a [censored for Amazon consumption] of a lot to Skeeter\\", rather than \\"hey, Abilene used this newly-cultivated writing ability to go take Skeeter's old job at the Jackson Journal, which is why Mae Mobley was Abilene's last white child\\". We go from Abilene being passively grateful to Abilene actively being &lt;em>empowered&lt;/em>. It makes me wonder how those who say the movie stuck so close to the book actually find a way to believe that. While we're on the subject of Abilene, stopping her first conversation with Skeeter at the \\"I drank too much coffee\\" joke makes for a nice feel-good scene, to be sure. It never gets into the subject which is actually supposed to be at the heart of the movie: &lt;em>why&lt;/em> Abilene had seventeen white children--the process of inculcation those white children went through that starts with \\"you're my real mommy, Abilene!\\" and ends with Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), a Klansman in lipstick. That's not something you can simply take out and still have a movie that's functionally the same as the book; it's a &lt;em>main theme&lt;/em>. It would be like, for example, taking John W. Campbell's novella \\"Who Goes There?\\" and making it into a film where the monster isn't a shapeshifter and there are women in the story. (Oh, wait, Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks did that in 1951 and called it &lt;em>The Thing from Another World&lt;/em>. John Carpenter's 1982 adaptation &lt;em>The Thing&lt;/em> is much closer to the original source material--and a far superior film.) And I haven't even touched on the whole Rachel debacle, mostly because that's what most critics (and I here use the term in the sense of \\"people who are pillorying this adaptation\\") touch on when they're looking at scenes that, in Blankenship's somewhat euphemistic language, \\"seriously upend the racial balance.\\"<br /><br />I know how I sound here, and I feel kind of guilty about it. I know at least half of you reading this are staring at the screen with a slightly cocked expression thinking \\"why does a white guy care about this stuff?\\". For the same reason I care about the fact that Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks changed what is, arguably, the most terrifying monster ever seen in a horror novella (so wonderfully recreated by Rick Baker in the eighties) into James Arness in a suit that makes him look like giant rutabaga. Because these things are in the book, and the reason they are in the book is because the author felt they were important enough to include in the book. Because these changes were made specifically for the purpose of pulling in audiences (and the fact that I feel I have to parenthetically add that I mean &lt;em>white&lt;/em> audiences is telling), which brings up concepts of art vs. capital and which one always wins in the end if you put up with the Hollywood machine. But more than either of those things it's because &lt;em>this is our history&lt;/em>. This is our culture. And whether you're willing to admit it or not, Hollywood, how the generations below mine conceive of our history and culture in past time periods has a whole [censored for Amazon consumption] of a lot more to do with how you portray it than with what they read in history books, so every time you choose to sanitize some seemingly-niggling piece of detail in order to make something more palatable, you are potentially changing the historical viewpoint of &lt;em>an entire generation of moviegoers&lt;/em>. This is doubly distressing when you realize that even in cultures where there is a thriving film industry (Nigeria, India, Turkey, Ghana, New Zealand, France, and England all come to mind), the importation, distribution, and screening of American films, especially high-grossing Hollywood fare, is a billions-of-dollars-a-year business. &lt;em>Billions&lt;/em>. And you know how much is in a Ghanian schoolkid's history book about US history? As much as there is in an American kid's schoolbook about the history of Ghana... which means that all those kids overseas, assuming they're not told any different by older relatives who are far more in touch with world events than most Americans of the same age, have no other recourse for figuring out what actually happened.<br /><br />And needless to say, if you do realize all of this and you're still doing it? That's not neglectful. That's evil. That's The Party (a la Orwell) [censored for Amazon consumption]. \\"We are at war with Eurasia. We have always been at war with Eurasia.\\" becomes \\"blacks are free in America only because white people fought for their civil rights.\\" And a century from now when there's no one left alive who was actually there, no one left to set the story straight, what happens?<br /><br />Wow. Maybe I went a little overboard when I was doing that research. And it really is a testament to Taylor (who, I just read, is a \\"longtime friend\\" of Stockett's, though no details were given) that despite my outrage, which keeps growing the more I think about those \\"minor\\" changes, I can still turn around and recommend this movie without hesitation. To reiterate, this cast is outrageously good, and many of them are giving their best performances in years. I can't remember Sissy Spacek, whose role in the film is far too small for her character's irrepressible personality, having been this good in a movie since &lt;em>'night, Mother&lt;/em> in 1986. Allison Janney is always a treat. Emma Stone came into her own last year in &lt;em>Easy A&lt;/em>, and she does just as well here. Viola Davis, nominated for an Oscar for her work in &lt;em>Doubt&lt;/em>, fills the role of Abilene with a warmth and comfort rarely seen on a screen, and Octavia Spencer, who I think has been in every movie that's come out in the past ten years, is a perfect foil for her as trash-talking, hyper-caffeinated Minnie. And I'm just scratching the surface here. It's a [censored for Amazon consumption] of a roster, and it seems to me that everyone involved believed in the film just as passionately as did Taylor; enough, at least, to have all acted their hearts out. And as far as all the behind-the-scenes stuff goes, it's all very well executed, though I doubt anyone's going to be winning awards for, say, sound mixing here. So see it. But I beg you: please think about the process involved in making it after you do. Go out on the web and do the research, or read the book yourself, and then spend some quality time thinking about not just the empirical changes that were made, but the ways in which those changes affect how you think about the characters. Or, far more importantly, how Tate Taylor, who did the adaptation, and Dreamworks, who released the film, &lt;em>wanted&lt;/em> you to think about the characters. (How much of the finished film was Taylor's actual screenplay and how much was studio interference is one of those questions to which it's almost impossible to get a good answer, where any film is concerned; even the \\"director's cut\\" of any given mainstream movie, unless it's self-released, still goes through the studio system, the MPAA, etc. And, of course, if studio interference happens before shooting, pieces of screenplay may never get filmed.) Using the film as a springboard to think about the Hollywood studio system and the way it sanitizes history is far more useful than using it as \\"rah rah rah, white people helped the poor [censored for Amazon consumption] out of their misery and now everything's peachy!\\" propaganda. *** ½tions below mine conceive of our history and culture in past time periods has a whole [censored for Amazon consumption] of a lot more to do with how you portray it than with what they read in history books, so every time you choose to sanitize some seemingly-niggling piece of detail in order to make something more palatable, you are potentially changing the historical viewpoint of <em>an entire generation of moviegoers</em>.

Go out on the web and do the research, or read the book yourself, and then spend some quality time thinking about not just the empirical changes that were made, but the ways in which those changes affect how you think about the characters. Or, far more importantly, how Tate Taylor, who did the adaptation, and Dreamworks, who released the film, <em>wanted</em> you to think about the characters. (How much of the finished film was Taylor's actual screenplay and how much was studio interference is one of those questions to which it's almost impossible to get a good answer, where any film is concerned; even the \\"director's cut\\" of any given mainstream movie, unless it's self-released, still goes through the studio system, the MPAA,etc. And, of course, if studio interference happens before shooting, pieces of screenplay may never get filmed.) Using the film as a springboard to think about the Hollywood studio system and the way it sanitizes history is far more useful than using it as \\"rah rah rah, white people helped the poor [censored for Amazon consumption] out of their misery and now everything's peachy!\\" propaganda. *** ½
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Just got my complete set of this time-honored series \\"Married... with Children\\" and I am so excited because this was absolutely my very favorite sitcom of its time.  Here are all the details about this set, also be sure to check out the pictures that I scanned and posted of everything:  This is a 32 disc set of all 11 seasons. These are the exact same discs that came with the previous stand-alone sets. This includes in total 261 episodes, which is roughly 5,900 minutes of video from the series. The runtime of each of the eps ranges from just over 22 minutes to about 24 minutes in total inclusive of the opening and closing credits. All of the eps (with the exception of the \\"lost ep\\" that remained un-broadcast for years) are arranged in their original broadcast order.    Season 1 is spread out on 2 discs, and the other 10 seasons are spread out onto 3 discs each. Each disc includes a vibrantly color silkscreen picture on it.   These are region 1, single sided discs. The audio is mastered in Dolby digital, the aspect ratio is full screen, 1.33:1 and subtitles are not included although closed captioning is. One more thing that's prudent to mention, these are bona fide DVD video discs, not DVD-R or DVD+R discs that some studios are now starting to use more frequently. Also one more thing to note because this is important to some people, the set was made in the USA.  This is packaged in a large bookcase with a quadruple-sized digipack inside it. The digipack includes 2 large spindles, each with roughly half the series on each side of it.   The discs are held into each of the spindles by cardboard adapters. I mention this because you do not want to lose the cardboard adaptors because the discs are not locked into place on their own. Also be sure to handle them with care so they don't bend or break.   The discs include an average of 6-9 eps per disc (although a handful of the discs have less). All of the discs (with the exception of season 2) are clearly marked with the season number, disc number and many of the discs even include the range of eps from the specific season on them. The only exception is that \\"Season 2\\" is not marked on the Season 2 discs.   Special features include the cast reunion from 2003 (this was great to see again) with season 1. And some of the other seasons include \\"Easter eggs\\" which are brief cast commentaries (these are from the same 2003 cast reunion special) hidden on some of the discs. Some of the discs also include \\"exclusive Sony previews\\", these are more or less just trailers for other stuff that Sony is trying to unload. And finally, included is the infamous \\"lost Bundy ep\\" \\"I'll See You In Court\\". For some reason this ep turns up in an edited form, however.  Absent from this set (as well as all other DVD sets of this classic series) is the original unaired pilot (which had a different Bud and a different Kelly) and some of the \\"Married... with Children\\" network specials throughout the original series run.  An actual episode guide/booklet is not included. However the back of the inlay includes all of the disc contents and episode titles. Although it would have been nice if Sony would have included a booklet, I have purchased other budget sets that didn't even include the inlay so I was glad to see it. But if you're a fan of the series you probably already know what just about every show is about, also you would be reticent not to find an episode guide of \\"Married... with Children\\" online.   All of the discs include colorful main menus with a screen imposed with episode-specific screen shots for each of the eps on the discs. I have tried out the discs on my Sony blu-ray player and Panasonic blu-ray player, as well as some of my older DVD players and cheapo under the counter kitchen DVD player and all of the discs seem to play fine. There is no skipping and no compatiblity issues withsoever. I should also say that the picture and sound quality is excellent.    Although some of the eps are edited and some of the music is changed I can hardly find anything else to complain about. This is such an awesome series and at this price they're practically giving it away. I say if you have any interest in the series snatch up your copy now because the price could go up or it could sell out.  Some background about the show, which, if you're here you may already know:  The star of the series is Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill, he was the best pick for this role, I cannot imagine anyone else as the iconic Al Bundy). Al is the perpetual, typical husband who just can't catch a break no matter how hard he tries. Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal who was always able to deliver the sharpest cracks) is Al's love-starved wife. Peggy is just as horny as she is lazy. The woman has a serious aversion to work and enjoys passing her time smoking on the couch, watching Oprah and eating bonbons. Bud Bundy (David Faustino, who was also first-rate in all of his Bud incarnations over the years) is Al and Peg's son. Bud is totally the most intelligent person in this family, however he often gets sidetracked if there's a hot chick involved. Kelly (Christina Applegate, who played the hottest and dumbest blonde on TV since Chrissy Snow) is the daughter of the family and such a sweet girl. Kelly has lofty dreams of being a model but first she'll need to master the art of turning a doorknob. Al can often be seen defending his daughter's honor because he wouldn't ever allow anyone to take advantage of his little \\"Pumpkin.\\" As a matter of fact, even though he'd never admit it, Al is just as protective of both Peggy and Bud, too.   I gotta say Ed O'Neill was absolutely perfect. He played the hopeless and harried shoe salesman with such finesse, it truly is a shame he didn't get nominated for an Emmy because he more than deserved it. Ed was always believable, always hysterical and had some of the best facial expressions of any sitcom character in recent memory.   Rounding out this very interesting group of characters is Marcy D'Arcy, you gotta love that name (Amanda Bearse who exceptionally played a character that got more and more ludicrous over the years), and Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley, who has been dubbed \\"the patron saint of shark-jumping\\") the Bundys' neighbors. Marcy and Al have a very serious hatred for each other. I think this is because both are threatened by each other; Al is a man who isn't afraid to say what he wants and Marcy is a total man-hater.   Jefferson is Marcy's pretty boy second hubby. He's basically the male version of Peggy. Steve Rhoades (David Garrison) was Marcy's first-hubby who dumped her quicker than a dirty towel in a men's room truck stop to become a park ranger. It was wonderful to see David come back to the series for pretty frequent eps over the years. The debate over who was better, Steve or Jefferson will probably go on for years to come. I say, some of the very best eps are with Steve, but I like Jefferson better because he added a unique aspect to the show.  Some of my favorite eps are also some of your favorite eps, I'm sure:  Earth Angel / Season 2 / disc 1 - Bud picks up a hot blonde he meets who doesn't have any place to go. When Al sees her in her slinky nighty he plays the bedroom Bossanova with Peggy all night long. My favorite part is when Peggy comes running down the stairs in the morning to tell Tiffany to stay, forever.   Master The Possibilities / Season 2 / disc 1 - Buck gets a credit card and Al and Peggy go on a spending spree. My favorite part is the very end when Al has to \\"work off\\" his debt with the hotel by scrubbing some fat woman's back.   Impo-Dent / Season 2 / disc 3 - Steve fakes a sexual dysfunction to get even with Marcy.  The Gypsy Cried / Season 3 / disc 2 - A psychic forewarns Marcy that she is in grave danger, so Marcy decides to bring along Peg and Al on a business trip for good look.   Hot Off The Grill / Season 4 / disc 1 - While planning a labor day picnic Peggy turns on Al. Meanwhile, Kelly mistakenly usethe ashes of Marcy's beloved late aunt in the barbecue. My favorite part is Steve's expression when he finds out the burger was cooked with the old lady's ashes, he just smiles and digs right in.  You Better Shop Around (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - After moving into a grocery store (because Al blacked out the entire neighborhood on the hottest day of the year with his \\"Kaiser\\" air conditioner) Al and Peggy win a supermarket shopping spree. But they have to compete against Jefferson and Marcy. The Beav even makes a special appearance in the second part.    Route 666 (part 1 & 2) / Season 5 / disc 3 - On a road trip to CA the Bundys get sidetracked in an old mining town. After hearing that there is gold in them there hills Peggy comes up with a cockamamie story claming that Kelly, Bud and Al are desperately sick, asking Marcy to wire money. When Marcy and Jefferson show up instead and learn the truth, soon the Bundys and D'Arcys become gold prospectors.   Throughout the decade+ it was on the airwaves \\"Married... with Children\\" included a ton of always funny and always in-your-face celebrity guest stars. Some of the best of the best include: Mr. Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Linda Blair, Charlene Tilton, Vanna White, Jessica Hahn, Robert Englund, Gary Coleman, Sam Kinison and Pat Morita.  The reason why I love this series so much is because it never pretended to be anything than what it was. It never preached to the audience. It never put on airs. No one tried to \\"educate\\" the viewers. No one tried to give a \\"moral\\" to the story. And most of all the reason why I consider \\"Married... with Children\\" to be the defining sitcom of the '80s (and the '90s) is because it never tried to end each show with a \\"happy ending\\". Nope. They were miserable and they were staying miserable.   Remember, love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.

B005ARYEY6|4.0|Below is the review I gave this album when it first came out. I was wrong.  It's a 5.  These performances are all about ESP.  Each is a remarkable example of \\"how the tune goes this time\\" against \\"how it went that time.\\" It always went great!<br /><br />Original review:<br />I gave it 4 stars simply because I don't give anything 5.  Frankly, I've spent too much time in the music business to believe a full-blown, stark-raving 5 star album has ever been made.  Beyond a few fluctuating volume levels in the ensemble and solos from time to time, this set of 3 live discs from the best quintet in jazz is near perfection.  I'm normally not a fan of the trend of releasing outtakes from classic albums in order to bring something new to the product with rerelease; the whole point of studio recording is to give the artist and producer the choice to record and release what they deem the very best performance of that work.  As a producer, my own feeling is that studio outtakes are just that: outtakes that should be taken out and never released for public consumption. (If the creators of that music wanted it published, they would have made that choice in the first place.  So enough preaching, already! That leaves this format of multiple live recordings of the same tunes (there are some extras thrown in) as a wonderful comparison of versions that indicate the nuances, thought patterns, and responses of the moment that are shared by great players and result in sheer musical magic.  Jazz.  This collection is an opportunity to witness for yourself why these five people are, alone and collectively, five of the greatest jazz musicians of all times (three are still adding to their personal legacies today).  Any of these live performances could have been THE take on the original studio sessions that introduced the tunes back in the day. Knowing that Miles was not a leader who tried to control the performances, but instead preferred to set the vibe and let it fly where it would, it's nothing short of remarkable to hear the shared momentary convictions in the conversations between these artists that occur so differently yet so similarly night after night.  A particular standout is the consistent musical intercourse between Hancock and Williams throughout these sets.  You can almost imagine that they carefully laid out their own map backstage before going on, extremely unlikely for a 10 minute freedom flight involving 3 other players.  Other flakes of magic occur in the opening bars of \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" on disc #3.  Miles and Herbie never played more beautifully together.  All in all, this is how five monster players seemed to use one brain and one heart to make one hell of dent in jazz history.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|I'm just absolutely shocked at the product these guys have released. I never, in a million years, would have thought that Joey would be back and that they would put it down like this.   Just one word describes this, MUBLAGNIKCUFECIN!! Long time fans will know what that means.   Each track is amazingly strong. And the album never loses steam. I wished all the older albums sounded this nice; the master level sounds AWESOME. CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH!! Crank this up on a good audio system and you will get shivers down your spine.  I can't pick any one song out of the bunch, they ALL sound great. I'm in awe.   THANK YOU, ANTHRAX! THANK YOU!!!

Aufgewachsen in einem lieblosen Milieu ohne Familie oder Freunde, hat sie vor allem eines gelernt: Auf Distanz zu gehen und sich zu sch&uuml;tzen. Nachdem Victoria am Tag ihrer Vollj&auml;hrigkeit in die Freiheit entlassen wird, wendet sie sich der einzigen Quelle zu, die ihr nicht bedrohlich erscheint: Pflanzen. Sie lernt die Sprache der Blumen und entdeckt, dass sie mit Hilfe ihrer Str&auml;u&szlig;e mit Menschen kommunizieren, ihnen sogar helfen kann.<br />So lebt Victoria in ihrer eigenen Welt und l&auml;sst au&szlig;er ihren Blumen niemanden an sich heran.<br />Einzig Grant, der Victoria aufrichtig liebt, schafft es ihren Panzer zu durchdringen und sie vor&uuml;bergehend aus ihrem inneren Gef&auml;ngnis zu befreien.

0439023513|5.0|Im dritten und letzen Teil der Panem-Trilogie geht es um den Krieg der dreizehn Distrikte gegen die Hauptstadt. Dreizehn? Jawohl! Die totgeglaubte Provinz wird zum Zufluchtsort heimatlos gewordener Fl&uuml;chtlinge, zu denen auch Katniss geh&ouml;rt, denn den zw&ouml;lften Bezirk gibt es nicht mehr.<br />Es dauert jedoch nicht lange, bis sie feststellt, dass sich die Dinge nicht unbedingt zum Besseren gewendet haben. Coin, die Pr&auml;sidentin des 13. Distrikts, scheint Pr&auml;sident Snow in Sachen Skrupellosigkeit in nichts nachzustehen. Sie setzt Katniss unter Druck, &ouml;ffentlich als Galionsfigur der Rebellion aufzutreten, als Spottt&ouml;lpel, und ist dabei nicht zimperlich. Dass Gale sich in Coins System anscheinend pudelwohl f&uuml;hlt, macht die Sache f&uuml;r sie nicht gerade leichter. Und dann ist da noch Peeta, den Snow als Repressalie gegen Katniss benutzt, damit diese sich den Rebellen nicht anschlie&szlig;t.<br />Katniss muss einige schwerwiegende Entscheidungen treffen, die sie immer tiefer in einen Krieg ziehen, den sie nicht gewollt hat, und der mittlerweile ganz Panem &uuml;berrollt. Schon bald befindet sie sich wieder in einer Art Arena, in der sie nicht nur um ihr eigenes &Uuml;berleben k&auml;mpfen muss, sondern um das Leben ihrer Familie und Freunde.<br /><br />Ich wei&szlig; gar nicht, wo ich anfangen soll.

Panem Teil nicht so gl&uuml;cklich, weil er meiner Ansicht nach nur schwer in die G&auml;nge kam, und am Ende mitten in der spannendsten Szene einfach aufh&ouml;rt, habe ich diesen Teil wie einen Fluss empfunden, der mich von Anfang an erfasst und nicht mehr losgelassen hat. Dabei arbeiten Inhalt, Aussagekraft und Schreibstil Hand in Hand, denn die intensive Erz&auml;hlweise steht der Geschichte in nichts nach.<br />Mit Staunen habe ich in manchen Kommentaren auf amazon.com gelesen, dass Rezensenten entt&auml;uscht &uuml;ber das sachte auslaufende Ende waren - sie h&auml;tten lieber einen Knaller gewollt. Das habe ich so &uuml;berhaupt nicht empfunden. Gerade das Ende war f&uuml;r mich derart eindringlich - ich konnte Katniss' Schmerz so sehr nachempfinden, dass mir dann doch ein paar Tr&auml;nchen gekommen sind. Schmerz, der weder durch plumpe Effekthascherei erzeugt wurde, sondern vielmehr durch die Intensit&auml;t der Gef&uuml;hle einer traumatisierten Heldin, die viel zu fr&uuml;h erwachsen werden musste.

0439023521|4.0|It seems like \\"The Hunger Games\\" craze is in full effect, and I have bought in. A couple have friends have told me that they cannot put this book down, so I bought it to see what it was all about. As soon as the first chapter Collins, the author, has you hooked into a fantasy world that is eerily feasible.  This new country on old American soil seems real enough to be happening in the near future. The United States is in ruins, and a new country has risen up to power. The government rules the people with an iron fist and to remind the people not to up rise they have an annual contest called the hunger games. This is when each state or district must send two teenagers to an arena and fight to the death.<br /><br />What makes this book different from any other fantasy. I believe it is the characters. The protagonist is easily likeable yet flawed, and her two love interests are the same. Towards the end, the reader truly feels for their plight and will become emotionally involved in the story. This book is a must read, if only to be able to discuss it with the millions who are doing it also.
0195117298|3.0|I slogged through this, and believe me, when you slog through a book about the nature of time, you slog.  This one was wearing, but I persevered.  Finally, about three quarters of the way through, I think I grasped the concept. I don't, however, agree with it.  But, read it if you are interested in his theory.
B0054N73EY|5.0|This is what all true Red Hot Chili Peppers fans have been waiting for.  While nothing can replace the killer guitar solos of John Frusciante, Josh Klinghoffer provides a new and interesting direction for the band, who follows up Stadium Arcadium with an unmistakable rich mix of rock, pop, funk, and poet vocals.  Check out especially \\"Factory of Faith\\" and \\"Brendan's Death Song.\\"

B0058VW36U|4.0|Absolutley love Cut the Rope. It's fun, cute, difficult at times the game has been but together very well and rendered beautifully. Game play is smooth and a blast on my Samsung Fascinate. I enjoy Cut the Rope 10 times more than that game about pissed off birds.<br /><br />The only con is that it needs MORE NEW LEVELS! I have beat everything with 3 stars and it has been months. The game about pissed of birds gets new levels almost every other month.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|great job Dev.  not sure when I will be using it but it will come I handy.  I love how it replicates the text almost perfectly.  get this on a tablet and you'll make millions  very cool!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book (and the whole series too!)!! It was a compelling story full of expertly created characters. Suzanne Collins has the ability to create unique worlds where you can escape with the characters. You feel what they feel and are put into the ethically challenging situations that she puts her characters into. I have read this series two times over and intend on reading it again before the movie comes out. I know some people have given this a poor review but what they fail to remember is that it is just a story. READ IT!! You'll love it!!
B001AQT0OU|4.0|This film and Lolita were neglected when it comes to special features and it's a shame.  They both deserve much more in the way of special features, especially when compared to Kubrick's other films.  Otherwise, pick this film up!  It's worth the price to get the best presentation this film has ever had in a home viewing format.  No noticeable DNR, good grain reproduction, and outstanding audio are huge pluses.  Note on framing: The framing on this BD of Barry Lyndon is not strictly how Kubrick had envisioned it, however, it is VERY close.  So close, that only those with the most discerning eye will notice, let alone be distracted by it.  I'm a huge Kubrick fan, and compared this to my older DVD copy, and although there is a slight difference in composition, you will most likely not notice it.  I feel it does not detract from the film.  If you're a stickler for original framing, you'll likely pass this up, but at this price I'd advise against it.  I do see WB releasing an anniversary edition at some point - and I'll probably get it - where they MIGHT change the aspect ration to the original, but it's not likely.  And to wait for something that might not happen isn't worth it when you see how amazing this transfer is.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I hoped that the problem with this game loading slowly was from getjar but this version is just as bad, slow to the point of almost fcing each time you select a level from the menu. Fantastic game though!
B001AQMBJG|4.0|OK, again, I'm biased to liking Kubrick's films, so I'll not comment on the film itself.  This BD release of Kubrick's Lolita is incredible.  There's a good representation of film grain, without over-use or even noticeable DNR.  Any issues with contrast of this B/W film are inherent to the source, and over-all seem right on target.  The audio is as it should be and has been nicely cleaned up without anything out of the ordinary.  The only thing missing are any decent special features.  There's the trailer of course, but that's it!  This film and Barry Lyndon were neglected when it comes to special features and it's a shame.  They both deserve much more in the way of special features. Pick this film up!  It's far superior to the remake, and it's never looked better in a home viewing format despite it's lack of special features.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films and I don't think I could ever grow tired of it. The music alone is reason to watch this movie. Try it on blu ray, it's even more beautiful!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I recomend very much this movie, if you don't understand economy this your movie.  Explain you all about of financial world.
B0058VW36U|5.0|High quality game.. very well done aesthetically and programmatically, nice smooth physics, unique and clever ... and of course the two most successful ingredients, simple and addictive.

My one and only gripe is that the developers seem to have backburnered the Android platform: iOS has had the latest update for a long time now. let's go guys!
0553384775|1.0|I bought this book to learn something about Wall Street: how traders work, what they need to know, what guides their actions, etc.   Instead the authors describes the fantastic legs of the women he screwed and the quantity of heroine he took in per day.   If you want to know everything about his wife's legs, you should definitely purchase this book. If you want to know something about Wall Street - go for something else.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Wow!!  Lee Child takes us back to just before the first Jack Reacher novel, \\"The Killing Floor\\" and sets the stage for all that came after.  If \\"The Killing Floor\\" is labeled book 1 then this one should be labeled book 0.  The writing is smooth, the story is complex, and the ending is excellent.  Enjoy.
1439170916|5.0|Dr Mukherjee is not only a clever medic (and a scientist) but a gifted prose writer as well. I have rarely read a non-text book about medical subject so well researched and well written. This book actually is a beautiful mixture of science and fiction. This is the ideal way in which scientific stories should be written and told so that they reach maximum no of people. I felt the chapters on genteics were bit too long and lost the grip at the time of reading them. Overall enjoyed it thouroughly.I'm eagerly awaiting his next book!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I have been listening to this since it came out.  I liked the first CD but this one is so much better.  Like others said the songwriting is better.  Been a Sammy fan for a long time.  More on the solo and with Chickenfoot than VH, always liked DLR.  Can't wait for the new VH and compare, I only hope its as good as this.  Looking forward to seeing Chickenfoot when they come around here again.  Saw them last year and it was a killer show.
B005ELZKWS|3.0|CHICKENFOOT III,  The VAN HALEN album is far superior then this , makes this look boring as hell, this has some moments but not much , VH is the real deal  Its their second effort , if you enjoyed the first you will love this . It continues along in the same vein . Its middle of the road rock , pleasant to listen to but nothing special.  PLEASE dont expect VAN HALEN cause you will only be dissapointed , its not in the same league , think of them as a 90s MR BIG but not as exciting.  UP NEXT  n LIGHTEN UP are the stand out tracks and do rock , but there the only ones . The rest just plods and never really goes anywhere  but they do expand on their first release with a few differant turns .  Satriani sounds like he phoned the solos in , their great and easily the highlight of the album  BIG FOOT is DOWN THE DRAIN/ OH YEAH part 2 , but it is pleasent without being inventive or exciting , these guys arent reinventing the wheel just polishing it .  The SONGWRITING  is the usual HAGAR style , boring n uninspired . LYRICS pretty much the same .  ANTHONY  shines on this and every other release that hes been on when he was allowed to be heard .  Smith solid as usual.  A decent album , nothing special , nothing new , a bit boring in places , its sounds decent , solos r great  .
0670022411|5.0|I finished reading this book last night (sniff). I am not kidding when I say that I am overwhelmed with sadness that the story has ended (for now). The idea of having to wait until Summer 2012 for Book 2 leaves me restless.  Let's hope the Myans are wrong about 2012 because I DO want to be around for the next edition of Diana and Matthew. [sigh]    There isn't anything more I can say about this book that other reviewers haven't said, especially Reviewer: Viviane Crystal. Out of all the reviews I read, I feel her review gives you a real taste for what the book is about: A book about Vampires and Witches, but for grownups.   It has been a long time since a book like this has put its hooks into me. The last time I was this addicted to a story was the first time I picked up a copy of Interview with a Vampire. Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned.  Those three books turned me into an insane Ann Rice fan. Then again, who wasn't back then? I mean c'mon.    But I digress...  I love how the author mixes real historical facts with fictional characters. Oh how I wanted these characters to be real! I've heard chatter that a movie is in the making. Personally, I think it should be an HBO or Showtime mini series for if it is not, I fear people will not appreciate or understand the true dynamics between Diana and Matthew.   If you love history and you love fairytales about vampires, witches and daemons, well then I have three words for you: READ THIS BOOK!

0743454537|5.0|Anna wishes more than anything that Kate, the sister she loves, were dead. In the emotionally charged novel, My Sister's Keeper, Anna, a bright and bubbly 13 year-old sues her parents for medical emancipation. Because Anna was conceived as a donor for her older sister Kate, who suffers from leukemia, Anna spends an enormous amount of her life in pain trying to keep her sister alive. Having already donated her umbilical cord, platelets, and bone marrow, her parents are now insisting she donate a kidney to save her sister's life. Anna takes a stand; she hires an attorney so she can keep her kidney and make her own medical decisions. Although Anna has grown up surrounded by love, she has been forced to make sacrifices. \\"My parents tried to make things normal, but that's a relative term. The truth is, I was never really a kid\\" (9). Anna felt all the chaos prevented her from experiencing childhood's innocence.  Picoult does an amazing job of showing the reader Anna's story from the point of view of all the major characters. Chapters quickly switch from one character to the next, but through each, we see how Kate's disease has become the center of life for this family. Anna even comments, \\"[W]e practically set a place for Death at the dinner table\\" (10). Jesse, the forgotten eldest child, acts out by setting fires, which invariably their firefighter father puts out. Although Brian, the peace-maker father understands the complex dimensions, he fruitlessly tries to please everyone. While Sara, the attorney-mother, has made healing Kate the priority in her life, and it is she that stands before the court asking to transplant Anna's kidney into Kate.  We see a family that deeply loves one another, however, each vivid and likable member grapples with what it means to love and how best to love. We can feel their individual struggles and watch as they walk though a moral mine field, attempting to avoid hurting others while protecting themselves. Anna realizes that by keeping hersister alive, she is slowly draining life from herself. She has to live for herself. However, her mother cannot give up on Kate, so the conflict grows as each becomes more determined.  Picoult, once again, delivers a compelling novel--one that even months later lingers in the reader's mind. Even the smallest details are significant; between the major plot events there are numerous minor scenes that powerfully portray what it means to be human. The lessons about love and sacrifice, while standing up for what is right, is a common theme woven throughout other Picoult novels. Readers can also see this in Keeping Faith, where Mariah learns to stand up against lawyers and doctors to protect her daughter. My Sister's Keeper is a must read for emotionally mature, female readers who are passionate about life and the difficult choices we make. If you are interested in how families suffer in the name of love, this is a book for you!
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Pink Floyd delivered big time on this set. I have bought pretty much every remake, box set these guys put out, most have impressed but this set has blown me away. i was sceptical about spending $110 on another copy of dark side of the moon. The live stuff is incredible, the sound, amazing. i have only made it through the audio discs, i cant wait to get to the DVD's and Blu=Ray. the little trinkets (scarf , marbles)2 books the black envelopes, its just insane.THIS IS A MUST HAVE and without doubt i will buy the other 2 and hope sales skyrocket and they put out immersion sets for all records in the bands arsenal..thnx to all who made these sets possible
B0045HCJR6|4.0|Enjoyed the music even though had not seen the movie in nearly 30 years. The actors and color, scenes were just as I remembered them when first seeing the movie upon the release.
B000O590I4|4.0|Listening to the first three albums of Thin Lizzy is an effort, but certainly worth it. It seems like Lynott tried to sound like Jimi or Cream, but some of the songs are not quite there. Songs like The Rocker and Little Girl in Bloom are highlights but Hero and the Madman, Slow Blues, and Song for While Away are just not good on the original album.  Now comes the Bonus CD and we have opened this album from 2* to 4*. Little Darling, Broken Dreams, Whiskey, BBC live vedsions of songs, and Sitamoia are awesome.   This is not music one may like at first sitting --just ignore the songs you don't like and concentrate on the good stuff!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|For those out there that haven't heard there is a small group of people out there comparing Tron:Legacy to The Matrix. (Yeah I know pretty silly right?) First, let me say I love both Films but, I never would even attempt to compare these two total opposites. Let me point out that The Matrix is pure rated R goodness while Tron is a DISNEY film people! Yes Disney so you already know if there is even a hint of violence in the film it would be mild at best. Newbies tend to forget that Tron:Legacy is a sequel to a film that came out way before there was a Matrix. I saw the original Tron when I was 6 years old on my uncles Laser disc (yeah, back in the stone age) then the Matrix came out around my 19th birthday and nobody was comparing those films at the time. Then here comes along Legacy and some people decide to go all looney bin WHY? all because the only thing similar between the two films is a human being entering a computer generated world and that is it!<br /> If you are a fan of the first TRON you will probably dissect the entire TRON:Legacy film but, I think you'll still like the movie overall. My only real complaints was that they could of used the 3-D better, what does that mean? well they don't start using 3-D effects until Sam enters the Grid that's over 15 minutes into the movie. I, like most people out there, would've loved to see Sam's Base jump off of the tower in full 3-D. Even Sam's motorcycle escape & evasion of the bike cop would've been cool in 3-D.<br /> I didn't like the fact that Tron:Legacy is actually Part 3 of the story. Part 2 of the story was shown to us in a brief flashback and that story seemed to be way more interesting than the Legacy story. Hopefully the next Tron film will address that flashback or maybe they just wanted us to buy the comics that explained it in TRON:Betrayal. Disney was smart with the overall look of the film. If you haven't seen the original TRON lately then let me tell you they were smart to go with the all black with outline lighting because would you have really paid to see the old look in 3-D? (I don't think so!)<br /> Compared to the original TRON, TRON:Legacy is a great modern update and I give it 4 stars for that but, because I like the style and the new direction they are taking the storyline, I'll have to add 1 more star for a total of 5 stars.ne lighting because would you have really paid to see the old look in 3-D?

B005ELZKWS|2.0|I've been listening to this for about a week and 1/2 on about the 4th listening.<br />Trying really hard to like it, just can't do it, some tracks I can't even make it all the way through.<br />I logged on just to see what others were saying about this album. Saw nothing but good reviews, and I was like what???<br />I'm a huge fan of Satch (Since Surfing with the Alien) and Sammy since early '80s,<br />this band has SO MUCH talent, I just can't believe can't do a better album than this. I was a bit disappointed in the first one, but it had a few stand out tracks, ie 'Get It Up', 'Learning to Fall' but this one I just can't get into, maybe I'm the only one.

B002QP145C|5.0|When most people think of the 1939-1940 Winter War between the Soviets and the Finns, they think of outnumbered Finnish troops using guerilla tactics, moving into the forest, cutting off Soviet divisions, splitting them apart, and defeating them in detail.  While this picture is true for the largely undeveloped eastern and northern parts of Finland, in the south, the Finns and Soviets fought a more conventional form of warfare in and near the Mannerheim line.  This movie, \\"Winter War\\", tells the tale of a fictional platoon of reservists that fought in the south, from their initial call-up until the final Finnish acceptance of Soviet terms and end of the war.<br /><br />This movie was produced in Finland and had both a 195 minute theatrical release and was a five part, 265 minute, mini-series shown on Finnish TV.  In the US, it was released as a shortened 125 minute feature.  This DVD edition that I'm reviewing restores the 70 minutes that were cut.  While it's a Korean import, it's subtitled in English.  By and large, the subtitling is excellent, except for the occasional Finnish place-name, where you get some jumbled letters/symbols instead of the place-name.<br /><br />The movie itself is outstanding.  From the use of the tactics from the time, use of actual tanks and aircraft (or replicas) used during the war, and realist depiction of life in the trenches, everything is authentic and believable.  I've seen pictures of the trenches from the Mannerheim line and they look identical to the fighting positions as laid out in the movie.  Most of the action-part of the movie takes place in two locations.  This is a plus, as it affords you the opportunity to become familiar with the fighting positions, and you almost feel that you're there, too, through that familiarity.<br /><br />This move does not hide the brutality or gruesomeness of war.  Several scenes are truly gory, although that was true of the war and the film makers are correct in their decision to show this level of detail.  War is hell, and it would be wrong to \\"pretty it up\\".  In the early part of the movie you get to know the various main characters, and you feel a sense of loss as they get picked off, one after the other.<br /><br />The movie doesn't attempt to give any large lessons about life ... it show the courage (of both sides) and the Finns stubborn pride and willingness to fight for their country, even though they were fighting a country with over 40 times their population.  In the end, they were forced to sign a peace treaty that gave away all in all, 11% of their territory and 30% of the economic assets of pre-war Finland.  But through their efforts, they were able to maintain their independence, unlike the Baltic States who were later forcibly incorporated into Soviet Union.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie to history buffs and students of World War II.  Five stars.nd it would be wrong to \\"pretty it up\\".

B004XNGKBS|2.0|Oh how I wish this app would work.  This is a great idea, using your phone or tablet to write notes instead of having to use old fashioned paper.  Unfortunately though, it works better in theory than in practice.  I'm using a samsung epic phone which has a 4 inch screen.  The process is simply too slow (on a phone anyway) to be used for real world note taking.  The app can only process the words that are on the screen.  If you have a small screen, like on a phone, that means you can only fit one or two words at a time.  And good luck if you have to write a big word because it will not fit.  Instead of the words going on the page as you type, for each word you type, the app has to \\"realize\\" you've finished the word before it puts it on the page for you.  I guess it has to work that way in order to ensure your lines are not crooked, but by the time it's finished doing all of that for each word, you've missed half of the lecture.  It's faster for me simply to use the swype keyboard.  This may be good for someone who doesn't know a qwerty keyboard very well, but for someone who knows how to type, or if you're just good at using your thumbs, it will be much slower if you use this app.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really can not complain, I got it for free. I was hoping it would and it did so I am truly happy. The game is extremely addicting with so much content. I feel like I could play for hours. everyone should definetly get it.
B005O75ZAE|2.0|The content is fine, but I purchased it expecting to be able to download it for offline viewing on my Android tablet (this is why  I use the Amazon MP3 store - easy download and use anywhere).

B003R0MF1W|5.0|I have watched The Mentalist from the beginning and have the DVDs for all three seasons. The character Simon Baker plays (Patrick Jane) is utterly without equal in its depth and breadth. A complete biography of Jane can be constructed from watching the character develop: how he grew up, and how that formed his personality and philosophy of life, why the murder of his wife and daughter affected him so deeply that he could not let go of the need for murderous revenge, how he loved being a husband and father, why he has a two-layered personna - the clever, funny, kind heartedly manipulative, crime solving, no-boundaries CBI consultant on the surface, and the anguished, despairing, heartbroken, insomniac, near-psychotic, celibate (9 years and counting) killer just below it. (And he does kill, deliberately and in cold blood, in the Season 3 finale.) What other TV character can anyone name who is so well drawn? Most of the episodes are extremely well written and insightful. Some seem to be there to stretch out the series because it is such a money-maker, but that can't be helped and doesn't detract from the overall excellence. It's a great morality tale, with some deep philosophy informing it. And all this without the testerone-driven macho behavior, car chases and explosions that make other series so tedious.
B00129H7VS|4.0|In a case of over-hype, I was disappointed on first viewing of this extremely well loved 10 part, 10 hour mini-series. I had been told too many times how incredible it was, and so minor faults became glaring problems and disappointments.<br /><br />Returning to it over 10 years later the positives seem much stronger. By following a platoon from basic training to the end of WW II the series allows for a truly epic sweep. And the characters, while occasionally falling into clich&eacute; are generally extremely well acted, and evolve in believable, complex and sometimes terrifically unpredictable ways.<br /><br />The series is at its best when it feels the most real, putting the audience into the horrors of battle in ways that don't glorify war, death and destruction, even if saluting the bravery and humanity of this small group of men. This is war as brutal, nasty, sudden and arbitrary. Who lives and who dies sometimes has as much to do with dumb luck as bravery or skill. Fear and exhaustion are constant companions. For every good leader who takes care of his men there's a weak one who gets people killed.<br /><br />The device of having the real members of the actual company, now very old, start each episode sharing their memories is a great choice, reminding us that this is no fictional story, but the true tale of very young men doing the best they could in nightmarish circumstances that would humble anyone. When the show first aired some critics were bothered by the fact that it was hard to tell the men apart, and I must admit I had that problem too. But this time around it was far easier. Whether it's just familiarity, or (as I suspect) the advantages of a far bigger, better TV, and high-definition images, suddenly there was much more visual ease in knowing who was who, which made the episodes not only easier to follow, but far more emotional.<br /><br />Not every episode is as strong. Some are truly devastating or deeply enthralling. Others can feel a bit less urgent, a bit unfocused. But even the least are interesting, and have powerful moments. As the two men at the center of it all Damien Lewis and Ron Livingston give excellent, fleshed out performances. But if they seem more focused than some of the other characters that probably has to do with total screen time, and the fact we keep returning to them, then any defects on the part of the others. Overall this is a stirring, human, emotional history lesson and a fitting tribute to those who gave everything they had in 'the good war'.bit unfocused.

B004XNGKBS|3.0|No handwriting/drawing app works well on todays non stylus devices. Fingers do not provide the necessary pinpoint accuracy to make them worthwhile, especially when we have apps that can record our nation more quickly by one touch recording our voices, or even using voice recognition to input text for us.<br /><br />That said, of the apps that do this, Handrite is one of the better ones I've used.  Flip it into landscape mode (does this automatically) and write VERY large, using your while screen for each average length word (maybe 2 - 3 shorter words). The shrink down feature after each occurs quickly enough to make that feature actually useful (maybe not on slower phones).<br /><br />Not optimal, but if you need, our insist upon using this kind of app, this would be a good one to get.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|Well I saw this movie, for one reason.  I am a fan of Captain America. But what a disgrace to the generation that fought and won World War Two. For one, the US ARMY was Segregated in World War Two. There were secret units,ranger, called them commando units if you like,raider units, special operations units in the war like today, but they all were staffed by white soldiers.  Black soldiers unfortunatly were placed in segregated units, mainly in Quartemaster, Transport, and Adminstrative units.  But there were two Division of All Black soldiers that fought in Italy.  They performed well, but were ill served by there white officers. Other units were Artillery, and Armor units that fought above and beyond the call of duty.  It was a big mistake for the army to segregate soldiers, after all we all bleed red.      But Hollywood always misrepresents the facts.  This trends need to stop, because it is like re-writing history that most Americans do not know. As a serving officer, who watched the movie with soldiers all I heard were complaints from all sides. The movie was basically a \\"piece of crap!\\"

0071762345|5.0|If I wasn't actually holding my Kindle in my hand and reading Likeable Social Media, I would swear Dave Kerpen and I were sitting across from each other having a one-on-one conversation about social media.  For at its core, social media is a conversation, and Dave is a great conversationalist. Right from the start, Dave develops a knack of integrating a string of teaching points to keep this \\"how-to\\" book engaging and meaningful for business novices considering social media within their marketing mix.      With mini case studies and business experiences to construct a point, an easy-to-follow landscape emerges allowing readers to immediately develop ideas to apply Dave's wealth of knowledge to their own unique company and industry.  Dave also highlights third-party services and applications to consider and explore to develop more comprehensive campaigns while never overtly providing a hard sell for any single service.  And, while he does weave in a few examples from his own agency, Likeable Media, they are always appropriately placed and relevant as illustrations for driving success and results through social media.  Most importantly, there are ample stops along the way to make notes and ponder ideas with suggested Action Items, Questions to Ask and Guidelines to Follow.  By the end of the book, I had a clear plan to enthusiastically develop a social media outline for my own marketing needs.  In this quickly changing industry, we'll need Likeable Social Media 2.0.  I hope that Dave already has that in the works.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|So I was coming home from work around 11:30 pm or so, I hear this song on the radio and am absolutely blown away.  Turns out to be Deliverance by Opeth, off the album Deliverance(Thank god for technology). Soon to find out, they released an album weeks ago! I've already bought it and it's 2:37 in the morning.  I can't say that I've honestly listened to much if any of their music at all but from what I have heard (via grooveshark)I realize this album is somewhat of a different direction.  I am absolutely blown away!  Jazz meets Prog rock,  I am a fan both so that definitely contributes, but also any melodic metal acts (as far as this themes in this album go). For now I'm going to listen to this album repeatedly because even though it's awesome right now I feel it is only going to grow on you, after that I'm going through their discography. If you've never listened to this band I highly recommend this album; I think it's going to be a real game changer.  Bravo!
B0058WFO06|5.0|Simply amazing with a gathering of world class musicians! If you liked his last few efforts like Incident, Insurgentes and My DNA. You would absolutely love this! I don't know how he does it with all that sruff that he is working on all at the same time with full time touring for the last several years but one thing for sure with Steve he never fails to amaze his fans. Get it or regret not getting it - A true masterpiece and nothing comes close be past or future! I was a bit nervous when he did not have Gavin on this project but fear not. Nic France does a fantastic job and not one time I felt the absence of other regular musicians who's been working with him including Gavin! Get the Album and Enjoy!
B004EPZ00W|5.0|\\"If we win with this team we will have changed the game for good.\\"  After losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs the Oakland A's begin to get picked apart.  After three of thier best players leave from free agency it is up to GM Billy Bean (Pitt) to field a competitive team.  After meeting Peter Brand (Hill) he sees a new way to field a team.  Using modern technology and math instead of scouting to rate players he signs of team of \\"nobodys\\".  Being a huge baseball fan I was very much looking forward to this movie, this movie was even better then I was hoping for.  Written by the writers of \\"Social Network\\" it has roughly the same feel. Watching what a GM goes through on a day by day basis gave me new appreciation for what they do, and to watch Bean struggle with making a team with the lowest payroll in the league to try and compete with teams like the Yankees who have almost 100,000,000 dollars a year more is impressive. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie has nothing to do with the movie itself. Going in I knew enough history about what happened with this team and Beane himself that the tense moments and hard decisions lost some of the effect on me.  But that in no way hurt my enjoyment of the movie, and for those that don't know as much about this it will have the effect it went for.  On a side note Pitt and Hill have the same chemistry that Cloony and Pitt had in the \\"Oceans 11\\" movies and that makes it more fun to watch.  Overall, one of the best movies about sports (not just baseball) I have ever seen.  There is also enough in this that even if you are not a baseball fan you will still really enjoy this. I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutly, I want to buy this.<br /><br />*Also try - Field Of Dreams & The Social Network
0439023513|3.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" was, IMO, the weakest of the three books because it failed to entertain me.  Whereas the previous two books had dark themes and sad moments as well, this book was bogged down with them: slow-paced, depressing, and inactive.  In fact, while I cried at Rue's death in \\"The Hunger Games\\" because its tragedy was well-captured, I found myself unable to cry throughout this last book's more important deaths due to the rapid death tolls and frequent gore.  It was too numbing.  In the previous books, I often had to stop and say \\"I love this book!\\" aloud before continuing because there were so many entertaining or exciting twists and turns.  Even though dark, there was much to enjoy.  In this book, I grimly plowed forward --riveted, no doubt-- because this book does not try to entertain you.  However, this book is also easily the most haunting.  Because of its drastic change in tone and irrevocable character development, I was compelled to reread the series.  Also, I cannot get the story out of my head.  It's only been three days since I finished it but three days of obsession!  I've been pressuring my friends and family to read the first two books but of this one I'm not so sure I can recommend.  It requires fair warning: this one is the least pleasurable, with some narrative flaws of pacing (compared to the well-paced previous books) and too much summation/too little real action.  But it completes the series in a very realistic and thought-provoking way.  So, being warned, do read it!
B005EHNEDO|5.0|Wilco's new album Whole Love is beautiful, it is so great to hear a new creation from Wilco!!  I can hear subtle hints of other late greats in Jeff Tweedy's voice, on this album and I love it!!  Listen as often as you can!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've always heard how good Cut the Rope was, but wow, I didn't think it was this fun and addictive. I had to force myself to stop just so I can do this review. Seeing that I've met my word minimum, I'm going back to play some more. Definitely 5-star worthy. Thanks Amazon.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The actors are stellar. The story lines are superb. The characters are amazing and keep me invested in the show, along with the storyline that keeps me guessing. There is never a dull moment  I was a fan of the original and was worried when I heard about the reboot, because we all know how often those fail. I, initially, watched the show with every intention of picking it apart. Instead I found my new favorite show.   My favorite moments are the 'carguments,' you'll figure out what those are pretty quickly when you start watching. They never cease to make me chuckle.   It's the perfect blend of being character driven and action oriented.
0525425578|3.0|I bought this book without realizing it was intended for young readers.  At 76 I do not qualify.  I read it anyway and Grisham is never really a bad writer.  It is obvious that this is aimed at another audience but I admire his work.  Buy it for your kids if you can convince them that there is a world outside their computer.
B004P7CNUY|5.0|This movie is the perfect horror sequel in every way. It updates the story and characters to a modern setting (or, it was in '98) without dumbing it down too much or succumbing to spoof territory. It has many shocking surprises and twists - and treats for any big fan of the Halloween series.<br /><br />If you love Halloween, this is a must have.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|Excellence is a starting point that never varies in this work.  The descriptions and the plot weave a web that sets not only the tension and desire to know more, it transports you like a time machine to another time and place. I highly recommend this as a must read to enjoy and like a great meal it will nurture you for some time after partaking.
1933952806|5.0|The author does an outstanding job of explaining the cabilities of this very complex camera and how best to take advantage of them.  His simple, down-to-earth style cuts through the technical terminology that can at times be mind-numbing.  A great read and an invaluable resource.  Very well done
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|i gave to say that I was skeptical about the positive reviews.  after playing for about 1 hr, I love this rpg... my favorite one so far. i just wish that you can zoom in when you enter a house... everything is so small. nice incorporation of the tablet system. like ff7 and gem incorporation. kudos
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Needs the option to move to sdcard.Otherwise a great addition to my cameras. Worth the price overall. Gallery option was a must so I'm glad it was updated. Live view of chosen effects is great.
B004TACMZ8|3.0|I would like to start my review by saying that I am not the world's handiest man.  I leave the big jobs to the professionals but I try to do what I can around the house.  I occasionally have to cut into walls (like when mounting a big screen T-V) and I am always afraid of doing something wrong; cutting a wire, running into a stud or a concrete dividing wall when I did not expect to, etc.  When I got a chance to try this item I thought that it would be much better than my current stud-finder.<br /><br />I had a feeling that device was trying to do too much when I saw it's specs and that is still how I feel about it.  I was able to locate the wooden studs (that I knew were in the wall) without much problem.  The other features were hit and miss, especially trying to find electrical wires.  I knew where a pipe full of wires were (an accidental discovery that I made some time back) but the GMS sensor could not find it at first.  Then it did.  Then it was gone.  If I wanted to buy a unit that did what this one is supposed to do, I would look for a different brand.
0553278398|2.0|It was with trepidation I started reading; Asimov wrote it very late in his career when his reputation was such that editors did not cut, but somehow it still had lots of stars on Amazon.  'That's a good sign?' I thought.  But it turns out this book needed those editing cuts.  Badly needed cuts and focus.  My softcover edition weighs in at 434 pages!  That's nearly more than my edition of both actual Foundation books combined.  [[ASIN:0553382578 Foundation (Foundation Novels)]] has 272 pages and [[ASIN:0553382586 Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)]] has 282.  When your prelude in which hardly any events happen is twice as long as 'real' novels, something is wrong.  At 150 pages, this could have been a tight focused introduction to the series, instead Asimov decided even this 'Prelude' wasn't enough and went and wrote a second volume of it -- [[ASIN:0553565079 Forward the Foundation (Foundation Novels)]], his last novel ever.  If you wanted to read about Hari Seldon creating psychohistory, those are the 464 pages it finally happens in.  So what does happen in this novel?  Hari Seldon is introduced as a bright young math student who presents a paper on Trantor, the seat of his galactic empire.  He becomes upset his society is stagnant and primed to fall in a few centuries.  He begins thinking about this and attracts attention.  That's about it for volume one of the 'Prelude'.  The pace of plot movement is glacial, and it took me forever to finish this book.  But finish it I did!  The experience was not worth it, and I do not recommend this book.  As much as I love the Foundation series, I will never re-read this volume, and wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.
B002GHHHL0|5.0|outstanding movie, very full of excitement. Great cast of actors and actress'. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|real fun app. makes time fly and makes you think. I highly recommend it.  nice to have good games in android
B0036T32LQ|5.0|i must say,.. i've seen alot of good horror flick and they all bore me,.. this one kept me guessing every time,.. and even though i saw the ending it still didn't make sense.i won't give it away but remember everything you see,..i loved all the dead bodies. kudos's to the lookalikes. defiantly a must see.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This books is plainly AWESOME! The character that we love never fails to make us think about what we will do if we were the ones sent on a mission and ordered to make an expected standoff scandal go down. I also envy how this military police always gets the hot women in almost all of the collection, yeah you got it right there.<br /><br />This book makes us see past through the man himself, how he got there, his past, family and such and how he loved that toothbrush!Highly recommend it to you and please do read all his other books too!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Brilliant film made by brilliant comedians. That is all you need know.  As for the product I received itself, well, there is a cut on the cover. I don't want to complain too much though...'tis but a scratch.
0062073494|3.0|It was my first time to read this about a week ago, yeah I know I am a loser. Although I know that this is very famous in its own right, still I did not have any idea about it. However, when I read about it I was kinda disappointed about it for I was expecting a LOT from it. Well, its bad enough that the plots goes a little bit dragging for my taste but to think that it is very famous makes it all the more dreadful.   The ending I was hoping for was not there. If you love mysteries and go on reading it for it not be solved that much, it would be FRUSTRATING right? Hmm I hope I made a point here.
014241011X|5.0|a wonderful book. both very cute and pretty funny.  suitable for all ages. i am in my late 20s and I enjoyed it very much. not sure if it's good for kids under 10 due to the somewhat complex vocabulary.
030788743X|4.0|A book for the geeks! And Cline is the the epitome and leader of all the nerds and geeks out there! This book is very informational and scientific all throughout. It makes me nostalgic on how I loved those 80's games that were famous before. Incredibly entertaining and awesome. Every sentence and paragraph makes you want to read more even for those non-gamers and just love reading a nice book. Truly a treasure!
0470913029|5.0|We have been struggling with weight issues all our lives. Now, just by following the guidelines that suggest ways to eat as close as possible to our Paleolithic ancestors, the weight has come off and stayed off: 50lb for my husband and 34lb for me. We are both only 2-3lb from our ideal body weight and keep losing slowly.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is such a great app. I played 75 levels in the first day.  The level design is great and the new ways to get the monster his candy are fun.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|im always telling my friends about this must have alarm clock.  it has really cool features that keep me from oversleeping. i love the feature to solve math problems before you can snooze.  plus the crescendo alarm that starts soft and gets louder over a config time limit will really help you wake up on the right side of bed.  just set it to 30 minute level. and set your alarm to 30 minutes befolre you have to wake up.  now we all go through 30 min deep and ljight cycles when we wake up.  if yur deep aseep when alarm starts you wont wake up and be grumpy rather youll wake up later as yur lighter and alarm gets louder.   hmmm all that make sense? anyway it works for me!
0618871713|5.0|The other reviewers of this book are right: the book rocks. I'll just add that one of the cooler things about this book is how much it's about books, reading, and research. Those might seem like boring themes for a graphic novel, but the way layers of texts and research puzzles take shape in this book makes it an amazingly compelling mystery. This is definitely one of the top 10 graphic narratives I've ever read. It's touching, funny, brilliant, and incredibly interesting. Maybe you're sitting around thinking \\"Man, my family is odd.\\" Forget about it. Read this book if you wanna see a crazy family life!
B0058VW36U|3.0|I played the free holiday version before and was excited to see this one for free.  Unfortunately, the load times are ridiculously long or it crashes.  But when I can play it's a pretty fun puzzler.  Very well done.  Vibrant
B0058VW36U|4.0|great fun. a change of pace from angry birds but, still fun puzzles to solve.<br />I'm still only in the first level.
0525423281|5.0|Ah MY GOD.<br /><br />No, but really. REALLY. Stephanie Perkins is a badass.<br /><br />I loved Anna and the French Kiss on so many levels. I cannot say enough good things about. Which is why I was really, really, really excited to pick up a copy of Lola and the Boy Next Door at BEA. SO excited. I almost cried and hugged the Penguin publicist.<br /><br />And it totally lived up to my expectations. Lola and the Boy Next Door is damn good - just as good as Anna and the French Kiss. I mean jumping up and down good.<br /><br />Let's talk about the CHARACTERS. Because Stephanie Perkins writes some badass characters. Lola is great. She's so different than Anna and spazzy and original and artsy and creative and so utterly relatable in a way that only Stephanie Perkins' characters can be. I know some people like Lola more than Anna and I can see why, but Anna is me in literary form and therefore she automatically wins. But Lola still rocks and it's so much fun to be immersed in her book.<br /><br />And Cricket! You guys have already heard a lot about Cricket but CRICKET! There's really nothing I can say that you'll understand until you read the book other than CRICKET!<br /><br />And Lola's two dads - I have so much love for diverse family relationships and I love reading about them and I love Stephanie Perkins for helping to create Lola's character in such a complex way that involves these two dads who are so awesomely real themselves and I just....gah. All of the characters in Lola and the Boy Next Door are basically awesome.<br /><br />Honestly, if you haven't read Anna and the French Kiss, you need to do it like, last year. When it came out. And you need to read Lola and the Boy Next Door when it hits shelves this month. Because Stephanie Perkins is definitely one of my favourite authors ever. After TWO BOOKS. I mean, really. Go read these books!
0920668372|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the finest children's books ever written!  It was one of our soon-to-be 16 year old grandaughter's favorites during storytime in the evening before she went to sleep.
B005C5A66G|2.0|Been a long fan of this band, but for this album except for the song \\"Locust\\", it's not really spectacular.this album seems like their trying to go a little commercial again...Maybe they want to get girls or feel they are going to make more $$ playing softer songs..I dont know, but I like their last two albums better then this one..and of course \\"Burn my Eyes\\" is a classic..
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|All the stock screensavers on my Windows computer were pretty awful. They were short and too simple (flying through the stars is so 90s). This 'Tree of Life' screensaver really does the trick. It's pretty entertaining, sometimes I don't even want to move the mouse! I'm not sure why it's described as a 'movie' though... No more flying toasters for me!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I am very disappointed with this mini series. It is garbage compared to Band of Brothers.   There is no actual testimonies of veterans fighting in the pacific as there was in Band of Brothers. This lack of testimonies makes it feel like this is a realistic fiction TV show instead of the real life anecdotes of American Heroes. There is no clear relation between the different characters, the use of profanity is excessive and mostly unnecessary and the sex scenes are way too many and irrelevant to the plot. Men in full frontal nudity, sex in every disc! OUTRAGEOUS!  This series was made just for profit, no real story to tell, no connection with or between the characters, boring.  DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|As a lifelong Janeite, I have read Ms. Austen's books countless times. I have also tried to make it a point to get my hands on any Austen production (and to a larger extent, Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian drama.) Unfortunately, the only \\"Emma\\" I have yet to see is the Kate Beckinsale version - but I have seen the 1972 BBC, the 1996 Paltrow, and now the 2009 version.  If you took a poll of a number of Austen fans, most would probably say that Elizabeth Bennet is their favorite heroine. I love ALL the heroines (including the much neglected Fanny Price) but were I to choose a favorite, it would certainly be Miss Emma Woodhouse. Of course Jane Austen predicted that hardly anybody would like such a character as Emma except herself, but it is to Ms. Austen's credit how Emma Woodhouse grows and evolves from the beginning to the end. I find it hard to believe that people would harbor any dislike for Emma once the story wraps up - she's an amazing character, and among Jane Austen's most complex creations.   Before the BBC came out with this production, I admit that MY Emma was the Jeremy Northam/Gwyneth Paltrow 1996 movie. It was still my version of Emma even after I saw this version for the first couple times. I thought, at first, that this Emma was a good adaptation but the 1996 one was better. But it grew on me, and quickly too. It has now become a period drama I love and adore and I consider it the version of Emma I love best.   Of course, comparing the two productions would be like comparing lemons to limes - one being a 2 hour movie, the other a 4 hour miniseries. They are both good in their own right, but I hope this may be a little insight as to why I believe this version of Emma is worth purchasing (as well.)   The Paltrow movie uses lines directly from Austen's book, and the atmosphere does reflect the world of the book nicely. The 2009 version, while capturing the essence of the book as a whole (and being faithful, in large part, to the book) does not utilize Jane Austen's witty lines as often as its predecessor. Instead, screenwriter Sandy Welch uses some of her own words to tell the story. It is no question that Austen will always trump anybody's own original words, but Sandy's script is still a good one. I am usually not one to condone liberties when it comes to transferring a book to the screen (especially when it comes to something I love, like Austen). In fact, most of the time my insides tend to boil like hot water in a tea kettle at the thought of a period production going ever-so-slightly off book (I'm looking at you, [[ASIN:B004XVMCMQ Mansfield Park (1999)]]). But I can forgive Sandy Welch (who has written such beautiful productions such as [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre]] and [[ASIN:B000AYEL6U North & South]]) because while it may not be Austen's words verbatim, Sandy brings Emma to life.  The locations and costumes of 2009 Emma are a visual delight! Almost every scene is like a Georgian era oil painting. It is all so beautiful.   As to the actors - both productions have a wonderful cast. Jeremy Northam was always my Mr. Knightley, and he still has that title, but now he shares it with Jonny Lee Miller. I associated Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram in that horribly disappointing adaptation of Mansfield Park. He wasn't bad in that movie...but I was nervous because this was EDMUND - somebody already in the Austen canon. But I had no reason to be since Mr. Miller was a FANTASTIC Knightley. He brings a slightly different approach to the character than Northam, but you will still sigh with happiness by the end of the fourth episode. To me, Romola Garai is the perfect Emma. Gwyneth's Emma was a refined, spoiled, snobbish, manipulative young woman. With Romola's portrayal you still have a spoiled young girl whose meddlesome matchmaking ways make the people of Highbury her playthings. However, she matches her friends with the best of intentions - she befriends and counsels Harriet Smith in good faith; she, unlike Gwyneth's Emma, does not look down upon Harriet. Moreover, the scene at Box Hill in which Emma makes a remark against Miss Bates is how I viewed her action best. You could sense a bit of malice in Paltrow's Emma, whereas I feel Romola's said it out of lack of tact, which is how I understood it in the book. However annoying Miss Bates could get, Emma did not hate her and I feel she was genuinely sorry for what she said. Michael Gambon made me love Mr. Woodhouse - he was by far my favorite character in this series. He was as described: a gentle tyrant. And he is laugh-out-loud hilarious. He definitely deserved the Emmy nomination. The rest of the cast are very good from Louise Dylan playing the sweet but simple Harriet to Christina Cole as the annoying Mrs. Elton, and Blake Ritson as the arrogant and pompous Mr. Elton.    This DVD is marvelous in and of itself. The case is hard (it almost feels as if it were a book) with a gorgeous design. The inside is just as gorgeous with a beautiful image of Romola Garai on both discs, and a picture of the Box Hill picnic lining the inside of the case. The features are also very interesting! You will not regret buying this series!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I cant stop listening to this cd!!  I cant stop singing the songs!!  This is much better than my expectations.. The packaging is awesome.. If you are considering buying this, get the cd instead of mp3 download because it is worth it.. I spent an hour messing with the booklet and 3d glasses.. A must for true rock fans!!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is well worth the $3 so naturally anyone who doesn't already have it should jump on the opportunity to have it for free.  i have well over 20 hours played and continue to play.

B005G4TJI4|5.0|I love Amazon.com but this is $2 cheaper at Best Buy!  Check your local newspaper ads for this weekend.  Amazing movie as we saw it in Imax 3-D so I expect another version to be released at a future date.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I've just finished The Night Circus, and thought it magical. I first only downloaded the sample and was instantly hooked and purchased it.  The idea behind this story is so unique.  She does an amazing job creating a world and allowing you, as the reader, to feel as if you're apart of the whole thing.  My only complaint was I had somewhat of a hard time following the time line.  It skipped around and although the chapters had dates on them, I often wasn't following and would have to go back and look at the date. Other than that this story was amazing, definitely unique. Worth the 12.99 spent.
B005D51JQQ|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down to Sting over the years, his classics have never lost their luster. When it has came down to his classics during his days with The Police on songs like Message In A Bottle or the definitive Every Breath You Take, his solo breakout with driven and intimate songs like The Soul Cages and If You Love Somebody Set Them Free, his classics still stand strong just as much today, as when they came out back in the 70's, 80's and 90's and beyond. But for his solo works, they have just been classics and bring out a deep intimacy from every song he had ever wrote. But, there hasn't been a definitive reflection of Sting's classics of his solo era. There have been some good ones, and with his Police era, but not on his own. Now, to celebrate his 60th birthday, Sting has re-issued a lot of his classics to celebrate his 25th anniversary of his solo era to a whole new generation of fans. But is it worth the money, yes and no.<br /><br />Sting: 25 Years is a 3 CD set and DVD set of Sting's classics from his solo era from each and every album since 1985's The Dream Of The Blue Turtles, to his 2010 album Symphonicities. None of his works from his days with The Police are on this collection at all. The cavalcade of songs handle very well, and include a lot of classics from his solo work including the definitive If I Ever Lose My Faith In You, Be Still My Beating Heart, All This Time, and the driven Desert Rose. The collection of songs also includes tracks that haven't yet been on a Sting hits collection including the tropical Love Is The Seventh Wave, The Soul Cages, and It's Probably Me from Ten Summoner's Tales. As a collection, it mostly holds out well, but there were a few great songs that were overlooked from this collection. The big overshadowed example is original recording of Russians from 1985's The Dream Of The Blue Turtles. Instead of the intimate original version, the version of his 2010 Symphonicities was highlighted. There were also a lot of other classics that weren't included here including Let You Soul Be Your Pilot from Mercury Falling, the original version of Send Your Love instead of the dance version, and some of Sting's movie songs like All For Love with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams to name a few.<br /><br />Still, despite a few flaws, and overpriced in value, Sting: 25 Years mostly handles well as a great buy for die hard devoted Sting fans, as well as for anyone whom is new to his work. Yet, I honestly thoguh wish it could've been a bit less in value for what it is worth. Nevertheless, Sting's 25 Years handles well with what the effort Sting had made into making a nice collection of his works. If you love his music, set it free again.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: C 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B-ot of other classics that weren't included here including Let You Soul Be Your Pilot from Mercury Falling, the original version of Send Your Love instead of the dance version, and some of Sting's movie songs like All For Love with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams to name a few.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|Wait, why are you all so suprised? Mikael's own idea of death metal has lost it's depth and meaning a long time ago (After 'My arms, your hearse' & 'Still Life'to be exact..wait wait, you don't know about these albums? Shame on YOU!) and he's been interested in being some Caravan, Camel copycat group ever since 'Blackwater Park'. 'Heritage' is the result.<br />Opeth as a whole lost it's stability and effort to be the triumphant death metal they once were, unique in it's own way too. The 'Orchid' album had rustic baroque influences entwined with raw death without the need of roadrunner runner records breathing down their throats! 'Morningrise' is Opeth's masterpiece, a musically exhilirating album that gave Opeth it's unique form,and is now a lost forest with no trail. What happened to the bass?? Bring DeFarfalla back! and Isberg!!! Lot's of you are new Opeth fans that never gave the older albums much of a chance. Mikael needs to rethink his idea of genuine death metal and fire once again his fellow members. Figured it went all to hell after Lindgren, the last true Opeth member, also left. I don't see the originality nor the Purity that the Opeth I once listened to had.Formulaic music videos and corporate-mongers roadrunner won't help you either, Mikael..
B0058S0OMS|5.0|This Blu Ray is well worth the price and then some.<br />Besides the film itself being an 80's classic and worthy sequel to Halloween.<br />It has the documentary &#34;Terror In The Aisles&#34; which you can only get on VHS in it's entirety also in Blu Ray,that was huge for me.The transfer of the Film itself is really good as well as the sound being awesome.<br />I say it's a gift from the Horror Gods.

0307346617|5.0|I did not expect much from this book, but all of the high reviews were correct. To put it simply this book is entertaining. For me it was more of a social commentary of the inept government and corporate response to a problem (in this case zombies). Written in a narrative form, the stories are generally short and well written. Great reading if you have just a few minutes or an extended reading time. Be warned once you get a few stories into it, it is hard to put down.

0553807919|5.0|I couldn't wait to for \\"the Whole Brain Child\\" to arrive so that I could start reading it. Let me say that it is packed with lots of information and after reading it, I must admit, I need to reread over and over again. It contains 12 whole-brain strategies that are explained in details & offers a few simple illustrations.<br /><br />I like the concept of integrating both the left and right side of the brain. There are more and more products these days geared towards Right brain or Left brain learning such as Tweedlewink. I'm excited to see more and more research done on this subject that can help us understand how our brains work and how to teach and communicate to our children more effectively. \\"Instead of just giving the answer...excercise the upstairs brain.\\" With this book you get advice on how you can help your children produce these characteristics:<br /><br />- sound decision making and planning<br />- control over emotions and body<br />- Self-understanding<br />- Empathy<br />- Morality<br /><br />I like how \\"The Whole Brain Child\\" at the end of the book reviews the type of integration, whole brain strategy and application strategy according to the age group you are seeking as a \\"refrigerator sheet\\". Overall, a very insightful book.

Well... things are fine if you don't count the fact  that her dads don't approve of her 22-year-old boyfriend.  Then, the Bell twins move back in next door and her birth mother shows up, and Lola's life gets turned upside down.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I absolutely loved Anna and the French Kiss, so I was super-excited to read Lola and the Boy Next Door;  Ms. Perkins writing shines again in this wonderful story of love lost and found anew.<br /><br />Lola is a sweet kid with a style all her own - wigs, glitter, dresses made from tablecloths.  She works in a local movie theatre (with Anna from Anna and the French Kiss), hangs out with her best friend Lindsey, and sees her boyfriend Max as often as her fathers will let her.  When the Bell twins move back in, she's devastated.  Calliope Bell is just a witch, and her twin brother Cricket Bell was Lola's True Love.  Then, right before they moved away, something happened between them.  It took Lola a long time to get over the hurt, so when he moves back in, she's determined not to let him get under her skin.

Now my butt feels COLOSSAL.  Maybe he's looking at my legs.  Is that better?  Or worse?  Do I want him looking at me?  I hold on to the bottom of my dress as I climb into the backseat and crawl to the other side.  I'm sure he's looking at my butt.  He has to be.  It's huge, and it's right there, and it's huge.<br />  No. I'm acting crazy.<br />  I glance over, and he smiles at me as he buckles his seat belt.

B0058A119G|5.0|This is a great collection of former and new Streisand renditions.  All in all it makes for great listening!  The notes included and the extra CD were most welcome, also.
B00507ZQVQ|3.0|The main leads are so overweight they can hardly move. On CD it is not a problem but on Blu-ray it just looks ridicuous. The whole thing is far too static and the grand march looks tired. The ballet does not look at all like anything that might have come from ancient Egypt. I will not bother to watch it again. Aida really needs a new recording.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|What can I say that wasn't been said by everyone else? Nothing really. The G155 is awesome and it exceeded my expectations. Before I found this mobile system I was looking at the HORI monitor, but after seeing that baby online I was sold. What I love about it is the fact the console stays cool over an extended period of time, its thoroughly protected by the case, and the 15\\" screen it built in into the case. The two accessory bags complement the package. Their the right size to hold all of the power cables in one bag and at least one ps3 controller(I haven't tried to put two in the same bag) plus the charge cable for the controller. All I got to say is great job making an excellent mobile gaming system GAEMS. I love the G155 and to quote my college professor, \\"Life is Good!\\"   After I receive the rest of my pell grant money, I plan on getting a car inverter and run either 2 or 4-AWG wire in my car. Once everything is hooked up, I will update my review and also provide some pictures of gaming on the road. Because of the price I'm leaning towards getting the Cobra CPI 880 800 Watt Power Inverter, but I'm also considering the Power Bright PW1100-12 Power Inverter. After reading a response from John Smith, one of GAEMS co-founder, I agree with going all out overkill. If I'm going to install this setup in my car, why not join the master of overkill and get an inverter will handle the power demands of everything when its fired up.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Lady Antebellum has done it again! Yet another amazing album with \\"Own the Night.\\" I love that Charles, Hillary, and Dave pen the vast majority of their songs, making them so personal and easily relatable. Lady A truly cares about their music and their fans! Being a Lady A'er myself, I definitely feel the love from the trio by way of their social media sites and their live concerts! The most recent concert I attended was on Sept 15, 2011 at the Troubadour for a super intimate \\"unplugged\\" show to celebrate the release of \\"Own the Night.\\" I'm so happy to have Lady A's music in my life, and strongly encourage everyone to purchase their 3rd album! As well as their first two albums if you haven't purchased them already! Cheers to Lady A!!! Let's remember to \\"Own the Night!\\"
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I love Chickenfoot.  Since their inception I've been a fan.  The first album was a great rock album, but with III they Foot has hit a home run! It totally rocks! What I really noticed about this album was how much tighter of a band these guys have become.  They've gotten to know each other and they've really stepped it up lyrically and musically from the last album.  Not saying the first wasn't amazing but III shows a greater unity.  So, why should you buy this album?  First, how can you go wrong with the awesome vocals of Sammy Hagar, the brilliant guitar work of Joe Satriani, the thumping bass of Michael Anthony, and the hard-hitting drumbeats of Chad Smith? You can't, pure and simple!   The second reason? The great musicianship and songwriting abilities of Sammy, Joe, Mike, and Chad.  These guys are masters of their craft. The vocals are perfect, with Michael Anthony's backing vocals brought out more.  Joe has written some great guitar parts and Chad and Mike have done wonders with the rhythm section.  The lyrical content of this album has taken a more somber tone, especially on tracks like \\"Different Devil\\" and \\"Three and a Half Letters.\\" The latter is an awesome song, although I was skeptical at first when I'd first learned about it.  But, it works and it is terrific!  You'll know what I'm talking about when you give it a listen.  When Sammy came out saying that the second album would be called III, I thought he was jumping the gun.  I thought that maybe he was being a little egotistical (he was).  But rightly so because III is worthy of its title! This album will rock you from top to bottom!  Some of my stand out tracks are: \\"Alright, Alright\\"--a rockin' song with a great chorus, you will catch yourself air guitaring and air drumming! \\"Different Devil\\"--A slower track, but the lyrics are awesome and so are the instrumentals. \\"Big Foot\\"--If you've heard this first single and weren't sold instantly, you need to take a listen again. It's a great song! \\"Three anda Half Letters\\"--It's a different kind of song, with mostly spoken word but it's VERY powerful. \\"Something Gone Wrong\\"--One of the best tracks on this album, it has a really interesting feel at the beginning!  I honestly think anyone would be crazy not to give this album a listen.  I love that these classic artists are still around.  As a 19 year old I missed all of these guys' heydays but I'm glad I have the opportunity to hear new music from these old artists! With their first album in 2009 to this one, I hope these guys stay around as Chickenfoot for a LONG time!   While you're in a CD buying mood, you should also check out Sebastian Bach's \\"Kicking & Screaming,\\" the Red Hot Chili Peppers' (of which Chickenfoot drummer Chad Smith is drummer)\\"I'm With You,\\" and Night Ranger's \\"Somewhere in California.\\"  Keep the faith my friends and happy listening!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is one of the best fm transmitter mp3 player you can buy.  And at 40 bucks, its a great deal.  Most reviews say that it sees 1999 songs and 99 folders, but I have more that 2300 songs (in alphabetical folders) on a 16 gb memory card (the memory isn't full) and it sees all of them, so if you have a 32 gb card and most of your songs are small files (~4 mb each) then you could have maybe 8 to 10 thousand songs on one memory card.  You could listen forever and never hear the same song twice.
1400052173|4.0|I remember reading about Henrietta Lacks 25 years ago. I think it must have been in the pages of Science 83 (84, 85, etc.) and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it were in an article by Michael Gold, who wrote [[ASIN:0887060994 A Conspiracy of Cells: One Woman's Immortal Legacy and the Medical Scandal It Caused]] on the subject. So this story is nothing new. The author has done a good job of telling it and popularizing it, though. I see this book everywhere, and far more laymen will have heard of HeLa because of this book than picked up on the story in the 1980s.
193355021X|5.0|Ignorance drives the public discussion on economics in the press, on TV, in homes and coffee shops and, because of this ignorance, confusion results.  Our elected representatives, backed by powerful entities, exploit this confusion for their own advantage.  This book, written in 1962 by Henry Hazlitt, educates the reader with sound, time-tested economic truths.  It refutes those arguments put forth by special interests whose objective is merely to advance their own financial advantage over their competition, not to advance the truth about economic activity.  \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" is written to the common man, it is not technical and dry as are academic style texts that are written on this subject.  Hazlitt distills a complex subject into basic principles which anyone who manages a household's expenses can understand.  I recommend this book as a \\"must read\\" for everyone who votes.  A vote cast for a politician who promises economic prosperity based on a FLAWED understanding of \\"cause and effect\\", is a wasted vote and produces disappointing results for us all.
0525423281|4.0|Like most of you, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of Stephanie Perkins' sophomore novel for months and months now. My copy arrived on my doorstep Friday afternoon and I carried it around in my purse the rest of the day, just in case I had a chance to start it. Sadly, I did not. But that only meant I got to curl up that night with it and read it straight through from cover to cover in one sitting. In all honesty, that wasn't actually my original intention, as sleep and I have not been as one lately as I would like us to be, and I was really hoping for some Zs. But. It was not to be. I couldn't sleep. And Lola was so madcap and charming. Put the two together and there really wasn't any way I was putting it down at all. So I toddled off to bed somewhere around 4 AM, exhausted but grinning ear to ear. I love this cover, too. Much more than the cover of [[ASIN:0142419400 Anna and the French Kiss]]. I liked the title on the park bench and the Eiffel Tower and all, but neither person on that one looked anything like Anna or &Eacute;tienne to me. On the other hand, this is very much how I picture Lola. On a low key day, of course. And curvier, naturally. And while the dude isn't quite eccentric enough to be Cricket, he's certainly not too shabby to look at. I do love, though, how both covers have been set, if you will, in pivotal places in their stories. Don't think for a minute I don't notice (and appreciate it) when you get things right, Cover Gods. Because I do.<br /><br />Lola Nolan asks for very little in life. Just the freedom to dress up in a different costume (complete with wig, false eyelashes, matching nails, and combat boots) every day of the week. The freedom to date her significantly older rocker boyfriend without mountains of judgement raining down on her head from her disapproving parents. And the freedom to never, ever have to see the Bell twins again. Unfortunately, the stars are not aligning in Lola's favor. She can't figure out how to fabricate a key element of her fabulous Marie Antoinette costume she's been planning to wear to the winter formal forever. Her dads appear to be on a set course to disapprove of her boyfriend Max for the foreseeable future. And the Bell family has just moved back in next door, thereby completing the Trifecta of Terror in Lolaland. And to add insult to injury, Cricket Bell (the male half of the Bell twins) appears to remember everything--every last horridly embarrassing detail from the last time they saw each other several years ago now. Not only that, but he seems bent on addressing their history, if you will, in wholly unforeseen and unwelcome ways. Then there's his ever-caustic sister Calliope, with her perfect life and her perfect disdain for all things Lola. And before long, it's like Lola can't do anything right. No matter how hard she tries, everything is falling apart at the seams she's worked so hard to stitch tight.<br /><br />Too much fun, that's what Stephanie Perkins books are. Just a handful of pages, a little orientation on people, place, and hair color, and I am settled in with my bowl of popcorn and a sloppy grin plastered on my face. Lola is very different from Anna. She's all about appearances and entrances and carefully orchestrated moments. And because of a few key devastating experiences in her past, she's far less confident in her own skin. But she has style oozing out of every pore. And she has a good heart, which she'd prefer not to get crushed ever again, thank you very much. And so she is blind to a few rather important things, such as how her peers actually perceive her, the true state of her relationship with Max, and the kind of lengths she wants to go to to preserve the image she projects. Despite her blindness and her continual emotional missteps, I cared about Lola. I wanted her to come to see things clearly. And I wanted to be there when she did. Fortunately, the journey to clarity is a hilarious and moving one here. Stephanie Perkins excels at dialogue and at the wonderful observations Lola makes on those around her. Witness the introduction of Cricket Bell:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"I called your name.\\" He tries to stop smiling, but his mouth only opens wider with delight. I can practically count his teeth. \\"I called it a dozen times, but your music was too loud, so I was waiting it out. You're a good dancer.\\"<br /><br />Mortification strips me of the ability to engage in intelligent conversation.<br /><br />\\"I'm sorry.\\" His grin hasn't disappeared, but he visibly squirms. \\"I only wanted to say hello.\\"<br /><br />He swings his legs back inside of his bedroom in one fluid motion. There's a lightness to the way he lands on his feet, a certain grace, that's instantly recognizable. It washes me in a familiar aching shame. And then he stretches, and I'm stunned anew.<br /><br />\\"Cricket, you're . . . tall.\\"<br /><br />Which is, quite possibly, the stupidest thing I could say to him.<br /><br />Cricket Bell was always taller than most boys, but in the last two years, he's added half a foot. At least. His slender body--once skinny and awkward, despite his graceful movements--has also changed. He's filled out, though just slightly. The edge has been removed. But pointing out that someone is tall is like pointing out the weather when it's raining. Both obvious and irritating.<br /><br />\\"It's the hair,\\" he says with a straight face.\\"Gravity has always been my nemesis.\\"<br /><br />And his dark hair is tall. It's floppy, but . . . inverted floppy. I'm not sure how it's possible without serious quantities of mousse or gel, but even when he was a kid, Cricket's hair stood straight up. It gives him the air of a mad scientist, which actually isn't that far off. His hair is one of the things I always liked about him.<br /><br />Until I didn't like him at all, that is.<br /><br />***<br /><br />She knows how to introduce a character, doesn't she? And this particular one is an absolute highlight of the book. Cricket Bell stole my heart and tucked it away in his pocket along with a few mechanical bits and bobs and a candy wrapper or two. Again with the nice guys! It's like Stephanie Perkins is their champion or something. But Cricket is something special. Unfathomably tall, always in motion, he jerks his way through the novel with utterly disarming charm. From his pinstripe pants to his indefatigable hair, the boy tugged at my heartstrings every time he opened his mouth. Which brings us to my favorite thing about Stephanie Perkins' brand of romance. I am most riveted, most in love, when these two are simply talking to each other. It's those quiet scenes where their hearts are laid bare and there's nothing but words between them, and inside each of those words is an entire world, that kill me. My heart squeezes just thinking about it now. Happily, there are also a couple little scenes between Anna and St. Clair as well. They are secondary characters in this one, but let's face it--St. Clair has a hard time being secondary to anything. I delighted in the scenes they shared with Lola and Cricket. Every one of them made me want to re-read [[ASIN:0142419400 Anna and the French Kiss]] immediately upon finishing this one. While San Francisco didn't manage to have the wonderful ambiance of Paris, and while I may have questioned Lola a bit for persisting in a couple of her emotional missteps for quite as long as she did, she, like Anna, felt real to me. And she felt well-meaning. As though she knew she was making mistakes right and left but was helpless to stop them somehow. Haven't we all felt that way before? Especially when in the death grip of our insecurities. And there's nothing to do but try to mend things the best we can once we do get a hold of ourselves. Such is the case here. I loved how bold and colorful Lola is. And I loved how reticent Cricket is, all the while wearing his enormous heart on his sleeve. I tell you it's a sort of exquisite agony watching Lola and Cricket sit in their windows and do battle with what lies between them. Oh, the longing.

0517543052|5.0|I first of all would like to say thank you for selling this not so easy to find book (Remember, Be Here Now By Ram Dass.) I purchased two; one for myself and one to give away. It is a great read for anyone. Also, I am very pleased with the service!
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I bought this board in preparation for the BullDozer CPUs (I use it with a Phenom II X4 at the moment) and mainly because I have two GPUS (previously on an MSI micro-atx board) this full ATX board gives my GPUs much more air to breathe.<br />I will say however, there is a flaw with this board. The bios are very basic (even the updated ones), Asus bios are much better (even my previous MSI bios were more in depth).<br /><br />Ram can be overclocked to 1600mhz if you have a processor that doesn't natively support it (Phenom II) and it works fine on this board.<br /><br />Other than that, the CPU was easy to install, there are a lot of SATA ports, and both PCI-E X16 ports run at a full 16X instead of many that run at 8X and 8X with two GPUs.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|We love horror movies.  This isn't a horror film.  This is just a snuff film.  Yes, they are actors that didn't actually die, but this is horrible.  REVOLTING!!  It's just a film for rapists and pedophiles to get off to without getting arrested.  Not worth watching if it were free!!  Not worth watching if they paid you!!  Wes Craven's worst work.  Worst movie we've ever seen.  I feel sorry for the actors who were so desperate for money.  If I could, I would give it negative stars.
0525423281|3.0|If you loved Anna and the French Kiss, this review is NOT for you; go read Lola already, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />To further explain my title: I know a lot of people LOVED Perkins' first book Anna and the French Kiss but I did not. Still I gave her second book a chance because people were raving about it again. Yet I liked this one even less than Anna. Read on for my specific problems.<br /><br />I mostly liked Anna and the French Kiss with some qualms (mainly that St. Clair is super short, which is reiterated in this book and it may be shallow but I like guys who are taller than me; and the fact that St. Clair CHEATED on his girlfriend to be with Anna-yeah they only kissed at the end but there was serious emotional unfaithfulness going on way before then and I will never stop mentioning that because I've yet to see anyone else mention it and it really bothers me).<br /><br />But I LOVED Perkins' writing so I jumped at the chance to read this book early despite knowing that the main characters were called Lola and Cricket; Lola is a nickname but Cricket is apparently his real name which makes me think that his parents were on something. Additionally his twin sister is named Calliope, which is rather out-there although less worrying. A Greek muse is clearly a better namesake than a bug. I can appreciate unique names in YA and I hate when character names run together (I read two books where the main characters were Emily and Emma and I kept confusing them in my mind) but they don't need to go that far, IMO.<br /><br />Anyway Lola is the main character and she loves costumes; quite frankly, it sounded like she dressed like Claudia from the Baby-Sitters Club: absolutely cracked-out crazy. And while I admired her sewing abilities, she was a ditz who could be out of it for days when the boys in her life confused her. She is also a character who feels that lying is the best solution for her problems (that seems to be cropping up a lot in the YA books I read). So I wasn't a big fan of Lola.<br /><br />Then we have her boyfriend Max, a guitarist who is 22 to Lola's just turned 17. Because of the age difference, her dads require the two to have Sunday brunch, an early curfew, and hourly check-ins when they're on a date. Although Max isn't to my taste (he drinks, which is legal but I'm a teetotaler; smokes pot and possibly also cigarettes, which illegal for the former and super smelly for both!), he seemed like a mostly cool guy. The age difference at that particular point in life is kind of weird but they seemed to have a connection and to be working on building a solid foundation for a future.<br /><br />However there is the complication of \\"the boy next door,\\" the aforementioned Cricket, who had a chance with Lola but screwed it up big time. She has decided to hate him forever except that he's really cute, states quite clearly that he does like her and always has, and her dads love him. Thus we have the typical YA hate of a girl for a practically perfect boy who she clearly adores and who tries to fight her attraction for way too long.<br /><br />Beyond the romance, there is also Lola's family situation. She lives with her dads, technically her uncle and his partner, as her mom, Norah, became pregnant but was drug-addled and unstable. Norah is still occasionally part of Lola's life, causing embarrassment and hurt feelings whenever she appears. Lola's dads are pretty great though, if overprotective and a little too interfering with her life. I think it's fine to disapprove of your daughter's boyfriend, especially when he could have already graduated college while she's still in high school; less cool to invite a boy she used to have a crush on but who broke her heart on a surprise \\"family\\" outing with absolutely no consideration of Lola's feelings.<br /><br />Something that most early reviewers seemed to have liked was the reappearance of St. Clair and Anna. As someone who doesn't really like St. Clair, I found their together ALL THE TIME coupleness kind of disgusting (they seem to spend all of their time together or traveling to be together). I'm usually a much more optimistic romantic but this couple just pisses me off.<br /><br />By the end of the book, there were some swoony scenes...except that I didn't like Lola or Cricket so I didn't care. Additionally, I didn't feel like the writing was as strong in this book. More scenes felt contrived and the San Francisco background didn't come to life like Paris did. The humor was also lacking.<br /><br />Overall-<br />What I liked: Lola's dads; Max until he was demonized so that it was okay for Lola to choose Cricket; Norah, who ended up having touching insight.<br /><br />What I didn't like: Lola--and almost every decision she made; Cricket's name<br /><br />Cover: I hate people staring at me from the cover and the guy is only okay looking.

B0034G4P80|5.0|Released in 2011, &#34;Thor&#34; is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.<br /><br />The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).<br /><br />THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the &#34;Allfather&#34; is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.<br /><br />You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse?<br /><br />Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Kind of addicting, really. My two year old son loves this because of the cute sounds and graphics and because he can figure out basic play. I like to go along behind and figure out the physics of each level. Easy enough not to be frustrating, challenging enough not to be boring.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I had a nosebleed seat at the clevalnd show so I cant wait to see it close with the real sound that makes this band the most incredible trio in rock ever. I first saw them at the tommorrow club in youngstown ohio which was an old movie theater converted to a rock club on the farewell to kings tour in 1977.  They blew the place away then. Every time I drive by that theater which is torn down except for the historical facade I remember how they rocked that place.  Each part of this band is so incredible and unique on its own and we are lucky they are still around.   AND THE MAPLES FORMED A UNION - I didnt know they had unions in canada?
B0057GYOA4|5.0|Nirvana's reissued of Nirvana's Nevermind is incredible. One of the best records ever made. The remastered sound jumps out of your headphones.
B0058VW36U|1.0|The game loads and I can get to the level select screen but I can get any of the levels to load. This app is useless to me if I cannot play the game! I am glad I didn't spend money to get it, it was the free app of the day. Uninstalled.
0765322889|1.0|This was a surprisingly painful read, and it certainly isn't my first foray into the genre. The good points: a creative approach to magic and a FEW well-defined characters (once you get past the ridiculous names). The emphasis exists because I didn't feel as though I knew ANY of them until about 300 pages into the story. We're told people want things and love things that bluntly contradict their supposed motives. No explanations are offered. Even at the end of the book I couldn't tell you much about Whiskeyjack. Sure, he used to be an army bigshot and is now a grizzled old sergeant, but nothing exists outside of that tired cliche. What does he look like? What does he really care about? I have no idea and I really don't care much by the book's end. And the book is bursting at the seams with characters. They're arriving in great piles and bunches, right up to the final 30 pages of the story. How to sort them all out? Who should we care about? I have no clue.   Erikson really has some good ideas, but his command of the language seems inadequate to tell his story. His sentence structure is frequently arcane and the metaphors became awkward so often that I found myself walking away in frustration more than once. The book really has potential but suffers from a surfeit of undeveloped themes. It needed a more involved editor that was willing to cut huge portions and send the author back to the drawing board. There's enough material in here for 3 books, if all of the relationships and subplots were adequately explored. As it is, things fly by so quickly that the reader never gets the chance to care about any of the places or people involved.   TL, DR: Over-hyped mess with a few good ideas but no follow-through. Skip it.
B003777QYQ|4.0|On Writing is half memoir, half \\"how writing works for me\\".  The memoir part was somewhat amusing, I guess.  Other than being an insanely popular (and in my opinion very good) writer, though, Stephen King actually had a fairly normal life, so the memoir part didn't really excite me all that much.  This isn't to say anything bad about King - my life is pretty normal too, and I suspect it would make for an awful memoir - but it's not all that gripping to read about his fairly ordinary childhood.  The memoir parts on his novels (notably Carrie are somewhat more interesting, but don't take up a huge portion of the book.  The parts on writing are decent.  To start with, I like that King preferences most of his advice by saying that this is what's worked for him, it might work for you, it might not. That's an honest answer, and I prefer it to the advice that makes it sound as though the author is the Word of God.  However, by giving his advice more as just bits and pieces rather than as an actual guide, the advice both becomes more fun to read, but also, I think, applies more to writers who are interested in the process of writing than, necessarily, some nice hard fast rules.  For instance, King writes, \\"I never got to like Carrie White...but I did have something there.  Like a whole career.  Tabby somehow knew it, and by the time I had piled up fifty single spaced pages, I knew it too...I had written three other novels before Carrie...But none of them taught me the things I learned from Carrie White.  The most important is that the writer's original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader's.  Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it's hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea.\\"  This is some interesting stuff - a remarkably humble look at the process of creation from a very good writer.  I also personally liked, \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others:  read a lot and write a lot.  There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut.\\"  And I loved King's description of a placid writer's retreat, just to follow it up with, \\"In truth, I've found that any day's routine interruptions and distractions don't much hurt a work in progress and may actually help it in some ways.\\"  Is any of this advice going to help you, the reader, write like Stephen King?  Almost certainly not - there aren't enough specifics.  But the book is some nice insight into the mind of a writer who has produced some amazing stuff, so it may well be worth reading for that alone.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|aww I bought the game on market just few  days ago..now its free app of the day. anyway it's well worth it even the paid version. 25+ hours of gameplay. FF style. if you liked FF snes series GO FOR IT!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady A just keeps getting better and better!!!  I cannot pinpoint one single song, but I can say each and every one holds a meaning to me and takes me back to one or more memories.  \\"Just A Kiss\\" tells me there is hope for true love.  We all now know Hilary was about to become an engaged woman when this came out as a single!!  Like I said, I cannot pick any song, because every song is amazing!!!  And I know I am one true fan, as I have their autograph tattooed on my leg, thanks to Hilary bending the rules and little and saying yes to doing it for me!!  LADY A ROCKS!!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is well worth the download....AMAZON RULES all these paid apps FREE!!!!! Over all pretty neat RPG great tyme killer and a nice fighting system which is  traditional.I've been waiting to download this game
B005LBJ2GQ|5.0|This doesn't happen, even with bands I love as top favorites. An album whose tracks ALL grab me as essential. The whole thing is captivatingly devious, fierce, sly, and unapologetic.  Opeth always requires listen after listen to comprehend the root concept. Heritage is all at once the least violently shifty (except for Famine) and yet most unique album from this artist. Musically I can only describe it as operatic, rock, death jazz. It's heavy-driving when it needs to be, and achieves striking levels of sullen, dark sound with the exact same precision (this is not new for Opeth). This album once again manages to magnify all past strengths in a way that has no amount of rehashing previous efforts.   1 & 2 on the album are as natural a start as every Opeth album openers. They belong together, two movements, inseparable.  Favorites/11 out of 10s, eventual sticklers in my full artist-mix playlist- I Feel The Dark, Nepenthe, Haxprocess.  The deepest track is Famine. They really go all out. It's a wildly creative piece of music.  The final track is as deathy and rustic as I could imagine music being.   One thing I found very interesting was the Offspring-y feel of Slither. The shorter Opeth tracks are hard to quantify. They are transitional, as compared to the standard track design where you get a whole timeline inside each track. I think that Slither itself works all alone, the guitar outtro fits for me more as a windup to begin Nepenthe. You always get some of that with Opeth music.  Having been a huge Opeth fan since the 5th album Blackwater Park, I won't say this album is the best one, but I can't say that about any of them! There hasn't been an album that hasn't blown me away. I can't wait for the october concert in my city.

0143116371|5.0|It's the most overrated book ever..... I'M JUST KIDDING! I PERSONALLY ENJOYED & I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE STYLISH FASHION PHOTOS. I loved it is a straight up look book and don't require a lot of reading. I ran across the The Sartorialist's blog a few years ago and I was very impressed with Scott's fashion photography. However, I will say 97% of the photos are stylish, color coordinate in some way, and were not very over the top. 1.5% of the photos were over the top and other 1.5% were unattractive. The only thing I can say I wish I seen way more minorities and men in casual sportswear style. Usually when I purchase a fashion style media on Amazon, I be very afraid it doesn't meet my expectations. Many people disliked my Seventeen Ultimate Guide to Style: How to Find Your Perfect Look [Paperback]<br />Ann Shoket (Author), Editors of Seventeen Magazine (Author) review. I'm planning to resale the book to Half Price's bookstore, but anyways The Sartorialist's book is a keeper. I enjoyed seeing the unique styles I had seen in the book. I love the book WASN'T TOO SERIOUS, ANTI ELDERLY, ANTI-MATCHING, TAKE THE LIFE OUT OF THE PICTURES, & PHOTOSHOP THEM TO DEATH. I'm a member of a well-known street fashion site. It's refreshing to see a style that isn't all about snapbacks (sometimes fitted) caps, designer shades (Ray Bans), street wear label graphic tees; bottoms such as slim fit, skinny jeans, or cargo shorts. Fashions such as denim jacket or outerwear all which is labeled by a brand from karmaloop, Levi's 501, or street wear label that color coordinates to over the top color way Nikes (such as Dunks or Blazers) or Jordans. It's not about being a hoarder of Nikes & Jordan sneakers. Fashion style doesn't mean three or four types of fashion styles (sneaker head, females who wear sexy revealing tight clubwear, over the top or over doing it anti match matchy fashionistia who threw too many pieces on, or in your face name brand labeled sportswear). I'm not degrading their styles. In The Sartorialist's book it is refreshing to see REAL STYLE NOT SOMETHING MADE UP BY SUPERIFICAL FASHION MEDIA OR DESIGNER.<br /><br />This why typical I afraid to purchase a fashion media, this be the case.<br /><br />*List \\"pieces\\" those are not realistic to find in the mall or designer boutique<br />*Never demonstrate how to wear a mass produced trend style wise realistically.

0671027344|5.0|I picked this book up when I was 21 and have since then read it 8 or 9 times now (I'm 25) The involvement with Charlies life becomes rather compelling and as you read the book you feel for him. Be it awkward situations with another same gender or themes of rape and suicide, I started to remember what it was like to be in high school. The book is written as a series of letters and every time I finished one I said \\"OK, that's enough.\\" But I couldn't stop. He mentions typical bands and novels that most people can relate to and that alone gives you a feel of how articulate Charlie really is as a person, and throughout his freshman year I felt like I was watching someone grow. This book will may possibly put a hole in your heart, and make you fill it with something you never thought was there. Even if it changes you for a week, isn't that reason enough?
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Even without the HD coat of paint, these games would still be a steal at this price. The behind the scenes videos are just awesome, and really show how much care went into making these classics. I'm sure The Last Guardian will recieve the same treatment, not only the time and effort put in from the creators, but the support and appreciation of the long-time fans. Great buy for newcomers and full trophy support gives veterans another reason to go through these adventures again and again. Don't let talk of control/camera issues or outdated graphics steer you away. These games are just as enjoyable now as they were on the PS2, and the graphics still impress.    Ico- 5 stars   Shadow of the Colossus- 5 stars   Collection- 10 stars
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay.  Certainly worth $0.99,  I think.  I can see what a previous reviewer meant when they said they had to be in a certain mood to play.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|So very glad to see this here.  Great game I've had for a bit that nite now my brother can grab for free!  No SD card option is the only con.  PLEASE ADD SD OPTION!
B002VPE1X4|3.0|Although this is a very low-cost case, the workmanship seems to be pretty good. Does not seem like the seams will fall apart during normal use.  However, I do not care for the material that it is made out of. While it will protect you electronics from scratches and dust, I prefer the tougher material used on cases made by companies like Lowepro and Case Logic. The material of this case is like what a laptop or tablet sleeve would be made out of... that thin spongy material. It will be fine for some folks; just depends what you're needs are.
0312576463|3.0|Where to start? The biggest problem with this book is the unlikeability of all of the main characters. There is nothing extraordinary about any of them. In fact, the whole book is steeped in depressing ordinariness. Everyone goes essentially in circles and no one seems to live with real verve or audacity. Joey starts out promising but Franzen's overweening politics then get in the way and turn Joey into someone who is not very interesting. It feels forced. Richard Katz is occasionally interesting in that he appears to be the only person in the novel capable of occasionally calling BS on the boring sterility that Franzen describes, but he too is far from sympathetic. Walter is awful: a boring, angry, sanctimonious person that I would not want to know. Patty, however, is the worst. First of all, she is not convincingly written. There is something blurry about her. Why would Richard Katz be in love with this weak, boring, neurotic? It doesn't make sense. Most of all I just wanted these people to disappear and take their boring, sterile universe with them. My own life is more interesting than this.    There is no joy in Freedom, nor is there any humor. The mirthlessness of the whole enterprise is very New York Liberal. A writer like Samuel Beckett is capable of handling darkness in a joyful, exciting way, a writer like Henry Miller is capable of handling frustration in a joyful, exciting way, but what we have here is just gratuitous wimpiness from A to Z. At no point does Franzen attempt to turn this wan atmosphere of impotence into something exciting, and there is a bureaucratic flavor to the whole enterprise. It seems like no coincidence that all of the characters end up embroiled in one bureaucratic scenario or another, for the simple reason that Franzen himself seems not to be in touch with the hard, real core of life but rather with some sort of bureacratic model of it...no coincidence, then, that all of his characters seem to be cut off from anything real, separated from life by a wall of bureaucracy.    When reading this, it was hard to avoid sensing the author's presence. Although his prose is not particularly stylized, I did not feel like I was reading about anyone but Jonathan Franzen (which is not the case when reading Balzac, for example). The whole thing is very New York Writerish...liberal politics...somewhat shrill resentment...occasionally forced metaphors...a sort of dull intelligence...this is a book about resentment. It is hard to imagine that Franzen himself is not essentially like one of these characters: a serious, somewhat resentful and humorless New York Writer and liberal. The personality that comes through is that of a man who is not particularly courageous or interesting, and that is the alpha and omega of the problem here: Franzen himself is just not someone whose ideas or life are interesting enough to bother reading about.  So, why did I give it three stars instead of one or two? Despite everything I mentioned above, the book is highly readable, and I could not put it down. I'm not sure why this was the case -- perhaps because of Franzen's generally unaffected prose (which is the book's greatest quality) -- but whatever the reason, any author who can make me read a 700-page novel about characters I do not respect in just a few days deserves at least a gentleman's C.   I can't believe these goofy critics who have called this mediocre book \\"The Great American Novel\\"...
0307887898|5.0|I worked at a startup for several years which failed, like the one Eric Ries started. My startup, too, spent an enormous number of person-years building a very elegant technology for a complex product that it turned out almost nobody really wanted to use. The company's managers floundered until they found harbor in a related line of business, but 100% of the work I personally did was throw away along with significant associated expenses.  Could this have been avoided? Ries' book shows the way. We could have much more cheaply tried a much more stripped-down version of what we built, realized that customers didn't want it, and then figured out what customers did want or which customers wanted something we could build. Maybe the company could have \\"pivoted\\" to the place it ultimately reached years earlier and without the enormous cost.  I'm about to start on some other projects that are totally different, not part of a startup business (actually run inside a governmental entity), and Ries' suggestions are just as apt. I hope to use the wisdom of the Lean Startup here so that we waste as little time or money as possible; after all, funds are much more limited for a government entity trying to innovate today than for a startup in the heyday of the dot-com boom!
B004JMRDQE|5.0|This film has been a favorite of mine since the 1st time I saw it. Over the years, at some time or another, it would play on one of the hundreds of TV stations I get on my satellite service and we would ALWAYS stop and watch it, to the end...it's so compelling. You have a real affinity for this man,(played by Tim Roth) who was born on the ship to an immigrant mother but left behind to be raised by the crew...and then never having any reason to leave the ship he didn't! Turns out he was quite the prodigy on the piano and played his own wonderful music with (and without regard to) the in-house bands! The additional cast is just as awesome as his friends who accept him just the way he is.  I don't think movie viewers have a complete and rounded out experience until they have seen this movie!! Do you have 100 stars that I can click on? :)[[ASIN:B000066744 The Legend of 1900]]
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Just received this case (replacing the AMZN Basics Leather Case I had, but broke). It's a little tough to get on - fits snuggly and material is not as pliable as silicone cases, but once it's on, it feels secure and solid in your hand. Adds very little bulk or weight to the phone. Slides easily in and out of the pocket of my jeans. Looks OK, but more importantly, should offer reasonable protection from accidental drops and daily knocking around. Don't think you could find a case to beat it for the price.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|This cable is perfect for allowing you to view any video on your apple devise on a much larger tv screen such as Hulu, Amazon-on-Demand, Netflix and HBO-to-go.  Everything you could possibly need to connect to a tv is permanently attached on one end and an apple connection cable is on the other.  Simply go through the options until you find the one that works for a specific tv and you have access to videos on your apple device.  I could use these on vacation for instant tv viewing of anything from my apple and not have to pay a premium price.<br /><br />This is really great for showing videos you have stored, or just took, to friends and relatives.  The 6.5 feet cable is more then enough length.  The only issue might be accessing component connections on more complicated home theater set-ups but for most, it's simple.  The price is a bargain when compared to apple's version of these cables.
B0017TFLBQ|1.0|Just got the game in the mail. Popped into my computer and clicked Might and Magic 3... nothing happened... So I clicked Might and Magic 4... was brought to the menu screen so I clicked install... nothing happened... I have an Alienware M11x which is more than capable of handling this game... So I guess I just wasted nine bucks I could have spent elsewhere other than a game that doesn't even work! I guess I'll put in on my shelf and have it collect dust, I can always IMAGINE that I'm playing it... Thanks Sold Out!

0553801473|2.0|A Trudge for Travelers would have been a more appropriate title, since so much of this book centers around the long, boring travels of its characters.<br />ADWD suffers from poor editing; there is a lot of stalling, very little plot advancement and characters get bogged down, so much so that reading becomes tedious (One gets the impression that writing it may have also been an exercise in drudgery).<br />There are some good parts (chapters with Bran, Arya, Drogon and Theon) though they are few and far between, and just how some of them tie in with the rest of the story remains to be seen.<br />I am a huge fan of GRRM and hope that he can get the series back on track. He has the in-enviable, mammoth task of bringing the story to a conclusion, while tying up storylines and coordinating timelines. I hope that he rediscovers his mojo and also enlist the help of good editors.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|great app, it does just what I needed and I like the multiple screen views with detailed information on each available ap.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was one of the childhood tv shows which I used to watch but could never have fully understood the stories, as a 20 year old I can appreciate the satire, cultual and political references. This was a must have for me because living in Australia at the tie of purchase this was a Region 1 exclusive, funnily enough though not long after purchasing this Daria came out in Australia \\"region 4\\" and which I promptly purchased again due to DVD restrictions. This set is excellent value containing all of the episodes and two movies, though the first movie is it Fall Yet should have been place in chronological order rather then on the last disc due to a bit of a story lapse if it is watched at the end. A little lacking in special features but this hardly bothers me. The Case it comes in is also much better then the region 4 release, it is done as a booklet rather then over here where 3 discs are slotted into the same page. I preffered this so much that I swtiched the cases for my region 4 discs.  Daria is a terrific show and although Darias droning voice can get a little irritating at times the stories, the characters and the mature themes really do make it a special show.

B000TENKV8|5.0|and watching an episode of Family Guy, when this weird commercial for some kind of violent x-box game came on. In the background of this commercial was a beautiful-voiced woman singing with a simple guitar chord accompaying her. I re-ran that commercial three times (I don't know how I ever survived without DVR). I went to the computer and googled the words 'into dust' and this album came up. I clicked on the song and knew I had the right one. I immediately dowloaded the MP3 album from Amazon and have played the heck out of it ever since. Oh the days of instant gratification! I have never heard of this group before but now that I have, I will be downloading everything from them I can get my hands on. Wonderful stuff!
B0001I561E|4.0|This was a good quality when I watched it. There wasn't really any scratches on it or anything. But it was not in an actual case that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5

B005OIAFQC|4.0|I grew up in the 1980's and love all types of Electronic Music (except the Lady Gaga and DJ pop mixes).  My favorite is the synth pop genre.  This album is more like that then some of their harder sounding previous stuff (which i like too!).  2 songs on this album are throw aways..they are On-air & Goodbye 20th Century (cost album a star).

B004047XXO|4.0|Great movie, but the glasses are not good at all. We have a 3D tv and the glasses just don't work for it. I wish I didn't have to buy the high tech ones! but other than that the movie is so cute and I enjoy watching it.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|First let me say that I'm relatively new to Mastodon.<br />My introduction was \\"Crack The Skye\\".<br />I still have to go back and check out the bands earlier work.<br />That said, I have heard a few clips on Youtube from \\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Blood Mountain\\" so I can see how fans who were there at the beginning feel somewhat betrayed.<br />Trust me I was one of those geezers who was with Metallica from the beginning and when the black album came out....I feel your pain.<br />The difference is Mastodon are releasing music that's actually good as opposed to \\"Load\\" and \\"Re Load\\" which were...I won't go there.<br />As I was saying, the first song I ever heard was \\"Oblivion\\" from \\"CTS\\".<br />I immediately went out and bought the album and loved it.<br />Except...the songs were a tad long for my tastes.<br />A brilliant album but very difficult to just listen to casually.<br />\\"CTS\\" is more of an event to listen to that I save for special occasions.<br />That said, \\"Hunter\\" reminds me a LOT of \\"CTS\\" except it's much more accessible.<br />I know old timers are going to scream sell out and...well...songs like \\"Blasteroid\\", \\"Curl of the Burl\\" could easily be on the radio.<br />Not that there aren't some heavy songs. \\"Black Tongue\\", \\"All the Heavy Lifting\\", \\"Dry Bone Valley\\"are all hard hitters.<br />I know \\"Creature Lives\\" is getting some flack but I honestly really love it.<br />It's definitely one of the stand outs.<br /><br />I just read that most of this album was written on the road while on tour with Alice in Chains and I think there is a definite AIC influence on this album vocal wise.<br />The dual harmonies are very present on songs like \\"Dry Bone\\".<br />All in all this album will do for Mastodon what the black album did for Metallica.<br />Hooks.<br />Memorable.<br />Shorter.<br />Catchy.<br />Brilliant musicianship.<br />One of the best rock records I've heard in ages.<br />Highly recommended.

B002436WFI|4.0|I was very pleased with this movie, it was faithful to the spirit of the book and adapted beautifully to the screen.  I understand why they would have taken a little flavor out of the world in order to streamline the inevitable need to spend minutes explaining, such as magicians never saying the number between 7 and 9, and that Rincewind was more of a bumbling fool and rather than a bit of a swindler for instance.  All in all, a fun film.
0525423281|5.0|My \\"I just finished this and these are my initial thoughts\\" goodreads review was the following:<br /><br />\\"Loved Lola and her costumes and her craziness. Cricket and his height and his hands. The setting and getting to revisit one of my favorite places ever. Lola's parents. St. Clair and Anna's cameos. Windows, the moon, and stars.... Another perfect read from Stephanie Perkins! I can't wait for the next one.\\"<br /><br />And that pretty much says it all. What's there left to say? The book was as wonderful as I expected it would be... and then some. However, as I've been waiting for this book since last December, I am going to dedicate more time to it and expand my review a bit.<br /><br />Lola: Such a fun character! I admired Lola's creativity and I eagerly looked forward to every new costume that she would put together. Despite her outward appearance, though, I was struck by how normal she was. Sure, she has a vibrant personality, too, but she's not overconfident, she has her insecurities, and she screws up. I loved her, but it was very easy to be frustrated by some of her actions and how selfish she could be. Thankfully, she does some growing up throughout the course of the book.<br /><br />Cricket: Where to even start with this perfect boy? He warms my heart with how sweet and adorable he is. Though he obviously has strong feelings for her, he's so respectful of Lola and, when they can't be together, he's always there for her -- and not in a \\"I'm waiting for you\\" creepy way, but just as the best kind of friend. The want is there, of course, but he doesn't act on it. He's also smart, talented with his hands (ha!), and TALL. Love you, St. Clair, but I love me some tall guys. Thank you, Ms. Perkins, for giving me another boy to gush over.<br /><br />The setting: San Francisco. If there's one thing you should know about me it's that I love San Francisco. I lived there for school and it's one of my goals to go back permanently some day. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when I found out that it would be the backdrop to Lola's story. I enjoyed nodding along to some of the references and getting to revisit some locations that I was familiar with.<br /><br />Lola's parents: Andy and Nathan were SO great. Their relationship with Lola was displayed as well-rounded: full of love and support, but also with fair boundaries for her. The three spent a good amount of time together and I adored seeing parents so involved! I think this is the first YA novel I've read that features two dads, too, so it's awesome that Stephanie Perkins had this dynamic in her book.<br /><br />St. Clair and Anna's cameos: THEY'RE BAAAAAACK! I won't give away any details about their appearances but I will say the following: they were in the book more than I expected, they're hilarious, and ILOVETHEMSOMUCH. I hadn't realized how much I missed them until they first appeared. I could be limited to reading about this duo (+ Lola and Cricket now) for forever and I'd be perfectly content.<br /><br />Windows, the moon, and stars: Yeah, I'm not getting too detailed on this point either, but believe me when I say that all three things are important. SWOON.<br /><br />Stephanie knows how to write a good romance and the tension between Lola and Cricket was almost unbearable: so aching, honest, and, yes, at times, even awkward. But the final result had me grinning from ear to ear, wanting to weep a little because it was all just so lovely to experience through these characters. So, yes, this was another perfect read from Stephanie Perkins and the countdown has begun for Isla and the Happily Ever After. I can't wait to be wrapped up in more of her delightful stories!o Lola's story. I enjoyed nodding along to some of the references and getting to revisit some locations that I was familiar with.

B0057ZAA0S|5.0|In 1996, director Danny Boyle made a name for himself with his adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Trainspotting. Over the years, the film has continued to be a great success with critics and audiences, growing a larger fanbase with every passing year. Now, the film has debuted on Blu-Ray so fans can finally enjoy the film in high-definition.  MOVIE:  Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is the narrator and protagonist, a young man who has chosen to live his life as a heroin addict in Scotland. Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Begbie (Robert Carlyle), and the clean-cut, non-addict Tommy (Kevin McKidd) comprise Renton's close circle of friends, all essentially in the same boat as him. The film progresses in a mostly episodic way, following Renton through his heroin addiction, his multiple attempts to quit and stay clean, and the trouble his addiction frequently gets him in. Nearly every scene is an example of Renton getting himself into trouble and trying to find his way out, be it getting in trouble with the cops or accidentally sleeping with a young schoolgirl (Kelly Macdonald). Trainspotting has a straight-forward narrative, but doesn't allow itself to be restricted by it. This is a film that moves with energy and purpose.   With a running time of only 90 minutes, its remarkable how much happens. While it maintains a singular tone throughout, there's a combination of genres within the movie that probably account for its continuing popularity. It's character-driven, with very memorable characters and is very funny at one moment and very tragic the next. It effectively uses surreal imagery, such as Renton's famous toilet-diving scene, while also functioning as a strong drug movie, allowing the characters to romanticize heroin while showing the tragedy that accompanies the use of the drug.   The soundtrack, consisting of both classical and pop music, the brightly colored cinematography, and the overall composition heavily recalls Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.When the characters go to a club, the layout of the club reveals this as intentional. Trainspotting was actually edited by the studio due to the heavy Scottish accents and their fear that American audiences would have trouble understanding them. Well, I admittedly had trouble with them at times but it's all about paying attention (and some extra help from subtitles perhaps). Darkly funny, with memorable characters, a stunning performance by McGregor, and uniquely flavored direction by Danny Boyle; Trainspotting is a pop-culture masterpiece that won't lose steam any time soon.  BLU-RAY:  In case you're wondering, the Blu-Ray looks stunning. I compared a scene from both the Blu-Ray and the DVD on the same 1080p TV and even the most untrained eye could notice a substantial difference in picture-quality. The beauty and color of the film nearly pop out of the screen, however, technical aspects aside, the Blu-Ray is not quite perfect. First of all, it's not the uncut edition which has an extended sex scene and a shot of a heroin needle penetrating a vein. These changes don't affect the plot, but most people would rather see a film in its intended form. In addition, the Blu-Ray's special features are lacking. How hard is it for studios to carry their special features over from previous releases? If you love this film and you want to see it in the most high-definition way, this is worth buying for the cheap price you'll find it for. However, be forewarned that you can probably expect a double-dip in the future.  GRADE: A-
B004XNGKBS|3.0|its ok i guess, but not for me.  Tried mine on my tablet to  be able to jot down things like a real notebook, but was  dissapointed. You use ur finger to write, which i  thought  would be great. But it doesnt allow your strokes to be long,  causing very crappy looking hand writting. Neat concept, but needs work.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|The writing was so atrocious it made me cringe.  The author never got the hang of dialog and so be prepared to read neverending: \\"xxx!\\" said America, \\"ccccc\\" said Shepley, \\"dddd\\" exclaimed Travis, \\"kkkkk\\" replied Shepley.  I felt like I was reading a high school creative writing assignment.  The ridiculous story line just made it more cringe-inducing. What a skunk of an attempt at a book.

B001SWQYGI|5.0|My band had been doing full P.A. system band rehearsals, which has made for a lot of decibel exposure.  I always had to wear earplugs, which is by no means ideal as a vocalist.  We recently started playing with a click track, and decided to try doing an in-ear system to better hear the click over everything.  Now we run the click and vocals through a little 8 channel mixer, then take the stereo out into this microamp, and voilà, 4 adjustable in-ear channels.  Granted, we have to all share the same mix, but at least I can keep from going deaf, since I use isolating earphones.  This product does everything I had expected it to do.  No noise issues or anything like.  I have been using it about 2 months.  Will update review if any issues occur.
B000BT97AO|4.0|This movie is really interesting and strange but what else would you expect from neil gaiman? The creatures are really fun and scary at times, expect to see floating giants and kitties with man faces! It has a really sweet plot and keeps you staring to not miss a scene so you can follow. I'm a huge fan of the creators so if you are too then you should check it out! thanks to Amazon for having this because I couldn't find it anywhere in stores!
B005G4TJUC|1.0|Where to begin? The movie sucks. The plot is stupid. The one star is for the CGI work that was put into this movie. Shia Labeouf with his very limited acting, plays the same character in basically every movie he makes including this one. The plot was ridiculous with awkward, lame attempts at comedy throughout the movie and I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters. Very weak story telling. It's a lot of boom, crash, explosions, wrapped around a stupid story line that requires you to leave your brain at the door. And if that doesn't make you want to run out screaming from this movie, maybe having to look at that perpetual duckfaced girl throughout the movie might. I almost turned this movie off about half way though because it's so boring, but I stuck it out. Hopefully, this is the last Transformers movie they make. The only thing that sells this movie is the name Transformers, because the movie itself is just sad. If you want a completely brain dead movie, bad acting, poor plot, duckfaced fake girl with over-the-top, unbelievable(in a bad way) action scenes, then this is the steaming pile of crap you want. Enjoy.
1419702203|5.0|... I'd like to comment on the portions of this book that were especially thrilling to me.  As the others have said, it's beyond beautiful - the content, the production, the overall design - it's all stunning.  I loved seeing so many photographs taken by George, starting WAY back when.  Seeing the other Beatles through his lens allows me to forget long-told stories of friction & animousity between the men, and focus on what had to be extraordinarily strong and loving relationships between the members of the Beatles that (I choose to believe) lasted a lifetime.  But the sections of the book that have me slowing down and absorbing everything shown and written are:  1) the extensive look at George Harrison's remarkable relationship with Ravi Shankar; 2) photos of the first years rescuing Friar Park, clearly showing what a daunting task it was and paving the way for a true appreciation of George's dedication to \\"gardening\\"; and 3)photos and quotes from George's friends in the auto-racing world.  I knew of his passion, but nothing of where his fascination with fast cars and love of the thrill of racing came from.    With such a broad scope, it's inevitable that I was left wanting more and I PRAY that's where the documentary will show itself as a true companion piece to this book.  Olivia Harrison has given her husband and his fans an incredibly generous gift:  a loving look at a MAN who lived an almost unbelievable life, literally, and lived it to the fullest - with passion, curiousity, enthusiasm and grace.  I can't imagine anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of George Harrison that WOULDN'T be thrilled with this book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I decided to download this little app for something fun. I figured it would be just your typical run of the mill phone game. Boy was I wrong. I was addicted the moment I opened it. The graphics and music are amazing. The character is well drawn and friendly looking. The game itself is challenging and fun. This game is a nice change of pace from the usual junk that you see out there. Kudos to the developers on this one!
B000069HZP|5.0|After watching the film and reading many reviews here even the ones who gave the movie a 1 star, I have decided to write about what this movie meant to me.  Please if you have not watched the movie DO NOT READ THIS)To me this movie is about a life changing experience for the main character Nicholas Van Orton  Michael douglas). It is all about HIS journey that will teach him many things about life itself. He went from being in control of everything  finances, safety, commodity, friendships, trust) from being a millionaire to being a no body, to be humbled , to feel hunger, to feel insecurity, to feel despair, to feel fear, to feel poor. He gained a life changing experience and I only wish that money could buy what this man got from this \\"game.\\" At the end of the movi you could feel he was not the same. You could feel his love for his ex wife.  in a \\"I apologize for everything\\" way) I think Nicholas at the end was very thankful that he had such an amazing journey. I mean ALL the things he experienced are things WE TOO should be able to experience once in a while. Maybe it will humble us to find a journey where we have no control over our lives.... yes it will sure be painful but worth it . It would be like taking everything we once knew JUST SO we could appreciate it. Wouldn't you love that?
B000JIHP88|4.0|My son absolutely loves this mobile.  He'll stare up at the faces of the little creatures (a lizard, parrot, monkey, and bug) and giggle like crazy, it's hilarious to watch.<br /><br />What I really love about it is that it's super bright and colorful; my son has no trouble focusing on it at 4 months old.  It was also easy to put together and simple to attach to the crib.  The music box part plays 18 minutes of classical tunes and its volume settings seem adequate to me.<br /><br />The mobile portion is detachable for when baby doesn't need that bit anymore, and the music box has a nightlight (not too bright) which has proven useful.<br /><br />All in all I love this product and definitely recommend it.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I read the reviews and decided to download after reading good things about it. I try to load the game but it force closes after loading. Unfortunately i have to uninstall. Too bad...
0553801473|1.0|I typically pride myself on elegantly written and thoughtful reviews, but this book just plain sucked. Almost nothing happens, and everything that does happen doesn't finish.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I highly reccomend this game it's 1 of the best for android. its a game that anyone in your family can play , had a great price.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|Concerning BLU-RAY customers... DO NOT BUY THIS RELEASE.  Warner Bros. have once again, screwed the fans/customers over... because they WILL release this in Blu-Ray 3D.... just like all their other past, and future, releases which had 3D Theatrical Releases.... but they'll wait until they feel enough non-3D versions have been sold (usually 3 to 6 months), before releasing a FULL/TRUE release of this movie.    --- THIS IS A PRODUCT REVIEW... NOT A MOVIE REVIEW ---    They've done this already with several other titles... and more are coming... like Harry Potter's finale for example... and there seems to be no end in sight to this nonsense.... so send them a message, and do not buy this INFERIOR release.  Whether you already have 3D capability or not... it's just smarter business/financial sense, to buy the complete 3D COMBO-Pack when it's released... not only because it will only cost $2-$5 more than THIS release... but because it will LIKELY include a \\"Special 2-Disc (blu-ray) Edition\\", as they did with the previous 2 Transformers movies/releases (the 2nd disc being all or mostly all, HD bonus features, etc.).    === This release not only does NOT contain 2 blu-ray discs (which means less special features &/or LESS HD QUALITY available if they tried to cram a lot of features onto just 1 disc, leaving less room for the highest possible quality-transfer of the movie)... but again, they don't even include the 3D version.... and if you think for one second, that they spent all that money churning out a 3D Theatrical Release, only to NOT release it in blu-ray 3D... well, you're a fool... and you should go ahead & buy THIS blu-ray/dvd combo-pack release, and stop reading.  I've rented this release from Netflix -- it arrives tomorrow -- I will rip it & hold on to my rip, until WB takes it's thumb out of it's collective behind, and releases this properly... just as I've done w/ all the other titles they've done this to. ___ Keep it up W.B., and I will stop seeing them in the Theater as well!
0786838655|4.0|This book awakened the kid in me and made me travel to the farthest part of my mind which is my imagination. Percy is quite a lovable school boy who was blamed and thought to steal Zeus' lighting bolt. From the plot itself, it is very interesting. I also love Greek mythology and how Riordan incorporates them to create a wonderful story is really fascinating. A good book for any given day. Keep it up!
B005P06AAO|5.0|I was wonder if that dvd haav closed captions and/or subities for deaf and hard of hearing??  Becuase I am deaf and i want to watch the dvd with cc or subities cuz i love that show so much.
B005OKMBAI|3.0|This is a great show.  It reminds me of My So Called Life, and is absolutely hilarious.  However, Amazon gets the show really late.  They're streaming on MTV way before they're made available for subscribers/purchasers.    So, I'm not entirely sure it's worth the purchase.  Unless you've got some huge desire to own the episodes, you might as well save your money and stream it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 9 year old daughter and I really like this game.  requires thought and strategy but isn't too hard to play. The graphics are awesome and it runs well.  As others have said,  it takes a while to load when opening the game but that is the only time when it lags- after that,  smooth sailing.  Get it!
B004ZN9RWK|2.0|I'd like to know who made the decision on how the tracks were separated and if he was drinking at the time. I understand that one song merges into another and the CD should be listened to as a whole and not individual tracks, but at least whoever put together the version I bought back in the 80's understood that you DO NOT separate tracks in mid-lyric or in the midst of a musical phrase when there is clearly a spot that makes more sense. If I thought I could return this and get my money back, I would; remastered and improved sound or not. As it is, I'm going to try to do my best Alan Parsons and correct the problems with my Roxio software. Failing a suitable fix, I'm sticking with my 20+ year-old copy on my computer/Mp3 player.
B0001I561Y|5.0|I have always loved this movie ever since I was a kid. I'm very pleased that Disney has chosen to give it a re-release and to also made it a collectable for true fans of the film. Hopefully they decide to release this and the other 2 Aladdin films on Blu-Ray.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game definitely brings back memories of FinalFantasy can't wait to play it more. Great job Dec.<br /><br />If your looking for a great RPG this is it.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|have to admit, im addicted. by far one of if not the best rpg out the on the android markets today. graphics bring you back to to the good ol' days, but cleaner clearer and more colorful. personally im not a fan of the virtual joystick idea, but they have found s a way to make it ideal and pleasant to use. though it should come with a help screen or manual of some sort for some of the game such as the merit point system as none of them are explained most of them are common sense but there's one or two I don't know what it is and would like to read up on. they need to fix a few of the context typos but it dosent interfere with the story, just makes you think &quot;lol what the heck&quot;  finally, I enjoy the game, but its all really just fighting and no side quests, from one boss to another the time in between is quite short. they could do more in the next upcoming games if any. that's where my 5th star comes in. would I recommend? definitely! could there be more improvements? definitely! what I buy the next game? definitely! joy hope there's a next game? definitely!
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book was amazingly boring to read in the beginning.  Like others, this book was recommended to me.  I forced myself to read through the first five chapters and was just about to quit reading it when it FINALLY picked up.<br /><br />Yes there were translation issues in the book.  Was this annoying?  Sometimes.  But it didn't hinder the book itself.<br /><br />This book is dark, not for the wimpy out there.  If you cannot deal with dark issues, don't read this book.<br /><br />What kept me coming back to the book was Lisbeth Salander.  This girl is messed up!  And if you only read this book, then you would not understand why she is they way she is.  I've finished the series and long for more Lisbeth Salander.
B0009X1SKY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this early complete set of Saturday matinee MET performances from 1951.  This was the Met's first broadcast cycle since 1933.  The singing is uniformly excellent and Stiedry's conducting is similar to Bodanzky's tempi--fleet and edited.  The sound quality is generally good with a solid mono reproduction better than the typical aircheck recordings from the period.  I enjoyed these performances far better than Stiedry's later 1954 Parsival from the same house.  The orchestral playing here for this ring cycle is very good.  Obviously, the Met had some fine artists sitting in the pit first chairs then too.  This set should never be someone's first ring cycle purchase, but for those looking deeper into the catalogs, this performance has many merits.  I could only wish that a repertory theater of today could cast as strongly as this set displays.  Even the Norns are cast strength to strength here.  Recommended.
B001NLKT60|4.0|What an excellent book!  I couldn't put it down.  The pace was certainly quicker than Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />As with the previous book, this book was dark.  But at the same time, I actually found myself laughing a few times.  Paolo Alto's comment to Blomkvist when he was in the hospital actually cracked me up.<br /><br />What an ending to the book!  It had me wanting more.  Thankfully Hornet's Nest was out already.  Otherwise I would have gone nuts!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I've been playing this game for a few hours now and can honestly say this is one of my favorite FAOTD! It is a great time killer. The only thing is I wish it was a tiny bit more challenging as I've almost completely beat the game in less than a day. Hopefully future updates will bring more challenges.   Graphics are great, loading is quick, no lags, no glitches at all which is unusual for me. Overall it's great.   I rated 4 stars as it's almost too easy for me and I will be out of levels to play by tomorrow afternoon. Though my hubby is having a little bit of difficulty and it would be helpful to have some hints for those that have trouble getting a perfect score on a level.   HTC Incredible  Android 2.3.4
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The ending of a wonderful trilogy...<br /><br />I did not want to finish this book knowing full well that I would need my fix of Lisbeth.  Lisbeth grew on me.  When I wasn't reading about Lisbeth, I was thinking about her.  Now that it's over, I long for Lisbeth.<br /><br />It was great that Lisbeth finally received some justice.  If there is anyone in the world who deserved justice, she is the one.<br /><br />The ending got me a little choked up and teary eyed.  Never happened before.<br /><br />Please give us book #4.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|Enjoyable simplicity of yesteryear. Two problems: game is not saved and must be rebooted if you leave the screen. Secondly, there seems to be a bug in which I cannot' equip' my characters with items. V 1.0.8 htc glacier  UPDATE: Equip feature doesn't work on the item page, you have to go into the character page.  Also, I have had the game crash my phone 3x now. Now the app is gone from my phone. Cannot figure out how to get it back. It's a fun game!  UPDATE: Though game completely disappeared twice from my phone (not listed in Apps nor could I discover a folder with File Expert), it returned, complete with my saved data. Not sure why it did this, but has not done it in a while. I have the stock 2.3 ROM.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|DOTM made it easy to forget 2009's ROTF.  The \\"plot\\" was much improved, possibly because there was only ONE writer this time.  Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen were in this movie.  A great way to end the series, as well.  If they made any more, I would hope it would be the military and Autobots working together to hunt down Decepticons, similar to how ROTF started out.    Please take my advice: how good a movie is has nothing to do with the studio wanting to get consumers to buy the movie twice. If you disagree, then spam the studio with correspondence rather than deduct stars from your review.    Try it this way next time: \\"DOTM was a fantastic action film, but I am disappointed the Blu-Ray release hardly has any extras.  Otherwise, 5 STARS!!!!\\"

0385344325|5.0|I had been disappointed with some of Reacher's latest outings. This one ranks as one of the best in a long time if not the whole series. While some of the plot points stretch credulity a bit, it's vintage Reacher at his investigative and close combat best. The surrounding characters are substantial and Child could probably even pull a Robert Crais when he spun off Joe Pike and spin off one of these characters into a parallel series. I'd be interested in seeing at least two of them again even in a stand alone. I hope the series stay a little closer to the believable even if this wasn't the biggest surprise ending. Almost like Columbo, it was how Reacher got to the ending rather than the identity of the killer.

B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I like this game because it's an actual rpg not a glorified side scroller with level ups. I like the touch-anywhere controls instead of a joystick. Only reason it gets a 4 not 5 is because figuring out things is a little difficult. The help screen pages should show screenshots of the element it is referring to.

1609611543|5.0|This book is a wealth of information.  I gave up wheat (and all white flour, sugar, and processed foods) years ago but if I had not already done so, I surely would NOW!  The new strains of GM grains are nothing like \\"wheat\\"!  They are keeping our blood glucose high, insulin high, fat in storage, and pancreas worn our (or worse still, diseased with cancer, etc.  One sure fire way to lose the weight  and gain health is to READ THIS BOOK and do as Dr Davis recommends.  I have found new ways to make EVERYTHING over the past years.  I eat pancakes, waffles, great chicken, fish, & vegetables dishes...  I make wonderful desserts and believe me, I am NOT missing a thing.  I am 5 foot 8 and wear a size 6.  I owe this all to eating like the good Dr recommends, as my family has a big problem with diabetes and weight.  I use coconut flour, almond flour, stevia, etc in my cooking.. all natural.  BUY THE BOOK... what do you have to lose but a LOT of weight?  I believe the book is God given and inspired!

1609611543|5.0|By following the advice in this easy to understand and logical book, I not only lost weight, but gained control of my blood pressure, IBS, migraines, candida, moods, energy levels, the need to nap mid afternoon and insomnia - need I say more?  Before ditching wheat, I knew the location of every restroom on my routes - I no longer need to know.  When I say going wheat free can change your life - it certainly changed mine immeasurably, and for the better.  The book costs around $15 - for those naysayers out there, how much are your prescription meds costing?  Maybe rather than relying on \\"scientific evidence\\", you should try it for a month and let your body and mind be the evidence?

B0052GACNM|2.0|Tony Bennett released Duets II as a celebration of his 85th birthday -- happy birthday Tony! Sporting 17 tracks with an array of young and old artists that cross all manner of genres (R&B, Country, Rap, Jazz, Vocal Standards, Pop, Rock...) the album serves well as a tribute to Tony's incredibly long -- and continuing -- career. We're talking about a career that spans more than sixty years and in many ways is at it's most vital point today -- incredible.<br /><br />Bennett's career and birthday celebration aside however, I don't place Duets II into the \\"gotta have\\" stack. I've never been a big fan of these cross genre duet albums -- finding the match-ups jarring and  uneven as often as not -- and this album doesn't really do anything to change my mind.<br /><br />It is interesting to hear these folks take a swing at singing some of Tony's greatest  songs but some of the efforts are uninspired ... and these classic tracks deserve better. That said there are a few nice renditions that were delivered by some very surprising artists.<br /><br />I almost can't believe what I'm about to type ... Lady Gaga delivers the best effort on this album (ack!) carrying off a fresh and fun version of \\"The Lady is a Tramp\\". She does a great job with the vocals and Tony seems genuinely taken with Gaga's semi-bofo ad libs. If that wasn't weird enough, the other song that I thought stuck out (positively) on Duets II was \\"The Girl I Love\\" with Sheryl Crow. I was a pretty big fan of \\"early Rock\\" Crow but was floored by her impressive performance and how nicely her vocals complement Tony's natural style.<br /><br />I usually love Queen Latifah's standards efforts and she does well with \\"Who Can I turn To\\" but it's not up there with her other American Songbook work. Similarly I was just generally pleased with Natalie Cole, k.d. lang, Nora Jones, and Michael Bubl&eacute; but not blown away by any means. Wanted to like Amy Winehouse's attempt to channel Billie Holiday with \\"Body and Soul\\" but sadly I just didn't. Willie Nelson does an interesting \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" that Tony does genuinely seem to enjoy ... the rest of the numbers were pretty much meh for me.<br /><br />Bottom line here is that none of these tracks are songs that I really want to hear again. It was fun to be surprised by Lady Gaga and Sheryl Crow but I'm not hot to queue up those numbers for another go. It's me I know ... I just don't really get much out of any of these late career/cross genre duets albums. I wasn't drawn to Sinatra's Duets/Duets II albums and likewise I don't get juiced up for Tony's versions either.<br /><br />If you are signed up on one of the \\"all you can eat\\" music streaming services Duets II is worth a listen, but unless you're a Tony Bennett super-freak and need to have everything he records, I don't recommend spending hard dollars for this CD.eresting \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" that Tony does genuinely seem to enjoy ... the rest of the numbers were pretty much meh for me.

0307887898|4.0|This book is essential for all the new entrepreneurs and managers of how innovativeness is essential.<br /><br /> The Lean Startup  is about what we can learn from those businesses to improve  everything we do.  This book provides some ideas how to create and manage startup-businesses and improve the time from product development to markets.  It gives you advice how to work faster, waste less, fail fast and cheap. (This might sound funny but it's true... you can fail slow and waste a lot of money... this books shows you just the opposite: how to save your time and efforts even if you fail. As a business owner/manager you know that not all the R&D processes and new innovations work in real world - some products do fail, and sometimes when a new innovation fails, it has already cost a lot of money and time to your company.)<br /><br />Some might say that there is really nothing new in this book: there are hundreds of books of how to succeed, how to create a successful business, etc. That's true.<br />However, this book and its method of Lean Starup uses the \\"build-measure-learn feedback\\" loop. The first step is figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then developing a minimum viable product (MVP) to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible. Once the MVP is established, a startup can work on tuning the product. This will involve measurement and learning and must include actionable metrics that can demonstrate cause and effect question. This is like a prototyping a new product: you build the product/service, you figure out how to measure it, you learn all there is about your product and if there is anything wrong about it, you can still fix it and redo the steps again.<br /><br />Even if you have read several of the other \\" how to succeed in business\\" and \\" how to manage a startup business\\" - books then you should still check out this book. It still stresses the most important issues in product development and delivery: you need to have a good quality, \\"ready product\\" to offer, otherwise you will lose customers.

B005DZMODI|5.0|If this album doesn't lift your mood and spirits you can't possibly have a pulse.  This is music at its very best and it is definitely best to ignore some of the largely ill-informed \\"this isn't blues\\", \\"this isn't Clapton\\", \\"this is c**p\\" reviews from some of people contributing, who, demonstrably, seem to have little musical knowledge, appreciation or taste. Quite simply, this is a terrific and infectious album - a joy to listen to.  I have been a Clapton fan since I was 12 in the mid-1960s and, in my opinion, this is one of the best albums he has put out in  a long time.  It has been fascinating watching Clapton's progress over the past five or six years - it's almost as if he is doing a final lap of honour before he shuffles off this mortal coil. First he reforms Cream, then gets Derek Trucks to take on the Duane Allman role in a reprise of Derek and the Dominoes, next he links up with Steve Winwood for what was effectively a Blind Faith reunion, records an album with JJ Cale . . . etc, etc (and long may it continue!)  I've been lucky enough to see him live quite a few time recently and by a long way his worst performance came when he was on his own, just playing with his band. These days he seems to need somebody else to bounce off, and when he finds a collaborator or sidekick of the calibre of Wynton Marsalis (or Winwood or Trucks) his own performances have been elevated.  This album is highly recommended and for fans of Clapton looking for another guitarist to \\"worship\\" look no further than Derek Trucks, who will keep the flame burning for years to come. If you haven't heard it yet check out Revelator by the Tedeschi Trucks Band.

0618918248|5.0|I've got to admit, as a 60+ year old who's been a nonbeliever since my teens, what joy could there be in rehashing all the familiar arguments?  Frankly, I was skeptical that I'd actually finish Dawkin's book, The God Delusion ... but, in the past, I've enjoyed reading his books on evolution and science.  So why not take a chance that Dawkins could deliver a decent and entertaining, book about atheism?<br />I found that this is an excellent book, well written and organized with clarity.  While many of his arguments were familiar to me,  Dawkins presented them with his own personal observations, several surprising analogies and philosophical, moral and ethical implications which greatly reinforced the impact.<br />In reading the reviews, including many on Amazon,  it's curious that those who feel threatened by the success of The God Delusion (and other popular works by atheist authors Harris, Dennett and Hitchens) typically chastise the author claiming how \\"bitter and angry\\" he seems. This is the common complaint among negative reviewers, many who are simply defending their own faith and belief in god(s).<br /><br /> I found nothing of the sort in the God Delusion - Dawkins is sincere and forceful, but he also brings some humor and appropriate sarcasm to the discussion. More importantly, Dawkins points out that religion has typically been given a \\"pass\\" when it comes to criticism - it's considered impolite to ask for evidence regarding the statements made by pastors, priests and imans, however unsupported or divisive they may be. Dawkins challenges the notion that religions should operate with impunity in a dogmatic intellectual vacuum.  If you want a bit more vitriol in your atheist rhetoric, then add Chris Hitchen's \\"God Is Not Great - How Religion Poisons Everything\\" to you reading list.  For a more cerebral look at religious thought and personal philosophy, Daniel Dennett's \\"breaking The Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon\\" is a must have.<br /><br />Any person who has serious questions about their personal theological choices, the meaning of their faith and religious practices should read this book (among others) along with the Bible, Koran and Vedas.tions about their personal theological choices, the meaning of their faith and religious practices should read this book (among others) along with the Bible, Koran and Vedas.
B005EHNEDO|4.0|It has been a long time since Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy has sounded as restless, wounded and alive as he does on The Whole Love, and I for one am glad for his return to form after consecutive unremarkable albums.  On 2007's Sky Blue Sky, Tweedy seemed to be sleepwalking through the band's material and on 2009's Wilco: The Album he seemed to be planting his tongue in his cheek and distancing himself emotionally from his listeners.  But for the first time since 2004's A Ghost Is Born, Tweedy and his band seem to have rediscovered their creative hunger and delivered an album that is diverse, experimental and emotionally resonant.<br /><br />The twelve songs on this album bounce around from the dark and moody opener,  The Art of Almost,  to the melodic yet mournful closer, One Sunday Morning (Song For Jane Smiley's Boyfriend) where Tweedy ruminates on the death of his father and delivers lyrics such as \\"I fell in love with the burden holding me down\\".  Here we have the tormented pop genius who has been largely missing since 2004 and it's hard not be thankful for his return even when he's delivering a lyric as openly honest and painful as \\"I was born to die alone\\" on Born Alone. The entire album weaves these qualities together.  Varying styles and genres, abundant creativity, plaintive lyrics and songs that reveal new surprises with each listen.  In the end, The Whole Love reminds us that Wilco is still the real deal especially when Tweedy taps into his inner torment.  That's where great music is often born.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|It's daunting to try to review one of the greatest albums of all time...so I'm not even going to try to focus on the merits of this album as a rock masterpiece.  Let's face it, most folks reading this review are wondering whether such an extravagant box set is worth the $$$$, and likely have already owned multiple releases of this album over their lifetimes.  Personally, I have owned the following versions: original LP, original CD pressing, 1992 \\"Shine On\\" Box pressing, 1994 remaster, MFSL gold pressing....YEESH!<br /><br />But I really have to say this is the best version.<br /><br />The closest comparison I can think of are the Beatles' 2009 remasters.  This remaster similarly has a slightly wider dynamic range and depth than all the other remasters.  I really hear more resonance here, especially on the drums (clearly Nick Mason was involved here).  The bass lines seem better-resolved, and have a more nice, rich \\"thunk\\" that I've heard before.  I'm listening to \\"Eclipse\\" as I write this, and it has a pure richness that surpasses previous versions.  It doesn't seem as much of a sonic quantum leap as the Beatles remasters did, but that's only because Floyd have been incrementally improving this puppy for the last 35 years.  I do feel safe saying that this is a clear improvement over any other remaster you have heard....with the possible exception of the \\"Oh...By the Way\\" version, which I never picked up.<br /><br />As for the box set extras:<br /><br />Let's start with the Wembley '74 recording.  This has been one of my all-time favorite bootlegs for the last 30 years, and the fact that it FINALLY sees the light of day as a legitimate release is sheer brilliance.  I can't wait for the pre-release \\"Animals\\" and \\"Shine On\\" material, and hope that the version of \\"Echoes\\" from this gig gets released as well.  If you've nevr heard this performance before, you OWE it to yourself to at least get the Experience version of this album.  Wembley '74 has never sounded better!!!<br /><br />But do you really need the rest of the stuff in the box set?  Well....it really depends.  If you have a Blu-ray player, then I say yes.  Hearing DSOTM in all it's HD 5.1 glory is truly amazing.  The concert films and live 1972 performances are wonderful, and even having been a Floyd fan for 25 years, I still don't have a good enough sense of what it was like to experience the classic lineup live.  This set helps that a bit.  Finally, Disc 6 is Floyd Heaven.  The '72 demo mix, the live pre-release tracks, and the Household Objects curiousity track are must-haves for anyone with even the remotest historical interest in Pink Floyd.  For me, I don't find these to be \\"listen-to-them-once and-forget-about-them\\" tracks, either.  I suspect these are going to keep me coming back.<br /><br />The other box set stuff isn't really necessary, but does round out the whole \\"immersion\\" theme nicely.  Someday, my grandkids will inherit this box, and perhaps get some sense of what the excitement was all about.  I just wish they had got rid of the scarf, and perhaps included a tour book replica or something.<br /><br />In the end, I'm happy to have made this purchase.  I do think the Experience Edition will be enough for most fans....but at the very least get that version for the new live material!the stuff in the box set?  Well....it really depends.

B0057MFA42|5.0|The picture and sound are amazing. I couldn't be happier with this blue ray. This is how it's done people.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|So enough has been said about this album in many other Amazon reviews.  This is my favorite Pink Floyd album, although it didn't always hold this status.  On first hearing, it can seem very dense and inaccessible, given the length of the three main tracks.  But the old addage of \\"rewards repeated listens\\" certainly applies here.  The only real knock is that Rick Wright seems missing-in-action on this record, a fact generally attributed to his heavy cocaine use during the recording of this record (and which would eventually lead to his outster after \\"The Wall\\" was recorded).  So while I would rate \\"Wish You Were Here\\" a VERY close second, this remains the best PF album, IMO.  So....the big question is the sound quality.  I owned the original CD pressing of this album, the 1992 box set version, the 1996 remaster, and now this version.  My overall opinion is that there have been discernible improvements with every release, and this time is definitely no exception.  The closest parallel I can think of is the Beatles' 2009 remaster campaign.  This album, like those, seems to have a deeper sound, with more resolution around the bass end.  The drums have a nice, throaty sound (most evident in the verse of \\"Pigs\\"), and I can definitely hear the bass line better now (and this is even more noticable on \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" as an aside).  During the acoustic portion of \\"Dogs,\\" I swear I can hear the clicking of Gilmour's pick on the guitar strings.  And the last verse of \\"Dogs\\" packs a bigger punch than on any version I can remember.  But with Pink Floyd, the silent parts are almost important as the notes they play, and it's here where I can really hear something different going on.  Its the space BETWEEN the notes that sound really quiet and clean here, giving everything that much more punch with each drumbeat.  If you are an audiophile with even a modest setup, and if having the best version of the album is important to you, grab this release, and for $11.99 (at Best Buy), you will definitely not be disappointed.  If you do most of your listening on an MP3 player at low encoding rates, the improvements here may be lost on you.

B005CW5E3E|5.0|This album is great fun - up beat, great arrangements and JW in excellent voice. Some of the best slide guitar on any album, thanks to the likes of Sonny Landreth, Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks. A great Nashville take on Maybellene featuring Vince Gill, and John Popper (who can be a tad too predictable in my book) does a really nice job in Last Night. Sometimes these types of albums featuring All Star guests turn into mush, but not here; every song is great and has a lot of momentum. Well engineered and produced as well. Even if you are not a great JW fan, but like jump blues, your gonna like this album.

B004XCUEU2|5.0|If you're a Foo Figthers fan then this DVD is well worth the money.  It's not some drama filled, drug fueled documentary, but more an intimate picture of how the band started and more importantly the things needed to keep the band together for all these years.  What was intriguing about the whole movie was how humble the band is about it's success and knowing that it could all end tomorrow.  I believe it runs about 1 hour and 37 minutes of which there is no fluff, it's about the band the whole time.

This is five separate books in a boxed set so you could gift each book separately if you choose.<br /><br />What amazes me is how great they are for a child starting to read.<br /><br />Happy Birthday, according to the Guinness Book of Records is the most sung song in the world. Happy Birthday contains 16 words, of which only two are not repeated many times.  In fact it has only six unique words.  Part of the ease of understanding comes with repetition.<br /><br />Green Eggs and Ham has about 60 unique words and 500 to 600 words overall, very cleverly done, and outstanding for a child learning to read, with entertaining color illustrations on each page, great rhyme, repetition and variation and parallel structure, even reversal.<br /><br />Here is an example with parallel structure and rhyme:<br /><br />So I will eat them in a box<br />And \\" \\"  \\"  \\"  with a fox.<br />\\"  \\" \\"  \\"  \\"  in a house.<br />\\"  \\" \\"  \\"  \\"  with a mouse.<br />\\"  \\" \\"  \\"  \\"  here and there.<br />\\"  \\"  \\"  \\"  \\"  anywhere.<br />Say!

073935650X|2.0|I'm looking for another book - a different book, using the same set of situations the author outlines here.    ***Spoiler Alert***  I'm looking for the book about a new girl in town, who thinks she's found a true friend.  Then -- that list gets passed around the classroom.  That horrible, terrible list.  And everybody's laughing and joking about how her best friend is so hot, and she is not.  What a crushing experience -- to know that people think you are an ugly outcast.  Your friend, she's all upset because her name is on the list.  She's upset because people think she is hot?!?? So the new girl, the not-hot one, well, she dies a little inside, and slinks away.  She avoids the hot girl, because, well, it's just too painful. But that's not the worst, oh no...  A couple years pass - our new girl has finally recovered from the \\"not hot\\" insult, and she's getting out and being social -- going to parties.  Yay! Only she drinks too much, and stumbles into a bedroom - with a cute boy.  It's OK, though, she says no.  And he takes no for an answer.  She'll be embaressed, maybe even humiliated in the morning, but she's OK.  And then she's not.  Too drunk to defend herself, abandoned by anyone who might care about her, she is raped.  And maybe that IS the worst - but it's not the end, oh no...  It turns out someone was in the room.  Someone who could have stood up for her, could have helped her, could have called for help.  Instead they just watched and listened.    And, in a final, terrible betrayal, the watcher makes these tapes.  She describes what happened to our girl in the bedroom that night -- and things that our girl is only barely able to begin facing are laid out, raw and plain as day.  On those tapes the watcher is explaining how our girl's actions are one of the reasons the watcher, the former friend, commits suicide.    This would be a horrific scene, if the suicidal girl had confronted the raped girl in private.  But that's not what happened, oh no...  The suicidal girl describes our girl's night of horror on tape and then sends it out to thirteen people -- friends, acquaintances, oh gods, even a teacher get to listen to it.  She sends it to the rapist.  Because somehow, this is all about her.    Now there is nowhere the raped girl can hide.  Everyone knows.  They look at her funny.  Come up to her with subtle (or not so subtle) offers of help.  Even worse, the cruder and ruder among the high school scene joke about it.  About how she \\"wanted it\\".  How, since she was drunk, she was \\"asking for it\\".    Was it her fault her former friend committed suicide?  Did her rape, her night of horror, send this other girl over the edge?    ******  That's the really compelling story - the real tragedy here.  That's the book I wish this had been.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I usually never leave reviews, even for products I feel are worthy.  Words cannot describe the love I have for this headset.<br /><br />Built in 7.1 surround sound, crystal clear mic, memory foam comfort, excellent noise isolation, programmable buttons that can be configured to launch any program (Ventrilo? Skype? Winamp? Windows Media Player?), and an easy to use volume adjuster.<br /><br />I play A LOT of video games and I like to soak in after long days at work with music.  I feel like sound quality is on a whole new level compared to my previous headset and that because of the surround sound per ear, it actually sucks you in the music.<br /><br />I hesitated purchasing this headset because of the hefty $100+ price range but I could never be happier!

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I agree that Syfy has disapointed it fans by not completing its series and leaving us hanging. Its not fare that we support them by watching their shows we get hooked on them and they dont even finish them. Im am a big syfy fan but if they do it again with the next show i have started watching i am done with them.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|The idea is appealing: Just use your finger to write notes. For that to be better then typing, the app must be very responsive and sensitive. That, unfortunately, is where this app fails. When I try to draw letters, the app does not respond quickly or with great precision. As a software engineer myself, I recognize the Android platform and phone hardware (HTC Thunderbolt, in my case) play a significant role, but as a consumer I also know the only thing that matters is the end result. In this case, the result is a &quot;keyboard replacement&quot; that's actually significantly harder to learn and use. I'm assuming that with lots of practice you could become proficient. But, you can definitely do so with the keyboard and it has far greater utility. Bottom line: Save yourself the hassle and learn to use the keys. They work.
B005LMEB8E|2.0|Go back to pop rock. Don't give into the media, Demi. We know you're a rocker at heart and always will be.   All the rnb songs suck, except All Night Long.  Gave it a 2/5 since I liked a few songs:  All Night Long  Lightweight   Unbroken  Fix a Heart  Skyscraper  Mistake   For The Love of a Daughter  But compare it to her old albums, where I liked ALL songs... yeah. Stick to pop rock. This cheesey RNB sell-out crap for the sake of \\"getting with the times\\" is so overrated. Be true to yourself Demi.   Hope the next album doesn't disappoint.
B004H6OWU2|3.0|It's a bit ironic that the title of Katy B's latest album is \\"On a Mission,\\" because after you listen to the music, it feels as if she's still stuck on the launch pad.  Overall, she comes across as a poor man's Lisa Stansfield.  A few of the songs stand out more than others, but most never really go anywhere.  She's a pretty good singer, but there's not much that's distinctive about her vocals.  As a result, she sounds rather anonymous.  And while her songs are professionally produced and pleasant, most fail to make a lasting impact.  Even her hits fall kind of flat.  \\"Katy on a Mission\\" is an interesting song, but the chorus isn't that accessible.  \\"Witches' Brew\\" is probably the catchiest thing on the album, but even it isn't as catchy as a lot of tunes on the radio.  Among the rest of the songs, \\"Broken Record\\" is pretty enjoyable.  There's nothing really wrong with this album; however, it just doesn't live up to the hype.  It all ends up sounding a bit like background music and lacks electricity.  Next time, maybe Katy & crew will fill up the gas tank with enough powerful songs to make it into orbit.  ;)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|this will be short but i really loved this movie really kind of touched you with some of the characters and their ends and some the continuing of their lives. this is a great movie of you were a around the characters age you can almost grow up with them ijt would be nice to see a continuing of the story but it ended great and that maybe all that matters they did this movie the right way i know not all the movies stuck true to the books but this is a great movie i will be getting it when it comes out.

B004XNGKBS|5.0|Being a simple note pad is a necessary thing for a smartphone. This app is great because it allows you to write your own notes in your own handwriting and then scales the word down to fit reasonably on the note sheet. Definitely easier than fiddling with a touch screen keyboard. Love it! The widgets of notes you've taken is a nice feature. Works like it says it does on my HTC Evo 4G. I am pleased with this app.

0307387178|3.0|Let me start by saying that I was super excited to read this book, after seeing the movie. I was hoping for much more insight into his character and the things he did. However, this book contains little information that is not in the film. Plus the author seems to take the opportunity to boast of his experiences, which add nothing to the story line, and merely adds bulk to an already short book. Seriously the movie is much better and accurate for the most part.

1932907009|2.0|I know I'm late to the party, but why all the hoopla about Blake Snyder's SAVE THE CAT?   I read it and thought it was pretty lame.  The \\"catalyst,\\" \\"inciting incident,\\" whatever you want to call it HAS TO GO ON PAGE 12! Not page 11, not 13, not 5 -- it has to go on page 12.  Did Puzo and Coppola know that when they penned THE GODFATHER? I know THE GODFATHER was no STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT but still it was a decent movie.    There has to be exactly 40 scenes in a movie, no more, no less. Who, besides Blake Snyder, says so?  I think there might be a bit of memorializing going on here. I'm not sure how much time passed between the book's publication and Mr. Snyder's death, but it often happens that when people die young or in mid-career they are often remembered as perhaps much better than they really were.   To paraphrase Rick Blaine (in another decent movie that doesn't really stick to the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet), \\"He got a lucky break. Yesterday he was a hack writer. Today he's the honored dead.\\"  I really found the book to be nothing but a rehash of every other book on screenwriting.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Opeth fans everywhere have been split into two camps: those who revel in the ever-evolving genius of Akerfeldt and company, and those who decry this latest offering as a watered-down, weak, steaming pile.  While I am firmly in the first camp, I can say without bias that if nothing else, this controversy is a sign of something big. The game has changed. Rules have been broken. Risks have been taken. And the result is nothing short of beautiful.  Any Opeth fan who's been paying attention knows that M.A. is a huge fan of Camel, a 70s prog rock band. Recent interviews have revealed that Mikael had grown tired of the rut he'd fallen into, and was ready for something new. \\"Watershed\\" started us down that path, and now something new we've gotten indeed; and while \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\" remain on my desert island disc list, I couldn't be more pleased.  This record is a story, like all its predecessors, but with some serious changeups. Before I'd heard this album, friends had told me that all death metal elements had been discarded, and I was disappointed. Then I heard it for myself. As a fan of tech metal, prog rock, and jazz fusion, I was blown away. And it's not just an amalgamation or reinvention--it's still 100% Opeth, which is the really mystifying part. There is something simply magical about it. The engineering and mix on this is so huge, and yet so stripped down--it's like watching them quiety sweating it out at Carnegie Hall, while your face melts all the same.  I won't speak to individual tracks, although I certainly have my favorites--suffice it to say that this is an opus that works best from beginning to end. It is magnificent, and I believe it is a massive and successful enough endeavor that it truly is a game-changer. If this record doesn't make it on any given top 10 releases of 2011, it's a travesty. And anyone who can't tell the difference between \\"Heritage\\" and \\"Damnation\\" is just another \\"fan\\" that whoops and hollers during the melodic partsat concerts, salivating over the next blast beat.   Blast beats and growls will not be heard here. There has been a sea change. I'd been anxiously awaiting the next \\"Blackwater Park\\" for months, and what I got was light years beyond it. If you love good music, this is for you.

1416550550|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but there were a lot of story lines that they didn't fully develop or that were dropped entirely.
B000PTYUQG|4.0|To have the full retrospective of Stravinsky's works is interesting from a simple historical point of view. The complete work of a composer that covers the first half of the 20th century and a little bit more, who was Russian originally, migrated to Paris where he worked with the Ballets Russes, and then later to the USA where he had a full career as director and composer is definitely a treat. These works being directed by Stravinsky himself are as close as close can be to the vision of the Maestro. There are even some rehearsals directed by the composer and these are also interesting to see his very exhaustive exactingness.<br /><br />There is definitely a complete unity in style.<br /><br />But the ballets he composed a the beginning of his career taking and tackling musical raw material from Russia essentially and partly from France has a vigor and a creativity that I feel he will hardly equal in the rest of his essentially American career. Many of the pieces of the later years are adapted if not fitted to the American public who likes rather simple things and some good understandable explanations in standard English, especially if the work is in Latin for example. We can wonder why Sophocles' play, Oedipus Rex, is in Latin: it should be in Greek. And why the commentary by Jean Cocteau is not in French which is its original language. I must admit that the clarity of Cocteau's language is lost in English, though the Latin anachronism was in the original adaptation by Cocteau.<br /><br />But this adaptability of Stravinsky to the public he targets in a very commercial manner in a way traps his eventual originality and creativity in some median region that is definitely more American than Russian, and in American music more middle of the way than research. But apart from this remark I must say that Stravinsky always had the best orchestras and musicians and knew how to direct them so well that the result is very entertaining and inspiring music to listen in the peace of your home, at night or not, in a deep armchair.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnot, in a deep armchair.

Fan or newcomer, this must be heard and enjoyed - but it is not background music - it requires your full attention to be fully appreciated.  Buy it!
B005C5A66G|4.0|Yeah here we go.  Another back story of a fan's history with Machine Head.  I was about 14 when I bought The Burning Red and Burn My Eyes. What a mix right?  Well anyway, I loved both of them.  I didn't listen to Korn or Slayer or anything like that.  I just liked the way Machine Head did things.  These days I'm in my twenties and avoid metal completely. But I always keep in touch with Machine Head's releases.<br /><br />That is out of the way now.  Let me say.  This album will or has pissed people off.  I hope it has.  The amount of reviews mentioning and comparing the Blackening pisses me off.  The people who also stumbled 'unto' the band wagon from 1994 (Excuse the terrible pun) have pissed me off.  Stop comparing.  Burn My Eyes was great.  The Blackening was great.  Move on.<br /><br />Unto The Locust begins with 'I Am Hell'.  This song ruins my head every time I hear it.  There is melody there.  But no singing whatsoever.  The drums are killer.  Classic Machine Head.  Don't be put off by the classical style written song title. It isn't a pretentious track in anyway.  Might I add, some of Robb's best in the vocal department.<br /><br />Be Still And Know comes next.  It follows nicely.  It is their formula.  Shorter and catchier song after.  It works.  The drums are fast and tight.  Not too much new going on here though.  However, it is probably the most popular among fans.  Or so I have read....<br /><br />Locust is pretty radical.  Releasing this song was a bad move in my opinion.  Or releasing any song for the matter.  This song is much better in context with the album.  Guitars sing throughout and the bass lines are leading them through with some delicious fills. Good song.<br /><br />This Is The End.  Wow.  This could be my favorite.  Maybe.  The intro is real nice.  lead guitars in the intro sound kinda like Ratatat guitars.  Now you cannot hear that!! Haha!  But This is really heavy and melodic.  Backing vocals from Duce sound killer.  Robb sounds really angry.  More than ever.  Guitars again are just silly good.<br /><br />Darkness Within.  This is like in my mind.  If all the good parts of The Burning Red and Through The Ashes Of Empires were extracted and put into a song stylistically.  This song also could be my favorite.  This song will piss people off.  If I had to explain Machine Head to a friend.  I'd play this for them.<br /><br />Pearls Before The Swine comes next.  Kind of like an afterburner from the Blackening.  It is really awesome though.  The riffage doesn't change 100 times which is really refreshing.  But this is that song where the dudes get their rocks off.  Awesome melodic middle section.  Thrashy and raw.<br /><br />Who We Are is my least favorite song on the album.  It is still awesome though.  The Children singing will piss people off.  I'm not really a fan of it to be honest.  Mainly the jolting change to metal after the intro puts me off.  I do however think that it is the weakest song on the album throughout it's entirety though .  Awesome string arrangement though at the end which kind of redeems it for me.<br /><br />There we go.  Not perfect, but a really good listen.  Worth buying guys.  Downloading is for chumps. 8.5 is my true opinion.ly good.  Darkness Within.  This is like in my mind.

0553381695|4.0|This review will have spoilers so I'm stating that at the start.  It could have been a 5 star except halfway through I see why so many have complained about Robb not being a PoV character like every other member of his family is except baby brother Rickon. In AGoT, it wasn't as clear since Catelyn was at Robb's side for most of what Robb did. So the readers got things Robb did from his mother's PoV. However, in this book she gets sent away to speak with Renly. Then suddenly in a Sansa chapter we get hit with Robb winning a battle. I was as wondering as Sansa was why Joffrey was so angry and like Sansa I first thought he discovered her plan of escape. All I can say is HBO will be screwed in season 2 unless they make the creative change of making Robb a PoV character and show what he does.  About that point I started to not care about the book and skipping chapters. Theon? REALLY? Robb doesn't get promoted to a PoV but Theon does? I read the first couple of his chapters then discovered I was bored with him. So bored that I saved the next one with him for later when I had a case of insomnia for a few nights. Then that Theon chapter solved the insomnia as I was asleep in no time.  Now going back a step, I have a major issue with Arya. Everything in the book makes it seems as if almost a year had pass since Eddard was killed. Statements like \\"it's been 10 months\\" and other things like characters all a year older. However, she hasn't even gotten close to Winterfell. It takes months to travel from Kings Landing to Winterfell? Yet someone made it to Kings Landing from the Wall in less time as one of the Tyrion chapters showed.  There's plotholes that have to be ignored in this book. It's a good book but not as good as the first in my opinion. HBO which is what introduced me to this series better make changes or season 2 might be their \\"jumping the shark\\" moment. While it's a good book, translation to the screen will be lacking because viewers will just get a lot of talkingand not much action except from Arya and Jon. And just hear about most of the real action which we would have gotten if the readers were given Robb.  Edit: Yesterday I found a site that showed the new faces for season 2. And it shows how HBO sees Robb being so little used as in the readers seeing his part of the story that HBO is bringing in a character we shouldn't be seeing yet. That character is heavily involved in Robb's story but not in this book. As a matter of fact this particular character isn't even in this book at all. Plus some names not in the book but are guessed to be same characters with different names (a Lannister cousin and another character's sibling). So apparently, HBO is making more changes next season.

0439023491|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your seats because this is a wild ride.  If you enjoyed the \\"Hunger Games,\\" then you will definitely enjoy this fine work.  I really think Collins picked up well where \\"Hunger Games\\" left off and ran with it so well.  A whole new cast of characters are introduced, some you love and some you hate.  We see Katniss develop into a woman as must overcome more adversity and make decisions that are truly life and death.<br /><br />All I have to say is if the Hollywood ruins this series and turns it into \\"Twilight,\\" I will forever be hurt.<br /><br />A very easy read for people of all ages.  Took about a day to finish and now I'm about to finish the series later tonight with \\"Mockingjay.\\"  Great price too, was about $4 less than Target and no tax. Booyah.

The way the banks and large trading houses were manufacturing a false marekt was truly unbelieveable and yet unfortunately true.  I do not have a financial/banking background, but with a little logic it was very plain to see that what they were doing was plain wrong.  They guys in this book that were betting against this market were very smart, but in the end they just took the time to understand what was going on, applied a little common sense and made it seem so simple.  Definintely recommend this book to anyone!!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|This film had a few fine moments but the overall effect of this film was tedium. frank langella potrays the same old evil man. january jones is wooden. liam does his usual superb job but it is not enough to save this weak effort
B004G25V9S|3.0|But I don't hate it. It's new material from Opeth. I know this. They're only one of the greatest bands to ever come into existence. And when I really think about it, I do not think I am a close-minded metal head fanatic. With open arms and ears I accept bands who've been typecast into one genre, only to one day branch out and expand their sound with new ideas and directions. But for goodness sakes, there really isn't any other group of musicians that could equal these guys in what they've done over the years. Label me the fan boy, but it's like they haven't written a bad song in their entire career! And even when they somewhat threw people for a whirl with \\"Damnation\\" being all calm and serene, fans could still find reasons to like that album and know Opeth will bounce back into their signature aggressive sound eventually. But, haven't we been told the bands intention is to go in this direction from now on? Look, this album from start to finish is written VERY well. It isn't garbage. Actually I'm listening to it as I write this and it does has some really beautiful moments. But, all this really needed to feel like the Opeth most of us love is a little darkening up, and YES adding some of those growls in there. Because the harsh vocals are all gone, and there are no heavy crazy moments, to me it just feels like Heritage never really reaches its full peak. As an OPETH album. If you can somehow wipe out of your mind what this bands previous achievements of glory are, then I think it's easy to find a love this this album. Final words, not garbage, written well, only wish it was darkened up a bit to give that familiar sound I've grown accustomed too. I'll keep listening to this as the year goes on. It's still worth buying and giving a chance.

B005DKLPF6|5.0|Originally my review was much lengthier, but I've read too many complaints about how readers don't like looking at reviews that compare a bands back catalog to their newest material.  So I'll only say this regarding other Mastodon albums; to me, every new album they out is their best, and I (at the time) can't imagine how they could possibly surpass it. But they've done it every time! This is no exception. Originally the youtube uploads of \\"Curl of the Burl\\" or \\"Black Tongue\\" did cause some deep concern in me thinking they had watered down their complexity and were becoming downright radio friendly. Not so! After listening to this beastly behemoth last night, as a long time fan of this wonderful band, I can confidently say this is the best thing they've done. YES, I hate it when record companies plug a band of theirs with that stupid and cliche label. But this time it's really true. Best Mastodon album to date. Granted, the songs are shorter than other albums (this is more on par with Call of Mastodon in that aspect), and there isn't quite as much growling as some fans may like, and it also isn't a concept album. BUT, big but! Believe me when I say my face did a genuine sad face when this CD came to an end. It's that good. 5 stars all around with my only complaint being it all ended too soon. I even muttered under my breath as \\"The Sparrow\\" came to a close; \\"well done, Mastodon. Well done.\\"
B004G600A4|5.0|Fabulous DVD--am so amazed at the animation process that makes the characters so life-like!  Our grandchildren love the magic just as we did with Snow White and Lady and the Tramp.  DVD arrived on time in excellent condition!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Although my review title may be corny, Own the Night from Lady Antebellum, is far from that. I thankfully stumbled over Lady Antebellum a few years ago after a recommendation from a friend. Their first two albums turned into a selection of anthems describing the quintessential moments of my late 20s. The relevance to what they were singing seemed to match hand in hand with the drones of daily life, dating, or the like, breaking-up, and wondering what could have been.  Thankfully Lady Antebellum satiated my ears' pallet for another collection of songs to indescribably match my experiences. Own the Night, is lively, fresh and crisp. The sound is true to previous Lady Antebellum albums, but it comes across with much more vigor and confidence. Just a Kiss instantly pulls my mind back to past moments, while We Owned the Night makes me wish for a moment as such. The ability of Lady Antebellum to create such vivid imagery with their music is astounding. Third time is the charm, proving so with this third album! Overall, a great musical experience that makes you want to see the band live!
B005G4TJUC|1.0|By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than \\"Ooh, big robots and explosions!\\" But hey, for some, that's really all you need.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the most entertaining game I have purchased to date.  well worth the. 99 spent.  Clear graphics and tricky levels.. you won't put your phone down.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I first read about The Night Circus in USA Today as being the next big thing.  They went on to compare it to Harry Potter and the Twilight series'.  I have read both series several times, and expecting that level of quality and intrigue, I was sadly let down.  I will give Morgenstern all the credit in the world for having a fantastic imagination with respect to her 'creation' of the circus, but unfortunately too many characters and not enough excitement, especially in the first half of the book, let the overall story down.  I did like the fact that she chose to use a less than usual perspective in the telling of the story, and the love story between Marco and Celia is well developed.  Overall I am very happy I chose to read this book, but to elevate it anything above average would be an inaccurate assessment in this readers opinion.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great fun. Bought it to kill time at work but now I'm playing it instead of other games. Good stuff.
1609611543|5.0|I bought this book on audible, as I'm listening to it I am realizing the truth I have always know about wheat.  I am O+ blood , type 2 fast oxidizer metabolic type, wheat doesn't digest well for me.   My Dr. advised I give up wheat from results from  both tests. I half heartily took his advise for a few years and felt somewhat better allthough  I did get rid of all my allergies from that.  After reading Wheat Belly, I  finally  gave up wheat for good 3 weeks ago and have had increased health and energy.    I would recommend this book to everyone.
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls provides a blueprint in which to build a meaningful life. Newton's scientific approach and commitment to objectivity only accentuated the message in his book, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions on what it means to be a soul inhabiting a human body. People of all faiths and backgrounds will benefit from reading this book.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is the best syfy series in the last 2 years and was very glad to get a good buy on the series dvds.
0439023521|5.0|Two years ago I finally got around to reading \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card. Prior to recently reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins, Ender's Game was the first young adult novel I read as an \\"adult\\". And while it too lived up to its reputation, by the time I got around to reading it, I was fairly intimate with the plot, characters, setting, etc (there were very few surprises left). By comparison, I went into The Hunger Games with little to no expectations, untainted by the fine opinion of other readers. On a related side note, it was also the first book (outside Known Afterlife) that I read on my Kindle.<br /><br />I am a sucker for most any dystopia settings, throw in a strong but vulnerable heroine and some suspenseful action, and you pretty much \\"had me at hello\\". Suzanne Collins strikes a perfect balance of showing and describing, providing the reader just enough to stoke the edges of imagination. The pace of prose and simple but elegant writing sucked me in out the gate, finishing the book in less then a week. A week post finishing the book and I am still thinking about the story, a true measure of a great book no matter what the targeted demographic.<br /><br />I plan on reading the sequels as well adding a few more YA books to my every growing TBR list.
030726999X|5.0|My bride loved the book and will be ordering others in the future. The service in receiving it was superb and quick--highly recommend.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Backatown grooves right from the start - I've yet to meet anyone that didn't go \\"WOW!!\\" within 30 seconds of playing this record.  My personal favorite is \\"Suburbia\\" - a seriously rocking song - strong drumming, great guitar and wailing trombone like nothing I've heard before.    Can't say enough about this music - great album, great talent - this kid will go far.
B005ELZKWS|2.0|Liked Sammy's work with Van Halen and selectively his solo stuff. Love most everything Satriani has put out. Feel indifferent about the other two band members. Liked 3-4 tracks off the first Chickenfoot album to keep me interested and they still make it into my workout set list every once in a while.... My kid gloves off review of this album is not too kind. I don't hear growth so much as regression. The best two tracks on the album are Different Devil and Up Next, everything else is throw away. Different Devil is good but it sounds like something off a Hagar solo record, Up Next is the only song that reminds me the guitarist behind this album is one of the best alive. Only problem with Up Next is that I really don't want to hear Hagar's vocals on this one because the lyrics just disappoint compared to that great guitar work.  Oh well, maybe the next one will be better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is by far my most favorite game and happy it came back into the market! i wish i could have downloaded it while it was free
0061714402|5.0|This book was a great insight to a truly amazing person and heavy metal legend.  Dave makes you feel as if you're living his life right along side him in this very well written auto-biography.  A must read even if you don't like or know who Dave Mustaine is!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|and the gameplay and even some of the music is straight ripped off from the final fantasy series games of the snes years, but still a fun game and well thought out
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|muy interesante para der gratuito y mr ha sorprendido gratamente encontrar este programa para mi terminal de android ya q penssba que no existia hracias
B0057MFA42|1.0|The video and audio quality are great but it seems that they are out of sync a little on blu-ray. Recall and reissue.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This a review of the product, and not of the films, themselves.<br />-------------------------------------<br />Ah, yes. Despite the changes to the OT, half of which I could've gone without, it was a very worthwhile experience to watch all 6 films in high quality audio and video, weaknesses of the PT aside.<br /><br />Episodes 1 and II certainly have excessive dnr, but III looks excellent. The OT looks fairly good too, with some grain befitting the age of the movies. The sound is something to behold, as well, with 6.1 audio.<br /><br />With over 40 hours of extras, you'll also be quite busy, with a wealth of interviews, documentaries, deleted scenes, and more! As a fan who's never seen much of this material, it was very informing and worthwhile. Of course, several new changes have been introduced to the movies, and depending upon your views, you will either not mind or absolutely loathe them and George Lucas. As for my opinion, several of them are quite egregious, but do not detract from my overall enjoyment of the films.<br /><br />In the end, if you're a fan or just a casual person who happens to like Star Wars, this may be the set for you, unless those new changes really bother you.<br /><br />p.s.: I also would have loved having the original, unaltered trilogy in high definition, as well!
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Great product.  I'm sure mine was just a random case, but after only a week of use the microphone kept cutting out!  Thankfully I was able to return the product and I purchased the PX3 wireless headset.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|This app is quite simplistic for three dollars. This should be a free app or a one dollar app at best. The developers should developers lower the price or make it free.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|I purchased this product for my son with special needs.  He was sooo excited about it when he opened it up for his birthday, I thought he was going to crawl out of his skin.  After 1 hour it broke and becuase I purchased it over a month before his birthday I can not send it back for a complete refund.  I hope the company makes their products more durable because it could be an awsome toy.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
B005974C94|2.0|This album is in the style of dixie land jazz. If you are not a big fan of dixie land jazz (not many people are this century) then I would avoid this album. Unfortunately, Mr. Clapton feels anything he can record quickly from a concert and package it a 'blues' album will sell. It worked on me - I bought the album based on my respect and love of Clapton's music - without listening to samples. I will never do that again.  I felt Clapton playing dixieland was about as authentic as Louis Armstrong playing 'White Room' or Hendrix belting out a Cole Porter tune.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|just downloaded today as the free app of the day. so far, two hours into the game, its pretty good. seems kinda simple but the playing time has flew by. no large download, or pressing 3d graphics, but I would recommend it, and would def pay for a 2nd one if they make one
B004OHFM44|5.0|Well I want it clear-- the book I ordered from Amazon never came... so I bought it at B&N for my son's English class. Albom is an incredible writer. This book touched my son, who has his own significant health issues. Like listening to Last Lecture, this book makes you think about what is important in life. Its short. It has interesting points. Its a book to read and think about.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|I have to say that I was very excited when I heard this album was coming.  Finally, Eddie Vedder was going to put together an album to complement the Into the Wild soundtrack.  Unfortunately, it might complement the album too well.<br /><br />This album is a nice collection of acoustic style songs with Eddie Vedder and a Ukelele (duh!) and it is a nice mix of songs including a Pearl Jam song and covers.<br /><br />For the most part I love it, just as I loved Into the Wild, but just as in that soundtrack, my biggest disappointment here is that the album is short.  I know it shouldn't matter, but whereas a soundtrack can obviously be constrained by its movie, I really wanted this album to be filled with songs that I felt were full songs.  However, I feel that as good as all the songs here are, they feel incomplete at times.<br /><br />Besides the length of the album, the songs are fantastic although it doesn't have the stand out songs that really made the Into the Wild soundtrack a 5-star album (Hard Sun comes to mind there).  I don't think a listener who liked that album would be disappointed at all, but if you didn't like that album, don't expect this to be something you'll love.  The inclusion of a Pearl Jam song, probably won't make the difference for those Pearl Jam fans who didn't like Into the Wild.  But, if you love Ukelele music, and you love a folk-music type sound, you just might like it even if you've never heard of Eddie Vedder before.  The best test maybe to give the standard, Dream a Little Dream a listen.<br /><br />Almost everyone knows that song, and while it makes a fantastic end to the album, for those evaluating the album for a purchase, this is a great song to start with.
B001PPGAK8|4.0|why do you make leaving a review such a pain. let me have the option to just do the stars and be done.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Great movie good story its about Bruce Lee's teacher.If you like martial arts you will love this movie.This movie does have subtitles however it does play in english.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I received my order in record time--in good condtion  Thanks for the prompt service! I enjoy using Amazon and suggest to my friends that they do the same
B003VR5PPY|3.0|Game looks very good, sometimes scary, lots of adolescent talk in it about science. Although not all, lots of puzzles are about using the right combination of figures. A minus is that several ends are possible and to achieve them, you have to start several times all over at the beginning.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Have wanted this game for a while, but have vowed to never buy an app, especially a game. So I was stoked to see it as the FAOTD, hooray Amazon! This is an addictive game that outshines Angry Birds, in my opinion. Works great on my Verizon Samsung Facinate.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Buying these upgrades (that's really what they are) was well worth my money, as a big fan of the original games.   The immersive quality that HD has added to the already superb, atmospheric PS2 graphics is very intense, moreso than most games designed for the PS3. These are games for which you bring your chair up as close to your big HDTV as you dare, because of the gorgeous (but never garish) eye-candy, and the feeling of really being there even though the perspective is 3rd-person.  It's worth mentioning that subtle game-play issues have been upgraded as well as the graphics. Notably, a few of the battles in ICO are tougher than they were, and at least one of the puzzles has been significantly improved.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Mastodon has done it again! Another fantastic album full of a perfect mix of both heavy and gentle sounds throughout the entire album. I can't stop listening!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app takes the greatness of the original angry birds adds even better graphics. Thanks Rovio for another awesome app. :D
0385493622|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my husband on the recommendation of a friend.  It's day two and he's not putting it down.  A great, compelling read for those with an interest in both history and math.
B005DZMP00|5.0|a lot of people have commented that packaging is cheap and flawed. Its actually laid out identically to the original. Including the upside down artwork and print on back cover, which i think is pretty cool. If you open the original vinyl release it's just 3 blank pages. There's a booklet w some pics from the tour and essential info included w cd's. For 2 full length cd's costing $10 i'd say its a great deal. The song selection is very nice, but obviously there's no \\"new\\" original GD material on these discs. Those songs were all on the original release. Sound quality is consistent w the original cd release and they're some great performances here. IMO anything from this era is worth picking up. Enjoy the music, you won't be disappointed.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Awsome book.  I love the description of London in the early days.  This is a series of cases / short stories that are separate stories, but in the context of the book are all part of the big story.  They are well written and entertaining.  Stands the test of time.
B004UID2LC|2.0|App was working perfectly until the recent 9/28 update. I was able to download 3 songs earlier in the day but in the evening the app just wouldn't even search for a song. In the Android Market it says this app has been removed from the market so I'm thinking that these problems have something to do with YouTube licensing rather than the app itself. Either way, it didn't start causing problems until the latest update. Plz fix this because this is (was) a great app that I used daily.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Don't know why mine stopped working all of a sudden. Galaxy Tab. Ill still give it a high score though.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I'm not big on downloading games but when I saw this one and it was the Free App of the day I said, Why not? Really good graphics and the fact that you can probably play this over and over again and not really get bored is a plus.
1609611543|5.0|I'm not a health nut, but I'm becoming one. I came across this book after testing my blood sugar levels on a hunch - incorrect as it turned out - that low blood sugar was causing mid-afternoon grogginess. Nope - I had very high glucose levels after meals, and only after meals. My doctor ordered blood tests, and those came back normal. So I'm OK: it had to be something in my diet.  That something turned out to be wheat. Glucose levels spiked most severely after wheat-containing meals. Even high-sugar desserts didn't come close to the wheat-fueled levels. Nor did products made from other high-carb products like corn, rice, or potatoes.  I picked one of the low-carb diets out there and tried it. What a difference! Daytime alertness is up, sleep is deeper and of shorter duration, I wake up refreshed, do not get the late morning or afternoon \\"blahs,\\" and have lost significant weight - nearly ten pounds in the first month.   Dr Davis makes a good case that people gain weight, and then cannot lose it, not because of gluttony or sloth, or insufficient willpower, but because a supposedly healthful food that we eat in great quantity works against us.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I had purchased this cd for a friend who is crazy about Adele. I  myself have heard the cd and give it a favorable review. Some of the songs will take some getting used to. I guess if you play music enough you grow to like it...
B003UESJ9M|3.0|I loved this movie and all the songs so I ordered the CD.  Very disappointed with the CD as some of the songs were not from the movie.  In the movie I especially loved Give In To Me - the duet.  On the CD Faith Hill sings it.  Wish they would have stuck to the orginal songs from the movie.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Unless i'm blind, there is no in-game volume control.  It's either sounds on or off.  The volume control on the HTC Incredible controls ringtone volume in-game, not media volume.  A bummer.  Otherwise, very enjoyable.
B0043UGKAM|2.0|I was interested in this series because I love history and thought that this would be an accurate representation of the rebellion led by Spartacus and how the rebellion came to be, though I admit I know next to nothing about it other than what I saw in the 1960 epic Spartacus. The first minute really said it all: coarse language. I personally have no problem with profanity (I use it almost any chance i get), but I don't think that kind of vocabulary was used in Ancient Rome. The sex I had no problem with either. The scenes with Spartacus and his wife had beautiful music and were well-filmed. I like how Spartacus really cared about her and said that throughout. My other problem with this episode was also with the obvious CGI backgrounds and CGI blood, which looked like something out of the erroneous and pseudo-\\"Historical drama\\" 300. Skip this.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Along with the recent filming of Bleak House, Little Dorrit is the best of the many film adaptations of Charles Dickens' novels.  Until seeing Bleak House and Little Dorrit, I believed that filming Charles Dickens was all but impossible, and I was always very disappointed, whether it was a BBC production or a Hollywood extravaganza.  Now I can hope for great adapations of Dickens' other great novels as well.
B0043UCWA4|1.0|Having seen the first episode of this series, and put off by the vulgar language (not because I don't use it, but because I don't think they spoke like that in Ancient Rome or in ancient times, for that matter), obvious CGI backgrounds and CGI-style blood a la 300, I decided to give it another shot. The second episode is even worse: in addition to the profanity and CGI backgrounds and blood, this episode also includes vulgar sexual references that you'd expect to hear in \\"Two And A Half Men,\\" \\"Family Guy\\" and \\"The Sopranos.\\" Also, the guy who plays Varro resembles the silent Marx Brother (I think his name is Harpo). Unnerving, in addition to the rest of this garbage. Skip this one too...ah, skip the entire series. It's a waste of time. I'm not even sure how bloody accurate the series is to history.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|I have a rooted nookcolor - ironically.  And I can't stand the nookapp.  I use this (along with Aldiko) to read all of my epubs.  I prefer this one.  I love all the text adjustments and the interface in general, but have two things for my wishlist....1) Ability to enter passwords to access drm content from BN or ADE (library books).  2)Dictionary and notes.  Developer take notice.  This is a sweet app, and could be my bff with a few tweaks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome app. Very addicting. Looking forward to more updates and more levels! Great addition to the other angry birds apps.
B0058VW36U|5.0|LOVE THIS APP! I'm sure it will keep the kids busy if I need a minute too. My fave strategy game! Don't start playing at 10pm... You may be up  till 1 :-)
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is fantastic and entirely skill based. There is no concern for luck and timing as there is in such games as angry birds or cut the rope.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I think it is a little more than suspicious that this app runs at startup and continues to run in the background.  I don't know what the app is doing, but it certainly isn't working OT to improve its streaming; this app is not as good as it used to be.
159514188X|5.0|This book blew my mind. It really makes you realize the impact of every word you say and how it can affect the person that you say it to. This author did a great job with this book, it changed my life. You definitely need to read it.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I haven't used this app in a week; I have restarted my device multiple times.  Someone please explain to me why this needs to run in the background. Even after I force close, it starts back up a few minutes later. It is a f$*#%g cookbook!
1401219268|4.0|This book was pretty cool. It shows humanity as it is. I agreed with one of the characters point of view, his name was Rorschach. He thought the world was terrible and full of scum. Which it is. The author did well is the story line, it has a gnarly twist in it. However, I thought the character design was lacked interest.
B005IEWUW4|5.0|Love how this series gives us a long term underlying story, with lots of good old fun sci-fi wonders in between.  This one, is super because it ties in the long story.  What, about 5 of the episodes deal with the long story - and I LOVE the other episodes in between.  Especially the Doctor's Wife, and the Almost People - the latter which is essential to the underlying story in one way.  As for the Underlying storyline - also loved Demon's Run.  When do Demon's Run? Demon's run when a good-man goes to war).
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I do not understand why people are giving bad reviews because these don't have extended cuts/3D/new extras etc...  Let's see, we have all 8 movies, in BluRay at the quality they were individually released, for $11.25 per movie.  That seems like a very good deal to me.  I'm sure there will be extended releases with bells and whistles coming out in a year or two now that the series is done.  But it takes time to put that all together.  They are not claiming to be anything more then the movies and a few extras, and for that it is perfect!
B001F0WXY0|1.0|Why is the kindle version more expensive than a hard copy?  I thought it was suppose to go the other way!  Don't get it.  Could someone explain this phenomenon.
B0058VW36U|5.0|my only complaint is that they need to make more levels pronto! dont worry it will take you a while to get through them all...
B003JOA0U4|5.0|This is the one.Solid build metal casing for heavy duty wear with keys in pocket.There is a lot of those on market but I'm impresd with this one.
B000007UEY|5.0|If you're a fan of the good old days of Genesis, you'll love this album.  It's a great mix of high energy and hypnotic trance, profound poetry and fun times, orchestral journeys and warm fuzzies.  Not a life-changing work like some of the old Genesis stuff, but still I never get tired of it.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Given that we now know exactly what Machine Head is capable of after the release of their undisputed masterpiece, 2007's \\"The Blackening,\\" every single fan's expectations for \\"Unto the Locust\\" were too high, my own included. There was no way this album could ever be as good as \\"The Blackening,\\" let alone exist anywhere but in the shadow of Machine Head's crown jewel... Except for one thing: it's better. I jest not- Machine Head has truly achieved the impossible; \\"Unto the Locust\\" is an even greater masterpiece than its predecessor.<br /><br />Everything about \\"Unto the Locust\\" is simply flawless. The guitars are crisp, fast, and heavy, Flynn's vocals are as angry and brutal as ever, but also melodic in all the right places, and McClain brings us the best performance of his career on the drum kit. Bassist Adam Duce graces our ears with his haunting backing vocals on a number of tracks, most notably on \\"This Is The End,\\" and Flynn harmonizes his own vocals in a few spots as well, which is a new tactic. Demmel and McClain can be heard a few times here and there, but for the most part they stick to their instruments.<br /><br />Despite containing only one song under six minutes in length, there isn't any filler present on \\"Unto the Locust.\\" Each song is stuffed with killer riffs; before anything has a chance to get stale Flynn and Demmel diverge into something completely different, then bring back familiar (but not always identical) melodies before diverging once again. On tracks such as \\"I Am Hell\\" and \\"Who We Are\\" Flynn utilizes his classical guitars, and Demmel employs some interesting effects on the breakdown riff in \\"This Is The End.\\" Just as on \\"The Blackening,\\" Machine Head achieves a vast amount of musical complexity without making the album unlistenable, which is always a complicated feat.<br /><br />There is not a dull moment on \\"Unto the Locust,\\" let alone a bad track. Machine Head really knocked it out of the park with this album, and frankly, I'm still in awe. My expectations for \\"Unto the Locust\\" could not have been more unrealistic, yet they were still exceeded. \\"Unto the Locust\\" is, simply put, a force to be reckoned with. If you don't believe me, purchase this album for yourself and enjoy the carnage first hand.<br /><br />For those of you interested in the special edition extras:<br /><br />If you spring for the special edition you're going to get a great cover of Judas Priest's \\"The Sentinel,\\" a decent cover of Rush's \\"Witch Hunt,\\" an acoustic version of \\"Darkness Within\\" which is well worth the extra money, and \\"The Making of Unto the Locust\\" documentary, which is interesting but (and this is my only complaint about the entire package) only clocks in at 22 minutes. It could easily have been twice as long and still been quite entertaining.the Locust\\" could not have been more unrealistic, yet they were still exceeded. \\"Unto the Locust\\" is, simply put, a force to be reckoned with.

0061784788|4.0|An intrigue going back before the country's founding. Rollins takes the idea of Israelite tribes in America, drawing on founding fathers, The Book of Mormon, native language, and a race against time involving ancient treasures and secret societies.<br /><br />I enjoyed the two Sigma Force novels I read by Rollins: The Judas Strain and The Doomsday Key. The Devil Colony shares the non-stop action-propelled plot against time, a cast of heroes and villains, and fascination with ancient secrets. All tied together with compelling momentum. I was disappointed that many of Rollin's references to Mormonism and The Book of Mormon seemed so lightly researched. A Wiki search could have told Rollins enough to get the name of the church right, and the name of the founding prophet: Joseph, not John. With such glaring glitches, one has to wonder how much of the historic details and science are speculative, rather than carefully-researched. So when he turns the Holy of Holys in the Salt Lake Temple into a gilded treasure vault, well, you have to chalk a lot up to the author's fanciful imagination, rather than take it as -- should I say? -- gospel.<br /><br />The characters who populate the Sigma Force seem to be a cast of mercenaries with overlapping brawn. There is a bit of vulnerability and tender interaction that brings them back from cardboard depictions, but you get the feel the ensemble is interchangeable and are valuable for placement in distant lands to maintain shifts between cliff-hangers of the several plot lines. Still, it's a thrilling ride, and I found every moment of the reading engrossing.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|A very enjoyable RPG.  A little more documentation would be nice , but you can quickly pick up the basics. If you liked the first few FF games, you'll like this.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|First illusia then cut the rope, now this?! This is awesome! I love old school rpgs and this is a good tribute to them.   But what does it mean by &quot;play on high definition monitor?&quot; can I play on my computer?
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|I ordered this case by my mistake.  That's my fault.  I meant to order another one that I like better (and is also a few bucks cheaper).<br /><br />I much prefer the [[ASIN:B003Y74AZW AmazonBasics Silicone Case and Screen Protectors for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4]].  The other one is better and even includes Screen Protectors.<br /><br />This case is very basic.  It's not bad looking, but it only provides basic protection against dirt, the death grip, and very minor bumps.<br /><br />I highly recommend the other case over this one.
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|The jokes in this movie were obviously conceived by a bunch of wealthy studio executives sitting in an air-conditioned boardroom somewhere in L.A. They clearly wanted to appeal to as wide a demographic as possible and it shows. The animation, voice work, and production design are first rate and Johnny Depp does a fine job. The only problem with this comedy is that it simply isn't funny. The jokes are tame, wooden, and they fall flat on the floor. There's nothing unexpected and I sat stone-faced and bored through the first half. Didn't bother with the second.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|This is the best childs storyline animated movie I have seen at home. The special effects in 3D was surperb. I enjoyed it so much I bought the movie for all of my grandchildren.
B001HR5AIC|5.0|In years to come, this beautifully packaged encapsulated album is a wonderful souvenir of her short but powerful body of work. What's an added bonus is that......shhhhh! It is cheaper than Amazon's recommended pricing. So I feel rich. It really took listening to songs from \\"Frank\\", her celebrated European debut (it was only recently released here), to understand that Amy was indeed a special talent. I like the jazziness of the tracks. A little more accessible to that genre like Sade, yet, decidedly more straightforward jazz. The promo album box set arrived in a reasonable time frame as promised.   The booklet is so well done that I have it displayed in several prominent positions along with my replica of the Hitsville #1s, The Supremes pink tin box, The Beatles comprehensive collection, Aretha's Columbia album box and my Diana Ross \\"The Force Behind the Power\\" Complete Collection DVD. It is a piece that I am quite proud to showcase.  With so much music included, I haven't begun to truly absorb all of it's content. But I do look forward to doing so overtime.  I am surprised Universal is still manufacturing this piece because normally a special edition like this would be cut out a long time ago..........so I am happy I have secured my copy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|YES, I actually own this set and have watched almost every one so far (one to go maybe).<br /><br />They all look and sound outstanding and have very thoughtful extras and packaging. Resolution on a 65\\" plasma is excellent and the sound mix is definitely a few steps up from the DVD mix.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Great vocals, check.  Amazing guitar, check.  Bass, drums, well-crafted rock songs, check, check and check!  Great album, great talent, great, great band!!! How many greats is that? I don't know but however many isn't enough. Get this album.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|lots of tunes I never realized Lenny did really enjoyed the flash from the past. Again a really good album you will probably enjoy
B003L77GH4|5.0|Love this season!!! I think that any TVD fan should own this!! Great season...it just keeps getting better. You will enjoy it!! The bonus material is great too.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This dvd is played over and over and over again. It's so great, and the movie songs are catchy and the dancing is entertaining. Love everything about this movie.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I heard a lot of great things about this show, and I figured I would watch it, to give it a chance. But unfortunately, the show seems a slow primetime soap opera aimed at mostly women; strange given the setting and content therein.  This fact disappointed me quite a bit.<br /><br />Sure the production and acting is top-notch. But this is easy to do if you throw money around. The problem here is that the usual soap-opera staples are all here on display; the homewrecker that you luv to hate, the unattractive frumpy good girl that you should root for, the bad-boy lead, the nerdy loser who's only good for an one-nighter, etc.<br /><br />The reason that I've never been fond of soaps is because I find them plodding, roundabout, and generally tacky stuff. But most important, they seem to emphasize the worst in humanity. The men are pretty boy meatheads or losers with crappy self-worth and hearts of gold (but are horrible lovers), the females almost always uniformly unpleasant people and nothing ever happpens in these shows; nothing ever gets done. I must come out here and say, I fancy myself a bit of a fiction writer and I hate these stupid tropes that tv writers lean on...but it makes bucks.<br /><br />And I'm a guy that tries to give these chick-flick soaps a chance. But they never keep me around long, sadly. I'm always run off. So many great pilots of interesting dramas get bait-switched into these backstabbing snobby harpy character vehicles that no wonder I gave up on television years ago.<br /><br />I just don't like that lame tactic, in particular. Shows about simple plot, characterization and actual meaning and purpose becomes \\"he slept with her and she got mad and tried to kill him, but then they made up and then \\"A MISUNDERSTANDING\\" happened, and now she hates him again and now she cheated on him with his nerdy friend and he clammed up and couldn't satisfy her, so she went back to Bad Boy and batted her eyelashes because \\"I'M THAT HOT\\" and \\"MEN ARE EASY\\" and of course he took her back, but he was SO MAD cause he's BADBOY and he slapped her HARD in the face, and now she's gonna sue him to MAKE HIM PAY, but the lawyer is cute, so I gonna seduce the lawyer now, and get revenge (plus he's loaded!!) against BADBOY, but he finds out and Lawyer and BadBoy fistfight each other over my honor and...well, the point has been made.<br /><br />Yeesh. After a while, it's all 'bla-bla-blah'.  I just don't get it.  But it's very well produced, so you gotta give it points for that, at least.  Sigh.D cause he's BADBOY and he slapped her HARD in the face, and now she's gonna sue him to MAKE HIM PAY, but the lawyer is cute, so I gonna seduce the lawyer now, and get revenge (plus he's loaded!!) against BADBOY, but he finds out and Lawyer and BadBoy fistfight each other over my honor and...well, the point has been made.   Yeesh. After a while, it's all 'bla-bla-blah'.  I just don't get it.  But it's very well produced, so you gotta give it points for that, at least.  Sigh.
B00447L4JG|5.0|came early so my two year old can view it. She loves watching it and dances to the opening song.
0385534639|5.0|The novel accomplishes what few books are able to do: Swept you away into another ethereal world. Imaginative, whimsical, magical, with a storyline that constantly changes through the lives of the different characters, this debut novel is nothing short of perfection specially for a debut author. Thumbs Up to Erin Morgenstern, she managed to create something new out of what many people will considered cliche ideas. Overall is an amazing read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the condition, and loved how fast it came. I am very pleased overall with it and it's a great addition to my collection.
B002LFPAUC|4.0|The only reason that I don't give this a five-star rating is that the series is older. I couldn't find this at video stores. I am very please with my purchase.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|AUTHOR'S NOTE: Though this package includes an updated cut of the film, I will review the original version of it.  Spoilers will follow.<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />This is it.  The 1977 original film(paired with an 'enhanced' version of same).  Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness, \\"Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope\\" is a powerful and landmark film for generations.<br /><br />The story is a model of simplicity that suggests a multitude of intricacies and hidden meanings.  At bottom, the young man Luke Skywalker forms an uneasy partnership with a shifty ally named Han Solo to rescue a princess.  The galaxy is in the grip of a murderous Empire, led by a faceless and cruel master foot soldier named Darth Vader.  Vader is one of the great villains in popular film, in this film brought to life onscreen by two people.  James Earl Jones' voice is deep and rich, yet also icy-cold when and where it needs to be.  David Prowse wears Vader's immaculate black suit very convincingly.  Luke, Han, and Princess Leia  must manage their egos and grapple with individual responsibility and personal loss to hope to defeat the powerful dark forces, which also include a sea of white-armored StormTroopers and a ruthless evil bureaucrat played by Peter Cushing.<br /><br />The script carries a level of detail and maturity that is missing from every single prequel.  It is here that George Lucas massages the idea of lightsaber battles doubling as psychological revelations and exposition.  The dialogue between Sir Alec Guinness and James Earl Jones during a pivotal lightsaber battle is exemplary for dropping tantalizing clues at a shared past history between their characters.  The Force isn't an underdeveloped joke but an appropriate metaphor for religion and, most especially, spirituality.  Specifically, an intriguing rivalry develops between Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Han Solo.  Performances are uniformly excellent, with special mention for Sir Alec Guinness in an Oscar-nominated turn as Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi.<br /><br />If at all possible, see this movie and its immediate sequels \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" before any of the prequel movies.  This is a legendary movie, telling an engrossing story buttressed by one of John Williams' finest musical scores. The movie also features Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew as the robot twosome C-3PO and R2-D2, respectively, and Solo's large hairy growling co-pilot Chewbacca.  I love this movie.
030788743X|5.0|This is a wonderfully nostalgic, well-paced and thoroughly engrossing novel. As a high schooler who came of age in the 1980s, I highly recommend it.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Great games. Great deal. I never played either of these games on ps2. Very happy I got to experience them on ps3.  Great Sound/Music. Good Graphics. Simple but powerful stories. Controls are a little frustrating until you get some practice. OVERALL GREAT EXPERIENCE.
B000WEMH3C|2.0|Piece of junk. I had to throw it away after 2 years of use. Sunlight destroys it fast. I bought [[ASIN:B000WEOQWC Weber 7453 Premium Kettle Cover, Fits 22.5-Inch Charcoal Grills]] instead. It seems to be built to last.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Liam Neeson is always the perfect star who isn't a star. Loved him since Darkman and more recently in movies like Taken. He's not initially a tough guy in this(you kind of figured it would have to turn out that way right?), so it almos perfectly fills the void of old Harrison Ford films like Frantic and The Fugitive. The payoff doesn't have quite as much punch, though it's close. If he keeps picking them like this, he'll go into my list of must-see actors formerly populated by the like of Morgan Freeman, Johnny Depp, Bruce Willis, Leonardo DiCaprio, etc. I'm starting to like Liam Neeson as an actor so much again nowadays that Qui-gon even gets some cool points.
0786838655|5.0|This was a great book that I could enjoy reading as an adult and I know my students have enjoyed reading.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I grew up with Rush..... 1970s through current.<br /><br />My first concert seeing Rush was on Moving Pictures and I thought it was awesome! Since then I have raised a family and we have made a habit of going to see Rush whenever they tour. Most of the time we see them in St. Louis MO.  I was very lucky that I married a Geddy Corn (Google for explanation) and she and I have raised kids that love Rush. We saw the Time Machine Tour in 2010 and it was simply awesome. Getting to see the whole Moving pictures in its entirety was great. Getting to see the camera eye performed for the first time was a great as well. This band has literally written the soundtrack for my life and I have great musical respect for them and their fans. The most loyal group of fans in the music industry today.<br /><br />Bottom line The Time Machine Tour was awesome and I can't wait to see this DVD!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Gaga has done it again! This album is incredible, and I can't get enough of it! From the sick dance beats of Judas to the mellowness of The Queen, Born This Way has a wide range of sounds. Thank you Gaga for giving us an amazing album!
B00466HN6S|5.0|I absolutely adore Hop! I felt pretty silly as an eighteen year old watching this in theatres with my friend and about fifty other young ones. And I also felt like it was just going to be yet another lame child level movie. BUT With Russell Brand's Humor and the cuteness of the bunnies and other animal characters I LOVED HOP. and ive been waiting to find it in wal-marts just to find out that its not even out yet. what bologna. :(
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|good interface design for touch device.  love the movement : doesn't require digital joypad, just drag your finger in the direction you character wants to move.  If you're at edges, you could accidentally walk to the previous screen, but not that big of a deal.  If you play turn based rpg before, you should feel pretty comfortable with the battle system. The game is not too difficult at the beginning, which is great for ametur level player like myself.  Overall, with a few mins of playing, it's very entertaining!
B001EC3JME|5.0|I wasnt too sure before I got this flashlight pouch but it has done a great job for me.  Its a little snug at first but it breaks in nicely.  I use it with my Fenix ld20 and no complaints.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Definitely worth the price if it weren't free. I am definitely considering the other rpg that is advertised at the main menu.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Booooo!<br /><br />Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow  revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...<br /><br />I hope this truly helps you out, seriously..
B005DKLPF6|4.0|I received my copy of \\"The Hunter\\" earlier today and have now listened to it twice through. On the first listen I really wasn't sure how I felt about this album, especially with some of the more overtly mainstream moments (eg Creature Lives). After the second listen I began to fall in love, and as soon as I finish writing this I'm gonna listen to it again.<br /><br />No, this album is not Crack the Skye. It's not as consistently good as Crack the Skye (thus the four stars), which was a masterpiece of the highest order. But I tell you what - there are some pretty damn good songs on here - personal favorites are \\"The Hunter\\", \\"Spectrelight (f&*$ yeah Scott Kelly!)\\" and especially \\"The Sparrow\\", which is hauntingly emotional.<br /><br />I do wish that there were more awesome riffs like on past efforts, but the band has traded their earlier riff-based sound for an aesthetic based on emotive vocals and economic songwriting - and you know what? Most of the time they really make it work for them. Actually, at times during this album I wonder if touring with Deftones last year didn't influence them a bit - there are really some similarities between songs like \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"The Sparrow\\" and the songs on Deftones' \\"Diamond Eyes\\".<br /><br />I, for one, am really happy with this album overall, and I hope Mastodon's other fans are open-minded and accepting.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Like so many of the reviewers here, I was very excited to get the Blu-Ray set of the Star Wars trilogy. Luckily, I had not yet unwrapped the set but went online to read the reviews. What I found out blew me away. After watching a few of the new scenes on YouTube, I took the Blu-Ray set back to the store and never looked back. At this point, I am hoping to find a way to get a glimpse of the original theatrical versions on the bonus discs from the earlier DVD release and could care less if the quality is bad.  What I don't understand is how someone--an artist--can have such a complete disregard for his or her work. It's one thing to keep improving something while still preserving the original, but it's another to try to destroy that original, along with the growth, nostalgia and connection that it created in exchange for something of less value and quality. It's like life: you are constantly growing and developing and may end up being the person you always wanted to be. But as flawed as your past may have been, it's an integral part of you that made you who you are today, and you can't just disregard or pretend like it didn't exist.  If a famous painter got up one day and decided he didn't like the way his famous masterpiece turned out, would he remove it from the museum, redo it and then tell the world that that's the only version they would see from now on? No, because then his fans, who have loved the painting for so long, would not look at it the same way again and instead would resort to finding the original image in any way they could. This is the case with the original trilogy.  Overall, I have come to the conclusion that Lucas is really a poor, tasteless director with no artistic sense or integrity. When the original trilogy came out, there were other decision-makers involved in the making of the movies, and because of their advice, which I am sure included the vetoing of some of Lucas' decisions, the trilogy was a success. On the other hand, once the creativecontrol went back to Lucas, the quality started diminishing. We saw that quality in the horror that is the so-called prequel trilogy, as well as the continuous changes that are always being made to the original trilogy. Has he ever received an Oscar for his work as a director? I don't think so.  For me, the biggest problem with the current so-called \\"original trilogy\\" version of Star Wars is not the audio or color tweaks, not the insertion of deleted scenes or improvements to CGI, but the continuous effort to shove the prequels down everyone's throats. All this tying-in between the six movies has really gotten out of hand. As much as I dislike the new changes (dragon call, Greedo, Ewok, etc.), I really can't stand the replacement of Shaw by Christenssen in ROTJ. That, right there, is the worst case of tampering with the past. Though the \\"no\\" is bad enough, I am now reading something about the de-masking of Darth Vader, where, once again, Shaw's face is digitally altered to include no eyebrows and a closer resemblance to young Anakin. That's all, brother.  George Lucas can go on and on about how these Star Wars films are his, and how the franchise is his creation; however, viewers are the ones spending the money (well, not anymore) and investing their time in this series. And if Lucas keeps on going at the pace he is now, he will wind up being the only one watching them.
B0058VW36U|5.0|First off this game is the bomb!!!! I remember downloading it from amazon for free and for some reason its gone and I can't get it back (for free) so I've been waiting for it to pop up for free again. But I just happen to check it today and its in the free column....but it still says 99 cents. Now I'm not one to complain over 99 cents but free is free. C'mon son :)
B00004XPPE|5.0|I've seen this film many times, along with Dr. Strangelove and The Bedford Incident.  Although each film in its own way raises goose bumps of fear in this viewer, and always has, Failsafe is one film that comes closest to  what might have transpired had the Cuban Missile Crisis (at about the same time) reached a fatal conclusion - WORLD WAR III AND TOTAL NUCLEAR CATASTROPHY!  Some people and reviewers believe the movie is somewhat dated - a product of the times, the times - of course - being The Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union...I strongly disagree!  Today, more than ever - despite a large drawdown on both sides of nuclear missile stockpiles - we must be ever vigilant against something like this occurring!  True, the major powers are well aware of the catastrophic consequences should any side choose to start a nuclear holocaust, or should it happen by mistake (a more likely scenario...or is it!), but the terrorists who managed an  incredible holocaust on a grand scale (if you were a victim or a family member of a victim of 9/11, you'd agree, I'm sure, that is WAS on a grand scale!) on 9/11 are no fools!  More and more we must  be alert to new contacts made by any of several murderous terrorist organizations with nuclear powers like Pakistan and upcoming ones like North Korea!  Small nuclear devices smuggled out of these countries, and fanatical  nuclear scientists who agree with \\"Jihad\\" against the West who willingly volunteer to help smuggle out, prep and prime small nuclear devices, and the underling terrorist dogs who crave \\"Paradise\\" by sacrificing themselves in blowing these things up in, let's say in a major U.S. hub city - a port, for example - are  the real dangers we must be wary of.    AND THIS INCLUDES \\"AMERICAN JIHADISTS\\" BORN AND BRED IN \\"THE LAND OF THE FREE\\" WHO ARE RECRUITED INTO TERRORIST RANKS BY AL QAIDA SPEECHES OR VIDEOS SMUGGLED INTO OUR COUNTRY!  We just saw a very small attempt on the part of an American Muslem (just look at the name!) who studied Physics at Northwestern and built large electronic model planes designed to hold massive amounts of explosives and rigged to fly into the Pentagon and Capitol buildings!  This, and the Oklahoma bombing, alone should be a warning sign, as this movie (and the other two great movies mentioned, as well!) was...AND STILL IS!  If you haven't seen Failsafe, Dr. Strangelove, or the Bedford Incident - get 'em all in updated DVD format!  Even the hilarious  Peter Sellers in a three-part role in Dr. Strangelove is \\"scary as hell!\\".    Even if you only want to watch three great movies with great screenplays, actors, and scenarios, and - of course, great directors - you will NOT be disappointed.  And, if you're like me,  you WILL be \\"scared as hell\\" at what could happen in the not-too-distant future!  And, as they say, \\"The rest is history\\"!
6303444202|1.0|Old VCRs clearly don't age well, even if in \\"factory-original\\" packaging. Will be getting a DVD. Picture trembles like it has Parkinson's Disease until the very end of the show, which is when you find out how great the show you just got seasick from actually was. I've got to see this show in well-preserved media

B004AFFZNI|5.0|I bought the skeleton housing for my GoPro HERO because I wanted to be able to both protect the main body of the camera from damage and have the benefit of improved audio recording through the open spaces of the housing.  This product delivered as expected.  My main intention is to use my GoPro to record my paintball games from my perspective, including the on field sounds.  one might imagine that having parts of the camera may be dangerous, but I never once got a direct hit on the camera, and all splatter was to the top and front sides of the housing.  The camera is regard, regardless, and so long as the lens and buttons are protected, I expect even a shot to the sides wouldn't do any real damage, but don't take my word for it.  Either way, the housing worked as promised, as the video looked great and I can hear the voices of other players and sounds of paintball markers firing just fine, without the usual distortion the fully enclosed housings often bring to their recorded audio.
B001BK9MWA|5.0|I see some have gone quite into depth, so I'll keep this short and simple: As a long-time fan of heavy, prog, melodic, and death metal genres since the early 80's, Ihsahn's angL is exactly what I've been yearning for for the past few years.  Ihsahn does screaming and clean vocals in more or less equal measures while successfully combining some Emperor influences (obviously) with prog metal. Asgier Mickelson provides a perfectly suited percussive backbone for this piece of work.  I would feel silly picking a favorite from this album, as each song is a unique gem. Yet the album is incredibly coherent. Every song is captivating in its own way, and once you hit play you're in it 'till the end. There are no \\"singles\\" on this one, it's all or nothing. And in my opinion, it's all extremely good.  Listen to a sample and if you enjoy it then you'll probably love this album.
1401223176|4.0|Beautiful artwork, story was so-so, entertaining but not the best I have ever read.  I did not feel for the characters the same way that I did for Batman: Year One.  All in all, a worthwhile read.

1594202842|4.0|\\"The mother loves her child most divinely, not when she surrounds him with comfort and anticipates his wants, but when she resolutely hold him to the highest standards and is content with nothing less than his best.\\"<br />~ Hamilton Wright Mabie 1846-1916<br /><br />I found this book to be bracing, funny, touching and yes, ultimately heartwarming.  The demands Amy Chua made on her children, the way she dealt with uncomprehending friends, and her final, humbling comeuppance at the hands of her youngest daughter all make captivating reading.  One need not quite buy into the idea of \\"Chinese parenting\\"--many Chinese reviewers have disavowed it, and Chua even reports her own parents to be appalled at her strictness--in order to marvel at her brinksmanship--and her results.<br /><br />But is this approach appropriate?  America is a big, rich, free country, unlike most Asian countries. There are plenty of opportunities for the outstanding, and lots of cushion for the mediocre. So ramrodding children like Amy Chua reports herself as doing is probably not necessary for them to have an adequate life here. But, few parents I know wish mere adequacy for their children, out loud at least.<br /><br />Oh, and is she right? Well, it's hard to argue with the academic success that the statistics point to. And the much-noted suicide rates among these ramrodded young people might usefully be placed against suicides of aimless, undirected Western youth, drowning their ennui in drink and drugs. But the Western heart revulses at the notion of children being engineered rather than raised. John Stuart Mill was consciously raised to be a prodigy, and he was. But there was only one of him, and anyway he had a mental breakdown at age 20, and later wrote about how stunted and deformed his childhood was. And early 19th Century Britain was no touchy feely encounter group, certainly.<br /><br />Would she do it the same way again?  I expect so, to hear her tell it.  I know I wouldn't have the stomach for it, any more than so many other reviewers would.  But there is certainly something to be said for a parent who views herself primarily as a parent and not a big friend, like so many others do.  This gets my vote as the most intriguing nonfiction title of the year.eviewers would.

1439153663|4.0|I really liked this book's storyline and the historical accuracy within the pages, but dang it- couldn't someone have found true happiness? While I wasn't expecting a bodice ripper romance, a happier ending would have been good with me.  That aside it was very much worth reading and hummed right along.
0439023521|5.0|It took me a while to finally read this book, after hearing such good things. I read it in one day. I could not put it down!! It is constant action and suspense! I went out and bought the following two books the next day and had finished all three in a week. You can't go wrong with this book!
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This is a truly neat app.  Very easy to use. Has good directions, but it's also almost intuitive to use.  Easy to capture image and email or save.  Mates with dropbox to transfer images.  Plus, you can't beat the price.  Thanks guys.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Gives me chills. ... Hyperbole? No. Listen to this album loud in the dark. You'll see.<br /><br />Great song writing. Virtuoso guest musicians that left their egos at the door and played to the songs. Has a depth that even Insurgentes didn't quite reach.<br /><br />Look to the other reviews for a track by track critique. This review is about the feel. Get the album and you'll feel it too. There are a few notes of interest about the album though. There aren't any of SW's fellow Porcupine Tree members on this album, but some of the guests include Steve Hackett, Jordan Rudess, Nick Beggs, Tony Levin, Pat Mastelotto, Trey Gunn. The drummer on many of the tracks is named Nic France, whom I've never heard of before now, but I want to hear more!<br /><br />For you fans of Kevin Gilbert (and you really should be a fan) there is a connection! Dave Kerzner, who played \\"the mighty Wurlitzer\\" on KG's Thud is credited on this album for sound designs. Dave Kerzner is the founder of Sonic Reality, which is one of the premier sampled sound library producers. It seems his nickname is also \\"Squids\\", so he must be cool ... right?<br /><br />A final note about the album. The dedication reads:<br />\\"Dedicated to my father, Michael George Wilson - 1935-2011, without whom...\\"<br /><br />My condolences to Steven and his family. I have to wonder what influence the passing of Steven's father had on the feel of this album. We listeners are lucky for the music, but I wish only happier days for SW.
0316017930|1.0|Here it is in a nutshell, to save you the time and bother of even thinking of picking up this useless (or potentially even harmful) book:  its thesis is that outstanding successes like Bill Gates et. al. are a combination of outstanding innate ability, tremendous hard work, and-- the \\"new\\" contribution of this book-- incredible coincidences of good luck too.  Feeling motivated yet?  Well, reading all 285 pages of this book might not motivate or inform you any more than that.  In fact, reading this \\"page turner\\" is about as interesting as (and in fact, very accurately comparable to) reading 1 random page each out of 285 different, random novels.  I stuck with this book only because I kept hoping it would get better, and kept having faith that there would be a point in the end.  It didn't, and there wasn't.  Now go find something else-- preferably productive-- to read!  (It's only a click away here on Amazon.)  PS -  In various bookstores and here on Amazon, I have several times picked up, then put down, the book \\"The Tipping Point\\" by the same author. My reason: its table of contents is completely unclear (or rather, clearly light on information), and the hundreds of pages of text offer no clue as to their value: no meaningful headlines and subheadings, no meaningful graphics, etc. No sense investing several hours of my time for empty promises on the book's cover without some substantiating evidence inside that it will be a valuable investment of my time.  Now having read \\"Outliers\\" and seen how light on (or devoid of) meaningful content it is, I will not be bothering with \\"The Tipping Point\\" either. Plenty of other stuff to read instead.

0345509617|5.0|This is a wonderful read. Go through every process with George Lucas of making this Epic movie. The pictures alone are worth having this book.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This headset worked great for a while. Then almost all together the swivel part of the ear pieces break. No problem I glue them together, no more swivel. 1 month later the microphone swivel breakes, so now I can't use the mic to talk to my friend when I play black ops. This headset really is made of cheap plastic. To bad for turtle beach, they just lost a customer.
1594744769|5.0|My son is 12 going on 13 and needs to read a 1/2 hour everynight.  He likes to read in general but with this book I couldn't get him to put it down.  He said \\"this guys imagination is even crazier than Stephen Kings\\".  Which is a really big compliment.  Hopefully Ransom Riggs will write more books like this one.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|My husband and I have begun several series over the past few years several seasons late. We purchase the first seasons up to the current one on TV & have a sort of viewing orgy until we catch up to the current season. No commercials, no waiting until next week for the next episode. (This is better than watching ON Demand now that Comcast doesn't allow fast forwarding through commercials). We LOVE 'Sons of Anarchy'!!! It surprized me that in a story of this genre it has several strong female roles. I really didn't think the story of a motorcycle club would interest me but this one does.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I've loved this group since I heard them first sing together. This album doesn't let you down it is as good as the last too.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|this is a great game reminds me of when I use to play a saturn. turn based rpg great  doing other things
B0039P1O4O|3.0|A fair product, and a great price.  Very basic unit - but does all that I require - just voice.  It works well, when it works, and makes handsfree calls so much easier.  Often it will take some considerable time to recognise the phone when wihin range (ie. sitting in the drivers seat). And now occasionally, after several weeks of use, there is no volume (in either direction) when an outgoing call is initiated. Unit must be turned off/on during the call in order to re-establish volume.  Would not buy again and don't recommend to any one.  (And of course, it doesnt work with iPhone).
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This microphone is great for recording video lectures.  It is also inexpensive which is very important for most educators.  The fact that it is wired can be a bit of a hassle, but not enough to warrant spending another $100.00. The sound quality is very sufficient for the spoken word.  I would highly recommend this product for an inexpensive way to record and post lectures on the web.  Also, if you can afford it, buy a DSLR camera instead of a camcorder.  I have the Canon T3i and it is fantastic for lectures (not to mention family photos) ;-)
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This is certainly the case of Hollywood trying to cash in and try to create a cashcow franchise. But instead of being a refreshing comedy it is a disappointment of epic proportions. The first Hangover film was a brilliant comedy that was fresh, funny and creative. This sequel in comparison was a severe disappointment. The jokes were cliché and offensive in some cases (and not in a good way); the story predictable and recycled; and the writing was weak and uninteresting; and the acting was unbelievable. The only envelope that was pushed in this film was the director's ability to try to put more raunchy scenes in the film than the first film.  As such with many summer blockbusters, the limited amounts of creativity and humor were padded in the trailers, to the point when you watch the movie the jokes are no longer funny. Homophobic, racist, sterotypical/cliche jokes that made up the rest of the comedy not seen in the trailers just don't cut it.  Zach Galifianakis character, Alan, was over the top funny in the first film, in this one he just seems to be trying too hard to be awkwardly funny. Outrageous in the first movie was replaced with over acting in this sequel.  Ed Helms character, Stu, is less interesting than the first film and more whiny than ever. His character isn't enduring he's just annoying.  Justin Bartha's character, Doug, is not much more than an extended cameo in this film much like the first film. But as an audience member, you wonder why he's even in the film at all, other than continuity. It's really not enough for fans of the original.  Ken Jong plays Mr Chow, who was hilarious in the first film and managed to make even mildly racist jokes funny in The Hangover, is merely just perpetuating stereotypical Asian jokes in this film. His character, like Galifianakis's Alan, feels over acted and recycled.  Bradley Cooper's character, Phil, was about the only interesting character of this film, he's charisma was just enough to make me think that the movie was going to get better, but ultimately the film needed more than Cooper's charisma, it needed a script, a director, actors and a miracle.  Supporting cast members Jaime Chung (reality show personality turned actor) - Lauren, and Mason Lee - Teddy, are mere afterthoughts of characters when they should be interesting and part of the storyline even if they aren't in many scenes. Lauren and Stu are slated to get married, but Teddy, Lauren's brother goes missing when the guys go out on a bender for Stu's bachelor party. And other than that premise, you could really care less that Teddy is gone and that Stu is marrying Lauren. Unlike the first film where you really wanted to know what happened to Doug and how and if the guys were going to get him to his wedding on time.  I wish I could give this movie a zero stars but Amazon's lowest rating is a one. If someone were to give me this movie, I'd exchange it for something more valuable, because there's nothing this sequel had to offer other than stealing 102mins of my life away (plus the 15mins it took me to write this reveiw).
0439023513|5.0|Disctrict 12 is a big pile of ash and District 13 is real. Its unknown territory and Katniss is alone.  Nothing is as its seems or seemed. Enemies are friends and friends are enemies.  Since hunger games weve all known anything can happen. Now katniss is having to make alot of decisions. Does she become the mockingjay that the rebels have been needing to tear capitol down? does she follow coin? has haymitch known all along? and johanna mason, lets face facts, she cut up her arm.  things are never what they seem in panem. the rules change everytime snow doesnt see things going his way and everyone is free game, nobody is safe. Katniss has to find out where her loyalties lay.  dont be mislead by the organized life in early chapters. the death count is high with this one.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|MP3 download is lacking the hidden track.  Everybody always will compare a release to a previous one, or group (VH in this case). This release has got a little different vibe than the first. The players here are all heavy hitters. Everyone is doing their job, very well. While I like the more kick you in the face party anthems, which their first release contained quite a few, this one not so much. Thats ok though. There are 3 slower #'s on here that are great.  The other tracks are good, but not over the top. Joe's playing is stellar and his solo's are just awsome. He is not overplaying, which is good. Sammy's voice sounds strong. Michael's bass and backing vocals are all where they should be. Will Ferrell is a geat drummer as well. I mean Chad Smith.  Their songs have alot more hooks in them, than lets say Black Country Communion. Which by the way is a group that I think should just be blazing some trails, but seem to fall short. All in all it is some good listening, just slightly different from the first.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said already? This set contains the first full season of The Walking Dead on 2 discs. It's excellent High Def visuals and sound have been preserved on this Blu-Ray release. I recently re-watched all of these episodes in one night on these 2 Blu-Ray discs and all I can think was that buying this was well worth the price. Some extras on disc is a welcome addition too.<br /><br />Visual quality is superb.<br /><br />Audio quality is superb. Note: This is in 5.1 channel audio. This is likely due to the fact the show was recorded for HD Cable Television, which as far as I know is as high as broadcast HD television has as of yet.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and can't wait till season 2.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very well written book with a lot of cited sources to back up his words. I encourage everyone to read this book. I have given up grains for 6 months now and I have never felt better in my life and I never in my life suspected that I had even a sensitivity to gluten.
0439023491|5.0|these books are all amazing.  in this one after the fiasco that *spoiler if you never read hunger games, hey if you never read hunger games you dont need to be reading reviews on the other books! lol* katniss and peeta have put capitol in the position where to have a victor there had to be two and snow is well... mad. super mad. more than mad enough to kill. the districts and the capitol are in uproar. there are uprisings starting (thats what it means when the people stand up against capitol and we all know president snow doesnt like it when anyone goes up against him and hed kill ya for trying) and this becomes more and more aparent when peeta and katniss have to go on tour so to speak.  Snows gonna make and impression and the rules have changed. Its time to go back to the arena.  welcome to hunger games!may the odds be in your favor!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I just started this game, but it's showing a lot of promise. It seems like it's going to be very similar to battleheart, which is a favorite rpg of mine on android.<br />And the best thing about this game? It's the FAOTD and so it's free!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I have seen lots of character films and not all are fun. This is so well done that most of the others pale in comparison. A marvelous fairy tale told with expression and gusto. Paul is irreverent but full of fun and knowledge. The character is lovable and i don't want to spoil the viewing for anyone but this should be on a must see list.
B000002U82|5.0|I normally listen to classical music. But this music bridges all musical forms. It's themes and sequences fit together  as a whole into one enormous and memorable work of enduring value. Comparable to the Beatles Sergeant Pepper's or some  of Bach or Beethoven's greatest works.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am going to start this off by saying I was not going to buy this item at 1st due to its price. However one of my friends had pre-ordered it and I was able to watch the 1st of the 6 films and told myself 15 minutes in. Ok. I need to pause the movie so i can place my order NOW. I have had this item for nearly 2 weeks now and I have merely scratched the surface of the rediculously large amount of special features. The films look BEAUTIFUL and sound better than ever! I highly recommend that anyone who has even thought of watching Star Wars pick up this set. It is worth the money.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Google market just got the update please update this one as well!! other than that it is great to see it offered for free here!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is just like a good old fashioned RPG of the 8 bit style. If you enjoy those types of games than this is for you. The control needs a little getting used to but you'll get the hang of it in short order.  Highly recommended for all RPG players.  Ph: Optimus V
0811876373|5.0|I bought this at my local retailer after reading several reviews first. It was sold out of my local store so I went to another and found one. I brought it home all excited and whipped up store bought cake mix. The little cuppy things that you are supposed to put the mix in are small so I suggest using a ziplock bag and cutting the corner to put the mix into the cups because there is no way you can use a spoon without it getting everywhere. Once the thing told me it was ready I filled the cuppies with mix and closed the lid. I set my timer for 3 minutes and they came out perfect!! Now I am no Martha Stewart and Betty Crocker scoffs at my cooking attempts, but this little gadget is really great, it was so easy!! Make sure you use common sense and follow the directions and you too will have little round cakes in a Ziplock baggie waiting to be decorated!! Oh yeah, the little cups are about 1 TBS so if you fill it just to the top your pops will be nice and big..try not to over fill and have fun with it!!
1400063515|1.0|What was said in the book could be summed up in a few sentences, 2 pages max. The author went on and on with name dropping and obscure quotes, adding neither weight nor evidence to what he wanted to say, which was that many events do not fit a normal distribution (a bell curve). We all know that. Where do we go from there? No answer was given, and even with the very useful hint from one reviewer to read only Chapters 15 & 17, one could not get any answer and was bored stiff reading a drab and poorly written thesis.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I didn't hear of this album when it first came out but heard it when it was loaned to me by a high school friend back in 73. It was unlike anything out at that time. Coincidentally, they were playing in Boston promoting their new album A Passion Play. We decided after listening to the album to go to the concert. That was one of the best shows I've ever seen, what I did get to see of it. I was on the floor in the very back of the old Boston Garden and Ian looked about an inch tall but the sound was wonderful and has turned me into a lifelong Tull fan.
B000005HLV|1.0|The defenders of this album will say they like it for the atmosphere. Apparently, bad guitar work and terrible production equals \\"evil\\" and \\"atmospheric\\" to these people. Euronymous is a joke of a guitarist who thought he was creating atmosphere in the music by playing all six strings with power chords. A child can do this, and it sounds terrible. If you suck at guitar, you can always just start a band like Mayhem. The vocals sound like someone imitating and making fun of what good black metal vocals sound like. The drums are the only part of the album that required any form of talent, but its too bad that they are just annoying background noise. This is not music, not by a long shot. There is nothing evil or scary about this album, if anything it is funny. My friends and I frequently make jokes about the song Funeral Fog because of the terrible vocals. I really wanted to like this album, its too bad theres nothing here thats enjoyable. Just annoying, droning instruments that sounds like someone farted into a microphone and put it on repeat.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|I've received my package at this incredible special price. Here are few comments:  A- All 32 discs came stacked as follow: 2 stack of 16 discs each side with 4 openings around the discs that allow you to handle them easily.  B- The discs won't show the episodes printed on them. However, it comes with 1 separated \\"SHEET\\" listing all 231 episodes, season by season, disc by disc and episode by episode.( Don't lose it).  C- For some reason the Season \\"2\\" doesn't show \\"SEASON TWO\\" printed on the discs(3 discs). But, since all the remaining seasons are printed correctly, you'll figure out that the discs that don't show the season number printed on them are actually, SEASON TWO.  D- In conclusion: You can't beat this deal at all. So, as Al Bundy says: \\"Let's Rock!\\".   Highly Recommend!
1451629184|4.0|Beautifully written. Such a sad story and sad that she lost her youth  at the hands of this wild man. God bless her and her daughters
B0058VW36U|1.0|That's what I get when I open it, Nothing. GalaxyS Vibrant. Starts to load and then just hangs on the screen with the green bottle and eventually the screen times out and goes black.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|This album manages to be very heavy without the guitars actually using a lot of distortion or down tuning. It has a very retro and classic sound, with a lot of catchy hooks, and several grooving guitar riffs, especially on the song Elizabeth. Best tracks are probably Elizabeth and Ritual, but every track is good, no filler. This band sounds very unique, but most of the people that I've showed them to have enjoyed them. You can tell that the guys who wrote this were having a blast.
B005PUF0O6|5.0|Castle is one of those TV rarities that appeals equally to both genders because of the mystery, the witty scripting, the action and acting, ALL of which are superbly satisfying.  And this episode is just another gem in a continuous string of outstanding television for the entire production team at \\"Castle\\".  GOOD SHOW!
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This Is a good game. It's a must have if you like to play games like final fantasy. The Only downside it has that it is small on my screen. I use a LG Optimus V. I have small screen.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These two remastered games are the epitome of art in video games. From stunning visuals to epic storytelling to magical soundtracks, these games cover all aspects of what makes a masterpiece. I think it's great for Ueda to decide to re-release these games in HD because it helps remind the gaming community how great video games can be and how they're not just about shooting enemy soldiers, aliens, or zombies with a shotgun.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|WOW, just brilliant. Heavy as a sequoia. Raw like blue steak. What's not to love here: The unbridled drum work is spectacular, the guitars are crunchy, chunky, even emotional at times. The productions is immaculate, it captures both clarity and rawness. Nice to see they were able to change direction and NOT lose any momentum, while Crack the Skye had tinges of King Crimson this one leans towards a more Pink Floyd feel in parts. Definitely one of the better releases I've heard in a while. Buy it. Download it. Whatever. Get it. METAL.
B005O7PSRO|5.0|This episode just flat-out left my husband and I speechless.  The emotional depths of the characters exposed in this normally lighthearted series was an endearing revelation. We were devoted fans before this long-awaited episode aired, now we're more than fans.  We feel like we're part of Castle's family.  HIGHLY recommended!  Would that I could give it more than a puny 5 stars...
1905113153|5.0|a true decorators delight. wonderful detailed instructions, pictures and diagrams. this book teaches you how to make masterpieces not the run of the mill cookie cutter cakes.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Great production compared to the first record.Songwriting is much better...Very good rock album!!Listened to this 5 times all the way through.Sammy rocks!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie this DVD is for you.  The extended scenes and the deleted stuff should have made it into the movie.  It gives you a much better understanding of the character dynamics then the original movie.  Good stuff.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|The first time I went through this album - I liked one or two songs.  I tried it again the next week - liked the whole second half.  Listened to it again the same day - realized the whole album was great.  Literally was the only thing I listened to on my iPod for 2.5 weeks.  I'm still going.  I genuinely love this album. It's probably one of the best all-around albums I've heard in a long time.  AWOLNATION doesn't constrain himself to just one style of music - he's dedicated to making each song great. And that's what make this album so good. He didn't say \\"let's make a rock album\\" - he said \\"let's make a great one\\".
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I bought this a few weeks back and played for a good hour or so until I got to the first major boss. I died. I then realized that there is no auto save. For a few minutes I was quite irritated (remembering my time with Demon Souls on PS3) and then I started over.<br />Cheesy dialog, great presentation, awesome character customization... And today, it's free! You can't go wrong.
1594744769|5.0|Alright, so since I finally read harry potter and the deathly hallows a couple months ago I have been looking for something to fill the void. I absolutely loved deathly hallows and it instantly became my all time favorite book. So in my journey to find a replacement I read quite a few series such as Twilight(hated it),LOTR, Hunger games(loved it), millenium series (not bad)and even ventured into the kids books, A series of unfortunate events, which for a 25 year old man I probably enjoyed it more than I should.  It was becoming apparent that their wasn't any book out there to match the masterpiece I consider the Deathly hallows to be. Then one day walking down Walmart I saw this book. It was so \\"peculiar\\" I had to pick it up and study it. I quickly decided to write the title down and ran home to order it on amazon. When I received it I was more excited than usual about a book, it is a beautiful book,it just draws people in (which you will notice if you read on the train)  Alright so I read it,I wont go into the story cause everyone else does. When I was done I immediately wanted more. I for the first time felt that special something I felt a decade ago when I read the sorcerer's stone. I strongly believe this will be my new favorite series even though next book isn't coming until spring 2013.  Trust me Buy it, but be prepared for an magical romantic sci-fi adventure book and not a thriller. Also expect movies, the movie rights were won even before it was published.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm really into dystopian novels like 1984, brave new world, the road, etc. Although this is geared toward a younger audience, I found it was a lot more grown up than i expected. I was worried I wouldn't get into it after the first chapter, but after that I couldn't put it down. The story surges ahead with nail biting action.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|It is a very fun toy for my son, he is 11 years old and he likes to play with his friends with this guns.
1466208686|5.0|I thought \\"Programming Interviews Exposed\\" was a very good book, but this one is even better!  A lot more actual question, some obvious, some much harder. Really good as a brain teaser too. If you like challenging problems regardless if you are preping for interview or just professional who likes flexing the Dev-muscle, this one is a very good read! It's not a \\"data-structures and algorithms\\" book, its how to apply them and pick right solution, each problem has in depth analyses of options as well.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|Josh Groban has done it again. This new CD is full of beautiful music, much of which Josh Groban wrote himself. His voice is still able to move and inspire.
B005COO1X6|3.0|all in one.  Typical King. He's done it all, I think. And redone, and redone it. It was readable and not a waste of money but it wasn't a five star either. I loved all of Kings books right up till the time he was hit by the car and that's when he went over the edge in my opinion. Anyway, this one was a good story and worth the 3.00 I paid for it.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I purchased this game a while back and I still consider this one of the best games I've ever played on a mobile platform. In fact, it is one of a handful of games that I actually finished. This game is that good!
B005CW5E3E|5.0|When Johnny Winter released \\"I'm A Bluesman\\" in 2004, critics were brutal-\\"lost his feral growl, no longer plays speedy solos\\", etc. The good news is that Johnny's health has improved greatly since that time, and his renewed vigor is apparent in \\"Roots\\". Add the production talents of guitarist Paul Nelson, and Winter has given us a winner.  Personally, I love the recent trend of Blues and R&B artists in all star collaborations. The opening track.\\"T-Bone Shuffle\\" features the incredible talents of slide master Sonny Landreth. \\"Farther On Up the Road\\" shows what a fine guitarist Jimmy Vivino is. He has a talent for making good material great, and his ability to elevate the star of the show is second to none (check out his contributions to Shemekia Copeland's first recording, \\"Turn the Heat Up\\"). On the Elmore James chestnut \\"Done Somebody Wrong\\", Warren Haynes invokes the great Duane Allman in the intro, then steps back while Johnny takes the first solo. The respect these two have for each other is apparent; neither one getting in the others way.  For the harmonica freaks, back to back tracks feature two very accomplished-and very different players. \\"Got My Mojo Workin'\\" has been done to death, but Frank Torre of the King Bees blows new life into the well worn standard. John Popper plays what may be his finest recorded solo on \\"Last Night\\". Johnny's solo on this cut is sublime.  The album's lone instrumental is Bill Dogett's \\"Honky Tonk\\", featuring brother Edgar on sax. They play the melody together and swap solos-nice to hear them work together again. Mike DiMeo adds classic R&B organ while Nelson supports the band with a strong, loping rhythm.  It's hard to pick a favorite track on this CD, but I have to lean toward \\"Come Back Baby\\". John Medeski plays a jazzy organ solo in the style of Jimmy Smith, and DiMeo adds an after hours style of Blues piano (think Ray Charles' \\"A Fool For You\\"). Johnny is supported here by a full horn section- something atypical for him. His solo alone will make you want to repeat the track many times. For those worried about his voice, he has never sounded better than he does here.  Hopefully, Johnny's older fans will appreciate this most recent effort. As for new fans, there isn't any reason you can't start right here.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I received the order within a few days of placing my order. Thank you for such great service. I will order from you again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game. Fun and entertaining with just the right amount of challenge! Highly recommended... The little critter is adorable too
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|The game itself is great. It really gets the nostalgia juices flowing with its classic, almost 8-bit art, and turned based combat in a traditional high fantasy setting. It does what it aims to do stylistically well so you really can't take points off the concept.<br /><br />That being said the execution could use some work. The sprites occasionally glitch and the keyboard controls range from lacking to almost non-existant when it comes to the combat screens. Its a bit disappointing it doesn't have keyboard/controller input support as I could easily see them working well in a game like this.<br /><br />4 Star Game - 1 Star for Lack of Keyboard Support.<br />Hardware: Droid 2
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I purchased the Blueray version of this movie and the video was excellent, sound OK.  The storyline is just so predictable, with some really second-rate acting from the 'hero'.  Continuity was questionable in a couple of scene changes.  I love scifi and epic type movies, but this one was really boring and I would not recommend it, unless you are a huge fan and need it for your collection.  It really deserves only one star but at least I did not fall asleep before the end, so it was borderline interesting enough for 2.
0345529057|5.0|I am an avid reader.  My favorite books of late have been Ken Follett (15 + in a row.  This series is magical and enthralling.  Any reader who loves the old times of kings and queens, plot, character development, and bravery will really LOVE this.

I have been on a quest to find a decent garlic press after watching a season of Jamie Oliver's thirty minute meals. I realised that I could save a lot of time by using a press, but of course I was searching for one that would crush without the need for massive strength and crush the garlic clove without leaving half of it behind. This press has fulfilled my expectations, even though I bought 2 other garlic presses which cost half the price. How's that for false economy? I just love the way the Rosle functions as well as the nifty sieve which makes it super easy to clean.
B004LROMSO|3.0|While Camelot has a large following and has had some very good reviews, I was disappointed with the Season One series.  Politically correct to the extreme, Camelot does not fit the true time frame of other versions.  A brilliant cast, led by Joseph Fiennes does not make up for the so-so writing and the yawn-worthy episodes. I would not recommend this version for those who like historical accuracy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|A perfect little game well executed. The art is clever. The gameplay is simple yet still full of nuance and there is some mental agility required to play. Overall, great combination. This is the type of game I WANT my kids to play . . . but they'll have to wait their turn.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|I can't imagine how polarizing this album must have been upon it's release back in 1969. Even though he had tinkered with electric instrumentation on his previous two LPs, In A Silent Way is in essence Miles throwing down the gauntlet and making the transition into his controversial fusion period...full speed ahead, never turning back. That being said, this record is strikingly different from Miles's other fusion classics. In fact, it feels a bit silly for me to label this as \\"fusion\\" at all. It has very little in common with traditional jazz other than some of the instruments used, and it is most certainly not rock . However you want to pigeonhole In A Silent Way is up to you. But for me, this recording is a genre all it's own, nocturnal, hypnotic, enigmatic and  achingly gorgeous. There are only two tracks, both around 20 minutes in length, both haunting, warm and densely textured--not to mention high on replay value--with one of the most potent lineups in history including John McLaughlin. Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea and Tony Williams. If you have even a passing interest in Miles Davis, snatch this one up immediately and hear what you've been missing out on. If jazz/fusion/whateveryouwannacallit isn't your thing, try it out anyway. You may come away a believer.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key is a compelling story that draws you in. From the beginning, you are vested. You know you will read this book through to the end. The story line is seamless and heart-wrenching...until you get about two-thirds through the book and then something is lost in the story. In the end, I think the author pandered to her demographic instead of being true to the story. Don't get me wrong, the book is great. It's just that the first two-thirds is better than the end.  Still, an awesome read. Enjoy!

B003L77G2Y|3.0|For the most part, the series returns to its broad story arc of two parallel universes, one of which is our own, racing to destroy the other before being destroyed by the other. And for the most part, it's fast-paced and action-packed. There is also some incredible acting from Anna Torv and John Noble, two actors I'd never heard of before. Each becomes such a different person in the alternate universe. John Noble, especially, tugs at your heart in one universe. He makes you just want to hug his Walter character, pat him on the back and say, \\"That's OK. You didn't mean to pull two universes apart.\\" His quest for scientific knowledge decades ago did just that. And his portrayal of Walternate (get it? Walter + alternate?) makes you wonder how you could ever have any sympathy for such a cold-hearted bastard.  But there are still some major flaws in the story-telling that all but ruin the series. There are a lot of bad guys that our heroes, the Fringe unit, have to stop. But all too often they figure out who the bad guy is -- or where he will commit his next act of terrorism -- by going to one brainiac or another and asking him/her to solve the puzzle. Which, of course, the brainiac instantly does by telling her questioners to go on the Internet and cross-reference these two or three databases.  Life is really that easy. You can solve all your problems if only you know the two databases you need to call up on the Internet and cross-reference.  The other big problem is all the one-episode plots that have absolutely nothing to do with the story arc. The Fringe division is constantly being called away from saving the world to work on strange mysteries that really have no consequence on anything. There is so much time-wasting in this series, I almost wish the show were on a premium cable channel that only required it to put out 12 episodes a year. Clearly the writers are scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to fill 22 episodes.
B000ION79Y|2.0|With a plot that is often difficult to make heads or tails of, Attack Force (2006) is one wacky and confusing adventure flick.  At times what happens is so ridiculously obtuse, that it is unintentionally humorous.  Action star Steven Seagal, does very little fighting until the very end.  Throughout the film, Seagal's voice annoyingly alternates between his own, and being dubbed by someone who sounds much older (reportedly Martin Sheen) and lacks Seagal's trademark drawl.<br /><br />Marshall Lawson (Seagal), some kind of operative for the US government, is in Paris with his associate Dwayne (Davis Kennedy), preparing for some kind of mission.  Three new members of Lawson's unit visit a bar, and bring back a girl named Reina (Evelyne Armela O'Bami) to their hotel room.  Unfortunately instead of a night of fun, the men are murdered, and are apparently injected with CTX, an experimental drug that can make people hyper-violent.<br /><br />Lawson's close friend Tia (Lisa Lovbrand) is a biochemist who happens to have worked on the development of CTX, together with a man named Aroon (Adam Croasdell), who has since \\"defected\\".  Aroon is the owner of the bar the soldiers visited, and has been testing CTX on his customers and employees, including Reina.<br /><br />Aroon is working with a woman (credited as \\"the Queen\\" and played by Ileana Lazariuc) and has plans to release CTX into the city's water supply.  Lawson is working to prevent this, as well as track down the killer of his men.  Also in the picture are American naval intelligence, and the French police.<br /><br />The pieces don't fit together very well, but it all builds up to a massive assault led by Lawson, who leads a convoy of military vehicles to a small village where Aroon is headquartered.  The action sequences, involving soldiers gunning down CTX infected civilians, are pretty appalling.  Lawson himself kills a couple who are dining, with rapid fire shots to the head.<br /><br />The team proceeds to a church, where Aroon is processing the CTX.  One of the gimmicks featured in the film are blades attached to the wrists.  Using these weapons, Lawson battles Aroon and the Queen, who are both amped up on CTX.  Most of his fight with the Queen is shown in slow motion, with Seagal often waving his hands around ridiculously.  Lawson wounds the Queen in the chest, slashing her bra in half, but she manages to continue fighting without exposing her ample bloodstained breasts.  Seagal's fighting scenes come mostly at the very end, and are certainly far from his best work, although the nanographite wrist blades do deliver some nasty wounds.  Building quality in France must not be very good, as people keep crashing through walls.<br /><br />A very ragged affair that fragments apart at the end, Attack Force is a blend of short action sequences, and a series of obscure meetings with pretentious dialog, that culminates with an insane military operation.  As the film concludes, Aroon has succeeded in contaminating the water supply with CTX, and Lawson's attack force is sadly reduced to just two men.  Sony Pictures apparently was unsure about the direction that Attack Force would ultimately take, and their decision is quite bad, as dozens of US troops lie dead on foreign soil, and some French citizens will soon be experiencing the wonders of CTX.  Though this disaster rates only 1.5 stars, and Seagal's performance is far from stellar, it may not be fair to blame him for matters that were out of his control.f the gimmicks featured in the film are blades attached to the wrists.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|I am a huge Opeth fan but this album is so slow and sludgy that it never gets traction. I have tried listening to it a number of times and it just doesn't have anything to keep me interested. From Blackwater Park to this? Dissapointed.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|The CGI is great. There's the mansion and gladiator quarters built right on the edge of a high cliff, the walls melting into the cliff's walls. Just awesome. And there's all that skin. The gladiators are also called upon to sexually service their masters. And there's all the detail from Roman times that catches you by surprise.  During one discussion, two characters are walking through a narrow alley when they suddenly pull up and decide to sit down on what appears to be a bench on one side of the alley. They continue their discussion. One of them is eventually handed an oblong rod of some sort that he inserts between his legs and kind of wipes upward before returning the rod to the slave that handed it to him. The rod is then dipped into a tank of water and handed to the other character. He also uses it to do something between his legs before handing it back. The two characters get up and continue their stroll and conversation.  Wait a minute? What just happened? Oh, now I get it. Yuck.  There are a lot of yuck moments in Spartacus. Guys get heads sliced off. Hearts torn out. Eyes gouged. But it's all done in an exaggerated CGI style that makes it more riveting than gross or even violent.  In one gladiator match, a contestant gets his chest sliced, blood sprays out, then, NFL Films style, the camera zooms in on the spray of blood as it flies through the air. The crowd noise goes silent. The picture shifts into slow-motion. And the instant your eyes are captured by this splatter of blood, the crowd noise roars back, the image begins moving in real time and the blood splashes all over people in the front row of the stands.  Ohhhhh!  I actually had an involuntary physical response -- a jolt -- to that sequence.  But the CGI and action scenes are all fluff. This is a show about politicking. About power. About attaining power and the consequences of reaching for it. The characters, plot and acting are good enough that you will get lost in the story.  But you'll also bewishing for more of that CGI gore.  Yuck.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Even though this is a remastering, I do want to talk about the actual games for a moment as many people who are interested may not have played them.  ------------------  ICO  ------------------  Ico is one of my favorite games of all time. It was a game I knew I would love when I played the first demo but it still caught me by surprise when I got my hands on it. It is atmospheric, emotional, and absolutely mesmerizing.   It hit me at a perfect time in my life as well. I was 16 and to be honest, I had no problem with most stories in video games even though looking back, a lot of my favorite games have offensively bad stories. Ico barely has a story, and is so much better for it.   When I put this collection on last night, a friend was asking me about what was happening in the beginning, and I explained the whole story in a very matter of fact manner. After playing through a few scenes I realized that a lot of my story was made up, because thats what it was: MY story. I had made it up as I adventured with Yorda to explain what we were doing and who the Queen was.  You can now learn a bit more of the story since this is based on the European version, Yorda's words will be translated the 2nd time through. It is still as minimalist as the rest of the game, and I was happy to finally see what she was saying while playing instead of on a Youtube video.  The gameplay is essentially a huge environmental puzzle to escape the castle safely with Yorda. The castle is absolutely stunning in the way its pathways unfold. Occasionally you will open a door and be completely floored by what its connected to. The castle is entirely traversable and slowly unlocks similar to some survival horror games(RE1 mostly), but with really good puzzles.  The combat is simplistic and attempts to invoke fear as you feel nearly helpless before getting the sword or one of the secret weapons. Its not great combat, but it really isn't a focus either and you can skip all but 5 or 6 battles. It is sure tobe the reason some dislike the game(as it was at release), but they are very much missing the point in my opinion. It is not a combat heavy game by any means.  If you like Mayazaki's films, particularly Princess Mononoke, you really have to give this game a shot. It may be due to my age when they were released, but these two stories are very dear to me and feel like they could almost be in the same world. It also laid a lot of groundwork for POP:The Sands of Time, and Jordan Mechner has said as much.  -----------------------------  Shadow of the Colossus  -----------------------------  This is a much more well known game so I will keep this brief.  Shadow of the Colossus is a massive adventure game that was really ahead of its time. The titular colossi basically serve as both the levels and bosses. They are brief when done correctly, but its all about the journey, not the destination. You will spend a lot of time figuring out how to climb up and maneuver them.  It pins the combat directly to the platforming, and it feels amazing to topple these creatures. There really is nothing like it aside from the occasional copycat boss fight we've seen this gen(Castlevania: Lords of Shadow had 2 shameless ripoffs from colossi battles, all the way down to where you stabbed them).  The rest of the world is a bit barren, but its definitely a design choice, and really sticks out to those who enjoy it. When you actually do find something noteworthy, it just feels that much better. You will feel like a true explorer, and no matter how exciting it is, you will feel a slight tinge of fear every time you venture a little further than you've been(I'm really scared of heights also, and this game conveys the feeling almost too well at times). There are a few items you can hunt for, which makes exploring more interesting and productive.  The atmosphere is even more pronounced than in Ico, and the story is similarly emotional with a theme of selflessness and consequences for your every action. I do personally prefer Ico, but even I can admit Shadow is the better game. It definitely holds up better for newcomers as well, but you should play Ico first so you don't miss any connections.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So what is in this new release to make them worth repurchasing? I don't even know where to start!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ico is full 1080p and 60 frames per second. The framerate was never really an issue but it is definitely welcome, and this game looks unbelievable. I really can't overstate this, for a near launch PS2 game it holds up very well. The animations  are amazing, even most of the textures hold up well. It doesn't look like a PS3 game exactly, but these are definitely the best looking and most improved HD remasters we have gotten yet. I hope SH and MGS collections have this much work put into them. It is also based on the Euro version so you have New Game+,Yorda's speech is translated, a new secret weapon, a new post ending scene(short but sweet), and a 2nd player can control Yorda after the first playthrough.  Shadow gets an even bigger upgrade, as framerate was a huge problem in the original. It is now \\"locked 30\\" though it does dip to 26ish at times on a colossi. It also includes the small changes to the Euro version, such as a small slowmo scene on your killing blow to a colossus. Its resolution is not full 1080p, and upscaled it does lose some fidelity and has minor framerate issues, so it is recommended that you set your PS3 to 720p while playing this one. If you don't manually change it it will automatically go to upscaled 1080, changing the shape of the pixels making up the image. Not a huge issue by any means, but i like my games looking their best.  Shadows graphics look amazing. The only things that really stand out as dated are hair and cloth, and that is to be expected, as most hair and cloth still look really bad in games. The valleys and vistas are expansive, and always visible although there are several models with varying detail depending on how far you are from an object. Its definitely more noticeable than on PS2 but its a small price to pay for the insane level of draw distance. The only noticeable pop in i've seen is in the temple after downing a colossus. After the cutscene when you get control again, you can sometimes see assets popping in off in the distance beyond the girls resting place.  The Colossi in particular are breathtaking, and more detailed than anything else in the game by far. The slight motion blur while riding Agro is also a very nice touch and makes the visuals really pop.  The extras include developer interviews, concept and prototype videos for the original Ico on PS1 and the version we eventually got, and Nico(essentially a multiplayer version of SOTC that was more directly tied to Ico)/SOTC. There is also a dynamic theme for each game but they are cheap and terrible, and flicker constantly. They also both play in 3D but sadly i don't have a 3DTV to experience this, though I have heard they look great, one person going so far as saying Ico was his favorite game so far to play in 3D.  So there you have it, a longwinded and schizophrenic review of some of my favorite games. Just buy them and i'll stop talking, k?
B0055B0MIO|4.0|There are no surprises in to this album, which is a good thing. If you like Trivium then you won't be dissapointed. I find towards the end it gets a bit much but a really great effort. As good as Shogun - oh and one of the best album covers for 2011.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|How many rock bands make music this good and viable in their 40s?<br />If you don't get Wilco on first listen, play it again until the depth sinks in. Support guys who represent musical integrity and buy their work. These guys make great music and are an American institution.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Over the past 10 years or so I've become addicted to war movies. I've seen as many as I could. While there are a few very good ones, this is the only one that feels real. There are intense battle scenes. There are plenty of explosions. Plenty of suspenseful standoffs at gunpoint. But what makes it real is that the soldiers are not portrayed as heroes. They are portrayed as human beings, many of whom become conflicted by what they witness and by their own actions. They actually grow as their war continues, and some of them begin questioning their purpose in Iraq.  What this particular unit went through and how they reacted to it in the opening days of the Iraq war was just amazing. How their actions, decision-making, clownig around and their deepest thoughts -- how their compassion -- was captured by a single print journalist was amazing. How their story was retold years later by filmmakers who weren't even there was once again amazing. You won't be able to stop talking about this DVD. And you won't be able to get it out of your head, either.

B005DZMP00|5.0|It is so great to hear the 1st 3 tracks of disc 2, from the Bickershaw Festival, England, without the hiss of my 25 yr. old tape! If you are a fan of the experimental, abstract jamming that the Dead featured prominently in their '72 - '74 shows, then this inclusion in this set alone makes this one worth the price of admission.  The rest of disc 2 is solid also.  The 1st disc, although from different sources, plays like a typical 1st set of the era.  Great sound, they sure preserved those tapes well!  An all around worthwhile purchase for fans of this era GD music.
0060755598|5.0|Not earth shattering but good and usefull info.  The narator sounds like he is talking down to people...but in a way he probably is talking down to many of his readers. Still, good book.
0385344325|3.0|For Reacher fans, this flashback novel on Reacher's last days in the Army is historically interesting because it fills gaps in his resume. It provides a different reason for why he left the Army than given in earlier novels. It also shows how Reacher's \\"no suitcase, will travel\\" ethos got started. Unfortunately, the novel is marred by excessive violence than exceeds the violence of any previous Reacher book and the aftermath is simply not credible. It's been a long series and Childs has done a good job in keeping the quality level up, but we may look at this novel as the beginning of a marked decline in the series. However, having said that, even a mediocre Reacher is still a good read. But you would not want to recommend this book to your friends for their first Reacher novel.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Tackling the issues of the day with honesty and humor, this series is the pinnacle of TV drama. The quality gets better as cast and writers become grow in their roles. The final season easily is the most memorable and emotional with the Jimmy Smits campaign storyline and the tragic loss of John Spencer. You can play the cynic and argue that Hollywood was pushing a left-ist agenda, but that's a lazy excuse for not coming up with actual rebuttals of the show's dialogue that treated both sides of the aisle with respect (something missing from real-life political quips).

Suggestions are, clear game cache, reboot phone, remove crappy 3rd party task managers, remove installed system utilities, reboot, back up phone and factory reset, free up space, reboot, get a better phone, reboot, reboot, uninstall 3rd party launchers, contact developer, reboot, or just a dumbphone and play snake.

0525423281|4.0|So, I know everybody and their mother that hasn't already read it is dying for the upcoming release of Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins. I was definitely no exception - I could not wait to get my hands on it after the brilliant awesomeness that is Anna and the French Kiss. However - while Lola had a lot of amazing things going for it, it didn't live up to Anna for me.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins is so flippin' fantastic at weaving tons of detail into her writing that it is unreal. Seriously, I was in awe of this in her first book and it is nothing is not stepped up even higher in Lola. The personalities of Lola and Cricket are outstanding...and all the secondary characters are richly fleshed out as well. Seriously, I bow down to the master. Everything from Cricket's crazy inventions as a kid to the kinds of candy Lola leaves lying around her room add so much depth and realism to the story. I could rave about it forever. I loved Lola's dads, their dog (with the awesome name Heavens to Betsy), and even the characters we're meant to dislike are brought to life so well that it is easy to imagine knowing them.<br /><br />Also, don't even get me started on the repeated appearances of Anna and St. Clair. Swoon. SWOON.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was the plot of the story that didn't work as well for me as Anna. Don't get me wrong - I still liked it a lot and plan on adding the book to my shelves when it is released, I just want to caution you to lower your expectations just a tiny bit so you won't feel the same twinge of disappointment I did. Lola and Cricket had a lot of things keeping them apart in this book just like Anna and St. Clair had in their story - however, in the first book I felt like there were so many circumstances in the way that they simply couldn't have come together any sooner or in a better way. In this book, I wanted to punch Lola in the face for being so immature. Seriously, Cricket was there. Waiting for her. Loving her. Being there for her. She was stubbornly dating a JERK, bound and determined to prove to everyone that she was right. Holy Toledo was it frustrating.<br /><br />Anyway, this is obviously all just my personal preference, because I know the vast majority of people who have read it really do love it more than Anna. I just wanted to add my cautionary note to those of you that might feel the same way I do - prepare to enjoy the story, just don't read it with a constant comparison in mind!ting a JERK, bound and determined to prove to everyone that she was right.

1439107955|5.0|I heard about this book from a friend who is highly discriminating in his taste for historical fiction and nonfiction. I have a fair number of friends and relatives coping with cancer in its various forms and have recommended this book to all of them. It traces the history of cancer and those who have struggled with understanding it from the time of Galen. It also includes vignettes introducing patients waiting for answers. The author describes this book as a biography of cancer, which does seem to have a life of its own. The book is very comprehensive and detailed, rich with references. I would recommend it to anyone who has cancer or loved ones coping with it. The struggle is sometimes a complicated one to follow and goes into research design as well as biochemistry and life at the cellular level. However the author is careful to explain each of these and their contribution to the understanding and treatment of cancer.

1609611543|5.0|Before I had even heard about Dr. Davis and his mind-enriching book, my personal experiences with all grains--white, whole, organic, franken-grains or otherwise--have led me to a grain-free diet. My health has been flourishing, and I will never again disrespect my body by allowing any of them to pass through my mouth where it will cause much harm. I follow a paleo diet, which I thrive on. My body is in such a cleansed state, that if I eat anything that does not agree with it, within 30-minutes to an hour I am feeling negative symptoms. Grains, especially wheat, immediately cause the following symptoms in my body:  brain fog, short-term memory loss, arthritic pain, fatigue, itchy-watery eyes, sinus congestion, breathing difficulties, hypoglycemia, and the list goes on. Personal experience gives me what my truth is about diet; each individual has that ability if they so choose. I don't need the guidance of the FDA, ADA, AMA or the government to tell me what makes me healthy. Anyone with any common sense would know where I would be if I followed any of their advice.<br />I purchased Dr. Davis' book in order to gain more knowledge about the history of wheat, and his clear, in-depth research had given me more than what I had anticipated. This is a book I have been and will continue to recommend to anyone and everyone who is wondering why their health continues to deteriorate and why they can't lose their excess baggage when they are doing everything possible to reduce their weight once and for all.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this as a solution to consolidate an existing two piece (FM modulator/MP3 player). It plugged right into my cigarette lighter port and allows you to adjust the faceplate so that it is easily viewed. Just to get started I set up a 2K SD card formatted to FAT32. I set up 4 directories and filled them with mp3 files. I popped the card in, set the frequency up to a known dead spot (88.7 mhz) and away it went. The signal strength was great and I've never had a radio station's signal supersede the player's signal. Maybe it could happen if I set it on the same frequency as one of the big Boston stations but so far no problems.  I was easily able to navigate the directories. Like any other electronic device you have to learn how it works and its hidden behaviors like it'll power itself on when you start your car. After playing all the songs in a directory it will automatically advance to the next directory. I found nothing to be problematic and I'm enjoying it. In fact I'm thinking of canceling my XM subscription.

The 80's pop-culture references is like nostalgia candy, and you will find your geeky self smiling and yelling \\"Awesome!\\" throughout the entire book.  It's very clever, and you know you want to dork out every once in a while!  It should make a fun movie for sure.

1609611543|5.0|I have systematically been subtracting and adding back in different foods from my diet for almost 2 years now, in an effort to figure out what it was that \\"gets me\\" almost every time I eat.  I thought it was grains in general, then I thought it was soy, then egg and so on.  I figured out dairy was a culprit quickly and easily, but the other dietary villain, I found, was wheat. However, I figured this out months before I read this book.  I bought the book to help me (a 40-year old, high school science teacher) understand what it was about wheat that was causing my myriad of problems (and what I feel might be the cause of my daughter's arthritis at age 16). I have more energy and sleep more soundly, I haven't been sick since removing wheat from my diet, my gall bladder problems have gone away entirely, I'm less swollen with water and gas (huge difference alone) and my neck's herniated disk that flares up periodically, has stopped bothering me altogether.  If I cheat and have wheat, I pay within hours and for the next couple of days with nondescript aches, lethargy and bloating - which is not fun when you're now used to a flat belly, something I've not had since before my 3 kids.  Pretty easy to see the correlation here.  Thanks for the confirmation, Wheat Belly!
B004LROMSO|4.0|This DVD series is based on the legends with which many are familiar.  It has the usual people and usual incidents that one would expect of the King Arthur tales, but don't expect them to follow the plots of the story you know and love.  However, the stories they did tell are an interesting twist on the old legends.<br /><br />This is not the best fantasy staging I have ever seen; there is a lack of realism.  Camelot must be small because it takes very little time to travel between farms and castles.  When the men are out hunting deer they are talking and stumbling all over the forest.  There are very few characters in any setting, castle, village, and soldiers.  Most disturbing in my opinion is the choice of actors for King Arthur, Jamie Campbell Bower.  There is some nudity and violence but it doesn't distract from the story.<br /><br />That said, I liked and would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys fantasy, King Arthur, or the Middle Ages.  It has some interesting story twists regarding the Lady in the Lake and Excalibur.  As some others, I loved Eva Green as Morgan.  I would like to see how the story continues if STARZ decides to continue the series.
0374290024|4.0|This is a very interesting book, although I don't know how good a \\"prediction\\" of the future it presents.  The most intriguing feature of it is Mr. Morris's quantification of the standard of living in different civilizations throughout history.  On the whole, his \\"mathematical\\" formula of social development over time since the last ice age probably is not too far off the mark.  Of course, since none of us today never lived through any time period more than about 100 years ago, we will never really know how accurate Mr. Morris's calculations are or were.  Whether one agrees with his analysis or not, this book is definitely interesting and worth a read.  I had trouble putting it down.  That said, I am curious about why he left out certain aspects of world civilization throughout history.  I notice that India gets very short shrift.  At certain points of time, India probably had a comparable level of social development as China or the West.  Although he mentions the social development of Japan, it also gets very little discussion about its contributions to world civilization.  I realize that Mr. Morris is discussing broad, general trends in historical development, but it seems wrong to leave out such important influences.  I also expected to see more about the social development levels of Africa, particularly in the so-called prehistoric times.  In my humble opinion, one of the biggest omissions in this book is the impact of environmentalism and ecology in modern times.  He gives this one brief paragraph, stating that while some people have tried to modify their lives by showing respect for the environment, there is little or no chance that these lifestyle changes will affect social development.  He leaves out any discussion of the attempts to find other sources of energy besides fossil fuels.  Likewise, he dismisses any efforts on the part of nations, international bodies, and individuals to curb the negative aspects of our present level of energy use and waste.  Given his discussion of the impact that environment and geography have had on the birth and growth of countries and regions, I was expecting him to discuss these extremely important issues in all of our lives.  Frankly, given the rapid deterioration of our environment, this alone is going to probably be the single largest cause of the drop in our social development.  Already, we are seeing that the US alone is more and more unable to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation (witness what happened after Hurricanes Katrina and Irene and this year's devastating wildfires and tornadoes!).  Put it all together, and we are going to see our social development take a huge nosedive, possibly in many people's present lifetimes.  You don't have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, as they say!  That is why I gave this book 4 stars instead 5.
1609611543|5.0|I have been following Dr. Davis for some time now.  He is a very educated, strong person who is willing to sacrifice a lot for all of us.  He is going to take a lot of unfair shots from those who have a lot to lose by Americans not consuming wheat.  He is doing this for all of us who can become healthier by not consuming the wheat which is vastly different from that of 100 years ago.  That cannot be refuted.    The only negative I have is that I ordered the eBook then I found out that there are recipes in the back....not in the eBook.
0061997811|5.0|It was great being able to read about each of the characters and see how they were chosen. It was also nice to know where all the scenes were filmed.  As a viewer, you never realize all the hard work that went into the making of these 8 movies.  They have given me many hours of enjoyment and I am so glad that the orginial cast was able to stay throughout (excluding Richard Harris:(). This is a beautiful book and I will treassure it.

B001NFNFIK|5.0|When reading a James Lee Burke book, I have my own picture of each Character, right down to the Bait Shop Umbrella.  So when \\"Heavens Prisoners\\" came out, I nearly doubled over with Grief in the direction that was taken.  Then along came this movie, and the cover said, \\"Give Me a Shot\\".  So I did.  My first impression, was that it did good to apologize for the travesty of the first movie, but I would have really loved to have seen Clete Purcel and New Orleans, and all the Shadiness of an earlier book come out.  Even for true fans, Like myself, this seems to be okay.  I really enjoyed TLJ's performance, and the scenery used in the movie.  If you read the book, it might resonate over to the movie, but it may take a few books to really understand what 'Streak' is really about.
1609611543|5.0|The saying \\"the proof is in the pudding\\" well as long as it is made with almond, coconut flour or arrowroot that is!!  I have been following this wheat free plan for just a week and already the ache/pain in my knees has been reduced.  I have lost 1/2 inch from my waist and am down 4 pounds in my weight.  My friend is doing this with me too, her foggy thinking has cleared.  I am just amazed and highly recommend this book to all.  It is easy to do and no deprived feelings at all.  Thank you Dr. Davis for writing such a great book, this is going to change history.  If the wheat industry would just go back to the non altered varieties maybe we could trust to enjoy it again... until this happens my puddin' and bread will be made with almond or coconut flour.  Yes!!  feeling sooooo much better already!!!  [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]
1597801585|5.0|I purchased this book a day before the flooding hit from Irene.  It arrived on-time and in relatively good condition; during the shipping the item had been crushed and now the cover wears a hefty twist/dent, but even for all of this, the item was in practically new condition, none of the damage due to the seller.  The book itself I am still working on, but it is enthralling and thought-provoking.  If you're looking for this book and want it fast and cheap, this is the seller to buy from, and if you want a book that gives you more than an every-day subject and plot with writing that is difficult enough to keep you motivated and challenged, yet still be intriguing, wild, and fast-paced, this is definitely the book to buy.  Like the cover says, it really is a modern day \\"1984.\\"  If you love science fiction, this should definitely be on your shelf.

1423389387|3.0|I picked up this audio in the middle of the series, so you can blame much of my comments on that.  The book lulled me into a meandering story about Kvothe the Bloodless who tells his story to Chronicler.  It's an interesting read, but goes through many apparently disconnected wanderings of Kvothe.  This book isn't finished by a long shot, and I felt pretty annoyed with the ending, which simply wasn't.<br /><br />About one third of the way through the book, I realized this isn't really a story with a plot.  It's a tale with no real end.  I spent a good portion listening to it because the characters did pull me in.  They were fun.  Kvothe's exploits were fun.  At the end, the story felt a waste of my time.<br /><br />That being said, Rothfuss has the ability to hold you, even with cliches and repetition that left me grinding my teeth.  The reader, Nick Podehl, is simply awesome and has a wonderful voice.  I think most of my enjoyment came from just listening to him.<br /><br />I think if you've read the first book, you may love this book.  I didn't and probably won't pick up the next book.

B001CMSTBM|4.0|This is a great debut CD from a regional Texas band.  Cast from the same mold as Cross Canadian Ragweed, Whiskey Meyers kicks up the \\"Red Dirt\\" music.  I stumbled across this CD from a friend and it became to be in the regular rotation of back porch party music.  Road Life offers a little bit to all, Rebel Country, Hippie Jamming and cool guitar work.  Grab this one, you'll like it.
B005EVVESM|4.0|I started liking Maroon 5 several years ago when Songs about Jane came out. Did not buy at time since a lot was going on, I broke down and bought this one first and liked more songs on this album than the others I have. The songs presentations remind me of the standard way rock and pop music is played and at least Adam Levine sings instead of screaming out the lyrics in several directions.
B00005JOA0|3.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this miniseries, but was surprised to discover that the DVD quality was very poor. The picture looked like a low-resolution transfer, and it's an irregular 14:9 aspect ratio, which required a zoom setting on the TV. (Further reducing picture quality.) I expected the disc to be the same quality as other BBC DVDs. It's not.<br /><br />It's still a great costume drama, though. I love that it explores marriage, not just romance. And the acting, direction and cinematography are very good.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have watched it twice already.  You get more out of it each time you watch it.  The setting, actors, everything is great about this movie.  My husband & I love this era/period in time.  BBC does great, as usual.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|Played the game for around a half-hour or so, and found it to be enjoyable. Reminds me of old school SNES RPGs. Nice graphics, good music, decent story so far, controls are better than some other games I've played in this style.   My main complaint is that the game doesn't seem to simply suspend itself if interrupted. I got a text message popup and the game essentially closed in me, losing all my progress, which was kind of annoying. Good stuff, but not worth the asking price until that's fixed.

1400064287|4.0|Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die, Chip Heath and Dan Heath, 2007. For those of us who struggle with marketing, this book offers a relatively straightforward recipe for creating more effective marketing strategies. The model the authors propose spells the word \\"SUCCESs\\": Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotions, and Stories, and they devote a chapter to each part of the model. OK, so maybe their spelling is a bit off, but their message is clear: for a message to stick, the audience needs to pay attention, understand and remember it, agree with and believe in it, care about it, and be able to act on it. Scattered throughout the book are clinics, real examples of messages that they analyze using their SUCCESs model and that helps the reader grasp the concepts in a very concrete way. At the end of the book is a Symptoms and Solutions section that reads like a Frequently Asked Questions and troubleshoots some of the typical problems we all run into when trying to get our message across.

1609611543|5.0|I've followed a Primal/Paleo diet for a year now and I bought this book the day it came out.  I forwarded a link to the book to every friend/family member in my contact list.  This book backs up what I've already been doing and made it even more evident that I am on the right track.  I am benefiting from the best health of my life by giving up wheat/gluten. Had blood tests done and my Dr. said my results are the best she's seen.  A few are because I do not eat processed foods!   For all the haters out there, what do you have to lose? Instead of bashing a book or a lifestyle, step up to the challenge. Take 30 days out of your life and see if you feel better. The first 3 weeks are hard, but then you will never want to eat processed foods again.
B000059RL3|5.0|I never saw the urgency to get this album...until I read Rolling Stone Magz Top 500 Albums. What's Going On ranked #6 and it got my attention. I only knew the title track and Mercy Mercy Me (from compilation CDs of course). Found two packaging of the album: normal 1 disc, and this deluxe ed. I decided to get the deluxe ed, and....it was absolutely worthed! The sound quality of 1st disc was great. Both stereo and the Detroit Mix. To be honest I love the Detroit Mix better than the stereo. The arrangement was much more itneresting.<br /><br />The 2nd disc, as many have mentioned here, was the concert version of the album. Very nice sound (considering the year it was produced). The inner sleeve was enjoyable, so many notes I love to read more than twice.<br /><br />Get this deluxe cd... you won't regret it.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|3 months after it was released finally I decided to buy this album, w/o expecting anything special. The title track is a 23 minutes long, divided into 6 parts (incl the overture), and this is the best track. Originally Yes song from 1980 but never properly recorded and officially released, they rearranged the song from standard 5 mins to 23 mins. Dunno if it was because it was written by Horn/ Downes (the vocal melody was so-Horn), or David's vocal really sounded like a young Horn. In really enjoyed this song.<br /><br />Other songs IMHO were ok. Some pop songs, some pop songs with interesting arrangement, some instrumental songs. Overall this is a very good band from a legendary band. Though it is not an album 'you-must-hear-now'. You can get it later.

0525423281|5.0|Excuse me while I fan-girl...<br />Okay. I'm finished. Not really, but I can't stop smiling! Lola and the Boy Next Door had even more hype leading up to its release than Anna and the French Kiss. I didn't think Lola could live up to Anna, but I was so excited when I got this book in the mail today that I ripped--really, I almost got a paper cut in my rush to open it--right into it. I finished this book in just one sitting.<br />First things first, I saw that it was signed to me, because my mother is amazing sometimes and ordered me a signed copy from Asheville, North Carolina, from the Lola book release party that I couldn't go to because of family problems. Fan-girl moment again, sorry--but second to that--I jumped right into Lola's world, and I fell in love.<br /><br />In a way, Lola had me missing Anna. Anna was such a funny, quiet character, and I loved her for it, while Lola was out there and in your face from the first page. But I grew to have a certain fondness of Lola that I only had a few times with Anna and that sealed the deal on this book for me.<br />Lola is that one girl you see from time-to-time, who is dressed so ridiculously that you can't help but to smile. Lola was out-going, brave, daring, and even a bit too much, if there is ever such a thing. But after a few pages, I loved her and wished she was my new best friend, and clothing designer.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins is amazing. She has blown me away and has left me dying for more; just like when I finished Anna and the France Kiss, I have a longing to be in the world her characters live in, and don't even get me started on Cricket Bell!<br />Cricket was, to put it simply, amazing. He was gorgeous, sweet (God--he was so darn sweet!) gorgeous, caring, gorgeous, smart... did I say gorgeous? Stop it, Angel--you're embarrassing yourself!<br />Cricket was the perfect male lead for our crazy-design-loving Lola. Throughout the book, Stephanie Perkins let us see how deeply he cares for Lola, and how Lola's feelings of hurt, embarrassment, abandonment, and anger of the past, slowly start to evolve  into the love she once had for him--the boy next door who only lives there sometimes.<br />I know it's hard to believe, but Cricket has actually taken my heart. Sorry, Etienne St. Clair! I didn't think it was possible to love a character as much as I did Cricket, and if you want to make things better--St. Clair and Cricket. Together, in the same scene--talking! Interacting! I know! Anna and St. Clair make a few brief cameos in Lola's story, and I have to say that I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Have in mind that this book is heavier than Anna. Emotionally speaking, I was way more invested than while I was reading Anna. I felt the characters had more depth, the issues were bigger--the world was seen through clear, bright eyes the whole time I was reading and I really connected with them. I actually loved every single character--even Lola's bad boy rocker boyfriend, Max--at least, I did until halfway through the book. You'll just have to read it and find out why!<br /><br />But--oh, no--did I just `but' in this review? Did I just put a `but' in here?!--I wish we could have seen more of Calliope, Cricket's twin sister. I loved her character even though she came across as snobby and indifferent most of the time when it came to Lola, I understood her. I have a brother who I am very protective over as well, so I know what it's like when you don't want your brother to get hurt. I can only hope we see more of her in the near future.<br /><br />All I can say is that this book is simply amazing. Is it better than Anna? Some say yes, some say no, but I am one of those who say `yes' a million times.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|I am an Opeth fan.  Based on the vocal style alone they are closest to a Death metal band, however, Opeth has always maintained certain qualities in the instrumentation that sets them a bit apart.  On the first album I ever picked up by them, Blackwater Park, the band constantly shifted between heavy distortion alongside death growls to acoustic ambiance and clean singing, often mutiple times in the same song.  Needless to say, they have always embodied a style that is unique to themselves.  On Heritage, they have taken an approach to their music that is a complete departure from anything else they've ever done.  There is no screaming on Heritage at all, but it is also not a repeat of Damnation.  In Heritage, I hear traces and influences from the likes of King Crimson, Frank Zappa, Jethro Tull, and at times Led Zeppelin.  If anything, it falls somewhere between the jazz fusion and acid rock styles of the 70s while still remaining quite Opethian.  In the documentaries leading up the albums release, Mikael Akerfeldt (primary singer, guitarist, and song writer for the band) said that he had written a few tracks that were most similar to the band's previous effort, Watershed, when he decided that it wasn't the type of music that appealed to him anymore and deleted all the music that had been had written and started over completely.  What came after that was Heritage.  I find that most albums can be grouped into one of four categories: ones that are disliked, ones that are catchy but lose their luster quite quickly, ones that are instant classics and stick with you for a long time, and ones that take a few listens to realize their brilliance.  I'm happy to say that this album fits into the latter category for me.  I listened to it a number of times, hoping to find something that is classic Opeth along the lines of Harvest or Damnation, but eventually gave up on the notion that this is anywhere near anything else they've released prior.  After finally getting the chance to listen to it from start to finish with no interruptions I realized what they were trying to do here and I must say I love it.  I've always appreciated it when, for better or worse, bands attempt something different than what is normal for them, and for Opeth it has paid off.  Although Heritage is not a concept album, the whole thing flows together like one exceptional song from start to finish.  Many tracks have almost no song structure and go in many directions never thought possible from any other Opeth album.  If you are an Opeth fan, a 70s rock fan, or just open-minded when it comes to music in general, I would highly suggest checking this out.  It is one of the most original albums I've heard in years and from a band that I already had high expectations of.
B005974CDU|5.0|I purposely held off posting a review of DT's newest album so that I could let the music sink in. Unlike say a movie, in my opinion music shouldn't be reviewed within minutes or hours of listening to the album for the first time. You really need to give an album of music space to breath. That said, to the review.   Not since Images and Words has a DT album energized and excited me as much as Dramatic Turn of Events has. This new album is signature Dream Theater. Had the guys simply put out \\"another\\" record for the sake of justifying why they wanted to continue on when Portnoy wanted to give the band a rest, I would have been devastated and ultimately, Portnoy's departure would have been validated. However, what Dream Theater has done is put together an album that dramatically and emphatically displays why they did not want the band to take a hiatus. It is actually the best possibly show of respect that they have not simply thrown an album together, but rather, validated with an exclamation point, why the remaining members took the stance they did and not go into mothballs as Portnoy wanted. I for one am glad \\"the spirit carries on.\\"  From top to bottom we get classic DT with the likes of \\"On The Backs of Angels\\", new twists such as \\"Build me up, break me down\\" and a first, three ballads; \\"This is the Life', \\"Far from Heaven\\" and \\"Beneath the Surface\\". The ballads showcase a melodic and thematic presence that they have only hinted at previously. \\"Lost not Forgotten\\", \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" and \\"Outcry\\", like \\"Angels\\" are classic Dream Theater with a dose of freshness. But I have yet to speak of, what is in my opinion, not only the albums best track, but arguably, the best song they have put together since Scenes from a Memory. That song is \\"Breaking all Illusions\\". Co-penned and arranged by Myung and Petrucci, this song is worth the price of the album alone. I can not begin to praise the re-engagement of John Myung into the writing process. He is actually credited throughout with the music, but this song has his stamp on it. James LeBrie is back providing lyrics with \\"Far from Heaven\\". It is a haunting song that has a poignancy and bitter sweet sorrow that bleeds through the speakers.   More than say the last 3 or 4 albums, this one feels like a group effort. Petrucci handled most of the lyrics, but still, the music and attitude reflect a team effort. I cannot wait to see what this new iteration has up it's sleeve for future releases. Until then, it will continue to stay in heavy rotation daily for me.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I haven't hooked up the xbox yet, but i'll update this. I travel ALOT and i do some gaming on my macbook, but it's just not the same as my xbox and not the same games.  This system is very well designed, minimalistic, and sharp looking. The screen is very nice. more than adequate for gaming on the road. it isn't as heavy feeling as i thought it would be (stock with no system in it yet). Yes it's a bit pricey, but its worth it in my opinion if you travel a lot. I already made a shoulder strap for it using some existing spring loaded swivel \\"D\\" hasps off an old shoulder strap. they go through the holes where you can put padlocks on the unit. Although the tabs are plastic, they are quite thick and i believe can support the weight of the unit with no problem. The good thing about having a strap connected through those quick release clips is that the latches cannot accidentally get opened in transit. I guess if those plastic tabs really aren't thick enough i'll be the first one to know it....Doh!  If you want to simplify powering it up you might want one of these   [[ASIN:B000234UFG Cables Unlimited PWR-PSLIB-2 Outlet Xtender Power Cord Splitter]]  that way you dont' have to worry about the unit's wall wart blocking up outlets. There's also plenty of room in the storage bags and they recommend putting the screen power adapter and an xbox controller in one side and the xbox gargantuan power brick in the other bag.   Thanks to the G155 instead of wasting time playing video games at home I can waste time on the road! Woo hoo!  Also this baby is going to the office....heh heh....  Update. I have used the unit with the Xbox, There is some audio noise as soon as you hook the HDMI cable, don't know why, but its there. Not present when you plug in the headphones however. The unit is hefty with the xbox 360, controller and power brick. I decided to get a nice compact flat folding handcard (available here of course) to wheel the unit and my book bag. This way you can carry the xobx and your personal item together with the mini handcard and not tire yourself out too badly. I highly recommend the folding carrier especially if you've ever had to book it through an airport in between flights. There was as single, rogue, stuck pixel on the screen (looks red to me) but it is only noticeable on a completely black screen and these sorts of things should be exptected now and then i suppose. That was the only flaw i found so far. Very happy with my purchase!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|This is my favorite Orphaned Land CD.  Love the integration of eastern and western instruments and vocals, etc.  Epic!  Recommended buy.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin Peaks is an exceptionally well-written and entertaining story that is beautifully filmed and executed with great acting, a gorgeous location, incredible storyline, sensational directing, and most important of all, an unbelievably perfect soundtrack and sound editing. I purchased it through Amazon and it was delivered in perfect condition and well ahead of schedule.
0062060554|5.0|This book has a great story line and is very well written. It will hold your interest until the last words. You think you will have guessed the ending several times before you get there and be surprised anyway. Read it and enjoy your time with Christine.

0525423281|5.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door was one of my most anticipated reads of 2011. I just knew, deep down, that it was going to be all kinds of awesome just like Anna and the French Kiss was. Let me tell you, Lola is just as good...maybe even better than Anna! WOWZERS!<br /><br />Lola is one unique character and she will always stand out in my mind as one of the most distinctive characters I've read in young adult literature. I loved her from the first page all of the way to the end. She never got on my nerves, I understood her thoughts and feelings, and she never did too many irrational (only a couple), spur of the moment type things in regards to boys.<br /><br />Many readers mention many young adult books have \\"missing/bad/uncaring parents.\\" Lola has two dads (also has a great detective/Nancy Drew loving bestie-had to mention this) who actually care about who their daughter dates and are active in her life...Lola got grounded a couple of time during her story. She does have a birth mother who has her problems and reminded me of my own mother. Lola at one point thought this:<br /><br />\\"Why is it so impossible for her to be a normal adult?\\"<br /><br />I practically have that same thought every day about my own mother.<br /><br />Now on to \\"the Boy Next Door\\"...Cricket. I know the name is crazy and out there (people have called my name crazy), but it works for him and I never thought his name to be outlandish while reading. He's just all sorts of awesomeness and is super sweet and shy. The romance in the story...perfect, sweet, adorable...I could go on and on! Cricket said the following...so you know he's the best guy around!<br /><br />\\"I know you aren't perfect. But it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for someone else.\\"<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins knows how to tell a story. She makes her stories unique by adding components such as ice skating (I watched tons of this as a child!), inventions, and costume wearing. She has become an author who I will pick up a book she's written without even caring what it's about. I read Lola in less than 24 hours...I was glued to this book!<br /><br />P.S. Fans of Anna and the French Kiss will be happy to know that Anna and St. Clair make numerous appearances throughout the book!la in less than 24 hours...I was glued to this book!   P.S. Fans of Anna and the French Kiss will be happy to know that Anna and St. Clair make numerous appearances throughout the book!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Such a brilliant idea!! This has completely changed my mornings!! Finally something that gets my groggy ass up in the morning!!
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|It was easy enough to get installed, running, and playing a new game within a few minutes.  Almost everything about the game was late 80's, early 90's style video gaming (graphics, sounds..  There is definitely a lot of reading with this style of game which can make it seem to drag on if you are looking to jump in and get playing.  Back when video games were just becoming popular a game like this would have been great, but 30 years later this does not seem to be something that should be targeted toward smartphone users  I would not recommend this game for anyone who wants a quick game that you can turn on during a break at work, sitting in their car...  I would recommend this game for anyone who likes old school gaming (Zelda), reading a whole story line, clicking a few buttons while letting the game do all the actual fighting and moving.
B001AXU1BY|5.0|My daughter loves the movie!  She is 8 years old.  I know that it may see a bit young, but she just sees the high school romance between Danny and Sandy.  She also loves the songs and sings along with the movie.  It's fun seeing her enjoy something my wife and I enjoyed and still enjoy, but now with her!
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|The art its its worst feature, as its a little immature. Otherwise however, the battle system is traditional and solid, as are the controls. Well worth checking out, and probably worth the three bucks.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Just when you think that Lady Antebellum can't get any better, they release their latest CD, \\"Own the Night.\\"  This record has a wide variety of songs that you can listen to over and over again.  The songs 'Just a Kiss' and 'Own the Night' are absolutely phenomenal and will go down as two of the best country songs to ever hit the radio.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, country music fan or not!

B0058ZPNOK|3.0|Hesher, like its titular character, is a bombastic, pitch-black, nihilistic and more or less repugnant film...that is not to say that it is not sometimes quite enjoyable. It is very well shot but not flashy and Levitt, as always, is reliable. Rainn Wilson stretches his acting muscles slightly, donning a grizzly beard, some lethargic sweats, and making us forget all about the kooky flair of 'Dwight.' Natalie Portman is fine in a role that could have largely been played by anyone, save a scene near the end when she brings a little more personality to her character symbolically. The real star of the film however is young TJ (Devin Brochu), who is equally agitated and enamored by Hesher, a force of black-metal nature who infiltrates his life with manic jams, bi-polar explosions and enough profanity to make John Waters wince.   This film is tenaciously vulgar, Hesher streaming vile language to a desensitizing degree. He even ends once exchange by saying. \\"One more thing--\\" before letting loose a giant fart. Shakespeare, this is not. However, there are several moments of rare and affecting poignancy sprinkled throughout scenes of selfish, useless destruction. The burnt/smashed cars, intimidation, etc etc are all anchored by young Brochu's mourning for his dead mother. Scenes involving the mother's car ring true and are welcome respites from Hesher's non-stop barrage of, well...Hesher. Without these sequences--particularly one late in the film where we see more of the family's relationship as it existed before the loss-- Hesher would be incredibly depressing.   In fact, it is still fairly depressing.   Hesher seemingly does his personal best to ensure this.   He is a cipher, a darkness, a lack of humanity.   For much of his screen time, he leers, smokes, grunts, moves with a rank primal energy.   We can't tell if he is an anti-hero or not...usually he is just reckless, depraved, and watchable. His metaphoric soliloquies (particularly the epically humorous and gross and tragic one at the funeral) are worth the price of admission alone.   It is a departure for Levitt, that is for sure, playing a character more akin to the haunted prostitute he played in Mysterious Skin than any films he has done lately. His character is a bruiser, a fairly unlikable wretch. And yet he gets the girl, he befriends the grandma, he rescues the kid...when he feels like it. The film which has trouble containing him is an unapologetic, drab, oft-intense and malicious picture. It is full of scratches, scars, and occasional shreds of understanding. There is an unrestrained power here, if you can handle the darkness, the brooding, the concussive expletive-heavy dialogue.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This game is going to consume my life I just know it. Harkens back to days of old. Really well done
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|All I can say is fun fun fun this game took me back in time. The game play is nice, and the game has a polished feel to it.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|First off the set is amazing and other than the cd\dvd's coming loose the packaging is very well done.  It's a typical Floyd box set and yes I could ask for more but what's new.  I'm a big fan of the SACD and DVD audio formats and truthfully I thought the 2003 SACD version of DSOFTM was bad...real bad.  the uncompressed 1974 quad recording blows the SACD\DVD audio version away...by miles.  The back speakers have a much better effect\mix and after 1 listen I felt like I heard the album for the very first time.  Hats off to anyone who had quadrophonic technology back in 1974..because it sounds awesome.  Yes it's a bit tinny and not as full as the SACD\DVD audio but it has an analog warmth to it and I couldn't imagine listening to it in any other format.  Had the boot version of Wembly for a long time and I'm glad they finally released it \\"offically\\", it sounds great.  Can't wait for Wish You Were Here....hopefully the release an Animals version amd what about an offical BBC release...
B0017SWPXY|4.0|While this book has been described as a tear-jerker by some, i shed only a single tear at best. But that does not mean it's not worth reading. This book kept my attention through every page. It's as much about the family as it is about the dog of that family. Highly Recommend.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Some are terribly easy and others make you scratch your head trying to figure out just what to do to get the level completed.  I like it and my 4yr old son likes it, so there's plenty of room for everyone to enjoy based on skill.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I was skeptical at first. I read the reviews, but since books are all about personal preference, the reviews weren't enough to convinve me at first. Finally I gave in and downloaded the book to my kindle. THIS MAY BE MY NEW FAVORITE BOOOK!!!! The challenges and heart break this family face are incredible, the book is well written, and at the end of it I was SOBBING even after i put down the kindle. I highly recommend reading this book despite any skepticism you may feel.
1932100660|5.0|This book was originally gifted to me by a friend who said, \\"Vickie, once you read this book, you will become vegetarian.\\" I purposely did not read the book as the holiday season was on the horizon and I wanted to make my coveted calzones. Well, the holidays passed and I read the book which to my surprise generated a personal epiphany and yes, I did become a vegetarian, taking my husband with me. I have since gifted the book to several friends, including my personal physician. Four years later, I'm still forever grateful to my friend and  to Dr. Campble. This book is a must read and a life saver to whom ever is willing to take the journey.
B0040JHL9U|3.0|Brooks is one of only a handful of shoemakers that make the 13B size that fits my feet. Unlike Nike, I can depend on Brooks to offer pretty much the same shoe year-after-year so I know what I'm getting when I order. These shoes have gotten very expensive, though. I usually buy last year's shoe at a discount, but no such luck this time. And they're all out of the blue that I wanted, so I had to pay full price for the sucky red.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|best rpg i've found yet. it doesn't crash like the others i've tried and is very easy to play. lucky i got it is the free app of the day but i'd totally pay $3 for it
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. it has great/cute graphics. keeps me interested and entertained. each level is unique and lacks redundancy
B0000026NC|2.0|This is a pretty terrible release.  I was a toddler when this tour was actually going on, but for me this CD is embarrassing and pretty good evidence of Pink Floyd's post-Waters doldrums.  None of the songs here are better than their album versions.  Gilmour sounds out of breath, or downright bored, on many of the tracks.  Of course, this was the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, so there's lots of material from that album, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you feel about those songs.  Classics like \\"Shine On\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" are passable-- in sharp contrast to their excellent studio counterparts.  The tracks from The Wall come across as obligatory, although the back-and-forth vocals on \\"Run Like Hell\\" are a nice touch.  I would wholeheartedly recommend David Gilmour's recent \\"Live in Gdansk\\" over this album-- it has many Pink Floyd classics performed with a lot more enthusiasm, including my favorite version of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond.\\"  Roger Waters' \\"In The Flesh\\" album is also surprisingly good, with a definitive version of \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" and a beautiful \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with a touching ending that I won't spoil.  This album steals two stars for reflecting the larger Pink Floyd legacy and for its historical significance.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|To say Mastodon are one of the best metal bands ever is kind of an understatement.  They are without a doubt one of the best bands in any genre today, and prove it 13 more times on new album The Hunter.  Let me begin by saying that I believe Remission and Leviathan are this band's best work, and that the heavier side of them is what's always drawn me more than the pretty side.  But if this is Mastodon's radio album or \\"sell out\\" piece, then bring it on, because this stuff rules!  It's catchy and infectious like a pop album but rages and rolls like only Mastodon can.  The vocals are incredible with a three headed hydra attack provided by Troy, Brent and Brann, featuring beautiful singing, hooky choruses, and roaring Masto-screams.  The singing is much more featured than the roars, but the heavy stuff is still there, just in moderation.  You'll be humming tracks like \\"Curl of the Burl\\" or \\"The Sparrow\\" in your sleep. Brann is still the best drummer in music, even if his fill heavy style is more lax than it used to be.  The riffs are gargantuan Masto-riffs, that invoke the thunder of the gods, the twang of the hillside and the snarl of the pit, all at the same time.  There are some strange moments and some songs seem a little disjointed, (The Creature Lives?!?), but it's the analogous likes of Sgt. Pepper, or Dark Side of the Moon, where songs exist for their own sake.  And I find the lack of some overarching story line refreshing.  It lets the band sit down and focus on songs for their own sake, not having to make pieces fit and tie loose ends.  This isn't the best Mastodon album, or the heaviest, but it has the right to exist and mingle with their other material in a free for all exchange that'll make live shows a rollercoaster!  Mastodon are definitely NOT exctinct.

My health has completely changed. My energy has changed, my concentration, my digestion, and my mood. I had no idea I could feel this good. People need to hear this message.

1601251505|2.0|The simple fact is under all the art and repackaging Pathfinder does not fix the fundamental flaw of D&D 3.5.  D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder both break down after level ten.  After level ten the Martial Characters start to become useless, they are underpowered compared to their Magic wielding peers.  I have yet to hear a reasoned rebuttal to this simple fact.<br />How does Pathfinder fix the balance problem faced by Martial Characters after 10th level? Please show me an adventuring Party 15th and above that included Magic wielders where the Fighter is the greatest deliver of damage? Show me an adventuring party that has a useful Rogue after 15th level?<br />I do respect Paizo as a game company, they have passion for the RPG industry and their products are always produced with love.  I just wish they actually revised the 3.5 rules more than they have to address the balancing problems after 10th level.<br />I am not into edition wars or Paizo vs WotC, I'll leave that to the fanboys.  D&D 4th edition whether you like it or hate it did address the balance problem at higher levels.  No matter what class you choose in D&D 4th there is an important and necessary  role for you in an adventuring party.
B004ZNARH4|1.0|\\"Why Pink Floyd\\", is what came to my mind as I pondered how great this set could have been.  Why include marbles and a scarf instead of the undoubtedly countless additional hours of material that must exist? Why require the Pink Floyd fan to pay over $100 to get the disc 6, the only unheard material for hardcore fans that are not interested in the surround sound, blue ray, etc..?  Why hit us with yet another reworking of the iconic cover we all love, when we would prefer to hear what remains in the vaults.    Then I come to an understanding...  Why?  Because Mason needs another new vintage Italian sports car.  Not surprising that he needs a second drummer to ghost for him on the rare occasion he bothers to play the kit.   Question answered.
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins did it again! Her second novel, and I love it MORE than the 1st one. Don't get me wrong. I LOVED Anna too! Lola more, because as well as getting to love a new character Lola. The supporting characters were.. Anna & St. Clair!! Win! I was a BIG fan of Anna & The French Kiss. So that was a very good thing for me!<br />The writing of Lola is amazing. So amazing that it is a one day book. I read this book as fast as I could (with 2 little ones hanging off my legs ;])!<br />Lola and the Boy Next Door was just the romantic lovey book that I needed. Add comedy, and bad boy, and the boy next door, and you have me hooked!<br />Lola is a unique person. With her wigs, sunglasses & funky style. You never know who she will be channeling that day.<br />With her Bad Boy, Rock Star boyfriend, Max. Lola feels she has it all. She is head over heels in love with Max, who is also much older than her. This is a problem with her parents. Nathan & Andy feel max is way to old & mature for her.<br />Lola and Max seem to be the perfect little couple.<br />Until a childhood friend & crush Cricket moves back in next door with his family and sister Calliope. Lola's nemesis!<br />Lola still remembers how things ended. When the Bell's moved. Those emotions are still fresh in her mind. Weighing heavy on her heart. Lola hasn't forgot.<br />With her stirring emotions for the boy next door. Lola is having a hard time convincing herself and Max that she don't have feelings for Cricket.<br />Through out the book Lola has a hard time finding herself. With allot of growing up to do. And some very hard issues to deal with. Lola takes all this head on. Finding herself. Fixing herself. And in the end, finding a love that she never really thought she deserved.<br />This was the perfect read I was looking for. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a book you will have trouble putting down. I feel in love with Cricket, (how could you not?) The boy next door! Who loved Lola, for who she was!
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|I am so disappointed with this movie.  \\"Creepy\\" animation says one child.  Spiritual element disturbing in it's mocking of worshipping Christ.

1451629184|3.0|ITs a pretty good book, I think she drags on about her animals a bit to much, and should of talked more about her experience and the reality of what happend... But overall its a very sad book, i recommend reading it, it makes you think twice about the people in and around your community, REMEMBER check your local \\"SEX OFFENDER LIST\\" there is one for every state just google it.  You can find out how close some of these people are to you , and tell you what these people were charged for (not in detail).
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way may not be your typical pop album but it was definitely made with a certain target audience in mind. The album includes a lot of catchy melodies and lyrics spanning a wide range of the musical spectrum. On this album you can find pop, rock, electro, retro, 80's and a whole lot more. It's clear Gaga was inspired by a lot when creating this masterpiece.  Personally this album speaks to who I am as a person and the beliefs I have. If you are a Gaga fan, this album will NOT disappoint! Personally, some of my favorite (non-single) tracks include: \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" \\"Bloody Mary\\" and \\"Bad Kids.\\" Every Gaga fan has their own favorite, and most of the time it's not the same exact track. Every track on this album has a purpose and message.  If you haven't given BORN THIS WAY a try yet, then you truly are missing out, musically and otherwise!

0307595862|2.0|The Snowman / Jo Nesbø<br /><br />I really wanted to like this novel.  I've been captivated by the Scandinavian thriller phenom that has put authors like Henning Mankell, Stieg Larsson, and Lars Kepler on international bestseller lists and the top of public library circulation logs.  Jo Nesbø is a Norwegian crime writer whose police inspector Harry Hole (last name is two syllables) is an interesting character.  Jo Nesbø has now written seven novels with Harry Hole, and while I may have missed some of the background to characters and context in the series by jumping in with The Snowman, the main difficulty I had seemed to be with the English translation.  When a novel \\"feels\\" like it's been translated from a foreign language, then there's an issue with the translation.  I felt that the novel was a slow-starter, and I think much of this has to do with the rough translation.  Sometimes it was fine, other times it was so clunky it felt like an unedited term paper.  I tried to collect some examples of weird translator errors which I've recorded below.  Isolated they don't seem to add up to much, but if you figure the narrative hobbles along with these and any many more awkward translations, it can make for pretty rough going.<br /><br />Things definitely got better as the novel progressed.  The reader's suspicions of the identity of the serial killer known as the Snowman shift from suspect to suspect so that any attempt at deductive reasoning is rather pointless by the end.  All in all it was an intricately crafted, but ultimately contrived plot with a complex climax that more than stretches credibility (spoilers:  how did he get all that snow upstairs when the windows were barred? And how did he himself get out of the room? And why didn't his wrist snap at Holmenkollen?).  So, okay, Stieg Larsson pushes the envelope too, but somehow it seemed just a smidgen more plausible.<br /><br />Here are some linguistic oddities that bothered me.<br /><br />\\"Isn't that dreadful?\\"<br />\\"Veritably, Mother.\\"  p117  I'm pretty sure there's a more current, less stilted word for this.<br /><br />\\"That sounds manifestly like you haven't caught the Snowman after all.  Is that right?\\" p190  poor translation?  Wrong word?<br /><br />Bjørn Holm rubbed his cutlet-shaped sideburns.  p194  -strange observation, are these mutton-chop sideburns?<br /><br />That was a long time ago.  Water under the bridge.  Scars under the skin.  Versicolor on the soul.  p239  unusual observation, and one I had to look up.  The other recurring term that was strange was \\"cochineal\\".  They're the small red beetles apparently, that make Macdonald's strawberry milkshakes red. Or was it meant to be French coccinelle, or ladybug, which would be a more common recognizable comparison, and one that might more likely be used to describe a human being?<br /><br />In the fields surrounding the farm the snow was in retreat.  Wet and gray, it squatted on the countryside it still occupied. p243  \\"squatted\\" seems like strange usage here, unless it means \\"squat\\" as in moving in illegally?<br /><br />The snow emitted soft, drawn-out screeches under his boots and the sharp daylight flashed against the sunglass-black windows as he approached. p309  I suppose snow might screech if it were cold enough... \\"sunglass-black\\" or tinted?  Solar? Solarized?<br /><br />He was unable to breathe; a steel wire seemed to tauten around his throat.  p327  \\"tauten\\"  really?  What about tighten?<br /><br /> \\"Do you believe it's true what they say about swans?\\" she asked.  \\"That they're faithful to each other until death do them part?\\"  p 379  This one has to be a typo, right?<br /><br />\\"Tell me, who should I see if I have Fahr's Syndrome?\\"<br />Silence.<br />\\"It depends,\\" answered Borghild hesitantly.<br />\\"On what?\\"<br />\\"On the syndrome your father has, I suppose.\\" p138  This is a joke that doesn't translate  Fahr's is homophonic with  fars (Norwegian \\"father's\\").  Could it have been translated so that the joke could be appreciated?  Or maybe at least explained in a footnote?I wonder how many more of these didn't make it into English.<br /><br />[Matthias, after a stint in the ER] \\"The high point was a boy who'd got a lemonade bottle stuck up his nose.  I told his mother he was probably too young to sniff Coke.\\"<br />p341  Okay, so the Norwegian word for carbonated soft drink is bruslimonade, but lemonade isn't the correct English translation.  The joke only makes sense if you translate it as \\"soft drink bottle\\" or \\"pop bottle\\".  This was definitely a translation error.hias, after a stint in the ER] \\"The high point was a boy who'd got a lemonade bottle stuck up his nose.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|The blu-ray picture quality is so clear on my parent's Full HD 50 inch plasma TV, it makes these three old movies look like they were made this year. The movie A New Hope is my favorite where all three actors and the two robots act like the funny Three Stooges and the Star Trek life-saving crew, and where every single person or robot in the movie is a survivor and a hero at the same time. If one of the five - person or robot - was suddenly left out in the movie, I would feel depressed and the movie title would instead become A New Hopeless in my imagination. Luckily, in the end of the movie, that feel-good feeling is so long-lasting when you see  all your five stars alive as a galactic team of superheroes in this movie and the following two movies in the trilogy.

0062068423|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  There is a huge tie-in with Norwegian history that caused me to begin a search of Quisling and others online.  I learned a lot about Norwegian history that I didn't know, in spite of the fact  that I am married to a Norwegian and have a lot family in Norway (I'm American).  This is a complicated book.  The plot shifts back and forth in time and in location.  Using Norwegian names makes it a bit more challenging.  I had to  make up a list of characters so that I could keep track.  Totally worth it.  This was one of the best crime/history novels I have ever read.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|I bought this show because I had a friend with similar tastes talk about how wonderful it is.  It is a good show, but in my opinion, it is not the best thing ever.  It's one of those shows where it's good to see once, but I didn't even keep the DVDs after watching them, because I wouldn't watch them again.  It was nice to have the set to watch all the way through one after the other, though.  As an added note, I wouldn't recommend watching it around children or adults who are offended by graphic material (and, of course if you are offended by it, I wouldn't recommend you watch it).  There is a lot of sexual content in these shows, and of course some blood and violence, too.  Overall, a good show, but I would recommend buying it used or on sale.  I know I got one season on sale for about 15 dollars at some point.

0316066524|3.0|Wow.  I guess I must start by confessing that I'm clearly not intelligent enough to fully understand and enjoy this novel.  To be more accurate, I may have the innate intelligence to do so, but am not willing to invest the time necessary.  Suffice it to say that David Foster Wallace is one highly evolved human being.<br /><br />That having been said, despite the fact that I was frequently adrift while working my way through what can be some pretty dense prose, there were kernels of brilliance that even I was able to appreciate.  The writing is magnificent and much of the underlying story (consisting of numerous threads, some of which I could not, for the life of me, connect until near the end of the book) is highly entertaining.  There are frequent references to organizations, acronyms and events which make absolutely no sense for hundreds of pages until an information dump occurs which suddenly brings things into sharp focus.<br /><br />For example, reference is early and often made to the Great Concavity.  By context, it slowly becomes clear that the term refers to some sort of territorial dispute between U.S. and Canada.  Finally, round about page 450, the entire history is hashed out in a very entertaining and illuminating fashion.<br /><br />The focus of the novel is a Boston tennis academy, the Incandenza family which founded the academy and whose children have passed through it, or are currently involved with it, and a nearby substance abuse treatment facility.  The story line jumps back and forth in and among several different story threads involving members of the Incandenza family, unrelated nearby residents and still other seemingly unconnected individuals and organizations.<br /><br />In Wallace's wacky alternate reality, the United States has elected an insane Vegas performer as President and the countries of Canada, Mexico and the U. S. have merged into a union of sorts.  The northeastern U. S. is ceded to Canada and used as a giant landfill for hazardous waste.  Through this backdrop is floating an incapacitating video, possession of which is greatly valued and sought by a Canadian (Quebecois) separatist group consisting of wheelchair bound amputees.  Wallace's world is at times bizarre, at others ridiculous and at still others, prescient.<br /><br />In what seems to be a trend among some of my more recently read novels, the book contains copious endnotes which run for pages at a time and contain the most bizarre and seemingly random information.  In any event, the book is certainly unusual and at times brilliant.  Even when read in a cursory manner, this book is a project.loating an incapacitating video, possession of which is greatly valued and sought by a Canadian (Quebecois) separatist group consisting of wheelchair bound amputees.

1419702203|5.0|\\"I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say.\\"  -- George Harrison, 1966<br /><br />This is without a doubt the most beautiful and longest awaited biography of George Harrison to date!<br /><br />As soon as this book became available, I ordered it immediately if not even sooner. I loved the previously unpublished photographs, such as that of 2-year-old George in the arms of his sister, Louise, then nearly 14.  I had to smile at tween George sunning himself with family friends, father Harold Sr. and brother Peter, in or about 1954.  I especially loved the picture of Louise and Harold Sr. at a dance in the late 1940s, a loving couple who literally welcomed George with love.<br /><br />It was such a treat to read about various Harrison family members.  It is plain and has been well documented that George was not only created by love, but was literally born into love.  From 1965-1969, Louise Harrison lent her voice to a column in a newsletter in a fan club newsletter honoring her son.<br /><br />Postcards George had written various friends and family members; sketches from his school workbooks all paint young George Harrison into sharper focus.  As a bonus treat, readers enjoy the inclusion of quotes by various family members, such as George's sisters-in-law, brothers, fellow Beatles and sundry friends.<br /><br />I have long thought George and Paul were the most interesting of the Beatles.  George's love for Eastern music and his life-long bond with Ravi Shankar, whom he met in 1965 is beautifully chronicled in this book.  George's home Friar Park is included, from its \\"evolution\\" to its finished state, metaphoric in that it parallels George's \\"evolution\\" to that of gardener, a passion he inherited from both Harold Sr. and Louise.<br /><br />You've just got to love seeing George, then 12 astride a motorcycle labeled \\"43\\" (as in 1943, perhaps), a future Formula One enthusiast.  The then-future Beatle would follow his love for \\"things fast,\\" as he would later sing in his 1979 gem, \\"Faster.\\"  In 1963, George, then 20 had a blast go-karting with his fellow Beatles, no doubt wishing his go-kart could be driven a tad faster.  George, artist extraordinare, humble gardener, author, father, husband, son, brother, uncle, complex iconic figure remained a boy at heart.<br /><br />One thing I've long wanted to explore was George's Catholic roots.  Louise French Harrison was Catholic and had George baptized when he was 1 month old.  George's Catholic roots remained with him for his entire life.  He had a beautiful statue of Blessed Mother Mary on the grounds of Friar Park.  While George explored Eastern religion and philosophy, he recognized that the precepts of all faiths are very similar.<br /><br />I will add that George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many.  A child with Asperger's, which is a form of autism who was a HUGE Beatles fan (George was this child's favorite) was a late talker.  Upon acquiring speech, this child would let George \\"talk\\" for her, using quotes from George's songs and lines he uttered in Beatle movies to express herself.  Over time, this evolved into her developing her own voice, so to speak.  George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many.  He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group.  Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not rare as one might otherwise think.<br /><br />This book is such a Godsend and I CAN'T WAIT for the dvd.  Olivia Arias Harrison, a beautiful, gracious lady has given the world a gift that will continue to give.  To make a good thing even better, she has included her input, which made this a much more effective body of work.  I can never thank her enough.<br /><br />This book is a MUST HAVE for all George Harrison fans.  Again, this book is a gift that will keep on giving.<br /><br />You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.rican Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.

B003VANOFY|3.0|When I first got this headset, I was worried that the battery life on these headphones wouldn't be adequate. At full charge, these offer 10 hours of life with 2 hours worth of charging. Not bad at all. The sound quality is great, has plenty of bass response, and it clear in reproducing highs and mids (especially for a gaming headset).  I have a problem, though. When I put the headset on, I can feel the back part of my ears touching the inside grate of the cans. It's incredibly annoying and, often times, my ears end up hurting because of the way it's pressing up against them. Had Logitech thought this through enough (along with the design: what the hell?), I would've given this product a perfect score. I'm seriously considering sending this back.  What a shame, such a stupid problem.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum, commonly referred to as \\"Lady A\\", steals the \\"Night\\" again with their third installment, \\"Own the Night\\".  Their previous albums \\"Lady Antebellum\\" and \\"Need You Now\\" have been certified multi-platinum, which Dave, Charles, and Hillary have left no reason this album will not do the same.  They've left no rocks unturned, and provided a unique sound that even non-country music lovers, have fallen in love with.  This can be explained by the 5 Grammy Awards they took home last year, among countless nominations for awards shows in every genre of music.  Dave, Charles, and Hillary have something that sets them apart from everyone else.  Not only does the talent of the vocals, and musical background show with each song they sing, their passion also shows through, along with the wonderful people they are on and off the stage.  From, Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott's lead vocals, to Dave Haywood's paino playing, guitar picking, mandolin playing, they're on fire with this new album.  \\"We Owned the Night\\" is a track that is powerful, yet in order to covey that, the vocals aren't overpowering.  It's a nice blend of all 3 with more of an upbeat sound.  For being the first song on the album, it immediately grabs you in and want to listen to more.  \\"Just a Kiss\\", the first released single from this record quickly gained its place in the books, as a Lady Antebellum classic, with high regards from critics and fans alike.  \\"Dancin' Away with My Heart\\" proves that even of a band of this magnitude can go back to younger roots, and re-live that first love we've all had but never forgotten.  \\"Friday Night\\" was a surprise with the first few licks, as it sounded more like a \\"rock\\" song.  The guitar is what makes the sound of this song, and with it's very upbeat, wordy lyrics, you will be jamming to it both in your living room, and live at a show.  \\"When You Were Mine\\" showcases Hillary's beautiful voice, and touches on a more sensitive side which I'm not sure I've heard inthis manner before... it's beautiful.  Charles and Hillary's voices fit perfectly together on this track.  \\"Cold as Stone\\" reminds me of some of the earlier racks from their debut self titled album.  If this is one you're drawn to, I would highly suggest you pick up their first album, because you'll love it.  \\"Singing me Home\\" is personally one of my favorite songs from this album.  I've had the privilege of hearing it live, acoustic, and can say as much as I love it on the album, it's even that much better live.  I love the vibe it has about it, with the mixture of different instrumentals you're maybe not used to hearing from them.  \\"Wanted You More\\" is a very powerful song, with powerful lyric, yet still remaining soft to the ears.  This is a beautifully arranged song, about love and the thought that it may not be the same for both people in the relationship.  \\"As You Turn Away\\" is a good follow-up to the previous song, with Hillary's voice as soft as I've heard yet.  She has such a tenderness in the beginning part of the song that makes you believe the lyrics she's speaking.  The song builds up greatly, adding Charles' vocals for a great sound.  The mix between soft, and powerful lyrics is such an amazing thing with this song.  \\"Love I've Found on You\\" picks up the pace again, starting with a solo on the drums setting the beat for the rest of the song.  This is a song where if you've found that special someone may end up leaving you in tears, like the song was written just for you.  \\"Somewhere Love Remains\\" is a beautiful song, an very appropriate in it's placement of the album.  The feel of the song is somewhere between the rest of them, very pleasant to the ears, very soft, traditional instruments.  It talks about finding the place in your relationship to fight for what you have.  \\"Heart of the World\\" is the last track on the album, and that's where it belongs.  I feel as if this song touches on many through the album, and it wraps them all up in one, and laysout the lyrics in a very soft and touching away.  Although, only their third album, Lady Antebellum has proved once again, they belong at the top of the charts.  Not only are they incredible vocalists, their musicians, and artists as well.  Charles, Hillary, and Dave have a very unique chemistry together that allows them the unique sound to not only please country music fans, but also fans of other genres of music.  Even if you've never listed to country music, or have proclaimed to not like it, give Lady Antebellum: Own the Night\\" a try, and I'm sure you'll come away having a respect for Lady A!

1609611543|5.0|Dr. Davis is spot on with the information he is disseminating to the country with his new book, Wheat Belly.  He is an experienced and well-respected cardiologist in his field who got sick and tired of treating patients who never got well.  After changing his approach to the dietary advice he was giving his patients, low and behold, their health collectively improved over and over and over again -- dramatic weight loss, drastically improved lipid profiles, resolution of certain autoimmune and digestive diseases, and the list goes on and on!    I am a medical professional as well, and everything he's proclaiming makes perfect sense to me.  I am changing the way I treat my patients and the kind of dietary advice I give them will change as well.  We have gone wheat free in my family and the results have been staggering.  Will I never eat a piece of bread or a or a dessert again in my life?  Of course I will!  And I will savor every bite when I occasionally do!  However, Dr. Davis has brought it to my realization that my family will no longer have wheat as a staple in their everyday diet.  As another reviewer put it, if we were meant to survive on wheat, we would be able to grind it with our teeth.  Pop a few wheat grains in your mouth one of these days and see how many broken teeth you end up with. It will make you stop and think.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|Wow! All I can say is... Wow!  I use this connected to the SPDIF output from a HTPC, conencted in turn to a HifiMeDIY TK2050 D-class amp. Using a spdif to 5.1 Digital Signal Processor resulted in a lot of hissing, ditto with using the analogue outs from the mobo.  Happy to report that there is next to zero hiss by using this marvellous little device, even at ear shattering levels of the amp.  Also, volume control works normally thu Windows 7, which is absolutely critical.  I agree with the reviewer found that 192KHz seems busted - liekwise with mine, the audio breaks up every few seconds. I kept it at 5 stars because 192KHz is a bit of overkill - if you really need it to be 192KHz, then don't go buying $30 DACs.  But for $35 or so, this has got to be the audio product of the year!
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I never download music from artists that I am passionate about online, ie Itunes, because I need the music and the case with the liner in the physical sense. I will only do a quick review here for my entry. Own the Night is Amazing.  It  gave me a wonderful experience as I got to speak music to my 3 year old daughter who is my constant companion and best friend.  She is also amazingly talented when it comes to having an ear for music.  I explained to her while lyrically the song may be a downer, like the ones that are about breakups, as a whole it is still a \\"beautiful\\" song.  And this album is full of those. There are a few surprises, some might even have been real chances to take, but I think Lady A completely nailed it. I was pleasantly surprised that Hillary got to take the lead on so many songs on this album.  While Charles has one of the best voices in music, as a woman, I adore songs that are spot on to how I feel, as Hillary's lead songs are. I don't think Dave get enough credit.  He is an AMAZING musician, and sometimes they can be overshadowed by the vocalists. If you are reading this as a review to help you decide on whether or not to buy the album, you are lucky that mine is the first.  Read no further, buy it.  Buy them all.
0316098329|4.0|I had no desire to read Emma Donahue's international bestseller, Room. I didn't give a hoot that it had been shortlisted for the Man Booker and Orange Prize, had won the Hughes & Hughes Irish Novel of the Year, the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, the Commonwealth Prize - Canada & Caribbean Region, and the Canadian Booksellers' Association Libris Awards - Fiction Book and Author of the Year. For me, a story narrated by a five-year-old who is held captive in a single room with his mother was not a place I wanted to visit. Especially in my fertile imagination, where there lurks a disturbing preponderancy for horrific after-shock.<br /><br />But when Room was chosen as the kick-off read this September for a book club I've belonged to for many years, I felt compelled to give it a try. Especially since I bought it for a screamin' deal at my local grocery store. Unsure whether this intervention was divine or satanic, I cracked open the covers.<br /><br />The story is told by Jack, in a voice that is at once persuasive, precocious and charming. To him, his world is not unusual and on this level the reader is introduced to all the things that delight, interest, bore, disgust and anger him. And when we view the 13-ft. square room that is his world from this perspective, it is not a scary, evil, dark or sinister place. The creep factor is on the secondary level. For this, Ms Donahue gets an A+. The tension between what Jack `sees' and what the reader `knows' is seismic.<br /><br />Narrating the story from a five-year-olds' perspective is at once daring and unique. No doubt this is one of the primary reasons the book has been so well-received. Authors like Ms Donahue who take risks; who push, pull and bend the novel in new and exciting ways are deserving of recognition and book sales, for they are the trailblazers of innovative narrative paths.<br /><br />For all I didn't want to read Room and for all I suffered alongside Ma in her reprehensible predicament, ultimately I was glad I persevered to the second half of the story. At this point, Ms Donahue switches gears and we see Jack and Ma enter a new phase. Believe me I couldn't flip the pages fast enough. Here, as Jack's preconceived notions about the world are turned upside down, stretched and questioned, mine were also.<br /><br />At every turn, Room is a testament of the tremendous love between a mother and son. In the end, Room is thrilling, but lives up to the claim Ms Donahue makes: it's not a nightmare narrative or a heartbreaker; it is a celebratory story of resilience.of the story.

B004L3AQFG|5.0|Wow is all I have to say about James Franco's acting in this film.  Franco goes far beyond those weed movie acting he is known to do and provides a completely inspiring role.  When you hear that a movie is going to be about a guy trapped in one place for 127 hours you tend to want nothign to do with it.  When was the last time a movie that takes place in one place about only one person been great?  Well this movie proves it can be.  The director does an amazing job pulling in snippets of the character's life.  The intensity of the climax of the movie is truly awe inspiring.  An absolutely must watch and a definite must for any movie collection.
B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|I just got done listening to three versions of Echoes and most of the rest of Meddle...from the 1992 Shine On box set, my 1974 Japanese vinyl copy (rendered in digital format through Audacity and the Apple Format AAC exporter)and the 2011 remaster.  My 1974 Japanese pressing still beats the pants off all the CD versions, including the 2011 remaster, but not everyone is going to find a copy...  So, there is a little improvement over the 1992 mastering(in my pedestrian opinion...I'm no Audio Jedi Master...) but not enough, in my opinion to justify replacing your Pink Floyd catalog.  On the other hand, the 2011 packaging is very nice, restoring something of the old LP approach and including a lot of pictures and text that were left off of other packages.  I'm a bit of a Pink Floyd fanatic, so I'm happy to have three copies of Meddle (and four or more of Wish You Were Here and Dark Side of the Moon), but I can't recommend that kind of obsession to everyone.
B003L77G10|5.0|I was impressed but not surprised to read that Tony-award winning playwrights do some of the scripts for THE GOOD WIFE. It's a very well crafted show, and I think it's easily the best of the year. Some episodes are better than others, and the whole show confuses being a lawyer with being a private detective; Alicia gets a disproportionate number of sympathetic PRO BONO clients -- but there's enough humor and cynicism to make up for these conventions. It also takes a lot of skill to keep Alicia's husband from ever seeming either crooked or honest, but always floating somewhere in between. I waited a year to get the series on DVD, rather than watch stray episodes at home and miss the continuity, and as soon as the set arrived, I had a wonderful week watching two or three episodes an evening. Now my only question is, how could anybody stand waiting during the commercials?
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|i love this game! it reminds me of my favorite rpgs of all time, FF2 &amp; FF3 on SNES. my only complaint is i wish there was keyboard support. im playing on Epic 4g running 2.3.4 leak. plays flawless. for those that complain about dialog, have u ever played an old school rpg? its suposed to be cheesy and over the top. good job. ill try the other rpg made by them after i beat this one.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In order to keep from sounding like a rambling geek, I will try to keep this review as brief as I can. *Minor spoilers are in this review.*    I picked up the preview for this book and within moments of finishing I realized that I must have more. After getting the book I went through it today and loved nearly every moment of it. The visual descriptions of bleak escapism into OASIS lends a poignant tone to the book, but is tempered by the almost abandonment of reality for the virtual world that has taken over. Chock-full of an absolutely amazing amount of 80's love, the little additions and shout outs were wonderful to work through. I almost felt like a gunter myself as I read the clues (and references) and followed along with our protagonist. The book had me laughing at many points, not only from the sheer genius it took to weave such pop references together, but to do so in a way that was both logical and entertaining for the reader. Many times today my reading was interrupted with questions about what I was laughing at.     The only criticism I had for the novel was the \\"true\\" Aech. It was strained in tone and delivery, reading much like the comments on Dumbledore that J.K. Rowling delivered after the completion of the book. The race and sexuality are not issues to me, but the delivery was. The entire affair felt unneeded and even the protagonist decided to keep thinking of her as \\"him\\". This treatment of the character added nothing to the story and felt tacked-on for the sake of it.    Even to the very last chapter, you can't help but root for the underdogs though. Is it something inherent to the supporters of underdogs? Gamer honor code(s)? Innate ethics of humanity? I'm not sure, but from the beginning to the very end I was firmly on the High Five team and practically cursing the sixers along with the characters.  Well-written, with hoards of trivia, references, and excellent tastes in some of the finer things of the 80's, this book is an absolute must-buy, must-read, and will continue to be such until the day the 80's are forgotten. 5/5
B005G4TJI4|5.0|People complain so much about the Transformer movies. Either you like it or you don't. Get over it... This movie has a lot of cool special effects and robots fighting, sounds pretty simple and true to what Transformers has always represented.  Also, for the 3-D bluray complaints, yeah that is all marketing, but at least they do include the $10 off the 3-D combo pack in the future. Who knows, some people might give those to friends down the road, so ask around at least.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Best album by far from Lady Antebellum-Lady A just keeps getting better and better!!!   Super vocals & harmonies on every cd they release.  Lady Antebellum has done it again and every song is incredible and they are UNSTOPPABLE!!!   I have been a fan of Lady A since the beginning and with music like this I will continue to be a fan.   I have a different favorite every time I listen to it. This cd has such heart warming music so go out and buy yours you won't be disappointed!
1609611543|5.0|After pouring through [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]], I have been devouring all of the books related to high-fat/low-carb dietary lifestyles (ironic, since such books are probably full of starches ;)), especially ones that cite and discuss research.   In Wheat Belly, Davis does an excellent job of citing pertinent research to support his claims, yet the writing is still clear and approachable to those not familiar with academia or scientific jargon. He does sprinkle efforts at humor throughout the book (a few puns and pop-culture references) which are cheezy, but I'll let them slide. I really enjoyed and appreciated his discussion of case studies of his own patients, and was amazed at the variety of problems he saw that simple dietary experimentation proved were linked somehow to wheat and other grains.   There is a short recipe section in the back, which I actually liked. Not necessarily because I will try the recipes, but because it gives the reader somewhere to go toward next after theyve finished the book. In other words, hes not saying, \\"Dont eat wheat! Good luck!\\" and leaving it at that; hes giving the reader some first steps that they can take once they make the decision to ditch the grain.  In summary, I think this book is a not only a fascinating discussion of wheat's problems specifically, but an overview of the entire low-carb movement. Its scientific research makes it a good book for someone who is skeptical of the movement, but is intimidated by the density of [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]].
B002X78QYA|5.0|Although not as well known as he deserved to be, Peter Maag was an outstanding conductor who particularly excelled at the music of Mendelssohn and Mozart. When his performance of Mendelssohn's \\"Scottish\\" Symphony was first released on an LP record decades ago it was recognized by many music lovers as the finest recording of this symphony available. And to many of us it still is. The only recording of this symphony which is comparable to Maag's performance is that by Ricardo Muti -- but, good as Muti's performance is, it does not exceed that by Maag. Mendelssohn's \\"Scottish\\" Symphony is a masterpiece which merits comparison with the symphonies of Beethoven. If you do not have it in your collection, please get this superb CD.

B0018QOIXU|5.0|I fell in love with Adele from her very first hit on her \\"19\\" album.  And then \\"21\\" came out and I immediately purchased it.  \\"21\\" is wonderful and clearly shows Adele evolving.  However, there's a raw honesty and youthfulness that she presents in \\"19\\" that makes this album more appealing to me.
0307586901|4.0|What a great resource. The book has several ideas from past Martha episodes and some that are included on her website. This book combines them all for a complete resource. The DIY Party Favors and \\"Bubble Favors\\" were probably my favorites. I love the idea of making things for a party, both as decoration and as a nice take home item. The ideas in here are pretty inexpensive and don't take a ton of \\"artsy talent,\\" so if you're usually not craft inclined I think you'll find several projects here that you can use. Other projects included knot bracelets (which are making a comeback) and several ideas for gift wrapping touches. There are ideas for virtually every holiday and budget.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Not too bad. I've seen better. The little dance that they do after you beat an opponent is very strange, but entertaining. Smooth game play on HTC Incredible. Classic 80's cheesy rpg with an anime twist. If you dig this kinda thing, it's very fun.

B000AGTPUU|4.0|I enjoyed the book as a kid, and this movie was very well done. Great animation, wonderful wintery setting that makes it feel like Christmas even if you watch it in July, and it's such a fun, exciting adventure to go on. It makes me, personally, feel like a little kid again while watching the children go on this train through a winter wonderland that apparently isn't 'real' in the sense that only the children can 'see' the whole thing. Not that I ever went on a train on Christmas Eve before, but I think you get my drift. All in all, this is sure to be a classic film just like the Rankin Bass TV specials 'Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer' and 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town'. The reason I gave it 4 stars, however, was due to the Santa Claus scenes in the movie. Now, I'm not against Santa, but in this film, he came across as this god-like figure. Examples: His beard was glowing like maybe an angel's face would - a symbol of holiness?; He had an air of 'all-knowing' and 'understanding' about him that really reminded me of the person of God. Santa, in this movie, was portrayed as this deity being who was worshiped by his imp-sounding elves, who, upon the entry of the 'Big' Man' into the town square, all sang a verse from 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town', which was pretty eerie; it reminded me of some hymnal chant? It was more disturbing than exciting I must say. But besides that, this film is full of cinema magic from the music to the animation to the story, it all makes it feel like Christmas every time you watch it.
030745455X|5.0|This second book did not disappoint!  This is definitely worth the read.  I can not wait for the last one!

B005COO1X6|4.0|I haven't read Stephen King in a long time - but this purchase was a pleasurable surprise.  For the first 60-70% of the story I was intrigued by the vidid descriptions of the people and places - and found that very intersting (story one if you will).  Story two starts when it this story gets wierd ala Stephen King.  The wierd I did not enjoy as much - but all the way up until the driver of the Prius stuck his hand in the door of the station wagon I thought was excellent story telling.  Following that, the story was good but not as much to my interest.  Never the less - I couldn't put the story down until I read from top to bottom!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My kids love this game. Even though 99&cent; is a good deal, free is better. Lol. Awesome game and app!

0553801473|1.0|Apparently George no longer does.  I once saw a movie in which the protagonist is a revered novelist with fans eagerly awaiting his next book.  Unfortanately for them this author has created not a novel but a hideaus bloated thing he carries around in a box.  Fast forward, our hero accidentally dumps the box causing his multi-thousand limbed monstrosity to be scattered by the winds.  And then he goes on to redeem himself and his career with a much tighter better written story.  After reading these last two books, I wish GRRM could have done the same.  Adjectives that come to mind, bloated, long-winded and just plain puffy.  If I wrote like GRRM I might even use turgid. Does his editor even make recomendations? Or just hit it with the OK stamp as it rolls by? By far the biggest disappointment was Dany, I mean really, my teenage daughter doesn't have such angst and indecisiveness. Buy it out of curiosity but don't expect the same feeling from the leaner, meaner first three novels.  Disappointed does not begin to describe my feelings on this book.
B003H9M1QM|3.0|This was a gift for my Grandson. I was embarassed to learn it arrived all mangled and the case broken. The discs were ok but since it's a special edition they like the cover and case to be intact. Hopefully they can figure out how to exchange without too much hassel.
B0041KOVNM|5.0|This album is great!  Really like the clean vocals and the music is simple and very catchy.  Even though the lyrics are laughable for me, of course they fit the music very well.  Ghost is probably a side project from people in more popular bands.  The only reason I can think they are hiding behind masks and robes.  Or maybe they are hiding from their parents?? Anyways, great album and I suggest you listen and see for yourself.
0441013597|4.0|This review discusses Frank Herbert's six Dune novels.<br /><br />Dune, the first novel, is a classic work of science fiction.  It manages to effortlessly convey a future where humans have created an interstellar empire with planetary fiefdoms controlled by noble houses.  Interplanetary travel is provided by the Spacing Guild, whose Navigators rely on \\"the spice,\\" or \\"m&eacute;lange,\\" to pilot ships instantaneously from planet to planet.  M&eacute;lange is found only on the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, and is also crucial for the survival of the powerful matriarchal order of the Bene Gesserit, whose members get advanced physical and mental abilities from the spice as well as through special training and conditioning.  The novel recounts the coming of Duke Leto Atreides and his family to Dune.  Unfortunately, life on Dune is not easy for the Atreides, and the choices of the Duke's son, Paul, and Paul's children shape the future, as detailed in the next five books.<br /><br />I started reading the Dune saga almost two and a half years ago, and only just finished the final book, which takes place around five thousand years after Dune.  Usually when I read a series the author has already completed, I find myself picking up the next book instantly because I cannot wait to see what happens next.  With the Dune series, I often felt so exhausted after finishing one book that I waited months before picking up the next one.  It is not that the books aren't exciting or that I wasn't interested in learning what happened next, but somehow getting through each Dune book took an immense amount of effort, and each book seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to finish.  Perhaps this was because the books are packed with dialogue and philosophical discussions, but, for the most part, not many actions scenes.  This may seem like I don't recommend reading the books, but I do.  I really do.  Especially the first one.<br /><br />Not only does Dune reveal a universe in the far distant future, it offers a different take on that universe than most other science fiction novels.  Instead of the classic model where computers and artificial intelligence control daily existence, Frank Herbert created a world in an era after humans decided to destroy all computers and artificial intelligences.  Humans had to adapt and rely on themselves to perform the functions that we are already accustomed to leaving to computers.  For example, the Spacing Guild specialized in mathematics, and special training gives some humans the ability to calculate and logically reason better than any computer could.<br /><br />Dune also champions environmentalism.  It explores the idea of a planet as a complex living ecosystem functioning as a whole.  The Fremen on Dune recognize that if they want to change their planet from a desert planet to a verdant one, they must alter the entire ecology of the planet.  They also realize that they must balance their desire for water and greenery with the needs of the great sandworms, which are critical to spice production and which cannot survive in or near water.  Frank Herbert also extensively details the adaptation of life to Dune's arid conditions.  In addition to the sandworms that require arid conditions, Dune boasts kangaroo mice that have learned to live with limited water.  The Fremen too have developed methods of sealing their residences and their bodies to conserve water, and they even reclaim water from the dead.<br /><br />Frank Herbert has created a fascinating world full of intrigue, philosophy, and mysticism.  He explores politics, empire building, and the advent of new religions.  Try the first one, and if it appeals to you, go on to the second.  The other four are not quite as good, but still worth the read if the world of Dune intrigues you.  For my part, I think I'll eventually read the two sequels co-written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.  I'm not sure if I'll go so far as to explore the prequels and interquels though...<br /><br />For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf.y blog, Life Off the Shelf.
0553386794|5.0|In my view, A Song of Ice and Fire has risen into the pantheon of great fantasy works, right alongside J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.  Martin's characters are richly drawn, making the reader truly care for them, so when tragedy strikes one of the most endearing characters in A Game of Thrones, the impact is profound.  I adored this novel.
0812979656|5.0|The God of Small Things is a book about what happens to a set of \\"two egg\\" twins, Estha and Rahel, after the death of their cousin, Sophie Mol.  It is also a story about what happened before.  Sophie Mol's funeral takes place in the first few pages, but it is not until the end that we fully learn the circumstances surrounding her death and its aftermath.  Instead, a sense of foreboding permeates the novel as Roy slowly reveals snippets of the story while describing a set of damaged twins twenty-four years later.<br /><br />The story alternates between two time periods:  the twins at seven and the twins at thirty-one.  At seven, the twins are inseparable, thinking of themselves as unit.  At thirty-one, they have been separated for twenty-four years and Estha rarely speaks, while Rahel feels hollow inside.  There is a sense that this is due to the twins' lingering guilt and grief, but the extent of those feelings is not apparent until the final pages.<br /><br />The most striking part of this novel is the author's use of language.  Roy does not feel bound by the constraints of grammar, but molds language to serve her needs.  In doing so, she eloquently conveys the tumultuous thoughts running through the children's heads, and, indeed, at times reading the novel is like reading Estha's and Rahel's thoughts.  Roy uses the language to reveal their private games and ideas, and their feelings in various circumstances, like when they get in trouble.  For example, when the twins' mother scolds them, Roy capitalizes and splits up words to show how Estha and Rahel interpret that scolding.  A statement that their mother will discuss their behavior with them later becomes \\"Lay. Ter.\\" in the children's minds, emphasizing how they dread that conversation and recognize their mother's displeasure.<br /><br />Towards the end of the novel, Roy also describes how in Malayalam, the native language for the part of southern India where the twins reside, the end of one word blends with the next.  This explains why Estha and Rahel think of the owl that lives in their family's pickling plant as \\"a nowl.\\"  Again, these word games help us connect to the children and understand how they see the world.<br /><br />The novel is worth reading for the language alone, but Roy's method of storytelling also makes for a unique reading experience.  While reading this book, I definitely did not feel like the story was one that had been told many times before, and because I felt so connected to the characters' thoughts, I could not wait to find out exactly what happened to turn two innocent seven year olds into two damaged thirty-one year olds.  I would definitely recommend picking up this book for an interesting read, especially if you are looking for something different.<br /><br />For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf.and Rahel think of the owl that lives in their family's pickling plant as \\"a nowl.\\"  Again, these word games help us connect to the children and understand how they see the world.

0670022411|5.0|Well I'll say right off Im not as smart or a tenth as educated as the author. So I loved it.  I liked all the detail of the houses and clothes and tea and lunch.  All those details do take you into the world of the characters and let you live for a bit somewhere else.  I loved the details of Oxford and France, places I'll never get to see or experience myself.  And that's why I read anyway.  Sure as many people here already criticized, the heroine is a bit slow on the uptake to get into using her gifts but I didn't feel it was unrealistic.  She had stuff to get over and fear is a huge hurdle for most of us.  This wasn't a book about perfect people who do superhero feats with no issues of conscious, it was more kinda normal people with wounds, history, habits and drawbacks of character to get over and through.  I loved all the references to historical people and places as most I'd heard of but really didn't know anything about and so if the author got anything wrong, I didn't really care, it was still interesting.  I never liked books where the characters never got tired or needed to pee.  I can tell it's a first novel, there are a few places I would hope will show improvement, but the first in a trilogy has a lot of backstory and setting the stage and tone for the next books to build off of.  Sure we can all criticize things but for me the best mark of a well written book is that I head into it and don't want to come out.  And am unhappy when it ends and I have to wait for the next one.  This one was definitely that for me, I was sorry to see it end and will buy a copy to read again before the next one comes out. Well done Deborah, I bet you are a great person to have as a teacher.
0060853972|5.0|About a month ago, I was wandering through the stacks at our local public library and this book caught my eye. I recognized the title, and after reading the book description and some of the review blurbs, I decided this would be my next adventure. I had never heard of this book before and, apparently, that either means that (1) I've been living under a rock, (2) I am just not cool enough to be \\"in the know,\\" or (3  and this is the most probable) both. Comments from the authors that were included in the book stated that they love signing copies of this book because every copy looks like it has gone through hell--bindings falling off, bindings missing, water logged, torn, held together with rubber bands, you name it. And every fan explains how much the book means to him or her and to what lengths he or she has gone to take it places, loan it out, get it back, and re-read it over and over again. My copy was much less storied--it was still quite pristine in its hardcover binding. Perhaps people are careful with library books after all? Or maybe the library had just been forced to replace it recently!<br /><br />Wikipedia can give you a very nice plot summary. I will just go so far as to say the book is about the apocalypse and the coming of the Anti-Christ. But not the apocalypse as you could ever have imagined it. It is hilarious and full of fantastic characters, like the demon and angel who each have, respectively, become less demonic and less angelic since Eve ate the apple, the Satanic nuns who accidentally give the Anti-Christ to the wrong people so that everyone thinks the wrong boy is the Anti-Christ, the witch who is following the very accurate prophecies of her ancestor, and a novice witch hunter.<br /><br />The book is very well-written and the authors draw you into the story so that it is difficult to put down. And, as I've already mentioned, it really is hilarious. So if you're looking for a pretty easy and amusing read or want to read something incredibly original, this is the book to pick to pick up. I can definitely see why it made the list and why, even though I personally don't feel the need to read it over and over again, it has become a cult classic.<br /><br />For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf.book to pick to pick up.

B0000630YA|1.0|I wanted to give this disk 5 stars.  I really did. Unfortunately it is unplayable on either one of my computers.  That's right, it just spins for a bit and gets spit right back out.  You see I could have bought this from another service (I'm sure you can guess which one) but their version replaced some full length songs with the shorter singles versions. Classic cuts like this shouldn't be cut short.  Short is better than nothing though.  I'm afraid I've run into Atlantic Records dreaded DRM practices with this disk.  I've basically purchased a worthless product.  I can't play it in the format I purchased it it.  At the least I'd call it defective.  At the worst I'd call it fraud.
0143118706|1.0|She does not love Felipe. As a matter of fact, she does not even understand what love is. Honestly, her personality is strongly affected by bipolar disorder (undiagnosed?) and continuous search for excitement without deep feelings or involvement on any level. I have a hard time even to understand what keeps her and Felipe together. It seems that she is afraid to admit that the thrill is over, but there are not so many exciting men around when you are in your forties and look at least five years older.Sorry, but I never in my life met a woman that did not want to be a mother...it is a true pathology.

0345349571|5.0|Barbara W. Tuchman won two Pulitzer Prizes, for GUNS OF AUGUST (1962) and STILWELL AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, 1911-45 (1970). My Encyclopedia Britannica says, \\"It then took her seven years to research and write A DISTANT MIRROR: THE CALAMITOUS 14TH CENTURY (1978), which some critics considered her most original and profound work; it attempted to reanimate the character and feel of life in 14th-century France, when most primary sources from the time tended to be chronicles or tributes, with little evidence of real personalities.\\"<br /><br />A DISTANT MIRROR reflects images of many colorful personalities, but Tuchman uses one person to move her story along. This is Enguerrand VII de Coucy, a prominent French noble and knight who fought in many battles, who married a daughter of English king Edward III, and who served as agent and aide to French king Charles VI. This is not, however, a biography. It is an easy-to-read narrative about 14th-century France with significant attention given also to England and Italy. Bits and pieces about other countries are here too, and Holy Roman Emperors Charles IV and Wenceslas enter the picture.<br /><br />Major topics are the 100 Years War, the Black Death, Henry II of England, Charles VI of France, Christianity, and the Schism, a time when there were two and briefly even three popes. A few of the many other topics that receive at least anecdotal coverage are John Wycliffe, Geoffrey Chaucer, flagellant fanatics, entranced dancers, companies of brigands, Brethren of the Free Spirit, Catherine of Siena, the See in Avignon, and violent Pope Urban VI. Because some topics stretch into the 15th century, she ties up those loose ends in her \\"Epilog.\\"<br /><br />Normally I despise passages of descriptive detail. They are slow. Tuchman includes some, but no more than 5% of her content, and they are necessary to immerse the reader into the environment. Notes and bibliography are plentiful, and the maps and index were helpful. The book has many plates of 14th-century art, though I think only the hardcover editions have any in color.

B004ZNACA6|2.0|This is my very first Amazon \\"review\\" or rant.  How can they ship these CDs in mini-LP style paper jackets when they simply omit the antistatic sleeves the Japanese OBI CDs come with by default?  How can they be this cheap?  Shame on whoever made this decision.  It cost me another $20 to order 50 inner sleeves (Japanese) from Ebay just to equip my newly purchased \\"DISCOVERY\\" CDs.  EPIC FAIL!  The Dark Side Of The Moon Immersion Set is the same way, BTW, which is a bigger ripoff in my book.  But wait, I did get coasters and Chinese-made glass-balls with my order.  Except my CDs would get surface scratches every time I dare removing them for listening.<br /><br />If I didn't like the music this much, I'd return the whole thing.  I still may.  This is pathetic.
B005ARYEY6|4.0|Columbia has done mostly a good job of repackaging Miles Davis in authoritative boxsets that are more-or-less complete.  These 3 CD's improve on bootleg CD's in sound quality and completeness (the first two Paris tracks have never been issued).  But the DVD of the Karlsruhe performance features four compositions (plus \\"the theme\\"), while another DVD issue of this concert also includes a 9:16 performance of \\"Walkin'\\" (and a few seconds of Hancock's piano intro to \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\"), as does the big kitchen-sink Miles Davis Columbia box set.  I understand that the estate of Richard Carpenter (not Karen's brother) demanded big bucks and Sony/Columbia wouldn't play ball.  So be it, but you'll not find a word about this anywhere in the package.  Note that \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\" is the only performance that was not edited for the TV broadcast that Columbia used for the DVD.  There's no legit issue of this full concert.)  I'm very glad to have this package, and I'm glad Columbia has issued music in a systematic fashion (even if it means I've purchased KIND OF BLUE in at least five formats) -- but it's still disappointing that Columbia has not done this right.  Funny, I just noticed that the credits at the end of the DVD, apparently from the 2009 box set, do list \\"Walkin' written by Richard Carpenter\\" -- oops.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|I think I am the biggest Lad A Fan! And as a fan, I think they keep getting better. This third CD is the best yet! Cold as Stone has to be my favorite song in this album. This album shows how much they have grown and how great their voices are. I can't wait until i see them live for the 5th time.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I think this box set could have been a bit better.  Here's a couple of reasons why:  1. There is a version of Dark Side Of The Moon called Eclipse from a show they did I think at the Rainbow Theater in '72 for the BBC.  This was a totally different version, especially The Great Gig In The Sky.  I would have loved to have the complete version (without Us and Them cut) of this show on another CD.  2. Since this is an Immersion Box set, they should have included all the posters, postcards etc. from the original album release.  Otherwise, a really good box set, but in my opinion, not a great box set.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I chose to write a review on this book as it is by far the most polarizing in the series.  Yes, it is graphic.  Yes, the war that takes place is violent and political.  For these reasons many feel the book is \\"realistic.\\"  I disagree.  There is a continuing trend in our culture to create dark works of fiction and sell them to teens and young adults, while omitting anything that resembles human sexuality in order to maintain a \\"PG-13\\" feel.  Why violence is acceptable for teen consumption and human sexuality is not should be of great concern to parents.  One is a healthy part of growing up and should be explored in an effort to engage teens in an honest conversation about their sexuality.  Instead, we are creating teen love stories that rival the unrealistic expectations one would find in a Walt Disney fairy tale, yet using violence as a backdrop for romance.  This may explain why so many people were disappointed when Mockingjay's ending suddenly trailed from this expectation.  After all, the book unabashedly engages the reader in unimaginable violence, yet the characters don't curse and don't engage in anything other than chaste love scenes.  Indeed, these chaste love scenes were at the heart of each of the books, which in turn created expectations about how the series should end.  Also, after leaving the reader drained, the author only dedicates a couple of paragraphs to Katniss's journey back from despair.  I think it would have been far more realistic for the reader to experience her emotional journey back, as well as her reconnection with Peeta (and how the war changed them and their love).  Instead, the ending felt rushed and trite.  If anyone is interested in exploring our culture's paradoxical nature when it comes to violence and sex, I highly recommend viewing the documentary \\"This Film is Not Yet Rated.\\"  As a parent, I feel strongly that this book is not suitable for 7th grade and up as indicated in its reviews.  Thank you.
0439023521|3.0|This book was ok I know this is aimed toward kids/teens. Im in my 20s and read it, first I will say to all the parents out there the violence in this book is crazy sort of like a horror type stuff..goes into details.. I would not let a kid read it, its disturbing imo. If you care what your kid reads might want to pass on this, if you dont care  skip this warning.  The book was ok imo, I feel like the story is tooooooooooooo long when it shouldnt have to be in this case, I did get into it tho..I kept wondering whats going to happen next. I did get bored towards the end of the book (since its not and ending story) I did not enjoy all the Graphic violence/gore...   so heres my thoughts on the book the start was cute, the middle was creepy, and the end just was flat.  I know I can buy another book to continue but the ending didnt grip me so I dont care for it.
0061537969|4.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" puts into words the actions and emotions I've witnessed in the five Cocker Spaniels we've had in the past 26 years.  You know that dogs have the ability to feel, sense and emote when you see them.  They comfort you when they know you are hurting, they wait and rejoice when you know they want to play.  I truly enjoyed this book and shed a few tears at the end when it was the dog's time to move on.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|We're smack in the middle of Banned Books Week Sept 24 - Oct 1 2011, and I'm thrilled that one of my all-time favorite YA novels (which often gets challenged for sexuality and profane language) is being made into a film. This is probably one of the few books in the YA genre I read when I was actually a teen. It's in the format of letters written to a friend from the main character Charlie. As he deals with high school & life in general, he touches you to the bone with his descriptions and explanations of his innermost thoughts and feelings. There are perks to being a wallflower, as Charlie most certainly is, but participation has its infinite possibilities too. I loved it and even though its confessional intimacy made me freak out a little, I was able to completely relate to Charlie's withdrawal, confusion, and fear. I \\"feel infinite\\" when i think about it:)
0375826742|5.0|Because the next and last book in this series is coming out in Nov, 2011, I have just finished reading Brisinger again.  This is the only book I have ever read twice, but all the information about Eragon, Brom, Eldunari, and everything and everyone else was important  and I wanted it fresh in my mind.  I am not young, but I have been reading fantasy/magic/sword and sorcery for the better part of 40 years.  Dragons have always been my favorite.  This has been a such a wonderful fantasy to read and live.  I enjoy the way Chris  describes every single item.  Whether it's a flower or a rock, it makes it real for me.  I am seeing all through my minds' eye.  The smells, the sights, the feelings, everything is right there, as if I could touch it or see it or feel it.  I am there.  That is  what I want from an author.  Take me there.  Make me experience exactly what is happening.  I loved it and have pre-ordered the next book and wait with a child-like anticipation for it's delivery.  Enjoy!
B000FA5TTW|2.0|I stop reading books if I'm not grabbed within the first couple pages or at least within the first chapter.  I was tricked with this book.  I thought after downloading and devouring the preview of this book I'd stumbled across a winner, but after purchasing I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Let me sum it up for you.  Girl is abducted and killed, family is forever altered and messed up, dead child has weird experiences on the other side.  I like movies and books that take on a challenging and devastating topic, but this book lacked any redeeming quality.  If you like to take a look into someones messed up life, and enjoy a beginning but no destination, you will love this book.  Save yourself a miserable journey and find another way to depress yourself.

1400049628|5.0|I need to log some therapy hours to figure it out, but I love the idea of myself being the only person left on the earth.  Wandering through stores, driving cars I'd never afford, and my grand dream of driving a bulldozer through an exceptionally nice house.

It's a no brainer... read this book, especially if you have thoughts of taking on humanity one zombie at a time.

I personally love to jam to Friday Night.  But what really gets me are the harmonies and strings in Heart of the World.  I can always tell that I'm loving an entire album when I don't have to skip a track and just let it play all the way through.  Thanks Lady A.  Keep 'em coming!
1574216988|5.0|This is another winner from Sandy for the art of Zentangle. With beautiful examples and wonderful ideas this book provides ample samples of great art work and tangles for anyone who loves to tangle. If you liked Totally Tangled, you will love this book. It's packed with awe inspiring ideas, tangles, and artwork to get you motivated to create your own art work using Zen Tangling. It's a fun, inspiring work that is just as good as the first book. I really liked the section on rock art. She really puts her heart and soul in the books and they are refreshing and fun to read. Each time I look at the book, I see something I missed before. Great book!!
0670021652|3.0|I was very curious to see how Elizabeth Gilbert, our bohemian, man-loving, commitment-fearing, young woman would take to marriage to her beloved Felipe. I rather enjoyed her therapeutic trek following her divorce and ill-fated affair as chronicled in Eat Pray Love and wanted more. Just how did life with Felipe work out after they finally got out of bed and faced up to reality? Well, I was disappointed!  She offered us a few tasty morsels of real life with Felipe--Homeland Security's quest to deport the undocumented Felipe stressed them both out, traveling with Felipe showed us some of the reality of relationships (I enjoyed their bus ride), and some of her discussions with Felipe were enlightening. I liked Felipe's humble admissions regarding money and booze (he has always been good at making money but not at saving it and he drinks too much wine). Now this is a dose of reality (from her personal life). But I stress these were moments in a much larger view of marriage--the anthropologist's or the feminist's look at marriage encompassed most of the book and I found it to be draining and depressing for the most part.   Her basic premise is that marriage is not what it's cracked up to be and it's worse for women. She has plenty of recent interviews and historical information to back her up. But it's mind-numbing. I'm a widow. When I was married, it could be heaven, it could be hell--most spouses have said the words, \\"I could kill you!\\" But I used to love to read Judith Viorist's book Marriage is Better (I think it was called) because it emphasized the fact that you can want to kill him one day and the next day you're so glad that you didn't!  Had I picked up Gilbert's book Committed on a bad day, I would have ended up more depressed because she manages to find a multitude of negative information about marriage. For example, supposedly during the Great Depression when poverty-stricken spouses were unhappy they carved out their own separations by splitting their houses into two with bed sheets. This is to show us that when people say that in the olden days divorce was rare and people stayed in love forever that this was just a facade. Maybe so for some people. I recently saw an article in the paper about a couple who had been married for seventy years and were still in love and helping one another through the trials and tribulations of old age. This is the sort of thing that makes you feel good about the power of human love.    I suppose some people might feel that Gilbert's cautionary tale will teach them about what they are getting into when they say \\"I do.\\" But this book isn't an upper. It's basically a downer because she paints such a sad picture of the institution of marriage.   Granted, she says that Felipe tells her that they're free-thinking enough to craft their own kind of marriage. And she's hoping that this is true (but still feels that they could end up divorced). Maybe some would say that she is a realist. But all this doom and gloom makes for a tiresome read. I'm giving it three stars because I still say that she knows how to write. But then no one would deny that Shakespeare could write either, and yet he was a master of doom and gloom himself.

B0039UTDA6|4.0|BBC Life documentary is great, cinematography is really fantastic. The american version is narrated by Oprah Winfrey, and while she does a good job, she fades in comparison to David Attenborough who narrated the British version. I am not sure why they've changed the narration in the American version, but having watched the American version, and several minutes of the British version, I got the impression that the American narration was simplified, and the evolution was de-emphasized, maybe to make the series appeal to a broader audience.  Great documentary overall, highly recommended to anyone interested in life sciences.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|My wife and I had seen this movie back when it first came out, and then forgot about it.  Then one day I was looking on Amazon for DVDs to purchase and found \\"The Straight Story\\" and remembered how I had enjoyed it before.  Through the wonders of Amazon Prime, it showed up on my porch a couple of days later.<br /><br />The story is a fairly simple one; an elderly man, Alvin Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth, learns that his brother in Wisconsin has fallen ill, and decides to visit him.  But he has a problem - due to his own health problems he no longer has a drivers license.  So he hooks a home built trailer onto his riding mower and sets off to visit his brother.  The movie is the story of his journey.<br /><br />There are several thing that I like about this movie.  First it is based on a true story, and is set in Iowa.  The entire movie is shot along the actual locations that the real Alvin Straight took.  The photography is beautiful, the locales are beautiful, and it tugs at the heartstrings of this boy of the middle of the USA.<br /><br />Second, there is no sex or violence.  I realized after watching the movie how conditioned I have come when watching modern movies to expect something violent or sexual to happen at some point.  Some one get killed, someone has an affair - you know what I mean.  In the back of my mind I kept expecting something to happen, but it never does.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a boring movie.  And Alvin has some close scrapes along the way, but it was so refreshing to not have the movie cheapened by inserting something violent or sexual into it.<br /><br />Third are the characters.  I have always liked Richard Farnsworth in the movies, and here he does a wonderful job.  Sissy Spacek, who plays his daughter, does a wonderful job as the woman with the speech impediment, taking care of her father while pining for the children she has lost.  The people he meets along the way are great also.  I don't know if they are professional actors, or extras from Iowa, but the do a great job of playing the small town, decent, salt of the earth people Alvin meets on his journey.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly, I like the message of the movie.  It is a story about reconciliation.  Reconciliation primarily between Alvin and his brother, who had a falling out a decade earlier over something that no longer matters.  But reconciliation is a continuing theme throughout the movie - Alvin reconciling himself to the reality of his failing health and steadily shortening life time.  Sissy Spacek reconciling herself with her dad's journey that she disapproves of and her loss of her children.  The reconciliation of the runaway pregnant teenager Alvin meets along the way with her family that she imagines hates her for becoming pregnant.  The reconciliation of the bickering twin brothers who repair his lawn tractor when it breaks down along the way.  And the reconciliation of Alvin and a fellow World War Two veteran he meets to the horror they experienced many years ago that still haunts their memories.<br /><br />This isn't a flashy action movie, no special effect, no frenetic action.  But it is a story that grownups (I won't use the term adults as that has a whole different connotation) will watch and enjoy.  Highly recommended!great job of playing the small town, decent, salt of the earth people Alvin meets on his journey.  Finally, and most importantly, I like the message of the movie.

1402736924|5.0|Learning gratitude and \\"seeing the silver lining in a situation\\" are prescriptions from both the Bible and worldly wisdom how to have a successful and joyful life. How would you like to have this important lesson clothed in a delightful story to warm your heart and inspire your actions this Thanksgiving season? The classic children's novel, Pollyanna, is the answer.  Yes, I know you've seen the movie. Most of us have had the pleasure of experiencing Disney's Haley Mill's 1960's version, but truly it is not the same story as you'll find in the original book. Hollywood created a musical, extravaganza Pollyanna; however, if you haven't read the book, you missed the full development of both characters and plot.  The Glad Game, the wonderful game Pollyanna's deceased father taught her, is a key theme throughout; it is beautifully developed and practiced in the book. To read its inspiration lay in the \\"rejoicing texts\\" was such a joy to discover!  This is just a fun suggestion to read and share Pollyanna by Eleanor Porter with the special children and the young-at-heart in your life to make your Thanksgiving and life even richer.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Even if you think you may not add that many apps over time, you will.  And this utility makes it INFINITELY easier to keep everything nice and organized rather than scrolling through a long list of apps.  I can now launch everything I need from one screen in a quick, easy-to-understand manner.  If you're coming from an iDevice think folders, but 100X more useful.  Honestly, Google should bundle this functionality directly into Android itself.  But more props (and money) to this great developer please.  It's updated regularly to boot.

0679722610|4.0|Red Harvest is acclaimed as one of Dashiell Hammett's best even though the work did not, like The Maltese Falcon, also become a movie classic. Brutal and cynical in conception, it pits a San Francisco detective against a corrupt Midwestern town nicknamed poisonville. The hero, after his client dies on the very evening of his arrival, becomes embroiled in a triangular fight between police, gangsters, and their common, industrialist paymaster. Shifting allegiances, gunfights, and repeated murders pepper the breathtaking contest that ensues. And the plot would not be complete without the involvement of the femme fatale Dinah Brand, the protagonist's beguiling but faithless information supplier.  Red Harvest is breathlessly-paced and highly readable. Still, I came to Hammett after having exhausted Raymond Chandler, and I did not find one quite on the same level as the other. This is a different kind of noir: rawer, punchier, less polished. The Continental Op, the anonymous hero, does not match the self-deprecating Philip Marlowe in complexity. Sultry L.A. has been lost in favour of a more rough-and-tumble setting. And the style of writing reflects this, stripped of Chandler's quirky yet apposite metaphors, of his ironic asides and wry character sketches. I will no-doubt be trying out more Hammett. As this did not match my extremely high expectations, however, I can only give it four stars.
B005HPA2XI|2.0|Let me just begin by saying I have been Listening to Mastodon since Lifesblood. Having said that, I am sad to say that The Hunter is really disappointing. I was not a big fan of Crack The Skye either as it veered too far towards Neurosis worship. The clean vocals just don't work for me (sorry but no one in this band really has the voice for clean singing) and as Dirty Harry once said, \\"a man's got to know his limitations\\". The first three albums and ep were filled with awesome, heavy, quirky yet catchy songs, the kind of songs that stick in your head long after the album is finished. The Hunter doesn't have one song that you could say that of. There is not one memorable track on this album and Creature Lives is the worst song they have ever recorded. I guess when I read Brent Hinds say he hated heavy metal and did not want to play heavy songs anymore I should have seen the writing on the wall. No I don't want Mastodon to keep writing the first three albums over and over. Just quit thinking so much and try writing some songs next time
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This CD should bring Johnny his much deserved grammy! I got this last night, can't get enough, it's number one in rotation!

I, for one, am thrilled that Johnny gifted us with this new release!
B004OFWLO0|1.0|It sounds like they don't believe the recent argument that the original recordings were sped up perhaps to at 81 rpm back in the day before the pressing. Record companies admitted to speeding up recordings back in the 30s. When I heard the album Steady Rollin' Man that slowed these songs to 78 rpm it was a revelation. A powerfull full throated man was singing. It was thrilling. Here, as on every release since 1937 his guitar and voice sound shrill, like a bluesy Alvin the chipmonk on meth on a toy guitar. He was a big man not a teenager or alien. It doesn't sound like a vocal style like Big Joe Williams. It sounds altered.  He may have used capos on the frets but to this extent is unlikely. I see Steady Rollin' Man is for sale used for a cent. Do yourself a favor and buy it. See where you stand on this controversy. There is a scientific way of checking the speed. Electricity used to record it will have made a background hum that would be the same hum the city generators made. Records of at what power they ran the generators in 1937 probably exist. This was done for the 64 year old Woody Guthrie recording now released as \\"Live Wire\\". The fascinating notes in that release explain this and other more complex scientific methods used to correct historic recordings now. I hear it costs a lot of $$$ to have it done.

B0058VW36U|4.0|I'm usually not one for playing games on my phone, but I thought I woud give it a try.  What can I say?  I got hooked!<br /><br />You probably already know that the object of the game is to \\"cut the rope\\" that's holding the piece of candy so you can feed the cute, little green monster.  You progress through levels that get harder and more creative in the ways that you have to earn points and feed the little guy.  The music that plays in the background reminds me of a movie or cartoon soundtrack.  It's cute and lively, but it's not over-the-top or obnoxious.<br /><br />If you are looking for a game to kill a little time and be pleasantly entertained, I'd recommend it.  Happy cutting!

0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins has blown me away yet again. She has an obvious talent for writing exhilarating romances with brilliant characters - I can't wait for more! Dolores Nolan aka Lola is a lover of fashion, letting her uniqueness shine through with her fun and quirky looks which change every day of the week. As a seventeen year old, she has a rocker boyfriend named Max. Thing is...he's twenty two and her gay dads aren't very pleased about it. They'd much rather she fall in love with Cricket Bell, her old best friend who broke her heart a few years ago when he used to live next door. Now that he and his famous twin sister have moved back...will the two rekindle their love for one another or will things prove to be just too difficult?  Like in Anna and the French Kiss, the main character of Lola and the Boy Next Door is trapped in a love triangle, however, the \\"other guy\\" isn't in another continent this time. Throughout the novel, Lola suffers from the guilt of having feelings for two boys. Deep down in her heart she knows that Cricket is special but how can she give up the boyfriend she already has and loves? Cricket Bell is awkward, intelligent and super cute. I love that he and Lola were best friends when they were kids! They were each other's first kisses (even though Lola mightn't have had his permission...), made adorable presents for each other and even annoyed his twin, Calliope, with their closeness. It's the kind of innocent and honest relationship we all love to read about. It was frustrating and even a little devastating to see almost everyone and everything getting in the way of their relationship. Boyfriends, friends, meddling sisters, parents...the evil forces of nature....will they ever be left alone? Every day and night they have an unspoken rule to see each other from their opposite facing windows. I lived for these sweet moments as we were able to see them naturally and without their real-life problems! The flashbacks are also to die for. They take usback to a time of happiness, although the anticipation of \\"the day that changed it all\\", otherwise known as \\"the day that Cricket Bell stuffed everything up\\", makes that sweetness very short-lived and valuable.   One of my favourite things about this novel was the presence of Anna and Etienne from the first. Lola and the Boy Next Door is the companion novel and to see our old favourites so often? Bliss! Their relationship is portrayed as being perfect and effortless, and upon seeing their absolute ease with each other, Lola is determined to find \\"The One\\". Despite how much I loved Cricket, Etienne St. Clair will always be my number one. He is my type of guy and the only thing stopping me from stealing him away is his height - did I mention that he's short...shorter than his girlfriend? *gasp* Cricket and Lola compliment each other perfectly though. Lola's the cool to Cricket's geek, the confident to his awkward, the crazy to his normal... The list goes on! At some point, Lola has a bit of an identity crisis. Max sees Lola (her normal self) and Lolita (her dressed-up self) as two different people, so which one is he in love with? Is Lola simply expressing herself or hiding who she really is? Luckily, Cricket steps in to reassure and aid our little princess, and I think you'll like the results. Lola and the Boy Next Door is essentially about change - in yourself and in the relationships which surround you.  If you enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss, this companion novel is sure to please. We were previously granted the story of finding true love for the first time, and now we get to see two people finding each other again after many years of separation! With this comes an intimacy that Perkins ALWAYS gifts us with and she is without a doubt one of the best YA romance writers out there. Impossible to be otherwise, the romance is heartwarming and will have you begging for Isla and the Happily Ever After. Will our two favourite couples appear in it also? We'll have to waitand see! ;)

B003YFIUW8|3.0|I liked the concept of the book, hence why I bought it. It did get a little bit exciting during the middle of the book, but it falls off about half way through. The fact that it was written from the kids perspective made it unique, but the story just falls flat fast.
B004ZNACA6|4.0|ok, It's great that the Floyd catalog has been digitally restored and remastered, to a great quality, but where are the extras, where is POINT ME AT THE SKY, EMBRYO, SEE EMILY PLAY, SEABIRDS,or any of those other rare songs form relics, or the early singles, or those cuts that us die hard Floyd fans long to get added remastered, ? I can understand if they cannot release the stuff from the ZABRISKIE POINT soundtrack if that is licenced to another distributor, but at least they sholud have released any cuts that have not seen the light of day except in bootleg forms, yes this set is great , but they could have given us more.( no I don't mean the third album MORE either.)
6305784116|5.0|The Aristocats is one hour and eight minutes and was release in theaters on December 11, 1970. This was Disney Studios 20th animated film and the last that was given approval by Walt Disney before his death in 1966. The film is set in 1910 Paris, France and centers on a mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens: Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse. Their owner Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is making out her will and her butler (Edgar) overhears the will and realizes that he is second in line to Madame fortunes with the cat and kittens being first. Edgar kidnaps the feline family and fails in his attempt to kill them, but does manage to loose the family. The family is found by a cat named Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley the Alley Cat. Thomas O'Malley agrees to help find their way back home. On the way back home O'Malley meets up with Scat Cat and his musical cat gang. All the cats sing to Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat. O'Malley brings home the family safely, but Edgar there is waiting to kidnap the cat and kittens and send them to Timbuktu. Roquefort, a mouse, alerts O'Malley about what is going on and O'Malley rushes back to save Duchess and the kittens and Scat Cat and his gang also come to help save the day as well.  This would be the last movie for two actors: Maurice Chevalier who was coax out of retirement to sing the opening theme song as well as poking fun at him at the end of the film. Look for the scene where Roquefort is chasing Scat Cat and his gang. The other actor final performance is Bill Thompson who played Uncle Waldo the English goose. Overall the Aristocats is a good movie to watch along with some funny scene to go with it. The Aristocats gets an AAAA++++.  DVD FEATURES  Chapter Selection  Set Up  Bonus Material  I.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|Everybody ought to read this book at some point in their lives. ITs such a part of our culture. Naturally the book has NEVER been represented by the movies, not even Kenneth Branagh's MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN, tho the 1931 classic hits the mood right on. Anyway, the book will overwhelm you when you read it. Once you get past the ornate language, and the \\"romantic\\" literary influence of the German gothic movement's fascination by suicides, ghosts,and various vampire-like themes, the story really is affecting. (Shelly, Lord Byron and Mary entertained themselves when they were hanging out around Lake Geneva by reading translations of German gothic horror stories.) One wonders how a 19 year old woman pulls this book out of her conscousness. Well, read Mary Shelly's biographical information sometime. Her mother died giving birth to her. Then, while she had started to write the novel, her half sister committed suicide. Right after that, Shelly's WIFE committed suicide--WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT--due to Mary running off with her husband. Plus while she was writing, Mary miscarried her first child. Mary had three children by Shelly altogether, but only one lived for any time, tho he also died as a child. Post partem depression severely affected Mary, after her first still born baby. (Her depressions over these deaths became so severe, she'd stop writting for periods of time.)Given the confusion of guilt and depression, Mary could have very easily felt responsible for the death of her mother because of her own birth, then the suicide of Percy's first wife and their unborn child, Mary's own first child's stillbirth, and finally her half sister's suicide. (Who knows if Mary's half sister left some kind of note blaming Mary for ruining her social standing in London, for running off with Shelly.) Whatever the circumstances, guilt plays a part in every tragic death. Surrounded by so much tragic death, and Mary's depression, guilt over at least SOME of these deaths certainly consumed Mary's mind. Its not at all hard to draw a line between the severe, maddening guilt of Victor Frankenstein, for the people his monster murdered, and guilt Mary felt over the deaths just mentioned. Perhaps even the destruction of the female monster, was Mary's desire to tear her own self to pieces and bury them at sea, to keep any more monsters (ie tragic deaths) from occuring.<br /><br />One thing that strikes you when you read the book, is how much GUILT OVER DEATH is much more of a theme, than the typical theme you usually encounter. (If man tries to play God, he suffers the consequences.) Maybe by refusing the Church's moral stance against adultery, Mary's \\"alter ego\\" felt she was playing God with what 1819 society viewed as God's commandments. Out of divine punishment, Mary could easily have felt her first baby died at birth, because Percy Shelly's unborn child died, when his wife committed suicide.(India's religious ideas were popular at the time as well, so karmic retribution may have been naggin at mary's conscience, adding fuel to the flames of compunction.) Some people see FEAR OF STILL BIRTH as the central theme of the story. Giving birth to something dead, is certainly what Victor did by creating his monster, as well as Mary when her baby was born dead. For me, this story's theme is more about a mother's GUILT that accompanies still birth, as well as GUILT felt when other people die, as a consequence of one's personal decisions. Given that her first child's death, Shelly's first wife and unborn child, and her half sister all died while Mary was writing this book, it would be nearly impossible NOT to see Victor's guilt as a mirror to Mary's own guilt.  IF this emotional realism were not present in the heart of the novel, it would not affect as many people the extent that it has, for hundreds of years.<br /><br />Mary's own destiny was just like the Victor/monster character. After Shelly died when Mary was 24, she never married again. SHe put herself into a cold, barren emotional wasteland, never marrying again or having more children. At the end of the story, Victor and the Monster end up in the frozen wastelands of the North Pole. (A symbol for Mary's own emotion distance from humanity.) By that time in the story, the Monster and Victor were emotionally indistinguishable. The monster claimed to feel as much sorrow, guilt and sadness, as well as emotional rage and anger, as Victor did over the various deaths of his family and friends. NO doubt Mary was feeling as guilt ridden, if not enraged at the vagaries of Fate, that the Monster and its creator felt as well. The monster reflects his creator Victor, and Mary reflects her creation, the Novel FRANKENSTEIN. And this mirror within a mirror works so well, because when it comes to tragic death, GUILT will always drive the survivors crazy. The REAL FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER is Mary's Guilt for the deaths she endured, and even caused by proxy, while writing the novel. SHe must have known this on some level, and therefore refused to give the monster a name. How can you put a name to such a hideous monster, that is essencially your own soul? (The PICTURE OF DORIAN GREY works the same way symbolically.)The power of guilt within all humanity, will cause this book to resonate for as long as there are people who will feel guilty over tragic deaths of those closest to them. That is the real fear of this monster...its not of defying God, its not fear of the dead, its fear of GUILT over the deaths of others.tional wasteland, never marrying again or having more children.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|Wilco has never put out a bad or even mediocre album, so saying this fits right in with the Wilco catalog, which it does, is high praise. Each album is great in its own way and I suppose what makes this one stand out is that here Wilco offers several great pop tunes, reminiscent of Summerteeth in some ways. \\"Born Alone,\\" \\"Dawned on Me,\\" \\"Whole Love,\\" and \\"I Might\\" are as poppy and melodic as anything Wilco has ever done. At the same time there are less radio-friendly but equally satisfying tunes like the sprawling, melancholy \\"One Sunday Morning\\" and the complex, Radiohead-like \\"Art of Almost\\" (I should add here that Nels Cline just shreds it on this song). \\"Open Mind,\\" \\"Black Moon,\\" and \\"Rising Red Lung\\" are gorgeous pieces of mellow, acoustic Wilco. I saw Wilco live on release day (in Raleigh) and it was clear that many of these songs will become concert staples. Jeff joked about this album going platinum (and about reading Amazon reviews). Wilco has never seemed to be fixated on commercial success, but they certainly deserve it. I could see this album going platinum though as more people discover that Wilco is an American treasure, truly the best band to hail from the U.S. This is a great album. Buy it. Maybe this will be Wilco's first platinum album!
0811729117|4.0|good book, realistic action .  It shows the fantastic performance of tanks and crews which were outnumbered beyond any reasonable hope.
B0058VW36U|5.0|An adorable little puzzle game that is challenging, cute, and fun at the same time. I picked this up when it was the free app of the day, but it's def worth paying for!
0525423281|5.0|Lola is lovely. Cricket is swoon worthy.  Gay dads, troubled mother and the Olympics all make appearances.   A really fun read that I couldn't put down.   I liked Anna better but this was great.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was, simply put, magical. With flowing prose, side show oddities, an unusual love story and those wonderful little vignettes where I, the reader, was waiting for and then walking through the circus, it was a complete experience.   The style was something unique and even though the story was slow building, it kept my attention and interest and I enjoyed the character of the actual circus and how we kept learning about it and its changes.  It's not rank with non-stop action, there isn't sex galore but it's whimsical and fantastical and immensely enjoyable. It won't be for everyone, but if you've looking for something different from the norm, if you're the kind of person who seeks out the unusual, the mystical, the unexplainable, if you want to be a believer, then this book is most definitely for you.
1451629184|5.0|This is one of those books you just can't put down and you keep wondering how did she stand her 'life' for so long? I guess we all have an inner strength that keeps on when we feel like giving up. It is a book that if you don't have emotion while reading it then you just aren't human.  I hope the parole officers lost their jobs for not checking the premises and as far as the two who kidnapped Jaycee  - instead of prison they should have been put in a boat with small holes and slowly sunk in the ocean and let the sharks have them for a meal. They are absolutely the lowest form of an excuse for human beings.  I am so glad that Jaycee has a loving family and those two wonderful little girls. Whatever the rest of life brings for Jaycee and her whole family I just hope it is filled with happiness and joy. Good luck Jaycee you are a very strong and wonderful person.
B003Y74AXO|3.0|This screen protector was harder than the name brands to put on properly -- way too many bubbles, way too hard to get them all out. Once on it seemed protect just fine, and the cleaning cloth is a nice touch. This item is not worth the money however, because of the problems with application.
B000002NJS|4.0|If you dig William Orbit and his techno inspired harmonics and sharp interplay you'll like this. Madonna does OK (\\"functional\\") in the real world of comparing her to top tier vocalists - but this is definitely the best production she ever had IMO. Orbit finds the best way to blend her seamlessly into the mix of layers he creates. As someone else noted, for a serious collector of music, this should be in your library.

B004LWZW24|5.0|Now here's a hard one to review without giving too much away, because this is just full of twists and turns.  I originally walked into this one knowing next to nothing other than that it was a haunted house story done as a collaboration between the makers of [[ASIN:B002VKE1K2 Paranormal Activity]] and the makers of [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]], which was more than enough to pique my interest, and I had consciously avoided seeing any previews other than the original teaser.  Having seen the full trailer a bit later on, I think they actually give a little too much away, despite its leaving lots still unhinted at, and despite the fact that apparantly some people first thought the trailer was actually too vague.  So I could just say I don't want to spoil it, it's awesome, it's scary, get it; but I assume people want more than that out of a write-up.  So here goes: upon moving into a new house, a normal, likable family of two parents and two young sons begin to experience strange and sometimes frightening events in their new home.  Familiar territory, but still highly effective if done right, as it is here.  And as the accidents and apparitions begin to increase, they do something I've never seen a family do in a haunted house movie: they move out BEFORE things reach a critical mass.  The reasons used in other movies to justify the family's staying even when everything is starying to go to hell in a handbasket - they've sank every last cent into the new house, a simple reluctance to accept the supernatural, the borderline-'possessive' nature of the haunting gets into the minds of one or more of the family members and makes them strongly and irrationally attached to the house in a way they don't even recognize - these can and have all come off good when done well (and sometimes come off badly instead, true), but it was very refreshing to see that simple and obvious step taken to defuse their supernatural problem (even though not all members of the family are convinced it's supernatural at that point).  So they leave.  Unfortunately, it turns out that doesn't make anything better - the hauntings and the incidens come right with them, and continue to intensify.  Leading up to the pronouncement seen in the trailer, \\"It's not the house that's haunted, it's the....\\"  With one of the family's children in deep trouble for a while now, the family turns in desperation to a psychic and her assistants for advice, not at all prepared for what they're going to hear.  I'm not going to get into too many more specifics, but it brings in more new and freakish elements as it goes along.  Some of the coolest and most shocking implications are buried in the subtext and in the viewers's own interpretations.  One particular possibility just floored me, and opened up the door to other potentials.  The visual imagery, the jarring use of innocent music against twisted macabre settings and happenings that makes the music and the smallest sounds seem so sinister, and the impressive use of eerily realistic special effects (even more impressive when you consider the movie's $1.5 million budget in an era when it seems to cost a mint to film a canned soup commercial) are all noteworthy.  So is the fact that the movie gets even better - and arguably scarier - on subsequent views, when you realize what's going on in all the seemingly mundane scenes, and the unique meanings of seemingly familiar incidents early in the show.  This is a winner all the way, and an absolute must for all horror fans.  Awesome and scary; get it.
B0054N73EY|1.0|it would be nice if amazon had a way of actually getting the product to you or at least refunding your money when your product never shows up.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|A group of Norwegian wildlife documentarians interviewing licensed bear hunters get wind of a poacher in the area only to discover that he's not hunting bears, that monsterous trolls are real and he's hunting them, in this excellent 'found-footage' monster movie from the ever-expanding film output of Norway.  Drawn into the troll hunter's hunt, to document the existance of trolls and the Norwegain government's decades-long efforts to cover it up, the hunters often become the hunted.  The trolls of the movie are of all different types and sizes, but all are near-mindless and immensely powerful.  If it wasn't for a couple of Achilles's heels that render them vulnerable to certain attacks, it'd probably take a small army to fell one of the larger or more aggressive ones; as it is they're extremely dangerous prey.  The policy of the Norwegain government has been to keep the trolls confined to large reserves far out in the uninhabited wild, and whenever one wanders off - wreaking property damage, eating livestock, occasionally eating people - it's the job of the troll hunter to track it down, terminate it, and cover up tracks of its existance.  What with the 'wandering trolls eat people' angle, the troll hunter doesn't come off as a bad guy, but he doesn't really come off a typical good guy either, and he doesn't view himself as a hero.  The haggard hunter is tired, jaded, and seems to view himself and his work in a less noble light than he may have years ago, before the endless hunting and killing of the great beasts began to take an emotional toll.  This mental fatigue is why he agrees to be documented - he wants this all to go public and be somebody else's problem; he's tired of his role in it.  The trolls, for their part, don't especially come off as bad guys either though.  They eat humans and farm animals along with their staple diet of rocks (their skin and flesh is in ways kind of rocky), but with no more malevolence than a cow would chew grass or a human would order a hamburger.  Some of them have a brutish, even oafish, charm, and despite an aspect of their hunting senses that hints at a possible demonic angle to the (otherwise non-supernatural) creatures, it's hard not to root for the big knobby guys.  Very well made with excellent special effects, an attractive mythos within the movie regarding the trolls and their history and lore, fine acting and characterization, and a setting in the isolated, vast, mountainous Norwegian north that makes it easier to believe in such large creatures dwelling undetected in scattered enclaves, all help make this one of the year's best movies.  Oh, and a wickedly cool end touch right before the closing credits.  A definate buy.
0006479898|5.0|Looking back, this is one of my favorite books in the series.  It marks beginning of Tyrion and Cersei's back and forth struggle for influence.  Tyrion is the star of this installment, in my opinion.  He develops more and more as a character and the reader starts to get a clear picture of where his head is.  He sees there are some underhanded things going on around him and he continually uses his cunning to set things right, or to what he believes is right.  He has to be a little underhanded himself to accomplish these things at times.  Arya's story also picks up tremendously.  We follow her travels and the perils she faces on her way to the Wall with Yoren (who is supposed to return her to Winterfell).  Characters such as Hot Pie, and Gendry are central to her story as well along with the introduction of one of my favorites, Jaqen H'Ghar.  Chance meetings with Amory Lorch and Gregor Clegane's forces make for an exciting read.  We see Robb's further rise to power through the eyes of Catelyn Stark.  She does her best to provide counsel, but the more Robb settles into his role as the king, the less he heeds it.  We also learn more of Renly and Stannis Baratheon's new quest for the throne.  We're introduced to Davos Seaworth who tells the story of Stannis Baratheon's bid for the throne through his eyes.  He is suspicious of Stannis' new found religion, worshiping R'hollor, The Lord of Light.  A red priestess, named Melisandre is introduced as a pivotal character in this story.    Possibly the most important development in this installment is the story of Theon Greyjoy.  He returns to Pyke and means to claim his rights as his heir to his father Balon.  We're also introduced (in a hilarious way) to Asha Greyjoy, Theon's sister.  Other new Greyjoy's emerge in his uncles Aeron \\"The Damphair\\" Grejoy and Victarion Greyjoy.  He isn't received as warmly as he would have liked and gradually, becomes more desperate to make a name for himself.  A wonderful depiction of what lustfor power and riches can do to a man's soul.    We also have Bran in Winterfell fulfulling his role as acting Lord of Winterfell.  With a little help from Rodrick Cassel and Maester Luwin, he entertains guests who will later play an important role in the saga such as Wyman Manderly, and Jojen and Meera Reed.  Bran faces some of the most heartbreaking challenges of anyone in the book.  Sansa's story continues as she struggles with the death of her father and living under the same roof and her betrothal to the boy that ordered Eddard's demise.  She endures much and remains wary of Cersei's ostensible comfort and grooming to become a queen.  Of course, the story of Jon on the wall continues as they venture beyond the wall in search of answers and hopefully, Benjen Stark's whereabouts or demise.  He travels with Qhorin Halfhand and faces a monumental decision that questions his very vows to The Night Watch.  Also Daenerys' story continues as she tries to move forward after the death of Khal Drogo and gather power behind her dragons.  We're introduced to Quaithe, Pyat Pree, and Xharo Xhoan Daxos, representatives of Quarth.  Each with their own counsel for Daenerys to gather more power along the way.  It's an amazing read just as the first and the three after it are.  This series will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, fantasy stories of all time.
0385534639|4.0|This is actually my first Amazon review.  I read the reviews of every book I am considering reading, but have never felt compelled to write one myself.  The Night Circus, however, has inspired me to share my thoughts.  This wonderful little novel is so enchanting and unusual that I cannot recommend it enough if you love strange tales of magic.  The writing in this novel has that rare voice that is both childlike in wonder and scope, but constructed with the depth and intelligence of an adult tale.  It opens with the appearance of a circus unlike any other, then proceeds show the paths that led to this moment in time and space.  It can be difficult to understand all of the motivations of the characters, and where the story is heading at times.  You feel like you are genuinely appearing as a voyeur on the strange lives this this story describes, with little in exposition; but the author uses such fantastic language that you willing allow yourself to be  taken blindly, and at times confusingly, on this journey.  In the end you are rewarded with a tale that you want to read again, immediately.
B002AS463W|5.0|My wife and I love this movie, but it does show a bit of control issues on the part of the main male character. Every time we watch this DVD we get to the point we want to make love. It is a very moving story.
B000M06K5C|4.0|Weekend in the city is the second album by British indie rock sensation Bloc Party. Solid album wth solid songs. Fans of the band will be fans of the album for sure. I gave it a 4 star simply because I prefer the first album more, as it has more bouncy and energetic songs as a whole. Fans of that style of Bloc Party will love \\"Hunting for Witches\\" though. All in all a great album with some slower more emotional tunes that are still really ass kicking.
B00003Q43A|5.0|We love this movie. It shows that the American spirit cannot be broken so easily. We are survivors, no matter what the cause. I believe this of our young men and women in our Armed Forces today. If we were to find aliens in our midst, I think that our government and our military can handle the situation with utmost promptness. And if you're wondering, Yes, I'm a Vet.
1609611543|5.0|This book took a lot of guts to write.  First of all, not only does it make sense, it is backed up by research and science.  What is more fascinating to me than what's actually in the book is the fallout there will be when the wheat industry realizes drooping sales of their product.  Our household alone is not spending thousands of dollars on wheat products per year, at least!  The bottom line is that wheat has never been meant for human consumption.  When people figured out how to make it edible, populations exploded and civilizations emerged.  That is a good thing, but it's based on a \\"food\\" that's not meant for humans to eat and the price for this is disease on a massive scale.  I also went through the \\"carb flu\\" when I eliminated all wheat from my diet and have to date lost almost 60 pounds, and never felt better in my life.

0525423281|5.0|There are two things that Lola wants at the beginning of the school year: to make the most spectacular Marie Antoinette costume ever, and to go to the winter formal in that costume with her boyfriend, Max. Unfortunately, things really aren't working out for her. It all starts when the Bell twins move back into their house next door to Lola. Lola, Calliope, and Cricket have a history, and Lola has gone to great lengths to avoid them, especially Cricket, after their last disastrous encounter. But despite that, Cricket seems to keep popping up in Lola's life, much to her boyfriend's annoyance. And Lola is discovering that it just might be possible that Cricket has changed. Maybe. But what does that mean for Lola and the life she's made for herself in his absence?     Stephanie Perkins, author of Anna and the French Kiss, has crafted another delightfully funny, quirky, and charming romantic comedy. Lola is a humorous, zany, and lovable heroine--her feelings where Cricket Bell is concerned are ones that all readers can probably relate to in some capacity, and the amazing costumes, social mishaps, and family drama just make her an achingly genuine character. There is no shortage of swoon-worthy guys in this book--there's the re-appearance to Etienne St. Clair, Lola's sexy (and older) boyfriend Max, and the introduction of sweet, brilliant Cricket Bell. All of the friendships and twisted relationships as Lola suddenly has to juggle Max and Cricket make for an engaging plot with a few unexpected twists. Though Lola and the Boy Next Door is not set in Paris like its companion novel, Perkins does an excellent job at bringing the rich San Francisco setting alive, from Lola's street full of row houses (guess whose bedroom windows are directly across from each other?) to the fun theater Lola works and the exotic tea gardens. The setting and the characters are what really stand out and make Perkins' second novel so much fun. This is romantic, hilarious, and smart chick lit that every girl who picks it up will be compelled to share.

Don't expect a literary classic or anything, but Sophie's writing style is fun and engaging.  I didn't want to put this book down and enjoyed getting to know Emma and her secrets.  Perfect for the beach or a relaxing day by the pool.

0385732554|5.0|I must admit, I found that once I started this book, it was incredibly hard for me to put it down. Lois Lowry is such a good writer.  The plot, I thought, was very interesting and unique. It's set in the future, in a world that is much different than what we know today. The memories that Jonas, the protagonist, must receive (as his job) are all things that we know of today. I found this interesting because it shares a view on what life could be like after many, many generations.  Not only did I enjoy the plot, I also enjoyed the book as a well-written piece of literature. Imagery and other literary devices were used very well in this book, which I loved.  I recommend this book if you're a fan of science fiction novels. It's an easy, fast read and I'm sure you'd enjoy it!
B004LWZVZC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It depicted the stress lawyers feel when faced with a client who is accused of doing something horrible.  Of course it really is timely as well since our judicial system is dealing with the prosecution of defendants accused of terrorism and similar tribunals are in place to judge them as were depicted in the movie.  I thought the acting was adequate, but the direction was wonderful.The movie arrived on time and was in good condition.[[ASIN:B004LWZVZC The Conspirator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]
B005DZMP00|4.0|This newly assembled collection of performances is acceptable and fun to hear, but not particularly outstanding. The original Europe 72 had a real special magic to it, not the least of which was due to the fact that many of the songs were new to us, performed with a memorable energy and precision. On the new release the worst part for my ears is the obviously out of tune guitars on the second CD. Eventually Garcia and Weir realized it themselves, and in the midst of a psychedelic jam where it became quiet enough for them to notice the sour notes, they began tuning up. I guess that was better than ignoring the problem, but it's painful to listen to. This was before the invention of stomp box electronic tuners available today, which allow musicians to mute their instruments and view a lit screen which displays their tuning status.  \\"Steppin' Out\\" in England, \\"Hundred Year Hall,\\" and \\"Rockin'the Rhein,\\" in Germany are all more consistently satisfying collections from the same 1972 tour than this one. Am I sorry I bought this CD set? Well, sorry I paid full price instead of buying it used at a steep discount.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is my favorite series since  \\"The Sopranos\\" and \\"House, M.D.\\" Fast-paced, but if you pay attention to details and follow the storyline, you can make sense of it pretty easily. The story of Walter White surely raises your awareness of just how prevailant and omnipresent meth is. You realize that the house or garage next door to you could be a meth lab. Please, whoever is reading this, DON'T DO METH!! It ISN'T WORTH IT!!!

B001NXDIMK|3.0|\\"Damages\\" is one of the most intelligent and twisty legal thrillers ever to grace television with first-rate performances by Glenn Close and Rose Byrne.  Terrific show, but where is the bluray version?  The first season looked aamazing in hi-def, so I'm not sure why the same treatment was not afforded.  Give us the blu...the show gets five stars...this sloppy presentation is a two star effort...
B002OSY2T6|5.0|We found out our daughter had torticollis when she was 2 months old (she has one neck muscle shorter than the other, which causes her to look in the same direction all the time).  We needed to do exercises and structured play with her at home, with a focus on getting her to actively turn her head from side to side.  At 2mos, she was not interested in many toys, and we had a lot of trouble.    I purchased this snail because of the loud sound and the lights.  It grabbed her interest right away and she follows it as we move it around.  The mirror is also good for tummy time, although our daughter has trouble picking up her head to look at herself in it because of her neck.    If you are struggling with torticollis I strongly recommend this toy.  Another good one is the Eric Caryle green frog because you can squeeze it and get a 'ribbit,' which has been a hit at our house.

B0058WFO06|5.0|Quite different than his last album, but wow!  My wife and I cranked it up and listened to it in it's entirety and were blown away yet again.  This isn't music to sing along to in the car, it must be experienced.  There is so much emotion put into this album.  I love the jazz progressive sound with Wilson's own mix of dark beauty.  If Wilson doesn't deserve some attention from this, I don't know what does.  Loved every song.  Again, you can't simply listen to sound clips on iTunes, you have to buy it and immerse yourself in the genius of Steven Wilson!

0676979343|5.0|I had no idea about Jhumpa Lahiri's latest release until I got many of those promotional mails from Barnes and Noble, Borders and Amazon offering an attractive discount. It was a perfect way to start the month. Obviously, my first intention was to check up at the local library, and on finding out that I was 81st in the queue, I quickly went to the nearest Borders store, swiped my Amazon (what an irony!) credit card for $15.75 (inclusive of tax), and there I was clutching the beautiful hardcover bound book as if I was the proud author.<br /><br />Even though Interpreter of Maladies was her first publication in the literary world, I latched onto this only after I had finished reading The Namesake. The Namesake has left a lasting impression in me (link). The feeling lingered on for some days, as the emotional aspect of the book ebbed on to me in seamless fashion. Her topics are not out of the world; on the contrary, they have got a lot to do with day to day situations that we conjure in our daily existence. It is this deft handling of simple situations that enable us to fit into the character's shoes, and get a first hand perspective of the way we tackle problems when faced with a similar scenario.<br /><br />In her latest offering Unaccustomed Earth, she plunges herself into the world of short stories once again, after beginning her career with a well timed Interpreter of Maladies, shifting onto a classic in The Namesake before bringing back a classic sequence of narrations, simple anecdotes with a beautiful touch of finesse and flair; an elegance that bowls me over when I read her books. It was this eager anticipation that propelled me to buy her latest book without a second thought. If The Namesake was about immigrants, there is no surprise to find similar entries stitching the pages in her new book. As she herself puts it across in various interviews (link), she likes to handle only issues that influence her to write, and there is no way that she is going to come out of these issues which impact so many people, and more importantly enable so many of her readers to identify themselves through the book. There is nothing wrong in sticking on with a single genre, if you can convey the message convincingly and in simple style. Let there be no doubts about it; she delivers these aspects in style. It is easy to place her style alongside RK Narayan.<br /><br />Unaccustomed Earth is all about emotions; the characters fit in neatly to the situation. Her words leave a big impact on you, and at times certain quotes set you thinking. She tours the world from Seattle to Italy, keeping the basic setting confined to the New England Boston area. Malden, Medford, Andover, Mass Avenue, MIT, Harvard, Cambridge Area, Commonwealth Avenue and the T stations; the unique perspective of Boston filled me with a tinge of excitement as I read on. The book has a collection of eight long stories, fitted in 352 pages, striking a rich emotional bond between different characters. She has explored every aspect of the relationship; her first story Unaccustomed Earth deals with the fragile bond between a father and a daughter. This to me is the story of the book as she beautifully brings to the forefront the unspoken relationship between the two protagonists leaving you with a tear jerking emotional ending. The Bengali connection presents a nice Indian touch to the elegantly composed sentences.<br /><br />Her take on life and happiness is very neatly worded as the daughter reflects on what her dad signs off with every letter,<br /><br />\\"Be happy, love Baba,\\" he signed them, as if the attainment of happiness were as simple as that.<br /><br />Similarly, her dad contemplates about the futility of migration to a foreign land leaving loved ones behind,<br /><br />And yet he knew that he, too, had turned his back on his parents, by settling in America. In the name of ambition and accomplishment, none of which mattered anymore, he had forsaken them.<br /><br />Her other stories deal with relationships; between a sister and brother, between family and friends, between a husband and a wife, between a brother and his little step-sisters. Her deft handling of these characters leave an enriching experience making it an entertaining read as you progress from one short story to another. Her last three stories fall under the sub-section Hema and Kaushik having a sense of convergence and divergence of these two characters.<br /><br />It is this repertoire; a collection of meaningful and strikingly worldly events in life that leaves the reader with an uneasy contemplation. It is as though you want to be involved in it, and at the same time detached from the vagaries of it. Jhumpa Lahiri carefully treads on the fine line striking a delicate balance between the certainties and uncertainties leaving the readers with a sense of attachment and detachment through her brilliantly created characters. So, in order to enjoy the finer nuances of this beautiful book, the best thing would be to grab a copy from the nearest book store or the library and get mesmerized in an intricate web of emotions and relationship.

B000GQOTBO|5.0|The book driven mainly by a single character, Howard Roarke, an architect who is the symbol of ideals, values, morals and principles leaves us in doubt. Who gets the credit? Howard Roarke or Ayn Rand, the author? Ayn has created Roarke to perfection and his ability to stick to his strong ideals in the face of adversity leaves the readers with a sense of deference towards Roarke. The main theme of the book is whether an individual has to live for himself or should he survive by appeasing the whims and fancies of all around. The latter is referred to as the Second Hander. According to the author, the creativity of the owner is modified by the second hander to get adoration and admiration that would prove to be futile in the long run.<br /><br />The Fountainhead is a simple story of the life of two different kind of architects - Peter Keating(second hander) and Howard Roarke(creative idealist). Roarke is suspended from Stanton institute in his final year of his architectural study as he refuses to believe in the confined system of education that provides nothing to enhance his ability. On the contrary, Keating sticks to his education which lands him in a top architect firm in New York city. The initial struggle of Roarke reduces him to penury and the roaring success of Keating(thanks to Roarke's help in various architectural drawings) makes him the top architect of the country. There is a stage in Roarke's life, where he has not paid his office rent for two months, telephone bills, electricity bills for the same duration and the remainder of his life cringes on a bank contract that he eagerly awaits. In spite of his hard-stricken financial position, Roarke has the guts to refuse the contract since the committe members suggest modifications in his drawing. This tells us the kind of stance taken by Roarke in the worst of circumstances. He undertakes all kinds of work to keep his life moving, even going to the extent of working in a quarry. At a later stage, he meets the woman of his life - Dominique Francon. They share a passionate relationship and Dominique's mind-duels with Roarke forms a very interesting and fascinating sequence. Howard Roarke's association with Gail Wynand, the owner of the prestigious newspaper The Banner, who also happens to be Dominique's husband, steps up Roward in the success ladder. Whether Roarke is successful to stick to his ideals and live out his life in peace forms the essence of this brilliantly crafted book.<br /><br />This is a book that really gives the reader to ponder whether he is on the right path of fulfilling his dreams. Fountainhead springs forth the virtues of solitude - the ability to think alone. The highly philosophical drama embedded with strong messages is a must read for people who look forward for a book without any tinge of commercial elements - thriller, mystery or romance.is life - Dominique Francon.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I am still loving this album and months long after it was released. deluxe version has a few extra songs that should be singles too! great album all around. Britney always delivers!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|If this version had the Zen garden I would have given it 5 stars. I hope they come out with an update soon.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|One of the main reasons I had my PS2 modded was so I could play the European version of ICO. I beat the game which opens up the possibility upon replay for a second player to join in. The second player's role as the girl is pretty limited though. This time through is substantially more familiar (a negative) but the graphics and the bonus content are rewarding. What a vision Mr. Ueda the creator has for creating these single player experiences. When both of these games were released there was more info embedded in the code than the PS2 could handle--thus the remastering is largely a liberation of existing detail originally existent. It is not (however) like playing them for the first time. It is a re-experience of how they were meant to be played in totality.     I gave this collection 4 stars for fun. I had already beaten ICO once and SoC twice on the PS2. Therefore the \\"fun\\" rating. There are only a handful of PS2 games that are worthy of this kind of remastering. These are two of them. I would not mind seeing the Norrath series remastered since I believe there is more detail to be revealed and several existing bugs that need repair. Perhaps Dark Alliance I  could be a good candidate as well. I would be interested in hearing what others might say about games they would like to see remastered for the PS3.
0525951652|2.0|I was soo looking forward to this book!! I absolutely LOVED Pillars of the Earth &still to this day think it is one of the absolute top 10 books .. BUT this on, Fall of giants was not up to par!! The main characters were not engaging, I didn't feel involved w/ any of them i.e. really didn't care what happened to them, there were just some outright stupid parts, like when Walter finally,  after 2 years sees his wife Maud & is kissing her face all over & holding her tight & she asks if he still loves her!??? WTF!! Is Follett GAY?? Does he not know how women react?  IS Maud so retarded she can't pick up on her hubby practically molesting her in public & has to ask!?? I kept hoping while reading this monster of a book that it would get better~~ but it DIDN'T,  it was like finding a pint of Ben & Jerry's in the back of the freezer, only to find there just 2 bites left!  I WILL not be reading the other 2 in this series, in fact I'll go re-read Pillars~~ This one was so crappy it makes me wonder if Follett really wrote Pillars after this clap-trap!
B004H7QICG|5.0|I was initially very impressed with the build quality of the case, and as I went on installing all of my components it became more and more clear how much attention to detail they've put into this case. Cable routing is made very easy, so doing a very clean looking install is quite easy. The removable hard drive bays make installing/replacing hard drives very easy, and the adjustable aperture separating the lower and upper halves of the case makes routing cables through there very easy and clean looking. That being said, considering the emphasis on quietness this case has gotten in other reviews, it wasn't quite as quiet as I expected. It's still very quiet but when the CPU fan ramps up you can definitely hear it. I'm willing to accept that perhaps I was expecting too much. The design is understated but still very bold, certainly stands out compared to many of the cheesy cases being offered these days with all the lights and clear acrylic windows. All in all I am very happy with this case and I feel it was certainly worth the money.

0307477479|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that kept me up past my bedtime two nights in a row! The older I get, the more nostalgic I become and the more aware I am of life while I'm living it. Egan captured all of that in a stunning novel that shifts seamlessly from past to future to present and back to past again. Her characters have depth and, with the pace Egan moves, I felt like she was chasing them in time and space and recording what she saw. I think every person who reads this will connect their own fuzzy memories to the stories, the passage of time (the \\"goon squad\\") and circumstances that make us who we are on the surface with multiple versions of the younger self hidden (or not so hidden) underneath.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the \\"future\\" sections - they reminded me (in a way) of Gary Shteyngart's \\"Super Sad True Love Story.\\" The chapter in Powerpoint was a fascinating perspective by a teenage girl at some strange point in the future. This would be a book worth a second or third read; I think one would find something new each time.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is an extremely fun game. The play is smooth and it adds many different gameplay mechanics as you level up.
B001DCN178|5.0|I needed a controller with a very specific set of requirements. Those included:   * Pitch bend and Mod Wheel controllers  * many continuous MIDI controllers (sliders, knobs, wheels, etc.)  * input jack for expression pedal (another continuous controller)  * input jack for sustain pedal  * all controls quickly and easily assignable with minimal programming  * USB connection AND MIDI connection for more options  * USB powered to reduce cable mess  * very small keyboard with assignable functions  * easily programmed presets  * small footprint and low height  * reasonable price  This list eliminates pretty much all the competition. I was left with the UMA25S, and there really weren't a lot of other choices, as in none at this price and this size. The problem for me was that it was made by Behringer. If you've been around for a while, you may remenber when Behringer was not regarded highly by many professional musicians. But I took a chance, having no other real options, and I'm happy to report that this little controller turned out to be amazing! Behringer has been making major strides in quality; I just didn't know it.   The operation is easy. To program a knob for any continuous controller is fast work with MIDI-Learn. That is, if you can click on a Breath Control event in your DAW and send it to the UMA25S, it can learn it, making for quick set-up. Click Edit, then touch the knob you want to program. Then hit the LEARN key, send the data to the device, and hit \\"STORE.\\"  All done.  If you must program the number without MIDI-Learn, the procedure is only a little more involved, but still fast. Save knobs into presets so they will be quickly recalled without having to program them each time. Presets are just as easy to set up, and you can have 16 presets.   The keyboard is a little different with \\"half-action.\\" That means it barely moves when you push a key. I thought that would make it hard to express with a full range of control, but I was wrong. It's all there, and you get used to it very quickly.   The UMA25S comes with a shoulder-strap. I thought that was a cheesy addition, and mocked it until I tried it. Ok, I have to admit, once again I was wrong. The shoulder-strap is a darned good idea. I actually LIKE it. No need to act like a rock-star; it's just convenient, and the small footprint gets even smaller when you hang it up on a hook when you're done.  Set-up on a Mac consists of plugging in the USB cable and turning on the device. Immediately, Apple's Audio/MIDI Setup recognizes the device and gives you access to it in your applications. You can customize the driver in Audio/MIDI Setup, but there's not much to do; it's pretty much automatic. I can't speak for Windows, but I would assume it's not difficult.   With virtual instruments demanding more and more continuous controllers for expression, vibrato, timbre, pitch, and so forth, this device is a VERY useful addition to any MIDI studio. Setup and programming are easy. Performance feels very natural, and it's easy to control two or three knobs at once, sliding your fingers along their perimeters and developing gestures that work them in consort, as for expression, vibrato speed, and vibrato depth, which work best when altered together. Program them side-by-side and you can actually work them together with some practice.   Note, for beginners: this is a controller. It produces no sounds of its own. A device like this requires that you understand MIDI commands: they generally include a channel, an ID, and a value, at the minimum. When used with a Digital Audio Workstation such as Digital Performer, Logic, or Pro Tools, the channel is not an essential part of the output unless you are multi-recording (the DAW patches it through to its proper destination via individual MIDI tracks). It can default to channel 1, making setup of continuous controllers even faster.   This is perfect for controlling virtual instruments. While it only has a two octave range, a very conspicuous button allows you to change octaves instantly, making most everything playable except for continuous multi-octave runs or arpeggios. Those can be edited to play back as if they were continuous. I have a Kurzweil 2600 88-key MIDI controller/synth/sampler for the big stuff. I needed something fast and agile for quick recording and editing. This does not replace the Kurzweil, it enhances my studio with a very powerful, quick, device that can be stowed out of the way and retrieved when you need it. Just remember to turn it on before you boot your DAW, and leave it on until you quit.   Excellent device! I could not be more pleased.   Shooshie
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I should start by saying that I am a newcomer to the Fire and Ice Series. I started reading after enjoying the HBO series and was immediately hooked. I picked up the Kindle set of the first 4 books and read them all in quick succession. As soon as I finished I logged on to buy A Dance With Dragons and was surprised to see it had such a low overall rating and a glut of negative reviews from long-time fans of the books. Many reviews made it sound like the book was awful and a complete departure from the previous amazing works. Worrying I was was going to be disappointed and regret spending the $$ I planned to just get it from the library in the future. But I am glad I decided to judge for myself.<br /><br />PRAISE: I wish we could rate books by the half star. I couldn't give it 3 stars because it was more than just OK to me. But I am not sure Like It describes how I feel about this book either. What I can say is that I think this book's tone, pacing, and plot makes sense if you think of it as the middle of an epic telling of Martin's world instead of as an individual book. This book isn't as compelling as the first 3 in the series and doesn't have OMG moments like Ned's beheading or the Red Wedding. However I don't think it needs to have those to be successful book. We learn some new things we didn't know before and we see a different side of a few familiar characters. The story doesn't progress much and nothing much gets resolved, but I think that was intentional -- and not just to string the books out and make more money. I think Martin took a risk with DwD and achieved something very few authors do. His prose left his readers in the same place emotionally that his characters were throughout the book -- lost at sea, frustrated, unfulfilled, and feeling like what they long for is just within reach yet so far beyond their grasp. Somewhat manipulative and cruel = yes. But I don't think it was a result of poor storytelling. I think it was intentional to some degree andeffective.<br /><br />CRITICISM: A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons should have been one book (as I believe was originally intended). The books could have been edited extensively and tightened so that Martin's achieved the same overall effect without making his readers feel strung along and manipulated by having to slog through two books where not much of the story progresses. And that is what I think the majority of the very low ratings are due to. If I had been made to wait multiple years for the publication of DwD I don't think I could look at it in a very positive light. A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are the typical middle of a series books where pieces start to fall into place and not a great deal happens. Lots of series I have read have books like these and they always get lower ratings than the beginning and ending books. But where Martin erred big time was in taking so long to write this book and allowing excitement and anticipation to build yearly when he knew what this book was. That sort of build up would be great for the denouement but only breeds resentment when the book was always designed as just a sort of staging for what is to come.<br /><br />So I am giving Martin the benefit of the doubt because his first 3 books were so brilliant and the latter 2 were much better than anything else I have read recently even with their flaws. I think he would be wise to get Book 6 out within two years and to make sure it is fast-paced and ties up some of this one's overused loose ends. I will definitely read to the conclusion of the series no matter what and no matter when it comes. I think Book 6 will be the make it or break it one for me though. I would much prefer to read what is to come with anticipation and excitement and not out of a sense of duty to see the story to its conclusion. Guess we will have to wait and see.

B005NNVPOO|5.0|Album as a whole will always get 5+.  The remaster is quite great.  The band has always complained about the sonic quality of the album.  The only true way to fix this would be to go back and re-record it.  Aside from that, you can remaster with the best technology available.  That's what seems to have been done here.  Now I don't believe they did what they did for the 5.1 release of dark side where they went back to each individual track and went through the hassle of putting it all together again, but you can certainly notice a difference.  I've listened to this album in and out over the years with high quality head phones.  The remaster brings a little something more to the picture (which is the purpose of course).  Good job for a great album

Um die Bewohner die Konsequenzen eines Aufruhrs niemals vergessen zu lassen, muss allj&auml;hrlich jeder Distrikt einen Jungen und ein M&auml;dchen im Alter zwischen zw&ouml;lf und achtzehn Jahren, also zwei Tribute, zu den '\\"Hungerspielen\\"' ins Kapitol schicken, wo sie gezwungen werden sich auf Leben und Tod zu bek&auml;mpfen, bis nur noch einer &uuml;brig ist.<br />Jedes Jahr schwebt dieses Damoklesschwert &uuml;ber den Kindern der 12 Distrikte, doch das ist noch nicht einmal das Schlimmste: W&auml;hrend die B&uuml;rger des Kapitols in Luxus schwelgen, hungern die Bewohner in den Bezirken, und kommen gerade so &uuml;ber die Runden. So auch die Familie der sechzehnj&auml;hrigen Katniss aus Distrikt 12. Ohne ihre illegalen Jagdausfl&uuml;ge, w&auml;ren Katniss' Mutter und Schwester schon vor Jahren verhungert.<br />Als am Tag der Auslosung der Name ihrer zw&ouml;lfj&auml;hrigen Schwester gezogen wird, meldet Katniss sich freiwillig als Tribut. Dass das Los des m&auml;nnlichen Tributs auf Peeta f&auml;llt, ist f&uuml;r sie ein Schock, denn der B&auml;ckerjunge hat ihr vor Jahren einmal das Leben gerettet, und nun soll sie ausgerechnet ihn in der Arena umbringen.<br />Nachdem die 24 Tribute im Kapitol aufeinandertreffen, beginnt ein spannendes Katz- und Mausspiel, denn nun m&uuml;ssen sie um Sponsoren buhlen und heimlich Zweckb&uuml;ndnisse mit den st&auml;rksten Mitstreitern schlie&szlig;en, damit sie den Kampf in der Arena m&ouml;glichst lange &uuml;berleben.<br /><br />Als ich das Buch von Pfingstsonntag auf Montag gelesen habe, bin ich nach der letzten Seite v&ouml;llig paralysiert in die Schuhe gesprungen, hab mich ins Auto gesetzt, das wie von allein zum Bahnhofsbuchladen gefahren ist, um mir den 2. Teil, Die Tribute von Panem. Gef&auml;hrliche Liebe, zu besorgen. Dort war es jedoch vergriffen. Also wieder ins Auto und ab zum Buchladen im K&ouml;lner Flughafen, der es ebenfalls nicht (mehr) hatte. So blieb mir nichts anderes &uuml;brig, als fingern&auml;gelkauend bis Dienstag auszuharren, um schlie&szlig;lich doch noch an den 2. Band zu kommen.<br />Ich glaube das sagt mehr &uuml;ber das Buch aus, als jede Rezension.<br /><br />Dieser Roman hat mich komplett umgehauen. Die Geschichte, die wundervoll-komplexen Charaktere, sowie der einzigartige Schreibstil der Autorin, sind mir derart unter die Haut gegangen, dass ich nicht in der Lage war, das Buch vor der letzten Seite aus der Hand zu legen. Als Leserin tauche ich in das Leben der sechzehnj&auml;hrigen Katniss ein, werde eins mit ihr und sehe die Welt mit ihren Augen. Dabei treibt mich die einfache und dennoch so einf&uuml;hlsame Sprache der Autorin immer weiter, bis ich nicht mehr aufh&ouml;ren kann zu lesen.<br />Meiner Ansicht nach braucht dieses Buch eine eigene Kategorie, denn allein der Inhalt, die Idee der Story bekommt von mir 10 Sterne. Und obwohl es nur einen Handlungsstrang gibt, ist das Buch wahnsinnig vielschichtig und bis zur allerletzten Seite unglaublich spannend.<br />Die zwei Helden, Katniss und Peeta, muss man als Leser einfach gernhaben. Beide sind vielschichtige Pers&ouml;nlichkeiten mit einem gutm&uuml;tigen Charakter, die ohne es zu Wissen im Verlauf der Geschichte das Kapitol bek&auml;mpfen und landesweit die Zweifel am System verst&auml;rken. Inspiriert von ihrem Beispiel, sch&ouml;pfen die Bewohner von Panem neuen Mut, denn wenn zwei Tribute aus Distrikt 12, dem Bezirk mit den wenigsten Privilegien, Tapferkeit beweisen, warum nicht auch seine B&uuml;rger? So entsteht eine ganz neue Dynamik innerhalb der Geschichte, deren &uuml;berraschenden Wendungen den Spannungsbogen bis zum Schluss fast unertr&auml;glich hoch halten.<br />Am Ende war ich fix und fertig und wollte nur noch eins: Den 2. Teil.<br /><br />Fazit:<br />Volle Punktzahl f&uuml;r einen Roman, der mich komplett aus den Schuhen gehauen hat.aus den Schuhen gehauen hat.
B0058VW36U|5.0|takes a long long time to load the game and app hangs upon starting first level. barely usable unfortunately. perhaps a samsung issue? game is fine for other android users and fun on ios. sorry for bad review. wish there was a way to not give it low star rating because of some incompatibility? Update: i waited a long time for the first level to finally load... And it now works smoothly... Closed and reopened app five times or so and by sixth time it finally loads quickly. Raising rating to 5 stars since it finally corrected itself. Definitely some sort of problem with certain configurations or manufacturers given some of the reports here

B0000029PC|5.0|I'm going to make this a review of all the major recordings of the Schumann Symphonies, up to the moment of October, 2011, with an overall recommendation of the winner. This is after many years of listening to and thinking about many versions of these evergreen masterpieces of charm and Romantic imagination.     First, one of the best is certainly this one, by George Szell and his great Cleveland Orchestra, originally recorded for Epic in the late 50s and early 60s. My main impression of these performances is of the color which Szell gets from his orchestra. Many critics have complained about Schumann's orchestrations, based on their ignorance of the size of the orchestra of the 1840s-1850s. It was about 50, not 90-strong, so much of the \\"grey\\" sound they complained about was based on the practice of playing anything written before 1870-1890 as if it had been written in 1890. They played Beethoven as if it was Bruckner, and did the same for Schumann, for the most part. Szell avoids that, even though (I believe) he doesn't reduce the size of the ensemble, but judiciously adjusts balances and prunes some of Schumann's own mistakes in orchestration, most of which seem to have come from his late period when he was a very bad conductor in Dusseldorf, and seems to have become more conservative, perhaps due to concern about his future reputation, and edited his works, changing who knows what youthful great inspriration for more mature mediocracy. The later version of the D Minor Symphony is a perfect example. Brahms preferred the earlier, much more lighly orchestrated and perhaps more radical version, while Clara forbade its publication, in favor of Robert's later, more conservative version, still great if played with care for balances. Szell plays all these lovable works with great care but with ample warmth and brilliance. I particularly like the playing of the \\"Spring\\" and D Minor Symphonies, while the Second was a Szell specialty which was frequently taken on tour. I also love the performance of the \\"Manfred\\" Overture, much better than any other I know, including Bernstein's with its almost shocking retardando for the coda. But, more on Lenny in his place. Of course, Szell avoids repeats, as always, but it doesn't matter here as much as it might in a performance of a more Classical work, such as a Mozart symphony, which Szell always excelled in and in which I always regret any cuts.      Next, let's look at the Sawallisch set on EMI with the Dresden orchestra. I don't know the newer recording he made with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2003, but it got good reviews in such respected organs of opinion such as the New York TIMES.  In his older recording, I hear much that is similar to Szell's way of playing these works, but Sawallisch takes all repeats, all to the good. Also, the sound is better; actually, it's really only marginally so, since EMI has never been known as a recording company on the level of say Decca or DG in the matter of sound. But, the playing of the Dresdeners is wonderful, certainly on the level of the Clevelanders. The filler is the Overture, Scherzo and Finale, which gets an excellent performance of a work that should be better known, since it tells us clearly that Schumann was a man of the 1830s-1850s, who knew Mendelsshon and was a contemporary of Berlioz and Chopin, not of Bruckner. But, more of that later. Also recommended.      Filling out the \\"older\\" versions are both of the Bernstein sets, the first from the late 50s-early 60s, the same time as the Szell recordings, the second from the 80s. I used to really like Lenny's way with this music, and I still do, to an extent. Ultimately, though, I cannot really recommend either of his sets over those of anyone else here due to inferior sound in the earlier recordings, made for Columbia, with the NY Phil. in which the playing is crude and almost harsh, and the sound is boomy and over-resonant and much too loud, and the newer set,in which there's the continuedtendency Lenny had to indulge in too-slow tempos for slow movements. Often, this can be interesting or even compelling, but inevitably, it's just not totally convincing. For example, in the 60s set, the slow mvt. of the C Major Symphony is about the slowest around (in stereo, anyway), and it certainly impresses with its passionate intensity, but it's really just too slow, and both Szell and Gardiner, among others, are more convincing due to more control and balance. In the 80's set with the Wienner Phil., the much better playing and sound are offset by such excentricities as Lenny's way with the slow mvt. of the \\"Rhenish.\\" Typical of Bernstein's extreme nature or of his nature of extremes, this is much too slow, but it does gain in soleminity at times and clarity of sound, especially in the cadential chords, which are very beautiful, but it also loses any logic and momentum it might have had. It's a bit like some of Henry James's sentences in his late novels. You might get lost.  It's an interesting experiment or maybe an example of late Lenny and his self-willed tendency to attempt to find what no one else had found. I really think alot of this tendency might be based on his own failings as a composer, but it was always there. In brief, Schumann wasn't Bruckner, so why play his slow movements as if he were? Sorry. I can't recommend.      In recent years, we really have had a renaissance in Schumann performances, probably because of the 200th year anniversary and because of the continued progress in the \\"period\\" instrument movement, begun in the early 60s, and now headed by such great conductors as John Eliot Gardiner, whose set of the complete Schumann Symphonies includes both versions of the D Minor Symphony as well as a fine recording of the G Minor fragment. There are other excellent contenders in the Schumann symphony market out there now, such as those recordings by Zinman and by Paavo Jarvi (out in November, 2011), the first using some \\"period\\" instruments and the second with vibrato-less modern strings and modern ensemble, but I must give the final prize to the Gardiner set, probably due to Gardiner's superior conducting and the excellent playing of his splendid \\"period\\" orchestra, given great sound by DG. The only drawback, perhaps a minor one, is the lack of the \\"Manfred\\" Overture, one of Schumann's finest orchertral pieces, but you can get that on the Szell set, so my final advice is to get the Gardiner set, by all means, but also get the Szell for the use of \\"standard\\" modern instruments and the inclusion of the wonderfully played overture. That way, you get the best of both worlds, and hear Schumann in ways which he would probably indorse.     All of these performances, except for the earlier Bernstein on Sony, are available for viewing/listening on Youtube. Listen and decide.  In addition, see the interesting publication called \\"A Comparison of Robert Schumann's Fourth Symphony with its Reorchestration by Gustav Mahler\\" by Howard Pitt Hsu, D.M.A., (Proquest UMI).

B0057XSCJG|4.0|Alright, not going to lie. The only reason why I gave this review 4 stars is because the Disney version Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite all time disney movie, and possible favorite movie of all time. I absolutely LOVE that movie. When I heard that a modern version of Beauty and the Beast was going to come out (Obviously \\"Beastly\\") I was absolutely ecstatic that I made sure I saw this movie on the day it came out. I never heard of the book until the title of the movie. So I read the book (after i watched the movie in theaters).  When watching the movie, it was a cute story...but I could feel something was missing out of the whole movie. It felt so anti-climatic that it just wasn't right. I read the book, and like numerous of times...the book had plenty of parts that wasn't added in the movie. Yes, I understand it's a movie and some parts are going to be cut out and others are going to be added randomly...but the parts that was cut out were kind of major. Without those parts, it made the movie feel really bland. The casting was good (Especially Alex Pettyfer..hehe) and the guy who played the blind tutor (don't remember his real name...or even his acting name really...I don't remember it being  mention very often)...sheesh...I think the blind tutor was honestly what made the movie enjoyable. He had some pretty funny lines in there.  But watching the movie, you can tell that they left something out. The general plot is how Kyle is going to learn how see beyond looks and beauty and that it's what inside that counts (how cheesy does that sound? lol it's true though). But there was something else missing along with it.  This movie is probably worth watching once...maybe twice...but it's not exactly something to go and blow your money on for the blu-ray or dvd. Seeing it in theaters was good enough. Renting it should suffice if anything.
