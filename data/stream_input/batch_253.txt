B000002UJQ|5.0|It may seem strange but i never really been interested to Radiohead when they released OK Computer.  Neither when Kid A was released. I bought Amnesiac just because I had some money to spend and i said to myself :\\"Oh, it's not too expensive, it's new, the cover is great, I'll buy it.\\" I didn't know at that time i was to fall in love with this band's music. Amnesiac was so good that i had to run and go buy Kid A. I still can't stop it from playing and NOW at last, I listen to OK Computer and I realise how this album is wonderful.  I think everyone here reading this review should buy the 3 CDs right now !  Don't wait ! Don't loose your time like i did !!! BUY THEM NOW !!!  ;)
B000069HKH|5.0|IT'S like entering the land of rock n roll, and hearing beautiful vocies coming from the place of worship.<br />You walk into the temple, and it's like a western/southern scene from the days of yore. Bruce is the pastor, who delivers sermons only in hymns, because in the land of rock n roll, it's all about music. The E-Street band is the choir. In rock n roll land God, through his sermons, does not judge, condemn or disapprove. He just understands. So Bruce sings His Word, about people's pains when they lose someone to something they just don't understand.<br />What defines The Rising as simply, unbelievably, great, however, is the way Bruce is able to make it sound like something out of Born to Run,  Born in the USA and all his past great, signature albums, but still, something so modern, with elements of New Age in it.<br />The Rising is the quintessential rock n roll album, simply put. It encompasses elements of all types of music;  African-American southern gospel, du wop, folk, industrial, new age, and really, the classic rock n roll sound that is Bruce Springteen.<br />At times, during The Rising (track), I felt myself swaying and clapping, as if I were in one of the pews. At times, I was just still, listening to only the haunting sounds of a sad, sad song, like I felt during those lonesome days in my grunge years, to gentle rifts in the background, so beautiful, I wanted to cry.<br />At times, I was rocking to the great sounds fo classic seventies and eighties rock. Then, I was contemplative, of the beautiful stories told in simple songs, that is the essence of folk. But what impressed me most (because truly, the aforementioned is essential Bruce) was the times I was taken back to my Muslim heritage, when I heard the sounds of the Middle East come through rock guitar rifts and lyrics that told me I would not be condemned for the religion of my parents and forefathers.<br /> To understand how it is possible for something beautiful and holy to come out of a tragedy so great and unable to contemplate that was September 11, listen to The Rising. Because it is proof that there is a God, and He is good, and He has plans for the world even when we are at our worst, through the beauty of  Bruce and his E-Street band.gedy so great and unable to contemplate that was September 11, listen to The Rising.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This has got to be one of the most tripped out films that I have ever seen. I was greatly disturbed by this film. YOU NEVER KNOW what is going to happen next. It is totally unpredictible. This film was truly made before its time. It totally creeped me out, and the grainy black and white color of the film is totally effective, as are the music and sound effects. It simply feels like a nightmare. The mutated baby in this film is horrifying, and the \\"Lady in the Radiator\\" scenes are, too. <br />See this movie and see what I mean. It will haunt your dreams.<br />In heaven, everything is fine....
B000002L6P|5.0|There I was, a shy, geeky spendthrifty 14-year-old.  Then along came Madonna and Like a Virgin.  Suddenly, I was a total Madonna addict, listening to this album religiously every day, buying every silly teen mag that even mentioned her, and--to the horror of my parents--covering all of my walls with Madonna posters.  No other album has ever had such a influence on me.  I was still shy and geeky, of course, but I was a changed person.  Over the years, my Madonna worship waned but never disappeared.  Going back and listening to this CD now, I am amazed at how great it sounds, and I enjoy the memories it stirs inside of me.<br />No one can deny how huge this album was.  It made Madonna a superstar, and it sunk its anchors into both the album and single bestseller charts.  The title track was of course a huge hit and represents to me a cultural phenomenon.  Material Girl had an even larger impact, and many would argue the song basically defined the decade of the 80s; it certainly helped shape the decade.  Dress You Up was just a fun song with a great beat; as things turned out, it was to a certain extent prophetic because Madonna basically did dress up great multitudes of young admirers copying the Madonna look.  Angel was another big hit, largely because it was so easy to relate to.  Anyone who has ever had a crush on someone knows exactly what Madonna is singing about here.  Over and Over also charted, I believe; it lacks the substance of the other songs on the album, but both the words and the energizing music do encourage you to keep going in the face of setbacks.  Love Don't Live Here Anymore is the true gem on here, though.  I kept expecting it to be released as a single because I really believed it would be a huge hit.  Some parts of the album are a little sugary, but this song proved that Madonna did have substance and a talented voice.  She packed real emotion and power into her lyrics, and I have always found the song to be well nigh heartbreaking.  As for the remaining songs, Shoo-Be-Doo and Pretender are somewhat formulaic and lack pizzazz, but Stay is a song I have always liked quite a bit.  It has an emotional quality that I find compelling; I could do without the &quot;scoop scoop&quot; choruses, but overall I find it a song of significant merit.<br />Not everyone will associate this album with a personal paradigm shift of great personal importance (which is how I view it), but when you get down to brass tacks, the album has more than its fair share of great songs which remain fun and vibrant all these years later.  These songs still energize and inspire me, and Love Don't Live Here Anymore still captivates me.  For those who discovered Madonna in the 90s or more recently, these songs may sound simplistic or perhaps immature, but I believe that the eternal spirit, magic, and unparalleled success of Madonna can be traced back to its very source in Like A Virgin.remaining songs, Shoo-Be-Doo and Pretender are somewhat formulaic and lack pizzazz, but Stay is a song I have always liked quite a bit.

0805062971|5.0|This book is shocking and provocative, but also has enough meaning behind it to be considered great.  This book faces issue that most books don't.  It also pushes boundaries that might throw mild readers off and disconcert them enough to not read the book.  But if you can handle radical ideas and life altering reading then this book is a must have.  It follows a man through a very odd time in his life and his friend Tyler Durden, the man who changes his life for better or worse, Tyler changes everything he knows about the world and gives him a new way to look at it.
0780626966|4.0|The &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series was, in my opinion, the only one that justified the number of sequels it had. It is also the most entertaining, original, and frightening of all the 80's &quot;slasher&quot; films. They may be a campy as a row of tents, but they are still among my favorite guilty pleasures.<br />The first three movies are without a doubt the best, with part 4 being okay, and part 5 being awful. &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; capped off the series nicely, while &quot;New Nightmare&quot; found a brilliant way of making another movie as a self-parody, rather than a cookie-cutting of the older movies. Many don't consider it to be part of the series, but it defintely is in my opinion. I will always pick Freddy over Jason or Michael Myers for his devious sense of humor. Who can forget the classic line &quot;You've got the body, and I've &lt;peeling back scalp&gt; got the brains&quot;. Great line.<br />Collectors can enjoy a whopping 8 DVDs of Nightmare material, including all 7 films and a bonus DVD filled with behind-the-scenes  extras, interviews, and other goodies. I enjoyed the book, but the extra DVD is a real bonus. It made the DVD set more enticing, considering the price tag.<br />Unlike the Friday the 13th or Halloween movies, which specialized in cookie-cutter sequels and little to no variation, the Nightmare series is the one that is worth owning on DVD. The originality, the chills, and the fun make the series stand out from all the other campy 80's horror series. I can join the rest of the horror movie fans in saying &quot;They don't make em like this anymore&quot;.

Through his journey from the shy freshman to someone who has changed and made new frirends. This is a book you can read over and over again, and find something that you didnt know before. I highly recommend this book, it's amazing! I've read it at least 50+ times and each time I find something that I never knew.
0375703861|5.0|On the strength of Zadie Smith's short story in Nick Hornby's great anthology, &quot;Speaking With the Angel&quot;, I picked up Smith's virtuoso first novel &quot;White Teeth&quot;. &quot;White Teeth&quot; deals with the interconnected lives of a group of vastly diverse individuals forming a dysfunctional extended family. The hapless Archie and self-important Samad are just two of the amazingly nuanced portrayals Smith creates in her novel. In the style of Paul Thomas Anderson's film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Smith's &quot;White Teeth&quot; is a big, ambitious work in which strangely unrelated lives crash together with sometimes hazardous, unbelievable results. The plot is not nearly so important as the fantastic characterizations. Smith effortlessly juggles a great amount of action with grace, emotion, and indelible humor. She touches on everything from war, politics, fundamentalist religiousity, multi-ethnic society, to unplanned pregnancy. This novel has something for every reader and is more fun than it promises in its early pages. Forgive the intimidating length and spend some time with this novel--- it's more than worth it.
1556154844|4.0|This book sat in my office shelf for years until, after my last job, I sat down and read it from cover to cover.<br />I wish I had done so much earlier.<br />I won't repeat all the accolades from downstairs except to point out the following:<br />* The single most valuable thing about this book for me is his comprehensive synthesis of probably the entire history of SE thought up to this date.  He not only quotes Brooks and Weinberg, but research data from study after study to back up every point he makes.  He is consistently fair and candid, giving each different school of thought its due.  Very often he presents not just the accepted p.o.v. but other, contrasting ones to give a full pro & cons picture of a given practice - most notable in his treatment of \\"gotos\\" (and we all thought it's a dead topic).  Extensive yet unobtrusive cross-references point out relations between topics.  And at the end, a full chapter of book recommendations and lists of other professional resources.  The bibliography alone runs to 18 pages.  This is the work of a generous man - not a man with an agenda, but a man that sincerely wants to help his fellow practitioners improve their trade.<br />* However, despite his textbook-like approach, this is not a boring book.  His clear style and constant revelation of ideas keep things moving (I never thought a chapter about naming variables can be exciting :-)).  Long on practical, down-to-earth ideas and short on jargons, this book is written for YOU and not your boss (or worse - his/her boss).  The elegant, almost-better-than-O'Reilly layout of the book helps a great deal.<br />* Particular nuggets include the discussions on table-driven data design, data and routine naming, PDL for designing a single routine (and how it ties into the rest of the lifecycle), and a good example on 2 different ways of code sharing that now would fit into Martin Fowler's Refactoring book.<br />* ... Which brings me to what this book needs - UPDATE!  Many of the issues raised in the book are addressed in the last 10 years (Java, design patterns, refactoring, Extreme Programming, new software metrics like function points, CMM, IDEs and CASE tools).  New topics have also popped up (Open Source, the internet and modern distributed network apps)  In particular, I'd like to see him dissect the whole OO legacy, now that it has matured.  I'd also like to know how much of the research results still stand, now that large software systems seem so _qualitatively_ different.<br />* Lastly, there's one thing I still can't figure out - if Microsoft is using so much of his (impeccable) \\"best practices\\", why are their products still so worthless? :-)<br />All in all - an unhesitated BUY.  For an up-to-the-minute supplement, you might try Joel on Software (joelonsoftware.com).<br />(My Fave Quote from the book: \\"If you work for 10 years, do you get 10 years of experience or do you get 1 year of experience 10 times?\\" - give THAT a thought!)
B000002ADT|5.0|Undoubtedly, Miles Davis is the master of jazz. This album is rightfully one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time. Every song is great (there are only six), but my personal faves are &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;So What,&quot; a couple up-beat, fast-paced joints and &quot;Flamenco Sketches,&quot; a slower one. It's always quiet - Nothing loud and sudden - and very relaxing. Unless you'd feel a subconscious urge to lay your head down on a pillow and fall asleep, this would be great for taking a road trip or chilling out with some friends. You'll be bobbing your head and swaying it at times. It's great. &quot;A Kind of Blue&quot; is definitely a must-have album for ANY jazz fan and of course, for EVERY Miles fan. Check it out..
B000067JHW|2.0|\\"Amelie\\" is cute and refreshingly different, but not that good. A few cinematic tricks (which we see every week on \\"Ally McBeal\\" and a sqeaky clean girl do not add up to a great movie. First, the character development is not strong at all ... We see reactions of people, but nothing more. As for the script, well, directors let Chuck Norris say more than this star. For the first half hour, I thought she was mute! And the story line? I could see this train wreck coming at the beginning. How sweet! Cute lonely girl helps others find happiness. Will she find love and happiness herself? Duh! ...! If you want to see a great film about how one person affects others, one that has great writing, acting, character development that is far above this \\"Amelie\\" tripe, then rent or buy \\"Vagabond,\\" a film by Agnes Varda starring Sandrine Bonnaire. I guarantee you, put these two chicks in the same room and the Vag girl will stomp all the cuteness outa that imp in two seconds! And don't worry, \\"Vagabond\\" has subtitles too! Hurray! Grow up! \\"Amelie\\" is for those who still believe in the tooth fairy. \\"Vagabond\\" is for those of you who figure that, if there is a tooth fairy...
B0000508U6|5.0|Those are the words that stick out the most for me on this album.  I heard &quot;Yellow&quot; and fell in love with the raw beauty of it on the radio. It was one of my favorite songs, but I just wasn't too sure about purchasing the album.  Then, my grandmother died, and I remember hearing about the news while &quot;Trouble&quot; was playing.  I don't know why, but that song just reminds me of her, even if the lyrics don't relate to the situation. I could not get the song out of my head. I bought the cd two days later.<BR>There aren't too many cd's where I can say that I love all of the songs, but this album is one of those rare ones. This is the kind of cd to listen to after having a bad day, or just something if you want to chill out.<BR>What I love about it is the optimism with the lyrics and the sheer beauty of the music itself.  &quot;Don't Panic,&quot; and &quot;We Never Change&quot; are my two favorites right now, but that list is constantly changing.<BR>Plus, another thing I love is Chris Martin's voice.  There is an honest yearning in the songs and his voice that is simply beautiful.  With all of the negative and dark music out there, it's refreshing to have a band like Coldplay tell us that everything is going to be alright.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Laundry Service is a fantastic album but rather hard to describe in a review. I bought this album at 11:41:07 on Saturday 16th March 2002. (No I'm not sad, I just says so on the reciept!) By 13:06:43 (the time I wrote the Amazon.co.uk review of Laundry Service) it was one of my favourite albums ever!!!<br />Laundry Service begins with Objection (Tango) (10/10). This is one of the best tracks on the album in my opinion. The rap is great and the accordians after the chorus are so cool! This is to be the third single to be taken from Laundry Service. It souunds like the female version of Ricky Martin's massive US and UK 1999 No.1, Livin' La Vida Loca - but much, much better! Track 2 is Underneath Your Clothes (10/10).This was the second single to be taken from Laundry Sertvice after Whenever Wherever in the UK and peaked at No.3 in July 2002. I wasn't too sure about this when I first listened to it. But it's really grown on me and I love it. The lyrics such as \\"you're a song, written by the hands of God\\" and \\"underneath your clothes, there's an endless story, there's the man I chose, there's my territory\\" are beautiful and well-written. The video was directed by Herb Ritts (I think) who has directed videos such as Madonna's Cherish and Britney Spears' Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. Whenever Wherever (10/10) is Track 3 - the first single from Laundry Service. One word; stunning. The lyrics and the beats are totally addictive. Pipped to the UK No.1 spot by the dull Will Young, winner of Pop Idol UK. The video is absolutely eye-poppoing - definetly the most impressive music video since Britney's Baby One More Time. Whenever Wherever is the biggest selling single of 2002 on the World Chart. Released in February 2002, it was No.1 on the European Chart for months and is STILL in the Top 3 - now almost September! Track 4 is Rules (9/10). Another great pop/rock track. The lyrics such as \\"use your eyes, only to look at me\\" and \\"use your mouth, only to kiss my lips\\" are really simple so you'll be singing along to this funkadelic, catchy gem in no time! Track 5 is The One (10/10). Shakira's funny and weird lyrics are proven on this song; \\"So I find a reason to shave my legs\\" and, \\"So I learn to cook and finally lose my kitchen phobia!\\" If this was to be released as a single, it would become an instant classic. It just has that anthemic feel to it that everyone at a Shakira concert would love and sway to. Ready For The Good Times (10/10) is Track 6. Another great pop track. Instantly makes you want to get up and dance - but the lyrics \\"I'm ready for the good times\\", I fell, are repeated a bit too often. Despite that little mishap, this is pure Euro Pop at its best. Track 7 is Fool (10/10). Definetly one of the best tracks on the album. The choruses are very worldy and the verses have great, but funny, lyrics. A possible future single? Watch this space!<br />Te Dejo Madrid (10/10) is Track 8. The whole song is in Spanish so I don't really know what she's on about! It sounds a lot like a Gloria Estefan track and has a very good chorus and verses. The first part of the chorus sounds like \\"this is the rhythm of my life\\" from a song I can't remember. Track 9 is Poem To A Horse (10/10). Another mid-tempo rock track. The lyrics are very strange, but funny: \\"I'd rather eat my soup with a folk or drive a Cab in New York\\". What else can I say? This is yet another brilliant song! Shakira must have worked her (big, and very nice!) [rear] off recording this album! Track 10 is Que Me Quedes Tu (10/10). Another mid-tempo ballad sung entirely in Spanish. I don't quite understand her, but the song is good with a good chorus. This is a brilliant song to just chill to. At almost 5 minutes, it's the longest track on the album and stays slow and relaxing all the way through. Don't stay relaxed for too long though...because you'll be up on your feet the SECOND track 11, Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi) (10/10), starts! Oh my GOD!!! This is my favourite track on theentire album!!! It is simply stunning!!! The whole song has a catchy, sassy chorus. It's so fast and energetic. It's written by the Latino dance diva Gloria Estefan. The beginning sounds like something really medievil and gothic. I like the bit when the men sing with the deep voices! The chorus is one of the best I have ever heard!!! This has GOT to be released as a single. Please, Shakira if you're reading this review (which I doubt very much), you have to release this song. I can just imagine a massive, multi-million dollar video that features in a huge blockbuster movie such as The Mummy 3 or Tomb Raider 2! Track 12 is Suerte (Whenever Wherever) (10/10). The Spanish version of the worldwide smash-hit Whenever Wherever. Again, I don't understand the lyrics 'cos they're all in Spanish but it's great. You'll know where the choruses and verses start - so you can sing along in English. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango) (10/10) is Track 13. The Spanish version of Objection (Tango). It's not as good as the English version, but is still good. I wondered why she kept on singing \\"Mona Lisa\\" but remembered that that's what \\"mother\\" is in Spanish!<br />Laundry Service is a stunning album that everyone should own. The albums beginning is amazing and never lets down as the songs swing by. There's no way you can not like this album - you just have to buy it. I know I'm being a little over-enthusiastic, but I can't help...it if I'm just a fool! (Stop singing Fool!) Shakira will become one of the biggest stars in the world up there with Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson with the release of this masterpiece! Buy it now!!!! I say now!

B00000JY1X|4.0|I was recently reminded that I used to listen to The Magnetic Fields by a friend, and popped over to Amazon to pick up \\"69 Love Songs,\\" from which I had previously heard just a few tracks.  Stephin Merritt is in high form here, with his collection of love songs originally written with a revue-style show in mind.  Although quality sometimes suffers in the name of quantity, there are many strong tracks on this compilation, full of trademark musical experimentation, haunting bass crooning and beautiful female vocals as well.  Merritt writes about love and loss with both clarity and humor, ranging from the sweet and longing \\"Come Back From San Francisco\\" to the Bridget Jones-ish \\"Reno Dakota\\" lamenting the playboy who never calls back.  Fans of the Fields will be thrilled to have so much material, recorded and written, in this box set; those new to the band will no doubt find plenty from which to make their own compilation tape or CD for more frequent consumption.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Over the years, Robert Altman has proved as elusive as his films to classify or to try to get the definitive pulse from. His films are at once quite focused and yet all over the place. The predominating feature of each of the films is that it is an attempt to define and describe a kind of insane little aspect of the world, as in \\"MASH\\", \\"The Player\\", or  \\"Nashville\\".  He seems intrigued by the way in which earnestness and sophistry pass through the lens of every observer, so that while we believe we are viewing something in all due reference, he is poking fun at our attempt. Yet he is still standing there next to us, peering through that same small knothole and straining to try to understand whatever it is that is going inside that small space we can see beyond the wooden wall.<br />For Altman, life is messy and hard to discern, and a lot of the dialogue in his films suffer from the same level of noise and discord. Yet no one seems as uniquely capable at capturing all of the noisome nuances of human interaction in its full range of pathos and progress than does Altman. As in MASH, his depiction of the nature of life in an English \\"cottage\\" is a masterpiece of such imaginings. The cast here is superb, including Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Kristin Scott Thomas as the rulers of this limited universe, as well as others such as Kelly MacDonald, Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, and Clive Owen as the working class stiffs just trying to scheme their way through the day.<br />Altman pokes great fun at both sides of the socioeconomic divide, and it is the nature of the class-ordained behavior that provides the foundation for this look at life in the English countryside. While it has commonly been observed before that a hard a difficult life has its rewards, especially allowing for a more realistic appreciation of the gifts of life, never has it been done so gracefully, imaginatively, and with such roaring good humor and repartee as here.  Certainly, Altman's fondness for noise and chaos furthers this search for the truth in the situation as nothing else could. The film is entertaining, worthwhile, and extremely well done. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!e and chaos furthers this search for the truth in the situation as nothing else could. The film is entertaining, worthwhile, and extremely well done.

0783226063|4.0|As a viewer, I have a major character defect.  I am a sucker for splendor and the kind of heroic melodrama that brings a tear to some eyes and a wince to others.  Usually I can keep a tight rein on this insidious bad habit, but Dino de Laurentiis definitely knows how to push my buttons.  So, while others gnash their teeth about everything that is not quite right about this version of 'Dune,' I just sit there eating popcorn and being awestruck.<br />Well, there really is a lot wrong.  Despite similarities to the book, it's hard to decide whether the film invents more than it leaves out, or vice versa.  After a relatively orderly beginning, the film suddenly switches into helter skelter mode, shifting from scene to scene with very little continuity.  If you have read the book, it isn't too bad, but if you have not, it is quite confusing.  It's like a Reader's Digest abridgement of a 600 page book.<br />The film does manage to get the idea across that this is the story of galactic politics between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, with the Emperor (Jose Ferrer) on the side of the Harkonnens and no one on the side of Leto Atreides (Jurgen Prochnow) and his son Paul (Kyle Maclachlan).  But it barely touches on the machinations of the Bene Gesserit, Navigator's Guild, and Mentat castes.  And we see very little of the rich Fremen culture that lives on the planet Arrakis, where the life giving Spice is mined.<br />What the film does extremely well though is provide one eye filling spectacle after another.  'Dune' is a big book, and De Laurentiis and David Lynch have manages to capture its immense sense of scale.  The sets and photography are lush with imagery, and the worms that haunt Arrakis' desert (and have by far the largest acting part) are great special effects.  Of course, all the players are visually perfect, and many are very competent actors.<br />I have become convinced that the De Laurentiis formula avoids putting pressure on acting skills.  Unlike 'Conan,' where only the villains had decent speaking parts, 'Dune' allows Paul Atreides to actually speak in whole sentences.  However, Kyle Maclachlan is much better at looking good and making strange noises than he is at speaking naturally.  But you have to like Patrick Steward as Gurney Halleck and Kenneth Macmillan's maniacal Baron Harkonnen.<br />It is unfortunate that this film turn out to be irritating to many fans of the book and equally for newcomers to approach.  Deep down inside it is likeable in the same fashion as a good comic book.  For some reason it continues to tickle my fancy after all of these years.ere only the villains had decent speaking parts, 'Dune' allows Paul Atreides to actually speak in whole sentences.

B00005JKED|3.0|This movie is exhibit one supporting the old adage that actors often win a belated Oscar deserved for earlier work in a movie that scarcely qualifies for such an honor. While there is no mistaking the excellent performance of either Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke in this tale of a cop gone bad after spending too much time on the street, the mind reels to consider Washington performed as well as did Tom Wilkinson in \\"In The Bedroom\\" or Russell Crowe in \\"A Beautiful Mind'. This movie is just not that much of a showcase for Denzel's considerable talents.<br />To begin with, the plot is hardly plausible, and it is downright silly to believe such patent nonsense as is presented here as the events transpiring in a single day.  Shades of James Bond! Whatever happened to the idea of presenting something believable? If we are talking \\"B\\" movie entertainment, fine. But if we are going to consider giving an actor an Oscar for an outstanding performance, it might be nice to have him deliver that role in something less than pop fantasy. Shades of old Rooster Cogburn in \\"True Grit\\"! As a fantasy escape vehicle, this gritty cop drama works well, but as a serious drama, it has holes big enough for Shallow Hal's girlfriend to waddle through.<br />All that said, it is an entertaining and action packed film. Indeed, this is a film overdosing on adrenaline, a movie with nothing but ups and precious few downers, except, of course, for the morality play at the end that serves, of course, to provide the filmgoer with a sense of closure and wrap the enigma of this bad cop up with a bow.  Yet a lot of bad guys get away with it, and this character certainly seems street-wise enough to have maneuvered his way out of the dilemma.  I enjoyed watching it, but felt the performances were not what I would expect from an Oscar-caliber effort at moviemaking. Enjoy!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Sure, she may have caught your eye with her pink hair and fresh lyrics, but this CD offers something even more.  Missundaztood is Pink's clear departure from typical music today.  As she stated in an interview, she's really laying herself out on a line here.  It's dangerous, but sometimes that's what it takes to succeed.  Well, Pink, lucky for you - it worked!!!  <br />Pink comes clean on tracks like \\"Missundaztood\\" (self-explicable) and the heart-wrenching \\"Family Portrait\\", about kids stuck in the middle of a divorce.  This is Pink's real life story - when she wrote the song she played it to each of her parents and broke their hearts *sigh*.  Other highlights are the determined \\"18 Wheeler\\", the sassy \\"Respect\\", and the rockin' number \\"Numb\\".  By singling these ones out I am by no means putting down the rest of the CD - notice I haven't even included tracks 3, 4, and 5, which are all singles.  <br />This multi-faceted album starts out fast and mellows out to allow Pink's honesty some leeway, and the CD ends just as great as it started.  It's clear-cut and rockin' smooth, with a little less edge than her debut \\"Can't Take Me Home\\".  That's not a bad thing, just notes the direction in which her style is leaning as she matures.  Her image has also changed a little - but while her name no longer applies to her hair (pink, white, purple, black - whatever) it doesn't seem to matter anymore, Pink is all about the music.  Just buy this CD and you'll see what I mean, then maybe you'll understand her.  Great CD for Pink fans, or curious converts-in-the-making.  For lack of a better word - THIS CD ROCKS!!!
B000068TPN|5.0|I would first like to respond to the reviewer who pointed out that the American soldier was less than gallant --often. He is correct --the Vietnamese (and I also know people who fought on that side) were also less than gallant  I am glad the Vietnamese won the war and have always had that position from the days of the anti-war movement--that being said--it is beside the point. There is nothing wrong--in fact it is fitting and proper to celebrate the courage of the American soldiers--something we in the anti-war movement so often disdained. This film shows that courage while treating the Vietnamese with astonishing sympathy.<BR>It is those in the Anti-War movie whose \\"cheap grace\\" and arrogance has bled into the present culture that need to see this movie. <BR>Again I believe the Vietnamese cause was  just but the curroption, narcissism and sanctimony  of the anti-War movement was also less than gallant. Someone should make a movie about that.
0684800713|2.0|It's sad really.  This was my first and only Hemmingway book and, while I know that he's a great writer, I honestly didn't enjoy the read.  The overall story was soothing and romantic, but it was like a steak layered in fat.  You have to cut through the lard to get to the good stuff.  Its plagued with names of random clubs and restaurants, I'm guessing an average of 5 names per page, which end up amounting to nothing.  Usually when I'm reading a book and a proper noun is mentioned, I make the special subconscious effort to keep it in memory for later use, but EH spews them out with no regard.  His characters also tend to go off on the dumbest little rants, in which a theme or subject re-occurs until you want to throw the book across the room.  At one point Bill goes on a rant about stuffed animals, then Mike goes on about how Brett is &quot;A fine piece.&quot;  Maybe this is Hemingway's attempt at humor, or maybe its ridiculous, or maybe its just over my head and I'm ridiculous.  It's hard for me to fathom a time when everyone seems to be rich.  Everyone is always eating at classy restaurants, traveling, and talking like they were born with silver spoons in their mouths.  How are these people paying for all of this?  Jake was a writer, and I don't think most writers these days are traveling to Vienna and Spain and Paris for fun on the weekend, and I'd put money down that most of them cook rather than eat out most of the time.  Its just really hard to swallow.
B00005S6K8|4.0|I know, I know, the late great Audrey Hepburn is supposed to be the quintessential Sabrina, but I have to confess, even though I like Humphrey Bogart I couldn't see him as Linus. And I love Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford together. I also like the newer movie's depiction of Sabrina's life in Paris. Even if you're a die hard fan of the old Sabrina, give this one a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised.
B00005JKJA|5.0|wow. that was the one word that came to mind after watching Lynch's Mulholland Drive for the first time. That, and, \\"my head hurts.\\" After watching it a few more times, I feel that I am qualified to write a review concerning it.<br />It was originally a TV pilot (the first episode of a TV show), but when the show didn't get picked up, it was turned into a movie. The fact that it was a pilot is evident, there are many storylines happening at once, some don't get resolved all the way, some don't really get resolved at all. The biggest complaint that most people have about this movie is that it doesn't make sense. But i say, why should it have to? The movie is complusively watchable, headed by the beautiful Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, and filled to the brim with memorable scenes that range from outright hilarious (the botched murder that was supposed to be staged as a suicide) to the breathtaking (the night at Club Silencios). It is this latter that truly blew me away. As the host utters, \\"it is all an illusion\\" we know that he is not only speaking about the events occuring onstage, but also about the movie itself. But that he could come out and say that what you are watching is fake, and (for myself at least) then that we can totally forget it, only to be reminded of it again in a matter of moments is astonishing. That scene is one of the greatest scenes in any movie I have watched in a long time, perhaps ever.<br />And it is the last half hour, after the box has been opened, that really calls for repeat viewings. As one other review put it, it feels like all the pieces are there, all the clues are in front of you, and all you have to do is put them together to figure it out. Personally, i haven't quite gotten it all figured out yet; I doubt anyone besides Lynch will ever really know everything there is to know about the story. But man alive, its refreshing to find a movie that doesn't spell everything out for you, it's great to see a departure from normal Hollywood fare. I will take this anyday over any blockbuster that can be spat out in a matter of minutes. This was my first foray into Lynch's world, and you can bet that I will be returning. Oh, and to give kudos where it is due, the score to the film was OUTSTANDING, and provided great tension and suspense; one stand out is an early scene that takes place in broad daylight in a parking lot. to anyone who is looking for something of a different flavor, and is willing to open their mind to a different type of movie: WATCH THIS. you will not be disappointed.<br />Very Highly Recommendedare.

B0000542D2|5.0|...<BR>One of the things that's interesting about this movie is that it seems so unscripted, almost improvisational, yet except for a few lines of John Lennon's all the dialoge was written out and rehearsed. I think that shows how amazingly talented as actors the Fab Four were.<BR>This movie is a treasure and number one on my list of favorite films.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|The film is a stew of stylistic cliches, unimaginatively employed melodramatic devices (ex: the heroine must sacrifice her virtue for the hero - to an enormous grinning black man, no less - this situation is both racist and tired), and just plain nastiness.  Under the guise of realist high drama, the film wallows in the abject in a way that is at once pompous and sophmoric.
B000065U1N|5.0|A very intense movie regarding urban warfare, America is heroic<BR>when dealing with an enemy of unforseen tactics.<BR>All I can say is &quot;God Bless America&quot; , democracy and men of<BR>honour-meaning the American military from private to general<BR>and the men,women,children and political parties who support<BR>them in a democratic way.
B00005JKNC|2.0|Frank Darabont is the man behind the most under-rated film in Hollywood history. This, of course, is the best movie nobody has ever heard of: 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It is, by far, better than 'The Green Mile', an equally compelling film, and when I heard that his new film, 'The Majestic', was on its way, I was, needless to say, excited. <br />Unfortunately I got myself all worked up over nothing. 'The Majestic' was full of so many plot holes that I was surprised Darabont wanted anything to do with this picture. For instance, the town is such a tight-knit community that &quot;Luke&quot; would have been easily recognized. And if not immediately, the doctor would have caught on at first glance. He was, of course, engaged to the man's daughter. <br />But overlooking the major lapses in this film--most people won't catch on, except for us bona-fide movie fanatics--I couldn't attach myself to any of these characters. Jim Carrey, in my opinion, should stick to comedy. I almost felt bad for the man, because he seemed to want to burst out of that shell he was forced to live in and begin insulting everyone around him...in a comedic sort of way, that is.<br />All in all, 'The Majestic' is more sugar coated than a sugar cookie. And at its two and a half running time--that's right, and this is a PG movie--it takes literally eighty minutes before I grew interest. That, however, tapered off after the re-opening of the theatre. <br />There were no real likeable characters, and the acting seemed overdone and too soap-operaish for me. Even the climatic ending was annoying, because Carrey was continualy interupted, and with all the commotion around him, you could barely discern his words from anyone else's.<br />Do me a favor: if you want to check something out by Darabont, go BUY 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Chances are you've already seen or read 'The Green Mile', but the previous of the two is his real masterpiece, and nowadays, it's almost the same price to rent the film thanit is to buy it...and you will be buying it.<br />Sadly, I was disappointed with 'The Majestic'...it just lacked the magic I expected.
0823003035|5.0|This is a high quality book and you will notice that the more you read it. It contains very good drawings, it won´t knock your socks off, but it will capture your attention.<br />It is about drawing from life and everything centers on the ability to see and capture figure form, contrast and light/shadow.<br />For anyone searching for the classical drawing of the figure, get it and read it.

B000068QY7|5.0|Their other albums are good, but the first and this one, their last, have to be their best effort thus so far. I really liked \\"Songbird\\" and \\"She is Love\\" which reminded me of a song you might have heard in the seventies. (I can just see a video of it with a blonde woman barefooting around an open wheat field.) It's really good to listen to in the car with the sunroof open.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I wasn't expecting Star Wars, so I wasn't disappointed by this film. And while if it stood alone, it wouldn't have caused the kind of following, love and devotion the originals did, it was still a fine movie with a lot to recommend it. Star Wars: A New Hope was the meat of its trilogy. Lucas didn't know if he would ever be making sequels to it, therefore it contains all the emotional punch it needs to stand alone. The Phantom Menace was never intended to stand alone, and Attack of the Clones was so good I forgive PM for some of it's lacks in light of viewing it as The Introduction. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Except. For. That. Horrible. Kid. Of all the incredible young actors out there, and all the thousands of kids they auditioned, how could they have made such a terrible mistake? Or at the least, once they got started, how could George not have seen how stilted and awful Jake Lloyd was and recast the part? In my opinion he could have saved the movie in one fell swoop by doing so. I have to watch it despite Jake Lloyd's performance. As much time and money as Lucas spent revamping the original trilogy with new CG effects, I'm hoping at some point down the line he'll reshoot Anakin's role in The Phantom Menace with a different actor and use his digital wizardry to edit it in. Then you could get absorbed into the movie without being jolted back to reality every time Anakin walks onscreen. Then, it would truly be a Great Movie.
0446310786|4.0|TKAM is not just a novel about a man's struggle for justice &amp; truth; it is not just an indictment of racial prejudice &amp; blind conformity to traditions of society; it is not just about the agonized, confused growing up of two intelligent &amp; sensitive children - it is about man's struggle to be loyal to his conscience; about man's recognition of the sacredness of the human personality; about man's respect for man.<BR>Above all, it attacks that aspect of life which deserves the greatest denunciation in human existence - irrationality.<br />I would not call TKAM one of the greatest novels of the world of all times, but it is certainly an excellent one.<BR>One of the main reasons I'd offer for saying this is that it is not a novel which explores several ideas in all their depth and profundity, such as the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, neither is it a masterpiece in characterization - exploring the innermost recesses and complexities of the human soul, like the plays of Shakespeare.Therefore, I'd give it four-and-a-half points; but between a choice of 4 and 5, I'd select 5.<br />Nevertheless, it is a novel which captures several themes which are weighty by their basic import and weaves them into a story which brings them out wonderfully.<br />One of the best aspects of this novel is its perfectly delightful humor. <BR>It exudes a sense of joyousness &amp; benevolence, having been narrated from the perspective of an intelligent, precocious, sensitive, aggressively defiant and highly individualistic girl - Scout Finch, who, in the course of novel grows from the age of 6 to 9.<br />Another element which endeared me to this novel is its highly appealing characters, especially Atticus Finch - a man of conscience, honor, &amp; dignity, full of benevolence &amp; goodwill, and the perfect gentleman; a father who doesn't want to impose on his children the stifling tradition of society or family, but allows them their space to develop their distinct individuality, at thesame time inculcating in them, without the use of fear, a unique value system which can make them strong, proud, independent and compassionate individuals whom no tragedy and suffering can embitter or break.<BR>The character of Jem - Scout's elder brother, as intelligent, sensitive and proud as Scout, but less aggressive &amp; defiant &amp; obviously, comparatively more mature; Miss Maudie - firm but loving; and Cal are well-drawn &amp; lovable too.<br />Harper Lee has captured the mood and \\"feel\\" of country life - of a sleepy, old, rather poor &amp; conservative town; of a small boy stepping into adolescence; of a young child's very simple, straightforward &amp; honest way of looking at life, with great insight &amp; truthfulness.<br />In conclusion, TKAM is a must-read. It is a novel which re-affirms one's conviction in the innate goodness and nobility of the human soul.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Don't get mislead, this should not be categorized with the NYC garage scene (ex. The Strokes, YYYs).  Instead, this is intricate, beautiful rock at it's finest.  It's definetely Joy Division-esque, but not a rip off.  Interpol has there own definitive sound, and are not rehashing Ian Curtis and company.  If you want one of the years best releases, probably the best so far, then pick this up.  You will not be disappointed.  I guarantee this album being on every indie Top 10 of 2002.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is a 'right of passage' album. In my middle school years and early high school yeras, people might've had Korn and Limp Bizkit, but my metal gods were Sabbath. I remember sitting alone in my room for literally hours jamming to this album when I was 13 or 14. If you must own only one Sabbath album, make it this one. It has teen angst and demonic social commentary written all over it.
6305075352|2.0|I cannot comment on how closely this film tracked to the real life events that it supposedly follows. But as a movie, it falls short of it's potential by lapsing into the preachy and stereotypical Hollywood style which has become so commonplace in today's cinema. I doubt there are too many souls left today who would deny that the KKK did some horrific things, or that there wasn't a pervasive racist culture in the South in the early 60's. But if there are, this movie tries to dispel all remaining skeptics with the subtlety of a lead balloon. By trying to tie up hatred and bigotry into one neat little package (by compartmentalizing and homogenizing groups of people), the movie fails in a rather big way. I mean, how many times have we been fed the message that all southerners are ignorant racists, that all blacks are innocent bystanders barely capable of controlling their own destinies, or that liberal educated whites are the saviors of the human race. Hardly original (or truthful).<br />Beyond the problem of the \\"message\\", the movie has other faults. William Dafoe just isn't, in my opinion, believable at all. From his overly done \\"Kennedy-esque\\" appearance to his constant idealistic waning (the obvious target being the \\"uneducated audience\\"), his authenticity never rings true. And did dozens upon dozens of FBI agents really wade into the Mississippi swamps without regard for their expensive suits? Well, if they did, perhaps it just shows that educated Northern white boys aren't that smart after all! Finally, if director Alan Parker's intent was to leave us in the lurch regarding Anderson's and Mrs. Pell's \\"relationship\\", he succeeded with flying colors.<br />On a positive note, Gene Hackman's performance is excellent. He holds it all together....well, he IS the movie. His delivery, mannerisms and character make Mississippi Burning quite enjoyable to watch from a cinematic point of view. Also top notch was Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell. Their performances almost make up for a mediocre and all-too-often condescending film.
0060987464|4.0|I read this at the genesis of my \\"Manson Phase\\" in 1999. But then I read it again a year later and I got more out of it because I knew a lot more than I did during my initial phase of 'worshipping' Marilyn Manson.<BR><BR>Marilyn Manson is a very intelligent person, perhaps one of the most articulate people in show business. Some of the stuff he says in this book have become personal quotes, not so much now, but back then yes. It's very philisophical, but some of it was also perverse. I can understand the drug problems, and the tensions amongst his band mates, and his school and everyone else who may have oppressed him, but his sexual explorations and innuendos were somewhat uncalled for. I am not criticizing Manson or his lifestyle. I always believed that whatever decisions you have made add some piece to the puzzle of your existence that completely makes up who you are and who you will be for the rest of your life. But if I wanted to read about sex, I'd read Penthouse. <BR><BR>I absolutely loved how he made one full page of all the rumours that were spread about him, and his response in his journal about all of those rumours, such as the removing his two ribs so he can perform the Monica Lewinsky Treatment on himself, and how he was on the Wonder Years, the animal sacrifices and all of the rumours that he was gonna commit suicide at a show. To me that was a stroke of genius.<BR><BR>I may not be his biggest fan now, but after reading this, I began to understand Manson more than your average ignorant or open minded person would. I still respect him for sticking to his guns and not caring about what others think. But what kinda pisses me off is that whether he is onstage (great live performer by the way!), or offstage, he is still Marilyn Manson. There was no sense of Brian Warner whatsoever, and sometimes his persona is dehumanizing to his caliber. He hides behind stage makeup and mutilated tattered clothing, which is deemed pronographic by some. Of courtse it's supposed to add to his 'mystique' but when you're writing an autobiography, or a hagiography so personal as this one, you kind of have to step out of yourself for it. Even in some interviews. Take for example, Maynard James Keenan from Tool/Perfect Circle. When he's on stage he's Maynard, a God, an enigma, a shaman of sorts. But when he's offstage, doing interviews and whatnot, he's a simple man from Ohio with a candid and articulate personality, and someone who seems to be comfortable in his own skin, something Manson obviously isn't. Keenan offstage doesn't need his onstage antics or persona to float him or to make him completely unbelievable to his fans.<BR><BR>Overall, I recommend reading this book word by word without any biast about his music, or any rumours you may have heard from the Christian Right or any people who hate it. You're guaranteed at least some reaction, and probably a more intellectual reaction to Manson. Even some Manson haters liked this book, and agreed that he has a certain amount of intelligence.
6304795254|5.0|I thought this movie was great! Its one of those movies you just can't stop watching until the very last minute. It has parts that the audience wouldn't expect at all! But the one part that I just loved was the ending. A wonderful to watch I recommend this movie to people who like action-thrillers and like movies that make you think.

B000006OS2|1.0|This is a fine John Wayne film but much of it is missing in this DVD version.  This film appears to have been transferred to DVD by simply capturing the center 4:3 portion of the picture.  I don't know what the original aspect ratio of the film was, but there are a very noticeable number of scenes on this DVD in which the actors' faces are not visible because they are off the edge of the screen.  In other words, they didn't use pan-and-scan.  In addition, the image quality is not too good.  I noticed what seemed to be grainy artifacts from the video compression process.  Some scenes were out of focus.  This could have been from the original film but I doubt it.  The film this DVD was transferred from is very scratched.  I hope there is a better copy of the film around and that a real DVD manufacturer makes a quality letterboxed version.

Suspiria is a tour-de-force.

B000065U1N|5.0|I rented Black Hawk Down on dvd and the day after I bought it. It's a film about the horror and consequences of war. The film also sticks right to the book plot. Black Hawk Down is about a group of 100 American soldiers who landed in Mogadishu, Somalia to capture a warlord name Mohamed Fara Adid. The mission fails when two helicopters get shot down and crash. This film got jipped by A Beautiful Mind in the awards ceremony. It definetly should have won Best Director and Film. Black Hawk Down is an amazing story of courage under fire and modern war.

WHAAT?<BR>In my opinion nothing more than a pretencious attempt to make bad trashy pop culture.<BR>Oliver Stone was more interested on impressing  the teens that were not supposed to see the film (but do, as they always do) than in telling a coherent history.<BR>This flick is eyecandy for violence starved minds, but that is not what bothers me (my mind has craved for its share of visual violence more than one time). What bothers me is that unlike Dobermann or Mad Max or any other nice little violence flick, Natural Born Killers tries to redeem itself as a socially concious movie.<BR>...I would have given it only a star, but as I said, there are very nice looking scenes in the film...<BR>The Dinner scene... A cool looking killer and a blond chick making a bloddy mess... That was nice.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Yes the music is simple, no it isn't unique, no it is not revolutionary, but it is extremely enjoyable to listen to. This isn't alternative, heavy metal, or nu-metal. It's the stuff from the past, it's garage rock, and it's damn good. Overrated? Probably. But then again, so are most bands out there. Get over it, and just listen to it... not because it was hyped, because you just like it! So give it a chance.<br />Every song on this album is great, so it's really hard to choose favorites, however, I'll give it a shot :) <br />\\"Someday\\", \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Last Night\\" and \\"Take it or leave it\\" are probably my favorite songs but once again, it's a hard choice, and I'm being honest. <br />I'm a big metal head myself, I listen to bands like Tool and SlipKnot (etc) and I loved The Strokes, so it's really just a matter of giving it a chance and I can bet that it will grow on you and you will love it. Have fun.

B000069HKH|3.0|At the risk of sounding unpatriotic and unamerican (afterall how can anyone pan &#34;the boss&#34;) I think that &#34;The Rising&#34; falls flat, suffering largely due to its overproduction.<br /><br />I Love Bruce Springsteen.  I love his songwriting style, his &#34;grit&#34;, and his passion. But I think that whatever he was striving for on this album was lost in the production.<br /><br />Feelings relating to September 11th are hard to capture within the confines of a rock album, and while Springsteen makes a pretty good effort, &#34;The Rising&#34; doesn't quite elevate for me.  The power of the album drowns in a mixture of synth-keyboards and what often sounds like drum machines.<br /><br />Max?  Are you there?  And where is the &#34;Big Man&#34;?  Only on a few songs, it seems.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, there are a few standouts - &#34;Nothing Man&#34;, &#34;The Rising&#34;, &#34;Mary's Place&#34; and &#34;My City Of Ruins&#34;.  I think those tracks will help keep this album out of the bargain bins.  Even bad production can't keep the Boss down.<br /><br />GOD BLESS THE BOSS AND GOD BLESS THE USA!!! But....I think when I want to listen to Springsteen, I'll still reach for &#34;Nebraska&#34;, &#34;The Ghost of Tom Joad&#34;, et al.

A Day Without Rain is beautiful and Only Time well worth the purchase, but a sleeper is Pilgrim.  I could listen to that all day and not get tired of it.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Their 3-song EP and trickle of self-released singles/tracks set the bar high for Interpol- and they clear it easily with this full-length CD.  While these guys where their influences on the sleeves (Joy Div/New Order, MBV, Smiths, Wedding Present, Sonic Youth, 4AD sound, et. al.)- they are developing a sound that is not singularly derivative (like many indie bands debuts!!), similar to the direction Clinic is heading on the other side of the pond. (song exception- 'say hello to the angels', a little to self-consciously smiths/jam to me)  The slashing &amp; layered guitars with the brooding but melodic basslines create soaring harmonies- mirroring the hypnotic lyrics.  Stand out tracks are both 'Obstacles', Stella, Roland &amp; The New.  If you can obtain some of their older tracks (out of print, complations, etc.) like 'Precipitate', 'A time to be so small', and 'Song Seven' you can appreciate their longer development.  Also check out KCRW's website for an archived recorded live set &amp; interview.  If the holier-than-thou PFM gave it a 9.5/10 rating- that must mean something. Definitly a top-ten pick of '02.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns n Roses although considered by some to be the single most excessive rock band of the hedonistic 80's. A decade that brought us such unequivocal pop travesties as  Boy George, Poison,Flock of Seagulls,and  Bon Jovi. The same decade that elected Michael Jackson as the \\"The King of Pop\\" also yielded \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", 12 tales of debauchery, fame hunting greed, drug addiction and the brutal atmosphere of LA during the late 80's. The bands punk rock emotion fused together with their intense hard rock sound can't be denied on virtually every song on this album, from the seething ferociousness of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the gorgeous melody and intense guitarist/singer connection on \\"Sweet Child o Mine\\"to the raw attitude and funky feel of the drug addict anthem \\"Mr Brownstone\\". This album is a must for every hard rock fan yearning for a rock album devoid of high gloss power ballads, drum machine rhythms and overemoting lead singers more interested in their make up then their lyrics or their voice. This album is raw and worth the money.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Starting with \\"MIND\\" in 1972,followed by \\"BOOK\\",\\"INNERVISIONS\\",\\"FINALE\\",\\"LIFE\\" and the misstep \\"PLANTS\\",this was the last one of the great SW albums.No album he released afterwards came close (except 1987's \\"Characters\\").45 minutes of the anti-filler.You can read the track listing above for a refresher.After this album,there were momentary lapses of greatness (\\"That Girl\\",\\"Do I Do\\",almost anything off the CHARACTERS album and a few others).But for the most part there were too much time spent on psychobabble concepts like \\"IN SQUARE CIRCLE\\" or soundtrack disasters like \\"THE WOMAN IN RED\\".I guess the seventies wore SW out.<BR>THE ACTUAL ALBUM:Stevie used a who's who of \\"guest stars\\" to sing backup on various tracks.It worked.Michael Jackson & The O'Jays on \\"All I Do\\",The Gap Band on \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" and too many people to mention on \\"Happy Birthday\\".Why is the album so good? Excellent songwriting,subject matter,production and performance that's why.Lots of albums sold more,but this a sound investment.
6305127646|4.0|\\"The Saint\\" is an action and romance packed movie, featuring veteran actors Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue. \\"The Saint\\" was originally a television series in the 1960's featuring Roger Moore as the Saint. But as most cases are, this 1997 new movie version of the character of the Saint is only remotely close to the original. And again as most cases are, it isn't really such a bad thing. My suggestion is that if you have seen the original series and you are about to watch this movie, keep an open mind in that the character and the feel of Simon Templar is a bit different.<br />Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, the man of many faces and names. Though none other than a mercenary spy and a thief, he is always in the right as he thwarts enemies while giving British authorities a merry chase. The country of Russia is in chaos as there is a severe oil shortage. The people are rising in a revolution, the leader being Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) who is in actuality cheating and lying to all his 'fellow countrymen'. In fact he and his son, Ilya (Valeri Nikolayev) are your average power-hungry bad guys, in fact the ones who started a fake oil shortage! Their plan is to steal Dr. Emma Russell's (Elisabeth Shue) fusion power theory with the help of Simon Templar, thus getting more support from the people of Russia. But as Simon falls in love with the beautiful doctor (and she with him), he changes plans and helps her escape the Tretiak's while saving the Russian people dying from the cold.<br />Val Kilmer does a marvelous job in his character, all of his disguises and fake accents completely well-done. His many disguises change from a long-haired artist, a peppered gray mustache for a Russian, thinning hair and dorky face and glasses for a reporter, and more. His accents are the most well-done and range from a thick Russian accent, bright Australian accent, soft South African accent, and more! And Elizabeth Shue for me has certainly grown up, since I've only seen her as a teenager in \\"The Karate Kid\\" and \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\". Her acting is pretty good but I didn't really like her that much as I like most other heroines in other movies.<br />The story line is averagely good, and as some people have mentioned, at times the movie was a bit tedious and long-drawn. In my opinion, I think they could have cut out more of the romantic scenes and included more espionage, action, escapes, fights... you get the idea. I just felt that just when it was getting exciting, it was either suddenly cut short or the suspense was taken out. What action there was though was fantastic! Very exciting, the best scenes include the Saint stealing a microchip in the beginning and all the escapes from Tretiak's henchmen.<br />I feel that all action movies should always have a bit of humor instilled and \\"The Saint\\" does have its funny moments. I love the part in the beginning where Simon is just about to break into a building, discovers that the door isn't locked then remarks, \\"I love this country!\\" The ending is pretty funny also as he has a run in with some inspectors from Scotland Yard. Simon Templar's car horn is pretty cool!<br />Put it all together, \\"The Saint\\" is pretty fantastic if you have a free 2 hours to spare. As I said, if you've been a fan of \\"The Saint\\" and you're about to watch this movie, keep an open mind if you hope to enjoy it! The PG-13 rating is for adult situations and the action.<br />A bit of trivia: In the end of the movie, Simon turns on the radio and listens to an announcer. I wasn't sure but I was able to confirm that the radio announcer's voice is none other than Roger Moore, the man who played The Saint in the television series!

B00006G8G1|1.0|Let me first say that I am a huge Maiden fan.  However, this DVD is aweful.  I'll first start off with the sound issue.  There are major problems with the soundtrack, especially the Dolby Digital track.  The sound level fluctuates throughout the entire show as if someone is standing at your stereo receiver messing with the volume control.  This is EXTREMELY distracting.  I tried the DVD on 2 different Dolby Digital set-ups and got the same thing both times.  And if all you have is a Dolby Pro-Logic receiver you might as well forget about is as there is no 2 channel stereo mix provided - only Dolby Digital and DTS.  <br />The next issue, although not as bad as the sound issue, is the editing.  I have never seen so many camera changes in my entire life on a video.  The camera and angle changes every second or two - sometimes it changes within a split second.  It's enough to make you dizzy, or at least make your eyes hurt when you're done watching it.<br />I'm sure that you will see more reviews like mine soon.  Just check out the Maiden bulletin board where most people are complaining about these same matters.  I have to say that I am majorly disappointed with this as I was really looking forward to its release.  What a shame.  At least the CD release of this show is good.
0553213105|5.0|I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school.  While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.<br />I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign.  Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them.  And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.<br />By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.<br />Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations.  Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart.  She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.<br />&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative.  Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters.  At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy.  Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot.  As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other.  The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read.  Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.<br />To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot;  Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels.

B000002MUW|5.0|In October of 1994, Madonna had decided to put her clothes back on and move on to the next step in her career, when she released her ninth album entitled, BEDTIME STORIES. This album features a completely different sound than her previous albums. This album features a mixture of mid-'90s Pop, Smooth R&B, and Light Techno. This is another great album.  <br /> <br />SURVIVAL <br />  A great song about Madonna trying to survive in career, whether her career is going well or bad (\\"...Whether it's Heaven or Hell...\\"), but she'll be living to tell. <br /> <br />SECRET <br />  The first single from the album. This song is absolutely incredible. That acoustic guitar fused with a techno sound is, to me, the perfect combo. This is just a great song all together. <br /> <br />I'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />DON'T STOP <br />  While \\"Everybody\\" was a song that told us all to get up and dance (where the song was pretty aggressive), this song is a song that tells us to get up and dance (with a fun and calm sound). Great song. <br /> <br />INSIDE OF ME <br />  This song is actually about Madonna's mother. She's simply saying that she'll always keep the memory of her mother in her heart. <br /> <br />HUMAN NATURE <br />  The fourth & final single from the album. This song was Madonna's way of telling the critics to back off. The critics constantly bashed Madonna from 1992 to 1993, while she ran around during her sexual escapade. In this song, Madonna tells her critics that she's not sorry for what she did, and that it was her own \\"Human Nature\\". Way-to-go, Madonna. <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />  A great song here. <br /> <br />LOVE TRIED TO WELCOME ME <br />  This another one of the prettiest ballads Madonna has ever recorded. <br /> <br />SANCTUARY <br />  Great. Strange, but great. <br /> <br />BEDTIME STORY <br />  The third single from the album. This is a great song, and it is another one of my favorites. The music video is a \\"Bedtime Story\\" destined to give children nightmares for it's freakish and creepy atmosphere. <br /> <br />TAKE A BOW <br />  The second single from the album. This was Madonna's eleventh #1 hit (Billboard Hot 100), with the tenth #1 (Billboard Hot 100) being \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" (back in 1992). This song spent seven to nine straight weeks at #1 (Billboard Hot 100). This is one of Madonna's greatest pieces of work. Even her stupid should-not-be-allowed-to-give-their-opinions Critics loved this song. <br /> <br />     This is a great album here and all you Madonna fans should have this album. This album was also underrated and should have been given the chance it deserved. Great album here.
B000068TPN|5.0|This film is very captivating and will run the gamut of emotions.  Mel Gibson was, as usual, outstanding and enthralling.  He brings insight to those who were not there and remembrance to those who were. <br />The accurate portrayal of the phosphorus grenades, the napalm, the medevacs and the senseless chaos of war seemed to eclipse time and mentally reinstate the ghastly images, putrid smells,  and brutal sounds that inhabit the recesses of a soldiers mind forever.<br />The accurate depiction of the various segments of war also displayed the camaraderie between soldiers; the teamwork and cohesiveness so necessary for survival.<br />This is a movie that will make the veteran remember.  However, it also has the comprehension and mastery to captivate and enchant those who have never been to war.  It spares no emotions and is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers is a powerful story and a powerful movie with Mel Gibson at his very best. Gibson is incredible as he depicts the horror of that battle so well in his body language and facial expressions, particularly his eyes. Definitely Oscar material.<br />As a Vietnam veteran, I was moved by the extraordinary violence and horror our American boys had to endure in that early battle. There were many more horrific years that followed, but this one was especially shocking for the young men thrust into its ugly jaws without knowing just how bad it would be.<br />Powerful on the big screen and powerful on DVD in a home theater.<br />This Vietnam vet highly recommends it.
6305922756|3.0|It doesn't help that I've been watching Christopher Guest's films in reverse chronological order starting with Best in Show, then Waiting for Guffman, and now This is Spinal Tap.  I would think this film broke new ground in the rockumentary/mockumentary genre *at* the time.  It takes the audience through daily life with the rock group called Spinal Tap.  The movie is shot like a featurette with a director interviewing the band members and following them around as they tour.  It also shows the ups and downs of being a rock group.  One minute they would be on top with stadiums packed with 5,000 audience members.  The next minute, they could be barely foist their albums despite signings and appearances.  <br />This film employs very dry humor.  It's funny because it attempts to be serious.  The writers have made it a point to mock rockstars.  They're airheads.  David, the lead singer of the band, is constantly saying dumb things like every year countless people spontaneously combust.  Nigel is obssessive with his guitar collection.  The drummers seem to die and get replaced constantly.  Band members stuff cucumbers down their crotch.  It's entirely believable that these things happen with rockstars, but this film showcases a selection of stereotypes in one fell swoop.<br />(I think this film was fun to watch.  I could not believe the number of well-known celebrities that played a minor role in this film including Dana Carvey, Paul Schafer, Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher (she looked so young).)<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 3 (stereotypes well captured for each character)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<BR>A (Action) - 0 (n/a)<BR>P (Plot) - 2 (the life of a rock group)

B00005O3VC|3.0|The film started out so well.  It had the opening credits with screwed up bogus subtitles, hilarious horse-riding with no horse, smart-alec peasants arguing with a king.  What's not to like, right?  Boy, was I wrong.  The film just took a turn for the worse, when they tossed in the really horrible animation of God giving them the mission of finding the Holy Grail.  They also mixed the present (932 AD) with the future (1975 AD).  It didn't work for me.  The last 30 minutes just bored me.  I couldn't wait for it to just be over with.<br />I remember liking other Monty Python features more than this.

B00005JK8K|3.0|Windtalkers is the latest (and probably the last) in a long line of seemingly never-ending war films. It all began with Enemy at the Gates and since then, we've had Pearl Harbor, Uprising (yeah, it's TV, but it counts), Black Hawk Down, Hart's War, We Were Soldiers, and now Windtalkers, a John Woo war film that is, unsurprisingly, graphically violent and combat-oriented.<br />The movie itself claims to tell the story of the Windtalkers, Navajo codetalkers who were vital to the U.S. military in the South Pacific during the second world war. Adam Beach plays one such codetalkers and Nicolas Cage is his bodyguard assigned to protect the code \\"at all costs.\\" If you go into the film expecting an in-depth look at these codetalkers, you're going to be pretty disappointed. The actual film plays more like a series of deadly situations that a squad faces, which serve pretty much as excuses for John Woo to show his action prowess. <br />The battle scenes, the film's true selling point, are mostly effective for what they are, though there are a few clunkers. The massive-scale fight for Saipan is impressive and quite a tense, lengthy sequence. It's probably the most epic modern infantry combat scene featured on film since the D-Day opening to Saving Private Ryan. A skirmish in a Japanese village definitely features John Woo's signature kinetic touch, and it's probably the movie's most exciting action sequence. Unfortunately, not all these moments work. The battle on the mountain, for instance, is hard to swallow. At one point in this segment, four U.S. marines manage to kill around fifty Japanese soldiers, as would be my rough estimate. Hell, there's even a scene where Nicolas Cage, lying on the ground, whips out his colt .45, and without properly aiming, fires four shots in quick succession and takes down four enemy soldiers charging down a hill!<br />Aside from all the battle scenes (five in all, if you count the massacre in the opening), there isn't much else worth mentioning. The story is played out in a routine, predictable fashion and some of the characters (whether it's the gung-ho Racist, the scared Greek, or the Guy Who's Afraid His Wife is Cheating on Him) are mostly one-note and stereotypical. I didn't learn much about Navajo Windtalkers, and what codetalking was featured could have just as easily been delivered in plain English without any effect on the battle. To be fair, though, the friendships developed between the codetalkers and their bodyguards is palpable and even slightly touching at times (bolstered by the decent performances from the four leads: Cage, Beach, Willie, and surprisingly enough, Christian Slater, who's almost always awful in everything he's in).<br />You're not going to learn anything new watching Windtalkers, but it's a so-so effort that war film buffs will probably want to catch just for the blistering action. It's a rather plotless, unoriginal, cliched, and occasionally very dull (when it's off the battlefield) affair that would have worked better had there been greater focus in the script.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****

0792153189|3.0|As apocalyptic disaster movies go this is one of the better ones. It keeps the special effects to a minimum- focussing instead on the various human storylines that run through it. Deep Impact's strong cast includes Tea Leoni, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Maximilian Schell. The one criticism I would have of this movie is that it's myriad of individual storieslines when taken in conjunction fail to work. Courageously, perhaps, the film's directors have tried to balance incredible cinematic spectacle with personal stories of great emotional import. The only problem is that there are quite simply too many stories. As a result no individual plot line is developed sufficiently in the 117mins running time to garner the viewers sympathy. The film would have benifited greatly from the axeing of at least one of its subplots or possibly just having one narrative thread instead of several. There are inevitably several moments of beauty and pathos yet the sense of tradegy would have been so much greater if only this excellent cast had been given the scope within the film to develop their characters more. As regards the cast Morgan Freeman contributes his customary powerful performance as the US president. Tea Leoni is muted but engaging in what is probably the main role. Her performance tends to stagnate somewhat as the film progresses. Vanessa Redgrave contributes an excellent cameo as Leoni's mother but is only seen briefly. Max Schell lacks charisma and  Elijah Wood's undoubted talents are utterly wasted as Leo Biederman. The film is, however, well paced and succeeds in building a great tension in the viewer as it approaches its climax. It raises intersting questions about democracy and the role of the State in the case of such a catastrophe. They are questions, unfortunately, which it does not choose to pursue to any great extent.<BR>Deep Impact is a highly viewable film but in the end too ambitious for its own good. Its ultimate message of hope in the midst of disaster rings true and it contains many stories of courage and sacrifice. In the end though this is a film that sacrifices too much to its over-ambitious excess of plot lines for it to attain the level of true greatness.
B000002H97|1.0|What a horrible album. How can anyone listen to this an enjoy it? There is not one quality song on it. Metallica used to be a pretty decent band, but this album is just horrible pop rock... What happend to the great thrash records like Kill em all, or Ride The Lightning? How could a band go from so good to so bad so quick? I really don't understand how anyone could like this.

I remember being horribly bored, with pictures of taking \\"forever\\" cruising around the new Enterprise, showing me how \\"ooh\\",\\"ahh\\",\\"pretty\\", the new Enterprise was.  And showing me \\"look how much like Star Wars we are\\" special effects.  I vowed at that time that I would never watch this boring thing again.  When this DVD version came out, I had heard it was supposed to have been improved.  I figured, \\"OK, I'll give it another chance.\\"  Well, this did a great job of reminding me why I vowed I'd never watch this thing again.  It's still as boring, for all the same reasons, as it was 22 years ago.  Yawn.
B000002KHH|4.0|There are only two songs I like and those two songs are War Pigs, and Faries Wear boots. I think those two songs show the real talent of Black Sabbath. This is my least favorite of the first six Black Sabbath albums, simply because the songs are to radio friendly. If you wan't the best of Black Sabbath check out there debut or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, those two records show there brilliance. If you like Catchy rock songs this album is for you but I prefer other Sabbbath records over this.

This is a true story, except for one thing. It was a British sub which stole the enigma machine in WWII, not an American sub.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I've been aware of Pink Floyd for at least the last 30 years, and I can tell that there is no track here not heard before, except maybe for the Watersless Floyd ones. <br />I rate this 3 stars for the tunes selection. I understand it's way hard to select the \\"best\\", coz each album up to The Final Cut were best on their own right. Any Pink Floyd fan have preferred tunes over the others, so it is impossible to make everybody happy, besides cutting the tracks from their albums context; but some missings are unforgivable, think of Piper's \\"Chapter 24\\",  Saucerful's \\"Remember a Day\\", Ummagumma's \\"Grantchester Meadows\\", Atom Heart Mother's \\"If\\", \\"Summer 68\\", or \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", Meddle's \\"Fearless\\", Obscured by Clouds' \\"Childhoods End\\", Dark Side's \\"Eclipse\\", Wish You's \\"Have a Cigar\\", Animals' \\"Pigs\\", Final Cut's \\"South Hampton Dock\\" or \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", etcétera and I'm skipping More.<br />I know there's enough material for more than a third disc, but the Eugene doing the editing could've use the axe smarter and save space from Division Bell lame tracks adding some of the aforementioned ones.<br />Anyway, the 4th star is deserved for the leaflet art and graphics, always a Pink Floyd strenght, if only the lyrics were more visible, but all of us already know them. Cheers.
B00004XMTH|2.0|I cannot bring myself to give this title more than two stars, although I love the stage production of this show.  The singing and acting on this DVD are somewhat disappointing, and the original broadway cast sounded much better.  The camera work is horrendous, constantly showing close ups when they should be panning out to show the wonderful choreography that was made for the stage.  It seems as though there was no modification to the show to make it look good on TV.  While I'm sure there are purists who are glad that there weren't any chages (&quot;It's supposed to be JUST like the stage production&quot;), it just looks bad on television.<br />When I saw this version of the musical it was running on PBS.  I noticed that a few of the songs were actually missing from the production and it was not complete.  I realize that the songs may have been cut by PBS to fit the musical into an allotted time, but if this is not the case, the DVD just isn't worth it.
B000002GBB|5.0|I am a true Styx fan, and believe Pieces Of Eight was a particular highpoint album for the band. After the success of Grand Illusion, they probally wondered how to keep the ball rolling, which brings me to the unusual cover art for this album. Does anyone know about the origins of using this photograph of a woman with Easter Island earrings, in what appears to be different stages of life(young to old/grey hair)? The one story I heard years ago was that the band felt so confident with their success after the Grand Illusion(public Knowledge of the band), that they would try a cover with no name(the album when released had no name/title on the cover, only on it's side spine). The front-center photograph seems to echo the artistic face on the previous album, and the Earrings definetly must elude to the track &quot;Aku Aku&quot;, which also was the title of a book about Easter Island by the adventurer Thor Heyerdahl. If anyone has more info., please feel free to respond.
B00002MZ4W|1.0|Like many, if not most, of the people who bought this CD, I was hoping for something like her absolutely brilliant first album. It was disappointing to find that she'd hit the usual musician's sophmore slump, producting an album that contains none of the bluesy, hard-edged beauty of her previous effort. I've already given the CD away, as I had no desire to hear it again. <br />She does have an awesome track on the 'Plesantville' sound track, though!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Yes, 70 minutes is far to short to capture the sheer variety of themes and passages that the movie possesed in its complete score- and yes, we eagerly await the full recording of it.  Every time I listen to this I catch something new in it- and there are parts of this soundtrack that just floor me, they are so beautiful and heart-rendingly sad and powerful.  If you have EVER read the books (and even if you havent seen the film- though its a big BIG payoff if you read the books beforehand) then I cant recommend this score enough.  You cant be dissapointed- because no matter what your taste is in music, the is something in here that will give you a new insight into and appreciation of Tolkien's world.<br />- The true theme for the Fellowship is heard throughout the score, but is stated best in track 11: The Ring Goes South- when the orchestra puts its full might behind it, and plays it powerfully. It comes across as innocent, courageous, yet mindful of the dark journey it serves as an introduction to.<br />- The way Howard Shore uses startling contrasts in the music to engage the emotions is best exemplified in track 7: A Knife in the Dark- about a minute and a half in.  Thats when Saruman's  dark theme gets its full treatment, wonderfully dark and crashing, almost mechanical- and then it pauses, as a voice suddenly sings out, hopeful, astonishingly beautiful. Its like the pitch black of a storm suddenly pierced by a beam of light- and then the storm crashes back again, with renewed determination.  Beauty interrupting darkness (and yes, you aren't mistaken- the orchestra IS rattling chains in the background!)<br />- Darkness in the score is ultimatly conquered by the truly stunning pieces for the Hobbits, for Rivendell, the Great River, and the end credits.  The hobbits have a truly innocent and joyously peacful piece in track 2- it really makes one wish that there will be more to it in the longer album.  Rivendells theme in track 9 and 10, is perfect for the film- itevokes fading majesty and old-world grandeur, yet has a hope to it too.  The Great River music in track 15 powerful and sweepingly vast, and has to be heard to be appreciated really.  <br />And what can I say about the end?  At the end of the day I find it's what I appreciate most about the score- it somehow fulfills all the hope I had for the movies to be like I had hoped . . . it leaves the somewhat heavyhanded dark attitude and overdone battle scenes behind and presents the listener with all the hope and faith and beauty that the story is truly about.  Enya contributes to this, overwhelming with her May It Be at the very last, and bringing it to an uplifting close.  Which is all we can ask of this score, and the ones to follow- that everything will be right in the end . . . which this score is.
0805066349|5.0|A great book, but actually rather depressing.  <BR>Anyone interested in Native American History should make this book a must.  I am now rereading the book, and probably will return to it again, and again.
B000002U82|5.0|This album set a new standard for it's genre. Dark Side of the Moon is easily one of the best albums ever recorded, regardless of style. This album is an absolute masterpiece.  It is not album that fits into any one category.  I wasn't a fan of Pink Floyd until a friend gave me this album.  I had no idea the brilliance this album contained.<br /><br />  The ambiance coupled with a very rock sound.  This album is virtually seamless.

B00002MZ12|5.0|I used to think Alanis Morissette is a bucket of ... I got a few friends who are crazy about her songs. Whenever they tried to play her CD I always ask them to turn it off. I thought her songs were bad and she always sings out of rhythm. The only thing she does is to keep yelling and murmuring... This misconception came to an end when I first heard her live version of <That I would be Good> of the radio. I was blown away. The lyrics were so heart-felt and I could almost melt at her feet (provided she sings in front of me!) This song kept running through my mind until one day I decided to check it out in the local record store. <br />This Unplugged album is magic! The moment I heard the sound over the headphone I thought I was at her concert and every breath that she took to sing a note breathes oxygen into my blood! I knew I had to own it. I am glad I did! If you are not yet a fan, this one will turn you into one. Get it!
B00005OM4N|3.0|Whatever happened to the erstwhile innocent schoolgirl who sang sugar-sweet love songs? Britney's latest offering may be described by some as a testament to her maturity, but it seems that some of her songs are mature in the wrong way. <BR>\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" has cool lyrics about dancing and eclectic synthesizers, but the beat sounds like it is being played on a garbage can. There are more oohs and ahhs than actual lyrics, which makes this tune sound rather much like an Ex-Lax commercial. <br />\\"Boys\\" suffers from the same problems, including the lines \\"shake my thang\\" and \\"get nasty\\". Unfortunately, Britney's forays into hip hop aren't very good. <BR>However, there are many good songs on this album.<BR>\\"Overprotected\\" is a great song, with the classic-Britney orchestral hits and self-affirming lyrics, along with a danceable beat and a nice melody. <BR>\\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" is another high-water mark, reminiscent of Lilith Fair singer-songwriter music and relating to the lives of teens. <BR>And of course, her cover of Joan Jett's \\"I Love Rock And Roll\\" simply rocks. As Britney is the prime exemplar of rock stardom, it is quite apropos that she cover this song. Her vocals fit the melody entirely, and it sounds as strong and anthemic as ever. <BR>In conclusion, Britney's new album is a capable blend of classic Britney sweetness with hip-hop, alternative, and punk influences, and should appeal to a wide audience.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Star Wars Episode 1 maybe a disappointment ,but George Lucas always keeps something special in store, waiting to the perfect moment. When DVD's were expanding he released Episode 1 on DVD with a 2 disc set and tons of special features including totally redone deleted scenes how can we be mad at the guy that his life is build apon Star Wars(and Indiana Jones, but thats another story). I saw episode 1 again after the Attack of the <BR>Clones(bore) and I gave it a thought that truly it wasn't a bad movie(,but it was the Willow of the Star Wars Trilogy). It needed connections to the IV, V, and VI episodes or else this was a totally differant movie. So if you liked this one you my like episode 2 better!
B000069HKH|5.0|Springsteen ,put simplistically,chronicles the world of the white male blue collar worker and has done so throughout his career.His music treats of their dreams ,and yearnings,and reflects the hopes and aspirations of a group conspicuously absent from  \\"literary\\"writers.It seems to me that his vision is clear eyed and unsentimental and has changed with the passing of the years to reflect the state of the nation.The disillusion many feel  has been expressed but always with an undercurrent of hope.The hope arises from indomitability.The human spirt is indomitable.So what if the automobile ride, that on Born to Run gives rise to the possibilty of escape and freedom ,justs ends in another hick town at the end of another turnpike? Take a deep breath,cleave to your loved one and keep going.<BR>The vision grew darker during the era of Reagonomics,which tore the heart out of the heartland,its death throes being chronicled in the desperate beauty that was the Nebraska album.The Tom Joad album treated of the new dispossessed and was a mature work of astonishing and fraught power.The sales of these two albums were unspectacular and the public seemed tuned into The Boss only in full on Born in the USA mood<BR>Well The Rising is in sound and texture a return to those days with the E Street Band back and back to its majestic best.But the landscape has changed.<BR>The streets are not full of movement.They echo to the sound of death,and are full of the acrid stench of death,fire and smoke.The streets are deserted.The sky is gloomy.The spirit is clothed in despair and anguished questions remain unanswered.<BR>Love still shines but is now bruised and tarnished from the smoke and the bruised spirit hurts like it never has before.<BR>The mood may not have a name.What it does have is a date .9/11.<BR>Many of the dead on that day were from New Jersey.Springsteen people.The death that cast its shadow that day did so over the men and women about whom he has written from day 1.The cries ofpain and loss came from the throats of his people.The agony was universal<BR>So too,was the resolve.So too was the strength and courage to deal head on with loss and its consequences.This is often dealt with by images of the commonplace, here carrying with the ease that marks true power,a weight of emotion and evocation that is truly extraordinary.<BR>\\"Coffee cup's on the counter<BR>Jacket on the chair<BR>Paper's on the doorstep<BR>But you're not there\\"<br />Yet ,and this is what truly makes this an extraordinary album ,there is fun and a smile was playing across my face as I heard \\"Waitin For A Sunny Day\\" Its musical diversity is substantial -with gospel fervour ,stadium anthems and on some tracks a hint of early Van Morrison.<BR>The title song too is saying that when death is eyeballing you the importance of life becomes all the more obvious and is expressed by the power of song,the healing balm of music and the redemptive value of love.<BR>The album illuminates.It inspires.Music does not save lives.Firefighters do.Medics do.Music can make life worth saving It says to the emergency worker in Nothing Man,broken by his experience ,that you are a heron and you have transcended the horror and reached a place of beauty did you but know it.<BR>Blood.Fire.Dust.Dark.Empty.<BR>All words the recur in the album<BR>So too do Hope.Faith.Strength.Courage<BR>We may be desperate but we are not alone.<BR>Another title from another American musical great could apply to this album--Fanfare for the Common Man <BR>To go back to an earlier word The spirit is indomitable,the land is indomitable,its people are indomitable<BR>This album proclaims and proves this
630560973X|5.0|Star Trek IV: Voyage Home was the best so far out of the series!<BR>I love how they travel to the 20th century and they try to cope with our invirement. Awesome direction by Leonard Nimoy and all of the crew of the Enterprise are neat too. Need to see 1-3 before seeing this one(It doesn't make sense till after watching Search of Spock)
B00003CXAY|5.0|I've been a fan of both movies for a long time, and have seen Koyaanisqatsi performed live a number of times.  I heartily recommend that if you have a chance to see a live performance, you go - far more intoxicating than having the soundtrack come through the theater's speakers.<br />You can read more about the content of the movies elsewhere in here, so I won't get into that. FOr my money, the music of both movies - which is quite different - fits perfectly with the on-screen action.  The frenetic pace of Koyaanisqatsi's car ride saddled with the frenetic music is a real trip, and when it finishes, and goes back to slow, there's always a sense of relief and a sigh of \\"Wow - I've not been breathing!\\" from the audience.<br />I have played both of these movies as part of my church's movies series, hitting mainly the topic of stewardship (of our resources and our bodies and our neighbors), which is, for me, the message that I take from these movies.  Of course, there are many other messages, and being purely visual without dialogue or story, one can see and find many, many areas of discussion.<br />These are two powerful movies, that at least for me, after seeing them, my thinking about life and the world and people and consumption was forced into a more sensitive-to-others and sensitive-to-me approach.<br />Watch these movies, and you will be moved. Even my mother, who absolutely abhored Philip Glass, sat through Koyaanisqatsi with me and thought it kinda cool and wasn't put off by the music as she otherwise would have been.<br />In the realm of top movies, these two are in my list of favorite, and most affecting, films I've seen.
0061020710|5.0|The Discworld series is absolutely hilarious, wonderfully entertaining reading, but it is not quite perfect.  The plots are a little too...well...similar to each other.  Someone or another is always saving discworld from imminent doom...the ending is always just a little too overdramatized, and not quite coherent enough.<br />But The Color of Magic is the exception.  The characters don't end up on some cosmic quest to save the universe.  Instead, they are flung around wildly by the forces of ridiculously good luck and absolutely horrible luck, Rincewind hanging on by his fingernails and Twoflower just enjoying the ride.  I find that this sort of story, with its totally unpredictable plot turns and its charming, not-so-heroic characters, draws me in much more than the standard out-to-save-the-world Discworld book.<br />Don't get me wrong: the rest are great.  Terry Pratchet is a comic genius.  In my opinion, Discworld is Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's only real competition for funniest, funnest (a word which has been brought into existence solely for this purpose) and most ridiculous series of all time.<br />Yes, the other books are good, but if you are a Discworld reader who has somehow missed Color of Magic, or just a humor or fantasy fan who has somehow missed the series altogether, this particular book is a must.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce is back, finally!  I haven't been fully satisfied with a Springsteen album since Born in the USA, until now.  Every song here has something to say.  The 9/11 theme is handled with grace and dignity that only Springsteen could provide.  The E-Streeters sound better than ever.  If you were left wanting by the 1990's version of Bruce, this CD will be a welcome addition to your collection.
B00005QXDD|4.0|pop this cd in for a good time. a lot of the comedy skits made me laugh, butr JB and KG show a lot of good musicianship. a gave this album 4 stars because i tihnk there needs to be more music and less comedy. still &quot;Drive thru&quot;, and &quot;Inward Singing&quot; had me on the floor. Overall good album, pop it in for a good time
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Alas, I do not own the platinum DVD edition. I only have the pewter, VHS tape edition. But a gorgeous movie is a gorgeous movie. Before this film's release, I was convinced that nothing could hold a candle to Disney's version of \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" And his production team virtually abandoned fairy stories from 1960 on, concentrating on a much more slapstick, comic avenue of films. But this movie mirrors everything that was in style with his classic fairy tales-- from a musical score as sophisticated as anything on the Broadway stage, to a stunning adaptation of the book (which enhances the will and affection of the heroine 100%), to graceful, genteel, and just plain beautiful animation. I remember being in the theater and hearing the \\"oohs\\" at the scene of Belle and the Beast in formal dress, as they dance to the title song (seen from the wonderful chandelier crane shot). This was the moment I knew I was watching something stellar. When it received a best picture Oscar nomination, I cheered right in front of the TV.
0345440900|5.0|I received a copy for a baby shower gift - My husband heard about the book on a talk radio show so I got him a copy and we both are reading this book.  We love her philosophy and her tips are excellent.  It has opened the door for many excellent discussions/conversations around child rearing and our thoughts and feelings about her point of view.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B000066NW0|4.0|When I first heard Complicated on the radio I knew I had to check out this CD...so I went out and got it and the good part is yes, the music does live up to expectations.  The pop tracks are for the most part creative and even the ones that aren't are still sufficiently catchy.  Plus the rock tracks are heavy enough to be played on rock radio (I hope this album gets airplay, it deserves more than the Top-40 along with all that cra...sorry I meant rap).  And I have to mention the ballad I'm With You, an awesome slow track.  <br />But here is the problem.  Listening to the music I was impressed with the themes and lyrics, and thought, finally something not superficial and stupid in the pop genre.  Then I saw the videos, and all I can say is what the *****.  Running through a mall screwing stuff up? (Complicated)  Destroying cards on the street and painting graffiti? (Skater Boi).  The 'punk' attitude is so incredibly lame and destroys the album for me.  Especially for people that know real punk, and Avril is not it.  I put a lot of weight in my musical decisions on how I like the people behind the music, through interviews, ect. and this is really no better than Britney Spears.
0316666343|4.0|This book is not so much about murder as it is about grief. The narrator is a 14 year old girl in heaven looking down upon her family as they all go through the grieving process in different ways. This is a beautifully written novel that explores the so many different emotions that come with tragedy - anger, sadness and confusion. I don't want to give anything away - just know it's not your average murder mystery. The book is currently making it's way through my friends & family and each have enjoyed it a great deal.
0312243022|3.0|I have great respect for the fact that this book was probably brilliant, but for whatever reason, I could never get into it. It probably has something to do with the fact that there wasn't a whole lot going on. The book is primarily about relationships, and the nature of these relationships is revealed through a look inside the heads of the three protaganists, not through any action, or even much dialogue. Fortunately, it is short, so I was able to read the entire thing, despite my lack of enthusiasm. I did regret my half-hearted effort at the end, when a neat twist revealed itself. It probably didn't help that I haven't read the Virginia Wolff book &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Apparently, more brilliance would have been apparent to me if I had had some familiarity with that work as well.
B00006BTCA|5.0|There have been some strong, great second albums this year, notably by Doves and Coldplay.  For the last few months, those have been my favorites of the year.  Until this, the debut album by Interpol.  Some of the bands that I have heard spoken in the same breath as Interpol are Joy Division, The Chameleons, Wire, New Order, The Strokes, The Smiths, etc.  And while I do hear the connections (I am a huge Joy Division/New Order fanatic), this fine NYC quartet makes their own joy(ful) sound.  It is fresh, dark, inspiring, moody, uplifiting and, above all, very good, all in the course of 49 gorgeous minutes.  My favorites have to be &quot;Obstacle 1&quot;, which is VERY JD/NO sounding, &quot;PDA&quot; and &quot;Say Hello To The Angels&quot;, which sounds like the 3rd part of the &quot;This Charming Man&quot;/&quot;Last Nite&quot; trilogy of jangly guitar numbers.  Album of the year bar none.  It may be album of the year next year as well.  Classic!
B0000584V3|5.0|I took a chance and bought Opeth's album, Morningrise about a year ago and I never looked back.  Within a month, I had purchased every one of their CD's -- yes, they are that good.  Do yourself a favor and give them a listen.  If you like it dark and hard, and you don't mind a little softness every now and then; then Opeth is the band for you.<br />Blackwater Park is an awe-inspiring album by a band that continues to demonstrate that muscianship and quality song-crafting can exist in death metal.<br />Although to be fair, I don't personally consider Opeth to really be a death metal band.  They may have started out as one, but they have progressed way beyond that now.  Yes, they are agressive and fast, but then the band does a three-sixty and segues into an acoustic interlude that can be both beautiful and heartbreaking.  <br />The duo of Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren is perhaps one of the best guitar pairings today.  The two compliment each other so well that it brings back memories of Dave Murray & Adrian Smith from Iron Maiden's glory days.  While Opeth's style is considerably differnt from IM's, the ability of the two guitarists to mesh so completely with one another makes a world of difference in the final product.<br />The rhythm section of Martin Lopez and Martin Mendez is nothng to slouch at either.  Each has the goods and knows how to deliver them -- in pefect harmony with the rest of the band.  The album has some of the heaviest bass lines to be heard and the quality production makes sure that each instrument stands out without being over-powering or ending up being lost somewhere in the mix.<br />The quality of the songs on this CD is exceptional -- there isn't a bad one in the bunch.  Each track stands out on its own as a masterpiece.  Some of my favorites are 'The Leper Affinity,\\" \\"Bleak,\\" \\"Harvest,\\" and the \\"The Drapery Falls.\\"  While I don't dislike Mikael's growling, death metal-style vocals, I really do like to hear him do a cleaner vocal job;hence my choice of these tracks in particular.  \\"Harvest\\" stands out because of it's heart-felt, almost pleading lyrics.  While it isn't quite up to the beauty of \\"Face of Melinda\\" or \\"Benighted\\" from their CD Still Life, it still shows the opposite ends of the music spectrum that Opeth manages to cover in just one CD.<br />Opeth is a very unique band; one that is able to meld the power and aggression of death metal with the acoustic beauty of a doom and gloom darkwave/goth band.  If you have never heard anything by Opeth, then you may want to give this (or any one of their other great albums) a try.<br />While their album, Morningrise, is the favorite of most fans, Blackwater Park is never a disappointment.  I think it is a great companion to their previous one, Still Life.  So load up your CD player with those three, sit back and bask in the glow of what happens when you combine great songs, muscianship and pride into one band.<br />Forget all about rap metal and guitarists that couldn't play a solo to save their lives -- there's plenty of hot guitar work to make you itch to start playing air-guitar again . . . and don't forget about doing some serious headbanging too, while you're at it.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Whether you like the film or not, the DVD is garbage for one simple reason. There are NO chapters or scene selection capabilities! Is this Lynch's ego trying to out-weird himself?  I have never bought a DVD without this feature and usually it's a huge reason to opt for the DVD.  If you have to stop the feature for some reason, you either have to pause it forever or stop it and then have to start all over. It's idiotic and unbelievably inconsiderate of his fans, like he's thumbing his nose at them after he's got their money. Sorry, but that just makes him a jerk in my book. If you want the film, save some money and do yourself a huge favor. Get the VHS version.

0060930187|2.0|I have a bad habit of reading the reviews for books before I start reading and I often find myself wondering if I read the same book everyone else did. The Bell Jar was one of those books. I'd heard from several classmates that it was a wonderful book, and I read very positive reviews from this very website, but I found the book to be quite the opposite of what I had expected. Perhaps The Bell Jar is a work that is very limited in it's scope of readers, or perhaps I completely missed the point of this book being written, though I've always prided myself as being a very diligent reader. I read it in one sitting, though I was constantly begging myself to put it down, and I still could not find the connections between all the events in the book. This is a story about the (rather dull) everyday life of a depressed woman where most (if not all) of the notable events take place in the mind. And while stories like this must certainly inspire those in similar positions, I beleive that the events in books should fit together to be unified at the conclusion, and The Bell Jar did not do this for me. There were parts of it I enjoyed and parts that I may even remember, but, having heard the compliments of other reders, I'll humor myself in believing I've read the wrong book.
B000005ALP|5.0|This record is simply amazing.  I've yet to hear another album that flows so well from track to track--almost seamlessly.  Eels mastermind E is always coming up with better than great stuff (just check out any other Eels album for proof) and really established a high-water mark here on the first Eels album.  The melodies, all simple, almost childlike at times, are straightforward and reel you in immediately.  The opening track \\"Novocaine For The Soul,\\" the song for which the band is known largely to the public, is a wonderful pop creation, pure ear candy.  The narrative \\"Susan's House,\\" a spoken/sung track that incorporates a jazzy upright bass sound, an old school hip-hoppish drumbeat sound, and a Gladys Knight & The Pips piano sample into the chorus, is the most experimental track here, for a band known for mucho experimentation, but it still sounds as flawless and like something you could hear on the radio (that is, if radio actually paid any attention to the Eels) as the other tracks.<BR>   As always, E's lyrics deal with his usual stuff--chronicles of his status as the smart, cynical, too-cool for mass consumption outsider (\\"Guest List\\"), then there are the character sketches (\\"Beautiful Freak.\\")  It's been a few years since this came out, and there are a lot more songwriters that write similar lyrics to E, but nobody does this stuff better than E.
0140186409|2.0|I am also a teen who had to read this book for high school summer reading, and I entirely disagree with the statement of teens not being able to read \\"mature\\" books.  I think George Orwell was a great writer (1984 especially), To Kill a Mockingbird was excellent, and I absolutely loved Les Mis, just to name a few.  This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished.  Almost like Steinbeck got the idea in his head and then half-way through developed writer's block.  It was a pretty good story, but it just didn't have that deeper kick to pull me in.
B000066NW0|4.0|*A breath of fresh air.  It may not be totally Punk, but you will be hard pressed to care when you hear her sound.  This album is a nice fusion of pop, punk, and rock with some electronic thrown in for good measure.  Avril has produced a powerful set of songs and she will go far if she keeps this kind of quality in the future. She has a great voice that will make you want to &quot;Let Go&quot; more often. *A strong debut reminiscent of Fiona Apple standards.  *Listen to the samples and you will be hooked.
0316666343|5.0|This well-crafted, tightly written story deals with a terrifying subject -- child rape and murder -- without the gratuitous gore that stains the plots of so many other \\"serial killer\\" tales. The clever use of the protagonist's omniscient voice paints the plot in strokes that are both broad and minute, and each set piece is entirely believable. The murdered Susie views the actions, emotions and thoughts of her devoted father, her remote mother, her comical and alcoholic grandmother, her beloved siblings and even her deranged killer, showing us how they react to the end of her life on earth as THEY know it. Though Susie's in heaven, she continues to grow spiritually...an interesting observation and a point I've often pondered on myself. I loved this book and thank the author for bringing the story to life.
B000066NW0|3.0|Upon first listen of this debut CD from 17 year old, Canadian born Lavigne, you immediatley think 'Alanis Morissette Lite For The Teen Set'. You wouldn't necessarily be far off. However, once you listen to it again, you begin to hear that she is much more talented to be written off as an 'Alanis' knock off. She is much better than that. Some of the lyrics might be a little flimsy here and there, but that doesn't ruin what is a pretty fun and surprisingly good listen. Her first single, the smash hit \\"Complicated\\", tells you right from the start that this is no Britney or Mandy. It's a pop song, sure, but a good one with a rock and roll edge to it. The follow up single, the funky spelled \\"Sk8er Boi\\", is even better. Again, like the previous song, it could be dismissed as a pleasant pop song. Lavigne gives the song more attitude and spunk and makes it go higher than just a pop song. The rest can be said for the rest of the album. While there wasn't another song on the whole CD that has the appeal and hitmaking sound of the previous two, they are all well done and delivered songs. The opening track, \\"Losing Grip\\", is the one that comes the closest to being a repeat listen like the other two. I've mentioned Alanis a few times now, and I'm gonna do it again. There are numerous moments throughout the CD where you think Avril is channeling Ms. Morissette. Her Canadian accent is evident on several songs. Things slow down on two nice songs. One is called \\"I'm With You\\", and the other is called \\"Tomorrow\\". While the songs are nice and she shows a different vocal style, her voice still needs to develop. It is pleasant enough, but the songs are prettier than her voice itself. Give it time. The CD would of been better if some of the songs didn't seem similar to each other. The last half seemed very reminiscent of what we have already heard a minute earlier. I won't deny the girl her talent. She has a passable voice that will no doubt get better. She knows a riff and a catch, andshe is a fine lyricist. Again, like her voice, the writing will get better when she gets older. Plus, she plays guitar!. I like this new breed of pop artists. The 'Anti Britney's'. Lavigne is joining that group along with Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton. As I titled my review, it's a breath of fresh air. But, if you look at the excruciatingly ridiculous one star reviews, you realize that there will always be somebody who is ready to attack. Attack with meaningless drivel that the only purpose for it is for the reviewer's satisfaction. Everyone has an opinion, but some people are just in it for the cruelty.The CD is fun and entertaining enough, but it hints at better things to come from this talented artist in the future.
B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day\\" is entertaing,grim,and humourous.Mostly all at the same time.Although director Antoine Fuqua's direction style can be a little stylish and music video-ish at times(Fuqua started out helming music videos) that doesn't ruin \\"Training Day\\" at all.The acting is over the top.Denzel Washington seems peversely tickled while playing the twisted,streetwise bad crooked cop Alonzo Harris.And Ethan Hawke's Jake Hoyt is played with a boyish innocence and adult knowingness.Also featured are Tom Bergenen,Dr. Dre,Snoop Dogg,Macy Gray(as the hilarious \\"Sandman's Wife\\"),and .The hard-hitting hip hop soundtrack suits the film well.And the movie never really lags in terms of plot(although it might confuse you in one or two spots).<br />Basically \\"TD\\"'s plot consists of Hoyt's first day of training to be a narc cop.Hoyt's trainer is veteran Harris.Harris is a part of the drug and gang culture that he's supposed to be stopping.Harris' unconventional police tatics and dubious charm rub the naive Hoyt the wrong way.And it ends rather suprisingly.<BR>Yeah my summary may be flimsy but it wouldn't be right if I gave away the plot boilers and ending,would it? :-) <br />To me \\"Training Day\\" was just a highly entertaining dark comedy.<BR>I thought it was hilarious for the most part.But then again I found \\"Baby Boy\\" to be a laugh riot so I maybe I shouldn't speak on that!(LOL) The movie DID give me a glimpse of the world of the many cops who get caught up in the game in some of America's toughest 'inner cities'.That was intriguing since you hear so much about the media.This film will open a lot of eyes,which it's meant to do.But it's not flawless...As expected by any film that focuses on African Americans or Hispanics(or any ethnicity of color) OR urban suitations,\\"Training Day\\" is not without it's share of sterotypes.I'm sure Latinos are getting tired of seeing yet more Latino gangsters in chinos and tank tops spewing out \\"Ese\\" and threating to kill someone.And all of the urbanites in this film seemed to be malicious in some way.The film didn't bother to explore the 'good' people in these environments that are stuck in the shuffle or the vurnabilities of Alonzo.And the script seems weaker in terms of dialouge in certain parts.<br />But that's not enough to turn your back on \\"Training Day\\".This is a hard hitting,eye-glueing film experience.Unlike other cop dramas/\\"urban\\" action-dramas,\\"Training Day\\" has a strong morality message as witnessed at the ending.Although it should be forewarned that this movie is ultra-violent and why the individual whom I viewed this film with let their young,under-12 children  watch this hyperviolent/profainity filled film is beyond me(And this same person made an effort to rid these same children of cable television of violent video games...).<br />Anyhow,Denzel deserves props yet again for moving in a new direction with this VERY non-good man role.Many actors at his level wouldn't have taken that step.<br />YOU will surely have your own opinion on \\"Training Day\\" but one thing is for sure you sure won't be bored.
B000059POY|2.0|\\"This film business is very rude and cruel. If you are a weak person, it can destroy your mental.\\" Ewa Aulin<BR>             <br /> You got that right, sister.<BR> <BR> \\"Citizen Kane\\" finally made it to DVD. Who cares? So has \\"Candy\\"! <br /> To humiliate its \\"star,\\", Ewa Aulin, all over again. Anchor Bay's release of the 1969 film has lovely picture qualities. The colors are bright. The look of the film has been preserved and enhanced beautifully. There is depth of image. The film is garbage, but it looks great. It about destroyed my mental.<br />  I didn't take drugs in those groovy cool times.  This is why. Because I would have conjured up something like this endless bag of hot gas. With this movie,  I wanted nostalgia. I should have stuck a fork in my eye instead. Which, come to think of it, this is. \\"Candy\\" is based on the novel by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg (just who was Mason Hoffenberg anyway?) which was a satirical, satyrical (it's the level we're on here) retelling of \\"Candide.\\" Yeah, sure. That gave us an<BR>excuse to read it in the Student Lounge and on the quad and to pretend we were culturally mature.<br /> HA! If our dorm room walls could have talked. \\"Candy\\"--the novel is--hot. Better even than \\"The Hand Reared Boy.\\" Candide, Flandide, who cares? I circled the good parts in my copy with my pen. There were a lot of them.<br /> The movie, which I had never seen till this DVD, has no good parts to circle. Ewa Aulin was terrifically beautiful. She's got the stupid kewpie doll thing down pat. The second grade leer of the male lechers and the film makers is all here. STARS want to \\"deflower\\" her.  Tiresomely.<br /> Charles Aznavour is a hunchback who crawls on walls and the ceiling, and he flies!!  James Coburn is a mad mad cap doctor who performs bloody brain surgery to a theatre crowd, and knows the difference between a human and a spider monkey--which is apparently what Aznavour portrays. <br /> Marlon Brando is a guru with a far out wig and a dot on the forehead. He sits cross legged, and blithers, in his hippie dippie world in the back of a truck, with lots of neat psychedelic wall hangings,  then, tumbles with our heroine, and blithers, as only Marlon can. Richard Burton is, well, Richard Burton, and he is truly funny in wonderful self parody. Walter Matthau is a mad quasi-military yoo hoo--and also is excellent.<br /> We've got wanna be fragments of: comedy, a bit of camp horror, an attempt at surrealism, an attempt at a fantasy, an attempt at knocking the Establishment (that made this movie incidentally)and those who did the knocking, or pretend they did.<br />And a lot of irritating rock music of the time that reminds me why I hated most rock music of the time. Mostly we've got a stuffed turkey dead duck flailing around that tries to be everything the sixties was supposed to be over the place. Barbarella Psychedella--come home. All is forgiven.<br /> The BIOS on the disc list the various crash and burns the film caused. Including the start of Brando's downward spiral. So that's a good thing. <br /> But we don't see Ewa good and naked, and that's just cruel. I almost cried. Just close ups of parts of her, and a silhouette. They probably used a body double.  There are some funny shrewd lines. And a few neat put downs. Mostly though it labors. The limp love-in at the film's end nails the coffin tight. \\"Candy\\" is of course stupid beyond all<BR>measure. It wrecked careers. Embittered Ewa. It did the true deflowering of Candy Christian.<br /> But it would have been worth it for one crummy four second nude scene of her. \\"Myra Breckinridge\\" will be on DVD soon-- I just know it. Will I buy it? Of course. I'm something of a spider monkey myself.<br /> I can't help being happy I  finally saw \\"Candy.\\" But-- I think I'll go get a haircut now.
B000059XUO|5.0|From the  first moments of the opening scene, it becomes apparent that this is not the average film.  The Crow is an amazing feat of story telling that is at the same time disturbing and mesmerizing. Since seeing this movie for the first time, every other movie has been a let down.  Saturated in Drama, Terror, Suspense and some moments of Humor, The Crow is the best of it's and any other genre(except maybe that of kids movies) I have seen this movie at least a hundred times, and I'd see it a hundred more.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I thought Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels was one of the best outrageously wild comedies I'd ever seen until I saw Snatch.  Following the same movie genre as Lock Stock, (which is very Pulp Fictionesque), and bringing back a majority of the raucious cast of characters, Snatch hits a home run and really rates 10 stars on my scale of 1 to 5.  The story goes from about 0 to 100 in about 4.7 seconds, which means it's bit complecated to explain, but not hard to follow.  Most of the story takes place in London so be warned the thick and heavy English diologue may confuse you at times, but that's what subtitles are for. Either way it's a fun and energetic movie that casts Brad Pitt as a Gypsie Irishman only your subtitles can understand. With characters like Bullit Tooth Tony, Bricktop and Boris the Bullit Dodger, you know your in for a wild ride.<br />On a different note be sure to buy this version and not the Superbit. As Iv'e noticed with most Superbit DVDs the level of detail you gain pales in comparison to the special features you lose. Finally, get the soundtrack as well, you'll love it.
B0000046X0|4.0|I was disappointed when Bill Conners left R.T.F.His sound gave<BR>R.T.F an edge and defined fusion guitar.Listen to Chick Corea<BR>and Bill lock horns on \\"The Game Maker\\", with Stanley Clark <BR>thundering up the bass and Lenny White tearing his drum kit <BR>apart. The song is great.You can also hear Bill Connors on<BR>Stanley Clarke's solo release, circa 1974, with the late great<BR>Tony Williams on drums and Jan Hammer on keyboards.Bill Conners was<BR>THE man.
B00004ZSB6|5.0|Well what can I say, it's by far the best album since Flick of the switch. From the loud riffs to the even louder solos, it shows that even though they are getting on a bit they still rock better than all this so called rock today.ROCK ON!
0812550706|5.0|Our family chose Ender's Game for one of our summer meetings. My son wrote the following mini-review:<br />Taken from his home on Earth, Ender Wiggin is shuttled off to battle school, where young boys and occasionally girls are taught the ways of warriors and trained to fight in the war between humans and buggers. The children are separated into armies and thrown into mock battles in a special room in which they become weightless.<br />Ender swiftly moves through the ranks and soon leads an army of his own. Only later does he learn that the commanders of the school are training him to lead the humans to victory during the Third Invasion.<br />What I thought was going to be an &quot;easy&quot; Star Wars type of book was actually a book that turned me into an upright, wide-eyed, page-turning mad man; Ender's Game could not be left untouched for long.<br />My favorite scenes took place in the battle room. I wondered, What new tactics will Ender come up with this time? And the ending! Wow, was that a shock... for Ender and the reader.<br />JFS
B000000993|5.0|This is far and away Tool's best offering to date (including Lateralus). This is a raw and powerful piece of work that plain ol' kicks your ... Intolerance is my personal favorite and its the opening number. The album is well produced but not overproduced like Lateralus can be...dont get me wrong, I am a fan of all thier work but this is a classic. Crawling Away and Undertow are great songs, showcasing what this band is all about...raw power, explosive percussion and brain splitting bass guitar. <BR>All four of the members of Tool are masters of their trade. Maynard has an amazingly emotive voice that can raise the hair on the back of your neck at times and yet soothe you others.<BR>This album is however not slow or melow, it is race through the human mind and emotion that will take you to some dark places you won't talk about at parties via Maynards superbly insightfull lyrics.<BR>Bottom line...if you like heavy metal (hard rock) and love the sound of a pounding bass guitar like I do then you need this album.
B00005NWRS|1.0|Whiskeytown's Faithless Street introduced me to the amazing singer songwriter that was Ryan Adams. I wore out that album, taking in the aching harmonies, the fearless rockers, the liquor-dripping ballads -- I ate it up.<br />Gold left me baffled. Where did Ryan Adams I knew go?<br />I've done my best to let this album grow on me, but it just won't take. The Faithless Street spark isn't there, in my opinion. This album feels eerily calculated.<br />Faithless Street fans looking to catch up with Mr. Adams should proceed with caution. His focus seems to have shifted a bit.
6302439566|1.0|Wow! Here it is. Very likely the worst movie I have ever seen. I had read about this film ages ago but never seen it. What was going on (if anything) in the minds of the people involved? This must be the movie which inspired &quot;Showgirls&quot;. I thought that was the worst piece of doodoo until I watched this. No wonder so many actors' careers seemed to end with this one. I finally understand he meaning of &quot;bad taste&quot;. Phew - quel stinko
0380789019|3.0|This was my first Gaiman book.  I thought the storyline was relatively original (although I detected quite a few hints of Lord of the Rings and other sci-fi and fantasy novels I've read over the years mixed in) and the characters were clever.  However, my catalyst for reading this book in the first place were the slews of positive reviews of it on Amazon.  I'm not really sure what I missed, but I didn't deem it worth 5 let alone 4 stars; there are many other books in the same genre much more deserving of being read.  <br />I also found this book relatively difficult to read--the writing was often laborious and \\"jittery\\".  I found myself putting the book down more often than not.  At any rate, I think this was a good attempt at a fantasy-type novel set in the confines of a modern\\"ish\\" world.  But all in all, I think Mr. Gaiman should stick to comic books.
0380977788|5.0|Even buttons can be creepy. That's one of the things readers will learn when they flip open \\"Coraline,\\" the latest from author Neil Gaiman (the \\"Sandman\\" comics; \\"American Gods,\\" to name a few). <br />\\"Coraline\\" is like an even more bent and twisted version of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" There's no Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter or bottles that say \\"Drink me,\\" but the classic young-girl-finds-bizarre-danger-in-a-strange-new-world plot is still readily apparent. <br />Coraline and her parents, who ignore her, move into a new apartment. She soon goes exploring. After meeting the wacky upstairs neighbors - two gossipy old maids and an elderly gent who talks to rats - Coraline finds the door in her own place that opens into a simple brick wall. Or does it? <br />The door also opens into a creepy other realm, where strange doll-like versions of her parents have buttons for eyes and vow to never neglect her like her real parents have. The attention is sort of nice at first, but what happens when Coraline wants to go home? <br />Coraline finds assistance, if not alliance, in a smart-aleck black cat, whom she can only talk with in the other realm. <br />And the old man's rats are apparently continually discussing her adventures, providing a commentary on the action and Coraline's safety, although they never are seen by the audience. (We only get the heads up from the old guy himself, which goes to show what kind of a weird and quirky novel \\"Coraline\\" is.) <br />There's not too much to the plot, and even less that can be revealed lest we give it all away, but \\"Coraline\\" is fun, pure and simple. It's \\"Wonderland\\" gone even darker. <br />Told in the same amiable tone that made \\"Gods\\" (in which the worshiped deities of old found themselves doing battle with the new gods of technology) such a fun read, Gaiman has put together a fabulously creepy tale that teeters on the verge of childhood and adulthood. It's one more successful addition to a rapidly increasing list of impressive accomplishments.
0380820846|5.0|Excellent...This book is the best of the series.

B000069HKH|5.0|I've always enjoyed Bruce Springsteen's music, but I wouldn't consider myself a fan.  After many recommendations to purchase this cd I did, and I love it.  Springsteen tactfully captures the feeling of many Americans after 9/11.  If &quot;You're Missing&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; can't raise an emotion in you, your heart is stone.  This is a great cd for a dimly lit room, a glass of wine, and an hour's worth of contemplation.  Note that Brendan O'Brien produced this cd.  I've always fealt that he was resposible for much of Pearl Jam's early success.  Enjoy!
0060926317|1.0|Mutant Message Down Under, by Marlo Morgan is a book of non-entertaining fiction.  First of all, it is not a factual book, and probably not even based on some factual events, because then it would have been classified as non-fiction, or realistic fiction.  If you observe the rear cover you will notice the genre the book is given is \\"fiction.\\"  Meaning that this book is neither factual nor derived from factual events.  As reader628 stated earlier, there is no human way that a group such as this could communicate telepathically.  Marlo Morgan notes that the reason she was told of(that they could communicate this way) was because they \\"had nothing to hide.\\"  This is a sorry excuse for a sorry piece of writing.  Also, If Ms. Morgan was really walking around the hot, waterless Australian outback, without any form of protection from the sun, She would have skin cancer.  This so-called \\"book\\" is a horrendous excuse of writing that should not be read by any type of realistic reader.  Thank You, You've been great, Enjoy!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|It's apparent to me that Radiohead litened to &quot;The Notwist&quot;, as well as many other Warp Records. In fact, York has said at one time he had gone through the entire Warp Records' catalog. The Kid A &quot;sound&quot; is on The Notwist's album &quot;Shrink&quot; two years before it's release. Does this take away from Kid A? No. Not at all. It's just that The Notwist deserves your attention and respect. Kid A (Radiohead) = Neon Golden (The Notwist), Amnesiac(Radiohead)= Shrink (The Notwist): If you have one in your catalog you should check out the other, respectively.<br />So, you either get &quot;Kid A&quot; or you don't. You either love it or you hate it. No matter which &quot;sound&quot; of the fence you are on, &quot;Kid A&quot; will make an impact on you in some way. With an opening track like a Sci-Fi film &quot;Everthing In It's Right Place&quot; feels like aliens communicating with pipe organs. Then we are left, minds eased from uplifting sighs, to rocket into the calm, cool regions of black space. After the rockets exhaust, we float in a lone orbit on &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;. An organ and harp brings us back to earth on the coda &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, As York sings, &quot;I think You're Crazy&quot;.  Excalty what we are feeling at the moment we are hearing the end of this masterpeice. The track ends with the lines &quot;I will see you in the next life.&quot; We can only hope, as we feel we have been there and back.<br />Radiohead has to be the greatist band alive, if not the best since, well, you know. Breathing humans made this record! And with every listen I try and prove that impossible.
1577311523|5.0|Spiritual enlightenment is one thing, and how to recieve it is another. The Power of Now is highly educating which brings strong reasoning and is not so difficult to apply if you so wish. Whether you agree with anything in the book or not, the premise will leave you rethinking for the better especially for personal advancement, no matter what your faith is. Indeed we need to be constantly educated and enlightened, Tolle has certainly done this at a minimum. A book I strongly suggest exploring which opens up a cache of understanding and spiritual enlightenment is SB: 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox
0783226128|5.0|Has anyone noticed how funny this movie is? From the sanitation/sanitarium mixup to Tony's first turn on the dance floor to his bathtub of Olympic proportions to the immortal \\"Say hello to my leetle friend,\\" the script (by Oliver Stone) is a riot. The question is, Is it SUPPOSED to be a riot? I have to think yes.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Why does Hollywood romanticize war?? Pearl Harbor was a time of shock and horror. But yet, Hollywood turns it into a romantic movie. I was very disappointed with the movie because of this.  Hollywood failed in my eyes to show how America failed to take Japan seriously, especially when valuable information was intercepted. If they did, I must of selpt through it. Instead, Hollywood chose to show 2 guys in love with the same girl. Both guys go to war. At the end of the movie, guy #2 wins her heart.  <BR>The attack scenes were very realistic. I'm surprise Hollywood didn't add more romance during the scenes!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is my first Flaming Lips CD.  I will be looking for others soon.<br />My first listen was a bit underwhelming.  Seemed like a few nice tunes mixed in with some strange stuff.  I'm all for experimentation, but The Flaming Lips seemed to go beyond what I'm willing to listen to, especially the songs regarding battling the pink robots.<br />Since that first listen, I've hardly been listening to anything else.  The strange songs have grown on me, and the more &quot;normal&quot; songs have a grand beauty to them that I find captivating.  I think it is because this CD is filled with just the right amount of bizarre electronica to complement its &quot;mainstream&quot; elements to keep everything interesting listen after listen.<br />I don't know if anyone else would agree with me, but I've been telling friends that this CD is like a cross between John Lennon and Yes.  (And since my wife came in while listening to it and asked if I was listening to John Lennon, then I must have that similarity pretty close.)  Coyne's voice could easily pass for Lennon's on some of the dreamier songs, and many of the songs are filled with driving rock electronica, not too different from Yes's rock fusion sound.<br />If you are interested in trying something that's not mainstream rock/pop, and yet ultimately listenable, I recommend you try this CD.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I am a huge mystery buff.  I love the twist an turns.  The more twist and turns, the merrier.  This movie took too long to set up the characters. By the time you knew whos who, youd know theres a someone who needs a job desperately, a hunt (American Style), then theres a scene where they actually go hunting (big deal), dinner (oh hum), a little extra circular activity, then a murder and the movie is over. The so-called investigators were Laurel & Hardy England, I mean Britain style. Why they were added into the movie is beyond me.  If there was an investigation, will someone please tell me!!   <BR>I dont have a problem that someone else figured it out who done it and why, it just that the movie was took too long to get there, and if, if the Laurel & Hardy investigators DID any type of investigation, the director FAILED to show this.  Other than that, the scenery was beautiful. <BR>If you plan to rent or buy  DONT.  Its waste of money.  The movie did not rate the acclaim given. Its too bad the video store where I bought mine will not take it back, I dont blame them.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first heard Don't Know Why over the radio - the distinctive voice of Norah Jones just stuck in my mind.  After a couple of times later, I just needed to find out more about this singer.<br />Her renditions of vocals are excellent. She lends a unique feel to songs, not the typical jazz singer.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the best fiction books I have read in years.  Alice Sebold captures the reader's attention from the second sentence, &quot;I was 14 when I died,&quot; and never lets go.  The story is intruiging, a new twist on an old plot.  As you watch Suzie watching her loved one's lives from heaven, you feel all her emotions.  The entire time, one thought races through your mind...what will happen next?  When will the pain for everyone end?  Only to find out maybe it never does, which is the essence of this novel.  One of the most touching scenes in when Suzie's dog, Holliday, joins her in heaven, and even those with the shakiest of faiths will be moved.  I started this book on Wednesday at 6:00 pm and was finished with it by 10 am Friday.  A must read for anyone.
B000063K2W|5.0|No men appear in this movie, but men are the theme throughout.  With an all-star cast from 1939, including Joan Crawford in an unlikely but stunning role, \\"The Women\\" is a treat for female viewers of all ages.  Claire Booth Luce wrote this gossipy, powder-room romp about \\"l'amour, l'amour.\\"  Besides the escapades and heartbreaks of society women there are some great scenes in the kitchen featuring the servants, and on the Reno divorce ranch featuring Lucy, a tough old customer played by Marjorie Main.<br /><br />  Depression-era audiences lapped up the scenes of New York City opulence, and the movie comes complete with some characters using the British-inflected accents that stood for wealth and class in movies from that time.<br />  Recommended for laughs and a girls' night in at the movies!
B00005NGSE|5.0|I originally bought this as a two cd set back in the late 80's. For 2001 the entire performance is on a single cd and has been remastered for improved sound. This classic live performance by The Scorpions includes all their hits from their RCA years such as &quot;Speedy's Coming&quot;, &quot;Pictured Life&quot;, &quot;Steamrock Fever&quot;, &quot;In Trance&quot;,etc. plus a song from their &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; album.  Also, you get their renditions of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and a Japanese song called &quot;Kojo No Tsuki&quot;. The group sounds identical to their studio work and both vocalist Klause Meine and guitarist Ulrich Roth sound fantastic. Roth's guitar playing is especially impressive with the unique sound he creates. The only song missing from the original &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot; is &quot;Polar Nights&quot; which is available on the &quot;Taken By Force&quot; remastered cd as a bonus track. This live cd ranks right up their with UFO's &quot;Stranger's In The Night&quot; and Pat Traver's &quot;Live... Go For What You Know&quot; cd's. Highly recommended.
B00000811N|3.0|This was created for a British TV special about the body. It is the background music used in the show, kind of like what was done for the US TV show, Hot Dog.  Only the music in Hot Dog was much more interesting.  The CD is 42 minutes long.<br />This disk starts out with wierd and gross noises from bodily functions.  It reminds of the noises that the guy in the next cubicle makes during lunch.  It is then just basically background music, with a two vocal tracks.  <br />I am giving this 3 stars because there are a few interesting tracks, especially near the end.  With a CD burner you could rip about 10 minutes of fairly nice music...maybe this is only 2 stars....but even Pink Floyd members at their worst make better music then a lot of other \\"artists\\".  And in some ways, the music is a little better and more melodic than Radio Waves.<br />Before getting this album, you first look into Water's Amused to Death, either of Gilmore's solo albums, Wright's Wet Dreams or Nick Mason's jazz album (I forget the title).  Also go for Zabriskie Point, although it is a little expensive.
0792839730|5.0|Simply put, this movie was great and very very accurate. A captain actually was shot in the head, the sgt after getting just as seen in the movie did point a gun at a doctor to get the captain looked at and the captain lived. This was simply a great movie. One historical comment. British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. You were and still are the most CONCEITED, STUCK UP, and INCOMPETENT commander of all time. You weren't fit to command a platoon. You cost many good soldiers their lifes because you wanted glory. In both the movie and historically \\"Monty\\" ignores the warnings of two understrength SS panzer divisions being in the Arnhem region to re-fit. This proved to be a critical blunder.
B00005JKL8|4.0|If you are looking for a realistic war movie then you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for some escapist patriotic entertaiment then Behind Enemy Lines is may be what you are looking for. What made this movie more apealing was during the time of it's release, when many Americans just needed to be away from the real world for a couple hours.<br />The story takes place in the Balkans where a routine recon flight is taking place. The pilot and his \\"Wizzo\\" (weapons intelligents officer) decided to investigate some activity in the no fly zone. To their horror they are shot down and now the Wizzo (Owen Wilson) must track through hostile territory to reach a safe zone where he can be rescued. The film does however belittle the American Allies (the French) which may irritate non-American viewers. But the film is alot of fun to watch. Rent it, but I would not recommend purchasing it unless if you are into action films
B00005R1N3|4.0|***Contains Minor Spoilers***<BR>The third of director Bob Clark's three horror movie's he directed in the 70's(Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things & Deathdream aka The Night Andy Came Home) and one of the best slasher's ever made.  In my opinion Deathdream is slightly better but Black Christmas is right next to it.  While a lot of people compare this with Halloween the two are like night and day.  Clark brings a feeling of dead so thick you can cut through it with a knife.  While Michael Myers is thouroughly explain in Halloween the killer is Black Christmas is a total mystery.  Who is he? Where did he come from?  While Myers never talked here the killer expains in phone calls to the victims how completely crazy he is.  Most people don't get the ending but remember the phone rings after each murder.<BR>The extras are nothing to speak of: a short interview with John Saxton, short filmographies of the main players, & a very good film trailer.  The remastering is very good, I noticed very little grain and excellent sound(something extreamly important in this type of movie).
B00006HBUA|5.0|My husband and I took our 2 year old to the theater, and it was packed as it was father's day. My 2 year old is obsessed with Scooby, and she loved the movie, I think almost all the kids in the theater that day did, I've never seen so many little kids glued to a movie like that, if your child loves Scooby Doo then they would probably like the movie. It has kind of a weird ending, but we'll see what the sequel turns out to be.

6305841861|4.0|It's almost a running gag how much blood gushes in this film.  Out of people, out of walls, out of sewer pipes, etc., etc.  There's some surprising touches of humanity to the performances - at one point a woman sings a childhood lullaby to her (possessed, undead) mother which gives Campbell time to chop her up.  The plots a little more logical than ED1. <br />As others have said, no horror collection is complete w/o the Evil Dead Series (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness).
B00006BTCA|5.0|Superbly cinematic in scope and feel.  Definitely carrying the Joy Division banner, but in no means hiding under it.  Stella Was A Diver moves to tears, I swear.
B00000G3Q4|3.0|When the unseen monster crashes into a bedroom and attacks a girl, the other characters, in the living room, glance up and STROLL to the bedroom to see what happened.  After having been attacked several times by undead monsters they split up to go to separate bedrooms to get some sleep - and even though they have fairly strong storm shutters on the windows, no one thinks to close and lock them so monsters come crashing through all the time.<br />The bonus extras on the DVD are decent.  There's running commentary, stills, and raw footage of some of the shoots.  The 5.1 Dolby remix improves the audio.<br />No horror film collection is complete w/o the Evil Dead Trilogy.  Though individually weak as a set they embody the spirit (pun intended) of 70's horror movie making.
0316666343|5.0|I don't get the nasty reviews I have read here at Amazon.com.  I think every important book critic liked the Lovely Bones.  A lot of news programs on TV liked it too.  People are obviously buying it and if this book were really bad, don't you think word of mouth would have killed it by now?  What, Harry Potter is fine because its for kids but the Lovely Bones is not because its for grown ups?  I think this book is fine for both.  What about this.  Don't you think the Lovely Bones is strange because it seems to be liked by respected critics AND the regular people on the street?  How often does that happen?  But my first visit to these review pages and man, I get the feeling this book is actually hated for being a success and for getting into a subject that people feel connected to in a simple way.  And that's why I like the Lovely Bones.  I can follow it and not have to re read pages that are filled with 1000 word sentences before you come to a period.  I don't feel like I have to be smart to get it.  I'm not going to apologize for liking it.  I think people who didn't like it read a lot more books then the rest of us and to be honest, the public doesn't care much about.  So they praise the others and attack this one.  The Lovely Bones is one of the few I can read easily while those who didn't like it are almost saying we were brainwashed and fooled.  Hey, nobody forced or theatened me to buy this book.  This is a book you can safely give as a gift.  Not of lot of dirty words and no, I don't think it was corny as people are saying it is.  It doesn't have the stuff that makes people hate books in the first place.  Most books I read are too hard to get through because they seem written not for me.  This book hits me because we have all lost someone and some of us have a tougher time dealing with what's left after someone you love a lot is gone.  The lovely bones is all made up and maybe the author didnt expect it to be popular, but it is because its wonderful.  A zillion people who bought this can't be wrong.  I can think of other books that were praised on TV or in newspapers and you know, I bet most of the same people who didn't like the Lovely Bones didn't like those either.  Hype, hype, hype.  People were tricked, they say.  My goodness, its like that super-smart guy two cubicles down from me.  He thinks all of America is going stupid.  And anything popular, from movies or books, can't be good.  This is a fine book.  I think its hard to write a book that can reach a lot of people.  You try to do it and still get important critics liking you.  If critics had that much power, especially the ones in the newspapers and not on TV, then every book would sell a zillion.  So please don't believe the negatives by others.  I'm sure most them have books on their shelves I haven't even heard of.
B00005A1PR|4.0|This is a new direction for me.  i rarely purchase music that I am not familiar with... but I always purchase the grammy nominee CD... and I fell in love with the first track... which happened to be this stunning new artist.  I was finally able to pick up the CD and have certainly not been disappointed.  Even for me, who am not a huge fan of R&amp;B... or anything else in particular.  I like what I like.  And this one has certainly found its way onto my list.<br />Spectacular.  A worthy addition for anyone who isn't musically  challenged.
0060392886|5.0|If you buy anything this is the book to buy. If you thought you knew everything about Motley Crue, you haven't heard nothing until you read this book. This book will keep you on your toes and shocked out of your mind!
B00005JL3A|5.0|I can't say I'm a huge fan of the hard to play game, but the movie version is AWSOME! Creepy with the perfect mix of gore. Mila Jovovich's preformance was absolutely first rate, with an extra dose of girl power! The movie is true to the style of the video game and the effects are marvelous!
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is perhaps the best WW II movie available. It's certainly the best one available about the war in the Atlantic and submarine warfare in WW II in general.<BR>What this movie does particularly well is accurately portray daily life aboard a German U Boat. Aside from the Eastern front after summer 1941, a German U Boat is the last place anybody really wanted to be. Of approx. 40,000 German submariners, approx. 30,000 didn't come home.<BR>Also, due to the fact that WW II and the Battle of the Atlantic began over 60 years ago, it's difficult for a lot of people, myself included to visualize how they did things then. Until I did some reading and then watched this movie, it never occured to me that most German U Boats spent much of their time topside and only submerged to shoot, escape after shooting or avoid being detected and killed. This is quite a contrast to what is portrayed with the navies of the world today where subs can go days or weeks without surfacing if they need to. It also made me realize how really primitive compared to today's technology that submarining was, particularly having to visually seek out your target and line it up, there was no radar or sonar aboard these boats. <BR>The movie also I think probably accurately portrayed the comraderie of the German crews, and how they probably complained about Hitler, Goering and Doenitz behind their backs while aboard ship and many really weren't die hard Nazis but there because they had to be. One also gets a very good understanding of the fear of being detected and trying to avoid depth charges after firing. <BR>This is an outstanding movie and should be watched by anyone wishing to gain an understanding about what the Battle of the Atlantic was like from the German perspective.
B00000258J|5.0|I don't have much to add to the previous reviews, but would like to mention the superb work of Charles Calmese on bass and Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith on drums.  It's easy to overlook their work amid the superb guitar-playing of Muddy, Johnny, and Bob Margolin, the piano of &quot;Pine Top&quot; Perkins, and of course, James Cotton's terrific harmonica, but is this pile-driving rhythm section that gives the album its &quot;hard&quot; sound.
0767800958|5.0|weaving reality into a subtrifuge of the story line which envelopes both the audience and the actors, sally potter gives us another glimmer of her incredible talent...read the main review for the storyline, but color it with the photographic brilliance of a play on modern cinema (e.g. the main story is b/w while the adverts for fashion (which are meant to be inconsequential) are displayed in fantastico colour)...the double binds are spellbinding as is the texture of the film...salute sally potter...bugger all the critiques!

0061040967|4.0|If you are a Pratchett fan, you must own this for the Kidby illustrations. I spent most of my time looking over  Leonard de Quirm's  notes and plans which were simply wonderful.<br />The fable line is a bit too fable-y for me and I read hoping it would have more of the  usual Pratchett humor and interest. It doesn't quite make it in that regard. It is still a good tale and worth the purchase. It is sort of an artistic  hissy fit spit about the nature of life and its end, heroes and artists and the singer and the song.  All well and good and have been addressed elsewhere but this will do in a pinch.  While I found the minstrel's last couple of pages moving (including the song remains ) the story itself never actually got me there- it was sort of an outside recognition of Pratchett and the nature of narrative.<br />But still a good read, the illustrations are fabulous and it's a nice building stone in the  Pratchett world. I would start with another  Discworld tale if you are new to the series, but this one deserves its place among the rest once you have read a few.
B00006690G|5.0|If you liked Eminem's first two albums, this one won't be a disappointment. There is a definite difference, however. This album shows much more of Eminem's emotion and perspective on life and less about drugs and violence. It gives a different view and a new understanding of Eminem and the things he has been through...I think that is why it is called \\"The Eminem Show\\". Some of the songs even gave me goosebumps the first time I heard them.<br />This is definitely another Eminem masterpiece...I hope there are many more to follow.
B000002UZ1|5.0|'Revolution 1'[White Album] was so slow,I was disapointed. Now 'Revolution'[1967-1970] is the song that will blow you away,it fits in the catagory of 'Crazy Train'[Ozzy Osbourne],'Us and them'[Pink Floyd],'Kasmir'[Led Zepplin],and other '80's classics. This was a song ahead of its time. A true master piece.
B000000JO3|5.0|Its very unusual for a band to be entirely encapsulated by one album. Minor Threat's \\"Complete Discography\\" does just that. This band was so different from everything being played around them that they were hated by many punk fans and almost all punk bands. Their straight edge message has now earned them the respect of all their peers. None of the \\"pseudo-punk\\" bands that are so popular now (Blink-182, Sum 41) can hold a candle to Minor Threat, yet they are all deeply indebted to them.<br /><br /> The album assaults you from the very beginning. You have to sit down with the lyric book to grasp what Ian MacKaye is saying. But when you do, you are rewarded with some of the most intelligent and poignant messages any punk band ever threw out to their audiences.<br /><br /> The great thing about \\"Complete Discography\\" is that you can see the growth of this band. They started out with almost entirely three-chord punk anthems (\\"Minor Threat\\" and \\"12XU\\") and progressed to more complex songs (\\"No Reason\\" and \\"Look Back and Laugh\\"). They even invented a catchy phrase at the very end of \\"Sob Story.\\" (Amazon.com's guidelines don't allow me to reveal it here, but you'll know it when you hear it)<br /><br /> Every time I listen to \\"Salad Days,\\" the last song on this album and the last song Minor Threat ever recorded together, I get nostalgic. I'll always remember where I was when I first heard this album. I've owned this CD for a long time, and I'll never get sick of it.<br /><br /> A necessity for any punk fan.
B000002KJQ|5.0|ZZ Top goes with Texas like Tequila goes with a Margarita.  If you like how they sound around home drive down to Texas and listen to them.  Drive from the north through Dallas at daybreak on a Saturday.  Put in this tape or CD whichever, and feel the music breathe on you.  &quot;Sheik&quot;, &quot;LaGrange&quot;, &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot;, etc... at this time nothing, I mean nothing, sounds better.  By the time you make it to Austin, if not sooner, ZZ Top has become one of your favorite groups if they weren't already.
B00003CY0U|4.0|This techno-thriller kicks off with one of the most exciting movie openings ever. And rest assured, there is plenty more action to follow. John Travolta is on top form as Gabriel, a government agent turned arch thief plotting a heist to the tune of $9.5 billion from a top-secret government stash. He's aided in his devious efforts by his glamorous assistant Ginger (Halle Berry) and Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman), a well-known computer hacker. Meanwhile, Vinne Jones enhances his Hollywood reputation by playing a physic hitman-what else?<br /> All in all, it's a slickly-made action movie that's drenched in testosterone. And although the plot gets a bit obscure at times, there are plenty of big bangs and some decent acting too- and you can't say fairer than that.
B000069I5W|4.0|\\"Showtime\\" is a fun comedy starring two movie stars who I never thought I would see paired: Eddie Murphy and Robert Deniro.<br />They made a great pair and a good chemistry working together as two cops who are on a reality t.v. show (think: cops & big brother mixed together). Deniro's character, Mitch Preston, wants nothing to do with it, and Murphy's character, Trey Sellars, is an actor as well as police officer, is pysched to be working as an actor. Even thought their characters don't really have much in common, they somehow seem to blend well together and balance each other out.<br />Mitch is divorced and spends much of his spare time doing pottery, this does little to add to the plot, but is more of a sideline.<br />Trey is a quick talking, \\"dumb\\" cop type, who is trying really hard to be an actor along side his career as an officer of the law.<br />Rene Russo is the only other name in this snappy little comedy. She plays Chase Renzi, a pushy t.v. journalist who wants to use Trey and Mitch to her advantage to get ratings.  Not her usual kind of role, she pulls it off anyway. She does a great job in<br />her supporting role.<br />This was a genuinely good comedy, and I really liked it. I laughed a lot!!!! It was really funny.<br />Even though it is somewhat predictable, it is also a very entertaining film. There are some good performances here, and I think Murphy and Deniro were great together.<br />Highly recommend this one for fans of comedy genre, but especially fans of Deniro and Murphy<br />Eileen Famiglietti
B00003CXXR|4.0|When you're watching a movie about dinosaurs you want everything to be big! Big reptiles, big special effects and big frights. The latest instalment in the Jurassic Park series delivers that and more. Sam Neill, reprising his role as the grizzled Dr. Alan Grant, is now working as a palaeontologist, and has vowed never to have anything to do with live dinos again. But when a 14 year old boy goes missing on the island, he finds himself persuaded to help in the search and-taking his assistant (rising star Alessandro Nivola) and some mercenaries -sets off in a chartered plane.<br /> Unfortunately, the plane crashes and the group becomes stranded. The rest of the movie becomes a race to see who will get off the island and who will become lunch for any number of big, bad reptiles. The plot is largely secondary however- the dinosaurs are the stars of this show, and the boy. Giving our plucky heroes most trouble are of course the Veliciraptors (who can now communicate-isn't evolution a wonderful thing?), although the tooth-baring Tyrannosaurus also proves to be a significant obstacle. Best of all, though, are the very scary Spinosaurus and the flying reptilian Pteranodons. Crammed with plenty of thrills, Jurassic Park 3 is loud, crashing monster movie fun.
B000069HKH|4.0|I had highly anticipated this album when I had heard of it's impending arrival. I have been a huge fan of The Boss> When the last studio album came out w/ the E street band was when I was really taken up by him and his stories told my music.<br />He is a totally amazing musician, an awesome performer( must be seen live at least once in your lifetime, he is worth the price of that high admission), and a great song writer.<br />\\"The Rising\\" is not only his and the E street bands latest endeavor, but it's his coming into a great maturity.  I definitely could hear it in his voice that he is getting older and mellowing a bit, but then when I saw him performing \\"Mary's Place\\" live, he really is still THE BOSS!<br />He wrote a lot of the songs as his response to the Sept. 11th attacks.  These are some very profound and emotionally charged lyrics.  Even if some of them are extremely repetitive, I just can't help but be lured in by Bruce's outpuring of serious emotion regarding these terrible tragedies.  That all aside, this is an amazing piece of work that should be purchased.<br />The album has ballads and faster songs (Let's be friends just gets me in a serious rocking mood.)<br />It's packed with songs! There is a lot of music here, and this is a record well worth buying for the fan that appreciates any and all of Bruce.  There isn't a single song that I didn't like. They all sounded good to me.<br />Bruce and the guys deserve great praise and admiration for this great piece of music. It may be long overdue, but it was worth the wait. NOw if we can just all get tickets to the concerts...<br />Highly recommending for all fans of Bruce! You huge fans, buy it! It has something for everybody that appreciates his music.<br />Eileen Famiglietti
B000024O2Q|5.0|This is the first thing I ever heard by Maiden . I quite hated it at first but as time passed I began to understand it better .<BR>One fine day I realised it was great . Tracks like The clairvoyant,the trooper,virus,man on the edge,fear of  the dark,hallowed be thy name ,aces high,be quick or be dead,the evil that men do certainly deserved to be here .They are all masterpieces. I dont know how Bring your Daughter to the slaughter ever got here . God knows what he's even talking about. That 's pretty much junk . So is running free . But that's excusable , being on thier first album. Otherwise its a great collection . Rime of the Ancient Mariner ought to have been here . so ought also  Wrathchild or Killers or powerslave.
B0000636UN|3.0|I still like it.<br />&quot;C'mon,C'mon&quot; is the most recent album from Sheryl Crow, one my all time favorite female rockers.<br />This album starts off with three very rocking songs, &quot;Steve Mcqueen&quot;, 'Soak up the Sun'(the first single and a true anthem for me as I totally relate to many of the lyrics.), and &quot;You're an Original&quot;. This song has a certain tune and melody.  I think it will be the next single off the album after the opener &quot;Steve Mcqueen&quot;. &quot;You're..&quot; is sung with none other than Don Henley, who has the perfect back up on this track.<br />The rest of the album is nothing too memorable for me to highly enforce listening to them. I think a lot of the songs sound too much alike. I like Sheryl's voice and the music she plays.  The big fans of Sheryl Crow maybe a little disappointed. I honestly don't think this is her best work. The first album, and the album titled &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; are her best work aside from live Crow.<br />She is a great singer and guitarist, I'll give her that.<br />I'm just gonna go soak up the sun, while it's still free....<br />(that is such a great song)<br />I'm on the fence here..It's recommended if you really really love Sheryl and can appreciate anything she does.<br />Otherwise, if you are buying this cuz You love &quot;soak up the sun&quot;, you are going to be disappointed.<br />Eileen Famiglietti
B00006G8G1|3.0|This is an outstanding DVD. I will watch it repeatedley im sure. but the vocals that i think really should be comming through the center do not all you get is a guitar that sounds like you are listening to a direct feed of his amp. you can barely even hear bruce even in DTS mode
B00005JKLZ|1.0|so that you can recapture the hour and a half that you will waste by viewing this terrible movie.<br />I was simply amazed at how bad this was. Usually movies this bad, can be good in their awfulness. Not this one.<BR>The acting was bearable, and probably the only saving grace of the flick, but is by no means rememerable (just good relative to everything else).<BR>The story had so many holes in it, I sat there and wondered if any of the makers actually watched their final product. 800,000 years of geologic change - yet panes of glass survive. An &quot;ancient&quot; language learned from signs and pieces of storefronts, that everyone seems to know. Why? Don't ask. You won't get an answer from watching.<BR>The characters are one-dimensional, at best, and the story gave no indication or reasoning behind anyone's actions.<BR>The special effects, which I was counting on 10 minutes into the film to be a saving grace, were sub par. So I get to see 5 seconds of the moon breaking up, gosh. Mechanical gears and sparks flying underground for no reason at all... yawn.<BR>Do yourself a favor and avoid this flick. Go rent Time Bandits or Time After Time to get your fix.
B00004XONN|3.0|Though it received plenty of rave reviews upon release, \\"Kid A\\" is more a good record than a great record.  It does have several moments of pop genius, such as the jazzy, bass-driven \\"The National Anthem\\" (excellent horns section) and the sparse, bass-and-drums \\"Idioteque,\\" but more often it drifts too much into left-field.  I wish Thom Yorke would have made his usually brilliant lyrics more discernable and less banal, since most of them here come out as nothing more than blurred sounds produced with little emotion or meaning--this is the album's primary shortcoming.  Though high on deconstructionist concept/message, in the end \\"Kid A\\" leaves the listener cold. It did indeed produce several classics, such as the two songs mentioned above as well as the haunting \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" but the album could easily have done without the hollow \\"Treefingers\\" or the let-down ending, \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\" I know that many consider those who liked \\"OK Computer\\" but rejected \\"Kid A\\" as sell-outs and non-believers, but \\"Kid A\\" is simply a flawed record that tries to disguise itself as a masterpiece.  And just because something is inaccessible and anti-radio does not mean that it is a great piece of art, as many would like to believe.  It's good for a few songs and a few listens, but \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" are much stronger works.
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is awesome. The heavy guitar riffs are perfect with Till Lindemann's vocals. Don't let not understanding the lyrics put you off this band. There are English versions in the album book, but they are not direct translations. I Highly reccommend any Rammstein.
B000068TPN|3.0|This is a just-watchable film that pushes no boundaries whatsoever. How those responsible could delude themselves into thinking that it was 'getting right' something that no other film had got right is beyond me. I thought Gibson's performance as Colonel Moore was fairly poor. I could imagine the words he was speaking being delivered with much more conviction and emotional impact than he was actually producing. This is probably because he was going out of his way to put on a fake American accent. It's very difficult to be able to put on a fake accent and ,at the same time, deliver lines with any emotional vigour. The first 40 minutes of the film, focusing on life in the base before the soldiers shipped out to Vietnam, were extraordinarily lame and plodding. It was Pearl Harbour all over again with its whiny emotionality and I was tempted to stop watching at this point. I soldiered on through it, however, and it definitely picked up when they got to Vietnam. It was still nothing special though and  continually reminded me of Pearl Harbour with its sub-Spielberg emotional striving.<BR>The film continues the noble Hollywood tradition of glorifying the 'No one gets left behind' shibboleth of the American armed forces. Satisfyingly, it breaks with tradition somewhat in killing some of those who try and fulfil this ludicrous pledge. Maybe if this is done a little more in the cinema people will wake up to the simple truth that it is not always a good idea to go back for a comrade. Nine times out of ten it will get both the comrade and his would-be rescuers killed.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This is Paul McCartney's most consistent and solid album, start to finish in ages!! Many of the tunes are very popy and catchy. The song that would have to be my favorite out of the whole album is really, &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, that is a very solid tune. <br />Other notable tracks include: &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot; (Featuring Eric Clapton), &amp; the ballad &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot;.
0316666343|2.0|I am an avid reader, and a librarian. Despite the rave reviews this book has received, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The opening paragraph is a grabber; and the concept is fascinating (murdered girl watching how her death has affected those around her). But the book just doesn't deliver. I too have lost a daughter, though not to murder, and found the family's reaction implausible. And Suzie's heaven does not seem to be such a beautiful or desirable place; why does she still have such longing to be back on Earth? Finally, Suzie's return to earth to make love to Ray; and the way in which Mr. Harvey gets his \\"just desserts\\" are beyond believable! NOT recommended!
B0000640VN|5.0|Admittedly the notion of time travel is not a new one to the cinema, but &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; puts a new spin on an old plot.  Very little of the film is devoted to the usual slap-stick comedy of the person displaced in time making &quot;hilarious&quot; mistakes about something-or-other.  Instead, the 19th-century Leopold (Duke of Albany) has little trouble getting by after his initial confusion; he even helps Kate's brother, the truly hilarious Charlie, pull his social life together, and his 19th century views on life turn out to be astonishingly relevent to 21st-century life.  Every actor in this movie is impressively compelling.  I very highly recommend this truly romantic-and-comedic romantic comedy!
0061020680|4.0|This fourth book in the Discworld series is the first to achieve truly classic status, in my opinion.  Its predecessors were great reads, but Mort is a real riot.  The skeleton of the plot has a few cracked bones and seems to be missing whatever connects the setup bone with the conclusion bone, but the humor is more than a saving grace for the awkward ending.  Poor Mort is a gangly, clumsy lad seemingly made out of all knees; his father is fond of him but decides to apprentice him to someone else.  That someone else turns out to be Death himself (although the father sees him as an undertaker).  Mort is whisked off to Death's abode to be trained as Death's apprentice.  On his first solo mission, he rips a big hole in the fabric of time by saving a princess from assassination.  Death is off trying to experience living, so Mort attempts to make things right with the help of Death's adopted daughter Ysabell (who has been sixteen for thirty five years already), the young wizard Cutwell, the princess, and--with great reluctance--Death's manservant Albert.<br />This is a riotously funny novel.  I can truly say that Death has never been funnier.  Being the reaper of souls for untold years does wear a guy down, and Death goes out into the real world to try and discover what life is all about.  We find him dancing in a kind of conga line at a party for the Patrician, asking the guy in front of him why dancing around and kicking things over is fun; we see him getting boozed up at a bar and telling his troubles to the bartender, we find him seeking employment and dealing with a normal human customer, and we ultimately find him happily serving as the cook at Harga's House of Ribs.  His questions and comments about human life are simple yet complex, and they basically mimic the same kinds of questions we all ask about the purpose of our time on earth.  I personally found the funniest scene to be one in which Death takes Mort to a restaurant just after hiring him and tries to figure out why on earth there is a cherry on a stick in his drink--as he keeps returning to this mental conundrum, the scene just gets funnier and funnier.<br />To some degree, this novel is a bit simplistic compared to later Pratchett writings, but it is a quick, enjoyable read guaranteed to make you laugh out loud at least once.  We get a glimpse of some new vistas of the Discworld, and more importantly we gain great understanding and familiarity with Death, his abode,  and his way of non-life.  The wizard Cutwell is a young, beardless wizard who keeps finding his devotion to wizardry (especially the whole bachelorhood requirement) tested by the beguiling femininity of the princess--his temptation-forced words and actions provide another great source of humor in the book.  The cast of important characters if fairly slim in number, but we do meet up with our old friends Rincewind and the librarian momentarily and learn a little more about Unseen University.  The ending definitely could have been better, and that is the main weakness of this particular novel.  Other Discworld novels will capture your imagination much more forcibly than this one, but few will make you laugh as hard as this one does.ure out why on earth there is a cherry on a stick in his drink--as he keeps returning to this mental conundrum, the scene just gets funnier and funnier.  <br />To some degree, this novel is a bit simplistic compared to later Pratchett writings, but it is a quick, enjoyable read guaranteed to make you laugh out loud at least once.

I do think it is for people with a brain and know how to use it.  AAHHHH fantasy concert: Talking Heads and the Clash.<br />YOWZA!  Enjoy for pure musical pleasure and judge for yourself.  The best.  Sandinista.  To hell with the critics.  Grammies for M. Jackson and not Elvis?  Critics.
0060930187|5.0|I read this book upon the recommendation of my best friend.  I am a teenager and like many of the other people who have written reviews for &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, I have suffered from depression.  When I was reading this book, I was surprised by how similar Esther's feelings were to my own.  Some reviews mention that they feel that her depression is not credible.  I on the other hand thought her depression felt real and justified, almost tanglible.  The bell jar is a perfect metaphor for how you can sometimes feel while afflicted with depression.  The detached feeling can be insufferable.  I thoroughly enjoyed, and was touched by this book.  It is definitely worth a read...
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This DVD was recommended as the best version available for this film. It is. There is an extra film \\"Day of Freedom\\" included, along with the most complete film exposure available via the windowbox process. Sound is good. Everything is clear. You can see the pattern in the eagle over the Nuremburg rally well, and you can see the expressions on the peoples faces even. The filmwork of Leni Reifenstahl must be seen to be believed--awesome. Hitler and Hess are seen with hair misplaced and sweating, etc.--emphasizing their reality and humanness. The film is old, but it still hits you with hurricane force right in the gut. Wow. Don't miss this one. It is a historical gem.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spiderman was one of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2002, which is a lot of baggage to carry when setting out to make an adaptation of one of the most popular comic strips ever.  However, with Sam Raimi safely entrusted with the responsibility of Directorial duty and the excellent casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, this movie always looked a sure-fire winner and indeed it is exactly that.<br />As everybody knows Spider-man's alter ego Peter Parker is that anonymous boy next door, the boy who never gets the girl and whom the girl doesn't even notice. He's as pure as the driven snow, devoted to his Aunt and Uncle, the boy for girls to take home to their mother, safe, kind but somewhat unexciting.  Bullied at school, he is the butt of everyone's jokes and regarded as something of a nerd, a bit of a loser. However, after being bitten by a genetically modified spider, Peter transforms overnight from anonymous boy next door to super hero in this good guys can come first comic-book tale.<br />There are so many good things about Spider-man it is hard to know where to start. First off, what I found most impressive and refreshing was the screenplay, which unlike most major Hollywood studio major event movies actually relies on narrative, plot and character development to tell the story instead of just loosely sewing together action scenes with meaningless dialogue (Simon West are you listening?). Credit for this should go to writer David Koepp and Director Sam Raimi for avoiding this obvious pitfall that has spoilt many a summer blockbuster (such as Tomb Raider to give but one example). Raimi's direction is sure-footed and subtle and the decision to give him megaphone duties has proven to be well vindicated. The casting of Tobey Maguire is another masterstroke because Tobey Maguire is undoubtedly one of the most talented young actors around with a CV of critically acclaimed performances in critically acclaimed movies, that seasoned veterans would be proud of, such as; Ride With The Devil, Pleasantville, The Ice Storm, The Wonder Boys and The Cider House Rules. With Mr Maguire as Peter Parker we get performance of depth and subtlety of a teenager struggling with more than the normal transformation from boy to man. Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous, The Virgin Suicides) is also a spectacular success with her girl next-door looks and range and depth of emotion and ability, as is Willem Dafoe (Platoon, Light Sleeper etc.) in the villainous role of the Green Goblin, carefully avoiding too much ham.<br />All that said there are some faults. For example, some of the web-slinging CGI is a disappointment and up close the green goblins headgear is a bit rubbish.  Spider-Man is also apparently (according to all the geeks) littered with continuity errors but much of that can perhaps be explained by the devastating happenings of September 11th and several scenes featuring the twin towers, including an apparently superb sequence with the villain's helicopter getting caught in webbing between the Twin Towers had to be cut, along with the relevant narrative. Plus the final scenes where a crowd of New Yorkers hurl objects at the Green Goblin has a definite tagged on feel to it but the who can blame them for it's addition is entirely appropriate and rightly captures the spirit of NYC in the aftermath of 9/11: \\"Ya take one of us on, ya take us all on!\\" shouts one patriotic New Yorker. Ending with our favourite web-slinger against the backdrop of the stars and stripes, Spider-Man is a resounding success and with Raimi, Maguire and Dunst all signed up for the sequel, I personally cant wait for Spider-Man 2.soned veterans would be proud of, such as; Ride With The Devil, Pleasantville, The Ice Storm, The Wonder Boys and The Cider House Rules.

B000W74EQC|2.0|One of the bestselling series of all time is the Harry Potter series, about a downtrodden orphan who discovers that he is a wizard. So of course, a movie adaptation was inevitable.<br /><br />And unfortunately, the movie adaptation of &#34;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&#34; didn't quite manage to capture movie magic. While a competent enough retelling of JK Rowling's debut novel, it's still hampered by a trio of child actors who haven't figured out how to act yet, mediocre direction by Chris Columbus, and special effects that are... not very special. What keeps this movie from completely sinking is the performances of the talented secondary cast.<br /><br />For his entire life, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has been abused and downtrodden by his only living family, the repulsive Dursleys. But on his eleventh birthday, he's greeted by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), who reveals Harry's true nature -- he is a wizard. Even more impressive, he was the &#34;Boy Who Lived&#34; -- a mere baby who somehow killed the malevolent Lord Voldemort after the evil wizard murdered both his parents. And now he's being whisked away from his miserable life with the Dursleys, to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />Despite his newfound celebrity, Harry quickly adapts to his new life of owls, casting spells, invisibility cloaks, dark enchanted forests, paintings that speak, and a broomstick-based sport called Quidditch. But he begins to suspect that his surly potions teacher Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is scheming to steal an ancient magical object called the Sorcerer's Stone -- and that he might be trying to restore Voldemort to power. But as he and his friends try to get to the Sorcerer's Stone first, they find that they may be out of their depth.<br /><br />There is one sentence that sums up this whole movie: &#34;It'll get better in future movies.&#34; Just about every aspect of this movie is either resolutely mediocre, or artistically reminiscent of other stories (&#34;Young Sherlock Holmes,&#34; the Narnia books) -- and while of course fans will thrill to see their beloved books translated into visual form, the resulting movie is simply not that good. It's not dramatically bad, just rather tedious and unexceptional.<br /><br />A great deal of the blame lies with Christopher Columbus, who does a pretty solid job of introducing us to Harry, the Dursleys, and the first glimpses of the magical world... but once Harry gets to Hogwarts, the plot loses steam and just plods awkwardly along until it gets to the climax. He tries to remain faithful (sometimes too faithful, as evidenced by the &#34;troll boogies&#34; scene), but keeps and condenses things that feel awkward and shoehorned-in (such as Hagrid's baby dragon, who has zero impact on the overall story). In other words, he seems too distracted by fidelity to the book to adapt it properly.<br /><br />The castles and cathedrals used for Hogwarts are absolutely stunning, but the film also has some painfully bad CGI -- the Quidditch scenes, McGonagall turning from a cat into a woman, the troll and the centaurs are embarrassing. This movie came out in the same year as &#34;The Fellowship of the Ring&#34; -- there is no excuse for these effects to look this bad.<br /><br />And even more unfortunately, a story about three eleven-year-olds requires child actors. None of them can act. Yes, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson would all become respected young thespians later on, but in this movie they are a blinking plank of wood, a slightly affected and goggle-eyed kid who seems slightly dazed at all times, and a prissy little girl who OH-ver-en-UN-ciates EV-ryTHING while wagging her head like an annoying maiden aunt. Tom Felton does a somewhat better job, but is sadly given little to do except sneer.<br /><br />In fact, the saving grace of this movie is the acting by the supporting cast, most of whom are seasoned veterans -- the venerable Richard Harris plays a somewhat fragile but genially grandfatherly Professor Dumbledore, and is backed by the magisterial Maggie Smith and the sullenly brooding Rickman. And woven through the remainder of the film are other great actors like Robbie Coltrane as the lovable Hagrid, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and John Cleese.<br /><br />While the later movies would improve dramatically, &#34;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&#34; is a movie buoyed up by attachment to the books and little else -- it's mildly amusing, but the cringeworthy child actors and plodding pace may make it a chore for anyone who isn't a die-hard fan.ris plays a somewhat fragile but genially grandfatherly Professor Dumbledore, and is backed by the magisterial Maggie Smith and the sullenly brooding Rickman.

B00005OAIE|2.0|I like John Mayer's music, so this isn't a stab at that.  The cd just did not live up to my expectations.  His acoustic versions of songs are a lot better in my opinion than what is on the cd.  The &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot; sounds awful next to the acoustic version.  The one really redeeming song on it was &quot;My stupid mouth.&quot;  It is really catchy and fun, and sounds good electric.  The tone of the other songs needs an acoustic guitar to really get the full effect.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have probably watched this movie 10 times since i bought it last month, and I laugh out loud every time.<br />There are so many memorable seens, from the \\"I like that boulder, that is a niiice boulder\\" to the scene with the frog and snake balloons.  The animation is incredibly lifelike and fits the manner in which lines are said.  In fact, I feel like you can recognize which actor plays whom just by looking at the features of the character.<BR>The script is incredibly witty, funny for little kids, all the way up to adults (even funny for teenagers like me). I was a camp counselor this summer and the campers and counselors must hve had a shrek conversation at least once a week.  You have to give this movie a shot, it is one of my all-time favorites.<BR>I like it, really...<br />Really really

B00004RF98|5.0|This isn't my favorite but i still enjoy it everytime i watch it with friends and family.  I've had the VHS version for years and the stereo sound was really good for VHS.  But the DVD version for the sound is terrible. It states that it is 5.1.  This is a lie! I'm a nut when it comes to sound and i'm not trying to brag but i have a THX system which is in my estimation the top of the line and pretty much the best that money can buy if your crazy enough to want to purchase one,,,anyhow, i digress.The sound is weak and there really isn't any separation and this movie wasn't enhanced for stereo but was actually filmed in stereo, four channel magetic to be exact. What was the studio thinking when they transferred this to DVD? I was extremely disappointed. Everything comes from the center channel with some surround from the rear. The sub woofer, left and right channels are just about noticeable.  TERRIBLE JOB! They should be made to do it over until they get it right.
B000069HKH|5.0|I love Nebraska. I love Sam Cooke, and I love Otis Redding. This record is a major achievment, deserving the praise placed on top. Soul speaks for itself, and Bruce oozes.  I don't care if this album is not, track for track, up to his best record.  These people have it right, it is a small miracle.<br />It's only a record, but twice as valuable as half the tripe on this site.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was a kid.  The actors are all suited for the rolls perfectly.  Some of the jokes are so subtle it has to be watched more than once to catch them. (Nice to see you again Ah Wang!)  I recommend this movie to any mystery or comedy lover.  It's a classic!
B00005RRG8|5.0|If you like Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara, and Hayley Mills, you will adore this charming film with all of them playing one of their best roles.  The movie is one that one must see in his or her lifetime, it is that great.  Hurry if you have not seen it!  Also take in Hayley Mills in 'The Moonspinners', which is her best film.
B000063DI8|4.0|Iron Maiden's fans are a fervent bunch, but they have no gripes about attacking this album.  They also have no hangups about ripping Janick to pieces.  Sure, we all loved Adrian, but no one had a gun to his head telling him to leave.  This album seems to be the one that split the fans right down the middle(or more like 70/30), and this is before Blaze came into play!  I've been a huge Maiden fan since I was a kid(when Somewhere In Time was the most recent album).  Maybe if I heard No Prayer..now I would have a different opinion of it, but I love it, what can I say?  I guess it's only for really hardcore fans like myself.  I'd say it's their version of Point Of Entry.  It's a little more mellow and maybe not as catchy as previous albums, but I just love Running Silent...Running Deep.  That one I hope even the most diehard hater of this album would find merit in.  So, it you're considering purchasing this album, it's just going to be a gamble for you.  If you love everything else they've done(early and later), then it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy this.

B00005JKDR|4.0|My kids are 13 and 17, and we've been going to Disney movies together since they were babies--with no end in sight, thanks to Pixar. Of all the Disney movies, the Pixars are our favorite, and this is the best of all of them, in our opinion. I can see why Disney will make a fortune on this movie as they did with all the other Pixar movies--they appeal to the whole family, so it is no hardship to the parents to sit through the show multiple times with their eager kids, and, of course, we all want to own the DVD!<br />Speaking of which, this DVD is a 2-disc collector's edition with many bonus features, including several short animated films, the filmmakers' audio commentary, and hilarious outtakes. You also have a chance to tour and become an employee at the Monsters, Inc. Factory and also take a tour of the real-live Pixar Animation Studios.<br />As for Monsters, Inc., itself, what I personally love most of all in the Pixar movies is the great humor, and this movie is a scream. Billy Crystal (When Harry Met Sally) is one of my favorite comedians, and he is wonderful as the voice of Mike Wizowski, a small, one-eyed, monster who is full of hilarious neuroses. John Goodman (The Flintstones) is a favorite comedian of mine, too. The character he voices, the large, loveable, fuzzy monster named James P Sullivan, melds in a perfect, comic team with Billy Crystal's character. Steven Bucemi (Con Air) always does a great job as a scary villain, and he is super as the voice of the slimy Randall Boggs. The actor voicing the tiny girl in the movie is fabulous, too, and the character herself is adorable.<br />As usual, the Pixar animation is mind-bogglingly gorgeous. My favorite scene in the whole movie is when James P is going through multiple, magical doors into child's room after child's room, all around the world. Some of the animation art in those rooms is so stunning, it could hang in a museum. I particularly liked the Paris bedroom.<br />Finally, one of the most important parts of a movie is the ending, and I found the closing in this one both funny and very moving.arts of a movie is the ending, and I found the closing in this one both funny and very moving.
B00005JKDR|3.0|While I'm not the biggest fan of Disney flicks, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to check out an advance copy of Monsters Inc's deluxe 2-DVD set. Aside from the amazing CGI work that has made Pixar a pre-eminent production company in the field, I found M-Eye to be a decent presentation that makes little effort to break the hackneyed Disney character format of the strong-yet-gentle hero, his cynical motormouth of a sidekick who always has plenty of snide remarks to lay out, and the slimy, underhanded villain. Interestingly enough, I found the guys who voiced these roles-- John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi, respectively-- to fit their characters perfectly. And the usual silly moments that you'd expect from a Disney toon-film also pop up from time to time. Otherwise, it's a fairly charming and safe movie for the young'uns-- well, except perhaps for the Abominable Snowman's lemon snow cones and the deep belch gag-- and a not-half-bad diversion for the young at heart.<br />The secondary commentary track, covered by four of the picture's producers and/or directors, discusses the talents of the voice actors and some of the original concepts for the film to a small degree. But for the most part their coverage is on the technical aspects of the flick, such as the difficulties of trying to imitate certain surfaces, textures, and shading in CGI (like Sully's \\"fur\\", for example). I was especially amused by their discussion of how incredibly cavernous the door-storage facility \\"set\\" was, which allegedly could fit the Statue of Liberty on each \\"floor\\", were it a real set. The THX-mastered picture and sound were top-notch in the way of sharpness and clarity.<br />Much like its other deluxe 2-Disc Disney cinematic brethren (Snow White, Tron, et. al.), The House of The Mouse and Pixar threw in everything but the kitchen sink onto the second platter. There's an entire behind-the-scenes tour of Pixar Studios that outlines the production of Monsters Inc fromthe voice acting to storyboarding and many other phases of production. There's also an M-Eye 'blooper reel', company play program, deleted scenes, a couple of bonus Pixar shorts (both with commentary tracks), storyboard & concept art galleries, the Monsters, Inc training guide, games for the kids, and lotsa other tchotchkes that'll likely take many hours for you to go through. If you don't find one part of interest, simply check something else out!<br />Then there's the 'practical' special features. The English subtitles match up very well with the spoken dialogue, and even describe some of the sounds being made in each scene. You can also select between widescreen and standard pan-and-scan presentations! You know, just in case your TV screen isn't big enough for you to fully appreciate the widescreen format, or something of the like...<br />'Late
0789723107|4.0|I liked this book a lot. I liked the way the author rewrote some web pages and then displayed them so the reader could understand better. This book made me rethink my stand on pop-up menus and reexamine taglines. The author wrote this book for beginners and advanced users. So yes Mr. Krug does talk about how good tabs are for navigation. But aren't they. The only thing that did not interest me a whole lot was the last four chapters which were about web design teams, how to do usability testing and then what to do with the results. This is only a hobby for now and I have no budget. But in the author's defense he does talk about how to do testing on 10 cents a day. I think this book has helped my site and I am glad that I bought it.
0441172717|5.0|The novel Dune is one of those works that you hear of by reputation as being a classic and which you always see in the bookstore but never seem to pick up to read. I had seen the David Lynch film when I was younger and was confused and bored by it. I borrowed a copy of the Dune tv mini-series recently, and after watching one episode I found the story intriguing but the special effects lacking. So I decided to read the book in order to experience a better effects company, my imagination. <br />To me, one of the things that makes Dune unique is its glimpse of what the future holds for the human race. It isnt a future controlled by machines and dominated by technology as so many science fiction worlds are. The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world. Going along with that thought, this universe is filled with court intrigue. The known universe is loosely ruled by an emperor named Padashan IV who keeps his rule going with the threat of his imperial guard, elite fighting units called Sardaukar. He also keeps his noblemen in suspicion of each other and sometimes helps bring about actual wars between them if it suits his purpose. <br />As the book opens, one of his most respected noblemen, Duke Atreides, is sent to the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) to take over spice production. Spice is the most important product in the universe and whoever controls it, controls power, and brings danger on themselves. One of the sources of conflict is that the Atreides have replaced the House Harkonnen, their bitter enemies, on Arrakis, so the whole place smells like a trap waiting to spring. The Harkonnens have sworn eternal war, called \\"kanly\\" with the Atreides and it is only a question of when and how they will strike. In addition to this, there are mysterious native inhabitants on Dune, known as Fremen, whose allegience is unknown, and the Duke also has to deal with giant sandworms who can swallow ships whole. <br />The main character of the book is Paul Atreides, son of the duke, a fifteen year old boy trained by the best fighters in the galaxy and also learned in the ways of his Bene Gesserit mother. The Bene Gesserits remind me of the Jedi in Star Wars. They are trained psychics who have strange powers feared and respected among the general populace, such as future vision, and can sometimes control weak minds and sorta steer the galaxy. Some say that Paul is destined for some terrible purpose that will lead the human race to a new destiny.<br />This is a great book. Like the Lord of the Rings, you can tell that Herbert not only wrote this book, but in the process developed and shaped his world with legends and past histories that are only hinted at in this work. There is lots of action and adventure and also religious questions and philsophy, almost a little for every kind of ruler. It does have its dull moments, especially after Paul meets his destiny, but you have to expect that anytime you have a work that is an \\"epic\\". There's so much information that not all of it can be interesting. There is a large cast of characters, so I would maybe suggest watching the first episode of the tv series like I did because it gives you a visual reference for most of the main characters. I'm going to start the next book, Dune Messiah, today.
B00003CXA6|5.0|A take from the book, &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; Gettysburg delivers an all star cast including Jeff Daniels, Tom Berenger and the always delightful Martin Sheen. As a movie it's self this is enjoyable and the kids will enjoy all the action and the adults will like the story line and most will just love the fact that they're having fun and learning. The movie isn't word for word with the book but that's ok. It's also not word for word with history with 1 or 2 mistakes. Basic plot is from July 1st to July 3rd, 1863, the largest battle in the Western Hemisphere takes place in a small Pennsylvania town practically turning the tide of the Civil War. It was a battle not meant to be but it happened. I highly recomend it.
B000001FS3|5.0|Achtung Baby is my favorite U2 album but when I heard this album (The Joshua Tree) I started getting second thoughts. This album compares to Achtung Baby dramatically. &quot;With Or Without You&quot; is far by one of the greatest love songs I have ever heard in my life, though it reminds me alot like &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; on the Achtung Baby album. That is also the same for many songs that I dont really feel like typing. Let me just say, if you like Achtung Baby you'll love this album, and if you like this album you'll love Achtung Baby because they both compare. Most songs on this album arent worth it but with the songs: &quot;I still haven't found what I'm looking for&quot; &quot;With or without you&quot; &quot;Where the streets have no name&quot; and &quot;Running To Stand Still&quot; starting off the album, you cant put it down. Though I like Achtung Baby's U2 album the best, this album still compares which makes it a grand masturpiece!
B000002J23|3.0|This is a pretty good album; Machine Messiah, in particular, measures up to anything from the Anderson/Wakeman canon.<br />The show backing this album was really cool, though. It was &quot;in the round&quot; and Machine Messiah and Into the Lens worked well live; a highlight was And You and I played in the original arrangement, complete with the acoustic guitar. Very nice!

B000051S44|5.0|This is a great racing movie but not necessarily a great movie movie. You could write the dialogue on the inside of a match book and the plot is as thin as a McDonald's burger but that's not the point, is it. This movie is about Steve, Porsches, Ferraris and speed. The movie reeks of '70's movie clich&eacute;s - long close ups, quiet looks between actors, stop action / freeze frame crashes. But some how it all works. The action scenes are why you watch this flick and if you love cars, this is the movie for you. Your non-car friends will yawn through this one (mine do) but on a rainy winter day, when LeMans is still months away and your Porsche is under the cover in the garage, this is one film that will recharge your batteries until the frost is off the pumpkin.
0767803434|4.0|As a new critic it was a honor reviewing this film. Harrison Ford showcased his talent in Air Force One. Intense performence also from Gary Oldman and a score percisely matching each scene.Blockbuster special effects taking you inside the cockpit like your experiencing it all. With exact detail to the acually plane. Not much else to say becuase I'm speechless. Must see.
B000002LIM|5.0|I still remember sitting in the darkend theater , age 6.. with my father, it was the night i will always remember. the night I saw BATMAN. and every since that night i have been obsessed with the dark knight. And I owe most of it to Elfman's brilliant score. even as a child i would go around humming the music, and 13 years later i still listen to it.. without this powerful score, the movie would have been mediocre.. dont hesitate, buy this while you can!
6302787564|4.0|I've just started as a critic. And I've been going back to some of the most compelling movies to date. There nothing more intriguing than the  tart portrayal of an dangerous struggling urban city and a man about to loose his mind on the middle of it.<br />A simple plot but gripping performence by Micheal Doughlas, followed by Robert Duvall, gave another level of of intrest towards the many &quot;street charaters&quot; that perfectly described the city. From turf driven punks to well and able homeless men. Acting was sharp. Violence/profanity was fullfilling. This might be a movie you should just go ahead and buy than rent.
B00006BTCA|5.0|First of all, I think that these guys sound a lot like Joy Division, yes, but their influences are more varied than that. When I first heard &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; I was immediately transported back to the summer of 1988.  That eternal summer of my 18th year, I was first exposed to the Chameleon's classic, &quot;The Script of the Bridge.&quot;  Since I've always considered Joy Division and the Chameleons (and the Smiths and Galaxy 500) to be timeless music, I can't honestly call Interpol derivative.  It is what it is:  a dark, guitar powered, cathartic rage.  I agree with the reviewers before me: I'll take a rock revival like this any day over much of the emo-schlock put out as &quot;indy-rock.&quot;   This is, by far, the best album of the year.  I imagine that most Gen-Xers creeping toward middle age will agree with me.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've got a feeling this album debut album of subdued and somber songs will be making us all say, &quot;Alicia who?&quot; come time for the next Grammy Awards. While many women in music today put other assests over their talent to make it there's no nead for Norah Jones to do so as she just has so much of it. Talent that is. Finally a jazz vocalist breaks the mold that D. Krall and C. Wilson have been pushing these past years and finds it's way firmly embeded into the mainstream. And rightly so.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I like(d) Wilco, so after all the hype this was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, success is a powerful fertilizer for the human ego. A little critical acclaim, sell a few records, and you start thinking you're an artist or something. Over-produced, pretentious drivel. It \\"stinks\\"...
B000068PQ0|5.0|Stop the presses---I have just heard a new musical masterpiece. In fact, I'm gonna go even further---\\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" by The Flaming Lips is one of the greatest albums EVER! I am serious. I discovered this musical gem while shopping in a music store recently, where it was playing on the overhead speakers, and I totally fell in love with it right from the word go. I bought it then and there, and have been playing it constantly ever since. I must confess, I never gave The Flaming Lips that much attention over the years, though I recall hearing their radio hit, \\"She Don't Use Jelly\\" back in the early 90's. But thanks to \\"Yoshimi,\\" I'm *definitely* gonna check out their other albums. I've heard that the Lips re-invent themselves with every new album, so I don't expect their other works to sound anything like \\"Yoshimi,\\" but I'm ready for the challenge of their back catalog anyway. These guys are friggin' phenomenal! How to describe \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\"? I'd describe it as a cross between The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" (and you know how classic those albums are), with a spoonful of Radiohead, a dash of The Alan Parsons Project, and a pinch of Genesis (circa 1976) tossed in for extra measure. Flaming Lips leader Wayne Coyne has said recently in interviews that \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" isn't really a concept album. Well, to my ears, he's only half right. The winning tale of Yoshimi and those darned pink robots only appears in the two-part title song and nowhere else, BUT I can definitely hear a theme of sorts when I listen to this album. The theme appears to be about life & observations in an advanced, technological world of the future. Song subjects range through war (\\"Fight Test\\"), robots who are programmed to love, ala \\"A.I.\\" (\\"One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21\\"), a sing-along tune about robots of destruction & the spritely karate girl who goes up against them (the supremely appealing title track &it's delirious instrumental finale), unrequitted love (\\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell\\"), mortality (\\"Do You Realise?\\"), and living in the moment (\\"All We Have Is Now\\"). And there's also a glorious instrumental ride into the heavens to finish off the album in soaring, appropriate fashion (\\"Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon\\"). \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" transports you to another world, it's spellbinding music & sounds enthrall, entertain, excite, and intoxicate. I haven't heard musical soundscapes THIS dreamy in many a year. In fact, I can totally see a Laserium show done to this album, I'm not kidding! Wayne Coyne is, without question, a musical genius. His singing is excellent, his composing is superb, his lyrics & wordplay are right on target, and his solid playing, as well as that of Lips co-horts Steven Drozd & Michael Ivins, is outstanding. Even the album's cover art is guaranteed to make you smile. From end to end, \\"Yoshimi\\" is a complete package. Against all of the odds, against all of the garbage that's currently out there in musicland right now (with few exceptions), The Flaming Lips have concocted one of those very rare \\"every home should have one\\" albums, a true home run platter of music where every single song is a winner, every single note played, sung, and arranged is 100% perfect. Since I don't know to what extent radio and/or MTV are going to help The Flaming Lips in the promoting of this fabulous album, I say it's entirely up to us. BUY THIS ALBUM. TELL TWO FRIENDS ABOUT IT. SPREAD THE WORD. Let's get \\"Yoshimi\\" up the charts and into people's homes where it belongs. No doubt about it in my mind, The Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" is THE album to beat in 2002. :-)
0316666343|5.0|...This is a well-told story from a fresh perspective.  Although<br />the story is exceptional and the premise is refreshing and bold, the plot dwindles away like the memory of the main character.<br />Telling the story of the late fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\"--and why the author chose this name is one of the mysteries of this novel)who was recently murdered, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" presents a fresh voice in contemporary literature. We see the entire story from Susie's vantage point in her heaven, a plot device that is at once brilliant and daunting. As we watch the devastation that Susie's unsolved murder wreaks on her family and the community in which she lived, the reader is treated to a multi-viewpoint narrative...a treat in itself. Susie is able to hear the thoughts and see the actions of every character in the book, including those of her murderer.<br />That there is no real retribution in the story of the man who brought down his murderous wrath on Susie and numerous others, is a point that sticks in my mind as one of the weaker plot issues.<br />Reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a joy, and I recommend this to everyone looking for an interesting novel from a different perspective on life.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I still remember how blown away I was when I first heard the title track back in 1990 and now after more than a decade this song and the album are now my favorites from TFF. A mix of blues, rock, jazz &amp; pop, this CD is a must have. The bonus tracks are great as well.<br />Sure The Big Chair was great but this CD is much more sophisticated in my opinion. Go and buy this CD. It's a wonderful treat for the ears.
B00005614M|5.0|This album not only put Miles Davis on the map, it started a whole new style of jazz music.  Miles worked with Gil Evans on this 1949 project and the results were pure magic.  The supporting cast of musicians are a nice group too.  He even had french horn players (Junior Collins on one session, Sandy Goldstein on another and Gunther Schuller).  Most of the musicians Miles worked with on this album were white, because those were the only people he could get hired at the time.  Of these musicians, Gerry Mulligan (baritone saxophone), Lee Konitz (alto saxophone) and Kai Winding (trombone) all shine the most.  Tracks like \\"Move\\" showcase the band's chemistry and innovative, playful harmonies.  This song was originally recorded as a bebop tune, but Miles and company give it a little bit more of a cool, swinging style.  \\"Jeru\\" is the ultimate definition of cool jazz.  This Gerry Mulligan composition shows off Miles and Gerry's soloing abilities.  It also has a nice theme and some good ensemble playing.  \\"Moon Dreams\\" is kind of like a musical \\"still life\\", this ballad is played with a slow seriousness that makes it a classic.  The ensemble playing here is beautiful.  \\"Venus De Milo\\" is another Mulligan composition and has a somewhat laid-back latin feel.  I like this tune because it just sounds nice to sit back and listen to.  \\"Budo\\" is a classic Bud Powell tune, while this track only lasts about two and a half minutes, it's a classic instantly.  The ensemble playing is very energetic and Miles, Lee Konitz and Kai Winding all take great solos.  This tune was also recorded by Miles around the time of the 'Round About Midnight sessions.  \\"Deception\\" is a track that Miles is given credit for writing but it's really another track called \\"Conception\\", that Miles recorded later on in the Dig session of 1951.  It's a nice tune, with a kind of tension-building theme sequence, along with a nice solo from Miles.  \\"Godchild\\" has a great theme because all the lower instruments play it making it a fun, playful track.  Once again, Miles plays a nice solo and Kai Winding takes a good trombone solo as well.  \\"Boplicity\\" has credit given to Miles Davis's mom, although she didn't actually write the piece, Miles and Gil Evans did.  \\"Boplicity\\" is a masterful cool composition and has been recorded many times by other musicians.  Gerry Mulligan starts it off with a great sax solo and Miles leads in with the group and then playing a good solo.  Other tracks like \\"Rocker\\" and \\"Israel\\" were very influential in structure and composition, along with John Lewis's \\"Rouge\\", which has string bass played and is a very fun and amusing piece.  The album ends with the Kenny Hagood vocal feature \\"Darn That Dream\\", which is a slow piece that wasn't recorded until 1950 (along with a couple other tracks from the \\"late\\" sessions).  Hagood's vocal is cool, and Miles plays an outstanding solo in the middle of the piece.  The band backs the vocal very well ending the album nicely.<br />This is a classic album, as everyone else has previously stated.  Not much left to say.
B00003CX95|4.0|Well deserving of all the Oscars it's received, Braveheart is a must for any movie buff's collection. Short--severely short--on extras, this DVD does have an excellent commentary by director Gibson, but we don't get to see one frame of the hours of extra footage he says he shot! I for one would gladly welcome a double disc version with those sorely missing deleted scenes.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Alright, so Resident Evil has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad characterization and bad plot development. How can this possibly be any good? It's simple; you forget all the above because it's just so much fun.

The development and timing of the plot needed some work; some things were revealed too late, some too soon, but the film's energy distracts you from dwelling on that too much.

B000000993|5.0|This was my first Tool album, and I'd like to say to right off that if you don't own any Tool, you should probably buy this one first, not so much because it is more accessible, more that it is simply  a bit less complex musically than the later ones, so hearing it after them might be a bit of a disappointment. This is especially bad, since it really is an excellent album by itself, even if it doesn't stand up next to Aenima at all, and is probably worse than Lateralus. But anyway, on to the review.<br />As good as this album is, I think people tend to look at it as being more innovative and progressive than it is, since their later stuff really is. Though the songs are pretty long, feature a pretty good variety of texture and tones, and stray from pop structures quite a bit, this is still a fairly straight forward alt-metal album (which their later 2 albums really weren't). However, it distinguishes itself from others simply buy being superior to pretty much any other straight forward alt-metal album in every way. Maynard is my favorite vocalist, for any band in any style, bar none. Adam Jones may not be terribly technical, but he is more so than most alt-metal guitarist, and is a lot more inventive and distinctive than most of them. D'Amour bass guitar really stands out, particularly in the interplay between him and Jones. One thing that makes this album different and more enjoyable is the extreme prominence of the bass. The bass is given the greater focus on this album than any other that I've heard, except possibly some Rage stuff. The bass guitar takes the lead with ambient guitar supporting it as much as it adds power to the heavier, more metallic parts of the album. Carrey's drumming is solid, though not nearly as interesting as on the later albums, but he still gets the job done. The lyrics are generally pretty good, extremely dark, but well written for the most part. They generally displays a strong distaste for other people, which is fine, because I don't like people either.<br />Track listing aside, this album really has only 9 songs, and one, bizzare, concept piece. The 9 songs are all strong, though with out a too much variety. The opener, \\"Intolerance\\" is one of the faster, more straight forward songs, with some great bass work. It's followed by \\"Prison Sex\\", the less popular of the two singles. Lyrically it is somewhat unpleasant, unsurprisingly, but it's musically strong. Interestingly enough, this song is arguably the least dark sounding song on the album, though still very dark. \\"Sober\\" follows, which is of course the best known song on the album. I've gotten a bit tired of it, over the thousands of times I've heard it on the radio, but it still is a good song, overplayed or not. It's got a very nice bass line as well. \\"Bottom\\" is the heaviest song on the album, at least at the beginning and end. It's got particularly bleak lyrics and includes a weird, spoken word bridge, which works surprisingly well. \\"Crawl Away\\" has got a great main riff, though it is a bit repetitive. \\"Swamp Song\\" follows, as one of the slower, moodier pieces, with a great flowing bass line, once again. \\"Undertow\\" is the most complex shifting piece on the album, with some particularly well written lyrics as well. \\"4 degrees\\" is one of the weirder, vaguely eastern sounding songs. It's arguably the weakest on the album, though it' still quite good. The lyrics are a bit unpleasant as well. \\"Flood\\" is the last real song, and is one of the best. It feature a great, crushingly powerful 4 1/2 minute instrumental introduction, and some very good vocals when they actually start. \\"Disgustipated\\" is just weird. No real point in trying to describe it, but it's still pretty fun. It also features the one attempt at humor on the album, and actually is kind of funny, in a weird way.<br />The only real potential flaw of any note is the extreme bleakness of this album makes it so that I'm not always in much of a mood to listen to it. This is easily the darkest album I own, in a collection that is predominantly heavy metal, and it is genuinely and believably dark, and never forced or theatrical like many other bands. So if you don't like dark, angry music, this definitely isn't for you.<br />So, all in all, Tool rules, go buy all of Tool's stuff.kest album I own, in a collection that is predominantly heavy metal, and it is genuinely and believably dark, and never forced or theatrical like many other bands.

B0000070XV|5.0|Yes! This is a forgotten gem. Very nice stuff indeed. Whoever wrote TB-sheets (Van Morrison I still believe), this is a crying time song, thrilling. Also the duet with Van The Man Morrison is breathtakin'. And what about Charlie Musselwhite, just great. It's an old record, and you can tell, but it sounds like a real classic and as fresh as ever. Get it!

This is a fact the director and actors aknowledge on one of the great new documentaries on this DVD as well. However, Usual Suspects is a film that deserves the &quot;special&quot; treatment. Excellent commentary by editor and composer John Ottoman and a seperate commentary w/ director Singer and Writer McQuarrie--who were highschool friends and give a truly entertaining look at the movie that launched their careers. So yes, stop complaining and just buy the friggin' DVD. It's worth it.

B000005IS1|5.0|\\"Kick Out the Jams\\" is the perfect fix whether you want to unwind, wind up, blast an extra shot of life into a party, or just set an aura of energy into a lethargic mood.<br />From J.C. Crawford's opening declaration \\"It's time for each and every one of you to decide whether you are going to be the problem, or whether you are going to be the solution,\\" to the very last track, this album is sheer musical energy. I've heard lots of noise that has tried to pass itself as music, and some decent musical noise, but this album is the archetype where noise and music collide and embrace to perfection. This is one of those rare live albums that would just not speak the same language in a recording studio.<br />What strikes me most about this album is that the first four songs are all distinctly different works, yet with the last chorus of \\"Rama-Lama-Fa-Fa-Fa\\" you feel as if you've listened to just one brilliant body of work. \\"Rambling Rose\\" is sheer jubilant chaos, \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" is a loud yet steady declaration. My favorite shift comes with the grinding methodical paced cries of \\"Together in the Darlkness\\" during \\"Come Together\\" that keeps the music at a steady pressure barely below boiling, before bursting into the explosive \\"Rocket Reducer #62.\\" <br />This CD is one of the best bargains you will ever find. MC5 may be a reference to the 1960s and the birth of punk, but this music<BR>is timeless.
0783225792|5.0|I just don't understand anyone who has an unkind word about this film. Only God could have made it better,...or Jesus, or perhaps Kevin Smith. It was factual, perfectfully photographed, it has everything. One of best crime family movies. I liked it better than Goodfellas, better than Donnie Brasco. Anyone who had it all, got a divorce, and watched his empire evaporate, can live this movie.
B000068PQ0|5.0|That's what this CD is. I bought it as an impulse buy, not really sure what to think of the Flaming Lips, other than that they were eccentric. I popped it into my CD player, and it hasn't left it. <br />The execution of this CD is flawless. Some argue that &quot;Yoshimi battles the Pink Robots, pt. 2&quot; is the only poor track on this CD. I disagree. This song is just so different, it doesn't really fit the scheme of the album. The title track is perfect, almost pop-like (definately could get played on the radio) and it's companion is the converse, a rock-like track laden with screaming (is it the robots? Yoshimi? either way, it's flippin' awesome)<br />The other songs are perfect as well. My favorite is &quot;All we have is Now&quot; but the obvious gem from the CD, &quot;Do you Realize?&quot; (which could pass as a cut song from The Soft Bulletin) is great too.<br />The reviewers who don't give high marks to this don't understand or haven't listened to it enough. <br />Do yourself a favor, buy this CD now. Be a convert like me.
6305090564|4.0|Well I bet that got your attention....Sometimes a movie is good just because its fun to watch and DEEP RISING is one of those rare gems. Not every movie has to be &quot;better and newer&quot; just to be fun. Call this a 50's B movie for gen X (did I actualy say that???)
B000066C6F|4.0|Major popcorn movie. No, not Oscar-caliber by any means, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours. Very much a product of its era (the 1980's), which is part of its appeal these days, a major flashback. If you're looking to relive the days of the Jane Fonda workout backed by the music of the Pointer Sisters, Dan Hartman, Berlin and a young (then yet unknown) Whitney Houston duetting with Jermaine Jackson, this is what you've been looking for. The plot is somewhat laughable (John Travolta as an ethically questionable Rolling Stone reporter in lust/love with aerobics instructor Jamie Lee Curtis, who is trying to hide a bit of a dicey past), but it's still a good time, what with the workout scenes and all the talk of promiscuous sex. Ignore the story for the most part and concentrate on the silliness that was the 1980's and you're in for a treat. Jamie Lee Curtis shines as always (and was in the best physical shape of her life). Good flick, goofy and mostly light fare.
0451169514|5.0|I've heard many people say this is the most frightening King novel they've ever read. What's interesting, is that it isn't so much the villian in the story, as it is the almost eerie realism of the characters and the way the reader relates to their dilemma that makes this book hit home on so many levels. After reading it cover to cover several times, I still come to new in- depth realizations about the story and the true meaning of it.  On the surface, yes, it is a rather graphic and intense horror story; yet the deeper you look, the more you begin to understand that King inteneded this story to be so much more than what it initially appears to be. In this masterpiece (and no, I don't use that word lightly), King presents to us an extremely sad and bittersweet truth about life, a truth that is sometimes realized in childhood as is the case of the seven main characters in this novel. Every child's universal fear revolves around the existence of monsters. It is a fascination that is rarely examined, and usually disregarded. Here, King challenges the notion in a profound and adult way. Perhaps King is on to something. Monsters do in fact exist. Some of them live in our house, some of them are teachers, some of them live next door. Children are aware of evil, much more so than adults, and yet their innocence prevents them from tying their suspicions about \\"monsters\\" to the harsh realities of day to day life. They recognize the source as something rightfully non-human and devastating, while at the same time they right off the catalysts of it's power as simply victims themselves. In a child's eyes, it's impossible to lay blame on a trusted adult or friend. \\"It\\" is responsible, whatever it may be. This inner turmoil often spawns itself into adulthood, the struggle between innocence and trust and the atomic blast of reality. And the truth is, as King knows, that it never really is resolved. Every day we struggle with good and evil, and it is in the journey itself and the relationships we form that we find our redemption. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this novel. I must warn you however, that the book touches on extremely controversial topics such as child abuse, teen sex, and graphic violence. It must be approached with an open mind and mature outlook. Regardless of the tone at times, it is definitely worth it.

0743201140|4.0|Based on extensive research done by Gallup (the polling organization), NOW, DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS is about developing human strengths instead of trying to improve weaknesses.  The authors begin by making a remarkable point:  that people succeed better in their careers when they go with what comes naturally to them instead of trying to develop abilities they are lacking in.  They illustrate their ideas from the point of view of an employee as well as from a management viewpoint.  After a 30-year study including interviews with over 2 million people, the authors condense the results into a detailed description of 34 strengths - patterns or themes that can contribute to your personal and professional success.  They provide a website where you can take their online strengths test, and they stress the fact that it is not the type of test you fail.  It is more about observing yourself without judgment.   <br />The tone of the book is good-natured and encouraging:  \\"Spontaneous reaction, yearnings, rapid learning, and satisfactions will all help you detect the traces of your talents.\\"  One of the most valuable things I read in the book was how often people are reluctant to build on their own strengths because mediocrity and failure are so much less risky.  I encourage anyone attracted to this book's ability to present new possibilities for your life to read a copy of WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The Kanes are masters in the art of showing people how to transform possibilities undreamt of into everyday realities.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This sort of movie is not really my thing, but I enjoyed it just the same, and I can recognize it certainly is a fine movie. I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action-type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.<br />The overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory-impaired Guy Pearce try to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out despite his memory impairment.<br />Before his memory defect occurred, he was an insurance fraud investigator, and if it's one thing he learned from his old job, it's the importance of having a system for gathering the facts and considering the evidence. Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.<br />One minor fault. In the movie, Pearce denies a claimant his insurance money because he \\"proves\\" that his impairment isn't due to disabling neurological causes, but due to his lack of effort to remember. In fact, from the symptoms, the guy obviously has what's known as complete anterograde amnesia, which is the opposite of the famous retrograde amnesia that many people are familiar with and has been used equally sensationally in movies. Pearce doesn't believe it's real, or at least he can throw enough doubt on the case to give his insurance company a way out, and thereby deny the man his money.<br />I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine. All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.
B00005JKDR|5.0|After seeing the movie in the theaters, we knew we'd be buying this one for home.  With an advance copy of this DVD in hand, I became a hero with my kids this week.  My daughters and I found ourselves laughing out loud at the exclusive segment \\"Mike's New Car,\\" and at the familiar humor of \\"For the Birds,\\" (the short Academy Award winning piece that preceded the movie in theaters).  But there's more than that.  You have the chance to explore Monstropolis from a human or monster eye view.  You'll find games and more.  This 2-disc edition is well worth it.<br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a great family film.  It looks great, sounds great, and tells a good story.  The scenes are full of life and color and imagination.  My kids loved every minute of it.  By taking us into the world of monsters who are trained to scare children, Pixar somehow teaches children not to be afraid.  They demystify the terror of the dark closet, while never forgetting to throw in chuckles for the parents in the audience.  When the monsters' world is turned upside down by the unexpected intrusion of a human child, hysteria breaks loose, and everyone's bound to learn something by the end--with heartwarming and humorous moments galore.<br />This is one of my favorite animated films ever, and it get's even better with the release of this packed disc.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead has always been a band that has imagined a world beyond this one. With Pablo Honey begining their journey to the apocalypic vacant landscape of stuttering fracturing sounds and colors in KID A, who would have known the angst ridden teenager who didn't belong in Creep would be waking up in bunkers sucking on lemon living his last days on earthhaving tortured nightmares and visions of the ice age. If you think and listen back to Pablo Honey, The Bends and OK computer, KID A is not quite a shock rather an evolution in storytelling. A simple reminder at how intelligent this band is and i think the secret is that Thom Yorke and company have no idea.<BR>    Sonicly advance is a delicate dream structure. Kid A has no lines. It hangs like a foggy dream with subtle revelations. At the end you feel either elavated or annoyed that you cant remember what was unvieled to you in the midst of bombs exploding,a child crying and guitars floating. You want to tell a friend what you saw, but showing them kid A is like showing them a new colr and for some they cant see the beauty lurking in the fog.<BR>    It begins with everything falling in it right place. Displaced and ajacent voices struggling inside a broken mans head as he is crying \\"what was that you tried to say?\\".  From there we journey into his nightmares and hush dreams colliding in one techno-color stream. His paranoia, his losses, a broken marraige, War, him doubting his sanity. He struggles to find a meaning to it all while comatosed in a dark red haze.<BR>    Kid A is no OK computer, but the bends isnt either. But Radiohead has created something of their own. The next album will be another evolution for the sound Radio always changes. This is music for the head. This band does notunderestimate their audience and prehaps  with this one they overestimated them. The backlash over this album is understandable. No one saw the ice age coming. Prehaps it will thaw soon and the next few record will have our tortured character on a beached oasis looking at the sun and stars twinkle together in the daylight. Prehaps this man will find peace...the exciting thing about how this album ends is the last note before he awakes and floats off into the gates off heaven having seen hell... a sweet cliffhanger and promise to return. <BR>   \\"i will see you in the next life\\" i know i'll be waiting to hear what is in the next life.
B000065U1N|4.0|As an ex-Australian soldier watching this film, I have to give it the usual critique of \\"American hype\\", however I've read the book by Mark Bowden, and have to say that as a soldier's story it is quite true and quite graphic.  Australian soldiers were in Somalia at the time too as part of the UN peacekeeping force.  I enjoyed the fact that it didn't deal with the political framework, as mentioned before it is first and foremost a soldiers story.  As stated by Hoot (Eric Bana) near the end of the film; \\"it's about the man next to you\\".  But I think the film could have done without the chest-beating by Josh Hartnett at the end.  I was a little disappointed that the film did not depict the Somali riflemen, RPG men hiding behind, underneath, in a crowd of women and children as in the book;  that's what these young soldiers had to deal with.  Oh, and don't watch this if you're in any way squeamish.
B000003TA4|5.0|Amazing. Simply amazing, to put it in these not descriptive words. The cover is humorous enough with a baby chasing a dollar on a hook. But the tracks on the CD... they surpass many, many songs and albums. Smells Like Teen Spirit is and will always be a classic in any Nirvana fan's head - and even in other heads. Polly offers nice acoustic, as does Something in the Way. This is a MUST HAVE for any alternative rock / rock fan. You'll listen to it for hours at a time. You won't be disappointed at all - the accentuation of Nirvana could very well be this CD. I commend the band. Purchase this now. ;)
B00003CX5P|3.0|This is about the DVD only not the movie.  The picture quality was terrific on the Home Theater System and the DVD special features are great.  I was very disappointed with the sound. I expected a lot more for a THX movie. The explosions and other action scenes sounded dampened and not crisp and clear. Certainly did not have my speakers rocking like Independence Day does. I purchased this with Lord of the Rings (which has outstanding sound) and after comparing the two, Star Wars let me down .
0440416027|5.0|I read Skellig as a writer of children's books, not as a reader. There weren't any kids to tell me what they thought of it, so this review is from the standpoint of an adult, not a child.<br />Skellig, recommended by the Dripping Springs, TX librarian (there were no copies available, so I bought one), encompasses the fears of all children going through family changes. In this instance, the main character, Michael, is dealing with a move to a new place, the illness of his crib-bound younger sister, stressed parents, and the challenge of making new friends while keeping the old friends.<br />The storyline, although a little trite, is revived by the author's willingness to let his main character worry. Yes, worry. You don't really see this in Harry Potter much at all and maybe that's a downfall. Fiction for kids is often escapist and the storylines rarely work if there is too much real-life worrying it it. This one works because of the oft-used dream sequencing that makes the worrying more like a bad nightmare than a problem.<BR>The book's hook is that no one knows about Skellig except Mina and Michael who have become neighbors. Their interaction with Skellig is mystical and nicely done. <BR>The author also presents real-life dilemmas - the nature of evolution (not as opposed to religion, however) as well as the value of public schooling.<br />I'm glad I read Skellig. It will present mental challenges to youngsters who have never thought about these types of dilemmas nor the nature of their own existence.
B000067DNC|1.0|Stargate SG-1 is a terribly un-original series. All that is pertained in the series was clearly derived originally from other works of science fiction and then slightly built on. The quality of the acting and just the overall presentation is laughable. The series should have ended when the movie it was based on flopped.
B000003TA4|5.0|This was a very, very interesting - and not to mention entertaining - album from Nirvana. I love this album and I still listen to it - it hasn't gotten old, yet. This is awesome. I HIGHLY recommend you purchase this. It's well worth the money.
0345350499|5.0|I loved this book enough to add it to  my collection (I usually borrow books.) It was... like several books, melded together. Beautiful. If you're a strict Christian, you may not like this book because of the unfavorable way it treats the priests. However, it is also made clear that it is not God, or even Christianity that is bad, just the narrowmindedness of some Christians. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the sex. Way too much. Most of it was definetly unnecessary. I tend to skip those parts, because they really don't add anything. Regardless, if you like fantasy and don't object to feminism, this is a book that you have to read. Cutural literacy :)
B00005B36H|3.0|If 'Lateralus' was only Danny Carrey's drumming and Justin Chancellor's bass playing the album would be ab-so-lute-ly supendous, pero no me gusta Maynard James Keenan.<BR> I don't think any band has such an incredibley oberrated lead singer as Tool. Sure Maynard can hold a note for a good 24 seconds, in reality, so can alot of people. He's not particularly melodic, and his voice isn't overly spectacular, he doesn't have a very large range, and at least in 'AEnima'(which was actually a pretty good CD) they covered up his flaws with some good electronic voice stuff. Maynard seems like a bright guy and all but I've heard much better along the lines of singers.<BR> Adam Jones does some interesting riffs on here and Justin Chancellor is great, and thinks ups some cool stuff, but the true shining star on the album is Danny Carrey. His style is like tribal, jungle drums meets jazz meets thrash meets freeky arabic stuff. He alone salvages the entire disc, which would be alot better if it wasn't for the blabbering of Keenan.<br />Buy it just because of Danny Carrey, and the cool music videos.
6303540082|5.0|Madonna is always known to shock the world with her wild antics. In 1990, Madonna put together her most successful tour entitled, The Blonde Ambition Tour 1990. While on the tour, she had a batch of cameramen follow her around, for she was filming this incredible documentary, which showed what Madonna was like on and off stage during this tour. Her younger brother, Christopher Ciccone, makes an appearance as the set designer. Her older brother, Martin Ciccone, who is the oldest of the Ciccone siblings, makes his appearance by visiting Madonna when she takes the tour to her homestate of Michigan. Not only did her older brother stop by for her Michigan concert, her father, Sylvio Ciccone, and her stepmother came as well. Other appearances include WARREN BEATTY, MAUREEN MCFARLIN (Madonna's childhood friend), the father of one of her dancers, ANTONIO BANDERAS, SANDRA BERNHARDT, and many others. Not only do you get to see behind the scenes of her tour, you also get to see live performances from the European portion of the tour. You can tell they are the European performances because they are the ones where she did not where the I-DREAM-OF-JEANIE ponytail. You see, she kicked off the tour in Asia and then brought to the U.S. and Canada after Asia. During the Asian portion and the U.S. portion, she wore the ponytail. But when she got Europe, she decided to leave out the ponytail because it constantly tangled itself into her headset and it drove her crazy. The featured live performances are EXPRESS YOURSELF (the tour's opener), CAUSING A COMMOTION, LIKE A VIRGIN, LIKE A PRAYER, LIVE TO TELL, OH FATHER, VOGUE, HOLIDAY, and Medley: FAMILY AFFAIR/KEEP IT TOGETHER. This is an exellent documentary and all you Madonna fans should have it. If you would like to know The Blonde Ambition Tour 1990 setlist, well, just look below.    MADONNA: THE BLOND AMBITION TOUR 1990 Setlist:    EXPRESS YOURSELF (with \\"Everynody\\" dancers introduction)  OPEN YOUR HEART  CAUSING A COMMOTION  WHERE'STHE PARTY  LIKE A VIRGIN  LIKE A PRAYER  Medley: LIVE TO TELL/OH FATHER  PAPA DON'T PREACH  SOONER OR LATER  HANKY PANKY  NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU  MATERIAL GIRL  CHERISH  INTO THE GROOVE  VOGUE  HOLIDAY  Medley: FAMILY AFFAIR/KEEP IT TOGETHER

B000059XXZ|3.0|I have to say, Jack Nicholson is perfect as the Joker, and he is the film's best element. TIm Burton does an excellent job portrying Gotham the way it should be portayed, but I have a few issues about the whole thing. First off, Michael Keaton as Batman. I mean, Batman is dark and serious. Michael keaton isn't. I know everyone says he's been the best person to portray him in the Batman movies, and that's true. I still don't like him in the role. He just doesn't create the \\"Dark Knight feel.\\" Also, Prince contributed several songs. don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Prince, some of his music is great, but it doesn't belong in this movie. Although Commissioner Gordon IS in the movie (played  by Pat Hingle), either he doesn't really get as large of a role as he should, or Pat Hingle just doesn't do a good job. It's been a while since I watched it (maybe a month), but in this film jim Gordon doesn't leave an imprint on your mind like he does in the comics (specifically \\"Batman: Year One\\" and \\"Batman: Long Halloween\\"). Finally, like another reviewer said, Batman doesn't kill. You can read that review though, since I share that opinion, and I don't want to take up unnecessary space on the site. I'd just like to comment on what another reviewer said about \\"Why couldn't they make it an origin story?\\" Well, for one thing that person obviously doesn't read Batman. If they made it an origin story, it wouldn't have a villian like most comic book heroes in movies do. Putting the Joker in an origin story would be unfaithful to the comics, and incredilbly sloppy, since the Joker doesnt show up until Batman's gone through a year as Batman. Putting them in the ame film woul be utterly unacceptable. I'd also like to say that they ARE making an origin story of  Batman. They are making the film version of the graphic novel \\"Batman: Year One,\\" which isn't a cartoony action flick like this. Batman: Year One falls more under the Drama category, as there are no villians, except for Bruce Wayne's personally demons, unless you count the corrupt Gotham City Police Department, and the gangster Carmine Falcone, but enough of that. As a Batman fan, I do enjoy watching this movie, especially after horrble failures like Batman & Robin (Arnold as Mr. Freeze? Gimme a break.). This IS the best of the series, but I'm looking foward more to the revival of the series with more serious undertones.Wayne's personally demons, unless you count the corrupt Gotham City Police Department, and the gangster Carmine Falcone, but enough of that.

B000066NW0|5.0|When I first heard the song \\"Complicated\\" on the radio, I fell in love with it! SO, soon after that, I bought the CD. The CD is awesome!!!!!! All her songs are great, and easy to relate to. She is an awesome writer, and writes mostly about boys. Ever since I got her CD, my stereo is always on with her CD, \\"Let Go\\" playing. If you buy her CD, you definatly made the right choice! I'm now her biggest fan!!!!!!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|It is rare to see a movie that can it top its predecessor in both technical production design and an overall acceleration of movement throughout a would-be-let-down sequel.  Blade 2 is one of those rare movies that just has \\"something\\" that the first one didn't have-HEART!  I feel when I watch the original Blade (which I've seen too many times to mention) it seems as though the director wanted to simply introduce an idea-\\"the world isn't what you think it is.\\"  Blade 2 has a strong (and complex) story, it's introduced it's important characters from the first one so it doesn't need to back track on things.  The exception is a few forced scenes I think they should've left out about Whisler and his history with Blade since most people already knew about that.  Aside from that, the reapers were simply a epic marvel of great prosthetics and slick CGI.  The action is faster, the gore is far more vivid and surreal and the overall look of the film is a showcase of constant improvements from the last film.  Quite simply, this DVD and film is OFF THE HOOK!  Can't wait for number 3!
0805062971|5.0|I think some of the critics of this book are missing Palahniuk's point.  Fight Club does not glorify anarchy or encourage mass destruction.  Palahniuk does his best to shock and stimulate the reader, not to encourage violence, but to open his or her eyes and stop living complacent, misguided lives.  He likes the seemingly paradoxical idea of achieving self-awareness through self-destruction.  Only by hitting rock bottom can one rise to the top.<br />Fight Club is of course the extreme example of this case, and Palahniuk's warning about extending self-destruction to destruction of others and full-blown anarchy is loud and clear.  Palahniuk's goal is to force you to open your eyes and ask yourself: what are you living for?  What are your goals in life?  If you had only one more day to live, what would you do?  And why aren't you doing those things right now?  Self-realization is not anarchy.  Neither is seeing things for what they are, not what popular culture tells you to believe.<br />Palahniuk's philosophy, evident in his other writings as well, is laid out toward the end of Fight Club: \\"We are not special.  We are not crap or trash, either.  We just are.\\"  On top of that, we \\"just are\\" for a short period of time.  Palahniuk's point: Don't waste that time by living a \\"safe\\" life, or a life dictated by others.  Love life, and live life.
B000003KMM|4.0|The Cleveland Indians haven't won a title, much less gone on to the finals for too many years. The people have become tired of their losing streak. When Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) inherits to team from her late husband, she concocts a plan to get the team to Miami by hiring a bunch of has-beens and never was-es. If they get dead last, she just might have her dreams come true. So signed onto the Cleveland Indians are manager Lou Brown (James Gammon), catcher Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger) who has bad knees, Rick 'Wild Thing' Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) who is a punk with an incredible pitching arm, a player who can't catch Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen), Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes) who may run like the wind but not hit a single ball, Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert) a man who relies on voodoo to try to improve his hits, and more. Of course the team goes through incredibly funny times as they get better at the same time Rachel Phelps give them a miserable time. So they come up with idea to stop Rachel Phelps; they'll just have to win the title! But will they ever be able to work together as a team? As starring is Rene Russo as Lynn Wells, Jake Taylor's ex-wife. Also there's Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle, the radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians.<br />Yes, probably just by reading my summary on \\"Major League\\", I'm sure you know how the story ends out. But hey, the movie entertains and humors with the sarcastic wit, hilarious jokes, obvious slapstick comedy, and laugh out loud situations. \\"Major League\\" fits right into the genre of a comedy, with all the actors doing a tremendously funny job. Everyone delivers there lines and plays their parts to perfection.<br />Unfortunately, the movie is R-rated for mostly the language. I guess all movies must have their moments of having to swear but \\"Major League\\" was a bit too much. Hence my 4 stars for this movie which could have been a 5 star movie! <br />Tom Berenger is extremely funny, and his scene where he follows his ex-wife to her fiancé's house is just hilarious! Oh, and check out Charlie Sheen's funky haircut. He certainly plays his bad boy role well. His best moment is definitely the end. He walks out onto the field and as he does, the crowd goes wild and starts singing and shouting the song \\"Wild Thing\\". Charlie Sheen just handles his character of Rick \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn very well. <br />The movie is just filled with great one-liners and sarcastic remarks. Here are a few of my favorite lines:<br />(talking about the bad service on the plane)<BR>Hayes: Vaughn, get the stewardess. I need one of those bags.<BR>Vaughn: There aren't any stewardesses.<BR>Hayes: Oh! I wonder if they are any pilots.<br />Harry Doyle: Remember, fans, Tuesday is Die Hard Night. Free admission for anyone who was actually alive the last time the Indians won the pennant.<br />Conclusion: Terrific movie but be warned that the language is most of the time too much. But \\"Major League\\" is entertaining and extremely funny so if you get a chance, check the movie out!
B00005QW5X|4.0|Certainly, there is something here worth analysis, but when I think back to seeing this movie in the theatre, I don't remember thinking of how the meaning of one song changed from its first occurrence to the second or what Hedwig says about gender identities or anything else.  I remember having a great deal of fun.  I remember laughing and getting caught up in the songs (from someone who hates musicals by the way).  I didn't walk out saying I had found a totally different movie from anything else or the new Rocky Horror or the greatest musical in human history or an exploration of blah blah blah.  I walked out with a smile on my face and a sudden need to grab the soundtrack when I next saw it.  I consider that a success.  Get it, enjoy the documentary about the evolution from play to film of Hedwig, and then analyze it if you wish.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok...lets just say that this cd ROCKS!!! alright, so some of the songs are slow, but you have to a few on every cd dont you? Seventeen-year-old Avril Lavigne put out an incredible debut album as she is falling into the musical world. The songs are all about how she feels period. Thats it. She is not trying to sell her body or looks, just her music and who cant respect that after all the Britneys have come and gone? This cd is amazing and uplifting and describes many of the real life situations that teens go through today. She is nobody but Avril Lavigne and who wouldnt be down with that?
079073639X|5.0|The OSSA discovers a spacecraft thought to be at least 300 years old at the bottom of the ocean. Immediately following the discovery, they decide to send a team down to the depths of the ocean to study the space craft. The following civilians are recruited: psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman), biochemist Dr. Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), and astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber). They are the best of best, smart and logical, and the perfect choice to learn more about the spacecraft. But even their intelligence may not be able to comprehend and understand the strange and terrifying events which start to take place after they discover a strange, golden, and perfect sphere on the craft. Things become worse as they are stranded at the bottom of the ocean without any means of escape. That's when they receive the first transmission...<br />I had heard from my father and sister that &quot;Sphere&quot; was very good and extremely well made so I decided to first check out the reviews on it. I was a little surprised to see such mixed reviews, one half saying how horrible and cheesy it was, while another half was proclaiming how wonderful, exciting, and worth watching it was. So what else was I to do but see for myself what &quot;Sphere&quot; is like? Which I did and I thought it was an excellent film.<br />I myself have never read Michael Crichton's novel &quot;Sphere&quot; (I guess that's next) so I cannot say whether the movie is true to the book or whether the book was better than the movie or vice versa. But I myself found the story very intriguing, from the mysterious origin of the spacecraft and the sphere to the events which take place in the crew's habitat. The plot was both original yet familiar, the familiar parts being one of the complaints of some watchers. &quot;Sphere&quot; had elements of many such science fiction/thrillers, most especially the dynamic film &quot;Alien&quot;. Which is not all that bad. The conclusion, when the main characters finally solve the mystery was just so incredible! The ending was a bit disappointing for me since it felt like the movie was a bit cut short. I wish the end was maybe 5 to 10 minutes longer, either lengthening the middle or adding more at the end. But on the whole the movie storyline was very satisfying.<br />As for the acting I didn't have many complaints. Dustin Hoffman is the perfect psychologist as he tries to think, reason, and solve the mysterious events. He certainly looks very terrified throughout the movie! Sharon Stone is also pretty good though some people have been saying her acting was terrible. Samuel L. Jackson is incredible as his role of the mathematician. Each and every character's reaction to all the events is acted out terrifically, making you all the more NOT want to be in their shoes! <br />But the way the movie draws you into the story is what really makes the movie entertainingly fun to watch. Well, I wouldn't really associate the word 'fun' with &quot;Sphere&quot;. &quot;Sphere&quot; is very well directed, and I meant it when I wrote down that you will get drawn into the movie. The suspense isn't generated by lots of action, it's the tension you get since &quot;Sphere&quot; is just so psychologically terrifying! The directing was simply fantastic, around the last half of the movie making you wonder who is to be trusted, and who not to be trusted.<br />Put it all together, &quot;Sphere&quot; is an exciting and suspenseful film and I enjoyed it very much. If you're convinced that &quot;Sphere&quot; sounds like something fun to watch, go for it! But if you're still contemplating whether or not it's any good, rent it out once since you'll never know if you'll like it if you never see it. Be warned though, the movie is PG-13 rated for some profanity, scary images, and some violence. &quot;Sphere&quot; is not for the weak-hearted. And whatever you do...! Don't have any nightmares... (wink!)
B0000019PA|5.0|This is an album that I revisit again and again as my CD collection grows.  I won't bore you (or me) with over-analysis of the music.  I simply will say that it's simple enough to get stuck in my head for long periods of time, but still so interesting that I have no problem listing it among my favorite albums of all time.  Great lyrics.  Wonderful music.  Elephant 6's best to me quite frankly.  Give &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; and &quot;King of Carrot Flowers 1&quot; a listen.  If you pick up the album, you'll find many of the other stand-out tunes that might not be quite so approachable in the context of a 30 second clip.  Enjoy.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is an absolutely incredible release, one of the few true classics of the genre. Guns n Roses played gritty, upbeat rock n roll, with a pantheon of influences, 'Rocks' era Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix and the like included, firmly displayed on their sleeve.<br />Far from being a drop in the ocean upon its release, this debut album created an impact akin to massive tidal waves. Exploding onto an unsuspecting scene filled with bands like Def leppard, Whitesnake and their huge selling, permed bretheren, Guns n Roses reminded the world that this type of music was harsh, dirty and far from pretty, and ushered in a new era of imitators who attempted to copy yet never succesfully reproduced the magic sound this album possesses.<br />What a sound it is. Assuming the classic rock formula with two guitarists, Guns n Roses play with a style that may be slightly derivative, yet with a power and conviction that is jaw dropping. Axl Rose's vocals may grate on the nerves of some, yet on this record he is on fine form, screeching and wailing wildly yet finding time for some more mature delivery in places. Izzy Stradlin' and Slash are both fine guitarists, Duff is an excellent bass player and punk fan who adds a touch of that style of music's rabid intensity to the band, while Steven Adler is certainly an above average drummer.<br />The album itself is surely one of the strongest debuts ever recorded. The opening bars of 'Welcome to the Jungle' seize hold of you and never let go until 'Rocket Queen' finally fades away. Consistent from start to finish, each song is a perfectly crafted hard rock gem. 'Its so Easy' is a heavily punk influenced thrash of tangible intensity, whilst 'Nightrain' is a masterpiece ode to a certain liquor. Similarly, 'Mr Brownstone' extols the virtues of substances, as well as adding a funky, jaunty twist to the hard rock base, resulting in welcome diversity. 'Paradise City' is an epic plea for home, and perhaps the most recognisable song included here, except for 'Sweet Child o' Mine', a syrupy ballad that is heartfelt and beautiful, avoiding as it does the sickening atmosphere of similar types of songs released in the 80's. The albums closer, 'Rocket Queen', is a multi-sectioned triumph, hedonistic to a fault.<br />The lyrics may tackle rock cliches fairly narrowly in places, yet when Rose sings 'Cpatain Americas been torn apart, now hes a court jester with a broken heart' on 'Paradise city' one cannot help but marvel at the social comment subtely thrown in.<br />Often imitated, certainly never bettered, this is an album everyone should own, an album that in the future will head up the relatively short list of true classics.ept for 'Sweet Child o' Mine', a syrupy ballad that is heartfelt and beautiful, avoiding as it does the sickening atmosphere of similar types of songs released in the 80's.

B00005IC2H|5.0|You don't need a biography of the band to enjoy them.  Visit their website ([...]) and check out videos of them playing.  Watch the finale of Vanilla Sky and hear some of their newer music playing behind and really carrying the scene.  The music is without a doubt amazing enough to carry it without someone trying to imagine the mountains of Iceland as the music plays or whatever b.s. scene they want to pull up.  I'll tell you as a music listener I know next to nothing of Iceland and I don't have trouble relating.  I don't need to picture a vast landscape to enjoy.  As an atheist, I can't relate to some spiritual journey through music.  As a fan of music, I can absolutely say this music is beautiful often, moving so much of the time, and always engaging.  It's a pleasure to break free of traditional pop music and get into a song that can last 10 minutes without ever losing your interest.  I honestly can say I listen to this CD, and it just flies by.  I lose track of time, I find myself closing my eyes and really focusing in on the music, and I keep coming back to it again and again.  But as I said, you can't completely take my word for it.  Listen for yourself.  30 second clips just won't do.  You'll have to go elsewhere to really get to know Sigur Ros.
B00000JQFL|5.0|I love this album because it makes you feel like you're at the concert. It also sounds like they love to perform and you can hear how excited the band and the audience sounds. My favorite songs on the CD are &quot;Can't Hide Love&quot;, Maurice makes you feel kind of guilty for denying that you are in love. &quot;Shining Star (live)&quot; is better than the original one. &quot;Sun Goddess&quot;, &quot;Devotion&quot; and &quot;Sing a Message to you&quot; are also my favorites. This is a must have. Trust me, you will feel like you are there and you will want to get a lighter and wave it in the air.
0679731377|4.0|This book affirms that Julian Barnes is a clever, creative and challenging author. He uses ten stories and an essay, bound by recurring images and themes, to weave a penetrating commentary on human history. Barnes deals with weighty themes (love, happiness, disappointment, self-deception, et cetera) and offers little comfort for his fellow observers of the human condition. He does not spare the scalpel in dissecting religion, nationalism and other forces that have driven humanity. However, his beautiful writing and superb sense of humour still make the book a real pleasure to read. As in his other books, Barnes here too produces an exceptional number of passages whose beauty and/or wisdom make me stop and re-read.<br />One could argue about whether this is a true novel or a book of thematically-linked short stories. And some of the stories are more readable or significant than others. But, on the whole, I found this a book to savour. It demands concentrated attention and constant reflection, but the effort is well worth the while. Read it, and share an exceptionally perceptive author's take on human history. You may well see many things in an altogether new light, starting with Noah' ark and the lowly woodworm...

0896762173|5.0|This book remains my favorite costume book, even 10 years after I first checked it out of the library. I find myself coming back to this book time after time, either to study a particular point of fashion or just to browse the fabulous drawings.<br />Nancy Bradfield has done a great service to all who enjoy studying vintage clothing and their construction. Each item includes 2 to 4 full-page, detailed drawings so the reader can see every detail of the original garment -- inside AND out. Many of them include measurements, so if you're a very talented seamstress/tailor, you can recreate the garments and scale them to fit a modern body.<br />Some books seem to just throw pictures or drawings together in no particular order, which makes it difficult to fully understand the fashion changes that took place. Nancy Bradfield has arranged the drawings in chronological order, which I find much easier to follow. She also has rather detailed comments along the bottom of each 2-page spread which explains particular details of the item or the fashion changes that were occuring at the time the dress was made. Those comments are in addition to the description found on the top left side of the left page, which is specific to the dress in question.<br />This is the Bible for any costumer or vintage clothing collector! The only thing that would be better is examining the clothes in person...And unlike seeing the clothes in person, you can keep going back to the drawings again and again.
0553583182|1.0|Every book on positive thinking like this one and Napoleon Hill's books are all incorrect. There is only one book? on this planet (and any based on it) that really reveals how to change your life. Ever book on positive thinking always quotes &quot;as a man thinking so he is&quot;. In this book titled &quot;The Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot; it quotes it like this-&gt; &quot;as a man thinks in his subconscious mind ..&quot; All of them miss quote this line. The correct verse is &quot;As a he thinks in his heart so he is&quot; Proverbs Chapter 23 verse 7. The power to change your life is not in your mind? thinking correct thoughts or positive thoughts is only part of the formula to create change. The truth is &quot;All that you are and all that you have today IS a result of what you've SAID! and BELIEVED! in the past. Your ACTIONS! either put you over, or they keep you under. Take a look at Proverbs Chapter 18: verse 20 and 21. And Romans Chapter 10: verse 8 to 10. Also Mathew Ch 19vs26, Mark Ch 9vs23 and Mark Ch 10vs27.

0060934913|5.0|Bourdain doesn't bother to make friends in the conventional sense - not even with his reading audience. He is brash, confident, confrontational, and at times very unlikeable. Julia Childs this is not. However I really liked this book. It is definitely a memoir of food as well as in insider view into restaurant kitchens and subculture. It also has a handy chapter of what to order and why (never order fish on Monday's for instance)<br />What I disliked about the book was actually what I came to like in the end - his seeminly long-winded explanations of everything. Yet the descriptions, often accompanied by many superlatives seem to add layers, or extra depth to the book. It is definitely not spare, but it suits a food-memoir. I am just reading a memoir by a New Zealand/Italian chef and it really suffers by comparison. It is spare and tries to be amusing. Bourdain doesn't care whether you laugh or not. However the book simply due to its subject matter and unapologetic stance is fascinating reading.<br />It starts out with his learning to appreciate food during a trip to France his family took when he was young. He, by his own admission wasn't a very amenable child on the trip -  insisting on hamburgers the whole way. Until he got left out of a restaurant. Then he started trying everything - simply ordering the most bizarre things he could for shock value. The desire to shock has clearly continued through his life. <br />He sort of fell into cooking, starting out as a dishwasher in a holiday resort town - and again that very unlikeable side of him - the arrogant swaggerer was his downfall. So he went off to cooking school - the inappropriately named CIA to learn more and to show them at the restaurant he had been humiliated at just what he was worth after all! So he did become a cook, and now a chef, and that arrogance remains - in fact it seems it is what gets someone through Cooking school and to survive in kitchens - which don't sound very glamorous. At one stage hetalks about one team of cooks he was with who would re-enact scenes from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; before starting cooking each night. And that to me really best sums up the kitchen scenes he describes - a battle-ground. He certainly links it with aa army mentality himself - the slang alone - if not the sheer volume of organisation involved.<br />He even takes us through one of his days (unenviable). I wouldn't have thought it would make that great reading  - lots of lists of things he has to do - but it is fascinating reading. Not the least because he writes about his mistakes as well as his triumphs.<br />His life and career didn't carve a traditional path, but even in the periods where he was a strung-out dope fiend the writing is more about restaurants and the restaurant trade. And it is a very sharp insider view. <br />Not that I ever wanted to be a chef, but I certainly don't want to be one now. I can't imagine Julia Child cooking in this kind of kitchen - maybe she was as foul-mouthed as they are. Bourdain does admit that not all kitchens are like his although I think maybe most of them might be. There are a lot of egos in cooking after all. <br />However this book is more than a outing for egos. It is also a food memoir and it works very well as that. Bourdain loves food and shares his memories of favourite foods, recipes and moments well.  Recommended!
B000002B82|5.0|I was in a music store and heard this CD playing in the background. I am normally not an Ozzy fan, but I just had to have this one. <BR>I rarely like new albums when I first listen to them.<BR>I identified with \\"Mama, I'm coming home\\" and \\"The road to nowhere\\" immediately. <BR>The guitar is amazing. The vocals are ... well... OZZY! <BR>Anyway, when I first heard this album the week it came out, I had to have it. I got another copy for my brother here at Amazon.com a few years later because I knew he'd love it, too.
1878424319|1.0|The cover and insert description of this book are the best part of it, and mask the internal waste of its pages.  The author should have stuck to surgery.

It is not educational.  It is not even based on anything but a few \\"common sense ideas\\", not fact or knowledge or background.

B00005KHL0|5.0|1978's &quot;Halloween&quot; is considered by many the greatest horror movie of all time. It introduced Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, a shy intelligent girl who babysits on Halloween night, and gets a evening of horror she will never forget. Laurie is stalked by Michael Myers, the most brutal and frightening horror killer of all time. With his huge butcher knife &amp; classic pasty white mask, Michael Myers is a classic. Laurie turns out to be Michael's sister (see H2) and that is the reason he stalks her. This flim is loved by both fans &amp; movie critics as a staple of horror culture and a truely gripping film. While it doesn't feature much blood, it suceeds on terms of true suspense and shocks. Halloween is an awesome film, the absolute BEST of the horror genre. It should be in any movie fans collection. I also recommend the excellent &quot;Halloween II&quot;.

B000002J20|5.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans is one of the greatest musical works ever written. Ignore all of the negative reviews you see about this album. Even Beethoven's symphonies were criticized in the same way when they were performed during his lifetime. Of course, today, they are known as masterpieces. It seems as though people criticize music like this because of their own shortcomings, e.g., their ignorance and lack of understanding of the music and its structure and content, and their lack of patience and attention span. It's a sad reality because these critics often mislead people (*cough* Rolling Stone, Q) into believing something is bad. My advise is to take what they say with a grain of salt and not as gospel. I also advise you to get Tales From Topographic Oceans and listen to it with a clear and open mind. Don't expect to like it or understand it at first. Listen to it repeatedly and you should start to hear things here and there that you like. In time, it will start to come together like a puzzle and make perfect sense. It's a lot of fun because, at that point, you will start to notice things that you hadn't before. So, just give it time. Soon, you will see how foolish these critics really are.
0316666343|4.0|I've looked over many of the reviews on this site, and been shocked by both the ones and the fives. I am no literary critic, but I have certainly read better novels than this--better written, better plotted, more insightful and yet...this was a comforting(in spite of its premise), gentle and uplifting book. It was supposed to be written by a 14 year old and that fit, most of the time. After having lost two younger brothers to accident and to suicide, I can verify that a survivor feels very similiar to those in the book. Yet, life does go on and gradually, the loved one is less on one's mind and the memories less painful. Different family members do react very differently to these tragedies and nothing in this book rang false about the stages or types of grieving that went on from my experience. I agree with those people who felt that the first half of the book surpassed the second and that the book jumped around in time and drifted. It is, however, a very thought -provoking book and not at all superficial, as some claim. If you intend to read the book, I urge you to not treat it as a mystery, crime novel or religious tome. It is none of these things, but is certainly worth at least a look.

B000002LVB|4.0|So... what to do after recording three of the most daring and prescient collections of music in history? If you're Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, you sell out, switch record companies, write an album of songs that have nothing to do with drugs, sex or Jesus, and then break up your band. <br />Of course, it could never be that simple. I think that the jangly, \\"Who Loves the Sun\\" sounds enough like a pessimistic take on The Fabs' \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" to give weight to the theory that perhaps Lou was subtly mocking mainstream music with this album. Regardless, there remains a stunning set of songs here that definitely sound more like outstanding Lou Reed solo songs than VU songs. <br />\\"Cool It Down\\" is an appopriately low-key smooth-flavour lounge-blues throwaway. \\"New Age\\" is a slow-burning ballad about mild obsession and the despair of an aging celebrity that could be almost autobiographical, but the line \\"I'll come running to you\\" ultimately cuts through any bad vibes in this song. The cheesily anthemic \\"Head Held High\\", Elvis-esque 50's love song homage \\"I Found a Reason\\" and the rest of the songs that make up the midsection of this album aren't especially distinguished. But it's still fun to hear the VU dabble in country on \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\".<br />The album caps off with the stunning \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\" which sounds like something the VU picked up while they were touring out West. Doug Yule sings some of Lou Reed's saddest, most affecting character sketches, and the song culminates in a slow-burn jam that wouldn't be half as listenable if not for the presence of Sterling Morrison's guitar. It's basically \\"Sister Ray\\" but with rain and tears instead of heroin and murder.<br />\\"Rock and Roll\\"? Well, unquestionably it's an excellent song, but it's available in much better form played in concert (freshly penned, and with THE VU drummer Moe Tucker on the low end) on both \\"Live: 1969\\" and \\"The Quine Tapes\\". While the rejection of consumerism as a means of happiness is certainly something to be applauded (\\"Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars?/Well they ain't gonna help you at all\\"), the song's message of \\"ignore the world's problems and crank up the rock\\" seems eerily like Henley-esque. But, whatever. It's a classic. That just sort of bugs me. Morrison's at top form on the gee-tars here. <br />And, of course, the best for last: \\"Sweet Jane\\". The finest pop song ever written, for my money. Where Lou takes the lessons learned from \\"Sister Ray\\" (the power of one chord, over and over) and applies it to pop. This song about the healing power of music (any music), and of course, love, to smooth over the cracks in the workaday life. Ah, forget it. Trying to describe this song in words is a futile exercise. It gives me chills, it is so perfect. I have a very short list of songs that can do that. After you hear it, you'll know that life has a meaning. <br />So, an uneven album, sure. Without \\"Sweet Jane\\" it'd get three. But you've gotta figure the best song in history earns an album an extra star. Good job, Lou.
B00000633U|5.0|I prefer the \\"rock side\\" of Richard Marx to the more recent R & B style he turned to in the mid-'90s. That being said, this is probably his best album--with a wonderful variety of rock and pop.<br />The opening track, \\"Nothin You Can Do About It\\", is a crunching rocker which I actually heard briefly on rock radio way back when--proving that Marx was once about more than ballads. Equally as catchy is the second track, the lead single and #1 hit \\"Satisfied\\". Then comes another big hit, the beautiful yet still somewhat rock-based \\"Angelia\\". Gorgeous song.<br />Everyone who reviews Richard Marx's greatest hits album says it is an absolutely complete collection. I disagree for one reason: the top 20 hit \\"Too Late To Say Goodbye\\", which is the fourth song on this album, was not included. This song is a gorgeous, powerful anthem which to me is one of Marx's best singles ever. At the end of that song comes a soft instrumental that leads right in to the all-time famous ballad \\"Right Here Waiting\\".<br />From that point until the last track, the album is filled with non-hit rockers which are all good to great. \\"Heart On The Line\\" and \\"If You Don't Want My Love\\" are great, while the haunting, rocking \\"Wait For The Sunrise\\" is exceptional. That song to me is truly the best of Richard Marx--a fantastic rocker. Then comes that last track, the also-incredible \\"Children Of The Night\\". This song has a touching, heartfelt message not to mention melodic, anthemic sound. Beautiful way to end the album.<br />Along with certain \\"pop metal\\" albums, this album represents the epitome of why \\"'80s music\\" was so great and fun to listen to. A nearly perfect blend of the best of melodic pop and rock music of that era. I bought this album when it first came out (just months before I turned 20 years old) and still love it to this day.

B00003CXXI|4.0|Shrek is on of a long line of growing computer animated movies that began with Toy Story. Each movie becomes more realistic. The characters almost look like real people and animals. The story centers around an outcast Ogre who finds his swamp being invaded by fairtale creatures. These fairytale creatures have been evicted by an evil ruler lord Farquaad. Lord Farquaad decides to get a wife. He chooses the lovely Princess Fiona. But Princess Fiona is held prisoner by a fierce dragon. Shrek the Ogre is sent on a quest with his donkey sidekick voiced to perfection by Eddie Murphy. In return he wants to get his swamp back.<br />Shrek basically pokes fun at the fairy tale gender. One funny scene is when Lord Farquaad tortures the gingerbread man (who sounds a lot like Mr. Bill of Saturday Night Live).Eddie Murphy was his hysterical best as the voice of the donkey. <br />The basic message of this movie is that one must not judge a person by his or her appearance. The quality of the animation is amazing. Each movie is more realistic. Final Fantasy and Disney's Dinosuars are the nmost realistic to date. Computer 3D modeling and animation is a rapidly growing field. There are many software programs on the market. Some are very expensive but, a few are reasonable and are quite good ...

Part of the beauty of the old Stones was that their records were a little bit rough, standing in sharp contrast to the whistle-clean songs of the Beatles.  Maybe they should just hire George Martin from here on out.

B000056NX5|2.0|As a recent convert (no pun intended) to \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" fandom, I looked forward to the 2000 version with only slight reservation. Truth be told, the only real reservation I had was the knowledge that, unlike the 1973 motion picture, the 2000 version (based on a recent London stage revival) was shot entirely on video. That in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that directors Gale Edwards and Nick Morris utilized clever cinematography to give the stage production a very cinematic feel. Unfortunately, that's about where the pleasant surprises ended for me. Apart from occasional standout performances delivered by supporting cast members, \\"Jesus Christ Superstar 2000\\" suffers seriously in comparison with its superlative 1973 predecessor. Glenn Carter (Jesus) and Jerome Pradon (Judas) have the difficult task of filling the incredibly big shoes of Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson in the original motion picture. Carter, who looks like he could be the possible offspring of Peter Fonda and the lead singer from that awful 80s hairspray band White Lion, has a fine voice which may have served him better if he'd attempted to find his own range rather than attempting to re-create Neeley's. Pradon has the most difficult job of the two, in my opinion, and although I give the man points for the guts it must have required to take on a role so brilliantly portrayed by Anderson in 1973, his chiseled good looks and powerful voice are simply not enough to make anyone forget the fact that somewhere in America, muddled in the obscurity of bit parts, there exists a 57-year-old man that rightfully should have become a superstar of stage and screen. Even the beautiful, vocally gifted Renee Castle (Mary Magdalene), despite her best efforts, pales in comparison with the genuinely moving and captivating performance of Yvonne Elliman as the original Magdalene. In addition the musical interpretations, although superior in sound quality to what you'll find on the dvd of the original motion picture, fall short. But it's not all bad news about \\"Jesus Christ Superstar 2000\\", for it succeeds wonderfully on one level: it makes you want to race out and buy yourself a copy of the original movie, which stands as one of the few motion picture musical masterpieces of the latter 20th century.motion picture, fall short.

0790737345|2.0|Not really a \\"date film\\" unless you have a date with lifelong celibacy, this chintzy remake of the lovely <i>Wings of Desire</i> plays like a bitter Gnostic parody of the original, in which the bumbling servant of an incompetent demiurge (played by Nicholas Cage with a kind of monosyllabic breathlessness,) gives up eternal life and the music of the sunset in order to participate in one of the most annoying sex scenes ever committed to film. After the indulgence (tacky in itself, but particularly grating when compared to the original film's treatment of the same event,) the occasion of his fall (the improbable Meg Ryan, as a heart surgeon with a peculiarly pointless straw-fiancee,) wastes no time in getting herself mowed down by a lumber truck. Our ex-angel then tries to convince himself that it was all worth it, as the audience is bombarded with evidence to the contrary. <br />Creepily mechanistic plot devices and schlocky dialogue further contribute to the pain-- and it's an awful lot of pain to go through just to confirm the same sad half-truths about the tragedy of human embodiment. Watch it with the one you love, just before you break the news of your decision to enter religious orders.
0789423952|5.0|Mr. Des Pawson's HANDBOOK OF KNOTS is an intelligent compendium of the most practical and used knots to be found on a construction site, camping ground, sailing ship, or diver's barge.  Mr. Pawson demonstrates both his wisdom and practical expertise in its design as the book is compact and slim enough to slide into the pocket of one's coveralls or overalls and easily withdrawn with one hand as you hang on aloft with the other.  If the book were made totally waterproof then it could not be more improved upon for those miserable rainy days at the docks or out in the harbor.  This very useful book ought to be found in every prudent riggers tool bag.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Many call it the best film ever, and I disagree with that only because I don't think there is any one best film.  But in the realm of perfectly executed movies, this baby is in the short list, for sure. The story is believable, the characters interesting and played with great energy by the actors, the plot is up there with the best GReek and Shakespearean tragedies, and the filming - Wow! - what can one say about the filming other than that it is pure artistry? Every camera angle, every actor positioning, every light, all thought out seriously by Welles for dramatic and symbolic pointing.<br />This is one of my favorite movies because it does everything well - plot, acting, filming, and creative and symbolic use of placement of people and objects. This is one to own.
B00004KD1A|5.0|I saw Rory in E. Lansing also, at the State Theatre.  He was about 90 minutes late getting on-stage.  The crowd was pretty ... off, since our buzz was wearing off.  Right before he came on-stage, the MC announced the reason for the delay.  Someone stole most of his PC equipment.  Anyway, Rory and his band came out, and without saying anything about the theft of his equiptment, went right into \\"Messin With The Kid\\".  For the next 90 minutes we were all on out feet, cheering this tremendous guitarist, singer, and songwriter.  This concert is still the best live experience I have had.  If you enjoy blues-based rock you must check out Rory Gallagher. We all miss him.
0871137380|4.0|This is a terrific account of a US military engagement in the third world.  The action starts seemingly with the opening paragraph and it continues throughout the book.  It is the story of a battle seen through the eyes of the troops on the ground (with an occassional look from the helicopters).  My initial reaction was to appreciate not having to go through a number of chapters methodically setting the stage for the action.  Later I found I would have liked a bit more background to better understand how we got to this stage in our Somalian misadventure.  I'm one of the many who thought we were still feeding the hungry when I heard about this engagement.  The author's brief summation left me wanting a bit more.  However, his moment by moment recount of the battle kept me gripping the edge of my seat (and I  had seen the movie first).  In many combat histories we can tell who isn't going to make it because they're the ones we get little background information on.  In this book we get to know all of the soldiers and are emotionally involved with the losses in their ranks.  Yet their losses are surprizingly minimal given the overwhelming odds they faced.  This is an interesting view of the abilities of well-trained, well-armed brave men facing large numbers of poorly-trained, disorganized enemies.  It is a view that Americans will gain reassurance from as our troops may find themselves engaged in battle in the months to come.  Hopefully, though, they won't find themselves caught surrounded like they were in Mogadishu.  This is a timely book and should be read by all who have even a passing interest in the immediate future activities of our military.  It should also be read by those who would like to appreciate the quality of men in our armed services and the sacrifices they recently made.  They're ready to make them again.
0553269631|5.0|This 1940 novel by Carson McCullers is set in a small southern town.  It's about five different people and their relationships to each other.  There is surface structure inasmuch as the chapters move back and forth, focusing on one character and then another and moving the action forward.  But there's an appealing off-center feeling to it all, as this study in what it means to be a human being reflects the human condition without having to tie it all up in a neat little package.<br />Driving the story is John Singer, a deaf mute.  When his friend Sprios, a fellow deaf mute, goes insane, John Singer attracts other alienated people, who pour their hearts out to him, believing that he understands everything.  There's Jake, who drinks hard, requires constant stimulation of his senses to feel alive, and views the world though a communist philosophy.  There's Dr. Copeland, a black physician, who so wants to improve the condition of his race, that he has driven his wife and children away because they never fit the picture of the way he wanted them to be.  There's Mick, the adolescent girl, introspective and intuitive, who dreams of a future filled with music and travel.  And then there is Biff, the owner of the Caf&eacute;, who collects old newspapers and tries to make sense out of what is going on around him.  Everyone feels that the deaf-mute has some sort of magical presence.  But yet, he too, proves to be very human.<br />The town itself is important to the story, and Ms. McCullers' makes use of the rhythms of the seasons and of music to bring the reader right there.  The coming-of-age of the adolescent made me sad and the realities of racism caused me to cringe in horror. The alienation is deeply frustrating.  This is exemplified by one very moving scene where two men debate how to handle injustices.  Both men want the same things, but yet they talk past each other, each demanding that the other must follow a certain prescribed ideology.<br />Each character is restricted by limitations. Each one has desires.  And each one has his or her desires crushed.  How each one reacts and how this interaction affects everyone else is the essence of the story.  The author's skill pulls it all together masterfully.  It's a disturbing book as it tugs at that chord of isolation that exists in all of us.  And yet, it is a wonderful read.  I highly recommend it.y limitations. Each one has desires.  And each one has his or her desires crushed.

6305499365|5.0|This is a movie that can 'speak' to you!  Some movies you watch, and you enjoy them.... some movies you watch, and they become a part of you because you can associate with the characters, their situtations, and how they feel.  That accurately describes Office Space.<BR>To be a bit cruel, the concept for this movie came from a short animated clip done by Mike Judge (of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill fame).  It was well received, and converted into a full length film.  Because of those beginnings, some times this movie feels a bit like 3 stories pasted together and they made up one continuous 'thread' to tie the plots together.<br />Notice that this doesn't hurt my rating of the video at all!<br />I find I associate with Peter Gibbon's hatred of working in a cubicle, the need to just 'get away' from it all.  Of wanting to do things for yourself in life.  This movie, unwittingly, ends up describing ME and how I feel about my life!<br />There's one line in the movie, after Peter skips work all weekend, he wanders into work late on Monday to get his address book.  His best friend explains that he's in a lot of hot water, and what has he been doing?<BR>Peter replies &quot;I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything I imagined it could be&quot;.<br />Amen.
B000066744|2.0|Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but I was utterly disappointed.<br />With such a compelling premise (a supremely gifted pianist born on a ship who becomes an agoraphobe), so much could have been done in terms of character and story development.  With a highly-regarded Tornatore directing the likes of Tim Roth,  I thought this would have been a slam dunk.<br />First of all, the script could have gone through another revision.  While the dialogue sequences in the end with the two central characters were well-written, I cringed so many times for the first 3/4 of the film.  The dialogue was stunted, awkward and contrived (think Steven Segal does heart-wrenching drama).  Also, having the world stop in awe as a narrative device whenever Tim Roth's character played the piano and/or Vince's character tell stories about him seemed a bit much.  The awe and empathy is for the audiences to decide, not the supporting cast.  Perhaps something was lost in the Italian-English translation.<br />Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince were perhaps miscast.   While empathy for the characters is vitally important for the story to be effective, both actors seemed to try too hard, which results in contrivance, and left me not caring at all.  Though Roth and Vince are good character actors (esp. Roth), maybe it's the direction from Tornatore.  It's forgivable to have a bit of melodrama, but it gets a little annoying when you're hit over the head with it over and over throughout the film.  I like to be SHOWN, not TOLD, how to feel for these characters.<br />The Rachmaninoff-style music, while well composed, got overbearing, especially the orchestral soundtrack.  A more subdued and subtle use of the soundtrack would have made a lot of the scenes less melodramatic and sappy (especially for characters you don't really care about).   Varying the music stylistically may have helped.  The music plays an important role in the story, which makes it even more important how it's used as a narrative device- &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; are examples of music-centric films that are effective in balancing music as backstory and music as narrative device.<br />Speaking of music - as in any storytelling medium, the central character should be more interesting than the music.  If Tornatore had focused more on developing a narrative around Roth's character (i.e. his childhood on the ship), and used the music as more of a backdrop, I bet that it would have made it a more interesting film.<br />The pacing of the film was a bit off.  Perhaps it was due to the studio chopping off chunks of the film (originally 160 minutes) and squishing it down to two hours.  The cinematography was good though.  Kudos to the DP.<br />I'm giving it one star for a promising premise, and another star to give it a benefit of a doubt that I may marginally like it more on a different day.
0805062971|5.0|So, _Fight Club_ the movie comes out.  I think, \\"Ooh, that looks cool!  It has fighting and stuff!\\"  Then I read Michael Wilmington's review, and see that there is much, much more to the movie than just fighting.  I think, \\"I should read the book first.\\"  Long story short, Chuck Palahniuk is a god among men.<br />_Fight Club_ the novel is not only a brilliantly crafted narrative (which is, believe it or not, an understatement), it's a bone-shattering foray into the unloved counterculture of alienated male Gen-Xers.  They hold jobs requiring minimal skill.  They buy things the media makes them think they need.  Their lives are slipping further and further away every day.  And they're pissed.  Palahniuk, a la John Steinbeck with _ The Grapes of Wrath_, has found this overlooked segment of society, and written a masterful account if it.<br />The problem I have with writing glowing reviews is that I fear I'm building the book/movie/album up too much and only setting the potential buyer up for disappointment.  So, as always, go into this book as you would any other book.  <br />Just remember that my 51-year-old father liked _Fight Club_ almost as much as I did.

B000006NPY|5.0|Is it possible for an album to be better than the Smashing Pumpkins' masterpiece _Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness_? <br />Apparently. And Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, with _Adore_, has pulled it off, composing not only a brilliant album of soft, emotional songs, but an album for the ages.<br />From the lilting guitar picking of &quot;To Sheila,&quot; to the crashing electronica of &quot;Ava Adore,&quot; from the sad intimacy of &quot;Annie-Dog,&quot; to the gentle grandness of &quot;Behold!The Night Mare!&quot; the album flows through songs that range in sound, yet sound similar all at once. As if this is the last desperate plea from a lost romantic, ready to jump off a cliff.  Cheesiness aside, the album's sixteen songs, like a good baseball team, each bring an individual strength to the overall composition.  Here lies another example of an album being greater than the sum of its parts; and when the sum of its parts already makes the greatest album ever, you know you've really got something.<br />Say what you will, Billy Corgan's musical genius is unparalleled. _Adore_ proves it.
B000060MWU|5.0|Ok let me get this out of the way first, yes the dvd is godawful i know, so my rating is going all to the movie, all im saying is just buy it and bite the bullet until the American release dvd comes out (in April of next year is what im told). Now on to the film, it is a complete masterpeice! i have no clue why this movie is as underrated as it is,i was up late one night about 2 years ago watching it on the IFC channel, and the only word i could muster after it went off was &quot;whoa&quot;. This movie has to be the most atmospheric and disturbing Lynch film ever, and im willing to back that up. You have for instance, 75% of the movie which is in either pure darkness or weird growing shadows, you have a rich creepy score,many kewl/trippy songs, awesome performances by the whole cast, has to be my favorite Bill Pullman role to date, and you know that weird blurry-jittery camera zoom  you saw in Mulholland dr.? Well that was originated here first, not to bad mouth Mulholland dr. ( my second favorite Lynch movie) im just giving credit where it's due. Good scares, and just many things about this noir-horror drama that makes it a cult favorite. And why this film wasnt nominated for cinematogrpahy is beyond me, So to sum it up. a trippy TRIPPY thriller that needs many veiwings to understand completly. I havent said much about the plot becuase i dont want to ruin anything, but if you've heard about this movie and havent seen it and want to buy the dvd, trust me the less you know about this movie the better.
B000002534|4.0|I've owned this title for over 20 years now.When I read Santana<BR>bios they always mention this release as a commercial failure.<BR>I thought I was some  kind of weirdo because this was  one of my favorite Santana releases.

B000002L80|4.0|The big party's over, the folks are giving their thanks and leaving, and it's time to pick up and start clean.<br />And a mighty fine job they do of it.<br />It's amazing how much Talking Heads developed in ten years. From the quirky, frighteningly tense early art-punk to strange, abstract dimensions of experimentalism--though the Heads always pushed the envelopes--and funky African beats with layers of synth. <BR> With 'Little Creatures,' the experiment seems to have ended, and the music is back to the basics--but not quite the roots (like their punkier stuff). David Byrne no longer seems so nervous. Of course, he's still off-center--name one other singer who says \\"I've seen sex, and I think it's alright...\\" with a straight face--but he's separated his quirk from twitch. It's light, and definitely more accessable than, say, \\"Fear of Music,\\"--but not a sell-out. If you listen closely, Byrne may sometimes sound tired--and rightfully so. After years of heavy-duty performance, these guys deserve a break. (All four weren't to perform together again after the Stop Making Sense tour, but that's another story.) The songs, as implied, are laid-back. \\"And She Was\\" is a fun little song to tap your foot to; \\"The Lady Don't Mind\\" can get downright infectious, and, of course, there's the cute \\"Stay Up Late,\\" a song so light that most critics missed the idea of the Heads taking a day off. Check out the Rolling Stone's review--I don't know where the hell they got that idea from. \\"Road to Nowhere\\" has this (I remember reading this somewhere--it's not all mine) cheery look to the apocalypse--almost like, as the other source said--Prince's \\"1999\\". Except more hummable and less dance-worthy. It also hints at some of the stuff \\"True Stories\\" would be made of.<br />Those looking for more cerebral, experimental stuff may be disappointed with this--to them, I suggest picking up a Jerry Harrison vinyl instead. But anyone looking for a head-bobbing, relaxing(!) Talking Heads tune--this mustbe the place. (ha!)
0345404475|1.0|I've a moderate tolerance for flat-footed prose, but I didn't get far with this before I had to give it up. Possibly it has compensating virtues: I don't care.<br />Apparently the consensus about Theodore Dreiser, by the bye, is something like this:<br />&quot;Dreiser is not a particularly good writer. His sentences can be clunky, truncated and fragmented. His language is stilted and awkward at times. He has no ear for writing dialogue. But these technical limitations are more than offset by Dreiser's incredible insight into the interior lives of his characters.&quot;<br />Still I'd be very surprised (I've not read him) to find his novels nearly as badly written as &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (It seems to me, for that matter, that prose approaches poetry when it is especially felicitous, not when it is especially awkward and inept.)
B00005Y228|5.0|\\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" proved that Kylie Minogue was firmly placed in the grips of Euro-pop and new-age disco, after meshing the formulas together on 2000's 'Light Years' and revitalizing her career to staggering new heights. 'Fever' works much in the same way as 'Years', yet it focuses more on peppy melodies and experiments further with disco-fied techno. A few of the cuts, such as \\"Love At First Sight\\" and of course \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" almost take a quick wink at French disco-house wizards Daft Punk. Kylie has a tendency to do that- sound almost like someone else yet putting enough sex and sass in it to entirely call it her own. The sex and sass are felt in other ditties as \\"More, More, More\\", \\"Give It To Me\\", and \\"Fever\\", but her true heart is shown in the \\"dance ballads\\"- \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Come Into My World\\". The energy races back up after this however with the thumping house grooves of \\"In Your Eyes\\" and the Donna Summer-esque \\"Burning Up\\". Kylie's material has never been thought of as forward-thinking, but she clearly knows how to work best when given a couple juicy dance beats and a sexy croon to wash the melodies in.
B00005JKDR|4.0|You know how a dressing gown hanging on the back of your door can look like someone standing there?  Or how a noise in the night sounds like a monster tip-toeing down the hall?  Kids get scared and call in their parents: there's something in the closet, Daddy!  But what if there really were?<br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a look at the other side of the closet door, in Pixar's finest animation.  What you'll find through that door is a whole civilization of monsters, who scare children for a living; and one particular monster, James P. Sullivan, brilliantly voiced by John Goodman, who has a run-in with a little girl.  Billy Crystal plays Mike Wazowski, the comic sidekick -- the guy who looks like a one-eyed green soccer ball with arms and legs on the DVD cover; Sullivan is the purplish hairy thing behind him.  They work in a scream factory -- hey, what do you think monsters do all day?  The girl is a toddler, barely verbal, and cute as a bug, and she's the center of some of the funniest action scenes in the movie.<br />There's not a lot to say about the plot, except that it supports some great action and some pretty good comedy work.  Crystal does a fine job, but Goodman's deadpan delivery is even better -- his \\"slumber party\\" line was my favourite of the movie.  The slapstick is up to the standard you'd expect, and there are even a couple of lines aimed at the adults that the kids may not quite catch.<br />In many ways the movie is designed to appeal to a Daddy/daughter combination more than anything else; there's a definite tinge of \\"what will I do when my little girl grows up and leaves me?\\" to the movie.  I don't want to give anything away, but Dads should watch this with their six year old girls snuggled up next to them.<br />The only reason I haven't given it five stars is that although it's fun, beautifully-animated, and very well voiced, I don't think it quite has that spark that makes an animated feature a long-term classic, the way some of the best Disney moviesare.  It's not a musical, by the way -- there's not a song in it.  But if it isn't the best Disney have ever produced, it does have panache, style, and a sense of humour.  You'll enjoy it, and so will your kid.

Afterwards you know you have been near the source of sun and light.  I am thankful for those like Carlos Santana who can translate it for we mortals.  Doubt me?  Try Bella, Now that You Know and Blues for Salvador.  There are some weaker moments on the CD, but just those three take you all the way to eternity.

Supposedly this song was the inspiration for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;.<BR>PPS (and this only works with the vynil) if you play &quot;Revolution 9&quot; while moving the platter around at different speeds with your finger, it sounds twice as weird.
076781326X|5.0|What a performance, music, cinematography.  Actors are living the roles.  Children are acting as well as the adults if not better.  Great, just great.
B00006879E|5.0|take it from someone who is a devoted hater of boy bands--this group is AMAZING! this cd is totally alive and wonderful. their sound reminds me a bit of dexter freebish. i am completely impressed. pop songs with real grooves and actual lyrics?! is it too good to be true? nope, it's Maroon 5. you definitely need to buy this cd.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I enjoyed the &quot;Rock In Rio&quot; double live album, and I was equally excited that this DVD was coming.  I bought it (15 bucks at Best Buy for a Double-DVD was a BARGAIN) and enjoyed practically every minute of it.  The sound and visual quality was nothing less than superb.  Some of the songs were even better than the original recordings, such as &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name,&quot; &quot;Fear of the Dark,&quot; &quot;Brave New World,&quot; among others.  The only thing I miss about this DVD and the album is that they didn't redo any song from the Somewhere in Time album... oh well.  Maybe they'll do more in the future.  Long live Iron Maiden!
B00006690G|1.0|Well, here we go again. Another Eminem CD. Anything new to expect?. Anything good?. Of course not. This is Eminem. The guy is a one trick pony. He took what made him controversial on the last CD and just re-does it again. Same old garbage. His talents are excruciatingly low, and his voice is one that can cause migraines bad enough to make your head explode. He doesn't do anything. Nada. Zip. Zilch. What untalented person can't write songs and make fun of people in it?. There is not a single thing he does that some nobody off the street couldn't do. Eminem is mad?. What a surprise. Eminem curses?. Shocking!. Eminem attacks good, respectable people?. Gee, he's never done that before. The only thing this nobody is good at is pushing the buttons and getting himself attention. It shouldn't be hard to do since he just does the same thing over and over again. He tries to sing on \\"Hallie's Song\\", but can't. At least he is trying to show people he can sing. Sadly, he can't. It's excruciating to try to listen to him try to think that he has any vocal talent at all. Em, you don't. Don't even try. One person even said he cut out the swearing on the song and called him a great dad. Oh brother. Yeah, really great. Eminem is the kind of artist with a short shelf life. You think dreck like this will go on for 10, 15 years?. No. There is a spot waiting for Eminem at the Washed Up Talentless Home right next to M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice.
0142002038|1.0|I don't know how Ian Fleming got his reputation as a good writer, as this book is simply awful. The worst thing about it is the writing, which seems as though Fleming got no education on how to write well. He will go on and on and on and on about the tiniest detail, so that when he finally finishes, you forget what's going on. Mind you, there are lots of other things about this book that make it stink like rotten poultry. Take my advice: don't even bother borrowing it from the library!

0515123447|2.0|The book is very well written. Well at least for the first few pages. The idea is pretty good: J. Reacher visits a village and get's arrested for murder which he didn't commited. I do believe some people think it is an interesting read but for me it was just to unrealistic. I mean an ex-military policeman who can fight everybody and finds every clue was for me a little too herotic. A person this perfect gives me a lack of suspense. 2 stars
B0000696I1|4.0|Arguably not the best of the series, TMNT III does have its charms.  Even though it did not contain my favorite turtle villian, the Shredder, it still was an entertaining plot that offered the same things as the first two films.  A welcome feature of this film is the reprisal of Elias Koteas' role of Casey Jones, who, despite his job of basically baby-sitting Splinter, still has his trademark attitude.
6305736650|5.0|One of the best love stories of the twentieth century. This was originally just a low budget film produced by Warner Bros in the 1940's, and wasn't expected to do too well at the box office.<BR>    This is the one film that Humphrey Bogart starred in with Ingrid Bergman, but together they light up the screen like no other screen couple has since. He is Rick Blane, he owns a nightspot in Casablanca called Rick's Cafe ( the original title of this movie was 'Everybody Comes To Rick's'). Rick spends most of his time running his saloon, or sitting in the dark drinking bourbon and dreaming of memories past. Into all of this comes Ilsa Lundt, a woman he fell in love with in Paris, but who mysteriously stood him up at the train station when they had planned to elope. <BR>Rick has never laid eyes on her since that day when his insides had been kicked out, but here she is again in the company of Victor Lazlo, a freedom fighter considered an enemy of the Nazis. And they have come to Casablanca seeking safe passage to America, and Rick may be the only one who can help. But will he let his feelings for Ilsa (feelings he has long denied having)interfere with what is best for the woman he loves?<BR>This is a standout classic not just for some of it's lines \\"We'll always have Paris\\", or Dooley Wilson's dulcet tones crooning 'As Time Goes By' just for the two star crossed love birds. But also for the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman who lights up the screen each time she walks on, or for the brooding Humphrey Bogart as he cries into his bourbon for his torn heart. This film will certainly prove that sometimes you just have to let love go, that sometimes even though it feels right, you just have to say \\"We'll always have (fill in the blank)' A film not to be missed.
6302293553|5.0|To be honest with you, I was never a big fan of the Flying Circus when it was on TV, but this had to be one of the most inspired bits of tomfoolery committed to film! Between \\"Naughty, evil, wicked Zut!\\", the taunting of Sir Robin by one of his own minstrels, the Black Knight that refuses to give up even after Arthur chops off all of his extremities and various other sight and word gags too numerous to mention, anybody with a good sense of the absurd will love this movie! It's a classic and deservedly so, joined in general quality by the uproarious \\"Life Of Brian\\"! However, the Pythons couldn't keep it up beyond \\"Life Of Brian', and you'll notice they pretty much broke up after the miserable \\"Meaning Of Life\\", only making cameos in Gilliam's movies afterwards.<br />Enjoy the first TRULY funny effort by the crazy Pythons!

0553103547|5.0|This book is not a happy one. Actually, I can't really remember whether this particular book is happy because I read the other two as soon as I finished the first, and if you read \\"A Game of Thrones\\", you'll jump for the sequels (\\"A Clash of Kings\\", \\"A Storm of Swords\\") as well.<br />Back to the title of this review: \\"Perfection of Imperfection\\". How many books have you read that left characters truely unhappy? Eddings lost the seer's bodyguard, McCaffrey lost the guy on the blue dragon. I figure I should have been touched around then, but, quite simply, in most fantasy series, the people who die or have horrible things happen to them simply aren't important enough. The last author to come close to what Martin does was Tolkien in the Shire (for risk of spoiling things for those who have had an interest in the books sparked by the movie, I'm not going to be specific).<br />Martin is perfectly willing to do more than sacrifice characters. In this book, as I was waiting for a character to be beheaded, I kept wondering, how are they going to save him from this? It seemed impossible. And I guess it was. Tough luck.<br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is just the beginning to about 2500+ pages of betrayal, war, and dirty tactics, with incest thrown in just for fun (ok, not for fun, it sets off the whole revolution thing). There are a large handful of self-proclaimed kings of the land (named the Seven Kingdoms, but nobody will even think about just splitting them up). Each has their own devious little webs to spin, each has a likable character and despicable character on their side, so you never feel quite secure in rooting for a particular group. Good and bad are not so clearly defined in Martin's works.<br />Then there are the characters themselves. Cersei and Jaime Lannister remind one of Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia (although their old man, the strict Lord Tywin, would never take Rodrigo's place in the rumors). But the two are balanced by their deformed, dwarf brother, Tyrion (I think that's his name, anyway), who tries to do things for the good of the people. Sansa and Arya Stark seem to be two opposites: gentle lady versus wild woodsey fighter girl. Dany, exiled daughter of an ousted king who plans to take back her family's kingdom, seems to be the median between the two: gentle but also firm and dedicated to her cause. Robb Stark, firmly raised by his noble father, Ned, is the antithema to Prince Joffrey, Queen Cersei's spoiled, willful brat. And Jon Snow, ... half-brother of Robb, has this calm within sort of personality that explodes when convenient to the story.<br />The sad part of all this is that so many of theses characters and more die in this book and the next two.<br />While there is no gratuitous violence, Cersei and Jaime make this book frankly inappropriate. In other words, it would make a great movie, but it would be R if they didn't cut certain scenes.<br />If you're looking for a fantasy series where the good guys aren't clear, every side takes violent hits, and the world is not perfect, I suggest you pick up this book.ink that's his name, anyway), who tries to do things for the good of the people.

0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha was perhaps one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  It goes deep into the roots of eastern religion with poetry, grace, insight, and wisdom.  In its pages perhaps you will find the meaning of life, perhaps not.  In any event, you will read a great novel.<br />It is the story of Siddhartha, the son of a Brahmin.  Early on Siddhartha leaves home with his friend Govinda to search for the meaning of life.  Like the Buddha he studies meditation and practices austere aceticism in an endeavor to win liberation and experience moksha, or enlightenment as it is called here in the west.<br />He gains several mental powers but always enlightenment remains just beyond his reach.  So he and Govinda leave the Samanas of the mountains and caves.<br />On their journey back to society they encounter The Historic Buddha, the original founder of the Buddhist faith.  They are both impressed with his holiness and Govinda decides to become a follower, however, Siddhartha, because of his astute intelect, finds a flaw in The Buddha's doctrine.<br />So he meets with him in a bamboo grove under the light of the moon and expresses his thoughts to The Buddha.  The Buddha in turn acknowledges Siddhartha's intelegence but also cautions him to beware of his own cleverness.  What it comes down to is that The Buddha sees the intelect as an obstacle, while Siddhartha sees all religious teachings as provisional, for to his mind he knows The Buddha is enlightened.  But he has also ascertained that enlightenment is an experience and that this experience must be experienced directly for oneself, for it is beyond the power of words... Words are useful to convey concepts and ideas, but enlightenment is a transcendent reality that is beyond the power of words to describe.  Even The Buddha said:  I am merely a finger pointing to the moon, don't mistake my finger for the moon.<br />Siddhartha then goes on to leave Govinda behind and re-enter the world, where he meets Kamala, a beautiful prostitute, and eventually he forgets his quest for wisdom, and immerses himself in sex, money, gambling and other mundane pursuits that eventually bring him to a state of nausea - possibly the same kind of nausea that Gautama Buddha experienced the night he left his Palace and exchanged his royal clothes for the rags of a beggar.<br />I could go on telling you more and more about this wonderful book.  But the sacred river where Siddhartha hears the sacred sounds will tell you infinitely more.  You simply have to read the book and listen for yourself.ostitute, and eventually he forgets his quest for wisdom, and immerses himself in sex, money, gambling and other mundane pursuits that eventually bring him to a state of nausea - possibly the same kind of nausea that Gautama Buddha experienced the night he left his Palace and exchanged his royal clothes for the rags of a beggar.<br />I could go on telling you more and more about this wonderful book.

0385505833|5.0|I read Skipping Christmas last November and while I wrote my review then, never got around to posting it.  Must have been the holidays that interfered.  In any event, as the days of summer dwindle down and thoughts turn to school beginning and cool weather, I thought this might be an appropriate time to remember what's around the corner.<br />As November turns to December who hasn't thought about skipping the holidays, whatever they may celebrate.  The very thought of shopping, sending cards, wrapping presents, cooking, baking and then entertaining is cause an anxiety attack even for the calmest of people.  Is it any wonder, then, that when I saw this book I just had to read it.  Now before you laugh at the name of the author, better known for legal thrillers, allow me to say this is an entertaining title and a perfect read before the holidays.<br />With their daughter off to Peru to serve in the Peace Corps, and Luther Krank figuring just how much they spent on Christmas last year, he makes the decision to skip Christmas.  At first his wife, Nora can't imagine forgoing the rituals and traditions of Christmas.  But when Luther proposes a cruise instead, Nora is only too happy to think of sun and surf instead of snow and shopping.  At first their decision seems to only affect the Kranks, but soon their neighbors and community observe they are skipping Christmas and now the Kranks must explain their decision which their friends and neighbors.  And when the Luther and Nora's circumstances change and these events unfold, Grisham has the perfect opportunity to send his readers a message about the true meaning of friendships and the real spirit of the holidays.  For as we all know it's the people in our lives that really count more than the gifts, decorations and food.<br />This is a worthwhile and most enjoyable read.  Just right to spend a few hours with when you're bedraggled from the holidays and start thinking about \\"Skipping Christmas.\\"
B00005B36H|5.0|Before I bought this awesome album i was not a big tool fan nor had i heard of them such. but one day during the beginning of this summer, i heard parabola on the radio and fell in love with it. the cd cost me [item price] since it was a bit old and not of sale anymore, but after listening to it the price ment nothing. at first i didnt listen to the album that much, but after listening to the whole album through and through i fell in love with it. my favorite tracks in order are 7&6 together, 9, 3, 11, and 5. these songs are awesome because they all have soft and hard rock spots. all the other songs are sweet too, expect for the fillers and 13 (very random). now i love tool and want to buy another one of their albums. buy this album if you are new to tool like i once was, you will be amazed by it!
B00005MM01|4.0|This double album is split down the middle.   Electric/jazz/60's psychadelic fans will enjoy the first part immensely.  For me, the first part is just \\"ok\\".  My problem is with some of the outdated keyboard sounds (not Donovan's fault though) and it sounds too 60-ish (ie, mid era Beatles (1965-1966)) for my tastes.   Not my cup of tea (I grew up in the 70's rather than in the 60's) but that does not mean others won't love that part.  The instruments give it an outdated sound as well.  Never-the-less, the melodies and creativity of those selections are supurb.   For me, the album REALLY shines in the last part (ie, the last 11 songs) which is primary accoustical guitar numbers with soundscapes leading into the next selection.   These 11 songs are timeless and perhaps the most enjoyable set of contigous accoustical guitar numbers I have ever heard on an album.  Each song seems to get better and better with the final buildup to the best song on the album (the last one).  Highlights \\"Isle of Islay\\", \\"Widow with a Shawl\\", \\"Lullaby of the Spring\\", \\"Starfish on the Toast\\", and of-course, the last track.  These songs alone never get tiring and make the whole album worth while.   Being a hobbyiest with the accoustic guitar (in no way, shape or form do I consider myself good), I especially like these songs as they're simple enough and fun to play along to.  <br />If you like the 2nd half of this album, I'd like to also add the following recommendations of bands to check out:  Pentangle, Bread Love and Dreams (an incredibe British band from the late 60's/early 70's (consist of 2 female singers, 1 male singer, and ALL 3 of them play accoustic guitar together and have incredible melodies every bit as good as all songs on the 2nd half of this Donovan album and all 3 of their albums from 69, 70 and 71 are folk rock classics to low and behold) NOT to be confused with the soft rock band Bread), Trader Horne, Magna Carta (especially Seasons), Nick Drake, etc...

B000066F6H|5.0|In the wasteland that followed the Nova of the grunge movement people have endured a long period of music that includes sloppily played and produced 'alternative/metal' music as well as sappily sung and produced boy bands.  Talent has had, until now, little to do with it, but rather with marketing and force-feeding the mindless masses.  The Hives are a promising beginning to what I hope is the end of the Great Music Depression.  Veni Vidi Viscious is a suprisingly original,catchy, strong,sincere discovery I recently made.  The vocals are intriguiging and compelling, as are the lyrics and band.  I also enjoy (@work) the enhanced videos of the CD.  Nice touch! In short, they're a good, solid group.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith is the best female performer on the music scene.  I became amazed by her when I got the 8 track tape (really) Radio Etheopia and saw her on Saturday Night Live when I was about 12.  <br />I rediscovered her about 7 years ago and haven't let go.  This disc, Horses is by far my favorite - great lyrics and tremendous pent up frustration.  If you think she's Patty Smyth, forget it, you're head will explode, but if you know Patti Smith, and don't have this one, get it now.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Very enjoyable film. A well done comedy as well as an entertaining commentary about modern life. Another very good adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel (see also \\"Fever Pitch\\" and \\"High Fidelity\\"). Hugh Grant is brilliant as Will, and it is a refreshing change from many of his previous movie roles. I prefer watching him play the handsome cad rather than the bumbling nice guy (v.boring).

I also recommend the follow-up and Helen Fielding's first book &quot;Cause Celeb.&quot;  Not to mention that earlier work &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice.&quot;  Mark Darcy/Mr. Darcy...Ding-Dong.
0790734060|5.0|\\"Amadeus\\" is not rated R, it's rated PG. Don't believe me? Check elsewhere. Why in the world would you put R? There is very little adult situations, little violence, and little language. Believe me movie fnas. It's rated PG. The following is an edition to this review. Now, I understand why the rating change came to be. The Director's Cut has 20 minutes of new footage which contains nudity. Why did Milos Forman decide to put a deleted dirty scene back into a great picture. Because of that the whole MPAA rating changed. If you love this movie, and you are unhappy with the new director's cut, buy the original theatrical release. I own that one and not the director's cut(Thank God). For a minute there I got scared and thought they just changed the rating for the fun of it. You'll be happier with the original. I predict a plunge in the sales of the director's cut.
B000068TPN|5.0|Firstly, this war movie is a little different from the rest which I have seen so far. It has a very good mixture of action as well as psychological effects of war, which is missing in most of the war movies like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down.<br />The movie did start with the actions (the French in Indo-China). However, later into the show, it concentrated on the effects of war, not only on the soldiers themselves, but on their loved ones and countrymen. I loved the part whereby Hal Moore's (Mel Gibson) wife dispatched the telegrams of the sacrificed solders to their family members. The effect has a tremendous impact on me, as I am also a reserved soldier in my country who needs to report to camp annually for training. I am acting as a solder, a father, a brother and a civilian at the same time, just like all of them in the show. This mixed feeling is not easy to describe if one is not in our shoes.<br />Secondly, the action part of the movie is not compromised as well. It is so action-packed during second part that my eyes stayed glued to the show for the entire 2 hours. The makeup for the soldiers was very realistic. Sound effects was incredible. Choppers and planes zooming pass, bullets swishing everywhere. Everything was projected crystal clear on my 5.1 surround sound speakers.<br />Lastly, I would urge war movie-goers to get it. Worth every cent of it, simply because it contains not only actions, but more importantly, the foolishness and cruelty of war, as well as the sufferings of everyone that is in it directly or indirectly.
B00005U2LM|4.0|When I first heard it I wasnt impressed but on a few listens of this cd I realised what a quality piece of work it is.  RZA production is tight as always and beats are bangin.  WU has not fallen off, its only because people are stuck on the stage they were on in the past and refuse to see how much they have grown as individuals and as a group.  The only thing I dont like about this CD is the occasional use of some R&amp;B hooks in the song and the use of too much trumpets and other brass instruments but beside that its tight!
B000035P7X|1.0|I am not a hardcore Dylan fan. I want to be upfront about that. I watched this last night with a friend that is a hardcore Dylan fan.

Not good.
1878424319|1.0|I was in college when the big name evangelists were being toppled for tax evasion and sexual mischief.  My friends and I were going to start a religion, because it was clear that if you held unusual beliefs and paraded them around, you'd get rich and famous.  That's what this guy has done.  Bottom line: he believes that everything we've learned is a lie, and that everyone's motivation is based in fear.  If that's for you, and you don't have a mind of your own, I guess this your kind of book.  But if you're a free thinker, and believe more in the goodness of mankind, and a belief system that is positive instead of negative, you'll stay as far away from this guy as you can.
B00000099Y|1.0|Throw up your hands.<BR>Why do I keep coming back here? To check up on my least favorite child, the one who acts weird and dresses goth because he thinks it makes him different. <BR>1) Deep, intelligent lyrics? This ain't Sylvia Plath folks, it's not even Weezer. Tool has no more depth than the typical moaning nu metal radio band. Well, not much more. Tool ARE better than Staind, but that doesn't mean much. Consider this: the words are all ponderous fugues minus wit, insight or real intelligence. (Use of big words is not a genuine sign of intelligence, but is more often a sign of pretension or overreach.) And through all this senseless grime, they can't even write a rhyme. The Swedish dudes who write for Backstreet can.<BR>2)People often mistake length for creativity and &quot;goodness.&quot; These people have not seen Liz Taylor's &quot;Cleopatra.&quot; Remember that the longest Best Picture nominee wins 44% of the time. Compare this statistic to some of the winners of the last few years. Music is viewed this same way. Tool is always very long-winded, and it's surprising how little musical content is contained in their 80-minute headaches.<BR>3)What a lark: &quot;instrumental ability.&quot; Bands that are &quot;dumb,&quot; i.e. Red Hot Chili Peppers and Primus, or even Metallica,  could play circles around the guys in Tool. Guitar-boy Adam Jones often claims in interviews to be a bad musician (see, it's not just  modesty) and the other two are nothing special. None are as weak a link as MJ, though. Based on his work with A Perfect Circle, I'd say that he CAN sing, so I guess that he chooses not to here. Anthony Kiedis sounds better on the latest RHCP album.<BR>I suppose there are folks who think that Trent Reznor's &quot;God is dead and no one cares&quot; lyrics are good, too. Maynard's anti-God sentiments in the liner notes are hilarious compared with his obvious lyrical fascination with the subject.<br />So, let's bring on the one-star reviews! Come on, you all know that you can't stand this record and you were manipulated into buying it. You know you can't stand this band's smirking, superior attitude and their elevator-metal adulteration of everything Ozzy fought for. You know their &quot;artistic&quot; (read: pretentious) videos and murky excursions are not your cup of tea. <BR>Aaaaaahhhhhh; nothing feels better than telling the truth.

I guess that's a good thing.

The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because I would have liked to have had a more pleasent view of what heaven was like for her.  I think if Sebold was going to place her in heaven she should have given us a little more visual AND maybe for our own reasons ... some hope that heaven is everything we are taught it will be.  Then, on the other hand, heaven may be thought of differently by others and that is what she conveyed.<br />This book gave me a lot to think about.  It's strange how this book came out at a time when we have had so many children, especially little girls abducted and/or murdered.  I can only hope that from heaven these children can guide us and those who protect us to find these awful people that commit such heinous crimes.<br />I noticed in some of the comments that some people think this book is about God because it refers to heaven.  When really this book is about a life taken to early. The way the book is written ... I got so enthrolled in the girls thoughts that I thought they were my own thoughts.<br />I like knowing that (even if it just a story) those in heaven can still follow us throughout our lives.  BUT, then, it saddens me that some souls can be unsettled ... at least until their murders are found.  Very interesting plot.  I would definetely recommend this book.  I think if is carefully scripted it would make a great movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|I first heard Pearl Jam when i was 6 or 7, i had found a tape, it was the album Ten, I put it in our tape player that barely worked and i sat and listened, before i knew it i had listened to the tape 8 or 9 times, i was in sheer awwe, when you are 7 years old you arent usually a big fan of music. It was so beautiful, i of course did not understand some of it but as the years went on i bean to understand the album, I later bought their album VS which was another musical triumph. The absolutely intriguing and stunning lyrics combined with the beautiful vocals and powerful music made for what i think to be the greatest band of all time. Vitalogy was a frighteningly good album except for foxymophandlemamma tahts me, i havent gotten myself to listen to the whole thing because its frightenning. Now for my favorite Pearl Jam album, many say it is their least favorite, No Code inspired me to write poetry and songs, Their was such a wide variety of music in that album, ranging from teh heavy punk sound of lukin, to bluesy red mosquito, and the tribal in my tree. When yield came out and i heard given to fly it was so amazing, Mike did a fantastic job with the music, and Eddies lyrics were once again brilliant, when i heard evolution i said to myself wow this song needs a video!, and sure enough what came out was the greatest video of all time, about something i believe in deeply and praise pearl jam for taht song...now for binaural, my favorite pearl jam song is Grievance...it means so many things but not enough people see what it means...i am an aspiring musician, im a song writer and a poet, im also quite heavy into drawing and painting, i play guitar, bass, and anyhting with strings, also any percussion...my real passion is singing and writing...
B000060K4O|5.0|I personally don't like the way people give out five star ratings on Amazon.com.  It is for this reason that I try to give a perfect score to something that truely earns it.  Out of all the DVDs I own, I can't think of a single movie that earns the five star rating more than Ghostbusters does.  I'm going to skip reviewing the movie, simply because as most know, it's a classic.  The movie alone deserves a five.  This review will be focused on the DVD.<br />Video:  In the 18 years of this movie's existance, this is by far the best print you'll ever find.  The movie is presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  There is no pixalation, no edge enhancement that I noticed, and no dirt on the print itself.  It looks so good, you would never think the movie came out in 1984.<br />Audio:  Again, this is the best the movie has sounded in 18 years.  While it can't compete with new movies like Star Wars: Episode 1 that truely take advantage of 5.1 surround, it sounds reasonable good, considering how old it is.  The music is crystal clear, as is the dialog.  My only real complaint is the sound effects.  Certain sound effects, such as the proton guns and explosions, aren't as dinamic as I would have liked, and they could have used more bass.<br />Extras:  This is where the disc really shines.  The audio commentary is easily the most entertaing commentary I have ever heard.  There are three featurettes:  one from 1984, which is very good;  one from 1999, which is merely average; and a special effects featurette, which is also very good.  There are ten deleated scenes, all of which are different from the ones that appeared on the Criterion lazerdisc.  The scenes range from OK to just plain bad.  It's easy to see why they were removed.  There is a storyboard to film comparison, as well as a before-and-after special effects comparison.  There are four trailors:  Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Stripes, and Groundhog Day.  The GB trailor is pretty good, while the GB II trailoris pretty awful.  Another interesting feature that makes a nice companion to the commentary is tricks and trivia.  Taken from the 1985 book, Making Ghostbusters, little subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, providing facts about the scene.  Finally, there is concept art for all the films characters, key events, and the logo.  This DVD is three years old, but it can still hold its own extras wise.<br />I can't recommend this DVD enough.  The video, sound, and extras are all excellent.  Add to that the price, which is extremely low for a DVD of this quality, and you have a must own DVD.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I bought this dvd without having seen it in theaters.  I had heard enough good word-of-mouth to feel confident that I would enjoy it.  Thankfully, I was not disappointed.  This huge cast of characters is thoroughly interesting and the director did a magnificent job with this film.  As usual, I'm totally impressed with Maggie Smith, who always gives her best in each project.  This dvd has some nice extras and well worth adding to your dvd collection.  Ryan Phillipe does a nice job, especially along side of a group of veteran British actors--a daunting task but he succeeds none-the-less.  I recommend this film highly.  Very entertaining!
0790729628|5.0|And unlike many films that get the &quot;Classic&quot; label, this one's actually worth watching, again and again. Unlike anything else before or since, this film -- Scott's best together with his other great Sci-Fi effort Alien -- exists in a world of its own, a gritty, pulpy melange of dispirit elements that come together, but not cleanly, and for that it has a realism, in spite of its hard-boiled detective lead, that is missing from other Sci-Fi classics such as The Matrix. Incredible. Not to be missed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I just bought &quot;Room for Squares&quot; and I'm glad to report it is an excellent cd.  John Mayer has the good looks of a pop star but his songs are smart and immediately likeable.  I had heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot; on the radio and liked it but I wondered if the rest of the cd would be any good.  After hearing the next single, &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, I knew then that I should buy the cd.  Along with the two previously mentioned songs, I also like &quot;83&quot; and &quot;Love Song to No One&quot;, to mention a few of my favorites.  After hearing this collection of songs, I am eager to hear more from a talented young man that is a very hot commodity.  I recently tried to get tickets for his concert here in  my home town and unfortuantely it was sold out!! Oh well, I'll just have to sit back and turn on the cd player.  I highly recommend this cd.
B0000640VO|5.0|There's the old movie paradox, courtesy of Matt Groening:<br />1. French films are funny.<BR>2. Sex films are funny.<BR>3. Comedies are, of course, funny.<BR>Yet: No French sex comedies are funny.<br />Perhaps Amelie succeeds because it isn't a sex comedy, but rather an endearing film with an incredible sense of humor, that winds up focusing on a romance, but only as the culmination of a film that is about personality and relationships. Sounds awful -- I wouldn't see it based on my own review -- but it isn't. It's carried off in the best way possible. Ten minutes into it you'll be saying \\"Only a Frenchman could have made this film,\\" only you'll be shouting it over your own laughter and the laughter of everyone watching it with you. Wonderful, exceptional film that comes along only once in a great long while, a hilarious comedy in its own right, and a bonus touching romance -- all carried off by the unforgettable, inimitable Amelie. You'll fall in love with her yourself.

B00000AFGM|5.0|\\"Mechanical Animals\\" is an absolute classic. Not only is it radically different from \\"Antichrist Superstar,\\" but it marks <BR>an emotional rebirth for Manson and his band of creatures. Manson had said in interviews that MA was supposed to make fun of the typical rock star lifestyle, and how he used it to poke fun at himself. Heavily influenced by David Bowie's <BR>Ziggy Stardust persona, Marilyn Manson's Omega character was <BR>an exaggerated version of the 70's glam rocker while at the <BR>same time bore the qualities of an androgenous alien from outer space. Of course he wasn't literally a martian, but an outcast created by society's manipulative institutions (Christianity included). <BR>As the middle part of the trilogy started by ACS <BR>and concluded by Holywood, MA recalled how Brian Warner lived <BR>as Marilyn Manson 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and willfully indulged every rock star temptation brought before him. <BR>\\"The Dope Show\\" and \\"Fundamentally Lonesome\\" were songs about drugs. <BR>\\"User Friendly\\" clearly told how a rock star gets plenty of <BR>sex, but never has a permanent relationship. \\"New Model 15\\" mocks popular magazines, such as Cosmopolitan, Spin and <BR>Rolling Stones, all of which Omega appeared on the covers. Manson, as Omega, savored so many drugs and so much sex and shallow publicity that in the end he didn't know how to feel emotions anymore; what was left of him was a hollow shell of his former self. In his existence, he paid a heavy price in becoming what Heritage Christian School did not want him to be. <BR>No doubt he was gravely aware of how many of the biggest rock legends suffered the consequences resulting from their own indulgences, ending up with either depression, AIDS, lawsuits, bankrupcy or just plain lonliness. Realizing that society made him who he is, Omega became the Antichrist not to entertain the fans, but to destroy the very thing he created. <BR>MA is part-two of Manson's grand rock opera, <BR>and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone old enough to buy music.
0140143505|5.0|I've always known booklovers were special people and this slender volume speaks of that eloquently.   Amid the quaint and quirky book orders, fascinating in all their diversity and antiquity (wouldn't you just love to have Frank and Helene over for dinner?), the kindness, compassion, and just plain love for one's fellow humans sparkles like the gem this small tome resembles.  Whenever I start to lose faith with the other b'zillion travelers on this planet, I return to this book, and others like it, and that faith is reaffirmed.  A blessed, joyous, unsurpassed reading pleasure.
B000001Y2U|5.0|\\"Antichrist Superstar\\" not only put Marilyn Manson into the center of controversy, but it's also indeed the lightning bolt that struck the rock industry. Acting as both the beginning and end of a 3-part autobiographical tragedy that continued years later with Mechanical Animals and Holywood, ACS allows Manson to decry the traumas he suffered in his childhood, most notably the years he was forced to spend nearly brainwashed by Heritage Christian School. \\"The Beautiful People,\\" was about how the little boy inside him, Brian Warner, was repeatedly harassed <BR>and assauted by his classmates, humiliated by the teachers and treated like a nobody. \\"Kinderfeld,\\" which by the way used to be titled \\"Smells like Children,\\" told how Brian's late Grandfather Jack Warner used to hide an enormous collection of pornography in his basement. In these 2 songs alone, one can understand how Manson's sexual desires AND his values of right and wrong were warped so extremely that his realization of it was almost hysterical. <BR>Throughout the record, Manson compared himself to a worm <BR>(a caterpiller rather) wrapping himself up inside a chrisalys and painfully spreading its wings. At the same time, however, the lyrics of some of his songs were heavily inspired by the Book of Revelations, which told how the Antichrist rose to world domination, tricked his followers into believing that he was God, and in the end used that power to destroy every living thing around him...everything in the very same society he hated and despised. The title track \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" is accompanied by a brutal chanting that to some resembles that of the Nazis or Fascists. The following track \\"1996\\" is where Manson (in his iron rule) declares war upon all who attempted to beat him down. I could go on and on about ACS, but the point is, it's a rock opera that music buyers must not ignore.
0971855110|4.0|The only reason that I don't give this book 5 stars is... you don't really need to buy it, and I feel slighly \\"taken\\" for thinking that it would have new information.  The whole FlyLady system is easily accessible at her website - [...] - which has been widely publicized in magazines and on TV talk-shows, so I am not breaking a secret here!  I haven't found anything in the book that isn't somewhere on the website (though having it in written, easy-to-find form is nice, I have to admit).<br />The important thing here, whether you use the book or the web, is that the system is easy to follow - with \\"baby-steps\\" and short time committment (15 minutes a day!) - and it WORKS, if you do it.  Even if you don't do everything, that organized, focused 15 minutes is enough to make a difference in your home.  Cilley spells out clearly what steps to take in what order, so you don't get too overwhelmed and can make housecleaning routine.
6301966015|5.0|\\"Blow Up\\" was a sensation when it was released in 1966. Critics and moviegoers hotly debated its enigmatic story. Three and a half decades later, its meaning is no clearer. I have seen it several times, and I remain clueless. The movie has fallen into relative obscurity, and, so, the few people I've met who have seen it have been unable to offer any satisfactory insights. If you are looking for pop entertainment, you certainly want to avoid this one because the plot is so puzzling. <br />Why, you may ask, do I rank it so highly? It's because it is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. Every single shot is composed with the utmost care. The framing is amazing. The colors are beautiful. The sound, too, is meticulously constructed. Although the sound technology back then was primitive compared to today's, the movie manages to make background noises very much a part of the whole. <br />The story revolves around a bored but brilliant London photographer, played by David Hemmings. He is a genius at his craft, but his life is an empty place. One day he wanders into a lovely park, where he spies two lovers. He follows them and photographs them. The girl [Vanessa Redgrave] sees him and demands he give her the film. He refuses. When he develops the photos, he sees a blurred image, which, when blown up, looks like it might be a body. He also blows up an images that looks like a hand holding a gun. He has accidentally photographed a murder. Or has he? The girl finds his studio. She seduces him. He pretends to give her the negatives, but later finds his studio has been vandalized. By the girl? By an accomplice? And for what reason? Who will believe him? Or is there anything to believe? It's left to the viewer to supply the answers. <br />The lively and unusual music tracks are by jazz great Herbie Hancock. The movie was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, an Italian. To the best of my knowledge, his only other English language film is \\"Zabriskie Point\\" [1970]. His Italian films include \\"La Notte\\" [1960], \\"The Eclipse\\" [1962] and \\"Red Desert\\" [1964]. Brian De Palma's 1981 movie, \\"Blow Out\\" was inspired by \\"Blowup\\". <br />Highly recommended to those who believe movies can be an art form.
B000001FQQ|1.0|Kiss spent most of the late 80's insisting they were a band with a viable future and resisting every temptation to be branded a nostalgia act. And with the success of records like 'Lick It Up' and 'Animalize' they were doing a good job of driving their point home. But 'Crazy Nights' didn't sit just right with fans and the new tracks on the 'Smashes, Thrashes and Hits' best of compilation ('Let's Put the X in Sex and 'You Make Me Rock Hard') were simply dreadful output, corny, juvenille and closer to the one-note crotch rock of Warrant and Poison.<br />Then, with all eyes on them to deliver the goods, Kiss delivered their weakest record of all with 'Hot in the Shade.' While their hype machine kept pushing that this was 15 new tracks and no oldies but goodies, no record made this fan pine more for Kiss' back catalogue than this one. Aside from Paul's strong 'Hide Your Heart' most of this record is a forgettable mash of 80's pop metal, delivered by a band that had lost its personality somehow. <br />This is neither a metal album nor a pop record. It has no voice, the songs have neither charm nor attitude. Sadly, the band was firing on no cylinders with this one. Eric Carr's singing debut in 'Little Caesar' is as weak an effort as the band has ever put forth, not that Gene's 'Prisoner of Love' fares much better. Not even Paul Stanley can carry this album. His 'Rise To It,' 'King of Hearts' and 'Silver Spoon' all pass without notice. His 'You Love Me To Hate You' would be a good lost song if the record were better, but it could hardly be considered any sort of lost classic. He and Michael Bolton's 'Forever' is a fine enough power ballad but, again, it just gets lost in the sea of late 80's power ballads coming from hard rock bands.<br />The upside to 'Hot in the Shade?' If nothing else, the dead response to this record is what got Kiss to realize it was important to more strongly reflect their entire musical catalogue in concert as their slacking 14 song concerts on previous tours were finally replaced with 20-plus tune evenings that hit on the band's infamous past more squarely. <br />If the seeds of the eventual reunion were sown on this record, it was a desperation move at best. This record killed 'new Kiss' far more than the departure of Ace Frehley or Peter Criss ever could have.<br />But, it was also good to learn later, Kiss would get their 'Revenge,' next time out!
B00005JL1C|5.0|This movie is the best!

WATZ played by Marie Stuart Masterson is what makes this movie! This is the perfect 80's love triangle movie even better than The Breakfast Club which is another great movie! IF YOU HAVEN'T seen this movie you are missing out!! <BR>FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
B00004T9VY|5.0|Tea for the Tillerman is the must have cat stevens. Once you get it and get a taste of his music you will want to get some others as well. I own only Tea for the Tillerman,Best of and Greatest Hits and I feel like that is about all the Cat Stevens that is strictly neccesary.  If you have cash to sling around then pick up Mona Bone Jacon and Teaser and the Firecat and you will really be in Cat Stevens heaven. Bhudda and the Chocolate Box and some of his releases as Yusuf Islam are also OK, but I would deem them unneccesary if you own the above three albums.  They will provide tons of listening pleasure and are an essential addition to a varied collecion of Pop music.  Stevens was unique but not in an annoying enya/bjork kind of way. Any music fan will be able to appreciate Cat Stevens, and in my opinion he is more essential to a music collection than even, say, a Bob Dylan, if not even the Beatles. Ok, so maybe not the Beatles, but he is a somewhat overlooked hit machine who never sold out and has produced some of the sweetest music of the last three decades or so.
B0000071J0|5.0|What is it with these hairy Italians? Is it the garlic bread, the spaghetti or the spicya meatballes? Whatever it is, it makes for some exiting listening. This one you can play over and over, it wears really well. Those drums are just awe inspiring, and the keyboard effects are still ahead of OUR time. This just left me with my jaw on the floor, salivating.
0440236304|5.0|I got ahold of an old tattered copy of this book when I was 14, and it made quite an impression.  Since then, books like \\"The things they carried\\"(Vietnam) and \\"The Longest Day\\" have joined this one on my shelf.  Without question it is well and viscerally written, with an honesty that is almost tender at times.  My first impression of the book at such an inquisitive age may influence this opintion, but it is still my favorite war book.  This edition is excellent, with an introduction and photos, although I bought a used copy of the original edition  just for the sake of nostalgia.  Anyone who appreciates human drama will enjoy this book.
0316666343|5.0|I'm not at all religious--and not usually what I would call \\"sentimental,\\" either. The premise of The Lovely Bones should have been enough to put me off--narrated from Heaven, as a dead girl looks down upon her family, disentegrating below her. Hasn't that child-murdered-family-torn-apart plot been done to death? (No pun intended). Yes, it has. This book is the exception, though. The matter-of-factness of Susie Salmon's voice, opening the book with \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6th, 1973,\\" keeps the book grounded and out of schmaltz. At the same time, it's profoundly sad; I suggest you keep a box of tissues near you while you're reading it. I felt that parts of the ending were rather manufactured, and some of the prose became bogged down in the author's grasping for gorgeous metaphors--but most of the time she succeeds in grabbing them, and the final few pages make up for any overly fantastical elements that snuck in earlier. If you're going to read a book that's being hyped, take my advice and pick this one: it's actually worth all the chatter about it.
B0000025DR|5.0|Some music becomes intertwined with books.  For me, this album and Michael Crighton's Andromeda Strain cannot be separated.  Nowadays, you cannot spin the record backwards to hear the famous words &quot;the music is reversible but time is not.  Turn back, turn back&quot; which is buried in the first track of this classic. My personal favorites are the songs that were not hits like One Summer Dream and Down Home Town.  These tunes are a bit more funky, give them a try.
0930289455|5.0|The Killing Joke is one book that nobody should avoid reading.  I would say that Batman is the secondary character in this book, for the main highlight of this book is Joker.  In particular, his origin and how he transformed into the psycotic criminal that he exists now as Batman's arch nemesis.  Let this be a warning though: Joker's origin in this is nothing like how it is in the animated series or in Tim Burton's movies.  It is much more emotionally graphic and mature.  I wont detail it here, as it must be read first hand to be believed.  Without spoiling this book, I'll try to summarize this story's main theme in a nutshell:  Batman and Joker were just once two ordinary people who just went to the opposite ends of a single curve after one bad day changed their way of viewing the world.  As a result, they became each other's arch nemesis and are perhaps the most closely related characters in the Batman universe.  The arch nemesis bond that this book shows is one that is very hard to emulate, even by works of English literature.  Batman's \\"bad day\\" is witnessing the murder of his parents, while the \\"bad day\\" that made Joker a homicidal psycopath (read this book, and you will see that he is the epitomy of a psycopath) are the consequences that ultimately led to him seeing life as a pointless struggle against unconquerable odds - in a word, a joke.  If my little summary left you confused, read the book, in particular, the final confrontation at the end and it will all make sense.  I also strongly recommend reading Frank Miller's excellent The Dark Knight Returns, as it intricately shows how Bruce Wayne's \\"bad day\\" created Batman - not the super hero with the fancy gadgets and skills, but the essence of the character that sets him apart in the Comic Book universe.  Reading it will surely make my summary above make sense.  The level of excellence that the Killing Joke encases to provoke an analysis that I have written above shows that this is not some regular comic book - its a piece of true literature.  Read it - you will not regret it.
6302409365|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant camp classic. The characters are charming and memorable, especially the understated Morticia, the swashbuckling Gomez, the stone-faced Wednesday and the villain, Dr Greta Penterschloss. The double entendres and ironic lines have since become part of the vocab of lovers of the Addams Family movies. Other interesting characters include the helpful \\"Thing,\\" the weird butler and Fester, of course, while at the family ball Cousin It and the twins Flora and Fauna really impressed. The funniest scenes include the school play, the s&eacute;ance, the first visit of Fester to the vaults (where they watch an old home movie) and the psychotherapy session: \\"love, hate, hate, love - ze thoughts they bubble und collide.\\" I have made a habit of watching this one at least once a year. It's a timeless classic, with great gags, excellent acting and a culture of its own. No wonder it has become a cult classic.
0792101448|1.0|Where oh where do I start?  First off...this is a MESS of a movie!  Director Leone knows TWO shots in this film...close up and REEEEALLY CLOSE UP!  I watched this film on TV with my family when I was around 12 and we ALL laughed our heads off during the screening.  Everytime there was a supposed dramatic moment, that GOD AWFUL music would chime in!  And what's with casting Henry Fonda as the villain?!  I thought at any moment the aging star's TEETH were gonna fall out onto the dusky plains of Italy!  Lemme try to put this gently...this movie STINKS!  Extreme close ups, BOMBBASTIC music and ENDLESS scenes sans dialogue DO NOT a classic make!
B000000H6D|5.0|Say what you will about Type O Negative, \\"Bloody Kisses\\" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and Type O's defining masterpiece.  I first caught wind of this album after hearing \\"Black No. 1\\" on the radio (it seems like that was forever ago) and I loved it instantly, it was that classic chorus that hooked me in: \\"Loving you was like loving the dead\\".  While that song is a masterpiece in its' own right, \\"Christian Woman\\" and the eleven minute title track are epic dirges.  \\"Kill All the White People\\" changes the mood around and is just plain hilarious and recalls the days of Type O's punkish past.  \\"Blood & Fire\\" is my personal favorite, everything about that song means so much to me, and it has one of my favorite lines from a song ever that I can relate to: \\"Of all the women I've ever known, they're not you, I'd rather be alone...\\".  Peter Steele and co. really did create an epic masterpiece that is truly underrated (then again, Type O is quite an underrated band).  \\"Bloody Kisses\\" helped me through a lot of tough times in my life, and for anyone and everyone who has ever felt remorse, loss, or heartbreak should dive head first into this album.  A true masterpiece.
B00004TWZF|4.0|This is one of those rare cases where I believe the American version is much better than the European. I could do without some of the superfluous scenes such as the oil rig scene....It just doesn't fit. While Eric Serra's score is haunting and beautiful I feel that Bill Conte's score is more appropriate for the content. And the European ending does not settle as well as the American version.....Jean-Marc Barr swimming into the distance.  WHERE'S THE AMERICAN VERSION ON DVD??????? The Professional/Leon is available in the American and European version on DVD???
0679731377|5.0|One of the most challenging pieces of fiction I have ever encountered, A History Of the World ranks amoung the few works i can reccomend unequivically to anyone interested in... well interested in anyting actually.  If you're an avid reader these 300 odd pages will stand out from other writing in their brilliant depth of insight and the remarkable compassion and understanding they express towards the human situation.  If you're merely a cognigent human being I implore you to let Barnes guide you through the big issues of what life on earth has meant over the last 5 or 6 millenia.<br />When I say this book is genious, please don't interpret that to mean it's one of those fictional works you'll read straight through i a couple blissful hours.  Although i'm sure it's possible to be affected by it in such a way, i wouldn't suggest such an approach to it's subjects.  Take your time on this one; read it over a week or two and digest each chapter like an individual course to some magnificent courtly meal.  Trust me, as the major themes come together you'll revel in the ways Barnes fits his salad and dessert chapters together for a delighfully complimentary meal with real value.  Each chapter could easily exist on its own as a serious and compelling entity, but the real beauty of the work is the comprehensive message of it's 10 and 1/2 chapters.<br />Barnes chooses the story of Noah's ark as the point departure for his fiction.  Narrated by a stowaway woodworm, this intitial chapter takes a very different perspective of that historic journey.  Later chapters range in sbject from a hostile terrorist hijacking to an imagined nuclear holcaust; from a treatise on the beauty of human love to a parting vision of a now democratic heaven.

B000000H3Z|5.0|I listen ot alot of heavy, speed and death metal so this cd was an excellent compilation for me. It sounds great the heavy riffs and the solos. Plus Max's voice is a great feature to the cd for me. All the tracks are good. If you like, Slipknot, Six Feet Under, Cannibal Corpse, Soulfly, Vader, Living Sacrifice, or Most any other heavy or death metal band you love this cd. First time i listened to them was with a friend and we were at a party and the three of us hurt for the next three days from the headbanging so it's really heavy.
055321277X|4.0|The tale of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde has been quite familiar to me for as long as I can remember, but only now have I read the original short novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.  It is unfortunate that familiarity has robbed modern readers of the suspense that almost certainly was engendered in Stevenson's contemporary audience.  Nor can I attribute a strong hint of terror in these pages, partly because of the plot structure.  This is not a straightforward story; we don't follow Dr. Jeckyll in his experimentation.  Rather, we are introduced to Jeckyll and Hyde through Jeckyll's lawyer Mr. Utterson.  Having drawn up Jeckyll's will to leave everything to Hyde should he disappear, he is most concerned for his client and friend upon learning that Mr. Hyde is a misshapen monster of a man responsible for trampling a young girl in the street.  The first half of the book follows Utterson's attempts to discover this Mr. Hyde for himself.  The final half of the book contains the story of Jeckyll and Hide, told first in the words of a mutual friend and doctor and ultimately in an account of events penned by the unfortunate Dr. Jeckyll.<br />It goes without saying that the heart of the story revolves around the duality of the human mind.  Each of us has a dark side as well as a good side, and the majority of individuals attempt to disguise any bad, uncontrollable aspects of their natures from the public.  Dr. Jeckyll had a predilection for thoughts and acts which he and society frowned upon (although what these acts were is never revealed); as he neared middle age, his life became defined by a continuous inner struggle to keep on the straight and narrow path.  He often failed, so he came up with the idea of totally separating his evil nature from his good one.  Through the use of chemistry, he developed a solution that, when ingested, transformed him into a different persona in both body and mind, one which had free reign to indulge anonymously in those worldly delights Dr. Jeckyll secretly lusted after.  He thought that his original persona would then be freed of the guilt of his desires, while his Mr. Hyde persona could satiate himself in performing guilty actions without any moral restraint.  As is only natural, the dark side grew stronger as time passed, and the person of Dr. Jeckyll found himself in more of a quandary than he ever dreamed of before giving birth to Mr. Hyde.<br />Inner conflict between the good and bad in ourselves is something every reader can easily understand, and it is this psychological aspect of Stevenson's famous short novel that accounts for the tale's continuing popularity.  It is a quick and absorbing read, but the method of the tale's presentation is a slight weakness in my opinion.  We can only watch the human drama from a third person perspective, and I would like to have gotten more deeply inside the mind of Jeckyll and Hyde.  Still, this is a classic of literature that will retain its place in popular culture for untold years to come.  As for the afterword by Jerome Charyn in the Bantam edition of the book, I must say I could have done without it.  It does provide some interesting background on Stevenson, but its psychological assumptions and surmises struck me as overdramatic and groundless.  The story of Jeckyll and Hyde stands strongly on its own merits and does not need to be accompanied by psychobabble.yll secretly lusted after.

0316666343|5.0|Quite simply, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It was especially poignant to read during this past year, with the kidnappings, rapes, and murders of so many little girls all across our country. It brings the focus back where it belongs: on the pain and horror suffered by victims of violence and our noble, but often inept, system of justice.
0316666343|4.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I love the concept, the writing style, the emotions.  I read it on a soggy, rainy day- just perfect.
B000006045|5.0|I put the Cd in my car and couldn't even go home - I had to drive around and take a road trip to hear it all.  I have had the CD in my car for a week (one of 6, but this one gets played the most) and I can't stop listening to it.<br />All songs peek your interest, all songs are different, but all seem to maintain a flow.  If you've heard songs from other albums by this band, don't think that this one will be the same.  They made a huge change just like FSOL did with their new album.  This is not one of those CDs you end up liking one or two songs on it.  This is a CD you put in when you don't want to use your remote or just want to drive and think in peace.  It's the best I've heard in years.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The best films, regardless if they're for kids or adults, all have the same thing in common--great storytelling, characterizations and imaginative direction. Pixar's Monsters, Inc. has all three in spades. From the film's satirical opening m inutes (with its parody of commericals and corporate America)to its last suspense filled frames, Monsters, Inc. packs humor and heart into a fun filled movie. Director Pete Doctor has crafted a film that entertains whether watched for the first time for the tenth.<br />John Goodman's performance as Sully and Billy Crystal's performance as Mike demonstrate that not all the best acting is found in serious high minded films. Both give comedic performances that rival the best live action work each has done. What's particularly memorable about the film is the imaginative voice casting. Without the right performer, the best animation won't reach an audience. Monsters, Inc. manages to do both exceptionally well. The opening titles (with their witty reference to the old Gerald McBong McBong cartoons)can't even begin to prepare you for the fun that follows.<br />The extras on this 2 DVD set are particularly fun. The animated short about Mike's new car is a blast (it's only found on the video version) and the inside look at Pixar shows us not only who comes up with these nutty ideas but how they give birth to them as well. There's also a section that shows viewers where all the inside jokes are (although I have the sneaking suspicion that there are still a few gems hidden in there somewhere). The Boo game is fun for little ones and the DVD-Rom features are a nice addition as well.<br />The digital picture transfer is spectacular. The widescreen and standard screen formats are both available on the same disc (like with Toy Story 2). It's amazing how detailed the sound effects are on films like this. Viewers could listen to this film and still chuckle.<br />I'd also like to comment on Randy Newman's score. Newman is probably one of the most under rated songwriters/film scorers around. His work on this film (like his best work including his great score for Ragtime) helps accent the action and humor. Newman's sardonic wit is the perfect compliment to Pixar's films.<br /> Monsters, Inc. (like Toy Story before it) has set a new benchmark for animated family films; it's sleek, intelligent and funny managing to reach kids and adults equally well.t under rated songwriters/film scorers around.

B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne's debut effort, \\"Let Go\\", brings a new talent to the forefront of music. The album is fresh and full of raw tracks, clearly detailing the tumultous teen years and expressing the voice of a new generation. While threads of Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, and Pink can be heard, Avril leaves her mark on all of the songs. Sounding older than her young years, there is a definite maturity in her songwriting.    While many of the tracks on the album are full of strength and literally oozing raw energy, there is a softness to Avril's music as well. 'Complicated', the album's first single, is surprisingly mature both in its delivery and lyrics. 'Sk8er Boi' is a Blink-182ish look at the man that got away, performed with both energy and a dash of anger. The second single, 'I'm With You', is both gentle and full of emotion and a raw loneliness unusual for someone so young.    What may make Avril's efforts so poignant, however, is her amazing ability to clearly communicate the tough life of a teenager in a changing world. For instance, 'Anything But Ordinary' deals with the quest for individuality in a clique-driven age. 'My World' both describes Avril's home life while displaying her uncertainty regarding the future -- something all teens can relate to.    At some places, Lavigne sounds almost identical to Crow, Pink, or Morissette. Listening to the lyrics and delivery, however, leaves it obvious that Avril is indeed her own person, emptying herself into every track. It's a promising debut for the young Canadienne.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is an excellent war movie for those of you out there looking for a good one. In my opinion, Mel Gibson was the perfect Colonel Moore for this spectacular Military movie. Colonel Moore is a colonel leading all of the toughest troops in the frontline against the toughest enemy: The North Vietcong. He is also desperate to find the dog tags of his downed fellow soldiers as proof that they were K.I.A. I won't give away any more details, so you can find ot for yourself, war movie fans!
0684853523|5.0|This Stephen King book is a must read for anyone wanting to write.  This is an unusual recommendation from me, for I have never read one of Mr. King's novels. (His work is typically in a genre I avoid) but if \\"On Writing\\" is typical of his work, I may have to try a couple of his books.  Even if you hate King's books, his advice is impossible to ignore, because it is coming from a man who has sold millions of books, so obviously he knows what he is talking about.  About half this book is an autobiography, in which King talks about his life, his problems with alcohol and drugs, and the debt he owes to his wife (and fellow novelist) Tabitha,('Tabby' as he refers to her.)  This takes roughly half the book, and his advice on writing is the other half.(The final chapters deal with his almost fatal accident in '99...) The 'how to write' portion is something like 150 pages but King crams more useful info in those 150 pages than many books of this nature twice as long, and since he IS Stephen King, he makes it stick.  You also get an impression of man who, despite his success, still doesn't take himself too seriously, King defintely has a sense of humor...Wehn speaking of bad books, he says, \\"I should know.  After all I'm the author of \\"Maximum Overdrive.\\" (or words to that effect. the 'Overdrive' book apparently was not one of his better workds, as I said, I haven't read him..)If you want to write, or if you are a Stephen King fan who just wants to know more about your favorite author, you MUST have this book
B00005JKJA|2.0|My wife didn't like it because she couldn't figure it out. The fact is, no one can figure it out, no doubt including David Lynch. The women in this film are great to look at. &quot;Diane&quot; glows from the inside out, and &quot;Rita?&quot; . . . fuhgedaboudit! She'll knock yer sox off. The DVD has no Scene Selection feature, which is a serious oversight IMHO. How hard would that have been to include? The sound is either Dolby Digital (2 channels? 5.1?) or DTS (not on my machine!) . . . your choice. No director's commentary or anything other than a trailer.
B000001DQI|5.0|This album is one of the best pop albums of the seventies.  Elton was at his peak and the band was tight - at least in the studio.  While everyone has heard Candle in the Wind ad nauseum, what many listeners may not realize is that for every hit on this album - title track included - this album features some of the best album oriented pop ever produced.  The Ballad of Danny Bailey, Harmony, Roy Rogers, and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting are the kind of story tunes that draw you in and sparkle with John/Taupin genius.  While many modern albums these days give you one or two hits with a selection of poor to mediocre tunes, every song here is a gem.  If you weren't around in the seventies, pick this up and listen to some of the best white bread pop ever produced.   The re-mastered version actually adds to the experience.  Should be in any serious collection.
B000005DQR|5.0|One of the great things about this truly outstanding album is that hip-hop and non-hip-hop fans alike will enjoy it.  I don't like hip-hop but this album just has something special about it.<br />Nearly every song has a timelessness about it.  Josh Davis's use of samples is just right and is never too pretentious.  One of my particular favourite things about this album is the occasional use of piano.  It sounds great and really adds something to the tracks it's featured on.<br />If you're wondering whether to buy this album or not, because you think you mightn't like it, just go for it.  I thought I wouldn't like it and then I heard it!
B00000DC10|5.0|When I first listened to this CD I was blown away by how hard yet intellegent it was. I can definately hear a little bit of Fugazi mixed with Rage Against the Machine, oddly enough. The difference between this band and other &quot;hard-core&quot; punk bands, or whatever you want to call them, is this band isn't afraid to experiment alittle with different kinds of music and instruments. Almost every song on this album will move you in some way, whether it be stomping your foot or smashing something with a baseball bat. I do believe that this band right now is punk music's best kept secret and maybe its better that way.

B00005QFHG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes stories about independent spirited women, not to mention Johnny Depp!  He was wonderful in this movie, as was everyone else.  The unique characters were delightful and it's a refreshing movie.  This one woman touches so many lives, even the lives of those that try to avoid her.  She changes their lives for the better, whether they wanted it or not!  Just a joy to watch.
B000002KGT|5.0|This is one of the most listenable pop albums ever recorded.  The summer of Star Wars was also the summer of \\"Don't Stop,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way.\\"  Fleetwood Mac, at least the configuration with Nicks and Buckingham, hit their stride with the Rumours album.  They were playing together as a coherent group.  On later efforts it is almost as if they were using each other as back-up musicians - off writing their own songs and pursuing their own interests.  There is a distinct sound, and each song is a memorable pop masterpiece.  When Christine McVie sings \\"Songbird,\\"  she created a musical treasure you can listen to over and over and never get tired of.  <br />Whether you are looking to discover the best of the seventies, or just collecting some of the greatest albums of all time, you'll want to add Rumours to your collection.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|It contains some of their most powerful work.  Made at a time when other electronic producers were only finding their feet, Kraftwerk were in full gear with this release.<br />Any album that has two high quality songs like 'Europe Endless' and 'Hall of Mirrors' back to back, has to be up there with the classics.  Opener 'Europe Endless' with its startlingly beautiful synth motif and gliding hi-hats sounds even better in this day and age.  While 'Hall of Mirrors' is an ambient type track which shows off the often underplayed strength of the vocal talents of the Kraftwerk team.<br />Later we have the highly influential 'Trans Europe Express' which sounds like classical music with electronic rhythms.  It could have come out of a Hitchcock movie.<br />The perfect Kraftwerk album.

B0000640VO|5.0|This is a jewel of a film. At times quirky and sentimental without being mawkish, ~Amelie~ is a cinematic experience which transports the viewer into the lonely but highly imaginative life of a young woman, whose random and conscious acts of kindness changes the destiny of those around her. ~Amelie~ shows us that even little things can cause people to fall in love again, alter their views of themselves and make life worth living.<br />Amelie Powlain (Audrey Tautou) is a beautiful girl living in Paris, who waits tables at a local restaurant, and discovers that pleasure can be found in simple things: skimming stones across water, cracking the top of her Creme Brunee with a spoon, and ultimately taking a genuine interest in the lives of the people around her.<br />The direction of Jeunet and the magical photography of Bruno Delbonnel, creates an otherworldly Paris, a Paris that Parisians knew existed but is now almost forgotten. There's no graffitti on the walls, the charming streets are rubbish free, and the soft hue of that special Parisian light, which is well known to some of us, is captured with subtle intensity. This is truly another world that we can only wish for.<br />It is certain that viewers of this unusual and beguiling film will come away with the feeling that life is about simple pleasures, and kindness, random acts of kindness, can change the destiny of people around us in profound ways.<br />~Amelie~ is nothing less than a five star experience.
B000062XM7|5.0|This is definately one of my favorite films and highly recommend to anyone.  Daniel Day Lewis is at his best here, as is Madeline Stowe.  If you are a fan of the book, you may be disappointed, as this movie does not follow the book like you might like it to, but if you can appreciate it for what it is....a great work of fiction in itself, then this is for you.
B000002572|3.0|...I am no way a fan of corporate rock music but indeed this album works as an allright album. The production is good , the sound and the enginerring is good. they are good musicians and the songs are indeed radio friendly so in my final grade I give this album 3 stars. the reason why I only give it that Well not all the songs on this album are as good as others. Well there arent anything original about the album the lyrics arent very meaningful (they dont always have to be but sometimes i depends on what Kind of music you are listening too) and the album is nowhere near perfect. I was born 9 years after this album was released so you dont have to take my word seriously I just want to say that If you want to have a record collection that has all kinds of good music in it well you should by this (it is not expensive by the way). But if you are only into very strange and original music or really critically aclaimed and hates corporate rock or rock that is usually made for girls or couple in love beware! thanx
B000007R1M|5.0|This really did well in America and it can be seen why.  Having introduced the US to the sound of electronic rhythms with 'Computer World', 'Man Machine' built further on that with its electro basslines and beats which were adopted by many, particularly in the Detroit area.<br />Of all Krfatwerk songs, 'The Model' is probably best known.  It's on here and sounds as fresh as it did back then.  But it's not the only song worth a mention.  'The Robots' is another classic Kraftwerk song with its electro rhythm combing well with its simple melodies.<br />A powerful album of electro pop from the originals.
0060977264|2.0|Lovely beginning on a quest to re-unite with her childhood friend, disappointing to see the quest has been shoved aside only to place the spotlight on some deep religious practices. Horrible ending to see that the deviated religion has stolen the show.<br />I was utterly disappointed by Coelho's work in this book. When I finally finished the book, there was only one thing to say.... Coelho is trying too hard. His style is repetitive, if you have read more than three books of his you will know exactly what I mean.<br />When I first read the back cover of this book I thought I was going to really enjoy the reading, as I love the poetic touch in books. The title itself is soooo poetic, but almost nothing else was in the book. In my opinion, there was too much emphasis of religion in this book. It was not your regular description of religion, it was so very deep and unbelievable. I don't think it would've been this mundane if it weren't for the fact that Coelho was trying to create a whole new interface with god, a different genre in religion, the \\"feminine\\" side. You'd think that he'd describe it in two to maybe ten pages, but it just kept on going and going and going. By the time I finally finished the never-ending book, I didn't even like the ending. By the river piedra she sat and wept for a very ridiculous reason.<br />This was supposed to be a poetic love story about childhood sweethearts. Coelho seemed to have forgotten that along the way.<br />Love and religion don't mix...A description of both in one short book will not work. This story was not a love story it was a story of some religion or some practice that is absolutely absurd. It could've been a beautiful book, as poetic as love can be.<br />Very unfortunate with a moral gone wrong.
0316666343|2.0|I also fell for the hype surrounding this book.  The concept intrigued me, and I have to admit a few early passages in the book brought me to tears, but overall I was greatly disappointed.  <BR>While I truly do appreciate what Sebold was going for in this novel, it was too much of a light read for the subject matter.  The characters were without depth and the concept of \\"heaven\\" was vague at best.  Ruth's endless fascination with Susie's death made little sense.  Sebold gave this character nothing else to do but wander around with some kind of sixth-sense.  The idea that Ray, a boy who had a crush on Susie, and kissed her once, would be carrying a torch for her for 10 years later, is a nice thought, but ridiculous.  Susie's little visit to earth via Ruth's body just about put me over the edge.  <BR>I think that reviewers who praise this book (5 stars???) and its character development probably haven't read much else.  <BR>In Sebold's defense, a nice, tidy ending to the search for Susie's remains would have satisfied a lot of readers, but at least in that respect, she was more realistic.  The grim reality in many of these situations is that there is no closure.

0553277472|2.0|This book was nothing but trouble for me, and perhaps it was because I hadn't expected it to be such a heavy work of philosophy.  There are moments when the book is more of a narrative, but by and large, it's a philosophy book in the guise of fiction.  It's much higher quality than something like The Celestine Prophecy, but not exactly unlike it in the way it wants you to see the world in a different way.    I got 2/3 through it and that's all.  Most people who read this book seem to love it, so my reaction seems to be atypical.  But hey, a reaction is a reaction.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I was shocked by how amazingly good this album was and is. It is very interesting, my favorite track on the album has to be &quot;Take it or Leave it&quot; the only con about this album is that all the tracks are very similiar in rythym, beat length and tone. Other than that I think this is one of the few albums in 2001 that deserves a 5 star rating.

B000003TA4|1.0|thank goodness Nirvana are no longer. Cobain.. Kurt Cobain? Talentless. Cobain started this psuedo - alternative mindless garbage and imitators can still be heard today. This music was made popular by those who can only 'discover' new music by seeing videos on MTV. Nirvana made music without melody popular. He's lucky he aint around today because this ... got old 10 years ago. Nirvana took credit for things that other bands did so much better before them. Bands like The Replacements, Pixies, Clash, Sonic Youth. Nirvana did nothing new. They tried to sound like the Pixies or Westerberg but couldnt even come close.
B00004BZ16|4.0|In the Trouser Press record guide Ira Robbins called the Clash \\"the world's most unpredictable band,\\" and this album supports the Clash's claim to that (dubious) title. Everything is on this album - dub, folk, calypso, gospel, disco, hip-hop (the Clash beat most other rock bands to exploiting that sound), and even a couple of traditionally Clashy rockers.<br /> When I first bought this album I hated it - except for the handful of tracks that sound like \\"London Calling\\" album, but with time my ears grew less prejudiced and I began to appreciate it. There is at least one great album (maybe two) hidden in this mess. I count around 16 songs on this album that I usually don't skip over when listening to it now - scattered throughout the entire album - (but CDs make skipping tracks easy). <br />My favorites: \\"Magnificent Seven\\" (the live version on \\"From Here to Eternity\\" is better though), \\"Junco Partner\\", \\"The Leader\\", \\"Something about England\\", \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\", \\"The Crooked Beat\\", \\"One More Time\\", \\"Lightning Strikes...\\", \\"Up in Heaven...\\", \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", \\"Police on my Back\\", \\"Call up\\", \\"Washington Bullets\\", \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", \\"Kingston Advice\\", \\"The Street Parade\\"<br />If the Clash had released a single or double album instead of a triple I'd give this five stars - the good stuff is as good as anything they ever did, including the first album - but they seem to have released *everything* they did in these sessions rather than separating the wheat from the chaff. Since the Clash make the listener do the filtering on this I took off a star.

B000002UAU|5.0|I first listened to Sgt Pepper when I was about 4 or 5.  I had no idea what it was, but the gatefold cover was very fascinating to me.  It was rare to see lyrics on a the back sleeve (this was in the mid 70's - so other groups had done similar things with printing lyrics), and I found myself reading along.  From that day I was a Beatles fan for life.  The songs are a psychedelic headphone paradise!  Many songs are played on the radio, so you probably will know most of it.  It should be listened to all the way through to get a little \\"ride.\\" <BR>This album has so much hype around it, and how it is the album to end all albums.  I believed it for years until I got older and expanded my own collection.  I also read a lot about musical history.  First off, it is not the first concept album.  There were country artists doing concept albums before this.  Example: Marty Robbins - Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs from 1959 (even had a sequel!).  It DOES count.  ALL the songs on his album are tied in.  Same with, Ray Price - Nightlife.  Another country classic from 1963.  All the songs deal with people in the Nightlife.  What is the theme of Sgt. Pepper?  What does Mr. Kite have to do with Help from Friends?  Within You and Without You has a connection to Fixing A Hole?  No, it does not.  Truth is, The Beatles never had a concept album, and I don't count the fact that there is a reprise of the title song.  That DOESN'T make it a concept album!!!  Besides, this album was done to try and compete with the Beach Boys Pet Sounds album from 1966.  That was all Lennon and McCartney were listening to in 1966.  Read their quotes about it.  They were going crazy for it!  The Beatles did not invent psychedlic music.  Groups like Love, Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd (who recorded their debut album in the same studio as The Beatles), Frank Zappa and the Mothers, The Doors and many more were already there.  Even the Byrds song Eight Miles High was written and initially recorded in late 1965.  Anyway, the legend of Pepper will endure and probably will become the accepted \\"truth\\" of what it has become.  I guess it is a worthy \\"myth\\" to have.

0783240236|4.0|Hitch felt Tippi Hendren would be the \\"new\\" Grace Kelly. Well, anybody can make a mistake.<br />THE BIRDS was not exactly a mistake, but it wasn't exactly a hit either. Nonetheless, it's essential to any collector of \\"Hitchmorobilia\\". Based upon the novella by Daphne de Maurier, Hitch's movie is--well--disturbing. We see birds, hear birds singing, and usually we ignore them. Poe said, \\"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore!' \\" and Hitch reminds us in this little gem not to ignore what we don't usually notice.<br />If nothing else, Bernard Herrmann's score of mostly screeches and unearthly screams is worth the ticket price. Rod Taylor is likeable, and Ms. Hendren is lusciously unlikeable in this apocolyptic fable of nature run not only riot, but totally insane. The final scene, of that car leaving in the presence of Birds Birds Everywhere--well, my dreams were troubled \\"evermore\\" for a good long time.<br />\\"THE BIRDS\\" is not one of Hitchcock's best films. The worst HITCH ever is better than none at all! And this one is a Tandy &lt;as in Jessica Tandy, that is, as the superbly despicable Mother-almost-in-law>.<br />Buy It. Enjoy It. And wonder, as I have for over 30 years, \\"Just what DOES it all mean anyway?\\"<br />And watch out for crows.  UGH!
B000005IRG|5.0|although television has been lumped in with some of the great punk and new wave visionaries their sound was truely all their own. born from the sweaty steamy streets of new york city it developed its unique sound amidst a disco movement and dinosaur rock and posed as unwitting passengers on the punk bandwagon. strewn from the breeding ground that was called cbgb's ( blondie, talking heads and patti smith to name a few others) they garnered a healthy audience size due to their following in london, england (arent all the greats discovered there first, at least it seems.<BR>there is the background of the group headed by tom verlaine (you may recognize the name as he was the producer behind jeff buckley's posthumous album my sweetheart the drunk. <BR>like many others i have been transfixed by the music that has come out of great britain and as a means of keeping myself in the loop with new music i have also been an avid reader of great weekly rags like melody maker and nme and q magazine (as well) for a number of years. the album marquee moon was one of these albums that was always mentioned as the cornerstone of indie rock and post new wave. i can recall beeing mesmorized by its album cover. four odd looking lost souls.after many times of persuading myself from buying in favor of more mainstream releases i finally managed to alleviate the curiosity and bought the album. <BR>at first listen the music seemed kind of lifeless to me a bit like david bowie's work on low and heroes. there is a lack of warmth in the lyrics giving it a mechanical flavor and a bit disorienting at times. the music i can honestly say is where the magic lies. there was no end to the artistry instilled in the guitar solos that were produced and in many ways were akin to the dual guitar work that was found on much of the allman brothers early work. marquee moon will have you spellbound from the first note. after 5 minutes of the title song you will find yourself imagining you are in the band as wellgetting ready for your impressive air guitar solo. punk and new wave were restrictive in their ability to explore (bands like talking heads clearly changed the way this music sounded.) different sound scapes but television clearly avoided these taboos. although the life of the band was shortlived many bands owe a debt of gratitude to this band and more specifically this album. it will not disappoint if you are a fan of indie rock. <BR>it is almost impossible to imagine going to your local sam goody back in the day (say 1977) and perusing the favorite artists of the day and seeing this album along side donna summer, saturday night fever and rod stewart. this album is very much the big bang from which all new wave derived.

Even the most cursory glance at the cast will tell you that ennui will NOT ensue during this 90 some odd minutes. All right, all right, some of the love scenes seem a bit dated, but with all the vim and vigor of the rest of the movie, that's only nit-picking, and by a small soul at that.<br />Flynn surpasses his own legend in this adaptation of the Sherwood legend; Rathbone <in his pre-Sherlock Holmes villianous glory> is deliciously and terrifyingly nasty; and Claude Raines as Prince John is the embodiment of pure oily evil charm. <br />Oh, there's also Olivia de Havilland in all her costumes <in their technicolor glory!> as the vain, but true Maid Marion. <br />This is a movie you watch again, and again, and again, and each time find more and more to enjoy.

0316666343|1.0|After reading about how wonderful this book is, and seeing its fabulous placement in the bookstores, I bought a copy for both my mom and I, thinking it would be great.  After all, the premise is orginal, compelling...<br />But neither of us could finish it.  I made it to chapter 5 and my mom made it only to chapter 3.  The protagonist, Susie, goes off on so many unimportant tangents, and the narrator (Susie, again) is portrayed to be omniscient--delving into everybody's thoughts--which I found hard to believe, and a bit irritating.<br />Kudos to the book for the original storyline, but, for us, it was way too difficult to maintain interest in the storyline with all of the fluff.<br />I'm happy that Sebold has been able to enjoy tremendous success with her debut novel--the dream of every aspiring author--but I found myself extremely disappointed, and I would not recommend the book, especially in hardcover.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I watched KING KONG as a young kid in the 1950's on Million Dollar Movie. I was so cought up in it, I really thought it was a documentary. I really believed Kong had lived. I was sure the movie was a telling of real events. I wondered if there were other Kongs out there. I was filled with excitement. I was worried about it. Other Kongs might come soon I thought! Only later as I became interested in the making of KING KONG did I learn that the two producers were in  fact documentary film makers. They built their movie to resemble a real documentary because that was their style. In the seventies, Night of the living dead too was slanted toward a documentary style. Viewing becomes involvement. King Kong tugged at my shirt sleeve durring those weeks after first seeing it. The grainy and flashing animated Kong looked like the news camaras could only capture him that way. This is lost on the later versions. They may have the beast looking more like a real beast, but it's too clear.<BR>In fact it is this grainy news reel footage quality that gives the original King Kong it's effectiveness. It was as if the movie was stolen from some foreign country where this monster is on the loose and we all may be in danger! This is the reason the original KING KONG stands the test of time.

0316666343|1.0|I guiltily admit I bought this book because of pre-release hype.  Now I remember why I never read books \\"expected\\" to be earthshattering:  they never are.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" is yet another example.<br />Early on, I was intrigued by Susie's abduction and subsequent Heaven, but it wasn't long before I found myself getting annoyed.  Her Heaven wears thin quickly because it seems to lack true comfort and joy.  Perhaps it more represents Purgatory.  After all, there were so many references about moving on, away from Earth and further into Heaven.  And one seemingly minor characteristic was huge in it's implication....Susie's friend, the deceased Holly, spoke perfect English because it was her wish to have no foreign accent in Heaven.  Heaven is only American English?  Anyway, moving on....<br />Halfway through I put the book down and didn't pick it back up for a good month.  All the characters were completely empty of any emotion.  I saw absolutely no true mourning of Susie, with the exception of her father.  The mother was one of the most self-absorbed, indifferent women I've ever read in a novel (would readers be so understanding of her if it was a man behaving that way?)  Lindsey began by cutting herself off emotionally from the world but there was never any development of that tendency, or her growing out of it.  Buckley grew up to be bitter, but his character was completely dropped from the all-too-neat roundup at the end.  Ray never seemed that taken by Susie or that broken up by her death, and there was no evidence of him holding her in his heart (even after his final, contrived and blockbuster film rip-off encounter with her).  Ruth....I couldn't figure out if she was supposed to be a psychic with lesbian tendencies or just a girl touched by stories of murdered women.  The grandmother was just plain annoying.  And as for Susie, she watches all from Heaven/Purgatory but seems so emotionless; there isn't joy or pain, and it isn't long before the interesting twist of the dead observing from Heaven becomes just plain, old fashioned third-person narrative.<br />Also, Susie and Lindsey, as young girls, are written far too maturely.  Particularly Lindsey, who embarks on a sexual relationship at a frighteningly young age, yet with total womanly maturity.  It is the rare author who can successfully write children; Sebold is clearly NOT one of them.<br />So many more things were hinted at and abandoned:  Len's emotional loneliness, Harvey's childhood, Ray's mother, the investigation, I don't have time to complete the list.  I cannot recommend this book.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|This album was a major flounder. [Americana] signalled the beginning of the Offspring's major publicity drive. Their songs were now mass produced and over exposed in the media. As a result, people became sick of this album after about 2 months. When it comes to the Offspring, people always rate thier singles the best. I find that \\"spoon-fed deadheads\\" are the ones with this opinion, as they do not have the intelligence to really listen to the true message of a song. Almost all of their singles are pointless and just plain [poor]. I draw an exception to \\"gotta get away\\" and \\"Gone away\\" which were both good, but \\"all i want\\", \\"Get a job\\" and \\"pretty fly\\" are all trashy little jingles whose lyrics I wouldn't wipe my [rear] with! For a really good song, download \\"Amazed\\" which was sadly over shadowed by \\"all i want\\". I feel that the majority of morons tuned it to it, and refused to venture to the back of the CD. The Offspring is about true feelings and the realities of life, not selling cheap songs to a bunch of stupidoes who rely on the media for a cheap music fix. Those who want good music will know that Smash is probably not the great legend that it is, as the first album is totally under-estimated. Ixnay was also excellent. These 3 albums all have their strong and weak points, but I guess that Smash is the first one that sold a large amount of copies...but I like Ixnay purely because of \\"Amazed\\"
B00003CXI0|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be an overhyped little kids movie, but it really isn't.  I had refused to read the books and watch the movie until my mom became hooked on the books.  Then, I gave in...and now I'm glad I did.<br />This movie is a spectacular ride through a young wizard's (Harry) introduction to the magic that was always in his blood.  He and his friends go on an adventurous journey to stop the madman who killed Harry's parents, and show that they are all brave, true, and loyal.<br />The special effects are incredible.  Of course, sometimes, you can tell that they're using animitronics instead of the actors.  (I think that might be on purpose, though.)<br />I definitely recommend that you watch this movie...no matter how old you are because you will definitely enjoy it!

078401213X|5.0|I realyl didn't know much about &quot;Pi&quot; when I rented it.  I had heard it was really good, and I had heard it was very cleverly done.  <BR>I watched it and I was amazed.  The movie's grainy black and white, while a little annoying in the beginning ends up adding so much to the texture.  Several chase scenes near the end would have seemed boring an monotonous hadn't it been for the black and white and shaky filming.  On the commentary track for this DVD, Aronofsky reveals another thing that makes this film so cool.  What he calls &quot;hip-hop entandre's&quot; add to the paranoid feelings on Max (the protagonist played by Sean Gullette, a mathmeticion exploring wall street and the number pi).  These &quot;hip-hop entandres&quot; are combinations of fast sounds and fast camera shots.  <BR>The movie is awesome.  Aronofsky and Libatique (the director of photography) have made a film that is almost flawless.  After wathcing this movie you know that this team is going somehwere.  Aronofsky wrote and directed it, proving he is a ture talent.  A movie this good as a debut goes to show that a lot is expected of him.  <BR>He conquered &quot;Pi&quot; when he wrote and directed &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; with Hubert Selby, Jr.  &quot;Pi&quot; is an important debut from an extremely talented and important director.
0783225733|3.0|Unlike \\"The Right Stuff,\\" the brilliant film on the Mercury space program that focuses more on character profiles and symbolism than factual history, \\"Apollo 13\\" is an entertaining space film that can be used by high school and junior high history teachers. This is due to director Ron Howard and his crew's painstaking recreation of the Apollo space program -- from using a weightless environment to borrowing large chunks of mission control transcripts. The recreations are so dead-on that astronauts and mission control members report having forgotten they were on a set, or confusing the digital imitations for the real thing.<br />Where Howard's dazzling special effects and technical accuracy leave off, his cast takes over. Tom Hanks' enthusiasm for the subject matter shows as Commander Jim Lovell. He skillfully portrays both the excitement of going into space and the stoicism with which the astronauts approached their dangerous work. Bill Paxton as Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert and Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife Marilyn also shine, but it is masters of subtlety Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz and Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly who steal every scene. They are given ample opportunity to do so, thanks to the wise decision to focus as much on the heroism on the ground from geeks with pocket protectors as the heroism in space from the astronauts.<br />The only problem is the film's occasional ham-handedness, most noticably in its attempts to place the mission in a historical context. Where Hanks, Howard and producer Brian Grazer's miniseries \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" (in the segment \\"1968\\") deftly underscored the turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s, this film makes offhand references through the eldest Lovell daughter to the Hippie Movement and the Beatles breaking up, which comes off as crass and afterthought-like.<br />Still, the film is alternately suspenseful and meticulous in most of the right places, and is therefore valuable both as a movie and as a historical record.<br />The DVD was made when studios were only beginning to play with the medium, and while the \\"Apollo 13\\" DVD was an early groundbreaker, the awkwardness shows. An hour-long documentary and two commentary tracks -- one from Howard, one from the real-life Jim and Marilyn Lovell -- together provide a glimpse into both the historical facts and the filmmaking tricks (although screenwriters William Broyles, Jr. and Al Reinert are entirely ignored). But the extras mostly stop there. There is a trailer and production and cast and crew notes, and the menu is a CD for the film score soundtrack, albeit a CD which cannot be paused and in which you can skip FORWARD but not BACKWARDS. Yet the DVD is a far cry from the Special Editions of today. There are no NASA documentaries, for instance, and very little original documentary footage.<br />While it seems possible, perhaps likely, that Universal could eventually release an even more loaded DVD release, the current one is more than adequate for educational and entertainment purposes.

He also works at a Colonial Theme park set in 1734 called Colonial Dusboro where he meets his best friend, Denny.  He is however, according to Victor, a frien out of necessity.  It is also about his relationship with a docotr caring for his mother named Paige Marshall who says she can save his mother if he has sex with her.  Oh, one more thing, he pretends to choke to death on food and gets money from the people who save him.<BR>Like \\"Survivor\\" your sympathy is fully engaged from the first page.  He starts narrating the book saying \\"If you're going to read this, don't bother.\\"  He is basicaly saying his life isn't important.

It has its share of humor, most of which occur while he cruises his sexaholics meetings.  <BR>This is a very funny, very entertaining book.

B000003S0F|5.0|1971's _Islands_ is quite the subject of mixed opinions among King Crimson fans. Many probably were not ready for something on the more subdued side (at least for King Crimson.)<br /><br />'Boz', lead vocalist and bassist for this album only, admitted in an interview from a Bad Company profile (the band he would join after leaving Crimson) that he disliked the material he helped to create on this album. I couldn't disagree more. While I do enjoy this album, I must admit that I do not pull it out very often.<br /><br />The music found on Islands is not as aggressive as on albums like Red or the debut. Instead, it's more reflective, subtle, ambient, esoteric, celestial, absorbing and meditative. It starts with Formentera Lady, which reminds me of early Moody Blues. It's mostly ambient-driven featuring flute, bass, sax and assorted percussion. Sailor's Tale seems to pick up where the previous track left off (the sax hints at the latter in the last few minutes of Formentera Lady) which is a spellbindingly atmospheric and inventive jazz rock tune. The Letters spews forth dark and ambient soft guitar passages, followed by ominous and fiery jazz rock. Ladies Of The Road sounds _Beatle-esque_, especially the vocal harmonies. However, the subject matter (sexual) is more Rolling Stones (not designated). Song Of The Gulls is an instrumental bridging new age and classical forms. Very heavenly instrumental. Islands (title track) is no different. Ethereal and soothing instrumentation combined with ethereal and soothing vocals makes this a perfect track to unwind to.<br /><br />Islands is far too subtle and esoteric to be appreciated by everyone, including King Crimson fans. To take it a step further, it's not an album that will reveal it's strengths upon first listening. If subtle, atmospheric-ambient jazz, new age or classical (with rock added) is your cup of tea, this may be a wonderful pick. Give this album time and you may be rewarded with the transcendent and magical breeze of a wonderful _Island_.
B0000542D2|5.0|A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was a pivotal moment in the history of the Beatle's. Until its release, they had a massive number of detractors, who were positive that they were merely the flavor of the month, four guys who would enjoy a few months of success, and then disappear. People over thirty were having an especially difficult time taking them seriously. This film made everyone, and not just their fans, take them seriously. New York Times critic Clive Barnes wrote a reluctant yet highly praise-worthy review, explaining that while he had previously not enjoyed the Beatles, the movie was, nonetheless, irresistible.<br />By any conceivable standard, this movie is ground breaking. Visually, director Richard Lester broke new ground by employing a hand held camera for much of the film, giving the film a realistically documentary look. He was also able in this way to give the film a constant visual energy that never flags from the opening credits until the final fabulous shot of the Fab Four's helicopter freeze framed in the sky. The script contains not merely a bevy of first-rate jokes, but introduces several moments of surreality. An example of the latter is the Beatles being chased by fans through a train near the beginning of the film. They reach a baggage car with a cage in the center for valuables, into which they lock themselves. They begin playing cards while the girls all scream. They begin singing, cards in hand, \\"I Should Have Known Better.\\" Gradually, however, the cards disappear, with Ringo suddenly having drumsticks in his hands, then another a guitar, until they eventually and inexplicably have all their instruments. As the song fades out, the instruments all disappear, and the cards reappear in their hands.<br />The reason this films continues to delight and entertain is that Richard Lester wanted to make a great movie that happened to star the Beatles, that could stand on its own, and not just a film that would capitalize on their fame. As a result, the film is stuffed to the brim: with ideas, inventive camera shots, unusual and bizarre characters, and more jokes this side of AIRPLANE! There are so many jokes that many might escape the notice of the casual viewer. For instance, while the \\"manager\\" of the Beatles argues with one of the boys, Paul sits with a Pepsi bottle to his nose, apparently trying to snort the contents into his nose. Or the constant jokes revolving around Paul's grandfather being such a \\"clean old man.\\"<br />Special mention has to be made of Wilfred Brambell. He had achieved great success in one of the greatest TV shows of all time, STEPTOE AND SON, which was the series that the American TV series SANDFORD AND SON was based upon. Brambell is unforgettable playing Paul's grandfather. The boys are all so good you can't say Brambell steals scenes, but that says more about the unexpected charisma of the boys' performances than it does about Brambell, who manages to be equally as dominant in all his scenes. Astonishingly, he was only fifty-one years old at the time of filming, though he looks a great deal older than that.<br />I have been amazed in talking to friends to find out how many have not seen this film. Anyone who is a fan of the Beatles (or even if a non-fan) should see this film as quickly as possible. It not only represents the moment when the world at large was forced to take the Beatles seriously but also remains one of their greatest moments as performers.stuffed to the brim: with ideas, inventive camera shots, unusual and bizarre characters, and more jokes this side of AIRPLANE! There are so many jokes that many might escape the notice of the casual viewer. For instance, while the \\"manager\\" of the Beatles argues with one of the boys, Paul sits with a Pepsi bottle to his nose, apparently trying to snort the contents into his nose. Or the constant jokes revolving around Paul's grandfather being such a \\"clean old man.\\"<br />Special mention has to be made of Wilfred Brambell. He had achieved great success in one of the greatest TV shows of all time, STEPTOE AND SON, which was the series that the American TV series SANDFORD AND SON was based upon. Brambell is unforgettable playing Paul's grandfather. The boys are all so good you can't say Brambell steals scenes, but that says more about the unexpected charisma of the boys' performances than it does about Brambell, who manages to be equally as dominant in all his scenes. Astonishingly, he was only fifty-one years old at the time of filming, though he looks a great deal older than that. <br />I have been amazed in talking to friends to find out how many have not seen this film. Anyone who is a fan of the Beatles (or even if a non-fan) should see this film as quickly as possible. It not only represents the moment when the world at large was forced to take the Beatles seriously but also remains one of their greatest moments as performers.
B00003CXA6|5.0|A lot of folks have commented on this movie, so why should there be one more? Last night a friend and his wife joined me for dinner. Afterwards, I showed him the section where the Confederates form up for Pickett's Charge. He is a Korean War vet who wept unabashedly as the Charge went in. This is my all time favorite movie to the extent that I wore out the VHS tape with repeated viewings. It is a painstakingly yet loving and respectful rendering of the pivotal battle of the Civil War. It is well cast and well acted. Martin Sheen is not a favorite of mine, but he captures Robert E. Lee as well as anyone could. The film shows in moving detail how deeply the troops cared for Lee, as they did in reality. Tom Beringer, who is a favorite, is excellent as General Longstreet. The facial hair on most characters is obviously fake, but not to the point of being distracting. At four hours, it's a long, long film, but it simply never drags; it is in the details that the story line and the reality of the setting are maintained There are no computer enhanced graphics; the cast includes several thousand Civil War reinactors, which produces combat scenes of gut-wrenching realism. Some of them are interviewed in an \\"extra feature\\", and their reverence for the battle site is moving. \\"Gettysburg\\" permits the viewer to understand, through the onscreen exchanges between characters, what the Civil War was all about. But most of all, it demonstrates the unflagging courage which American soldiers have displayed since the birth of our Country, and it is probably that aspect of the film that I find most moving. The DVD needs a big screen to do justice to the panoramic scope of the battle scenes, but the disc is a marked improvement over the tape. If I have one reservation, it has to do with the sound. Dolby 5.0 is good, but to have the subwoofer kick in during the artillery firing sequences would have been better. If you want to find out a little bit about what this Country is all about, seethis film
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day got me into Punk Rock. Green Day made me an individual. Green Day is the very voice of the American Punk. I love their music, I love the way they dress, their voices, their hair, their album covers, I JUST LOVE THEM!!! This album is essential to my CD case, along with The Queers, Operation Ivy, The Ramones, Propagandhi, The Suicise Machines, and other great Punk cds. Catch you later, you rebel you!;)
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is the Stevie masterpiece. Innervisions is a classic, yes, and Music of My Mind is great, and Talking Book wonderful too, and even Fulfillingness has its moments, but my oh my, SITKOL is way out their in the stratosphere of musical achievements.<br />The earlier albums all had an intimate feel, because Stevie pretty much played every instrument himself. Here he blows the budget big time by getting all sorts of extra musicians in, and we have the full panoply of studio additions - guitars, bass, keyboards, and drums, which for a change are sometimes played by musicians who aren't Stevie Wonder; plus plentiful backing singers, and multi-layered sound effects. The result is an album that is almost too much to listen to in one sitting (it's probably far too long anyway, and might give you Deep Vein Thrombosis). It will give you a headache as it throws the kitchen sink at you, and by the time you make it onto the second side, you're already flagging. Then comes eight minutes of Black Man.<br />The beauty of this album is basically that it is a collection of so many great songs, but it is advisable maybe just to listen to a handful here and there at one go. Otherwise it's funk overload.<br />You can't complain at the quality of the songs. The first side is simply one masterpiece after another. The second side is weaker, though Isn't She Lovely is great, Black Man is funky before it wanders off into Orwellian brainwashing, As is a knockout classic, Another Star is great though with overmany la-la-las. Then the 'something extra', of which the highlight is Ebony Eyes.<br />The themes of the songs are the usual Stevie fare - love in all its forms (did this man fall in love a lot or what?), religion (Have a Talk With God is brilliant), the sufferings of black people. I have to take issue with Black Man, though, which I feel is a hilariously misguided and crassly handled attempt at spreading racial harmony on America's bicentennial, which the song does by boasting of the achievements of black, brown, white, red and yellow men . . . Hmmm. It doesn't help that at times Stevie seems to be scraping the barrel with some of his non-white heroes - president of the international blood bank, anyone?<br />But what I feel embarrassed about on Black Man is what I usually so love - Stevie's idiosyncracy, his bravery in trying to tackle subjects in songs no one else ever does, and when I first read the lyrics to Black Man I had no idea how he could turn it into a workable piece. Yet he does. Reading the lyrics shows you that he is essentially a great avant garde poet, in which As is surely his greatest achievement, because the lyrics are quitely frankly bonkers. But so too is Summer Soft (which is about spring and winter, would you believe), or Saturn. That is the genius of the man.<br />Of course the magnificent outros, of which Stevie is the world champion, are here in force, perhaps even more than any other album. Isn't She Lovely goes on for ages, as does As and, even more, Another Star (three and a half mins of song, four and a half of outro!), or Summer Soft. There are some superb, more ordinary songs: Contusion is a brilliant and funky instrumental, which reminds me a little of Daftpunk; and Sir Duke is just the most get-up-and-dance-able song ever made.<br />This is a fantastic album, but it's probably better to have tried your toe in the waters of the Wonder ocean with something like Innervisions first. If you like that, graduate onto this. The Daddy of Stevie albums, his finest work before he went mad and wrote Happy Birthday and starting getting involved in dangerous collaborations with Paul McCartney. A pure masterpiece of groovy, funky, soulful, RnB, pop genius, with a voice that can perform miracles (and an accordian that could teach Bob Dylan a trick or two, like how to play the right note).
B000007S5B|5.0|The real explanation for this album is that the Doors had every<BR>intention of releasing it as \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" and<BR>it was going to be a concept album. The Lizard was to take up the<BR>entire disc but Elektra freaked when the Doors approached them<BR>with that idea (how many times have the suits and ties shot down<BR>a great idea). So they had to reach back into Jim's grab bag of<BR>old song ideas that he wrote when he was sleeping on Venice Beach. This is why the album sounds so fragmented. Even with that, it is still a classic, after all, we are talking The Doors. I highly recommend reading \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\"<BR>excellent book and perfect reference guide for anything Doors.<BR>It is truly sad that the greatest and most enduring music of the<BR>late 60's/early 70's came out of Los Angeles and no one even bothered to listen to it. Your CD collection will be upgraded 100% if you purchase any or all of these incredible discs -<BR> - Love - 1st album by Arthur Lee and Love<BR> - Love - Forever Changes<BR> - Doors - 1st album, Strange Days, Morrison Hotel<BR> - Spirit - 1st album, 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus<BR> - Canned Heat - Best of<BR> - Joni Mitchell - Ladies of the Canyon and Blue<BR> - Buffalo Springfield - Again<BR> - Neil Young - Everybody know this is nowhere<BR>_- Frank Zappa - We're only in it for the money<BR> - Capt. Beefheart - Trout Mask replica<br /> What other region in the world can come up with the variety<BR> and professionalism of that list? All at the same time??!!<BR> Woefully underappreciated.........
B000002L99|4.0|I think Sammy Hagar is great. He was good in Montrose and he was good in his solo albums. He dosen't fit in Van Halen. This album is the last good Halen disc, but it's not a classic. Diamond Dave was the real frontman for Van Halen. This record is decent, but it sounds more like Europe then Van Halen. If you are looking for classic Van Halen, get the first four albums. &quot;Diver Down&quot; was just a lazy joke album. Van Halen is great, but not without David Lee Roth.
B000002I2M|5.0|With the first album, you had a out-of-left-field record that<BR>still is influential to this day. The more expansive and surreal<BR>2nd album makes it a must-have for Doors fans. The incomplete<BR>\\"Lizard King\\" project turned into the 3rd album, which includes<BR>the unforgettable \\"Spanish Caravan\\". Mandatory if only for that<BR>one song. Then the often-abused \\"Soft Parade\\" came out and showed that the group could branch out and try new avenues. The<BR>awesome and scary \\"Morrison Hotel\\" followed and cemented their<BR>place in rock history. Absolutely Live was the first double disc<BR>and showcased some drunken moments and some brilliant moments (the scream at the beginning of \\"Back Door Man\\" comes from another world). Now we come to their finale - \\"L.A. Woman\\". This<BR>album is notable due to the bluesy feel of most cuts. But there<BR>are moments on this one that take you back to the Sunset Strip in 1967 when they played at the Whiskey. I really enjoy listening to \\"Cars Hiss by my Window\\" and the intro space part of \\"L'America\\". The latter is the most underrated song the Doors ever recorded. In the days of the vinyl LP it was very important for most groups to have a strong statement to open up side 2, especially if side 1 had a bunch of great tunes. The Doors knew this better than any other band. Think about some of their side 2 openers - Back Door Man, People are Strange, Spanish Caravan and of course L'America. \\"L.A. Woman\\" is such a great CD that it is essential to any rock collection. 1971 had some all-time rock recordings and \\"L.A. Woman\\" was one of them. Buy it and wear it out..........
B0000508U6|4.0|I would compare Coldplay to a tamer Radiohead. I liked this album a lot, but it got old pretty fast. After listening to the whole thing, the songs started to sound the same. Nevertheless, I wouldn't underestimate the talent of this band.
052594527X|2.0|This book was okay... Very well written, nice descriptions, well developed charecters, belivible events ect... <BR>But the book has little plot, no real story line and untimitly goes nowhere. Rather like everyday life. If you want to hear about everyday life (as I know some do) then you will love this book. <BR>But if you'd enjoy some plot, a bit of story  and something more then day to day stuff, then this book is not for you. It is also reletivly slow to develope into even appriciatable work. <br />Something for anyone who reads this to know, this book is highly over rated and if you read with those expectations you will be dissapointed.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt has been around for more than 10 years! They are still great. Their style has changed a little more over the years, but I'm still impressed with each new album they make. RockSteady was a lot different than I had expected. It's more rock. Their single &quot;Hella Good&quot; gave me an impression of a heavy techno beat, and I LOVE IT. If you like ska or even poprock, you will enjoy No Doubt!
B000065V1V|5.0|This is easily Bowie's best album in decades.  I disagree with those who say this is just for Bowie fans; it's an excellent pop/rock album for anybody who likes contemporary music.  All the songs are good, and the best thing about the album is the song-writing.  The songs are original, inventive, mature, and catchy, and there's not a bad one in the bunch.  People who don't think of themselves as Bowie fans, or who don't even normally like Bowie, should give this one a try; it's just a good album, pure and simple.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I LOVED this movie, and I LOVE the music with it. I'm not a big fan or bluegrass or older country music, but this soundtrack kicks my own butt. I liked each song differently. If you loved the movie, you will probably like the soundtrack too. If you're into bluegrass or folk music, you might like it, too. If you're not into it, you still might like it!
B00005OM5L|5.0|This is one of Claptons bettter shows I have seen, Hes really in top form. Everything is spot on from his singing to his  sweet blues twang playing. It really captures the feeling of a live Clapton show, I have seen him Three times in my life over 2 decades and I can say with some authority this is the show to have on DVD. If you ever wanted to hear the blues with rock soul played by one of the masters, then you must get this DVD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The talent John Mayer has, is unbelievable! He is such a great singer and writer. I bought his album only after hearing two songs, and I was NOT disappointed with the rest of it, at all! He has a such a wonderful peaceful smooth voice. I would compare him to either Jeff Buckley (a god in my book), and Dave Mathews from Dave Mathews Band. He sounds more similar to Dave Mathews. This was such a great album, that I'm sure if you are into modern rock like DMB, Jeff Buckley, or Coldplay - you would definitely like John Mayer!
B0000636UN|5.0|I love the song SOAK UP THE SUN,so i bought this cd,what a GREAT cd!I think it is the best one I've bought this year.It is better than Eminem,better than Alanis Morissette...It rocks,it belongs to SUMMER!The best song I think is IT'S ONLY LOVE.
B00004UEDR|4.0|At first, I didn't want to see this video, but I watched it with a friend. Sandra Bullock portrays an alcoholic unwilling to quit her erratic behavior. She learns who she hurts, and how, and ends up learning how to help herself with her addiction. I thought this movie showed a lot of the real life aspects of being an addict of alcohol. It's not exactly a family movie, but if you're into movies that make you think a little, you might enjoy this one.
0380789035|5.0|American Gods deserves, for the most part, the Bram Stoker Award for best novel it won earlier this year from the Horror Writers Association. Neil Gaiman's twilight-of-the-gods epic/Great American Novel is a long, rollicking romp that reads like part Dickensian potboiler, part picaresque road novel, and part modern-day apocalyptic fable.  Commendably, it somehow manages to be both fun and ponderous.<br />Gaiman, creator of the Sandman comic series and author of the previous novel Neverwhere, has succeeded where not many dare to venture. Reminiscent of Stephen King's classic good-vs.-evil epic The Stand, American Gods asks what might happen if all of the dead and dying gods from the word's oldest religions were to take one final bloody stand against the modern gods of the Internet, technology and international commerce. The spoils of the war? Our belief, of course. Our hearts and minds.<br />The novel's protagonist is a large, deceptively oafish man named Shadow who has recently been released from prison. No sooner does he gain his freedom than he discovers that both his wife and best friend have just been killed in a gruesome automobile accident. On his plane ride home to attend the funerals, Shadow meets a mysterious older gentleman named Wednesday. The stranger, who might very well be a modern incarnation of an Old Norse God, makes a proposition to Shadow. It's an offer that, despite its dire consequences, Shadow can't refuse.<br />Shadow is a simple man whose unending passion for his dead wife and fascination for card tricks and sleight-of-hand make him a pitiable, almost childlike character. So why, if he has all the appearance of a pawn, is he being treated like a king? For reasons unknown to himself, it soon becomes clear that Shadow will play a major role in this upcoming war of the gods. As the storm of the millennium quickly approaches, he must search inside himself for the fortitude needed to play ball with the big boys.<br />American Gods is really two or three smaller novels sewn together with the sturdy thread of an ambitious premise and some weighty themes that touch on the roots of faith, myth, and the human identity. Some of the pieces prove more successful than others. I enjoyed the small-town horror novel stuck in the middle of this large dark fantasy epic, but felt it threw a snag in the pacing. And yet even the weaker aspects of this large novel can't detract much its overall force.<br />Writing a book like American Gods is like pointing out to the bleachers when you step up to the plate. The pressure's on to deliver the goods. So, did Neil Gaiman hit a homer? Did this Brit manage to write the Great American Novel? Let's say the ball hit the top of the fence and bounced over.<br />(I should mention, as an aside, that my paperback copy started falling apart on me when I was about 150 pages in; I tend to be very easy on books, so I wonder if this was a general manufacturing problem, and if other people experienced this as well.)three smaller novels sewn together with the sturdy thread of an ambitious premise and some weighty themes that touch on the roots of faith, myth, and the human identity.

B00004Z459|5.0|I love this Linkin Park (formally known as Hybrid Theory) album. I could play every song over and over and still feel the same. Each song has some personal experience related to it, and that's what I love about it. I can relate to it. Supposedly, Linkin Park has just released Reanimation, now I have a problem with a band just redoing their last album in two or three years, and re-releasing it. Come up with something new, please! But otherwise, this band kicks, and I love their music!
B00000DHRX|5.0|This album is in fact the best of George Michael. With all chart topping single intact on this album, George mixes it up with new tracks on this album. The songs being Desafinado, I Can't Make You Love Me and the much talked about Outside. I recommend this and the DVD as well. This only chronicles the best of George Michael for now.
B000068TPN|1.0|THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD MOVIE BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS NOT. THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT THE SAME QUALITY AS THE \\"TOUR OF DUTY\\" TV SERIES (FILMED IN HAWII WHICH ATLEAST LOOKS SIMILAR TO VIETNAM). I READ THE BOOK AND HAVE SOME MILITARY BACKGROUND (INFANTRY PARATROOPER 1987-94)AND IT STRUCK ME AS MOSTLY CORNEY DRAMA.<br />THE ACTING IS NOT GREAT. THE MOVIE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FILMED IN THE HILLS OF CALIFORNIA IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE TERRAIN OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF VIETNAM, THAT IN IT SELF IS DISTRACTING. IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAR WAS FOUGHT AT FT HUNTER LIGGETT CALIFORNIA. THE NVA SOLDIERS ARE ALL DRESSED IN KHAKI UNIFORMS (DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ACCURATE OR NOT MIGHT BE) WHICH LOOK AS IF THEY JUST CAME FROM THE DRY CLEANERS NOT THROUGH THE TUNNEL COMPLEX WHERE THE SOLDIERS WERE LIVING. THE SCRIPT IS VERY UNORIGIONAL, PERDICTABLE AND CORNEY.<br />THERE ARE SEVERAL SCENES WHERE AIRCRAFT (F-100 SUPER SABRES AND HUEY HELICOPTERS) ARE COMPUTER ANIMATED, UGH TERRIBLE!! M-16 MUZZLES TO THE FLOOR OF THE AIRCRAFT DURING AN AIRMOBILE OPERATION IS A NEW IDEA THE MODERN ARMY USES DURING PEACE TIME. WATCH ANY VIETNAM DOCUMENTARY OR NEWS REEL FOOTAGE AND SEE IF ANY HAVE THEIR MUZZLE POINTING AT THE FLOOR BOARD, THEY DON'T. <br />NAPALM EXPLOSIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIREY, RPG AND GRENADE EXPLOSIONS ARE NOT. I HATE TO SEE A VEHICLE GET HIT WITH AN RPG AND GO UP LIKE A GAS STATION. PEOPLE SHOT IN THE TORSO WITH RIFLE BULLETS DO NOT SPRAY BLOOD THROUGH THEIR CLOTHING THREE FEET AWAY.<br />THE AVERAGE CIVILIAN WHO HAS NEVER SEEN LIVE ORDINANCE DETONATE AND KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT INFANTRY TACTICS, WILL PROBABLY THINK THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE. IF YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED. THIS IS NO SAVING PVT RYAN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, OR PLATOON. WHAT THIS MOVIE REALLY NEEDED WAS A GOOD VIETNAM COMBAT VETERAN AS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR (GOD KNOW THERE ARE ENOUGH AROUND). THIS MOVIE IS BETTER RENTED THAN PURCHASED, IN MY OPINION.
B000002LIX|5.0|When a band follow the release of 'Nothings Shocking' with this album, gifting the world with a pair of undisputed classics, it is clear that band is something very special indeed. 'Ritual de lo Habitual' is the sound of a band at the peak of their career, a truly wonderful record, sadly their last, an album that fully deserves its reputation as a massively influential recording for alternative rock, an album that takes the breath away.<br />Jane's Addiction did more for the contemporary music scene than most realise, careering out of LA clubs with their genuinely original fusion of rock, punk and folk, not to mention the overt flamboyance of frontman Perry Farrel, showmanship and stylish mystique of guitarist Dave Navarro, incredible rhythms delivered by Stephen Perkins, and inspired basslines of Eric A.<br />This album presents a massively eclectic mix. Perry Farrel's notorious cover artwork suceeded in getting the album sleeve changed as it was deemed offensive (one would think hed have learned his lesson after the furore surrounding the 'Nothings Shocking' artwork, check it out for yourself for an instant explanation), and this is the first thing one notices upon picking up the album for the first time: the album actually makes an impression before even arriving in the cd player. When it does, a womans voice testifying in Italian that Jane's have 'More control over your children than you do' presents a puzzling introduction, but little time for contemplation is allowed as the first few bars of 'Stop' roll over us like a steam train. This first song introduces Jane's funky, punk influenced sound rapidly, instantly notching up a classic track and live favourite, resplendent with catchy chorus and histrionic guitar solo. Following this in quick succesion is 'No ones leaving', a similar sounding tale of race which sees Perry muse that he has seen 'Colour changed by a kiss: just ask my brother and my sister', providing us with food for thought. 'Aint no right', last in this trio of storming openers has us think about social conditions. 'Obvious' takes a more mellow approach and is perhaps not as memorable as the preceeding three tracks yet still a quality song. The catchy single 'Been caught stealing' follows, a song granted fame by its video, it is funky to a fault, seems reminiscent of ska in some sections and features incredible bass playing, as well as witty lyrics. The back to back epics 'Three days' and 'Then she did' comprise the mid section of the album, as well as pushing up its running time, and reminding us just how talented the band members are. 'Three days' is almost a rock anthem, despite its lengthy instrumental section. 'Then she did' is more reflective and emotive with Perry penning some extremely moving lyrics, coupled with the use of softer instrumentation. 'Of course' features some fiddle work, making this track seem more progressive and bizzare, especially when one hears its 'Slapping yourself in the face' refrain. The rippling 'Classic girl' closes the record very strongly, being as it is a pleasing guitar based melody.<br />In conclusion: an extremely strong, influential and well written record, an album that really does have something for everyone woven into its fabric. Students of contemporary, or indeed any music should certainly pick it up and discover the legacy of one of the truly artistic, charismatic and talented bands of the last two decades.his trio of storming openers has us think about social conditions.

B00000DFSK|5.0|I really wasn't the biggest U2 fan before they released this but they really just seemed to blow me away. There isn't 1 song on this entire cd that isn't worth listening to. U2 has really become the greatest band of all time.
B000065VB9|5.0|This production (for the third time in a row, with a cover cleverly put together by Storm Thorgerson's Hipgnosis) is simply packed with brilliant songs. From the opening track, &quot;Intruder,&quot; you know you are up for something big: the very first sound (a scratching sample, one of many samples that PG employed throughout this album) along with very rythmic, almost hypnotizing drums, serves as an incredible opening for an album that is somehow obscure in nature, an album where Peter explores the depths of the human mind. Very good examples of this are &quot;No self control&quot; (the maniac out of his mind), &quot;I don't remember&quot; (the amnesiac), &quot;Family snapshot&quot; (an ingenious peek into the mind of a magnicide -think Lee Harvey Oswald-, my personal favorite from this album and one of Peter's all-time best songs), &quot;Lead a Normal Life&quot; (almost a prayer from a person who wants to fit in) and &quot;Not One of Us&quot; (a rejection -you don't belong here!)<br />A flip side to the introspective tracks just mentioned is made up by &quot;Biko&quot; and &quot;Games Without Frontiers,&quot; two songs that have a touch clearly in line with Peter's struggle for world peace, an end to apartheid and an end to war. Overall, this is clearly a musical and lyrical jewel, an album (now remastered, therefore resurrected into a better sounding form) that has to be part of your collection. Now, if you are getting started with Peter, I'd recommend that you also get a copy of &quot;Security&quot; (his work following this one), which acts as sort of bridge between his early eighties work and what he would evolve into with time.
0800196767|5.0|Mara Wilson is by far most the greatest actress in the world. She's only 15, and she's rocking! I've seen Mara in other movies such as `A Simple Wish'. I've also seen a bit of her acting in `Balloon Farm'. Oh yes, let's not forget the popular `Mrs. Doubtfire', where she was first seen. In `Matilda', Mara plays an extra-smart little girl, who discovers that she has magical powers later on in life. The parents don't take care of her, often refers to Matilda as a `mistake'. Her father (Danny DeVito) sells used cars for unfair prices, and her mother (Rhea Perlman) goes to play bingo everyday.<BR> <BR>It was not until one specific day that Matilda realized she was super-smart. Harry (dad) came home all excited because he sold cars for a good `deal'. He asks Mikey (brother) to write down numeral digits on a piece of paper and expected him to solve it [without a calculator, nothing.. poor kid!]. He couldn't do it, but Matilda could! She instantly said the answer aloud...THAT'S INCREDIBLE!!!<br />Now it's time for Matilda to go to school. Time for her to get smart [like she's not a genius already, hehe]. Okay, lemme summarize the ppl in her school: Miss Honey is Matilda's teacher, who is truly wonderful [I wish all teachers were like that], Miss Trunchbull is a real [bull], and I think she got what she deserved at the end.<br />Overall, this is a great movie for both adults and kids to watch! I wish there was a Matilda part 2, so we can see what happens where they left off.

B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotels album In An Aeroplane Over the Sea is the most amazing album i have ever heard.  This album truley goes beyond music and enters the realms of a religious experiance.  The album is a euphoric mix of folk guitar, something that sounds oddly like a high school band and some strange and wonderful lyrics that seem to have extremely deep meaning that in most cases none but Jeff Mangum himself could possibley understand.<BR>  The album begins with the gorgeuos and rather twisted King of Carrot Flowers Pt.1 an intimetly simple, as is a common theme on the album, track that moves on seamlessly into The King of Carrot Flowers Pts. two and three in which Pt. one evolves into an almost fast paced rock song with wonderfully loud and simple drumming.  <BR>  The title track is also a high point of the album.  It is one of the few songs when there is no doubt what Jeff Mangum is talking about even though he approaches it in his signature strange way.  <BR>Communist Daughter and Oh Comely are two of the more amazing tracks on the cd.  Communist Daughters only flaw is that perhaps there is not enough of it.  It also displays Mangums amazing voice for he manages to make even lyrics like \\"semen stains the mountain tops\\" sound beutiful.  However what communist daughter lacks in length is made up for entirely by the four chord magic of Oh Comely.  <BR>  Amidst all these amazing songs the greatest of them all would have to be Two-Headed boy Pt. 2.  Musicly and especially lyrically this song is the peak of the album.  The emotion in the song is liable to leave you flat on your back and the fact that in the dying seconds of the album you can hear mangum put down his guitar and leave seems to put the perfect stopper in this small bottle of perfection in todays music world.<BR>  This album is a must for anyone and everyone.  I feel truely sorry for anyone who hasn't been touched by its magic and if you can't appriciate this album then there may be no hope left for you.
B00005JLDW|1.0|Probably the main reason why this ... blockbuster failed to recoup its costs at the box office is that it was poorly promoted as a big effects-driven summer blockbuster that was worthy of being up there with 'Jurassic Park' and the like.  Unfortunately this is far from the truth.  The story has a pocket of human survivors fighting against the dragons that have overrun England.  These include Christian Bale, who was so impressive in 'American Psycho', pulling off a terrible Cockney accent that is fooling no-one and the consistently topless Matthew McConaughey as the American that rallies everyone up.  If they can kill the male dragon that's fertilising all the females' eggs, can they wipe out the race of dragons once and for all?  You betcha!<br />You'd have thought that this would have been a cue for lots of dragon action, with fire and brimstone battling it out over the London skyline with helicoptors and army tanks.  Whilst there are action sequences intermittently and the special effects did an excellent job creating realistic monsters there simply isn't enough to keep the audience on the edge of their seat, something that is expected of summer box office extravanganzas.  The lack of action is especially frustrating given that the bits in between - the predictible sparring between the male leads and a blandly attractive love interest for Bale - are so dull and uninspired.  The dialogue is clichéd and doesn't serve the perfectly serviceable actors well at all, despite the wise decision to play it straight.<br />At the end of the day this is a movie that has the worst possible flaw - dullness - and whilst it's all very good promising its audience fire-breathing dragons by the score to get them into the cinema, it's another thing when you're actually watching the truth, a badly-mounted effort to steal the crown of this summer's blockbuster.  It fails.
0767800958|5.0|It is fair -- although I don't agree -- to criticize Sally Potter for directing, acting, producing, dancing.  If you want a film about dance with only professional dancing, then the criticism is valid.  But this isn't a dance movie.  Sally Potter plays herself (or is it herself?) who is working on a film (or is she?) and who takes a tango lesson (or is that a dream?) and whose life (or dream?  or film?) alters in mysterious and beautiful ways as the tango / film / dream develops.  This is an absolutely splendid &gt;&gt;personal&lt;&lt; film.  The tango is a wonderful metaphor -- back and forth, simple and complex, loving and dangerous . . . black and white.  If you like film, then this is as good a recent example as you will find of really good filmmaking.  (I bought in VHS, but would prefer DVD.)
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the best DVD's I've gotten to date. The movie itself is wonderful and includes the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn. As you probably already know the storyline, I'll just talk about DVD.<br />You get 2 discs- one contains the movie itself (with the \\"full screen\\" or \\"widescreen\\" versions, as well as a director's commentary option)and the second disc is chock full of goodies! You get \\"For the Birds\\" the 2001 Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film (shown in theaters before the movie), and \\"Mike's New Car\\" (exclusively created for the video and DVD release, as well as an exclusive sneak peek of \\"Finding Nemo\\", the newest upcoming release from Disney starring Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Willem Dafoe. Plus, if you choose the \\"Human Door\\" option, you get a tour of the Pixar animation studios by the makers of the film. They'll show you deleted scenes, 3-D location flyarounds, and animation gags and \\"inside\\" jokes. The \\"Monster World\\" door is where the real fun starts- train for your first day at Monster's Inc.; see the employee handbook, and play the \\"Boo's Door Game\\", which works like a CD rom-type game. Use your remote control to go through doors and find pieces of Boo's door that come together like a puzzle. The kids and I had tons of fun playing this together. Even our 4-month old son laughed heartily while rocking in his swing. Definitely a DVD for familes to own- worth every penny for the amount of material you get. Buy it, buy it, buy it now!
B00005QW4K|4.0|This is the final installment of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. I'll be the first to admit that Evil Dead 1 and 2 are much better, but this movie has a certain charm to it. You have to keep in mind that Raimi and Campbell wanted a throwback to the older adventure movies (like Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans), and that they played up the comedy much more in this movie. Bruce Campbell's performance, is as always, excellent. And while this movie cost more than the other two, it still has that small, cheap look to it. You have to watch it several times to appreciate. The first time just to see it. Then a second to laugh at it and the incredulisness of it (and the continuity problems). And a third time to truly appreciate it. And it is great fun to watch Ash bumble through it all. And since they introduced a level of comedy in Evil Dead II, this movie caps off the trilogy quite well.<br />It's tough to decide which edtion to get, since there are several editions of the dve. I picked up the 'Official Bootleg Edition' which has the more fitting original ending. The alternate ending (ie, the theatrical ending) isn't included on the dvd under a different heading, which I think is a mistake. Yes, play the movie with the original ending, but under the special features they should have the alternate ending that everyone has seen. There are deleted scenes, with or without commentary, and you can see what has been removed. Most was a good idea to take out, but I really wish that they had kept the windmil/tiny Ash scene to the original length. The commentary by Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi (and later in the commentary co-writer Ivan Raimi shows up) is great. It's informative and you can hear the friendship between these men. Any fan of the Evil Dead movies should have this one, and definitely get an edition with the original ending.
6300213714|4.0|Yeh this movie was always a personal favourite of mine being it delivers a fast paced non stop story. A coney island gang are wrongly accused of a murder when there out of town and to get back they have to run the gauntnet of police and all the gangs who are out there after them. The main fella \\"Swan\\" (Michael Beck) was a cool charracter. I'd have to say the violence is very tame compared to alot of movies now days.....basically its hand to hand punchups and as well as that the swearing which wouldnt be reccomended for kids. But this movie had me gripped i even started feeling like i was one of the warriors (lol) but to sum it up ...if you like fast paced adventure/action movies then this one is for you.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks made a big splash when it first came out. And I can see why. Kevin Smith made a good movie on a tiny budget. It's an entertaining movie about nothing. <br />It has its faults. You can tell an inexperienced filmmaker made the film. The camera work and editing isn't up to the standards of a 'Hollywood' film, but it does have its charm. What really carries it is the snappy dialogue. Smith has written an excellent script, and his writing is what really carries the movie (that and a great performance by Jeff Anderson). And of course Jay and Silent Bob. <br />Smith also makes a great dvd. There is a commentary by Kevin Smith and members of the cast and crew. The commentary isn't as good as I've heard on other dvds. They talk about making the movie, but it's more like they just got together. Yeah, you get the feel of their comraderie, but not enough time on the movie (and Jason Mewes should have just not been allowed to be on the commentary track--I love his character, but he just laid around drunk on the commentary track, and when he spoke, it was disruptive). There are delted scenes and an alternate ending introduced by Kevin Smith. And the Soul Asylum music video that Smith directed. <br />It's a solid movie and a solid dvd. And an important film. Any film student or filmmaker should have it. And even if you aren't a film student, it is still a great movie.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I heard this album at a friends house and from then on I was hooked. I bought Mutter first and listened to the whole thing, then again and again one more time. The album starts off very quiet then explodes into hard guitars and awesome vocals. Till has the deepest, darkest voice. It sounds like no other. The album is strong from begining to end, with no weak points along the way. Rammstein's earlier releases are excellent as well, but don't compare to &quot;Mutter&quot;. It's sad to think that great artists like this aren't being played where they belong, mainstream radio. Then people could hear them. Buy this album, go wherever it takes to find it, but buy it. You wont be dissapointed.
B00005R2IS|5.0|It actually isn't Gibson's first movie, he had a small role in one before Mad Max, but this is his first starring role, and the one that began his ascent into fame. Mad Max is set in Australia, in the near future. It hasn't gotten as post-apocalyptic as Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, but you get a definite feel of bleakness and of the apocalypse. What Mad Max is, is basically a car movie. But what a car movie. The cinematography is great (and at times dangerous for the camera operator). <br />As a dvd, the Special Edition is great (the reason I haven't bought Road Warrior is that I'm hoping they'll be releasing a special edition with the extras like contained on Mad Max). The commentary track doesn't have the director or Gibson, but it does have the DOP, Art Director, a film historian, and so on. They give a lot of great insight into the making of this film. There is also a 'trivia track' which flashes up trivia during the film. It also will point out every continuity error in the film. One of the great highlights of the dvd is that it is the original Australian recording (though you can access the American dubbing, but I think that is more for showing what dubbing does rather than to watch). There are a couple of featurettes and trailers. It's really a good dvd. And a great movie.

6305736650|5.0|Casablanca currently ranks 3 or 4 on my list of best films ever made. The performances are flawless. Curtiz's direction is flawless. The story is great. Max Steiner's score is great. There is almost nothing bad that can be said about this film. And most of the world will agree that this movie belongs in the top five films ever made. <br />That being said, why isn't there a special edition dvd? This contains a documentary 'You Must Remember This' hosted by Lauren Bacall. But why isn't there a dvd like Citizen Kane's Special editions, with all kinds of documentaries, featurettes, essays, and commentary by film historians? A definite hindsite by Warne Brothers. One I hope they rectify.
B00005K9LM|5.0|What ticks us all off is the fact that we keep getting these \\"remastered\\" albums with new tracks.  You know, I spent my hard earned cash on the original CD release.  I tell you honestly, despite a lot of criticism, that DOTF is a fantastic metal album.  But I'm not spending my worked-too-hard-for money to buy a \\"new\\" album with one extra song.  You know what this stuff is?  ...  Don't fall for it.<br />DOTF is no \\"Screaming for Vengeance,\\" which is without a doubt the best album ever recorded, metal or otherwise.  But DOTF has its own dark character that grows on you.  The album was panned (yeah, they're all panned, aren't they?) by the critics.  And a lot of metal fans say that it's a bad album and that it doesn't stand up to \\"Screaming\\" or \\"British Steel.\\"  That, sadly, is the truth.  But, this one has some real dark gems on it - such as the title track.  Sadly, this album was recorded AFTER the band reached, and left, its creative prime.  Don't believe me?  Go listen to some of the complete schlock on \\"Turbo.\\"  This album is the beginning of the end, and \\"Turbo\\" was the sellout...
B000002U94|3.0|Bob Seger's first live album, &quot;Live Bullet,&quot; (1976) is generally acknowledged to be one of the best live rock albums ever recorded.  It featured a long-struggling artist making one last pitch for the big time, which he succeeded in doing in part due to the electrifying performances on the record.  Five years later, after three multi-platinum albums and a fistful of big time radio hits had made him a household name, Seger released &quot;Nine Tonight,&quot; in a format very similar to &quot;Live Bullet.&quot;  Along the way, he lost the desperation that fired the first live album.  &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; shows Seger and the Silver Bullet Band at their crowd pleasing best, but they are no longer hungry underdogs with something to prove.<br />The playlist this time out includes 13 songs (out of 16 total) released since the first live record.  Turns out, that is part of the problem.  &quot;Live Bullet&quot; resurrected Seger's woefully underappreciated back catalog of songs, while &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; for the most part simply rehashes his star period hits without adding much to the original versions.  In addition, the song &quot;Let it Rock&quot; is unaccountably repeated from the first live album, though it is edited on CD so that the double album could be reduced to one disc.<br />Overall, a competently performed live album that nonetheless feels unnecessary and redundant.
0784011680|5.0|Charlie Chaplin.  Robert Downey, Jr.  Two of the greatest actors of the cinema in one film.  The result?  Magic!  Downey is excellent as the Little Tramp; capturing his walk, the twirling of his cane, and the wearing of his moustache.  The film has an all-star cast including Moira Kelly, David Duchovny, Marisa Tomei, and Dan Akroyd; just to name a few.  But the star of the show is Downey, in his Oscar-nominated role.  But I'm biased--I am a HUGE Downey fan and I love all of his work.  I'm also a HUGE Chaplin fan, and for me, this film is the ultimate honor for the first true star of the silver screen--the legendary Charlie Chaplin.
B00004U2HK|5.0|I had a music professor who said he hated this musical because it was too syruoy. It is but, as Clint Eastwood would say \\"I like syrupy, you got a problem with that PUNK! Musicals are suppose to be uplifting and fluffy. Most musicals from the 1940s through the early sixties were syrupy. Every song is a gem.<BR> The story centers around Maria a novice nun who is given the assignment of being the governess to the children of the widowed Baron Von Trapp. The musical opens with a beautiful panoramic view of the gorgeous Austrian country side. The camera then focuces on Maria where she sings the tile song. From that very moment your spirit is uplifted. Maria eventually goes to the Von Tapp home and wins over the children. One of the best scenes is when she teaches the children to sing by singing \\"Do Re Mi\\" While seeing this song the children are traveling through the beautiful city of Saltzberg. THe Baron Von Trapp was portrayed as a very stern and strick man. The real Von Trapp children protested the way their father was portrayed in this musical. IN one scene he fires Maria. After firing her he hears his children singing (the title song) in perfect harony and I MEAN PERFECT HARMONY. I get goosebumps every time I hear tis song. The Baron then melts when he hears his children singing he then asks Maria to stay. He eventually starts falling love with her. Maria become uncinfortable and returns to the convent. When the Mother superior confronts her she tells her that the walls of the convent are not a santuary from the real world. Then she sings \\"Climb every mountain\\" , which is my favorite broadway tune in any musical. Maria returns to the Baron and his children and marries him. While on their honeymoon the Nazis have taken over Austria. THe baron is then forced to serve in the Navy of the Third Reich. He tries to flee with his family. He is stopped. He tells them he is going to the musical festival. They take his family to the festival. In one marvelous scene he sings Eidelweiss. He was basically telling the Nazis what they can do with their Third Riech. And by the looks of their faces in the audience, they knew he was telling them what they can do with Third Reich. They then escape into switzerland.<BR> I realize the musical is contrived. The real Von Trapp family left for America by ship before the occupation of the Nazis. The musical is an american musical treasure and stands as one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest along with Oklahoma! and The King and I.
0399134204|5.0|Amy Tan has wriiten a truly touching story here.  Between four mothers and their daughters there is a lot to tell.  The mothers all came from China for on reason or another.  Then all had lives which were different and for some reason they all went to the US of A.  A big part of the story is the enlightenment that june goes through with the help of her mothers three close friends and her experience after the death of her mother.  She learns what it means to be chinese and how one is chinese.  She learns secrets her mother had kept her whole life.  She learns about herself and most of all, who she is and how she became that way.  Amy Tan has really been able to write the stories of 4 women and lead them all together in the end and the stories of 4 daughters and do the same at the end.  The beginning was a bit confusing as to who was who and who was speaking when, but as you got to know the characters it because more like knowing one friend from another.  It all became tied together with grand strings that Amy Tan has been able to weave wonderfully.
B00003CX95|4.0|Very heroic, very powerful, very realistic.  This is a strong and very solid film.
B00006G8G1|2.0|Well I waited for this for so long now, finally got it. Disapointed. It gave me a headache to watch, its much better if you don't watch it and just listen to it. <BR>For whatever reason they keep flipping the camera around never showing the same angle for more than 1 second. Or every 2 beats or so they show a different angle. It would have been great if they did multiple angles instead.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When the old Tears for Fears hit \\"Head Over Heels\\" kicks in, early on in the movie, you're taken quite by surprise. Not because it's another case of trying to show a bit of retro cool by referencing the 80's but because it fits in so well. The fact that the scene is in slow motion should be naff but in fact it is close to the best placement of a song in a movie in ages.<br /><br />Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie that will leave you with a smile on your face, despite its bittersweet ending. While being startingly original, it does reference other movies (Harvey, The Sixth Sense) but doesn't seem like a second rate copy or a \\"re-imagining\\" for that matter (take note Mr Burton). It certainly deserves a wider audience than it got on release in the cinema with a groundbreaking performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a wonderfully understated performance from Drew Barrymore.<br /><br />Richard Kelly can join such young directors as Spike Jonze and Paul Thomas Anderson who buck the trend of what is wrong with so much in American cinema, namely cliched and rehashed pap for the masses. It's important that we cherish movies like these as they have become so rare - a true classic!!
B000005QH3|5.0|This is a classic movie that is as much social commentary as car chase.  I remember watching this on a Saturday matinee on my local television station (long before the advent of cable television) and was mesmerized.<br />I recently purchased the VHS version and it was just as sweet twenty years later.<br />The premise isn't much: the main character, former member of society now riding on the fringe, has to get a car to San Francisco in 15 hours.  Load up on amphetamines and off we go.  The 'plot' is merely a vehicle for the ride.    <br />The car chase scenes are great and realistic (none of the special effects laden hocus pocus you see today) and the cinematography of the West is beautiful.  The characters, from the DJ who plays mystical guide to the helpers the driver meets in the desert, show life on the fringe.  I'm sure on some level this is a mystical, metaphorical journey of sorts but to me it is simply fun to watch.<br />The soundtrack is absolutely great.  It is kind of the O Brother Where Art Thou of the 70s -- the one that missed the radar.  It isn't music you hear on the radio and it certainly isn't mainstream in any fashion but it sure is good.  <br />I give this five stars quite simply because of the cinematography, the cast of characters and the music.  Well worth the visit.  They just don't make films like this anymore.
B000059PPN|3.0|This movie was as incoherent as most of Fulci's films, and the script was pretty typical of his work as well. The gore was good, but a little fake looking. In fact, with the plot and acting the way they were, there was just barely enough gore to hold my attention.<BR>THbtC is definately worth watching, and for those of you who are Fulci/Foreign/Horror movie fans (as I am), this is one that's worth owning. Just don't expect to be blown away by it.
6300213714|5.0|This Walter Hill Masterpiece, takes place on the mean streets of new York City in the 1970's. After a meeting in the Bronx that went totally wrong, after the Warriors were accused of killing the leader of the Riff's, there was no choice but to bop their way back to The Sand's of Coney Island. Ahh but this is no ordinary trip back home, as the Warriors are traveling with a price on their heads, along the way they encounter angry cops, punks, fires, baseball bats, knives and guns, all the ingredients, for the B-Movie enthusiast.  Determination, heart, and street smarts, their only weapons, bring them back home, only to be met with one last challenge. <BR>     This is an awesome classic, grab your chips and soda, have a seat and enjoy, you will be glad you did.

B00005QB9A|1.0|If there was a minus star, this movie would get it.  Am I crazy, or what? Last night I started watching this movie, which I had rented on DVD.  OK-- now my problem is this.  While the movie had sound-- music, chairs being moved, crowds shouting in the background, when the charactors spoke, their lips moved and nothing came out.  This went on and on, till I jumped forward to the middle of the movie, and it was the same there.  Did I get a faulty copy?  Blockbuster only had one copy, so that was it.<br />From the reviews, I get the idea that this movie is very good, but frankly, I'm at a loss.  What gives with the lip work?
B000063CMK|5.0|pain of salvation always knows how to innovate...This album is different from the others, very dark and very progressive...they play with different elements like metric, tempo, harmony and melody in their own way...nobody does this...The lyrics are...kicking, like always, and Daniel Gildenlow`s voice is remarkable...definitely as must have for any progresive metal fan...
0553573403|2.0|Sure the man can write.  He can write circles around lots of the contemporary fantasy writers pumping out pulp.  Trouble is, he's spinning too many plates, and obviously trying to create the kind of moral universe in which he'd LIKE to live in.  Lewd sex everywhere, anytime, between any partners.  Inscest, rape, and more references to bastardization than you would think possible--unless you had 3 books of nearly a thousand pages each to liberally sprinkle throughout every chapter.  Now you're getting the idea.<br />  There are many characters very well drawn.  Too many.  Most characters we think evil are shown to have endearing flaws in their makeup, and the \\"good\\" folk are sure to take their virtues to the extreme to make them look foolish.  Of course, life, and people are often that way.  However, coupled with the constant violence, this book is like watching a contempoary action flick for every hour it takes to read the thing.  It's a trial.<br />  It's certainly NOT for younger audiences.  Parents beware for your children's sake.
0790739356|1.0|You know when you're sitting around on a Saturday afternoon, and some pathetically terrible, 1980's sci-fi movie comes on and it's SO bad that you end up watching it all?  That's exactly what happened to me with Soldier, but this movie was made in 1998!!<br />This is the kind of movie, acting, and directing that gives sci-fi a bad name outside a few franchises, and ensures we don't get much in the way of original movies.  Kurt Russell packs wide-eyed looks into the camera as a substitute for acting; the director uses generic music and sudden and *dramatic* slow-motion shots to add 'feeling' to the movie.  The world is eternally dark and gloomy, only lit by the constant over-bright fires.<BR>Kurt Russell is too big a name for this movie, and none of the other parts are done any justice by the terrible acting.<br />One of the worst movies I've seen in a LONG time!  Ranks up there with Battlefield Earth and Lost in Space.
B00005N5SF|5.0|Both of these episodes share one thing in common:  they boldly went where no network program had gone before, in terms of ... bypassing the censors.  \\"Wink of an Eye\\" is the one in which comely Kathie Brown (the real-life Mrs. Darren McGavin) is seen brushing her hair beside William Shatner while Shatner sits on the edge of his bed pulling on his boot, and \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" had T.V.'s first interracial kiss (William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols).  Neither of these things may seem like that big of a deal today, but in 1968, let me tell you...!<br />\\"Wink\\" is an episode that makes little sense, but is thoroughly enjoyable.  The entire race of the planet Scalos seems to have disappeared, without explanation.  All that remains there is an occasional odd insect buzzing  -  which follows the landing party back to the Enterprise, after which Captain Kirk suddenly disappears from the bridge, in full view of the crew.  What's really happened to him is the same thing that happened to the Scalosians, several of whom are now on board  -  he's speeded-up a thousand times, now moving too fast to be detected by anyone not accelerated at the same rate.  Alien leader Kathie Brown, like all alien women, has taken a fancy to the charismatic Kirk, and intends to keep him with her after freezing the entire Enterprise crew and stealing his starship to move on to greener pastures.  Forgetting the built-in logic problem of how matter accelerated to such an impossible speed keeps from falling apart by intense friction, this is still a pretty good little story, fascinating to watch, and Kathie Brown is a knockout, in addition to being a decent actress.<br />\\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" is a great episode, written by one of Outer Limits' best contributors, Meyer Dolinsky.  The Enterprise finds itself summoned to a previously believed to be uninhabited planet, populated by beautiful people affecting ancient Greek costume and architecture.  They call themselves Plato's Stepchildren, supposedly devoted to nothing but lofty philosophy  -  but in reality, they are telekinetic demigods, whose seeming immortality and incredible power has dragged them down into sadistic decadence.  Their power and immortality does have one terrible price  -  it makes them hemophiliacs, and their medical knowledge is dreadfully inadequate, so Dr. McCoy is commanded to remain behind with them.  When he refuses, Plato's Stepchildren force several of the Enterprise crew into cruelly degrading situations, and unleash the full force of their fury.<br />The story is great, and so are the scenery and the guest stars.  Liam Sullivan is the Caligula-like Parmin, head of the planet, with the always sexy Barbara Babcock as his aristocratically sadistic mate.  Best of all is famous dwarf actor Michael Dunn as the planet's whipping-boy, who helps the Enterprise defeat the evil Platonians.  Dunn  -  best known as Dr. Loveless in The Wild, Wild West  -  had a phenomenal singing voice, and usually got to use it in his numerous 1960s guest appearances, as he does here in fine style.
0553573403|5.0|I picked the book off the shelf, and smiled as I realized how long it was. Long books don't affect me at all, but this one seemed like it might be a challenge. It wasn't, but this is one of the best fantasy books I've read. Sure, there were times when things were a bit slow, but sometimes life is slow as well.<br />The characters were complex. You can never really tell who is bad and who is good (with a few exceptions), and that makes the story indecisive and keeps you reading.<br />The world the book is set in is realistic as well and interesting. It had simialr qualities to ours, but was unique in its own way.<br />All in all, this book was a fantastic read, and the next two, while longer and heavier, are just as good, if not better. So have fun reading, and remember, when you want to pick the book up, use your knees not your back. That kind of weight can kill a person's back!
B00005NVDI|4.0|...some people just keep on pluggin' the same old paranoia.<br />\\"That Which Survives\\" suffers from terrible cheapness, though it benefits from an interesting performance by Lee Meriwether as the image of the last surviving member of a long-dead alien race, Losira, who is now nothing more than a computerized planetary defense system...for an entirely extinct race, that can no longer benefit from it.  Losira begins appearing and disappearing aboard the Enterprise, killing various crew members and performing acts of sabotage.  Kirk and Crew go on an alien hunt on the nearest planet, and there also encounter the strange woman, whom they correctly surmise is some sort of lethal hologram.  The story hasn't got much plot, but it holds your attention, and Lee Meriwether was always first-rate eye-candy.<br />\\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" is a great episode, if heavy-handed.  Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin are the last surviving members of two severely prejudicial races living on the planet Charon, their polarized attitudes evident even on their very bodies:  one is white on the right side and black on the left, the other black on the right side and white on the left.  Antonio's race is the oppressed proletariat class, Gorshin's the decadent bourgeois  -  Antonio seeks asylum on board the Enterprise, and Gorshin, a Charonian policeman, demands his return for trial on several crimes.  The aliens begin infecting the Enterprise with their enflamed rhetoric, and prove to be utterly consumed by hatred of each other and ruthless in the extreme as to achieving their separate goals.<br />What's best in this episode are the performances of the two guest stars, the fiery Gorshin especially, and the all too memorable finale in which the perpetual antagonists deliberately throw themselves into eternal warfare rather than work out their differences  -  even once they know their home planet has completely destroyed itself in precisely the same useless conflict, and they, themselves,are its only surviving remnants.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I picked the CD off of the rack, I thought that it would be another generic girl &quot;rocker&quot; trying to make her way in a pop world. My assumption was almost correct. Avril is a girl rocker trying to make her way in a pop music world, but she is anything but generic. Her music covers a variety of types: soulful, playful, rock, a bit of pop, and a lot of a new class, Avril style. There's something about her voice and her lyrics that set herapart from the others. SO, here's a blow-by-blow look at her music.<br />Losing Grip is a rock song that captures the emotion of a person who wasn't there for her when she needed it. At first, it sounds like wonderful music with nonesense lyrics, but once you listen, everything comes together.<br />Complicated seems to be the odd one out on the CD, almost like it was made for radio. The punk sound to it makes it completely different than the rest of the CD. PLus, you probably already know the somg anyway.<br />Sk8er Boi is a pop song about a girl who turns a boy down because her friends don't like him. He thens becomes a rock star while she ends up a single mother. THe whole song is just delightful to listen to.<br />I'm With You brings out the modernized bluesy tunes of Avril's voice. The lyrics are true, harsh but true, and the song is a masterpiece all together.<br />Mobile is a song about change. Out of control change that leaves you reeling. The lyrics and the music bring the song together and leave you smiling.<br />Anything But Ordinary is a different kind of song, Avril style. She sings about her life, and where she wants to be. The song is unlike anything you've ever heard, and for me, that song was the only reason I bought the CD, although I like all the songs now.<br />Things I'll Never Say is another Avril style song. She sings about her boyfriend and wishes that she has about him and her life. The song is upbeat, but kind of sad, and it's a great song to dance around your room with.<br />My World is a fast song about where Avril grew up and her life. Napanee, a 5000 population town in Canada is where it takes place. The song has catchy lyric and good music.<br />I only told about the best songs. All the others are wonderful, but these are the ones that stand out hte most. I hope that you enjoy the CD as much as I have.ong about where Avril grew up and her life.

0684847817|4.0|The first thing that strikes you about this book is the pure beauty!  The unique cover and way the book is bound, The Good Faeries is on one side, turn it over and The Bad Faries are there.  Reading the book from just one cover, you'll have to turn it upside down when you reach the other section. This book is, from start to finish seemingly written, designed, and imagined by the fae themselves. Brian Froud is definitely communicating with these magical beings.  The names and art work bring their personalities to life so vividly.  You'll find there is a fairy who causes any sort of mischief from that one sock that always disappears from the dryer, to your toast hitting the floor butter side up.  Touching, lovely, hilarious, and at times a little scary, this is one of the best books I have ever seen on the fae.  Brian Froud is truly gifted not only with artistic genius, but with the ability to see beyond our world and take us there with him.
0375703861|5.0|She's gorgeous. This is her first novel. It's fabulous: filled with engaging characters and perceptive insights...<br />I'm green with envy. <br />But that won't keep me from recommending the book highly and eagerly awaiting her next work...<br />Go, Zadie. You're blessed.
B00000IOSU|5.0|The hardest position to be in a band is not the one you would think.  I mean, sure, you have to have the instrumental ability to play one, but the frontman really has the most difficult job...the job of communicating to the listener...communicating in ways that communication does not normally take form.  Listening to music is an escape...and very few can make it an escape that we will want to return to.  <br />Sarah MacLachlan is one of the most gifted in the industry at communicating her emotions, and getting a dynamic response.  Mirrorball is a summation of all the best emotion she has communicated, and the emotion that listeners have had the strongest responses to.  Yes, most live CDs have the tendency to have the audience cheering in the background, but it's very rare to have an audience made up of thousands of individuals...each feeling like they are the only other person in the room with the person performing.  The audience in this CD has this response, and you really can actually tell by their responses, namely to the tracks 'Building a Mystery', 'I Love You' and 'I Will Remember You', all tracks of powerful emotion and poetry.<br />Sarah is a beautiful person, and she really has developed and matured into an amazing singer, lyricist and musician over the years.  This CD shows the milestone upon which she has stumbled.  Maybe, very soon, another live CD showing another milestone stumbled upon will come out, because Sarah MacLachlan is a milestone of grand proportions and should be remembered for as long as possible.  <br />It's poets like her that are keeping music an art.
B000068TPN|5.0|My husband and I just watched this movie tonight. It really struck home. I was young when we got married, very young. I was in love. He was seven years older than me and in the military at Ft. Benning, Ga when he had to go overseas for the second time to Vietnam. Before he got on orders I became pregnant. This was a hard time for me to have him go to a place where there was real fighting going on. This movie brought back the real life of not only the men who had to go over and fight this war but the wives who were behind caring for the children and trying to keep the candles burning for their loved ones to return. I give this movie more than a five stars. It deserves more than a ten plus rating and more than two thumbs up. This is the first real war movie that I have enjoyed watching. Mel Gibson and the other soldiers showed true sadness and strength. It was reflected and mirrored in their eyes and on their faces. I hope that it will get some kind of awards or more recognition for the hard work that was put into the making of this film. I could understand and feel what the women were going through. This movie is true to life. Everyone should see this movie and remember what our men went through. It is a movie that should be shared by others. The emotion and trepidation that was on these men faces will always remain as a memory in my heart. A class all in itself!!!
B00003CXB7|5.0|M*A*S*H is one of the zaniest and most intelligent satires ever produced by Hollywood.  This is a war movie in which only two shots are fired -- as signals in a football game.  It is a masterpiece of wider appeal -- even to veterans -- than is suggested by its setting in Korean War military hospitals, or by its director's explicit aim of promoting liberal opposition to the Vietnam war during the '60s and '70s.<br />The 2002 two-disk M*A*S*H special edition from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in many ways is a benchmark for DVD releases of cult movies.  Picture and sound quality are high.  The special feature content is entertaining and insightful.<br />This content includes extensive retrospective comment by director Robert Altman, producer Ingo Preminger, former studio boss Richard Zanuck, scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr, actors including Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Sally Kellerman, Tom Skerritt, John Schuck and Gary Burghoff, and medical veterans of the Korean War.  We see the 30th anniversary M*A*S*H reunion at Fox, and presentation of a studio life achievement award to Altman.<br />The special content gives fascinating insights into the driving half-mad genius that so often makes a great director, and of egos and bigheartedness in movie making.<br /><br />Almost everyone, from the scriptwriter to the studio executives and the actors, lined up against the director at some time.  Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould once even tried to get Altman fired, fearing that he would damage their careers.  In the M*A*S*H special edition features they eat their words and graciously pay tribute to Altman.  Former studio boss Richard Zanuck says that until Altman came along other directors were afraid of the screenplay or didn't like it.  'Altman came in, and seemed unruly enough to be able to understand this subject matter.'<br />M*A*S*H was made on a shoestring budget with Fox's Century Ranch standing in for Korea.  It emerged from chaotic creative tension as an enormous artistic and financial success.  Altman accepted a salary of only $75,000.  His son Mike is reputed to have made more money from writing the lyric to the keynote ballad, 'Suicide Is Painless', with Johnny Mandel.  Altman kept costs down by casting the movie with mostly unknown and out-of-work actors.  14 of the movie's 30 speaking roles were played by actors making their screen debut.  Shooting finished three days ahead of schedule in 1969, and almost half a million dollars under budget.  M*A*S*H went on to earn more than $80 million at the box office, a Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Oscar (for the heavily reworked script of formerly blacklisted scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr), and to inspire a long-running popular TV series.<br />This is a rare thing: a five star classic movie in a five star DVD release.artistic and financial success.

B00005OAIE|2.0|Unlike superior singer/songwriters such as Ryan Adams,Pete Yorn,<BR>Badly Drawn Boy,and others,young lad John Mayer has some missing elements:sophistication,meaningfulness,and originality.To be fair,Mayer's voice is decent although it'd be nice if he stopped doing Dave Matthews imitations and found his own voice.His guitar playing is passable at best.But the songs are another story.The lyrics seem written out of a ninth grader's notebook.No strength or depth.The first single \\"No Such Thing\\" is laughable as we get a amaturish tune about being the \\"un-cool kid\\" in school.Oh whoppie! Of all the [messed] up things in the world and in life and this dude's whining about high school! Stop the insanity! <br />After a good listen of \\"Room To Squares\\" it's very obvious that like Alicia Keys,Vanessa Carlton,and eh...Michelle Branch,Mayer is a immature,shallow high school kid that thinks copying their folks' records makes them deep while they write high school-level lyrics and play instruments at a beginner's level.No matuartion and real depth.Because he's groomed to be a \\"teen idol\\" and his music is plain and unoffensive,Mayer will do alright as far as commerically and press-wise.But REAL music listeners know better.<br />\\"Room For Squares\\" isn't god-awful but WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ARTIST DEVOLPMENT??? Stop throwing these kids out here when they haven't had any devolpement and experience!
0345345061|5.0|If you loved \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" you should enjoy this book.  The Tolkein Reader contains \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" a fun story about Farmer Giles, a man not inclined to heroism who captures a dragon of emperial lineage, \\"Tree and Leaf\\" with Tolkein's essay on fairy stories and the delightful story \\"Leaf by Niggle\\".  The Adventures of Tom Bombadil is full of lighthearted poetry.  Included are several other stories.<br />My advice?  Buy it!!!  If you truly enjoy John Ronald Reuel Tolkein's work you won't regret your purchase.
B0000636UN|2.0|I've always had a strange relationship with Sheryl Crow.I remember digging her 1993 debut,&quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;,with it's glossy yet strangely compelling pop-rock tunes.But her next two albums('96s Sheryl Crow and '98s The Globe Sessions) were high on nice hooks and good ideas but low on actually realized songs.But I still semi-liked her.But I shall say that Sheryl never really got on my nerves but she just struck me as an artist that would do anything to keep her name out there...<br />Maybe I had a point after giving Sheryl's long-awaited fourth disc,&quot;C'Mon C'Mon&quot; a whirl.Like some other reviewers noted,Ms. Crow sounds a little amatuerish and insecure on here.Such duds as the simple-minded &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;(armed with a clunky hook and predictible chords),the I'm-deseprate-for-a-hit,VH1-aimed first<BR>single &quot;Soak In The Sun&quot;,the so bland it hurts &quot;You're An Original&quot;(my boy Lenny Kravitz couldn't even save this one!),and &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; don't sound done by a veteran peformer that's seen her share of struggle.But rather by a dippy,success-starved upstart.Sheryl seems above such middle of the road material as this.<BR>And my intial assertment that Sheryl would do almost anything to stay afloat in today's (mindless) music scene's seems pretty correct on &quot;C'Mon C'Mon&quot;.The fourty something Crow dresses up like an aging Britney Spears in the album's photography(adorned in tight jeans and bikinis;nice to look at but this is the same women who asserts one track &quot;All our pop stars look like porn&quot;)and an attempt to keep folks intrested Keith Richards,Lenny Kravitz,Emmylou Harris,Natalie Maines(Dixie Chicks),Kid Rock,Stevie Nicks,Scott Weiland,Don Henley,Gwyneth Paltrow(YES! Gwyneth Paltrow!),Liz Phair,and Kravitz guitarist Craig Ross all appear on &quot;C'Mon C'Mon&quot;.So what's the matter Sheryl? Scared no one finds you intresting enough to just check out your records just to hear YOU? Awkward poses like this make you wonder why such a seasoned pro as Crow is resorting to such predictible,record company tactics.<br />But that's the pop world in 2002:baffling,dull,and pointless.But I suspected better for Sheryl.She actually has talent.(That's not a requirement in today's mainstream music).<BR>I guess our strange musical relationship continues...
0060930187|5.0|I cringed when reading the suicidal episodes that Esther Greenwood(Sylvia Plath's alterego) put herself through. I'm thinking, \\" Why would a witty, tall, charming, intelligent girl on college scholarship and great grades and a loving mother want to end it all?\\"<br />I'm a 28 year old male who finds witty and cynical girls like Esther charming so when I came upon the multiple suicide attempts, I'm cringing pissed off thinking, \\"Why?\\"<br />I would be cheating you if I told you - read it and find out. The book was a normal coming of age type book for the first 100 pages, and then all of a suddent Esthter talks of the 19 razors blades she keeps in her purse, and then the entire premise of the novel deepened tenfold and took an unforgettable 180 degree turn into the enigmatic bell jar. When she vividly imagines slitting her wrists I felt nauseous and about to puke wanting to throw the book down. Needless to say, I really got into the novel and the characters -undoubtedly because they're all real people in Plath's life... This classic is deeply disturbing, yet refreshingly redeeming & reinvigorating.<br />FYI: A must read - not just for chics.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Having purchased Tomb Raider sight unseen, I was a little weary of yet another made-from-video-game movie. The truth is that if Resident Evil had never been a video game, it still would have been a great movie. I never played the video game but I loved the movie: large corporations replace national superpowers, intelligent computers have more control over facilities than any human engineer would design, and genetically engineered viruses have the ability to reanimate the dead. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through the movie to its end and there are plenty of surprises. Resident Evil may never be a classic but it is worth watching more than once.
B0000669JL|5.0|This CD is aptly named; Bob Marley's music has touched the world, and this compilation does even more justice to his brilliance than the original release of &quot;Legend&quot; -- better, crisper sound and &quot;Exodus,&quot; in its complete form. With sweet songs like &quot;Is This Love, &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; (a recording of the famous live performance), the empowering &quot;Get Up Stand Up,&quot; and the infectious &quot;Jamming,&quot; there is a song for nearly any mood.<br />I have taken this CD with me everywhere: to the store, on short trips, and on trips overseas. Whether you're on an airplane or sitting at home, whether you're happy or depressed, chances are one of these songs will speak to you. <br />The old &quot;Legend&quot; was great, but this reissue is better. The CD contains a nice mix of his songs, and it will no doubt remain a popular and well-respected album.
B000002H97|4.0|This was the first MetallicA album (infact, the first Metal album) I ever bought (I came from a country where Western Music is yet to make any significant inroads). The only songs that I appealed to me initially were \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\". But as time progressed I started liking the faster songs \\"Holier Than Thou\\", \\"Through the Never\\", and \\"Struggle Within\\".<br />Then, I bought Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning.. and then I understood what those old-school Metallica fans are talking about! The \\"Black Album\\" is definitely a nice place to start if you haven't listened to MetallicA at all. But, Master of Puppets is definitely the best MetallicA album and one must listen MOP to experience the REAL MetallicA. Even though MetallicA \\"sort of\\" sold out with this album, they still have made very good music. But all that changed with the release of Load and Reload ...
B000001DTM|4.0|I just finished my review of All You Can't Leave Behind, and as I wrote it I became increasingly aware of the similarities between it's creation and Achtung Baby's.  Both albums successfully refashioned and invigorated the band after periods of excess: for AYCLB it was the failed bombast of the Popmart Tour, and for AB it was the arrogance following the Rattle and Hum movie.  Still, they're both completely different animals; Achtung Baby was an entirely new direction, while AYCLB is a return to roots after a decade of experimentation begun by Achtung Baby itself.  I couldn't help but return 10 years earlier to review this disc; after all, its by far the better of the two.  AYCLB is a fine rock album, but Achtung is visionary. <br />Achtung Baby was one of the pioneering rock/eurodance crossover albums, and for U2 it was as drastic a transition as night and day.  It came on the heels of their infatuation with American music, blues and folk.  The result was The Joshua Tree, one of the all-time greatest albums, but Achtung Baby holds its own quite well against that masterpiece.  The European influence (it was made in Berlin) is evident throughout the album, and gives it a totally fresh sound.  Most of the songs deal with transition (like Zoo Station), social and spiritual corruption (thanks goes out to another reviewers genius interpretation of \\"Until the World Ends\\" as Judas confessing to Jesus) and the failing of love (Love is Blindness.)  Lyrically, its amazing: the metaphors are entirely original and deep; fierce images and dual meanings abound (take The Fly: is it about a despairing lover or a disillusioned priest?) The songs are tight, with compelling production, raging bass lines (check out Mysterious Ways!) and the Edge's most cutting-edge guitar work.  The album's only downside is the lack of a killer ballad, and that it begins to drag around So Cruel (the only throw-away song on the entire disc.)  And- in my opinion- One, although a fine song, is not nearly as moving or important as so many people seem to think (I may be crucified by readers for that one.)  But anyway, believe the hype: this is among the best rock albums of the 90's.
B0000508U6|4.0|I love this album. I love the melancholy and haunting feel it has. Its ALMOST like listening to Pink Floyd. What i mean by that is that this album will have you pondering about your life. It takes you on thoughtful journey's. It will have you thinking about life. I got this album when it was first released and i can honestly say i havent stopped listening to it. They are such a great band. If you've seen the video they made for the great song &quot;Trouble&quot; you'll see how artistic these guys are. You dont see many videos like that anymore. BUY this album.
B000001E18|3.0|For me, Zooropa was the one U2 disc that I had written off by word of mouth:  All of my friends and favorite critics considered it \\"U2's dissapointment.\\"  I picked it up after seeing it in a discount bin just to round off my collection.  I plopped it into the CD player, and prepared to go off to do other things, but I was held- and immediately fascinated.  I listened to it 2 times in a row, hardly doing anything but rereading the sleeve.  I was more than pleasantly surprised: I love this album!<br />Don't get me wrong: there are some significant flaws.  But I'd rather get them out of the way quickly; the strengths are much more fun here.  Sequencing is a huge problem: the album never sounds conceived together.  It almost sounds like a B-sides collection: in fact, some of the weaker tracks ARE obviously B-side material (Babyface, Dirty Day, The First Time) and then there's The Wanderer, such a strangely out-of-place song that its puzzling how it merited inclusion.  But, then again, Zooropa itself is an out-of-place album...<br />Flaws aside, this is U2's most inventive album ever.  Much more groundbreaking than even Actung Baby (a fairly groundbreaking album), they successfully merged eurodance and pop with these tracks.  With elements that are entirely new.  Zooropa is a collage introduction that is perfectly described by the sleeve art.  Numb is terrifically catchy and irreverent.  Some Days are Better than Others is such a laid-back ode to the philosophy of \\"take life as it comes\\" that it should be standard on todays cd player to defeat road rage.  And then theres Lemon, U2 most \\"epic\\" song of the 90's, and my personal favorite U2 song since \\"One Tree Hill.\\"  <br />Not every disc can be perfect, but Zooropa just goes to show that with great bands like U2 even their flawed discs can be as interesting as their classics.  Definately recommended.
0312243022|5.0|I loved this book.  Michael Cunningham did a great job of describing women's feelings and inner thoughts.  I had never read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, but I did after reading &quot;The Hours&quot;.  I found &quot;The Hours&quot; much easier and more pleasant to read.  I suffered through reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; only so I could fully appreciate how masterfully Michael Cunningham transformed it into &quot;The Hours&quot;.  The prose are poetic and the story while not uplifting is interesting.
B000000IUK|5.0|This is the best and most enduring rock album from the 80's.  It can't really be said any clearer than that.  It has been over a decade, and this album sounds just as fresh and relevant today as it did when it first came out.  Deeply rooted in American rock and blues (this was created during U2's period of intense infatuation with American music) the entire disc is a varied and intense sonic journey, with memorable but complex arrangements, the Edge's most melodic guitar work and Bono at the peak of his abilities as a songwriter and vocalist.<br />Most of the tracks deal with personal relationships, and I've come back to them time and time again in different periods of my life for reflection and focus.  Poetry abounds throughout the disc, and I think thats its timeless quality: the lyrics connect with something very emotional and basic in all of us.  My personal favorite, One Tree Hill, is a perfect example: Just try and not by moved by the spiritually soaring, reflective lyrics about our mortality, and what we must do with our life in the meantime.  This is one powerful CD.  <br />As a side note, I have the Gold CD version.  Although I don't have cutting edge audiophile technology, I haven't noticed any difference in the sound quality over a typical release.  Still, The Joshua Tree is one of my favorites of my CD collection, and so its nice to have it in special edition form.  But other than bragging rights, I see no reason to get the Gold version...
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it at the theater.  I also had a lot of questions about the story and the characters.  Crowe answers all in the bootleg dvd.  The uncut version of the film is excellent and explains the relationship between Penny Lane and Russell much better.  Excellent entertainment and I highly recommend it to any fan of Kate Hudson's or Goldie Hawn.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Pop is an album of extreme contradictions.  It is also U2's bleakest album: It finds Bono at his most cynical, and his most desperate.  Nearly all of the songs are about losing ones faith in Love, God and Self.  Put these sentiments, among Bono's most introspective, against the ridiculous backdrop of retro-American, Disco-trance produced Rock & Roll, and you have the enigma that is \\"Pop.\\"  At its best, the songs are irony-dripping adrenaline-pumping tunes with all the clever hooks and wit we've come to expect from U2 (Discotheque, Do You Feel Loved, Staring at the Sun, Staring at the Sun, Last Night on Earth, Please)- while at its worst are immature lyrical games with songs overproduced to within an inch of their sad lives (Miami, If You Wear that Velvet Dress, The Playboy Mansion.)  <br />The songs that work (the ones mentioned above) make the album worthwhile, without a doubt!  But some of these songs deserved much better.  If God Will Send His Angels is beautiful and heartbreaking at its core; but it is garishly ill-conceived in its production.  It would've worked much better as a straight, earnest 4-piece-band ballad.  And Mofo had potential, but was so relentlessly overworked all its life was pounded out.  <br />This album has some of the best songwriting U2 has ever had, which is why it's ultimately somewhat of a dissapointment.  Never have they done so little with so much.  Still, now it must be taken for what it is, and not what it should've been- and U2 have another disc in Pop that deserves many listens.
B00005JKG7|4.0|If it starts to get overcast in your town and a fog rolls in, you better run away as fast as you can. You never know if there will be dead fishermen coming in to catch some fish. The movie is corny, but has plenty of good thrills only John Carpenter can execute. Good movie. Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau are in the film. Who cares? I have crucial advice for a person to live by. Watch out for the mad fishermen who died before they were able to catch the 'big one'. I remember riding my bike as fast as I could to escape the fog one time. These old guys were chasing me with fishhooks and fishing poles. Scary stuff, indeed.

Susie is lingering in between heaven and earth looking for some sort of closure to her vicious and untimely death.  A beautiful rendering of family and loss, yet insightful and sad.  A must-read!
6305159432|5.0|Dolph Lordgren kicks mucho buttero in this movie. Nicknamed &quot;Red Scorpion,&quot; the lord went against his own people to save others. Bar fights, explosions and gun battles are common in this goddage movie. Yes, lordage.
B00006BTCA|4.0|After hearing the song &quot;PDA&quot; from their single, I was blown away.  Yes, there is a huge Joy Division influence here, but the songs move much faster, cleaner, brighter and hooks are everywhere!  This is the best album I have heard thus far for 2002 and it keeps growing and growing on me.  I don't think there is a bad song on the whole album.  This is highly recommended!!
B00005QDW1|2.0|I can't believe this new album.  I never thought I'd be saying this about No Doubt, but I don't understand what happened. I really used to enjoy their music but this drastic change is just not so appealing.  Even to many other faithful listeners such as myself, their new record just doesn't seem like it belongs to this band.  If you liked No Doubt before, be forwarned that they just don't make them like they used to.
B00005JKJA|3.0|In one word, this movie is wierd.  I have no idea what <br />happened in the movie.  Here are some clues to solve the <br />mystery:<br />-Pay paticular attention in the beginning of the film; <br />at least 2 clues are revealed before the credits.<br />-Notice appearances of the red lampshade.<br />-Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kesher is <br />auditioning actresses for?  Is it mentioned again?<br />-An accident is a terrible event...notice the location <br />of the accident.<br />-Who gives a key, and why?<br />-What is felt, realized and gathered at the club: <br />Silencio?<br />-Did talent alone help Camilla?<br />-Notice the occurances surrounding the man behind <br />Winkies.<br />-Where is Aunt Ruth?<br />-At the end od the movie when Diane reaches in to her <br />nightstand drawer to grab the guin, there appears to be <br />a blue box in the drawer alongside the gun.<br />All clues are from the Hollywood movie store magazine.
0316776963|1.0|I heard an interview with David Sedaris' sister. She talked a lot about David and this book. It sounded great, so I picked it up that day. I anticipated a raw and witty story revealing the oddness of family life. However, what I got was a rant.<br />I can accept that it is not a novel, but a bunch of random thoughts. Still, I like to be compelled to at least read the next word. But, I found my self predicting the next line and trudging through the pages. <br />Whatever happened to character building? Who cares about these people? Lots of us have stories like these tucked away in our families (what not you?). Anyway, my point is that David Sedaris attempts ONLY to talk pretty. I can just picture him throwing words together and then sitting back with a grin saying, &quot;Oh yeah, I'm a laugh riot.&quot;<br />Don't waste your precious time.
B00005JKBC|4.0|it's a well-played movie. Great actors, new plot, major scenes. Oh well, am not here to talk about the story and all; I want to point out a single flaw in the movie. Hmmm... it's a HUGE mistake for the arabic-speakers. Let's see, when they shifted the scene to the one in Lebanon, 1984, a song was playing in the pub, remember? The song's for Clauda Al-Shimaly who is a Lebanese singer started early 90's and the song was famous around the same time!<br />I guess, the director got everything right except the song!<br />But don't miss it, just miss the song!
6305320802|5.0|The sound quality on the DVD edition of this classic is wonderful.  After every viewing, you'll end up walking around your house belting out the songs at the top of your lungs.
B000068TPN|4.0|War movies can go one of three ways, in my humble opinion:  overly wrought and maudlin; inaccurate and silly in presentation; or straightforward and personal.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" presents the story of a group of men with Gibson at the helm as a a personal drama.  The \\"difference\\" this film has from \\"Platoon,\\" or \\"Hamburger Hill\\" is that it approaches its story from the man and not the soldier.  We learn about the minds and the souls of the men in the uniforms.  It has been attempted in other films about Vietnam, but I think this one really hits the nail on the head (or gets as close as any I've seen).<br />This is a gory film - but war isn't pretty.<br />This is an emotional film - war is emotional.<br />This is a frightening film.<br />There is certainly an element of positive slant with regard to the U.S. - but by God - this film is an American film and it should have such a slant.  It isn't a documentary.  However, Wallace does do a good job of presenting the Viet Cong as humans with feelings and emotions too.  While not perfectly balanced, it is very even handed on the whole.<br />As the viewer, you certainly empathize with the soldiers who do their duty and you admire the leadership and direction of their captain.  It is not hard to see why these men followed him into battle with respect and honor.<br />I highly recommend this film.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|This is a mildly entertaining flick that was released to capitalize on the newest animation technology.  The story really drags and Mike Meyers' Scottish accent starts to grate on the nerves after about 15 minutes.  John Lithgow, on the other hand, is hilarious with his deadpan delivery.  The funniest scene in the movie is between Lithgow's Prince Fahrquod and the Gingerbread Man.  Skip to that scene and you've seen all there is to see.
B000002OX7|5.0|The BEST!! Who album ever, Plus extra tracks  on this great CD.<br />This is the only Who record that had at least more air play of all songs with exception to \\"Pinball Wizard\\" from Tommy and \\"Sqeeze Box\\" from Who by numbers.<br />You won't be fooled!<br />Get this CD!
B000066C87|1.0|I can't believe how bad this movie really was. I picked it up in the video store intrigued by the many oscar nominations and the muder mystry plot, boy was I let down! at the beggining the movie seemed to have good potential, but half an hour in i asked my self \\"is there a point to this movie yet?\\" the answer is no, the only point came about an hour later the the head guy was finally killed. Don't be tricked as i was by the trailer thinking this is a murder mystry, it is not, the trailer shows scenes from the last half hour. this is a terriable movie, the only redeming qualities were the performances. but even thoughs couldn't save this sorry excuse for a movie
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors first album and my favorite one of all the Doors in my collection.<br />No freaky overdubs here , a true classic of rock'n roll history.<br />I would recomend reading the book \\"No one here gets out alive \\"<br />while listening to this CD in order to get the full effect of this music.<br />Enjoy!
B00005JKZT|5.0|The movie will jump back and forth from book 3 to 4, and Shelob is being pushed back to the third film and it looks as if part of book 5 will be in this film > It does make sense when you understand that Frodo was at Cirith Gorgor chapter 3 of book 4 while Gandalf was at Isengard with Saruman chapter 10 of book 3 >
B00003CXRM|5.0|I rented it first, just to see what all the hullaballoo was about.  Now I'm buying it.<br />You don't have to love the Coen Brothers to love this movie, although it wouldn't hurt.  Anyone familiar with the 'exploding man' in Raising Arizona or the 'evil woodgrinder' in Fargo will realize that there has to be *something* twisted coming in this one.  When it does come, it's pretty tame, but by then you're hooked.<br />It's hard to find any fault.  Clooney is perfect as the loquacious and fussy Ulysses.  Goodman ditto as Cyclops.  Durning ditto as the slummin' southern governor.  Holly Hunter as Penelope doesn't get much screen time, but she makes the most of what she does get.  And then of course there's the music, which is just too good to be true.<br />The only thing that bothered me at all was that the brothers didn't 'bring me along gently' into the style of this particular story.  In Fargo, you don't realize what you're in for till it's too late.  In Raising Arizona the plot has you hooked early enough so you have to put up with the gore.  There's no similar 'upward path' in this.  Bang, five minutes into it, there's Clooney spouting his effortless and greasy brand of codswallop, and I found myself going &quot;This is supposed to be FUNNY?&quot;<br />Well, yeah, it was, and in fact, once you get used to it, it IS.  In fact, I haven't laughed this loud or this long since SLEEPER.  By the end I was so wound up in the Coen's brand of madcap humor that even the swimming dog scene put me into stitches.  Even such an unlikely subject as a roll-top desk turns out to be a screamer.<br />You HAVE to see it!
B000059ZLH|5.0|A week before purchasing this, I was fortunate enough to actually get to see Dream Theater in concert, and needless to say, it was amazing.  Your mind can bearly comprehend what you're actually seeing these guys do.  After that great show, I could never imagine that the magic, the essence of this experience could ever be captured on tape.  I was wrong.<br />This DVD is just perfect.  The cinematography is fantastic, allowing for you to see each musician from a multitude of camera angles, and the picture is clear as a bell.  I've read complaints about the recording not being loud enough, and I do see what they mean, but really it's no big deal.  That's where expensive, hi-tech stereo equipment comes in. :)<br />The DVD centers around Dream Theater's live performance of \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" at the Roseland show, intertwined with a nice little \\"music video\\" to help visualize the story.  The video's not really that great, but it serves its purpose.  The important thing here is the music.  Now, of course it would be nearly impossible to ever duplicate the magic that is SFAM, but this is about as good as it gets.  The boys put on a high-energy performance with spot-on precision and truckloads of emotion.  John Petrucci nearly lights his guitar on fire.  Watching him spit out those lightning-fast solos is just awe-inspiring, and even more impressive when you see that it's almost all flat-picked.  This guy is the master.  Mike's drumming is equally impressive, epecially on the outro to \\"Finally Free\\".  You get a good view from a camera behind him of his octopus-like fills.  When I saw them live, it was hard to see what he was doing from the floor, so it was really cool to actually be able to watch him play.  John Myung's playing is incredible to watch, too.  He may not get many opportunities to stand out in all the madness, but when you see him gracefully navigate the fretboard of that 6-string bass, you know he's freaky good.  All 4 members are in top form, and James LaBrie puts on a powerful performance. His duet with Theresa is especially good (that's a lot of vocal power there).  He's got a great stage presence too.  He's a wild man with that mic stand (at the concert, he nearly clipped John Myung in the head 2 or 3 times).  Just a perfect performance.<br />But wait, there's more! In addition to all this, you get over an hour of bonus material, including 5 extra songs (\\"A Change of Seasons\\", \\"Learning to Live\\", and the \\"Mind Beside Itself\\" trilogy), some behind-the-scenes footage, and hilarious audio commentary from Mike.  My only complaint?  No \\"Metropolis Part 1\\"!  Oh well.  You just can't have it all!<br />If I sound like a yammering idiot here, it's because I'm having a hard time putting the absolute perfection of this package into words.  The only way you can truly understand is to experience it for yourself.  Buy this, and let the magic resonate from your speakers.rie puts on a powerful performance.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Undoubtedly, every person reading this review has already seen the movie, probably in a theatre, or at least at home on VHS or DVD.  So you don't need me to tell you how spectacular the movie is, or how well acted, or how beautifully adapted from the book.  I give the movie 4 stars.<br />So how in the world can I give the DVD 5 stars, you ask?  Because of the special features, like nothing on any other DVD I've ever seen.  The interactive stuff is truly interactive, with all kinds of neat rewards for choosing the right answers, and neat punishments for choosing the wrong ones.  There's even a section about the Seven-Bottle Puzzle that was such a neat point in the book, but which was left out of the movie-- you have to have read the book to get the correct answer, a nice case of movie producer acknowledging his debt to author.  There's a very nice virtual 3-D tour of Hogwarts, including details you can barely make out during the movie itself.<br />My only complaint is that there are no interviews with the three major young actors, but that's minor.  On the whole, I love this 2-DVD set, and in some ways the second disk is the better of the two!
B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush was undoubtedly the greatest progressive band of the 70's.  They made music that was technical, but at the same time fun.  \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" was one of the many great albums Rush made in this time period, and it's one of their best.<br />The album starts off with the title track, a hard-rocking song with an awesome acoustic intro and outro.  Next up is the classic \\"Xanadu\\", a sprawling 11-minute epic, including an awesome 5-minute intro, varying tempos, excellent vocals, and very cool lyrics.  Just an all-around great song.  To balance out the epicness, this  song is followed by 3 shorter ones, \\"Closer to the Heart\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\", and \\"Madrigal\\", all of which are fantastic.  \\"Closer to the Heart\\" is the most popular song of the album.  It's great, but too short.  I heard a live version somewhere in which Geddy Lee added in a really cool bass solo.  Why didn't they just record it like that?  Oh well.  Anyway, the album closes with what I think is my favorite of the bunch, \\"Cygnus X-1\\".  Yet another epic, with some pretty cool sound effects, and great lyrics about getting sucked into a black hole.  Very strong album closer.<br />The musicians all put on a spectacular performance.  Alex Lifeson plays a lot more acoustic here than on other releases, making his already dynamic guitar work that much more interesting.  Neil Peart is a human drum machine, cranking out some very fast and complex beats (there's even some double bass in there).  And, Geddy Lee.  What can I say?  Great bassist, great singer.  He's just plain great.<br />If you love progressive music, \\"Farewell to Kings\\" is a must.  Its only flaw is that it's over much too fast.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Judged purely as a mystery story, this is a fabulous movie.  I guarantee you'll never guess 'whodunit.'  The characters are memorable, the dialogue (much of it improvised, according to the director) is barbed, the revelations are satisfying.<br />But.<br />It could have been so much better.  If only we had been allowed to get to know the most important characters more deeply.  If only we could have cared more about the murder victim.  If only the cleverness hadn't been allowed to overshadow the humanity of the characters.<br />While watching this, I couldn't help but recall how much I loved \\"Remains of the Day,\\" with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  In that movie the maids and butlers and housekeepers really do become real people for us, and we care immensely about what happens to them.  In contrast with that, the Gosford Park characters are rather two-dimensional, with a bit of 'cartoon' about them.  There's too much that's already familiar from any Agatha Christie story you've ever seen or read-- the villain who deserves to die, the back-stabbing spoiled children of the wealthy mansion owners, the society idols who refuse to acknowledge that their servants have feelings.<br />A bit more time spent on each major character would have overcome this.  Helen Mirren is an incredible actress and usually moves me greatly, but here she isn't given enough to work with, and I find myself curiously indifferent to the emotions she displays at the plot's climax.  She's convincing, but she never moves me.<br />Yes, it's a really good movie.  It could have been great.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is one HOT cd. Every dance club around the world needs to have this right at the top of every play list. There is not a single song that is not worth playing. <BR>Everying from the big smash \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" to the retro disco \\"Dancefloor\\" and then to the sexually charged \\"Come Into My World\\". Every song seems to \\"ooze\\" dance and the stuff that makes you feel good. Then you have the two sides of every coin: \\"Love At First Sight\\" is about basically falling in love at the first meeting. Then \\"Give It To Me\\" talks about \\"giving me what I want.\\"<BR>The whole cd is a retro look into the world of dance. A time when dance was just fun. Kylie brings disco back to the front and makes you want to go out, grab a partner, and get on the floor. <BR>I love dance music and this cd is better than any other \\"dance\\" music cd ever. \\"Fever\\" outshines \\"Living Proof\\" (Cher) and \\"GLORIA\\" (Gloria Estefan). <BR>GET THE FEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B00006690G|4.0|Marshall Mathers LP was Em's best album. Let me get that out of the way first. The Eminem Show is a great album. There are certain tracks that I love, like Drips, Superman, I Think My Dad's Gone Crazy, White America and (suprisingly) Hailie's Song. I think Obie Trice could possibly be the next huge thing, but he needs to get out on his own. Stay with Shady Records, but get his own album out! I think it was good idea to finally put Hailie on a song. He has talked about her for so long, and she makes the song funnier than it normally would've been...<BR>Eminem has his own style, that either you love or you don't. I know many people who love rap, that don't really like Em. I listen to all sorts of music, and rap isn't at the top of my list. I love metal, but I love Eminem's rhymes? Maybe I'm messed up too...
B00005JLEX|5.0|If you would go to a deserted island, and you could pick one tv show to watch over and over and over again, it would be Seinfeld. Instead of tape, there is the great possibility to add interviews, directors/actors commentary for every episode, bloopers, extendes/alternate/cut scenes, etc... This little invention is called DVD. And it would be the best dvd set yet (the best, Jerry! The best!).<br />However, you'll have to be Superman to get all 179 Seinfeld episodes on dvd. I craved, I've yearned. I've considered stalking Larry David. But I'm afraid the chance of George getting married is bigger than Seinfeld being released on DVD....
B00005JKJA|2.0|(** out of ...)<br />While `Lost Highways' strung us along like the Lynch junkies we are - `Mulholland Dr.' is a painful experience that is only kept alive by the enormous performances of the lead cast and some memorable supporting roles.<br />The young and alive Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in LA to try and get a job as an actress. Staying in her aunt's apartment she meets up with Rita (Laura Harring) who has lost her memory but has a ton of money on her and a single blue strange shaped key. The perfect mystery begins and Betty tries to help Rita discover her true identity.<br />The cause of film's failure is that it does not develop the devices that grabbed our attention at the start. There are many good ideas at play, yet Lynch decides to go down a route that we would find in one of the duller episodes of Twin Peaks (of which there where hardly any). However, `Mulholland Dr.' was originally a pilot episode for a now abandoned television series and this may explain the lack of development and the surprise that never comes. Clocking in at 145 minutes this film could well have been played out in 90.<br />Experimental it may be, but at the same time it is not a film that delivers on its promises. We don't mind wackiness, a story without meaning or quasi-dimensional worlds (that is why we watch Lynch movies!) but we do mind excellent ideas that are cast aside for more trivial and banal discoveries that serve no more of a function than to knit one scene to the next.. Arrrrggghhh it was amateur in so many ways. A sorry case of hit and miss.<br />The film is not all bad though. There are many funny moments, interesting predicaments and wonderful sets pieces. Notably, the hitman's attempt at keeping his work quiet, a scene involving a philosophical cowboy (keep an eye out because you see him once again oh yes!) and the weird concert.<br />All in all the film feels rough on the edges and has a rushed look to it. If only Lynch took the time out to just revise the script and give it the bump that it is crying out for, then I am sure we would all be watching it over and over again. It had all the ingredients but the Lynch cake just didn't bake this time.give it the bump that it is crying out for, then I am sure we would all be watching it over and over again.

0316666343|5.0|A great book that makes your heart hope that heaven is what the author makes it.  It inspires your mind and opens your heart.
055321263X|5.0|After watching the Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's renditions of Wilkie Collin's classic crime thrillers, I went online and bought, &quot;Woman in White&quot; and the &quot;Moonstone.&quot;  (Interestingly, the books are slightly different and better than the films.)  As a result, Wilkie Collins is now rated amongst my favorite English classic authors like Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, and Charles Dickens.  Considered the &quot;father of the crime thriller,&quot; Wilkie set the pattern for which all mystery novels such as Sherlock Holmes were and are still being written.  I tried his &quot;Haunted Hotel&quot; once and was terribly dissappointed, so stick to his two best!  You'll find yourself intrigued by them and reaching for them to read over and over again for years to come.
0316666343|4.0|But not quite ugly. Like a few other reviewers, I believe this book was overrated, simply because of its \\"original\\" originality. Few novelists dare challenge the pigeonhole they are often faced with as fiction writers. For example, if you are a literary writer then readers will expect something deeply profound and annoyingly thought-provoking. If you are a commercial fiction writer then people want shoot'em up's and \\"whodoneit\\" type of storylines.<br /> That said, I am glad to see that Ms. Sebold  decided to ignore the stereotypes and be her own woman. Unfortunately, this came with some flaws that pertain mostly to the storyline.<br /> The novel started off great and ended almost great.However, it was the in between--where she rambled on about the lives of her characters a little too much--that slowed the pacing of the storyline. Though she used many clever passages and one liners(\\"There was too much blood in the earth\\") she failed to bring the much needed tension I was looking for between Susie and the rest of the characters. In other words, there were times when I felt as though I was reading a memoir. Some of the lengthy narration I felt could have been replaced by dialogue.<br /> Perhaps this next critique is more of a complaint rather than a flaw, but I expected more lively descriptions of heaven and a stronger interaction between Susie and Franny(a character who I feel wasn't fully developed). But this was obviously how Ms. Sebold wanted it written, therefore I will not call it a flaw.<br /> The reason why I give this book four stars is because the writing itself is well written and though flawed, the storyline did have an impact by the time I had finished reading the book.<br /> I do recommend this book to whoever wishes to experience a nearly masterful story that will leave you, if not satisfied with the storyline, then it will most certainly leave you questioning whether or not someone you lost to death is there with you, watching your every move. The Lovely Bones is worth reading at least once.y Bones is worth reading at least once.

B00005OATM|4.0|This is the famous production of the ring cycle that was first produced in the 1970's and booed of stage. The reason was that instead of it being set in around 400AD as intended by Wager it is played in 19th Century gear with Industrial age sets. The production was performed again in 1980 and filmed without an audience. This is the production that we see on this DVD. <br />The first thing which must be said is that the sound quality is excellent. The film production is also good and does not have the problem that some opera DVD's have of being transferred from VHS to DVD. <br />The general critical response to this version of the ring cycle has been posative with most of the barbs going to the singing of the role of Siegfried, something of no relevance to this DVD.<br />The fist DVD of this production I saw was that of Gotterdammerung which was a bit of a shock. Brunnhilde was played by someone far to old (although it was the first woman Siegried saw, he probably wasn't that choosy) and the chorus dressed in French working men's costumes was a shock. <br />However by this DVD somehow you forget it and if the opening scene is a large hydro dam instead of the Rhine and the Rhinemadens are dressed as prostitutes you don't seem to notice as much. the Gotterdammerung is a reasonably static opera. Probably as the first hour drags into the fourth you have a lot of time to look at people dressed as bank clerks and you have problems suspending disbelief. With this production, its all happeing with Gods and Giants striding the stage and people descending into the underworld the action keeps up. For that reason one forgets that Wotan is wearing a smoking jacket and that the trick about the Rhinemaidens was that they were maidens. <BR>Anyway this retailed where I come from cheaply and it was great value. The quality and timber of the orchestral playing is superb. The signing good and the, I suppose you call it acting okay.
0812550706|5.0|1) I'm reading a non-fiction book about training your children to become geniuses so the timing of this novel was uncanny. It really put a lot of things into perspective for me when it comes to making kids perform above their peers and what kind of skills they will need in order to continue to excel vs. survive...both of which are hard to seperate most of the time.<br />2) Fabulously engrossing story and characters<br />3) Non-stop tension and suspense from the first through the last chapters.<br />I didn't even try and figure out what was going to happen in the coming chapters and how things were going to work out because each page keeps you glued to the point that you loose yourself in what is occuring in the \\"now\\".<br />4) A book that entertains but REALLY makes you think when you stop long enougth to figure out what was just communicated. A book with a lot of depth.<br />5) Definitely in my all time top five novels!! I'm re-reading this again...probably sooner than later. :-)<br />I'm told to skip the rest of the series and head to Ender's Shadow...I did and that one isn't nearly as good as this one. This is still the best. A true classic.
0767802659|1.0|The movie focuses on gore and splatter in a total useless way. Unless other movies (i.e. Dead Alive), the limbs and other parts flying in this movie do not make you laugh, do not intice any form of humour, and will leave you totally puzzled as to why they chose this approach.<br />Another negative aspect of this movie is the blatant positive approach of fascism and neo-nazism. Maybe my particular likes and dislikes of humour did not allow me to see the scepticism and cynicism of the director, but as far as I'm concerned, this movie blatantly promotes the anihilation of a species and the militarization of the entire globe.<br />On the good side: the effects used in the movie were rather spectacular, so to some people this might be enough to give this movie a good rating.<br />I would actually encourage people to watch this movie, so they can make up their own mind whether movies should be used (or misused) for these kind of goals. I however feel no need to watch this piece of &quot;cinematograhic&quot; history ever again.
B000060MY6|4.0|I am constantly amazed when I hear people moan about films that are not simple to interpret. Whoever said that a film has to have a plot or make obvious sense. Film is art just like paintings or books and sometimes half the fun is discussing one's own interpretation with others. It's the exercise of finding support for your arguments that I and many others find stimulating. Don't get me wrong, I like your basic plot movies just as much as anyone else and appreciate zorbing out watching a movie for pure eye candy or entertainment value without having to think (Stars Wars or Collateral Damage come to mind.) However, it's refreshing in I guess a weird way, to get completely confused and mesmerized by a film that leaves you thinking for days. What also baffles me are those who complain about Lynch's movies yet still feel compelled to watch them. It's like they go through the process just to say, \\"I told you so. I couldn't understand a thing.\\" Harsh as it may sound, those persons may be better off sticking to formula Hollywood movies where things are predictable and completely spelled out for you.<BR>Are Lynch's films high art? Does he make them for film snobs? Hardly. This is a guy who I think is fascinated by the human condition and the onion skins that layer our societies. Just like any other director, sometimes his films flop (Dune) other times they deliver like Mulholland Drive. The imagery, characters, situations, script, and especially the acting, are all above par. I can't say enough about Naomi Watts. I couldn't be sure that Betty and Diane were the same actor until I watched it a second time. Really skilled actors have this uncanny ability of mind over matter, or in this case, mind over body and visage. What is Lynch trying to say? The hell if I know. Is he trying to make a statement? The hell if I know. Do I care? I don't think so. Did I enjoy the 2.5 hrs x 2 I spent watching it? Most definitely! For those who prefer your basic formula movies with clear theme,storyline, and message, rent the recent, \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" and stay away from this movie. You will not enjoy it. For those wanting to watch it just to see the lesbian scenes, you will be disappointed. All the scenes are done with minimal nudity and are far from being gratuitous. For those who enjoy ambiguity, rich imagery and symbolism, deep emotionalism, and yes, some shocking and disturbing scenarios, I think you'll enjoy this one.
0451169514|5.0|First of all, let me say that I'm not an avid reader of horror by any means.  Hopefully this review will be useful for people like me.  Frankly, I was surprised by IT.  I knew the book would be scary, but I wasn't prepared to be nearly as freaked out as I quickly became.  My extremely vivid imagination kept me on my toes for the entire novel.<br />I could go on writing about how this book scared the bejeezus out of me, but what really struck me about IT was the characters.  It's a truly beautiful story of a group of childhood friends and the evils they must face together.  The characters are lovingly built, and surprisingly endearing.  I'm really realizing that (for me at least) the best thing about (some) King novels is the element of friendship and solidarity--of standing together against a common enemy.  \\"The Stand\\" is another great novel that incorporates the same sorts of theme, although there it's the solidarity of humanity instead of a few friends.  Then, of course, there's always \\"Stand By Me\\", also about a group of childhood friends.<br />Anyway, IT is remarkable for its ability to scare you yet warm your heart at the same time.  May not be appropriate for your 12-year old nephew, as there's some pretty disturbing imagery and no small amount of sex.<br />By the way, stay away from the TV movie until you've read the book.  Not only is the former vastly inferior, but part of the beauty of reading the novel is not knowing (and consequently finding out) what IT is.
B0000057C5|5.0|This album is very very good. Yes many buy this album<BR>only for Du Hast, but I bought it because it was all<BR>wonderful. Spiel Mit Mir, Kuss Mich (Fellfrosch), and<BR>Eifersucht are the best songs on it.<BR>I have been a Rammstien fan for a short time, but I<BR>very proud of this album. The only reason for barely <BR>finding Rammstein is to blame on my parents!If you<BR>do not know any german or your german is a bit sloppy<BR>you will still enjoy this cd to the highest top.<BR>With Till's vocals and with Christoph's, Richard's<BR>, Paul's, Oliver's and Christian's instruments <BR>creates a wunderbar universum.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|As another reviwer has stated on this forum, if the producers of this movie wanted to make their own film about time travel,they were free to do so. But this movie is very, very loosely based on the H.G.Wells classic.<br />Now, we serious science fiction buffs are relatively intelligent creatures. We understand that the books spoke not just about amazing technical breakthroughs, but also that it was and still is a warning and a well-written social commentary. This is the part that Hollywood conveniently left out.The movie became a show of special effects and little more.<br />Some details are also rather questionable. Does anyone REALLY believe that 800,000 years from now anyone will still be speaking English? Anyone spoken Sumerian lately?.... those people lived just under 4,000 years ago... <br />The Uber-Morlock volunteers a concise course on the history of the post-cataclysm world to Guy Pearce (in perfect English, of course...) and tells him that when the subterreanan survivors tried to emerge from the darkness they could not...yet somehow the Morlocks hunt in daylight. Incosistent even for this simple movie. Other little things abound...<br />In general, though special effects are good,I was rather disappointed with this movie, and would not recommend it to anyone who has actually read the book.
1577311523|5.0|I found out how true Eckhart Tolle's words were through applying them.  I IMMEDIATELY found a deeper sense of peace.  As Eckhart stated in the book, at first you'll only be able to be fully present for a few minutes at a time, then you will learn to live predominantly in the present.  This has been my experience thus far, but I can honestly say that the few minutes that I am able to be in the Now are the most peaceful moments.  I can hardly put the feeling into words.  Buy the book, try it and you'll realize for yourself the power of living in the Now.

B000069HKH|5.0|This is one of the most powerful albums I have heard in a long time.  Bruce has taken the emotions, angst, and hope many of us felt in the aftermath of 9/11 and created one of his most brilliant albums ever.  I have been unable to remove this from my cd player.  <br />Its great to hear Bruce spread his wings musically, trying new sounds and ideas.   His lyrics continue to move me, particularly on 'your missing,'an absolute masterpiece of a song.  Sparse, spare, and immensely poignent. <br />My only gripe with the album is the song, &quot;Mary's Place&quot; which just makes no sense.  Its a great sound, but the words don't work.  &quot;I've got 7 pictures of buddha...so meet me down at Mary's Place, we'll have a party&quot; just doesn't make sense.  Bruce makes up for it with some of the other tracks, including &quot;Nothing Man&quot; a song that brings home how aspects of the world have changed, and some just don't realize that yet.<br />I strongly recommend this album to all.
B00005JKOI|4.0|So here's the long awaited &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot;, finally on DVD!  I really don't think I need to review the content of the movie- if you are reading this you have probably seen it!  I'm thrilled that Paramount has finally put this out on DVD.  But... and there is a BIG &quot;but&quot;....<br />There are no extra goodies on this DVD.  The original ending (Molly Ringwald ends up with Duckie) is not here.  (Check it out: Andrew McCarthy looks COMPLETELY different in the last seen. His hair is longer, his skin is whiter, and he looks about 10 years older, even though the ending was filmed only several months after the principle shooting ended!)  That is a total missed opportunity that legions of Molly Ringwald/Brat Pack/John Hughes/80's teen flick fans have been waiting to see for years!  There's not even a theatrical trailer on this DVD!  I can understand that deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer- these things can get lost in the vaults over the years. But you simply cannot tell me that they couldn't dig up the video for OMD's &quot;If You Leave&quot; to put on here!<br />Some commentary would have been great as well!  There are all sorts of things that the director could have discussed: OMD originally did a song for &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot; called &quot;Goddess Of Love&quot;.  When the ending of the movie changed, they recorded a new song (&quot;If You Leave&quot;)... &quot;Goddess Of Love&quot; ended up going on their &quot;Pacific Age&quot; album.  More trivia: Molly's favorite group at the time, The Rave-Up's, perform in the movie. (Their song wasn't on the soundtrack.)  Molly carries a notebook in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; that has &quot;The Rave-Up's&quot; handwritten across it.  <br />Watch out for an early performance by Gina Gershon!  She barely has any lines- I think she's in about two scenes.  You won't miss those lips of hers.  Also look for Dweezil Zappa (as &quot;Simon&quot;).  Annie Potts practically steals the show in this pre-&quot;DesigningWomen&quot; performance.  Not to be missed!<br />All in all... this is a great DVD. It's nice to see it letterboxed.  Paramount just missed a big opportunity by not going the extra mile by putting out something special for such a beloved 80's movie.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Do not miss out on your chance to aquire this CD.  Since hearing this album for the first time a mere nine months ago the Strokes have become my favourite band, knocking U2 from the top spot it held for 13 years.  There isn't a song on this album that doesn't cause shear excitement to bubble inside me.  Because of the brilliance of this music I've travelled thousands of miles just to see the Strokes perform live and they were amazing.  I love this band and their music so much it hurts!  A million times over buy this CD.
B00005ATQD|1.0|It's a good thing Kubrick isn't around anymore to waste celluloid like this. What's up with this guy? Does he have to be so artsy-fartsy as to think you don't have to have a plot, you can get away with obvious or misleading red-herrings and you can introduce characters willy-nilly without using them later or have a reason in the first place for having them there? Tom and Nicole did a fabulous job acting to a sub-standard script. Both quality actors, I felt embarrased for them that they fell for this dog. It seemed as if Kubrick wanted to make a porn movie but didn't have the guts.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is the third album I've just heard by Iron Maiden,the first being the compilation The best of The beast ,then Killers.<BR>I thought this was all right when I heard it couple of days <BR>back . But yesterday I realised it was a masterpiece . I heard it around five times in one day . <BR> Every song on the album is great .
0694003611|5.0|First time I read this to my son I thought it was a little weird, colored pages then black and white pages, etc. I guess that was educational for him though. I read this to him every night before he falls asleep. He now kisses the baby bunny night night and he is starting to put his finger to his mouth (mostly to my mouth) when I get to, \\"...the quiet old lady whispering hush\\". He likes the rhyming and the predictability. It is now ritual and a classic. I'd get it for a friend's baby!
B000002H97|5.0|I know that I have a Maximum of 1,000 words to write this review, but they're not needed!<br />GET THIS CD!<br />AS FAST AS YOU CAN!<br />GET IT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.........WOOOOOOOOOOOO
B00005B36H|1.0|you're probably wondering why i gave this album one star - frankly, i don't ever recall TOOL boring me until now. i picked up on Undertow in '94, and promptly purchased Ænima when it was released my first year in college (and scored Opiate later that year). Since 1996, i have seen TOOL live multiple times and listened to their records over and over and over again (i.e., it's safe to say i'm a long-time fan).<br />then, the news hit that the long-awaited Lateralus would be coming soon, and i was excited as could be for the arrival of the rock record that was going to blow me away all over again. unfortunately, that record never came.<br />i am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan - i own all of their releases - and have enough patience to sit through the 23min Echoes and the oft-ignored Animals record, but i lack enough patience to sit through the overrated complexity of Lateralus. It almost seems like the musicians took enough time to show how well they could play their instruments (danny, can you say SHOWBOATING???), but not enough time making sure the songs were well-written and thoughtful. granted, The Patient is a good song, and it was that song alone that prevented me from selling my copy of Lateralus, but if you want a good TOOL record that is more than banging-your-head-til-it-bleeds-because-it's-sooooo-hard music, get Ænima. This album is marred with a robotic technicality that manages to lose all the spirit, soul, and energy that should be on a Tool record made by human beings. there are only a few tolerable tracks, and the rest, even the longer tunes, are nothing but filler.<br />it sounds like Tool made a side-step, not a progression. this album is half of Ænima, with longer songs, less thought-provoking lyrics, and production so crisp and clear i feel like i drank a bottle of window cleaner. buy Ænima instead, as this one shows a complacency that i can get from blink 182 or some such nonsense...
0156907399|5.0|Wow...simply wow. Well, the first obvious thing to do is compare this to Ulysess. It is a 'day in the life of' subjectivist steam-of-consciousness novel, like Ulysess (though much, much easier to understand...more like Joyce in &quot;A Portriait&quot; really...), but it also has Proustian elements on the nature of time and man's place in time. It's a simple story, almost too simple. A family and some friends live on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides. That's about it. But, oh the Characters! Everylast one of them can be analyzed for hours and hours, yet none of them ever become less then believable. It's a wonderful, moving experience to read this novel. And for those of you worrying about the difficulty, don't. This isn't Finnegans Wake. Yes, you do have to pay more attention to it then say, a Daniel Steele novel, and it is by no means escapist, but it isn't anything that a slightly intelligent person couldn't figure out. And every slightly intelligent person should read this novel.
6305132984|5.0|It's amazing that a film made forty years ago still has such relevance.  It's ability to entertain and make the viewer think about racism and social issues is timeless. Rita Moreno steals the show as Anita with her unsurpassed dancing and acting skills showcased beautifully.  All the players are magnificent and this film changed forever the way we see the movie musical. As far as beautiful men go, these stunning actors in their skintight denims and trousers make us wish the current baggy pants trend would go away.  Far away. ...
0671042858|5.0|Not your typically Stephen King.  The story is about a little girl who gets lost in the forest and her love for a baseball player name Tom Gordon helps keep her going.  You feel for the child every inch of the way. You feel her pain and fear. Stephen King has really out done himself.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I have read most of the comments and find some of them quite hard to believe,  most people keep comparing the British version with the US version,why?  The British version was ground breaking television when it was shown on Channel 4, a channel that you do not need cable or a satalite dish to watch by the way.  The characters are believable and believe me they exist, I live in the city where it was filmed and you can see them any night of the week along Canal Street.  Stuart is a revelation, one minute you hate him for something that he has either done or said then the next you love him because he has redeemed himself, but his US counterpart Brian just doesn't have the same edge about him.  I am currently watching the US version which I find really enjoyable but it is just not as sharp as the UK version, yes the guys are better looking and can I say that Michael is a cutie but give me the British version anytime, anyone buying this version will not be disappointed it shows gay life in Manchester as it is, raw, funny and true to life!
B000002GOZ|4.0|Many people dismissed Bryan Adams in the mid-1980s as a fist-pumping Springsteen clone, and this was a highly unfair assesment of both men's work. Hearing Adams slow down \\"Fits Ya Good,\\" from 1981's You Want It, You Got It, made me listen to that CD again with renewed appreciation.  And the versions of \\"I Think About You,\\" \\"18 'Till I Die\\" and (Especially!) \\"I'll Always Be Right Here\\" absolutely outdo the originals! One of the best MTV live performance available, and well worth the cost of admission!
B00003CWPL|1.0|Although I adore most of David Lynch's work,movies & TV (Twin Peaks).Eraserhead has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! If you like weird,annoying and something that makes no sense at all,mixed together,then this movie is for you. All through the movie you pretty much get,a guy sitting in a room with a baby screaming at the top of it's weird little lungs.This movie will totally creep-out most people,and those that it doesn't,might want to ask themselves,if they're one egg short of a dozen,and they are cracking-up. But,just in case you'd like to check it out,I won't tell you any more,except to say,that after watching this movie,I very much wanted to run from my house screaming MY lungs out.
0312265859|5.0|This book is a FAST READ.  It would have been faster, except for the protracted fits of uncontrollable laughter at the situations our girl Stephanie gets herself into.<br />This time out, poor Mable Markowitz, next-door neighbor of Stephanie's parents, has a granddaughter and great-granddaughter who are missing.  She turns to Stephanie for help in locating them.  Stephanie is up to her ears in bond jumpers, who are more successful in escaping from Stephanie than they are at crime.  But when Mable begins to cry, that's when Stephanie breaks down and agrees to try and locate them.  In the process, she encounters a psychotic businessman, a bomber bunny and a carload of tarantulas.  And that's not the half of it.<br />Stephanie's gloriously loony family are all on hand to add their two cents worth. Ranger is turning up the heat, while helping to keep Stephanie supplied with cars, cellular phones and advice.  And Joe Morelli pops up at the scenes of most of Stephanie's personal disasters to lend moral support and sardonic remarks in equal measure. <br />This book kept me chuckling, giggling and groaning deep into the night.  Evanovich just keeps getting better at telling Stephanie's story.  I hope she never stops.

B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth was born for the role of Mr. Darcy! Exceptionally well-acted, the perfect chemistry felt between him and Jennifer Ehle is more than entrancing! The dialogue is exquisitely delicious, and quite stirring. There has not been, and I dare say, will never be, a more moving and exhilirating adaptation of this heartfelt tale of the changes we make for love. I can watch it a thousand times more and never lose my enthusiasm for it! Bravo for Colin and Jennifer, and to A&amp;E (&amp; BBC) for outstanding work! It would not be an exaggeration to say that this version of Pride and Prejudice is THE best you will ever see!
0609610570|2.0|This was a quick read on a hot afternoon, full of anecdotes and war stories based on experience at GE and elsewhere.  Accountability, clear strategy and honest assessment and reward of people never go out of fashion.  For the reader wanting to know why any of this works, wanting to look at alternatives (which the authors don't acknowledge) or interested in the pitfalls and how to avoid them, look elsewhere.
B000069I1H|1.0|If you haven't seen a movie in the last 20 years, then some of the comedy may seem fresh. Otherwise, you will find this a boring rehash of dumb jokes.
0316666343|5.0|I enjoyed this book because I liked the creativity of the writer...her imagination of heaven.  I liked how the family was followed throughout the years.  And I thought the ending was very satisfying.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly!
B00003CX7L|5.0|I liked this movie better than the first one.  The old gang is still here, with Buzz, Woody, Rex, Hamm, Sliky, and Potato Head, but the new characters introduced in this film are what makes it so good.  Potato Head gains a spouse when Mrs. Potato Head arrives, along with her habit of making sure her husband has enough items in his &quot;pouch&quot;, including his shoes and &quot;angry eyes&quot;.  Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye form Woody's round up gang.  Woody meets these new toys after being kidnapped by Al, a toystore owner who wants to add Woody to his collection of rare toys.  Woody's pals find out that he's been kidnapped and set off on a mission to bring him back to Andy's bedroom.  They encounter some funny mishaps along the way, but in the end, everyone ends up safe and sound.<br />I have 2 young children ages 3 and 1 and they both adore this film.  I also enjoy watching it with them, and I always seem to get a laugh from it.  This is a good movie to watch as a family.  The kids and the adults will enjoy it.
0553378384|5.0|This is my all-time favorite astrology book about my favorite piece of the chart: the Moon's Nodes, which have to do with karma and past lives, and indicate your most karmically appropriate direction in this lifetime. This book is enlightening on many levels and gives you a unique perspective on your soul's pattern that really helps everything make sense.<br />Best of all, you don't even need to know how to read charts to understand this book. All the North Node placements are in a table in the front of the book. And if you do read charts, you can look up the Node's house placement by house as well as by sign, for more information. This gives you an idea of the soul's direction in the chart, and which energies benefit the person on this level.
0345440757|5.0|I thought my daughter had colic until I learned E.A.S.Y. I purchased the book when she was 6 weeks old and by 7 week's no &quot;colic&quot; or so I though it was. It just turned out I needed to understand and respect my baby (and myself) and put us both on a schedule. Once I learned E.A.S.Y and S.L.O.W. my baby and I where both comfortable. Tracy puts it into a simple, no nonsense, like it is parenting how to. I threw away all the other books, you know the &quot;what your child should do and when&quot; books, and the &quot;performance anxiety&quot; that goes with it, thank God! I actually had people tell me that they couldn't believe how I knew what my baby needed and when. But a schedule works, what ever it is. And understanding your baby's type and accepting her makes all the difference, it helps that she was an angel-textbook type. It turns out she is a happy and flourishing little person. <BR>Baby whisperer for toddlers a must follow up read.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I just bought this CD today, and was very glad that I didn't waste my money. All the songs are pretty much AWESOME...I also liked the songs that weren't on english (I am not sure what she was singing, but it sounded GREAT). The song that made me buy this CD was \\"Objection (Tango)\\"--that song simply ROCKS! If you liked any of her songs on radio, then you'll LOVE this CD--there are even some better songs...but my favorite is \\"Objection (Tango)\\" In conclusion, \\"Laundry Service\\" is a must-have.
B000002H33|1.0|I can't stress how bad this band is. Particularly their drummer and singer. They think they are like the best at what they do when they really ... James Hetfield's style of singing is annoying, talentless, and shows his cocky attitude. And he acts like he's like a heavy metal god when the band isn't even heavy....or metal. One interview in a magazine will show this. Same with Lars, the drummer. He's not good at all. Kirk is a good guitarist but not good enough to be compared to the likes of Dimebag Darrell, or any other great guitar legend. This band may have been better back when this album was released but it's still Metallica and it still sucks. And to think that they are compared to the likes of Pantera or Slayer! This is music for those metal wannabe's who think they're cool because they ride a Harley and don't take showers.
0393317552|5.0|This will be a defining work. It is a superb answer to the &quot;why&quot; of history.  I enjoyed the book very much and continue to recommend it to friends and other readers.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of my favorite Pantera releases. Musically, this one is probably the most intelligent. \\"Mouth For War\\" is such a great song. \\"A New Level\\", \\"Walk\\", and \\"F*cking Hostile\\" are all great songs as well. There are two things that have been constantly said on here that aren't true. First off, Metallica does not surpass this band by any means because Metallica sucks and they are not heavy (nor are they metal). They're a bunch of cocky metal wannabe's who think they're so good at what they do when James Hetfield is a horrible, HORRIBLE singer and Lars is not very good at drums. This band made metal become actually heavy. Pantera is so much better sounding and more talented. Dimebag makes much better riffs than Kirk ever will, there isn't much of anything that Phil CAN'T do with his voice, Vinnie's drumming is mindblowing, and Rex is a better bassist although I don't have a problem with Jason. Especially since he left the band. Good move. But back to the album, this is the perfect first album to get if you're just getting into them. All 11 songs are excellent. Don't pass it up!
B0000029DD|5.0|This is my review of 'Grace' by Jeff Buckley. My personal opion is that Jeff Buckley was one of the most talented artists to ever come out of alternative pop. The way he sang and the notes he could hit, were stellar, and he was just starting. He was a new artist and this was his first and only original album that he released in his short lifetime. He could have become a superstar, if only he had lived on. We would still be talking about Jeff Buckley, and hail him on his new brilliant album, but sadly we can only judge, I mean praise this tiumph of an album such as 'Grace'. The album has a pop field to it, but it also has a jazz-like atmosphere. And the way the man could sing and the way he could write songs, and arrange songs; and even the songs he didn't write in this record he made them his own.If I can use the term 'Hautingly Beautiful' to describe this record I will. After listening to the record only once, you have a sense that he can go on to bigger and better things. After you listen to the record a few times you fall in love with it, and after you have listened to it 100 times, it becomes apart of you. And I have to give two BIG thumbs up to the song 'Hallelujah' the first time I heard it, i almost cried. It is arguably the most beautiful song in the history of recorded music. His voice on that song will take your breathe away like it did me. On final thought buy this record, listen to it, take in the words and keep it and share it to as many people you possibly can.
B000002UAU|5.0|When thinking of music I really dig, I always wind back with Beatles tunes as part of my list. So do you. That's why you are reading my review. Maybe we can bicker about the finer points of Beatlology, but we both dig the Fab Four's music as a whole.<br /><br />You probably like the Beatles, but don't know which album to get. That's what you hope the reviews will do for you. You've compared prices elsewhere, and see this is the place to buy it. Which CD?<br /><br />There's \\"The Beatles 1\\" CD, the one with the #1 hits. A good value for a lot of songs. No bad, but, for the Beatles and a few other bands, getting the original album is a better choice. The songs are best heard in context, in an odd way, like a Pink Floyd album. Besides, on \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" the songs are all incredible. A bit funky, but intensely enjoyable. A compilation won't meet the need.<br /><br />I can't debate which album is the best one to buy. Too messy of a conversation. That's like arguing whether John or Paul wrote better songs. It gets you nowhere, and what you need is a Beatles album.<br /><br />Why \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"? There are 13 good reasons. The first is the title song, and the last is \\"Day in the Life.\\" The 11 songs in between are equally classic. You know them already.<br /><br />I could emote of the wonders of each song. Today, \\"Lovely Rita\\" is my favorite on \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" but tomorrow \\"When I'm 64\\" might be the one. Depends on the moment. But each song is completely different than the previous, meriting much value for this album.<br /><br />And I haven't the room to get into it, but the pop-art of the album (take a close look at it) is fascinating. Big controversy back in its day about the cast of characters who are featured. Can you name them all?<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B000069HKH|5.0|How do you find new words to describe the talent that is Bruce Springsteen?  First let me say that this work ranks among his very best, despite a tendancy to assume greatness cannot follow so long after someone's assumed &quot;prime&quot;.  I find that during these later stages of his career, Bruce has just as much to say while his musical abilities have improved.  These songs are just fantastic, well-crafted, joyous, touching, haunting, fun.  The band is amazing, better like fine wine.  This is the first CD I've purchased in a long time where I've played it through over and over for 3 weeks without removing it from my player.  Just a great event in the career of the most important figure in pop/rock music since 1970.
B000002JPA|5.0|If there is one album that would get anyone into Dreamtheater, Images and Words is it.  With the addition of James Labrie as thier singer, Dreamtheater achieves a sound so resounding and unique, it makes their mediocre debut album seem like it was written by a different band entirely.  <br />Every track in Images and Words is strong.  This is Rock and Roll with heart, folks.  Being a progressive rock band, one can hear the influences of older progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, and even Kansas at times.  Even with these influences in their music, Dreamtheater has created a style of music (starting with this album) that is uniquely their own, and can take a while to get used to. Their songs are longer than many usual rock songs, and the arrangements are completely different.  Their use of keyboard in their music is just as prevalent and important as their use of the guitar. Don't let this deter you, though, the music is wonderful and wholly original.  Pull me under and surrounded are the two songs that got me hooked to Dreamtheater, and with patience I fell in love with the rest of the album.  <br />It is interesting to note that this album released during the height of the grunge craze (1992) has survived the time and is so highly regarded as one of the best modern Progressive Rock albums... (If not the best)  If you are looking for a different flavor of rock, look no further than DreamTheater.  Images and Words is definitely the first album from the band that you should check out, and if you give it a chance, you'll be in for a wonderful and original treat.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This movie goes a little different from what you usually see in Disney. First, it has a great economy of characters, basically the entire plot is supported by 2 heroes and 2 villains -proof that a good story doesn't need a novel-like cast. Then, it's much lighter than many others. Remember how dramatic \\"Tarzan\\" was? Or \\"The Lion King\\"? Nothing like that: this one is sheer comedy, strictly to laugh, and that doesn't mean it's less artistic: cartoons are allowed to be simply funny. Artistic it is: I can tell you, I've been myself to Peru to study Inca world quite closely, I can see they took their time to research what they were going to draw here. The drawing line is also lighter than other movies, much in the Aladdin style, far from Poccahontas, where you can see the difficulty of the design, still the animation is as good and sophisticated as ever. As for the characters it's the typical Disney style: there's the lovable guy (in this case, sidekick Pacha), the modern \\"groovy\\" guy is the star, Emperor Kuzco, (in the smart-guy style of Aladdin's Genie, or the Lion King's Timon, or Mulan's Mushu) and the villain team made of the Evil One, that can be calm like Jaffar or hysterical like Cruella, in this movie, Yzma, the criminal master mind leans to the second choice, and her right-hand man, the silly, stupid guy, Kronk, that continues a tradition going as far as Pinocchio's team, the fox and the cat. About the plot, it's quite different from what we usually see in a Disney feature, much lighter too and very simple, but interesting enough to keep your attention to the end: the young ruler is a selfish brat and his evil assistant wants him out of the way, but in trying to kill him she accidentally turns him into a llama and he must overcome his spoilt obnoxious self to get out of his tragic situation, learning in the proces how to be a more likable person. For those that say this film is out of the usual Disney style I'll point out a few things: as always, they took a careful research for the environment presented (if this is not Inca world I don't know what it is!), the star is still cute and funny (even as a brat you have to like him) and he'll be the good one at the end. The humor can be striking at times and very refined others, just enough to keep you smiling, but all along! In this movie, we go back to old classic cartoon jokes that seem a little odd in a long feature, but work well for being so unexpected. And there are only as many songs as needed, (nothing can be more annoying than a song out of place that only seems to intrerrupt the story instead of working with it). And still it is very different from what we've seen so far. The story is not a love plot, the star doesn't pursue life-longed dreams and he's not Mr. Nicest Guy In The World. This is the story of a naughty conceited boy turned into a good person (in fact, what the original story of Pinnochio or Aladdin are really about, but Disney didn't use in the movie version) And, of course, there is a moral at the end: be good and you'll win -the typical Disney message. In it's roughness and apparent simplicity, \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is a real gem! The proof that a movie doesn't need to be overdone, that a Disney cartoon doesn't have to be a superproduction to be a masterpiece. It's as simple as a Pluto short film, and yet as exquisetely worked out as Aladdin. A great combination! And to laugh your head off!
B000002JKA|5.0|Awake is considered by many Dreamtheater fans to be their second best, outdone by only Images and Words.  While I do not agree with this statement, (I believe Scenes from a memory is their second best)  Awake is still a fine album and a must own for anyone who caught the Dreamtheater bug.  <br />This album is the third and last one with their original keyboardist, Kevin Moore.  Kevin was very instrumental in the quality of Images &amp; Words and Awake, as the quality of the keyboards in their songs are not merely background noise, they are instrumental for the quality of the music.  Their second keyboardist really lowered the quality of Dreamtheater's music. (See Falling to Infinity review)  <br />Awake, however, is filled with very good tracks and rousing rock songs.  Lie is definitely adrenaline pumping, and the Erotomania-Voices-Silent Man trio demonstrates DreamTheater's unique orchestration &amp; songwriting abilities.  Awake is filled with many other good tracks as well, 6:00 opens the album with a rousing bang and Caught in a Web is a great one as well.  Their unique songwriting ability in Images &amp; Words is evident here again, as Awake is a must own for Dreamtheater fans.
B00005QXDD|4.0|It's a great CD with awesome music and funny bits. However, most of the CD is just sound bits and not music. One of the better CDs out there, but don't expect 60 minutes of music.
B000001IPP|5.0|This is the best album by Rancid. Period.  No questions asked.  My first CD by Rancid was ...Wolves, but after buying this one, and listening to the whole thing, this is by far better.  There is a lack of some ska but that's okay.  Every song is good.  There isn't one that I don't like.  And if the lyrics aren't good, the guitar riffs and Matt on bass makes up for it.  Midnight probably has the best guitar in the whole CD.  The best songs are Nihilism, Radio, sidekick, salvation, tenderloin, let's go, jimmy and johnny, black and blue, st.mary, and midnight. Buy it.  it is well worth the money.  and if you are not punk, buy it. you'll enjoy it and be open to a whole new world of music.  and if you listen to blink 182 or New Found Glory don't buy it.
0790729725|5.0|I've seen many Gangster/mafia flicks and none of them even came close to comparing to this work of art. It's a classic, it's a downright masterpeice! Everything about this movie was just amazing. If your into Mafia movies put this movie infront of all of the others. Amazing screenplay followed by some amazing actors who single handly played a wonderful preformance. I'm surprised this movie didn't win all of the academy awards. This is defiently one of the top ten best movies of all time. Own it today!
B00005B36H|5.0|Its a different sort of Tool album, not what you'd expect, not quite. I has an overall softer feel and is a bit more melodic than Opiate, nima, or Undertow. Someone accused Tool of selling-out with this album, but thats not at all true. Its not my favorite Tool album, but, like all Tool, there isn't a bad track on the cd.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out two years ago and I still absolutely love it.  For me, it was a fresh, new style and a change from all the other female artists on the scene.  Here was a girl (sorry...woman) who's strong and not afraid to stand up for herself, and OH MY GOD she has pink hair.  But this CD is full of hits that weren't recognized by the public and an honesty unparallelled by anyone - and all this on a debut album!!!  The songs are catchy and her voice is different, but different sometimes just means unique, which makes her songs all the more beautiful.  Here's a quick review of the CD:<br />1. Split Personality: I will never EVER get tired of this song.  It has heart, it has rythym, it's catchy, and it is HOT! - 10<br />2. Hell Wit Ya: This is my fave song on the album.  Pink shows you who's in control with the fast beat and hard lyrics. - 10<br />3. Most Girls: This song rocks also, as I'm sure you all know.  Pink is NOT most girls. So it was overplayed, who cares. - 9.5<br />4. There You Go: The first single off this album and the second I heard it I knew it rocked my world.  Not exactly your classic-style break-up (love the motorcycle though) - 10<br />5. You Make Me Sick: Another hit single from a hit album.  Pink's a little daring with her lyrics as well - 9.5<br />6. Let Me Let You Know: This is least inspiring on the album.  It's slower, and wasn't really pulled off to Pink's advantage if you ask me - 7<br />7. Love Is Such A Crazy Thing: Another slow one, a little disappointing as well but I guess it could catch on - 7.5<br />8. Private Show: The story of guys put into song form, and I have zero complaints.  Nice groove - 9<br />9. Can't Take Me Home: The title track, and rightfully so.  It displays Pink's will to express yourself in this in-your-face beater song. - 9.5<br />10. Stop Falling: This \\"ballad\\" (I hate that word) was pulled off absolutely beautifully, as Pink bares her soul and allows you to understand her a little better.- 9.5<br />11. Do What U Do: A great fast track but I think it's lacking a little something of the depth expressed in the rest of the album - 8<br />12. Hiccup: Also a fun song, you couldn't have thought it'd be serious with a name like \\"Hiccup\\".  Good rhythm (sp?) - 8.5<br />13. Is It Love: Another great song, though not on a typical Pink topic.  The lyrics are cute but painfully honest at the same time.  Great way to end - 9<br />As you could probably guess, I strongly recommend this CD.  If you're looking for a little hip-hop influence to take off the edge, you might also like Pink's latest, Missundaztood (another killer album).  But I can't say which one is better, they're both so different and everything is riding on personal taste.  Anyhow, if you know what's good for you, you shouldn't wait much longer before you buy this CD and get some Pink in your life.  THIS CD ROCKS!!!<br />PS.  My favourite colour is red.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is probably the biggest female artist in the UK at the moment. With a sell-out European Tour, multi-million selling anthemic No.1 smash (Can't Get You Out Of My Head) and a critically acclaimed, No.1 multi-million selling album in the form of Fever, Kylie Minogue has more than one reason to be smiling all the time. Her music and writing is the best it has ever been and this has all payed off. There's something about Kylie Mingoue that appeals to everyone. She's like how Britney Spears was a couple of years ago; loved by everyone in one way or another. Since Can't Get You Out Of My Head, she has gone on to became an international superstar breaking the States with Fever and a fanbase that is growing by the day in Europe...<br />Fever begins with More More More (10/10). This is a brilliant way to start the album. The funky, melodic beats are supplied with silky and smooth vocals from the pint-sized pop idol. Upon hearing Fever for the first time (December 25th 2001), this was my immediate favourite. Love At First Sight (10/10) is Track 2. Released as a single on Monday 10th June 2002, it peaked at No.2 in the UK chart - held off No.1 by that slack Elvis tune. The video for this song is just pure class (see my review for the single for more). Track 3 is Can't Get You Out Of My Head (10/10). Do I even have to review this song? OK, here's the facts: No.1 in the UK for 4 weeks, 1,250,000 copies sold in the UK alone, the biggest selling single in Europe of 2001, the 3rd biggest selling single of 2001 in the UK, No.1 on MTV Amercia's TRL for weeks, Madonna admitted her son Rocco became \\"obsessed\\" with the song, it broke British airplay records by being played 3,062 times in one week, the skimpy white dress in the video was voted the most desirable outfit of the year, the funky groovy dance in the video sets off a nationwide dance craze, voted one of the greatest videos of all time in a poll by VH1, voted the 3rd greatest No.1 single in the UK of all time behind Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and John Lennon's Imagine. Can't Get You Out Of My Head is not just a great pop song, it is a legendary, classic anthem. 'Nuff said! Track 4 is Fever (9/10). The album's title track is a fantastic song. Not very up-tempo, more mid-tempo it is accompanied with a raunchy Doctors and Nurses performance at her concerts. Give It To Me (10/10) is the shortest track on the album. Not even three minutes long, it manages to cram in all the great ingredients needed for a fantastic pop anthem!<br />Fragile (9/10) is Track 6 and is the slowest song on the album. It's the slowest, yet it's not even slow! This mid-tempo slushy ballad shows Kylie's mushy side, not often seen in many of her other songs. Come Into My World (10/10) is Track 7 and is due for an October 2002 release. It will also be backed with a Double A-Side single written by Madonna that isn't featured on Fever. Unfortunately, it will be the last single to be taken from Fever! Oh well! Track 8 is In Your Eyes (10/10) and was the second single to be released from Fever on February 18th 2002 peaking at No.3 in the UK chart - behind Enrique Iglasias' Hero and Westlife's World Of Our Own. Not the best song on the album, but still funky and very catchy. Well, it is Kylie! Dancefloor (10/10) is Track 9. This very camp and very brilliant song is perfect single material, but that will never be. Love Affair (10/10) is Track 10 and one of the absolute stand-out tracks on Fever. The hard, funky bassline is very summery and would be perfect to be listen to in Ibiza. Track 11 is Your Love (9/10) and is very Spanishy. The Spanish guitar at the very beginning sounds like Please Stay from Light Years. I wasn't too sure on this song at first, but it has grown on me a lot since I got the album. Burning Up (10/10) is Track 12, the final song on Fever. This incredibly catchy dance song is very repetative, but very addictive! All Kylie seems to sing is, \\"I'm burning up baby, I'm burning up\\" throughout the whole song!<br />Still, Kylie is a force to be reckoned with despite her minature frame. Fever proves exactly why Kylie is here to stay. As long as she keep producing songs of this quality, she will be around for a very long time in the future. So for all you people who think she's a talentless waste of space, you're in for the long haul because this foxy little lady's gonna be here for longer than you'd like to think. Anyone who hasn't got Fever should take a look at its worldwide sales and think of the three singles that have already been released from it. I think you'll find that this is an album that your CD collection is craving! Buy it now from Amazon!ole song!<br />Still, Kylie is a force to be reckoned with despite her minature frame.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Admittedly, I am a fan of Pixar's work. Their artists have done some incredible animated features over the years. Between the \\"Toy Story\\" movies and \\"A Bug's Life,\\" they have managed in a short time to build an impressive track record. Their shorts are also among the best ever produced. So my expectations going into this movie were very high.<br />The story concerns the monsters in your closet. The theory being that their world runs of the energy produced by children's screams. Sulley (John Goodman) is number one at getting screams. His main rival (Steve Buschemi) will do anything to gain the top spot. Oh, and they consider the touch of a human child to be toxic.<br />While not as instantly relatable as \\"Toy Story,\\" the movie builds on the talents of Goodman and Billy Crystal (Mike) to bring you into this make-believe world as Sulley and Mike try to get little Boo back through the closet door to the safety of her bedroom.<br />Disney/Pixar has presented this well on DVD. Both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions are available on the first disc. The second disc has games, outtakes, an award winning animated short, and a fun (easy to find) Easter Egg.<br />All in all, if you enjoy Pixar's work, or animated features in general, this is a must have for your collection.
B000000OQF|1.0|I agree with 'use yor brains part 1'(previus reviewer). There is nothing about this album that has an original thought tied to it. Very predictable record. Axl went to the same vocal coach that every other wanna be heavy metal singer went to in the 80's. The man simply can't sing. These guys spent to much time  idolizing Keith Richards off stage persona and not enough time paying attention to his playing. All these 80's glam bands did this. They wanted to be rock stars before they learned how to play. It wasn't about music, it was about being famous. Only real talent has staying power. These guys barely got through a second album. They are now listed in the 'Where are they now?' category........the funny thing is though..........nobody is even asking.
B00002MZ12|5.0|I'd go further than that - This CD is better the Bhagavad-Gita and athlete's foot rolled into one. A festive outing, to be sure - all captured in pristine digital audio and reproduced in the manifold on shiny round plastic things that you will want to buy. I played this CD for my grandmother, and do you know what? SHE'S NOT MY GRANDMOTHER ANY MORE!!!
6302256615|4.0|Point Break sports a line-up of 90s stars like Keanu Reaves &amp; Patrick Swayze. Johnny Utah (Keanu) is an FBI agent transferred to Los Angeles where the sunshine, surf and music take his fancy. Special Agent Utah goes undercover among the surfers of the Californian south coast to investigate a near perfect string of bank robberies. There he meets his dark alter ego called Bodhi (Swayze), who becomes a dangerous teacher to him. However, Johnny is quick on the uptake: he stalks his prey ever mindful of Bodhi's most important lesson: If you want the ultimate thrill, you must be prepared to pay the ultimate price. Quite an entertaining movie although it is filled with all those familiar cliches of the teen movie genre, the most amusing being Keanu surfing in the stormy waves and yelling it out: \\"I am Johnny Yooootaw ...!
B00000J7RZ|4.0|As we all know Jennifer Lopez is not the greatest singer in the world but she does put out some great pop music. ON THE 6 is a good example of that. With smash hits like \\"if you had my love\\" and \\"waiting for tonight\\", ON THE 6 is a great debut. Besides the smash singles, songs like \\"should've never\\", \\"no me ames\\", \\"promise me you'll try\\" and \\"talk about us\\" are great ballads. Even though Jennifer's range was limited it turned out well. Overall I enjoyed ON THE 6. It's a great mix of ballads, hot dance numbers, and R&amp;B/latin influences. At first I thought that Jennifer wouldn't go far with her singing career but ON THE 6 proves that she's got what it takes.
0792843835|5.0|Bagdad Caf&eacute; gathered top awards at the Rio Festival in 1988 and they were well deserved. Magic, warmth and charm are brought to a little hotel out in the middle of nowhere by a somewhat bulky Bavarian housewife. Despite her size, her femininity comes through in her slippers: delicate, soft and sensual, they symbolize her womanhood and help make those around her fall in love with her. She even inspires an artist to paint her in the style of Botticelli. Large, voluptuous people can rest assured that size need not detract from their deep spiritual essence. Watching this sensitive, human movie is a most rewarding experience.
B000068QY7|4.0|Most Oasis fans today were drawn into the band after they heard songs such as Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova.  Those who are back looking for more of the same will be very disappointed.  This is not the same band which rocked the airwaves back in the mid 90's.  Oasis is a completely, and utterly new band; that's what two new members will do to you.  Having said that, Heathen Chemistry is not a bad album by any means, but I must say that I was mildly disappointed after hearing it -- I guess I was expecting a lot more.<BR>1. Hindu Times - opens the album quite well, loud rocker, good lyrics, very catchy<BR>2. Force of Nature - a song I heard before from the Love, Honour, and Obey soundtrack, it's a decent song, Noel bashes his former sweetie Meg Matthews, rousing chorus<BR>3. Hung In a Bad Place - Gem's contribution, moves fast, rocks hard, one of the better tracks on the album<BR>4. Stop Crying Your Heart Out - the song everyone has been talking about, and it is a good one, melodic, haunting Liam vocals, tugs at your soul in every way<BR>5. Songbird - ehhh, it's ok I guess, I'm never a big a fan of acoustics, doesn't seem to have very good studio production either<BR>6. Little By Little - THE best song on the album, hands down, Noel's finest vocals since The Masterplan, surefire No. 1 single<BR>7. A Quick Peep - Andy Bell's instrumental, not too bad, seems like a filler, why does such a short album need a filler? <BR>8. (Probably) All In the Mind - most underrated song on the CD, I don't get what the problem is, this one sounds more like classic Oasis than any other, gets the album started again nicely<BR>9. She Is Love - Noel's acoustic, again I'm not a fan of acoustics, and innane clapping, it's an ok song anyway<BR>10. Born On A Different Cloud - everyone seems to like this one, I am truly indifferent to it, it's sluggish, hard on the ears, muddled by poor studio production, Liam's vocals and lyrics are top notch, surprisingly<BR>11. Better Man - ends the album with a bang, fast moving, catchy tune, BUT, is haunted by poor production once again.<br />After listening to Heathen Chemistry, my perception of Oasis isn't any different as they are still one of my favorite bands.  I felt poor studio remastering and digitizing hurt the album immensely.  Morning Glory was their best produced album, and all the other ones, for whatever reason, were cheated out of excellent studio production.  Overall, a good album, and worth all 40+ minutes of listen.  Buy it.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I generally don't read books like this for a message but, this book gave me peace.  I read the last chapter 5 times, it really touched my heart.<BR>I have recommended it to several of my friends who were also touched by it.  Can't wait for the movie!

B000069CWE|4.0|When i heard that my favourite band were producing a remix album i was overly excited. OK so i thought that maybe now would be a good time to come out with a new album but i was willing to give it a chance. <BR>So, on the 29th July i hurried to my local HMV and purchased my copy of Reanimation and i have to say that i was surprised. But in a really really good way! The guys have done something that i don't think i've seen any other artists do; they produced a totally different sound to their original tracks. The only complaint i have with this cd is that My Decemeber is runined. The origial song is my favourite LP song ever and i could listen to it over and over and never get bored of it. <BR>But believe me, if you're a Linkin Park fan you will love this cd! The boys have done us proud!
B000069HKH|5.0|I've never been a huge, huge fan of The Boss, but I've listened to this CD over and over.  Nobody can sing about our collective pain surrounding 9/11 like he can.  And yet there is a feeling of hope to this CD, too, that keeps it from being a total downer.  He wrote from his heart and it shows.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol's first full length manages to incorporate the increadible beauty of their first EP and extend it longer into a true aural masterpiece for this year. Combining the drones and melancholy manners of early 80s synth-pop and a desperate calling from the early 90s, Interpol's CD is an earnest yet compelling work that doesn't just attack you as a sonic force but as an intellectual one, that hits you both lyrically and musically at the same time.<br />What makes the album really spectacular is the relative lack of crescendos and hook-laden choruses. The band stays together as a tight unit churning out music, not being compelled to shock the listener with intense moments and choruses but instead letting the minimalism of the work speak volumes. Songs like &quot;PDA&quot; and &quot;NYC&quot; don't journey on chord structures and stories, but explore minor changes in the music itself that change the entire feel of the song. It is in this minimalist  fashion that Interpol has made a CD that you just put on repeat and LISTEN, a situation where it doesn't matter if you listen actively or passively, but remains wholeheartedly enjoyable.
B000056V73|5.0|This film is good on many levels.  Overall, I think the film gives us the image of coming of age, reaching that understanding of who we are and where we want to go.<br />On one level, there are the three main characters who all must come to grips with the life they think they are living and the life they need to live.  The main character, William, is an uncool rock journalist.  He is younger than other kids in his grade at school, and probably too young to travel with the band.  He believes he is cool because that is how the band makes him feel.  After submitting his story, he begins to realize that what he thought about himself was not true.  His mentor helps him come to the realization.<br />Penny Lane, the Band Aide, must also grow as a person.  She has her idealized life, but doesn't understand her place and importance.  After finding out that she has been &quot;traded&quot; and having William attack her dream of a far-off land, she realizes that she must move on.<br />Russell, the guitarist, is trying to understand his place in the band as the leader and as a better musician.  He thinks that he will have what he wants with no repercussions.  He hurts Penny and thinks that he can correct this.  Her getting him with William shows him that he has responsibilities as a person and musician.<br />On the next level, the rock band, Stillwater, is the quintessential band coming at the end of a generation of musicians.  The life they want is no longer there; the scene of rock and roll is progressing, and they must learn to adapt.  The idealized notions they have will hit the wall once they hear of the article on them.  Afterwards, they must mature to continue.<br />This is a fine movie, and I would highly recommend seeing it.  It is witty and serious at the same time.
B00005JL3A|2.0|Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie.  And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares.  I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners.  Most of all, I kept wondering why Milla Jovovich, who is such a good actress, deliverd such a flat and emotionaless performance.
B00005AWMF|5.0|A world of shady international playboys who break women's hearts for sport (Smooth Operator). Of ambitious starletts who barter their innocence for a shot at fame (Jezebel). Of interracial romance (purportedly, The Sweetest Taboo). Above all, it's a world of love that spins to a silky smooth soundtrack of European jazz fused with urban soul. Love with its ecstasies (Your Love Is King, Paradise), heartbreak (Is It A Crime), and ironies (Never As Good As The First Time). Her songs are filled with tension between joy and sadness, romance and heartache. They are populated by real people with their suffering and redemption: the Somalian famine victim who lives only to feed her child (Pearls, her most powerful moment on record), the war veteran facing a tidal wave of post-traumatic memories (Like A Tattoo). She may be the queen of romance, but her world is far from romanticized. This is the stuff of real love and real life - good, bad, beautiful, and ugly - delivered from ground zero in a compassionate voice ...This is classy, literate, and intelligent soul, the standard by which the rest of soul music should be judged.

B000002J27|5.0|1976's \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" was the first Genesis album without lead singer Peter Gabriel, with drummer Phil Collins taking Gabriel's place at the mike on a full-time basis for the first time (Phil had already sung lead vocals on a pair of the band's earlier songs, \\"For Absent Friends\\" & \\"More Fool Me\\"). \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" was a landmark album for the band, and it still stands today as one of their best. It not only showed the music world that Genesis *could* survive without Gabriel, it also proved to those who thought of Genesis as \\"The Peter Gabriel Band\\" that Gabriel was not, in fact, the only talented musician in the group. While Peter is most certainly a musical genius, and he was a fantastic frontman & songwriter for Genesis, ALL of the band members, including Collins, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett, and former members including Anthony Phillips, etc., all contributed to the group's musical magic right along with Peter. \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" was the proof of that. Now a quartet, \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" finds Genesis still at the top of their game, with eight marvelous compositions that remain among the best in all of progressive rock, with such band staples as \\"Dance On A Volcano,\\" \\"Squonk\\" (both superb Genesis rockers), the lovely, majestic songs \\"Entangled,\\" \\"Mad Man Moon\\" & \\"Ripples,\\" the great fun of \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\" & the title song, and the mindblowing coda, \\"Los Endos\\" (a sort of instrumental re-cap of the album's previous songs, with the band bidding a fond farewell to Peter Gabriel at the very end, as Collins sings \\"There's an angel standing in the sun/Free to get back home\\"---it's a line from \\"Supper's Ready,\\" the band's magnum opus from 1972). The band's songwriting & musicianship here is truly sensational, with Banks, Collins, Hackett & Rutherford delivering some of their greatest work ever recorded. And Collins' voice perfectly fits the bill---if *any* singer could take over for Peter Gabriel, it was Phil. Thank God thatthe band didn't have to look very far for the man for the job! \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" is classic Genesis all the way, and one of the band's greatest accomplishments. Let the dance---and the Phil Collins era---begin!
6305313687|4.0|AMERICAN HISTORY X is a film that definitely makes you think. If you live in a city it makes wonder what motivates people to do what they do and how they could perform such acts of violence. If you live in rural America you wonder the same thing but are glad you don't have neighborhood rival gangs around your home. Directed by Tony Kaye - the only film I know he has done to date - there is a sense of satisfaction with the completely sad ending of this film.<br />Edward Norton does a phenomenal job as playing a kid, Derrick Vinyad growing up against all odds being thrown at him and going through the judicial system - and failing. Failing his family. After growing up in gangs and violence Edward's character goes to prison and threw several reform programs only to learn that his childhood was never a childhood. The help of Avery Brooks', Dr. Bob Sweeney, and the two travel a road down LA streets that would scare even the most indignant criminals.<br />The photography is cleverly don the best part about the film is the kid playing Edwards brother, played by Edward Furlong, gives an incredible performance right until the end. The ending is shocking and almost disgusting - but the emotional impact is very real.<br />There are not many DVD extra's on this one. There is no commentary which I would have liked to have heard from the director because apparently what I had heard is that he didn't like the studio cut of the film and filled a law suite to New Line in 1998 about not letting him use his pseudonym \\"Humpty Humpty\\" because he didn't like the final version of his film that New Line cut for him. Either way - this is a good film, but certainly not for kids under high school age - however, I think High School freshmen, should watch this for their own safety.

B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is an amazing artistic achievement  from its  vocals, to its musicianship, to its lyrics to its melodies. This CD rocks and seemingly springs from Springsteen's soul  -- and heart. You never EVER feel he did this to get a quick hit on the charts, or to attach his name to a compelling cause to look good. The lyrics  --  in some cases they could stand alone as poetry -- make it clear he's overwhelmed by the tragedy, incompressibility, brutality, and nobility of 9/11. So he uses his art to try to make some sense of it all. All of this CD's songs are fascinating and you'll want to hear them again and again. Many are home runs and there isn't a single dud here.<br />  Springsteen may be one of the few artists to be able to do a project like The Rising and sound like he means it. There is no pandering. Springsteen hasnt written songs urging people to go out and seek a quick-fix revenge, or hate anyone (even though 911s events certainly warrant that): his goal seems to be doing songs that help healing, coping and -- if  at all possible -- understanding the magnitude of a virtually incomprehensible tragedy and outrage. His zesty, gravely-voiced vocals sound super-glued to his beliefs and soul. You can sum of this CD in two words: quality...and HEART.<br />  My favorites included:<br />--The zesty, electrifying opening song Lonesome Day, which appears influenced by gospel.  The phrase Its alright...its alright...its alright is repeated and the song and then we hear Let Kingdom come/Im gonna find my way/Through this/Lonesome Day as the person singing the song realizes he took his lover for granted.<br />--Into the Fire (You gave your love/ to me and lay your young body down/Up the stairs, into the fire..)<br />--Waitin on a Sunny Day. A MELODY that could be a rock standard if it got sufficient radio play. As good as any optimistic, up-tempo rock song ever done with its great lyric and wonderful melody. My favorite song on this CD. I listen to this one several times before I listen to the others.<br />--Further on (Up The Road): Absolutely rousing. Youll listen to it over and over.<br />--Marys Place: At first glance a zesty party song...until you really listen to the lyric (listen to it and see for yourself). Song about coping with an optimistic sound.<br />--Youre Missing. The CDs most poignant song. (Pictures on the nightstand/TVs on in the den/Your house is waiting...For you to walk in...But youre missing...).  A true work of art.<br />--The Rising: The collections strongest song in terms of lyrics and music. Its about a firefighter, climbing the stairs to save others and unwittingly perish himself, sensing spirits above and behind me...May their precious blood blind me/Lord, as I stand before your fiery light...<br />  FOOTNOTE: Longtime Springsteen musician Steve Van Zandt is also on this CD, armed with a guitar and hitting his guitar, rather than with a gun in his popular acting role as one of Tony Sopranos boys on the Sopranos. The band sounds as good as ever.<br />  The Rising is a GREAT gift for anyone, because of its worthy subject, superb music and instant-classic lyrics. If Springsteen  never did nothing again, hed long be remembered for The Rising, which confirms his personal artistry -- and tastefully (and rhythmically) honors those who risked their lives, lost their lives, or lost loved ones on 911.CD.

6305546789|5.0|As you all know, Halloween was one of the first successful slasher films to set the standard for years to come. It's simply a classic, and is even better in this incredible DVD, which is packed with loads of special features.<br />In Haddonfield Illinois, Michael Myers, at the innocent age of 6 brutally murdered his sister on Halloween night. Why? Nobody knows (the reason is hinted in later sequels). He is admitted into a mental hospital and is treated by Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) for several years. 15 years later Michael manages to escape the facility and venture back to Haddonfield to kill off the rest of his family. The film mainly focuses on his sister Laurie who has been adopted by the Strode family. For days Michael stalks her until Halloween once again arrives, to relieve his rage again.<br />Halloween made it's debut in 1978, and for a film that old, you'd never know it with the picture and sound quality this DVD has to offer. It has been totally remastered.<br />The DVD is also loaded with special features including a 30 minute documentary on Halloween where you will be able to watch interviews with John Carpenter, Jaime Lee Curtis and alot more... some being surprises. Also you will find theatrical trailers, TV spots, photo gallery, and radio advertisements for the film. Very nifty.<br />Even if I owned this film on VHS I would still purchase the DVD for the amazing remastering, and the huge bundle of special features. This classic film has had a tremendous makeover.

0316666343|5.0|I'm a freshman in college.  This is one of the best books I've read in a while.  Refreshing prose. It's a book that kept me thinking about the themes far after I finished the book.  I didn't quite believe the body invasion scene, but otherwise a good read.<br />In answer to where is God in \\"The Lovely Bones\\", I liked that God was not addressed.  Although Suzie was in heaven, it was up to the reader to decide specifics as to those larger questions.  The \\"Where is God?\\" question was best unanswered to leave the focus on the impact of Suzie's death.  Besides, I was able to identify with Suzie much more than if the author had sat down and told me what the afterlife is like, detail for detail.<br />A \\"lovely\\" book.
B00006690G|5.0|This is arguably the best album in my posession. <BR>here's a little guide to each song:-<br />\\"White America\\" - Eminem has a lot to say about the so called \\"perfect states\\" and must try make both the good and lowly sides of America apparent. Listen hard to appreciate the true meaning.<br />\\"Business\\" - A truely comical beat and lyrical masterpiece. Eminem throws funny gags and soon sticks in your head. You could get your granny singing along in a few hours, very similar track to \\"Without Me\\".<br />\\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" - A touchingly epic tale of pre Eminem. This makes apparent all the chaos and sorrow that was going through the mind of Marshall Mathers through childhood, and how he has come to terms with it all now. <br />\\"Squre Dance\\" - A strange and twisted riddle, it's very difficult to seek the true meaning of this song. Have a go!<br />\\"Soldier\\" - The hard gangster side of Eminem. Basically he's saying he's a lot more than people make him out to be and this tough gangster style rap makes you feel un-settled with your walkman alone on the streets.<br />\\"Sayin' Goodbye To Hollywood\\" - What does Eminem think about leavin' Hollywood? listen well, vibe for a while and he'll tell ya! Quite a moving track!<br />\\"Drips\\" - Premiscous sex, drugs, alcohol and a lot of talk of sexually transmmitted diseases. Belongs on the same level as the \\"Drug Ballad\\" on the Marshall Mathers LP.<br />\\"Without Me\\" - The song everyone knows annd loves. Eminem see's himself justifying his music. He knows his music is crude and gives kids ideas. So now he's saying in a comical way that kids will listen to his music and even the superpowered rapper himself isn't gonna stop 'em. This is by far the best track on the album because it's so well known.<br />\\"Sing For The Moment\\" - The most touching and heartfelt of all eminems songs. a slow beat and excellent guitar by Joe Perry of Aerosmith. This track has emotion and a lot of Marshall's view on how he see's his fans.<br />\\"Superman\\" - Em'sthoughts on women and love. And typically he has to throw in some drugs. It wouldn't be the same without the hauntingly erotic voice of Dina Rae.<br />\\"Hailie's Song\\" - Proof that Eminem CAN sing. He sings this moving track for his daughter Hailie and cuts down a fraction on the swearing. A great dad!<br />\\"When The Music Stops\\" - D12 throw in a great appearance and help Eminem show what beeing in the spotlight is all about. A thumping beat and very fast lyrics on Eminems behalf. As usual Bizzare has a few disturbing ideas at the end.<br />\\"Say What You Say\\" - Eminems founder and homie Dr Dre. Eminem and Dre have everlasting souls. And they want the world to know that it will be impossible to forget them. A great tongue twisting chourus by Eminem.<br />\\"Till I Collapse\\" - Sounds remarkably like \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" by Queen. Fast paced and in your face. It hits you real hard, but you just cant get enough.<br />\\"My Dads Gone Crazy\\" - Eminem is joined by his cute daughter Hailie for the final part of this epic album. Lots of swearing and emotion towards Marsh's mom and Daughter.<br />If you decide to go town today. You will be stupid to walk past this CD. It's a must even if your not a profound Eminem Fan.
6305878323|5.0|I hadn't seen \\"Mary Poppins\\" since I was a teenager, but for years afterward I reviled the movie, specifically due to Dick Van Dyke's role.  I'd considered his portrayal of Bert to be unfocused, and his faux-Cockney accent went right up my back every time I heard it.  Recently, however, we purchased a DVD copy of the movie for our two-year-old, who insists upon watching it several times a week, thus forcing me to watch it as well.  And after dozens of repeat viewings, I can honestly state that my original assessment of the film and its actors was dead wrong.  \\"Mary Poppins\\" is absolutely brilliant, the kind of film (cliche coming) \\"they don't make anymore\\", a wonderful family film filled with heart, great animation, and wonderful songs.  It is rightly called Disney's crowning achievement.  And Dick Van Dyke is excellent, acting in his greatest film roles as Bert and Mr. Dawes.  A superb song-and-dance man with great comedic timing and a way of mugging for the camera without actually appearing to do so - if Van Dyke had lived in the era of the great MGM musicals of the '30s, we would probably be celebrating him today, and not Fred Astaire.  Most of the rest of the cast are outstanding as well.  Julie Andrews - well, what more can I say about her?  A well-deserved award.  David Tomlinson is equally is good as Mr. Banks - the look on his face after Bert's gentle admonishment, when his children show how much they love him by handing over the tuppence . . . that part always gets me.  The only character I have problems with is Glynis Johns - sometimes she looks as though she wishes she were in another movie, especially in some of her scenes with Tomlinson.  But overall, a great, classic film that has withstood the changes in tastes (when was the last time they made a musical?) and the test of time.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is war, this is what war is.<br />Buy this movie and watch it several times to cath the nuances and details the crew obviously sweated over.<br />Mel Gibson has elevated himself in this movie.

0380977788|5.0|My ten year old son read this first in one sitting (!), and I picked it up after he finished. I also read this all in an afternoon. While I think some of the reviews are a bit over the top, I heartily recommend this alternate world fantasy. I think it will especially appeal to the 10-13 year old age group, but adults who enjoy children's literature will also like it.<br />Coraline has moved into a new house, and her neglectful parents send her to count the doors in the house to be rid of her for a while. She knows that this is their plan, but she does it anyway. On the other side of the \\"extra\\" door, there is another world ... with perhaps nicer \\"other\\" parents. Of course there are complications, and this is where the novel takes off.<br />Neil Gaiman is an excellent fantasy novelist, and I would also recommend Neverwhere and American Gods (both are adult novels in reading level and American Gods has some adult content).
B00005YUPO|1.0|Not often is the cultural difference between Americans and the rest of the world this clear: This DVD is the silliest thing that I have ever seen - pictures of toys in motion, kids playing, other every day scenes - for crying out loud: Give your baby these toys and put on some classical music in the background, and you will achieve the same, plus he/she will learn some much needed motor skills as well. I was just so sad/disappointed when I played this for my baby, and I realized this was just using the TV as a babysitter and replacement for real learning activities. My advice, and an opinion I probably share with all of Europe, is to spend the money directly on some of good toys and music featured in this DVD
B00005JGAF|5.0|You absolutely need this if you are at all interested in punk rock. It is more poppy than their debut but better than Leave Home.

0792839730|3.0|Let me start by saying that I consider 3 stars a good movie, just not a very good or great movie.  This movie was directed by the fabulous Richard Attenborough and included almost every big star of the day.  But with so many stars, their individual charisma did not have the time to shine through, even with the three plus hours of screen time.  <br />The story is of operation Market Garden in World War II.  English General Montgomery's plan to invade germany in a week and smash their industrial capabilities to bring the war to a halt.  The plan was to take control of three bridges over the Rhine river and allow the Allied forces to progress foward.  <br />Unfortunately the plan had a lot stacked against it.  It involved troops and support twice the size of D-Day (which is not adequately depicted in the movie) to be dropped almost 400 miles behind enemy lines.  With not enough planes and too many men to drop at once.  In hindsight it was daring and courageous but seemed destined to fail.  At every turn things seemed to become more impossible.  And this only during the planning stages.  Things continued to go wrong during the actual mission.  <br />The movie seemed to lack that &quot;something&quot; that makes a great movie but I am not sure what specifically.  I would initially blame it on the era it was made but in retrospect the movie &quot;Midway&quot; was near the same time and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; pales in comparison.  But there are some standout scenes and performances.    <br />Nevertheless, this is a good war movie that shows what men must go through in battle.  The blind courage in following orders.  The stubborness of not accepting defeat.  Give it a look, you may like it more than I.  But even if you don't, you will still like it.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind is not a great movie, certainly not 2001's best film, but it's a respectable effort from director Ron Howard, and especially writer Akiva Goldsman, who was partially responsible for the travesty that was Batman and Robin. This biographical drama focuses on the life of John Nash, the genius who developed a radical concept on game theory. I'd rather not say further about the story, since there's a big plot twist halfway through that definitely puts a spin on much of the material that came before it.<br />As most have heard, A Beautiful Mind is largely inaccurate in its depiction of John Nash's life. Did I really care? Not particularly. I'd be a fool to expect a film based on facts to adhere entirely to the truth. Rather, I'm basing my opinion on how well-crafted the movie is, and how well it succeeded on what it was trying to be, that is, a film meant to inspire with its theme of love (and besides, I seriously doubt all the indiscretions of Nash's life would mesh well with that, so I'm wondering if the film's detractors really want to see all of Nash's odd behavior portrayed or if they're just looking for something to complain about). So how does this film come across as a feel good drama? Not bad.<br />First off, I'd like to mention that Ron Howard's direction and Goldsman's screenwriting are easily the film's weakest points, and not deserving of the Oscars they received. As has been evident in previous works, Howard is not a master of subtlety, and as best as he tries, he obviously doesn't have a firm grasp of what's genuinely good drama. A lot of the film's emotional moments are overdone and pure Hollywood; there's typical shouting, crying, and glass-breaking, nothing I haven't seen before.  While I have a lot to complain about Howard's direction, he's fine when it comes to pacing and style, and yes, the film itself does look very lovely and polished.<br />Definitely by far the film's weakest segment is in the last ten or so minutes, when we witness Nash age and receive his nobel prize. That alone doesn't sound so awful, but unfortunately, we get a speech that lamely hammers home the movie's message, that of how we must rely on emotion and love over cold intellect to solve our problems and survive in this world. It had already seemed obvious that was what the film had been striving to say throughout its rather lengthy running time, and I sure as hell didn't need Howard to blindly forcefeed the theme in such a manner.<br />Since I've done nothing but complain up to this point, you might wonder why it is I consider this film above average. The answer's simple. This all works thanks to Russell Crowe as John Nash and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, particularly the latter, who delivers a magnificent performance worthy of far more screen time (it's all the more disappointing to see that we never even find out what she does for a living, considering she was the one supporting Nash in his later, troubled years). Crowe is in very fine form in the lead, both sympathetic and likeable, though some of his tics seem more like obvious attempts at acting rather than genuine eccentric behavior.<br />Schizophrenia is a disease that's dealt with in the film. I've never studied up much on it, though on my paltry knowledge alone, I probably know far more than most Hollywood (most often, as in the case with Me, Myself, and Irene, filmmakers seem to think schizophrenia is just another term for multiple identity disorder). (moderate spoiler) I don't know how accurate A Beautiful Mind's portrayal of this mental illness is, but the Nash in the movie hardly seems like a true \\"loony,\\" and the film makes the disease seem a bit easier to handle than it probably is (Nash sees a few people who aren't there, and at one point, even reasons that they can't be there). Much like the rest of the film, the handling of this topic feels Hollywood, but also like the rest of the film, it's handled competently and in a fairly riveting fasion.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B00005KHJR|5.0|I came to this film somewhat reluctantly: being quite sensitive about treatment of religion, and the sort of person who steers well clear of things like 'The Life of Brian,' I did abandon it not far in, but came back. I'm glad I did.<br />It's immediate appeal is as a mystery, which holds you; it is also quite beautiful in its photography, and haunting music. What I took away with me however is the horrific ending.<br />Now, there is a twist at the end, as in many films, but the impact is made by the sheer horror of the lead character facing being burned alive, watched by happy islanders singing and dancing against a backdrop of the island coast. The strength of Edward Woodward's character is his fallibility: he is a priggish, unforgiving Christian - maybe this makes him easier to identify with, rather than a paragon. As he is led up the hill to the place where he will die, he literally freaks out. Before he dies, he begs forgiveness, in an outpouring of passion and anger. <br />The parallel of the sacrifice is obvious but powerful, and Woodward's performance amazing. The Wicker Man rises above its place as a horror/mystery to become a parable of how a community can be brainwashed, of how evil can spread, and ultimately as a disturbing and unforgettable portrayal of one man's refusal to abandon his faith in the face of death. It moves and inspires.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I admit to have never been a Velvet Underground fan, so when I realized after two tracks that this CD was basically nothing more than a Velvet tribute album assembled by a single band I sold it quick.<br />><br />I do believe that it's possible to pay tribute to one's musical inspiration without becoming nothing more than a knock-off of the original; the Dandy Warhols even succeeded in a Velvet Underground tribute on their debut with \\"(This Song Is Called) Lou Weed\\" without compromising their own identity.<br />><br />But the bottom line is if you are a Velvet Underground fan, why would you not choose to listen to the Velvet Underground instead of these wanna-be's?  \\"Is This It?\\", indeed.

B00005JKLZ|1.0|Hollywood has often been afflicted with a disease. Call it \\"Dumb-it-down Syndrome\\" if you like. But this latest exploding pustule is one of its rankest and most vile manifestations.<br />There is not a single braincell of the book left in tact, despite the book being popular enough to be in print for over a century. Moronic in extremis, this latest adaptation leaves little scope for the target audience (teen boys) to go on to reading the actual book (and then on to other books), as they would recognise almost nothing (unlike the Pal film). <br />Anyone who thinks that a faithful adaptation would not have found an audience needn't go any further than the one-man stage adaptation of the book, recently staged twice in my local area. A mesmerizing hour, with a chair as the only prop!<br />Ironically, the \\"South Park\\" adaptation of Great Expectations - complete with Miss Havesham's army of robot monkeys - is a vastly more faithful adaptation of a book than Simon Wells' The Time Machine. It's painful to read in the introduction of the latest reprint of the novel how Simon Wells, as H.G. Wells' great-grandson, always wanted to make a movie of the book. My question is, why didn't he?<br />Get the George Pal DVD instead. Forget last year's remake. Just forget it.

0446310786|4.0|It's quite pitiful that so many people don't see the beauty and Southern grace that is infiltrated all through this book. I've never been in Alabama, but I've had enough contact with Southern types of people and this is a very accurate portrayal: time moves slowly, everyone takes it easy...<br />I watched this movie earlier this year and was completely taken by it. But I'm not reviewing the movie. The book was just as good. Every time I put it down I just wanted to pick it up and go on reading.<br />It was, contrary to several reviewers' statements, very easy to follow. Yes, it can be a bit scattered at times, but much of its charm lies in the child's narration, surprisingly mature at times and yet all the same naive. It flows along slowly but never once drags. And I like the dialect. Of course we all knows Southern folk have awful grammar, but I don't rightly think that ought to matter. If you ever lived around folks who talks like this, you'll realise how very authentic it is. Adds a touch, like.<br />Overall I felt this was a very moving story. I must say that every time I read Atticus' words I just heard Gregory Peck saying them. The way Scout describes her father's voice matches Gregory's so perfectly...<br />I'm already reading this a second time, and I hardly ever read books again just after finishing them. Let that be my recommendation after my wandering review.
0790729628|4.0|I love this movie... however, in my humble opinion the directors cut blew it by eliminating Harrison's naration... which really sync'd this film and blended an old film dark feel with this futuristic dark genre.  It would have been great to have had an option to turn it on or off... but to not include it... I can only say, I am very dissapointed... if I could only get my hands on a &quot;non&quot; director's cut I'd trade my copy in a micro-second.
B00000JPH6|1.0|It's a shame you can't give a movie zero stars.  This movie is a union of Lord of the Rings, bad acting, and a terrible screenplay.  &quot;They don't make them like this anymore&quot;?  Yes, for good reason.
B000067JHW|5.0|When I began watching this film, I didn't know what to expect.  I knew it had garnered praise for its cinematography and style, but little else.  What I found was one of the most original films I have ever seen.  Describing the plot is simple: Amelie is a young woman looking for love in Paris and dabbles in fixing the lives of her friends.  But that statement does not do the film justice.  I did not know what was going to happen next, and the film continued to surprise me until the end.  The visuals in the film are stunning, and Audrey Tautou is remarkable in the lead role.  I don't think I can write anything else without spoiling the viewing experience for others!

The cast plays a wonderful job. This movie is loaded with special features. I would recomend this movie to anyone who wants to feel good about themselves because that is what kind of movie this is.
0790734850|5.0|One of the tautest films ever made, LA Confidential is a film that needs to be seen a few times for the viewer to fully comprehend it.  A bathroom break during the film will leave you clueless.  This is not to say you won't like it after the first viewing.  On the contrary, you'll have a general grasp of the stories in this multi-layered film and appreciate its screenplay and mysterious twists and turns, which make you think and want to see it over again to fill in the minute details instrumental in linking the stories and triggering the actions of the three main characters played by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey.<BR>  <BR>Set in 1951 LA, this film shows LA in its glamorous façade.  Unlike other film noirs, naturalistic lighting is employed to contrast against the dark side of the setting.  Crowe, who steals the film and first served notice as a major player, plays a not-too-bright thug with a soft side.  Shocking Australians with his enormous performance, Pearce, a former Aussie soap star, plays a politically ambitious police officer who discovers honesty does not serve him best.  And as always, Kevin Spacey delivers a top-notch performance through an unconventional interpretation of his character, Jack Vincennes, a morally bankrupt vice squad sergeant, who is able to live fashionably from his side-job as consultant to a TV detective show and snitch to a sleazoid \\"Confidential\\"-like tabloid publisher played by Danny DeVito.  Add to this mix a morally ambiguous cop played by James Cromwell, a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute (Kim Basinger) and her millionaire pimp (David Straithairn), and you have intriguing stories that are intricately yet delicately woven together to create a larger story.<br />The film starts off with a narration of LA the way it used to be:  a land of milk and honey that was gold to gangsters.  The primo gangster has been arrested for tax evasion and other wannabes are trying to take over the throne.  Main candidates for this position have been murdered and it's anybody's guess who the successor will be.  A Christmas-night riot erupts in the police precinct, instigated by the police officers who try to punish Mexican suspects for a colleague's beating (one could see why the police is distrusted by people of color after seeing this film).  A reporter takes photos and they are published on the front page.  Someone has to take the fall.  Ed Exley (Pearce) who tried to end the riot willingly volunteers as witness in return for promotion to lieutenant detective.  The fall guy turns out to be Bud White (Crowe)'s partner who was just a year shy of eligibility for his pension.  He is soon found murdered in a 24-hour café along with two women and several men.  One of the women is a prostitute cut to look like Rita Hayworth, a friend of a woman Bud White encountered the night before, Lynn Bracken (Basinger), who was in the company of their pimp and an ex-cop named Meeks.  As a loyal friend of his dead partner, White seeks to find the killers.  Exley takes interest in the case to further his career.  Vincennes indirectly becomes involved later when his conscience catches up with him and tries to do good.  Their respective cases, it turns out, are linked to 25 pounds of stolen heroin.<br />The performances are superb and it was too bad neither Crowe nor Pearce were nominated for awards.  The fact that they were no-names may have been the reason.  Basinger finally got her due that year but I feel Julianne Moore was more deserving of the supporting Oscar for \\"Boogie Nights\\" since she had a more challenging role.  And as good as \\"Titanic\\" was, this film was artistically superior despite its small scale.  On the DVD you'll see screen tests of Crowe and Pearce and interviews with Curtis Hanson, the director, James Ellroy, on whose novels the film is based, and Kim Basinger.  The film is fast-paced and keeps you guessing.  No one is what they seem is the theme, which is appropo to the backdrop of superficial tinsel town.  Watch this film knowing that you won't have distractions and knowing that you can focus for two and a half hours.<br />P.S.:  There are several historical errors in this film.  The film \\"Roman Holiday\\" Lynn and Bud watch was not made and released until 1954.  And Lana Turner became involved with Johnny Stompanato after 1951.
B00005UK1F|4.0|After reading all the other reviews I was hoping for what i would consider a five star CD to be, but it wasn`t.<BR>I am not sure about many things, the first are the vocals<BR>not so flash and the guitars ordinary (basic) the keys and the<BR>drums are good but not great the production good not great<BR>and the material tired (no operation mind crime !)<BR> EDIT, ITS ABOUT 2 WEEKS SINCE I WROTE THE REVIEW AND I`M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY ITS MUCH BETTER THAN I GAVE IT CREDIT FOR AT FIRST, I AM GOING TO TO GIVE IT ANOTHER 2 STARS THATS HOW MUCH IT HAS GROWN ON ME . THIS IS THAT KIND OF CD THAT GETS BETTER AND BETTER.<BR>SO I HAVE LIFTED MY RATING FROM 2 STARS TO 4 STARS
B00000DHRX|4.0|...it's incomplete. There's only two songs from his days in Wham! (which is understandable because Michael wants to present a serious, mature adult side and Wham! was pretty fluffy) and  both parts of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" should have been included, not just part 1.  Also, he shouldn't have put too many ballads and it should have been in chronological order...
B00001ZWTT|1.0|The person who chose Will Smith to be James West ought to be shot!  This is one of THE worst cases of miscasting ever to come out of the bowels of Hollywood.  Will Smith couldn't hold a candle to Robert Conrad.  I'd rather see someone like Jim Belushi or Vern Troyer (Mini Me) play Jim West than the overrated, no-talent Smith.  Thankfully, this film was a bomb at the box office.
B00005B4GU|4.0|The day after Kid A came out every KNEW that the next album would be a return to the basics. Radiohead played yet another snickering joke on us and gave us scattered Skizophrenic collection of songs in the key of experimentalism. Kid A was the dream...Amnesiac was the reality. After Kid A Radiohead knew what was expected, a less abstract return to well crafted guitar song featuring less of Johnnys sonic twiddling. But Radiohead is not known for accepting artistic responsibility for giving \\"fans\\" what they want. If you are a true admirer you'd realize this gifted bunch of intelligent Oxford musicians are about expansion into new territory.  The Bends was a collection of what radiohead could do, have done (yet done better) and what they will do. And Amnesiac was another album like that. Not as cohesive as KID A...they did not spend as much time with this album which is not to say its bad. Amnesiac has either hits or misses.<BR>    Pyramid Song is held up as a fragile gem with a opium den piano studdering over a howl as our character stands on a bridge before jumping into a river. Its a visionary track and a classic from the first listen. A few tracks take some warming up to because they seem to be colder than any of the tracks on KID A. Examples \\"pulk/pull revolving doors\\" with it evil heavt mechinery attacking a lonesome computer drone describing the nature of door that wont open. \\"hunting bears\\" sound like Jimmy hendrix's tortured ghost huanting an ocean surface.<BR>    The funniest moment would be Radioheads attempt to make a Pop song that rivals Britney Spears and N'sync in  \\"Pact like Sardines\\" I take it like a statement that says...\\"here's you POP tune...get off my case\\" Then the rest of the tracks revert back to depressing coffee house blues and Odes to the Smith and Kraftwerk. I laughed when i heard it! I imagined a dance video for it with 5 year old kids jumping around in business suits with ties.<BR>    The bost beautiful and  emotive (often over looked) track on the album would be \\"Like spining plates\\" that is a major defining point in their continuing brilliant carear. The eerie sound of synths beeming at warp speed just as Thoms slow disenchanted voice sings of a lover who broke is heart and fed him to the lions. <BR>   Other highlights would be \\"knives out\\" a suicide ballad, morrisey-esque with coomplicated rythems and times signatures brings you back to \\"in Limbo\\" on Kid A. This is a promise basically from Radiohead that new material they have will indeed lead us to new directions. They closed up their electro shop and where they go now is almost anyone elses guess...but i guess with thom we'll sail to the moon and heaven in a little rowboat.<br />If you liked KID A...then by all means listen to this album and journey into the past with them as they will awe you with Techni-color laser show electronica,Buble gum pop, and eerie pulsating guitar smokers. Kid is stronger but this album was meant to do what the bends did. Not to say expect an OK computer next...but i predict their new material will lead us in a new direction. Radiohead is deffinitly a band to watch in the future...so it would be no big leap to say that this foreshadows even more daring leaps into a new genre...prehaps Classic 70's rock and Soul?
0140186409|5.0|I'm not a huge John Steinbeck fan, so I was a little hestitant to read this book.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  Fortunately, this book was beyond my expectations.  I was able to absorb the characters depths.  John Steinbeck allows the reader to grasp each and every characters personalities and traits.  He writes in such a fashion where it felt like I was actually there.  The plot was fantastic and moved at a relatively quick pace.  I didn't find any lulls in the story developement.  The only weakness, which isn't a big one, was the ending.  I thought the ending was akward.  I was expecting a bit more to happen.  This certainly is one of the best books I've read, and it's one that doesn't leave your mind the day after you finish.
0425166805|5.0|This book is a real rib tickler. One of the funniest I've recently read. I re-read it, and often read parts of it aloud with friends, so that we can all laugh together.<br />If you read it with your sense of criticism turned on and a bit of common sense, you'll find 'witty' risable phrases and ridiculous conclusions he arrives at in almost every passage!<br />(I don't NEED to remind you, but I will - the author was imprisoned when it turned out he pretty much forged the lot of the 'evidence' in this book. The so called 'hard' evidence. The silly assumptions, calculations and demagogy he employs, can be brushed aside by anyone who isn't reading it 'under the influence').<br />READ IT, because it's so funny, and because it's a true comic classic. Don't take it seriously to any extent, though... (NOT to say that I mind or dissagree with anything he tries to convey in his bottom line...)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen.  It is Richard Kelly's first film, and with this being his first, we can expect great things from him in the future.<BR>Donnie is a kid who has delusions of a large demonic bunny rabbit named Frank who tlaks to Donnie about time travel, the end of the world and soon Donnie realizes that what Frank is saying is all ture and something must be done by him to save the world.  The movie is brilliant in that it displays this idea, but in a way that is very inventive.  <BR>Kelly uses great storytelling and symbolism to get the stroy across and then uses new camera techniques to add efect.  The film is shockig and excitingly original and it shouldn't be missed.<BR>Be warned, it is a movie that involves thinking, but it is worth it.<BR>Jake Gyllenhaal makes a surprise turn as Donnie.  He does a great job.  Jena Malone is wonderful as his girlfriend and Patrick Swayze is very funny as a self help guru not mich unlike Tappy Tibbons from Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot;  <BR>This film is wonderful and has to be seen beucase Kelly has made a film that is impossible to describe using words, is has to be seen to be understood.  It is an awesome film.
0425166805|5.0|This book is one of the funniest I've read recently. I reread it, and read passages aloud together with friends, so that we can all laugh. If you read it with your sence of criticism turned on, you'll find risable suggestions and ridiculous conclusions in almost every passage. Brilliant. :-)<br />(I'm sure I'm not telling you something you didn't already know, when I remind that the author was imprisoned when most of the evidence in this book of his turned out to be forged.)<br />Buy it if you don't already have a copy. It's a keeper!!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Now, the plot of this movie is good, but what Christophe Nolan has done, was take a seemingly normal plot and made it into a story that keeps you guessing and intrigued when the answer is really easy to see had it been in a linear style.  The story is told backwards.  You see the end in the beginning.<br />Guy Pearce is awesome as a man who has lost his short term memory due to an attack in which his wife was raped and murdered.<br />We see his character tell everyone that he can't make new memories and that his life is dead.  He telsl everyone about Sammy Jankis, a client of his who suffered from the same memory loss.<br />The movie is good because it is done so well.  Nolan is an important new director.  His first film is a great independent debut, and \\"Memento\\" made him big, and now he's directing big bidget films like \\"Insomnia.\\"  He is goign somewhere.  This film is worth seeing multiple times.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great CD. Those who love blues and want a fresh &amp; original sound, pick it up. I couldn't stop listening when I first got it!
0688156819|5.0|This book kicked so much ... its unbelievable. I originally bought it simply because it was by Tim Burton, then I read it, and fell in love. its charming, witty, and i'm going to marry that book and have its children.
B00005BCPC|2.0|I'm begging production companies to stop torturing Austen fans with half-arsed, bad-casted adaptions of her books. I was so disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. The film isn't true at all to the book...the only character well cast was Edmund (played by Johnny Lee Miller). Frances O'Connor, while I think she's a great actress, didn't fit the roll of Fanny Price at all. She was too outspoken & witty...Fanny Price in the book wasn't either. The only reason why I gave it two stars was for Alessandro Nivola  -- but only because he's a cutie pie. Those wanting a good adaption should see the 1986 BBC production.
B000002UUX|5.0|It's hard to debate on which Megadeth album is their greatest.  Many debate on Peace Sells and Rust in Peace.  Either way, Megadeth disrupted the peace by these two phenomenal releases.  Rust in Peace has no real downfalls throughout the entire album.  Here's my personal insight:<br />1. Holy Wars - Your standard run of the mill heavy metal epic masterpiece.  Intelligent lyrics, hellacious guitars, numerous rhythm changes, and intense lyrics.  Dave's end solo is superb.  And the climax to the song is chilling.  A concert banger.  A track NOT to be missed.  Virtuoso guitaring and hella rhythms.  Perfect.  A+<br />2. Hangar 18 - Possibly one of the heaviest heavy metal songs of all time.  The opening riff, the dozens of solos, the vibe, the anger, the lyrics, the everything.  There is more lead in this song than anything and the lead is intense.  Dave and Marty's skills blow away the Guitar World magazines and is VERY underrated.  A concert destruction force.  One of the coolest metal songs ever written.  A+<br />3. Take No Prisoners - Underrated track, but has cool lyrics and a great destructive thrash riff.  A<br />4. Five Magics - The intro kind of drags, but once the singing comes in, all out 6-string hell is unleashed.  The solos, the lyrics, the riffs, the vocals, everything mixes so well and becomes one of the best tracks on the album.  The end solo is harsh.  It is so heavy and is an all out thrasher.  NOT TO BE MISSED.  A+<br />5. Poison Was The Cure - Has a really cool riff, but the singing is kind of hard to understand.  Its a very good song, and once the singing starts, the song kind of goes by really fast.  Very good hard rocker.  A-<br />6. Lucretia - This song is really out of place from all the other songs, but its still an extremely good track.  The siging is really cool and the vibe is awesome.  I give it a good A.]<br />7. Tornado of Souls - My favorite track on the album.  The orchestration is immense.  The lyrics are great and the riffs are excellent.  The solo is tense and the bridge and finale of the song is chilling.  The song is great and should NOT be over looked by any means.  A+<br />8. Rust In Peace - The chorus to this song is smooth and the opening drum riff is amazing.  The verses are heavy but vocals arent that strong, but, again, the choruses are great.  Solos are cool as all and the end finale is amazing.  That riff is a good way to sum up this masterpiece.  A+<br />Overall, Rust In Peace is a totally amazing album and is worth every single penny.  A must for Megadeth fans, young or old, new or veteran.  If you are new to Megadeth, make Rust In Peace your doorway.  You will love it!
B000002J1O|5.0|Here's my list of desert island must-haves......<BR>1. The Who Live at Leeds<BR>2. The Doors 1st album<BR>3. Bob Marley - Exodus<BR>4. Hendrix- Electric Ladyland<BR>5. Beatles - Abbey Road<BR>6. Stones - Exile<BR>7. Clapton - Layla and other assorted<BR>8. Moodies - Threshold of a Dream<BR>9. Jethro Tull -Benefit<BR>10. and GENESIS - Selling England by the Pound<br />I cannot recommend this disc enough. It is so very proper and<BR>Britisshhhh and comical and absurd, sheer genius. Peter Gabriel<BR>has had such an amazing career both with Genesis and solo but I<BR>always come back to this one disc and think &quot;this is his masterpiece&quot;. Tony Banks, never better. Phil Collins, back when<BR>he only had to concentrate on great drumming and back up vocals. Mike Rutherford shaking the ground with his bass pedals, Steve<BR>Hackett is truly underrated and one of my favorite guitarists.<BR>This was a true supergroup at the height of their potential. The Lamb always gets the most attention but this album is so much more satisfying. The intro to &quot;Cinema Show&quot; is sheer beauty, music like this will never be made again. Most hard core Genesis fans already know that this was their signature statement. This would not be a good disc to buy for your first Genesis album. You would be disappointed with the rest, although most of them are 4 to 5 star discs themselves. THIS IS ESSENTIAL LISTENING. Buy it now and wear it out.......
B000002UDD|4.0|Megadeth's third release was orchestrated really well when it comes to the riff writing and rhythm section, but the lyric department is where the album lacks.  Nevertheless, its classic Megadeth and if you like old school heavy metal, this is a good album to add to your collection.  I'll give a quick insight on each individual track:<br />1.  Into The Lungs Of Hell - Great album opener.  Dave composed this instrumental perfectly.  Great riffs and killer solos.  The song itself puts pictures in your head and alone with no lyrics tells a monster story. A+<br />2.  Set The World Afire - I love this track! Orchestration 100%.  The riffage is amazing.  The feeling around the song is excellent.  Metal galore.  Equals to Metallica's Fight Fire With Fire.  A+<br />3.  Anarchy In The UK - I can live without this track.  I'm not much for punk period, but thats a personal look.  They did a good job on the song and sounds good, but like all their other covers, metal and punk never mix.  Never.  But Megadeth did a great job and still sounds good and is GREAT at concerts, so I give it an A-<br />4.  Mary Jane - Contrary to popular belief, this song is NOT about pot, dope, hashish, cannabis, wacky tobaccy, mowie wowie, silly cigarettes, marijuana, hemp, or whatever you wanna call it.  It's a very good song about a witch who is banished to a woodland, from what I've heard.  The song is very good and the story is great.  The finale to the song is great and you bang your head real well.  A+<br />5.  502  -  OUT OF PLACE.  You can tell Megadeth was smoking a whole lot of pot, dope, hashish, cannabis, wacky tobaccy, mowie wowie, silly cigarettes, marijuana, hemp, or whatever you wanna call it during this time.  This is the only track on this album...and the only song from Megadeth I really NEVER listen to.  Just an album filler I believe.  The virtuoso player doesnt even try to put in an effort here.  But thats my view and I give it a C-<br />6.  In My Darkest Hour - This totally makesup for 502. The guitars are great.  Beyond belief.  And the lyrics sends chills down my spine, especially as the song reaches its climax.  Compelling and very deep song.  If you dont have this song on Capitol Punishment or whatever, you need to buy this CD just for this specific song.  A+<br />7.  Liar - The guitars are great in this song, but I think such talent could have been put to use on a song with more meaning.  If you're not a lyric buff, this song shouldn't bother you, if you are, you're going to think &quot;pfft.&quot;  I mean the concept is cool, but Dave just needed to put more thought into his lyrics on this track.  The orchestration works out really well though, so I give it a nice A-.<br />8.  Hook In Mouth - A very nice political protest song.  A concert pleaser too.  The lyrics make you wanna stand behind the meaning of the song and give the PMRC a nice middle finger salute.  The chorus sounds really cool and the solos are harsh as well.  A very great song.  A good A+ for this one.<br />Not quite as up to par as Peace Sells, but nevertheless a classic Megadeth album and deserves good respect for the orchestration.  Overall album rating: A.  It's worth your cash.
B000002OHX|5.0|Let's see, you know about Live at Leeds, Humble Pie Performance,<BR>Allman Bros. at Fillmore East, Get your Ya Ya's out and the other classic live sets from the late 60's/early 70's. Two of my<BR>favorites from that era are Ten Years After Recorded Live (anyone<BR>remember the amazing \\"Help Me\\")? - and Wishbone Ash Live Dates.<BR>It's worth having if only for Phoenix and The King Will Come.<BR>On \\"The King\\" the band builds the song from the beginning and<BR>then just about the time you are pulled in, they stop/start with the awesome Ted Turner stepping on a pedal and soloing away. Every time I play this song around a friend they are casually<BR>listening to it until Ted takes off for the stratosphere. It's<BR>always \\"who is THAT??\\" If you have any interest in rock music when it was actually played and not programmed by a suit and tie, you have to include this set in your collection. Turn it up to a suitable volume and enjoy, it will be one of your favorites.....
B000002MUN|4.0|Tom Petty's second &quot;solo&quot; effort (every Heartbreaker except former drummer Stan Lynch appears somewhere on this album) shows a deeper side of this rock icon than we've ever seen before. The more tender songs here, like the title track, &quot;Crawling Back To You&quot;, &quot;Time To Move On&quot;, etc. are hauntingly beautiful and wistful...and masterfully written. However, Mr. Petty does not let us forget that he can still rock with the best of them...tracks like &quot;You Wreck Me&quot;, &quot;Honey Bee&quot; and &quot;Cabin Down Below&quot; find him rocking as fiercly as ever. Then there's the quintessential Petty &quot;rebel&quot; song, &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels&quot;. Buy this album! Long-time fans will love it, and newcomers will be converted. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because at times WILDFLOWERS as a whole can seem like a long journey with some uneven parts...but it is still an impressive display from a master songwriter and performer...some of his finest work. On a personal note, this cd was the soundtrack of my crazy teenage years, trying to figure out who I was and what the hell I was doing, so memories of those days often have one of these great songs playing in the background. ROCK ON!
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is now my favorite band...I'm hooked.  I can't stop listening to it it's great.  One thing I wish is that they had \\"Grow Up\\" and \\"My Christmas List\\" on the cd but it's understandable..plus I can't wait for the next album.  Here is a briefing on each song.. the cd starts off with I'd do anything, which is a great song featuring Mark Hoppus from blink 182..u may have heard it on the Atticus cd.  Next is the song The Worst Day Ever, which is excellent and has a line you'll remember for a while..every day is the worst day ever.  Third is You Don't Mean anything, which is a really catchy song that when your friends hear it will be like what cd is this it rules.. next is I'm Just a Kid, which is one of the more popular songs on the album and again very very catchy and fun to listen to.  Fifth is my very favorite song on the cd and overall right now, in When I'm With You.  It is very unique and not something you've heard, just a great song with a nice chorus that girls say is \\"soo sweet.\\"  Next is Meet You There, which is a nice slower, somewhat sad song but still excellent and a nice change of pace.  The next song is Addicted, which is a cool song, another that you will know is them totally unique and not something you've heard before...along with the next song My Alien which is incredible, even though talking about loving an alien.  After that is God Must Hate Me, which is actually somewhat funny and upbeat, but tells a story that many teens can refer to..just overall a nice song.  Next is I won't Be There, which is a sorta slower, sad song about breaking up and not hurting the other person i guess, very good chorus again.  One day is next and a favorite of mine.  It tells the story of so many teen's out there.  Great tune and everything.  Lastly is Perfect, which is just a great song to end with, slower and good sound.<BR>Now that you have the low down, you are probably dying to go buy this, as I am to listen to it..so I'm out.  Don't Stop Rockin'.
0738206679|1.0|I was very excited about this book before I started reading it.  By the first few pages I realized I wasn't going to get the detailed insight I was looking for.  The author is not technical at all in the book, although his credentials lead one to believe that he will go into some detail.  He boasts a lot which I thought was really uncalled for.  The research stories are interesting but he doesn't give more.  Novice level, for sure.
0897500482|5.0|The Tao of Jeet Kune Do has to me one of the best books to teach you the fundamentals of the art of JKD (Bruce Lee's martial art concept).  Bruce Lee has certainly been able to harness the best techniques from various martial arts and combine them into a simple yet effective form known as JKD.  In a step by step account, Bruce Lee shows your how to properly prepare and perform alot the movements in JKD.  Along with words, he includes a visual description of the movement and shows how to get the most out of each motion.  He also teaches you that the size of the person doesnt matter but its the technique that always counts.  This book is great for people of all ages and is a must for any Bruce Lee fan.  Whether you are just a reader or an avid martial artist, I am sure you will like it.
068485743X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. When it comes to completing a novel, Noah Lukeman covers all the tutorial bases. I would sometimes come to realize that I was guilty as charged by some of the general writer's errors and oversights discussed, without even realizing before reading the book that I was doing them. An amateur writer really does need these ideas and essentials pointed out to him. There is a path to follow, a road to success within the profession of writing, just as in any other art or profession. Lukeman takes the writer by the hand and explains the common mistakes that the new writer makes, and instructs how to correct those mistakes. His chapters on presentation and formatting, usage (over usage) of adverbs and adjectives, the `sound' of sentence construction, usage of punctuation, style, and dialogue were of priceless value to me. He does a good job explaining writer mindset and attitude as well, knowing that the choice of becoming a writer can sometimes be a long hard road for anyone. Some of the information was, in my opinion, general and basic writing knowledge as well, but good to see in print anyway, merely because some facts need to be written (correctly) and read over and over again before finally imbedded into a writer's brain. Mistakes often reoccur, as old habits are hard to break. This book will be an everlasting reference for me, something to look back on from time to time. It is the ultimate condensed writer's manual.
B000069HKH|5.0|The great risk with any album based on the awful events of 11th September is that it would be very easy to slip into stereotyping and jingoism. &quot;The Rising&quot; treats the fear, the losses and the heroism with great balance and a wonderful depth of emotion. I'm a Springsteen fan (so I suppose I'm biased) but since buying &quot;The Rising&quot; I've played it over and over again. There's not a poor track and several that are simply wonderful - &quot;You're Missing&quot;, &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; are outstanding. <br />It's hard for an Australian to really understand the scars that September 11th have left on the American psyche, but &quot;The Rising&quot; fills me with much more hope for America than do the pronouncements of too many members of the current administration. This is a wonderful album by an extraordinary artist.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I read the hype, I read the New York Times review, I read Rolling Stone magazine article but where did they go wrong... the first listen is like pulling teeth, I have given it time to grow on me but now I am embarrassed to use it as a coaster on my coffee table. Sometimes the record companies are right, this should have stayed in the can
B000002OZY|5.0|A music critic once said of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that &quot;it is one of the seminal pieces that encapsulates all that has preceded it and marks the transition to another era&quot;. &quot;Tommy&quot; is the defining work in Rock N Roll. At the bottom of its conception is the existential dissatisfaction every person feels between the mundane, the politically correct, the commercial and what we all know in our hearts to be the truth. That truth is inside and can only be found if we are &quot;deaf, dumb and blind&quot; to the messages that modern society bombards us with. <br />Tommy, the deaf, dumb and blind kid plays a flawless game of pinball - by intuition, hears no lights flashing or bells ringing. His external senses are miraculously revived one day, not by doctors, or quacks, or treatments - but by pinball.<br />That isn't much of a story - but that's exactly where The Who's brilliance comes in. &quot;Tommy&quot; has more outstanding songs than most bands produce in a 10-year span. They are great stories combined with razor-sharp, beautiful melodies and instrumentation that shows how far ahead The Who were of their time when they produced this album.<br />If you are even a occasional listener of rock, you will never, ever regret this investment. Happy listening!
0792839129|5.0|The best movie ever made for kids and adults. This is about an inventor and his family. They buy an old racecar and fix it up so it runs like \\"magic\\". They meet a young woman named Truly Scrumptious and then go off on an adventure to Vulgaria with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, their magic car. Their adventure includes an evil Baron, a Child Catcher, a helpful toymaker, and many other interesting characters. There are some great songs, such as \\"Me Ole Bamboo\\", \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\", \\"Truly Scrumptious,\\" and \\"Toot Sweets\\". This is a great family movie to share with your kids.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. The acting is fabulous, Reese Witherspoon is a great actress and she definitely was shining in this roll. Wonderful story line, a great feel good movie.

0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas would have to be one of the most brilliantly pure interpretations of gangsters in the United States that I have ever seen. <BR> Starring Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesciand Lorraine Bracco, 'Goodfellas' was written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorcese, although much of the script is based on a true to life novel by Pileggi, spanning 30 years of lif in the mafia in the United States. <BR> De Niro's performance of the criminalistic Jimmy Conway gives the film a naturalistic power, purely describing many of the capabilities and needs of a gangster. But not only is this film ingeniously acted, director Scorcese uses many daring film techniques, such as lengthy scenes without using any cuts (check the scene where they enter the niteclub). <BR> There are brilliant performances by all; in particularly the often exuberant Joe Pesci, for which this picture garnered him his first oscar. Liotta is versatile in his role of Henry Hill, and Lorraine Bracco plays a gangster's wife with pure perfection. All things aside, Goodfellas is a fantastic movie and is one to stand the test of time for many years to come. This film is worth watching many times. I give it 5 stars.
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is a good war movie. I think most people who appreciated this film had some previous knowledge of the event this film's based on. I saw a documentary on the event not long before I watched the movie and I can still remember seeing the bodies of the U.S. soldiers being dragged in the streets on the evening news. So I'm guessing that's why i didn't mind getting so little background as to why the operation took place, what they were doing there and so on during the film. The makers also could've tried a little harder to make us care more about each character. <br />Other than that I think the film was very well done. The acting isn't as bad as some people have said. The performances are actually pretty good. Cinematography is nicely done too. Blackhawk Down supposedly goes into the most detail compared to any other movie portraying the modern military if you care about that sort of thing.<br />As far as the DVD is concerned, I think they could've spent just a little bit more time on it. There's a trailers section as one of the special features options, but no trailers of Black Hawk Down. The dvd has a trailer of Spiderman and a trailer for The One, but none of Black Hawk Down. Also the text the DVD version uses as subtitles is kind of ugly. Those were the only problems I had with the DVD. The interface is nice and it has a nice making of the film documentary. It'll make a nice addition to the war movie catagory in your dvd collection.

B0000027DJ|5.0|This was a great album. It was the best non-concept album Alice Cooper had done in years. His voice sounds mature and clear in these songs. Ozzy, Slash, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, and others make guest appearances on the record. Alice should have put together his own band, instead of just using guest stars.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is the most awesome motion picture ever produced. The story of a hitman, a cold-blooded killer who saves a little girl and takes care of her AND gives her his services freely. This is the most realistic acting I have ever seen in a movie. Those police officers were really scared to enter Leon's apartment-something you do not see in the movies very much. If you watch all the other movies for the second or third time you can see the &quot;acting&quot; that the actors do. not so with this film. This is the best acted, best directed, best produced film of the last half century.
0316666343|1.0|An appealing characteristic of the book is the comfort is has given to people (see other reviews), and I applaud the book in this regard. However, viewed solely on its literary merit, not emotional merit, it deserved 1 star. After a quick beginning, Sebold's plot line deteriorates, and the writing style never goes beyond the level of Danielle Steel.
B0000025GW|4.0|But I don't serve nobody. <BR>I shall grant this Dylan album with 5 stars for the very good music.  The songs are great and well played and sung, with the addition of Mark Knopfler guitar and very neat production. I substract one star for the fact that, living in a catholic country I'm up to the neck with the gospell, thanx god don't believe in no bloody god. Back to what makes sense, the music, I fave \\"Slow Train Coming\\" for the rythm, the flow of the sounds, the guitar playing and the voice of Dylan so coupled to the notes. Amazing indeed. Among the other songs, I like \\"..serve Somebody\\" which has a nice soul feeling, flavored by those unsuspected beautifully backing vocals. <BR>A good album if you take it like it is, and hey! you don't have to be a believer nor a heathen to enjoy good music.
B00005V1B1|5.0|The Camel collection slowly being remastered in England with bonus live and studio tracks on all. The remastering is fantastic and the bonus live tracks are a gem.

B0000640VO|5.0|Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the brilliant director behind &quot;Delicatessen,&quot; &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; and &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot; comes back with a fable that's as close to reality as you'd ever want it to be. &quot;Amelie,&quot; also known in French as &quot;The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain&quot; takes place in Paris, the city where an innocent and angel-like girl grows to become a good-doer, much in a style similar to the movie &quot;Pay it forward&quot; from 2000. However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.<br />In times of uncertainty and was such as these, where everyone is in dire need of a positive message, this movie is it. You will love this movie, and as its poster reads &quot;she'll change your life.&quot;

0440178002|3.0|Shogun is definitely a grandly laid out, triumphant piece of fiction from pretty much anybody's standpoint.  It takes perserverance, planning, and research to put together a novel of such length and scope, especially with regards to all the political maneuvering.<br />However, when one approaches the novel from a cultural standpoint, it fails to hold weight.<br />Of course, there is the comical sprinkling of inaccurate &quot;Japanese&quot; that Clavell probably employed to make the reader feel like he or she is reading &quot;authentic&quot; historical fiction.  There are also events and bits of dialogue that seem absolutely ludicrous to anybody even remotely familiar with Japanese culture both modern or otherwise; the most cringeingly obvious of which being the final love affair which, I assure you would almost certainly never have occurred.  <br />None of this, however, detracts from the average reader's enjoyment of this big, meaty, admittedly entertaining novel.  It's like watching Star Trek or Friends on TV.  The shows are fun, despite being ludicrously unrealistic.<br />The problem is that most readers aren't fluent speakers of Japanese or at all acquainted with the real culture and belief system beind the people.  And so, unfortunately, many of them take this delightfully entertaining but historically flawed fictionalization to be an accurate portrayal of a history and of a people.  Anybody who is genuinely interested in the &quot;historical&quot; aspect of Shogun is encouraged to read with this in mind.  Shogun is correct in overall aspect, but individual details and plot points have obviously been tweaked to appeal to a &quot;white&quot; audience.<br />Overall, it's still a good read, but if you're after something more realistic, try Eiji Yoshikawa.  For more modern examples, turn to Mishima, Kawabata, and Oe.
B000002J1H|3.0|This album needed Moraz on keys for some fresh ideas.To quote Rolling Stone(yeah, they're jerky wannabe's but I find this makes some sense)critic wayne king:\\"the almost new-wave simpilicity (for Yes) that One conveyed was less an effective reduction of valid ideas than an admission of total artistic bankruptcy.\\" Apply that critique to their next album, Tormato especially, and you know Yes had lost the spark that they so engagingly captured on the classic progressive albums of their's from 1971-1974. A short time but one that many bands never come close to capturing in their entire career. Steve Howe said of Moraz's depature:\\"...it just didn't work out with Patrick. Patrick wasn't doing anything wrong. We just weren't jelling.\\" But Pat has a different opinion:\\"...we had written most of Going For The One's parts and I was having increasing difficulty trying to express my own voice...There were never any conference on what was artistically important. It was always economical.\\" And so Yes, persuaded at this point especially to come up with something commercially viable to compete with the simplification of rock, simplified a good deal of their song arrangements for the album and made Squire's initially vigorous Parallels almost a parody of commercialized prog-rock. It originally had an ever-ascending chord sequence, perhaps that idea of which Moraz laments when discussing the endless ascension he would have given Awaken? \\"I personally think I did write Awaken. All of the tunes had been contributed as much by me as the other guys. Now Rick came in and put his own flavor\\". This was where Pat's response was one of incredulity. \\"I couldn't believe that they would go with that kind of sound and that kind of arrangement. .The big difference was the cycle of fifths, which was pretty elementary for me. What I was proposing to the band was the endless ascension, which is also a cycle of fifths but treated differently. Its the treatment (rising of chords) I would have given the end of Awaken.\\" Too bad, cause something's unbalanced, and I'm not just referring to the heavy-handed, overdub/reverb-happy production. Granted, Relayer had this problem, but the songs were innovative and suitably energetic to support some wrong-headed production here and there. Anyway, Rick Wakeman is back for ol' times sake and aside from the exquisite Turn Of The Century, he sounds like he's there as a seasoned session player (which he actually was if you know your Yes history) rather than a fully-integrated member(no, this does not have the inter-band fluidity that an early album such as fragile had with Rick). This is a slick-sounding arena-prog rock album that, although finely crafted in a more stripped-down sense, is ultimately too compromised due to record company pressure and the changing music scene to be considered an innovative release like The Yes Album, Fragile, Close To The Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans, and Relayer. Indeed, Awaken, has its profoundly uplifting moments and is, to my ears, a very good epic overall(with profound lyrics), but with pieces like Gates Of Delirium, The Revealing, and Close To The Edge, Yes already proved their point and took their epic arranging to its logical conclusion by Relayer. Music journalist Paul Stump seems to like what Awaken stands for, but calls it ultimately \\"words and music battling for space.\\" Finally, of interest to Yes freaks, prog afficianado Bradley Smith wrote in his book The Billboard Guide To Progressive Music:\\"Later Yes studio albums Going For The One, Tormato, and 1980's Drama, are only sporadically progressive, with the band returning to less ambitious, shorter tracks...While some of the material on those recordings is an embarrassment, each disc has its fine moments and comes recommended.\\" While Awaken is raved about by the boys and rightfully so I say, I go along with Howe that this album's real beauty(flamenco classical guitar and understated piano)is probably Turn Of The Century. Among Jon'sbest story-lyrics too. Achingly poingnant. Get their other albums prior to this first starting with The Yes Album in chronological order, then to this and back to their first two. It really makes sense that way, but whatever, this is a great band so this album has sufficient enough magic, even if little of the original spark or impetus remains.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Yes, 70 minutes is far to short to capture the sheer variety of themes and passages that the movie possesed in its complete score- and yes, we eagerly await the full recording of it. Every time I listen to this I catch something new in it- and there are parts of this soundtrack that just floor me, they are so beautiful and heart-rendingly sad and powerful. If you have EVER read the books (and even if you havent seen the film- though its a big BIG payoff if you read the books beforehand) then I cant recommend this score enough. You cant be dissapointed- because no matter what your taste is in music, the is something in here that will give you a new insight into and appreciation of Tolkien's world.<br />- The true theme for the Fellowship is heard throughout the score, but is stated best in track 11: The Ring Goes South- when the orchestra puts its full might behind it, and plays it powerfully. It comes across as innocent, courageous, yet mindful of the dark journey it serves as an introduction to.<br />- The way Howard Shore uses startling contrasts in the music to engage the emotions is best exemplified in track 7: A Knife in the Dark- about a minute and a half in. Thats when Saruman's dark theme gets its full treatment, wonderfully dark and crashing, almost mechanical- and then it pauses, as a voice suddenly sings out, hopeful, astonishingly beautiful. Its like the pitch black of a storm suddenly pierced by a beam of light- and then the storm crashes back again, with renewed determination. Beauty interrupting darkness (and yes, you aren't mistaken- the orchestra IS rattling chains in the background!)<br />- Darkness in the score is ultimatly conquered by the truly stunning pieces for the Hobbits, for Rivendell, the Great River, and the end credits. The hobbits have a truly innocent and joyously peacful piece in track 2- it really makes one wish that there will be more to it in the longer album. Rivendells theme in track 9 and 10, is perfect for the film- it evokesfading majesty and old-world grandeur, yet has a hope to it too. The Great River music in track 15 powerful and sweepingly vast, and has to be heard to be appreciated really. <br />And what can I say about the end? At the end of the day I find it's what I appreciate most about the score- it somehow fulfills all the hope I had for the movies to be like I had hoped . . . it leaves the somewhat heavyhanded dark attitude and overdone battle scenes behind and presents the listener with all the hope and faith and beauty that the story is truly about. Enya contributes to this, overwhelming with her May It Be at the very last, and bringing it to an uplifting close. Which is all we can ask of this score, and the ones to follow- that everything will be right in the end . . . which this score is.
B00004Z459|5.0|At the risk of sounding like the rest of the teenagers out there,<BR>I will just say this album is smartly put together with brilliant lyrics. I never really liked Hard Rock/Metal until I heard the second single, &quot;In The End&quot; on the radio and there was just something about it that just got me hooked. I checked out the album from the library and the next day picked it up at the record store. This album has welcomed me into the world of Metal music and Linkin Park has earned my respect as musicians and clever lyricists. &lt;&lt;spelling??? HYBRID THEORY is user friendly as well. Excellent messages are put through their lyrics without usage of cursing. (Don't get me wrong...I'm known to spit out a couple of four-lettered words once in a while.) I would recommend this album to pretty much anyone who is up for something new. <BR>   By the way, my personal favorites are tracks: 1, Papercut; 2, One Step Closer; 3, With You; 4, Points of Authority; 6, Runaway;<BR>7, By Myself; 8, In The End; 9, A Place For My Head; 12, Pushing Me Away. Tracks 5, 10, 11 are great, too but just not my faves. Now, don't take my word for it. I'm just another person with an opinion. But I'm sure a listen to this work will be worth while.

B00005Q3TZ|1.0|The only thing wrong with this movie is it isn't any good.
B00005MNP8|5.0|This is truly a great album. Listen after listen, it gets better.  <BR>The songs range in style, but all have the same flavor.  Just because Deborah Harry is the &quot;star&quot; of the band, does not lessen the impact of the other players.  I especially like Jimmie Destri's sparse synths and kickin' organs.  Harry's singing is the standout though, her voice floats between soft whispers and throaty screams. Usually within the same song.<BR>Standout tracks for me are &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, &quot;11:59&quot;, &quot;Will Anything Happen&quot;, and &quot;Hangin' on the Telephone&quot;. All are great new wave rockers.  Even though &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; and &quot;One Way or Another&quot; are the recognized hits of the album, they don't overshadow the other songs (unlike most albums where the hits blow the other songs away).  <BR>One great cameo is Robert Fripp of King Crimson. He adds spacey guitars to &quot;Fade Away&quot;.  This is probably the coolest song on an album of amazing tunes. Sinister Synthesizers over the dark song and wonderful vocals by Harry.  It shows how a great guest appearance can really add to an album.<BR>Not only is this a great album by an underrated band, but a great album overall.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a great CD. Brandon, Mike, Jose, Dirk, and DJ Kilmore are all very talented individuals who make great music together.  Every single song is absolutely marvelous.  The best song (my opinion) is Mexico.  Definently get this CD.
B00000K3CM|5.0|Best Movie Macaulay Culkin is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Funny and very clever
0792833260|4.0|An outstanding movie from the eighties that took four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, and Actor), \\"Rainman\\" is about the arrogant, selfish and materialistic hotshot car-dealer Charles Babbit (Tom Cruise) and his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman).  Charlie is a struggling businessman on the verge of bankruptcy who doesn't even know he has a brother until his dad dies.  When he only inherits the rose bushes and a used car, he discovers that the rest of his father's wealth ($3 million) is put in a trust fund for his institutionalized brother.  Charlie takes up contact with Raymond, and because his real motive is to obtain his dad's millions, he kidnaps Ray and holds him for ransom.  The lack of sympathy we feel for Charlie's greed is matched by the sympathy we feel for his misunderstood brother Ray.  Charlie doesn't care about Ray: \\"It's none of your business, stop acting like an idiot and reading that stupid phone book.\\"  Charlie's Italian girlfriend Susanna is the conscience that says otherwise: \\"It's not right what you're doing to Raymond.\\"<br />The turning point comes when Charlie's exasperated girlfriend walks out on him after living with him for a year, and only then does he finally begin to show sympathy for his brother.  Charlie comes to realize that Ray's brilliant memory and extraordinary ability with numbers has great potential in a casino.  But more importantly, he comes to realize that Ray is a brother whom he loves.  Their journey on the run is as much a journey of discovery for Charlie as it is for Ray. Charlie undergoes a dramatic transformation in character: \\"I felt like giving you a hug.\\"  And: \\"It's not about the money anymore.  Why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother?\\"  It is this heart-warming theme that becomes the movie's focal point.  Remarkably, Hollywood has produced a movie that shows the emptiness of materialism, and that emphasizes the wealth that lies in the fellowship of family relationships.<br />But \\"Rainman\\" is also a sensitive look at people with mental disabilities, showing their strengths and weaknesses, and showing how they are as loveable as the rest of us.  This is heightened by some brilliant acting from Dustin Hoffman in particular, who produced an outstanding and convincing performance as autistic Raymond.  Hoffman's Academy Award winning performance is enhanced by a brilliant soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and stellar directing which makes you see life from Raymond's autistic point of view (for instance his bewilderment as they drive across a bridge).<br />There are also several delightful moments of warm humor - who can forget the memorable lines: \\"I'm an excellent driver\\"; \\"K-Mart sux\\"; \\"Qantas never crashed\\"; and the classic \\"I'm definitely not wearing underwear\\".  There is a sex scene, but it is presented from Raymond's point of view and involves more suggestion than sight.  Even so, the frequent use of profanities as well as the strongly implied sexual content was enough to give this movie the R rating it deserves.  But if you can overlook the excessive amount of offensive content, this is a memorable movie that has the potential to change you as it changed Charlie - for the better.  The members of our family (even those with handicaps) are truly of more value than the money in our bank.  Now if only Hollywood as a whole would make the same change in thinking as Charlie...ainman\\" is also a sensitive look at people with mental disabilities, showing their strengths and weaknesses, and showing how they are as loveable as the rest of us.

B000007SPU|4.0|I first heard this when I was in high school. Its melancholy demeanor, luscious melody and intriguing orchestration spoke well to me then. Over a decade after the first listen, this disc still remains compelling. The sequence of tracks that runs from \\"Thais (I)\\" to the end of the album is fantastically beautiful; if those tracks were an album unto themselves, it would be one of the most listened to albums I own. I still have just as much fun singing along with \\"I Must Have Been Blind,\\" and I still adore the cover of David Byrne's \\"Drugs.\\" And the ambient tracks (too numerous to mention) are superb.<br />I can't give it the five stars because, like the other TMC releases, it is inconsistent. Some songs haven't lasted as well and now they get on my nerves. Luckily, they seem to be crowded more towards the beginning of the disc.
B00000HYXB|3.0|I think I would really dig Blind Guardian albums if they're material was a little more tangible with the real world.  I won't get into Iced Earth because of that problem.  Both focus on a very taboo area of songwriting that really really becomes the mockery of the musical world.  That is- composing songs about gnomes, goblins, and ooky spooky creatures that go bump in the night.  Don't get me wrong, it can be done right, but anything that incorporates fantasy depictions need to be subtle or at least ambiguous.  That is- the song cooould be incorporated into a fantasy atmosphere, but it could also be translated into history, news events, or something going on in your life.  It leaves the listener open for interpretation.  Blind Guardian lacks in this respect, and this leaves me with a mixed feelings of...well this is really sweet melodic power metal, but the whole Dungeons and Dragons bit is kinda silly.  Not only that, but I kind of feel as though there is just too much harmonious saturation in some places.  How much is too much?  When you feel as though your listening to Andrew Lloyd Webber (think &quot;Dooo you hear the people sing&quot; number from Les Miserables), played in speed metal, you can't help but laugh profusely.  Maybe it's that girl wailing in the background vocals all the time.  She needs to have her parts shortened to a bridge section or something.  Or just shortened slightly.  There is just too much vocal saturation in these songs.  One last thing, if you are going to have little verses and monster voices interwoven with the music, find a way to blend them in a little more tastefully.  A 30 second track with a monster roar is...uhmm...kinda tacky.  But other than that, great songs, excellent musicians, wonderful harmonies!
B00000JCOV|2.0|With 688 other reviews to compete with, it's tough to imagine what else I can say about this album that hasn't already been said. But here's what drives me nuts the most when I listen to this. It's the drumming. It's just so terrible. The guy does that freakin' horrible fill down all the toms every three seconds. Or are there two drummers doing that? I don't know. The guitar riffs are sometimes nice. They sounded good blasted at 10,000,000 dB on the stereo of a speedboat that went by me when I was waterskiing, which is how I was duped into buying this disc. So I guess that's how they earned the second star.<br />I remember seeing an interview with this band where they claimed that they used to practice something like 8 hours a day. I highly doubt that. But just in case they're not making that up, 8 hours a day is clearly not enough for these guys. I suggest that they stop rehearsing together for a while and send their drummer(s) to some private lessons. Just about anyone would do. Someone needs to teach him/them a new fill or two.<br />Meanwhile, if you had the misfortune of buying this disc, why not drop it in the recycle bin, and go purchase something by Fantomas or Meshuggah instead.

0345448898|5.0|Just getting back from a study of children's literature in England, I dove into Pullman's trilogy, (first titled NORTHERN LIGHTS on my UK purchase). I was impressed to see that on the children's best seller list, Pullman was first, second and third! Our instructor warned us that Pullman is quite controversial due to his stand against organized religion.  I do hope that adults don't spoil a perfectly wonderful read with overtones that young readers may never pick up anyway.  Leave the deep meanings to adults, but let the children immerse themselves in the delightful description of two worlds--like ours but different. If you buy the book for a young reader, do not start reading it (or just go ahead and buy two copies right away!).

Finally, two seasons are available on DVD - naturally I'm snapping them up. 22 episodes for around 50 dollars - in digital quality with extras like behind the scenes commentary and interviews with the actors - It would be foolish for me to pass this up. I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates SciFi.
B0000524CY|5.0|What makes this film so horrifying?  So unsettling?  Why did this movie shock the nation and become the center of controversy and in some places, censorship?  It's simple.  The movie delivers.  It's a film about the mystery of faith.  The belief in good and evil.  This film can be analyzed and disected so many different ways.  Some people hated the movie because of the graphic language and shocking scenes.  Some people hated it because they have no religious beliefs whatsoever and to them, the film is unrealistic and goofy.  Some people actually said that the film had no point, no story.<BR>Some people are pretty...well, everyone has their own opinion.<BR>    <BR>    The story is simple.  Inspired by an actual case of Exorcism in 1943, Maryland, the 12 year old daughter of famous actress becomes possessed by a demon.  The acting is simply outstanding.  The movie's pace, although slow by today's standards, is deliberate.  The scene which actually made people squirm and sick, is the arteriogram scene which looks VERY real.  It is actually a very spiritual film.  The music will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, the sound goes from loud to soft which really gets to you, and  the scenes of horror will give you that \\"roller coaster ride\\" feeling that will stick with you for a long time.  This film is so realistic.  When the film first debuted, people were screeming in terror, ducking, some became sick, some fainted, and when I worked at a video store, a customer told me that he remembered when he first saw it back in late December of '73, there was an ambulance parked outside the theatre.  If you have already seen this movie and haven't seen the new footage of the infamous \\"Spider Walk\\", you have to see it!<br />One of the greatest movies ever made.  Brilliant, intelligent, spiritual, and shocking.  <br />Turn all the lights off and enjoy.
0446608955|5.0|This was absolutely the Best novel I have read. I laughed,<BR>smiled,and cried.  Normally I do not read authors I have not read before, but I was drawn to this book.  The movie is also good, but I loved the book more. The movie is more modernized and has some different parts than the book. If you see this book anywhere, pick it up and read it. It will be the most rewarding feeling. I highly recommend it to anyone. Especially those who are romatics like me.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park isnt the most original band, but I dont care. Dont let a band be a cause that you fight for. I've seen some purists here on Amazon.com who are pretty zealous about their favorite bands. Please people, I really urge you to listen to music for enjoyment, not because of your dedication to that band.<BR>      Okay, that said, I'll give you a run through of the songs on Hybrid Theory. In case you don't know already, Linkin Park is a rap/metal band. Most of the songs are a combination of both genres, some are only one.<br />1)Papercut:7/10: This is pretty much all rap. A pretty good song, but it definitely wasn't good enough to become a single.<br />2)One Step Closer:10/10: Very nice song. I didn't like it the first time I heard it, but as I listened to the CD more i started skipping the other songs and not this one.<br />3)With You:7/10: This isn't the best song on the CD, but it isn't the worst. It's not a hallmark on the album but it's worth listening.<br />4)Points of Authority:8/10: If you are downloading the songs, download the reanimation remix of this song. This song is much better off with the remix version's sound effects.<br />5)Crawling:9.5/10: A purely metal song. It's become a single. The only thing bad about it is not very diverse lyrics.<br />6)Runaway:10/10:This is also purely metal. This song is very catchy with nice lyrics. Everyone should hear this song at least once.<br />7)By Myself:7/10: A very medicore song. It dosnt really stand compared to the other songs here. I know this because I'm having trouble remembering how much metal and how much rap is in this song.<br />8)In the End:10/10: Sure, this song gets played ALOT, but I dont that makes it a bad song. This is probably the best song on the CD, it's catchy and fast paced.<br />9) A Place for My Head:8.5/10: Not a bad song, not a good song. I really like the \\"you.....tried to take the best of me....\\"s in this.<br />10)Forgotten:8/10: I really don't have much to say about this. The rapportion was good, metal portion was horrible.<br />11)Cure for the Itch:10/10:This song is almost devoid of vocals. I don't think any of Linkin Park's band memebers made the vocals here. This is almost purely INSTUMENTAL. It really shows off the talent of Joseph Hahn(Mr.Hahn), the band's DJ. DONT SKIP IT.<br />12)Pushing me Away:10/10: This is one of the best songs on the CD. It's somewhat softer than the other songs, and it's quite soothing. Chester's vocals are very good in this song.<br />   Well, that about wraps it up.
0812548094|2.0|I have been a long time fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and also of Goodkind's 1st book in this series, Wizard's First Rule. Imagine my suprise when I picked up this novel expecting another smash hit and instead got Jordan re-runs! Every detail matches Jordan's books but with different names, especially the final sequence with the dark sisters-almost word for word with a specific part in the Wheel of Time books. I can't believe that there isn't a lawsuit in progress over this. I have never been so disappointed in my life. This series started out very strong and then this. What a waste of good talent. People...read Robert Jordan-at least his characters are powerful, beautifully written and ORIGINAL.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monster's Inc is the factory that supplies all the energy for Monstropolis, a city that humans never heard of and cannot see. The energy is derived from the screams of children who are tormented during the night by monsters who work for the company. The monsters enter through a fabricated bedroom (closet)door, scare the child, and the child's screams are bottled up and saved as an energy source. Immoral but ingenious!<br />John Goodman is the voice of James Sullivan (Sulley), the best \\"scarer\\" of the lot, revered by his fellow associates. His sidekick Mike (Billy Crystal) is a one-eyed \\"lover boy\\" and jokester. Randall is a nemesis who desperately wants to unseat Sulley as the number one scarer and devises a plot to cheat his way to the top. The plot backfires when Sulley accidentally discovers Randall's plan and ends up bringing an adorable little child into the Monster-World unexpectedly. That's when the real fun starts and it doesn't let up until the closing credits roll across the screen at the end.<br />The Collector's Edition 2-Disc DVD has several enteratining bonus features: Mike's New Car (animated short), For The Birds (Academy Award winning animated short), A preview of Disney/Pixar's \\"Finding Nemo\\" (slated for Summer 2003 release), and outtakes and bloopers from Monster's Inc. There are also 2 additional interactive features: Monster World lets you go through first day training as an employee at the  Monster's Inc factory (and also includes a history of the Monster's Inc world and a few games). The Human World takes you behind the scenes at the Pixar animation studios and also gives us a peek at deleted scenes.<br />Overall, this is a spectacular collection of entertainment from Disney/Pixar which is destined to become an all-time classic.
B00005OAIE|4.0|When a new artist emerges, regardless of how good s/he is, people are quick to write them off as imitations of well-established artists. People compare Hoobastank to Incubus. People compare Vanessa Carlton to Michelle Branch even though they both came out at the same time. Now people are comparing John Mayer to Dave Matthews.<br />I'll admit that John's singing voice is similar to Dave's, but NOT IDENTICAL. (Also, John's band doesn't have strings in it.) Anyway, I was a little worried when I discovered that \\"No Such Thing\\" is the first song on the album, because many times when an artist puts their first release as track 1, the album goes downhill from there. That's not the case here, however. There are very creative songs on this album, like \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" (though the title is a little weird), which has John telling how a relationship can go along fine until he says something dumb and gets in trouble (I think all men can relate to that). Then there are catchy tracks like the somewhat autobiographical \\"83\\" and the catchy \\"Back To You\\" that should quench your musical thirst. The last track, \\"St. Patrick's Day\\", is a little confusing because the song is mostly about Christmas, and \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" is nice to chill to but the lyrics are a little silly: \\"Your body is a wonderland/I'll use my hands.\\"<br />If you look at the back of the album, you'll notice that there is no track 13. Are we getting a little superstitious? Anyway, this offering proves that there IS room for squares (that's what John considers himself...can't you tell by his expression on the cover?). I hope he sticks around for a while.
B00005AREQ|5.0|wow, how can anybody say no to an album like this, i mean you can feel the energy from the beginning, this album till this very day sounds like something out of a science lab because its very original and instructive in the sense that beck brings a various mix of sounds, you have bit of everything here jazz, progresive and even a bit of funk. Now the song that really got my attention was cause weve ended as lovers becuase right from the start you feel the pain that beck proyects through his guitar and after listening for a few minutes you begin to feel sorry for the fella he cryies with his guitar but with a great guitar solo that really kicks *ss, (you know, that song is number 99  in the 100 greates guitar solotime)yeah, also songs or should i say instrumentals like diamond dust and the beatles song shes a woman make this album great to have when traveling, or just reading a good book, may not be for the untrained ear or somebody that likes modern music instead of good music. A must for beck fans or just fans of classic rock. A great fusion album.
B000002J1H|5.0|This album, recorded in Switzerland and featuring Wakeman again for the first time since &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, is Yes' final really good album, after which they would descend into some really awful dreck geared more toward good sales than artistic vision. But on this disc, Yes also achieves something that they had never done before: create an incredibly streamlined, unified album. Even &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, fabulous as it is, seems more like three different parts than a complete whole as this one does.<BR>The album opens up with a good loud honking stonking number designed to make you realize that this isn't going to be like any previous Yes releases (no twinkling bird noises or mumbled musings on the nature of reality). In particular, check out Wakeman's piano and Howe's superbly dissonant slide guitar work.<BR>Next comes Yes' love song, a format that they had never done before, and one which usually falls apart in the hands of progressive bands (Listen to King Crimson's &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; to hear it done the WRONG way), but Yes creates a perfect ballad that works incredibly. Anderson's voice has never been better.<BR>The next track, &quot;Parallels&quot;, gives us perhaps the first glimpse of the direction Yes would venture towards in the '80s, with big power-rock organ chords and &quot;motivational&quot; lyrics. (and what's the deal with the rhyming &quot;Higher&quot; with &quot;Fire&quot; cliche? Why does everybody do that?) But this song doesn't sink into the depths of later works - in fact, it's a very good showcase of Yes playing straight-ahead rock music with a twist, which is really all that &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; or &quot;Roundabout&quot; were. Hey, if it worked in '72, I say why not try it again?<BR>I agree with the reviewer who says that &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; is just filler material; it's the most boring song on the album, with no very spectacular moments for any of the players, and more cheezy Anderson-penned lyrics. But I like to think of it as a prelude to the great mega-work to come.<BR>&quot;Awaken&quot;: to say that this is the best song on the album is an understatement. It's the best song of Yes' entire career, with the possible exception of &quot;And You And I&quot;. Every moment of it, from the piano cadenza and dreamy soundscape beginning to the grand organ-and-manic-guitar end, heaves with beauty and purpose. It is almost like Yes condensed an entire album, or two even, into one song. My favorite moments (if I can call any moment more favorite than any other) are the first really loud, driving part in 11/8 (check out White's drumming here) and the expansive finale, with flat-footed church organ. Actually, the organ line throughout is great. And for once, Anderson's poetry isn't made up of twee or contrived musings on spirituality: this time they are MEANINGFUL, filled with all kinds of great lines, for instance the &quot;Master of Images&quot; verse, and the incredible &quot;Workings of man set to ply out historical life reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree&quot; (I think he does that one all in one breath!). This song is well worth the price of the whole CD, and makes an incredibly dignified exit for Prog's greatest pioneers.<BR>&quot;Shall we now bid Farewell, farewell.&quot;

0316666343|3.0|The beginning of this book was great!  It had me thinking I wouldn't want to put hte book down.  But after a while, it just dropped off and turned into a so-so read.  The ending was downright boring.  I wish the whole book was as good as the first few chapters.
6301969294|4.0|Absolutely enjoyable melodrama extraordinaire played with relish by all concerned.  One favourite moment is when Patricia Neal is caught at home during business hours by her employer, Raymond Massey managing editor of The Banner newspaper (cf New York Post),as she drops a white statuette artifact from her 20th floor NY apartment, watching it smash to pieces on the concrete below. When queried by her boss why, she explains she loves the statuette so much, it's so perfect, she has to destroy it because she does not want to be dependent on anything. The sexual imagery is also wonderfully Freudian and rich such as the long moment when Ms Neal as Dominique visits the quarry where Mr Cooper as the uncompromising architect Howard Roark is working as a labourer as he is unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity.  He stands there with the large drill extended in front of him whilst they exchange one of the longest most smoldering looks in cinematic history, her eyes dropping to the drill, the touch of a smirk/smile on his lips.  The finale is a classic Freudian moment, as we watch Ms Neal ascend the tallest phallic symbol in New York and experience the religious/sexual ecstasy of complete fulfilment.  A truly wonderful moment given aural power by the lush music of Max Steiner. All the actors have a field day, but for the great actor Raymond Massey, it may have been one of his greatest performances. Nor should one overlook the brilliance of Robert Douglas as the newspaper's critic, who is worthy of comparison with George Sanders in All About Eve. Forget the weird philisophy of the film which would probably be endorsed by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who once famously said \\"There is no such thing as society.  Just individuals.\\"  This is a movie for movie lovers and students of great cinema.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|... but this musical (if you can call it that) is like everything you've seen before.  It has a boring and predictable story, lousy singing and bad acting.  The music is not new but bits and pieces of popular music from the past few decades.  Computer generated special effects lend nothing to the show.
0930289234|5.0|Is Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen\\" the greatest comic book ever written? Quite possibly so. \\"Watchmen\\" is a self-contained story that follows two generations of costumed superheroes over several decades of their history (the story spans from the 1930s to the 1980s). Moore's characters are truly unforgettable: the violent Comedian, the Batman-like Nite Owl, the disturbed Rorschach, the dazzling Ozymandias (known as \\"the world's smartest man\\"), the sexy female crimefighter known as the Silk Spectre, the godlike Dr. Manhattan, and more. Much of these characters' lives are lived in the shadow of the Cold War and possible nuclear armageddon (a particularly resonant theme for those of us who remember that era).<br />Moore's complex story moves back and forth in time, and shifts in perspective among the main characters. As he skillfully deconstructs the concept of the costumed superhero, Moore deals with a host of potentially explosive issues: sexual violence, politics, mental illness, etc. This is very much an adult story.<br />One of the book's most intelligent devices is the alternation of the comic book format with excerpts of the story told in other media: a newspaper clipping, personal correspondence, a psychiatric report, chapters from one character's autobiography, etc. This gives the book as a whole a richer texture and a powerful satiric thrust. Along the way Moore also riffs on classic superhero story elements: the origin story, the superhero teamup story, etc.<br />The visuals in \\"Watchmen\\" are amazing: some scenes are graphically violent and horrific; some magical and hauntingly beautiful. This world is populated with rich, fully developed characters who have complex emotional and moral lives. To sum up, \\"Watchmen\\" is a truly epic story that is told with consummate skill and power. It's a book that should, I believe, be read by both comic book fans and by those who don't normally read that medium.
B000069AUI|4.0|In today's musical landscape, it is hard to find artists whom push the comfort levels in a follow-up effort, fearing that a departure in style will equal a departure of sales.  While \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is not a complete 180 turn, there is definately growth (both musically and lyrical).  Conscious lyrics and upbeat melodies draw comparisions to \\"Parachutes\\" but a crisper sound and tighter chorus loops are very evident.  I see this album (hopefully) to mirror Radiohead's growth from Pablo Honey to The Bends.  Tracks 1,3,5,10 are the standouts with track 2, \\"In My Place\\" as a viable radio-hit but similar to last records \\"Trouble\\".  If they intended on a well-meshed album that would keep the fans appeased, Coldplay succeeded.  A definate purchase but eager to see if the next release can take it to the next level.
B000068W6E|5.0|This is a great re-issue of a classic Ten Years After album. It has been released to look like a vinyl sleeve record cover, only smaller to house the cd. The CD is covered in a plastic cover, just like the vinyl version. Beware though - as this album comes with only 4 bonus tracks, not 6 as this webpage advertises. But hey, who cares, they sound great. Well worth the purchase. The tracks are very good and clear.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I can't recommend this CD enough. From the first track to the last, we get an amazing set of songs from the Flaming Lips that go from beautiful to revolutionary. Not only is every track a winner, every track challenges everything you've ever heard prior to this CD.    The standout tracks are The Fight Test, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Part II, and Do You Realize?? But the other tracks are all solid and actually support each other to produce a tremendous album. Even if you try to skip the other songs, you'll find you'll be hooked from the first few seconds to the very end.    If you like music that challenges the listener to accept something new while still appealing to the things that have worked in the past, this CD is for you. Just give the first track a listen, you'll want to buy it right away.
0312265859|3.0|This installment of the Stephanie Plum series seemed to fly by very quickly, but it was a good story with classic Evanovich humor liberally sprinkled throughout. Thankfully, Evanovich leaves good cameo characters (such as Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's mom, et cetera) in cameo capacity, and doesn't try to make them integral parts of the story - they work *so* much better when they're just dropping in here and there, adding a few quirks, and then the story moves on. <br />This story involves a possible child endangerment/kidnapping issue, as well as assorted other usual FTA cases. Naturally, Stephanie's luck with cars runs out, one FTA keeps making off with her handcuffs, and various uninvited people end up in her apartment. She works more, um, \\"closely\\" with Ranger in this story (and even meets his female counterpart,) while still trying to figure out what's going on between Morelli and herself. This time around, Stephanie actually does manage to brandish and shoot her gun, though admittedly in one instance, she shoots the remote for her new security system out of sheer frustration. <br />This story was very enjoyable, and provided many laugh-out-loud moments throughout; Janet Evanovich continues to deliver quality stories without letting her formula get tired and dull.
0316666343|3.0|I thought it started out with an interesting concept but then I lost interest right away.  Did not care for this book.
0312265859|5.0|just like EVERY SINGLE ONE OF STEPH'S CARS!!!!  i don't know how it is possible for one human being to go through so many vehicles.  i don't think it is possible.  but this is fiction, so anything goes, right?  and with that in mind, evanovich's eighth installment of the goofy & crass stephanie series completely, and i mean COMPLETELY TOTALLY ABSOLUTELY, satisfies, like mind altering sex will (think RANGER and yourself - oh my god!).  the story line is bizarre (of course - what else could you expect?) and the (coincidental) twists many.   as usual, evanovich introduces new characters that are so individual and alive and real that we completely love them or hate them.  the k-l-o-u-g-h-n is totally squeezably adorable.  and grandma mazur is still up to all her young tricks - she won't leave you without a hoot of laughter.  and ranger & morelli are so totally intense you have to stop reading to catch your breath.  or actually, RANGER is so intense I had to stop reading, catch my breath & fan myself for ten minutes.  all in all, this book was totally titillating, envigorating and opens up a little bit more the world of stephanie plum.  what the [heck] is going to happen in book NINE????  this reader CANNOT WAIT!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Alright,first things first - grouping these guys in with such rip-off artists as The Hives, The Stokes , etc. does this band a huge disservice ! Sure these guys sound like Joy Division, Chameleons UK, and the Kitchens of Distincion...remember those guys?? But they are also awesome and maybe the first real good
0385335482|4.0|All 3 shopaholic books are great--Becky Bloomwood continues to deny reality while living with really zany relatives and friends, but turns out all right in the end. The endings all have a twist in them and it's worth turning the page just to find out how bad things have gotten.<BR>You do have to suspend your sense of reality though. Becky's financial troubles are novel enough to be amusing in book 1, but by book 2 you're wondering why she hasn't cut back yet.<BR>But anyone who has taken a deep breath and spent a fortune on something-you-simply-must-have and then left it to collect dust afterward will be able to identify with her.
B00005ASHM|2.0|I broke down after seeing the Brian Wilson biography some time ago, and bought my first Beach Boys CD. Mind you, I was never much of a Beach Boys fan, but I did like several of their hits through the years. And, mind you, being a product of the 60s, I knew durned well how most albums from back then were usually 1/2 filler.<br />But, all of the reviews I had read over the years, and the statements from McCartney, and the fact that I finally got a car with a CD player made me break down and get it. I've listened to it several times, and it simply isn't that good. If this album \\"scared\\" McCartney to conceive Sgt. Pepper's, then he must have really been on some bad acid.<br />\\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" are indeed wonderful. \\"Sloop John B\\" has also worn well. I'm sorry to say, the rest of the stuff just does not have good melodies. The two instrumentals are okay, but that's not what I bought the CD for. Mike Love's voice is very annoying, and the supposed mesmerizing studio work by Wilson is non-existent.  A couple of the other songs are somewhat promising, most notably \\"I'm Waiting For The Day,\\" but by the time you're punished by the awful \\"Here Today\\" and the way-overrated (judging by the other on-line reviews) \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times,\\" the listener should be aware that this is just an average Beach Boys CD.  <br />I think most of the folks who have given this effort 4 or 5 stars are big Beach Boys fans, period, and have hypnotized themselves into thinking this is a Brian Wilson masterpiece.  To me, a 5 star review should be for an album that can stand on its own to the casual listener.  This ain't it.  And, no matter how many superlatives are heaped on Wilson, the bottom line is that 3/4 of this CD is just marginal stuff, especially for him.<br />There is no question that Brian Wilson wrote some beautiful and wonderful music, but I think they were mostly released as singles through the years. \\"Rubber Soul\\" by the Beatles made Wilson endeavor to make \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  In reality, the Beatles had absolutely nothing to worry about.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is a leader and wants his or her company to excel.  I highly recommend it!
B0000021RL|3.0|Oh yeah, the jazzy stuff on the first few selections of this CD are slightly interesting, but after 28 years of reflection, they are also rather boring.  For how tight Chicago's instrumentals could be, it is best to listen to \\"It Better End Soon\\" on Chicago II.  These seem just to be Chicago's attempts for some sort of further Downbeat acceptance.<br />\\"Lifesaver\\" is a fun song, but also points out how Robert Lamm's voice had mysteriously left him for this album.  I know that he's supposed to sound like he's singing through a megaphone, but then \\"Skinny Boy\\" shows once and for all that Lamm must have taken a hit to the throat at some point.<br />Terry Kath's \\"Byblos\\" is the standout on this CD, in my opinion.  Kath had a singing voice that could give out more emotion in one verse than Peter Cetera could do in the entire Chicago catalog.  The \\"horn\\" songs just aren't up to snuff.  \\"Call On Me,\\" \\"Women Don't Want To Love Me,\\" and \\"I've Been Searchin' So Long\\" are all acceptable, but just not up to their best from Transit Authority to Chicago V.<br />While this is a decided improvement over Chicago VI, it simply serves as a reminder as to how this once-great group was continuing a slow, but certain slide into pop...
B00006690H|5.0|I love this cd. My favorite songs are the eminem show, halay song,without me,white american,and my most favorite is cleaning out my closet.I use to never lisen to rap until my cousin told me to listen to the song cleaning out my closet. I does beepout most of the swear words. But missed some but that just give it some felling.       YOU ROCK EMINEM!!
B000066C6Z|5.0|During my military service I saw 'Top Secret' at least 30-40 times. Several people in our small unit were nicknamed after characters from it, and after watching it so many times it's still so funny, minute by minute. Every time you see it you discover new details that makes you laugh more. It's not just a laugh machine, it's a comedy masterpiece that was polished to perfection by genious codemy writers, no less.
B000001Y79|5.0|This particular album from one of the best California bands (if not THE best), NO DOUBT, is my favorite from them. The album flows so extremely well from one song to the next, it's almost like one complete entity, instead of song by song. It is a very eccentric album with wild guitars and strings and it contains just about every musical instrument in existence played on the album! The songs have a very rich sound to them with all the instruments played in them, including trumpets and keyboards. A good example of this is in &quot;The Climb&quot; and &quot;Happy Now?&quot;, two of my favorite songs on the album, but really all the songs are my favorites; there is not one song on this album I don't like! I really recommend this album to anyone and everyone who likes great, melodic music. Also, Gwen's voice in the album is superb as well. It has kind of a hypnotic sound to it at the same time as a beautiful voice for a female. After all, she's just a girl and she deserves respect and credit where credit is due.
B00000JZIK|5.0|This is the movie the made Kevin Spacey one of my all time favorite actors.  It reminds me of old film noir and it kept me guessing until the end.  I LOVE it!  A must have on DVD so that I can see extra footage and behind the scenes.  I won't give plot as it would ruin the wonderful build up this film provides.  Violent, definately NOT for children under 15 in my opinion.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is one of the best war movies ever made.  First of all, it is based on the true-life experiences of Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (of the brutal battle of La Drang in Vietnam) and it is based on his book \\"We Were Soldiers\\".  Second, it is the only movie that shows how the war affects both the men in the battlefield and their wives and families back home.  Third, it depicts the thought processes and the stories of the commanders and soldiers on both sides -- the U.S. and the Vietnamese armies.  Fourth, the movie shows what really happens on the battlefield -- in war, men die for their comrades in arms and not so much for political or moral causes.   The actors in the movie are outstanding:  Mel Gibson as Hal Moore, Sam Elliot as the Sergeant-Major, and Madeline Stowe as Hal Moore's courageous wife.  The director/writer is Randall Wallace, the same writer who wrote the script for \\"Braveheart.\\"   I loved this movie because not only does it offer great performances but the story and acting are all true-to-life.  It is not a \\"Hollywood\\" war movie.  I bet you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did. Highly recommended!
B00006FXB6|5.0|If \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" doesn't explode, sell 20 million copies and change the face of popular music today, it won't be because the Queens don't deserve that level of attention. This is one of the most thoughtfully developed bodies of music I've heard in the last ten years. \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is destined to be a classic, on par with Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. QOTSA shows the depth of their musical talent, the broadness of their senses of humor, and a witty intelligence through the collection of songs on SFTD. The diversity they show on \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" makes them stand out in a sea of musical clones. Yes, Dave Grohl and Mark Lanegan make significant contributions to this album, but the artistry and wit of Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri are really the driving force behind the Queens. Buy this CD, you won't regret it.
6305922748|5.0|In a nutshell, this is one of the funniest films ever made. The acting is brilliant, the ad libbing clever, and the entire concept is a hoot. On my &quot;Top 10 Comedies of All Time&quot; list.
B00006690H|5.0|Omg This is my FAVORATE CD!!!!!!! I heard \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" and had to have it. I thought that I might not like the rest of the songs but i love them ALL!!!! Some of the skits are stupid though. For example: Paul Rosenburg just repeats \\"Don't take ur BEEP! gun outta the house. I repeat...\\" and so on. No point whatsoever that I understand. Another problem is that they cut out \\"Drips\\"( which I have never heard, but I saw a reveiw for it on the explicit version and i can understand them having trouble editing it)<BR>My advice: If u liked Without Me or White America get this CD.

0312243022|4.0|Cunningham received the Pen/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize for this book in 1999.<br />We meet three women in this story. The first woman we meet is the author Virginia Wolff, living in London in the 1920'ies. We enter the story while she is writing \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". The second woman we meet, Laura Brown, is living in LA in the late 1940'ies, and reading \\"Mrs Dalloway\\". She is a 30'ish woman, married with one son, pregnant with child number two. She is the housewife struggling both with her self-image/identity, and with something as trivial as how to prepare the perfect cake for her husband's birthday. Slightly claustrophobic from the life that is closing in on her, she sets out driving, checking in to a hotel, just to be able to sit alone and read.. The third woman we meet is present day Clarissa Vaughn, a gay woman in her 50'ies, working as a literary agent and living in Greenwich Village. She is planning a party for her dying friend and ex-lover Richard. He has just received a major literary award, and Clarissa wants to celebrate the reward.<br />What starts out as three separate stories, Cunningham masterfully weaves into one gripping story in the end. Very impressive!<br />I had not read Mrs. Dalloway before reading this book and I know for sure that I would have enjoyed the book even more if I had been familiar with Virginia Wolff's writing prior to reading \\"The Hours\\". Because what to me in the beginning seemed to be meaningless jumping back and forth between three women, would instead probably have appeared to be elegant and seamless shifting between the three protagonists' stories.<br />Having said that, I really enjoyed the book. I am going to read \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" and then re-read \\"The Hours\\". An enjoyable read!
B000002NFM|5.0|It's ashame that Prodigy hasn't come out with anything that can equal this titanic, energized cd. I mean just listen to Breathe or Serial Thrilla, or even Disel Power! You are blown away by the raw base and hype cords. If you haven't heard Prodigy yet, you definitely want to pick up this cd! I am listening to it right now!
B000069AUI|5.0|This is all I hoped the album would be and more! Ever since parachutes came out I wanted to know what the follow up would sound like. It's by far the best album this year. If you like Travis or Radiohead this is the album for you.
B00005QIPH|2.0|To call The Strokes the saviors of rock is rediculous. Granted some of the songs are catchy, i.e. \\"Last Night\\". But this band is anything but talented. Many of the songs have at most 4 cords. COME ON... FOUR CHORDS! \\"Hard to explain\\" has one or two chords in the ENTIRE song! Until the \\"saviors of rock\\" can be less predictable, then the state of rock and roll will continue to fail.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I was always a fan of THE FOG if only because John Carpenter and company proved they would not imitate HALLOWEEN (which would have been easy considering the rest of the world did!).  Straying away from the slasher mold, the same production team decided to make an old-fashioned ghost story about spirits of wronged lepers taking revenge on a town built from their stolen fortunes.<br />This DVD special edition includes the widescreen version as well as the pan and scan version.  Both are very cleaned up, though I did notice some extreme edge enhancements on the widescreen in the &quot;ship scenes&quot;.  But it looks better than it did on-screen!<br />Included is an extensive 27 minute documentary as well as commentary from Carpenter and Debra Hill.  The DVD is a VAST improvement over the video.<br />It's a creepy movie with lots of atmosphere.  And the REAL first time Jamie Lee Curtis and mom Janet Leigh teamed up for a horror movie (forget that hoopla about H2O!).  The actors are great, the moos is tense, and the effects are proof that CGI still has a ways to go to compete with movies like THE FOG -- where you can almost reach out and touch everything.
B00006690H|5.0|I love this cd. The song white american, welcome back,and Cleaning out my closet are some of the best songs I have heard in rap ever. I use to never listen to rap but I turn it on just to listen to his music. It does miss some swear words but it kind of gave it some felling. My favorite song is CLeaning out my closet.      YOU ROCK EMINEM!!!!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|In a small swiss village there lived a woodcarving toymaker named Gheppeto who just made his latest masterpiece of a puppet named Pinocchio (Later voiced by Dick Jones) and a homeless talking Cricket named Jimminy (Voiced by Cliff Edwards)moves in. Gheppeto asks a blue fairy for a special wish to be granted for his puppet to be a real boy yet it comes true as Pinocchio comes to life yet he's not a real boy yet. His task in order to become a real flesh-and-blood boy is that he must be brave, truthful and unselfish and that the fairy assigns Jimminy as his conscience to help him along the straight and arrow path but the next day as Pinocchio skips school as he goes into many adventures into so much temptations such as trying to be a star no thanks to a sleazy puppeteer named Stromboli to Pleasure Island where naughty boys have nothing but fun and of course trying to find his missing father in the stomach of a whale named Monstro.<br /><br />Brilliantly animated classic that has stood the test of time for many generation's since it's release, it's Walt Disney's second animated movie after his stunning first animated movie \\"Snow White\\" but i think this one surpassed that one in terms of animation, art and storytelling. Here this movie offers dark edges that might be scary for young children just like the earlier Snow White but it's got something for everyone like the memorable \\"When you Wish Upon a Star\\" song to \\"High Diddly-Dee\\" with unforgettable characters that i believe made it Walt Disney's masterpiece and a childhood favorite of mine for many years.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers amazing picture and sound quality that is restored to wondeful quality and offers terrific extras like trivia track, deleted scenes, a 56 minute documentary, audio commentary, music video, disney song selection karakoe singalongs, two featurettes, still galleries, trailers and a bonus DVD disc of the movie.
0446608955|5.0|I first saw the movie, bought the music soundtrack and now just finished the book.  It was very good.  It brought out emotions in me which never happens especially with a book. You just feel good after to read it.  I would recommend this to every women out there.  I just gave it to my co-worker to read.  Maybe I'm just hoping for this type of guy in my life---TRUE LOVE!!--hahaha.  Well hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I really don't know how to tell you how beautifully Norah Jones sings.  The arrangements are stunningly simple.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This girl is simply amazing. I first heard her on the radio and I pictured an older woman because her voice is far beyond her age and her lyrics are incredibly deep.  I pop this in my cd player in my car and keep it in there for days, just going through the cd over and over again. The songs are relaxing and overall satisfying throughout. The instrumentation is excellent and her voice continues to amaze me everytime I listen to it.  Her lyrics suggest that she's an experienced and very intelligent young woman; it's a great cd and I'd recommend it to anyone, it's just such a pleasure to listen to.
1558807381|1.0|This movie did deserve one star, because the Lord of Darkness looked pretty cool, and was played well by Tim Curry, but the rest of it was very stupid.  I mean, sure, any little kid would want to see this because it has a lot to do with fairy tales and unicorns, but come on, you can see that the horns were probably glued on to white horses' heads, they shook when the horses ran.  If they were real horns, they would not shake, so it was very farfetched.  The creatures were impish and stupid looking, especially that almost-naked little elfish thing that sounded like Frieza from Dragon Ball Z.  I slept through the end, so I couldn't tell you about that.  If you want a good Ridley Scott film, try looking at &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but avoid this one.
B000003N7K|5.0|On this album, Trane is his usual brilliant self, in a more subdued, ballad role than many will be used to.  His utter genius is clear through his understated phrases, flitting through the soundscape of the album.<br />What really makes the album, however, is Hartman's impeccable singing.  This is not to say, of course, that Trane is not an indispensable part of the album (nor are the rest of the personell), but that Hartman really carries this record.<br />You honestly cannot go wrong with any track on this album.  Each and every one is a gem, creating an otherwordly sense of serenity and beauty throughout all six tracks.  &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; shines brightly as a definitive recording, with Hartman's lush baritone lazily soaring through the one-and-a-half octive range of the song.<br />This record is especially significant when compared with other offerings from Trane's quartet--&quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, etc.  Here the quartet (+ Hartman) manage to display not only their versatility, but their impeccable musicianship and legendary talent.<br />I truly wish I could give this historic album more than 5 stars.  In my entire collection, there is not a more poignant, beautiful, and tender disc to be found.
B00005JKDR|5.0|i loved this movie! the animated shorts were excellent as well
B00003BDXG|5.0|I ultimately object to NBK's theme, but it's a good movie in a general sense: well done and fun to watch.<br />Mickey and Mallory, although they're murderers, have more life in them than anyone else in the movie. They are given superhuman strength and vitality (or, perhaps, merely human, contrasted with a subhuman society) as characterization---it's their will, their love and defiance that are strong; these manifest themselves physically in an age that worships violence. Compare Mickey with George Bernard Shaw's Don Juan: \\"[He] follows his own instincts, without regard to the common, statute, or canon law; and therefore, whilst gaining the ardent sympathy of our rebellious instincts (which are flattered by the brilliances with which [he] associates them), finds himself in mortal conflict with existing institutions, and defends himself by force as unscrupulously as a farmer defends his crops against vermin.\\"<br />And the institutions here are like vermin. Tommy Lee Jones' cop is genuinely sadistic, Robert Downey Jr.'s reporter is genuinely amoral, and \\"Officer Scagnetti\\" is genuinely depraved, sick, and psychotic. The authorities are old, tired, practically impotent: they don't dare attack M & M till they've stun-gunned and maced them. To the extent that NBK exposes the moral hypocrisy of modern society, I dig it. This movie tears the mask off of our appetite for murder news and it assigns sadistic law enforcers to a lower rung in hell than criminals. The fact that we needed such a wake-up call is more frightening than the film's violence.<br />Of this violence much has been said; to me, it was cartoony and not usually disturbing. Only one of the movie's three really horrifying moments is violent: when Jones, jumping at the opportunity for cruelty, clamps a convict's nose with pliers. The other two scenes I mean are these: When Downey Jr. decides he's a natural born killer, dumps his wife and calls his mistress; and when Scagnetti, alone in the cell with Mallory, gets so delirious with erotic excitement that it's sickening to watch.<br />M & M are the only moral people in the film---except the Indian. The Indian alone avoids being a sheep or parasite without becoming a murderer. But he has no motive except detached resignation to fate. Mickey repeatedly invokes fate, too; but he's fate's agent, not its patient.  This brings me to my objection to Oliver Stone's movie.<br />The killers are born killers; the weak are (presumably) born weak. The cop & the anchorman who try to become killers cannot do so, even when they kill: they remain weak; they can't change their fate. Yet they are the ones in authority, with law and \\"morality\\" on their side. It seems Oliver Stone is spinning the old yarn about laws and moral codes being merely devices whereby the weak chain the strong. (Note the scene where the prison is opened.) Stone joins his villians in secretly worshipping Mickey and Mallory: it's a tradition as old as sophistry. Our age doesn't need Stone---it needs Socrates.
0671027344|5.0|First, I must say that this book is absolutely captivating. Through this series of letters to an unknown recipient, the reader gets to the bottom of Charlie's mentality. His letters are both beautifully touching, and utterly devastating all at the same time. Charlie takes you along on his first-time journeys. From the first time he smokes a cigarette, to the first, and last, time he takes LSD. His best friends Sam and Patrick seem to be very complex characters, Sam being the object of Charlie's desire, and Patrick being Charlie's gay best friend, as well as Sam's stepbrother. One may begin reading this book, feeling as though they have a sense of 'Charlie,' but later it is only to be found out that his emotional problems are much more deep-rooted and heartbreaking than one could have ever imagined. This novel captures that perfect feeling that one might feel on that perfect drive, with that perfect song on the radio. Charlie labels it with a name, sitting between Sam and Patrick on that perfect night, in Sam's pick-up truck, he says, \\"I feel infinite.\\" And it's perfect, because everyone knows that feeling...but before this novel...No one could ever describe it in words. Five stars, impossible to put down.
B000001Y9I|2.0|\\"Purpendicular\\" just isn't that good of an album in my opinion. If ever there was an album that merited an \\"all right\\", this would be it. The material isn't very strong, Gillan sounds a bit tired, and the whole affair just doesn't quite cut it. The album's sole saving grace is Steve Morse. He plays with a vengeance, recalling more the  Bolin glory days than Blackmore, but placing his indelible stamp on everything. A breath of fresh air that Purple sorely needed, but sadly the band doesn't have the songs this time out to warrant his effort. One of the weaker Deep Purple albums but still worth hearing if only for Steve's wicked riffing.
0790751143|4.0|It's a good thing San Francisco has a cop like Harry Callahan.  No punk is safe with Harry around and if they happen to get killed before he can arrest them, read them their rights and go to trial, well it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Three hoods who have hostages are held up in a store they've robbed.  The cops have the place surrounded and then Harry shows up.  They want a car and after they inspect Harry for weapons while on the floor (\\"this is my best sportjacket\\") he returns to his car and delivers it to them, right through the front window of the store.  You know the rest, but the main hoods are members of the \\"People's Revolutionary Strike Force\\".  How all the brutal murders they commit and weapons they steal along with a demand for two million dollars is \\"for the people\\" is hard to buy.  They hold up on Alcatraz after taking the mayor hostage and Harry with his new partner (Tyne Daly) take a little cruise out to the island.  Fair amount of action throughout and a watchable Dirty Harry although not really as good as the first one.
1573226521|2.0|Somehow--I don't know how--/The Beach/ managed to stay engaging enough to keep me reading until the end, but the more I think about it the less I like it. Author Alex Garland has crafted a retooled /Lord of the Flies/ targeted at a small subset of alternative hipsters in their 20s, the sort of people one sees rioting against the World Trade Organization and vandalizing Starbucks franchises. They are people who cannot live without the comforts of Western Civilization but nevertheless despise it. If you are familiar with the genus species you can understand how taxing it must be to read an entire novel populated with nothing but them.<br />The book's characters rebel against the West by traveling to the Third World. They don't know what they are looking for there and don't do much except swim, lie on the beach, and work on their tans--as though such things are somehow nobler pastimes in Thailand than in the Hamptons. In a telling narrative, Richard, the book's slacker protagonist (is that an oxymoron?), admits that he travels to the Third World in search of extreme poverty. For him and his fellow-travelers, poverty equals authenticity. They barely seem to notice that real people live in such degradation and suffer lives that are poor, nasty, brutish, and short--to Richard and the other pampered Westerners, such misery is just a prop that exists only to reinforce their illusions, no more real to them than the cardboard sunset on a movie stage.<br />Their recurrent complaint about the various vacation destinations they discover is that more tourists soon follow, shattering the supposed authenticity of the cultural experience. Once a village makes it into a travel guidebook, they lament, it's finished. This theme, repeated ad nauseum throughout the story, is a mildly more sophisticated version than the tendency of people you knew in high school to stop buying albums of any band that became popular among their less enlightened fellows.<br />In /The Beach/, however, thesefolks have happened upon a solution to that quandary. They settle a deserted island as a refuge from civilization, although as it happens nobody except other disgruntled Westerners actually lives there among them. On this island, they stock up on batteries and cigarettes, play a communal Nintendo Game Boy, ride a motorboat to the mainland whenever they need to stock up on food which they are incapable of growing for themselves, and otherwise do everything short of actually constructing a McDonald's franchise, all the while deluding themselves into thinking they have discovered an authentic exotic land. In truth, of course, it is more like Disney World than Xanadu.<br />Garland does an adequate job communicating these themes and tells a reasonably suspenseful story, although none of the things about which it keeps readers in suspense are ever actually resolved. The plot lulls during dozens of torturous dream sequences in which the disembodied spirit of a minor supporting character returns and appears to drive the narrator insane but mostly just acts like a pathetic, unintentionally comic swipe of Obi-Wan Kenobi's posthumous appearances in the /Star Wars/ trilogy. I didn't know whether to laugh or wretch, so I usually just skipped pages.
0812550706|5.0|This book is an excellent book! With a gripping tale, a heartwarming protagonist and descriptive narration, it's not a tale to be forgotten. Ender is brilliant(ly written). His character has been fully fleshed out, and indeed he seems so real, you share his every heartache and his every pain. There've been loads of issues that have been dealt with by the author, but I'm not here to make an analysis of style, character or theme, so suffice it to say that this story is so unstorylike and yet so fantasylike that it will capture your imagination and take you on an emotional rollercoaster like no other. and if you're only in it for the action and gory, well, there's plenty where that came from.<BR>I picked this book up by accident at a bookstore and I've read it and reread it a thousand and one times, it's THAT good.
7119005901|4.0|Now that I finally finished the book, I will say a few words about this book.  It's a long story and it took me over 3 months to finished it.  I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be 70% based on history and 30% fiction.<br />The characters in the book are more alive in the reader's imagination than in the book itself because there isn't much character developement.  The book doesn't flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical.  But the events and the actions take a life of it's own in the reader's imagination.  I don't know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation.<br />The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant.  Even though this happened hundreds of years ago, I have to remind myself these people were not simple, ignorant farmers.  Instead they were manipulative, calculating and deceptive as much as, if not more than the politicians that we have now.<br />Of all the events in the book, what I still remember is how people are killed so easily and at a whim of those in authority.  No wonder so many people were in fear of their lives and what they said and did because they were at the mercy of the authority.  Another thing I marvelled at was the scale of the wars and battles they had where hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die just because their king wanted ot attack their neighbor.<br />All said, I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history.  I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable.
6302206294|5.0|I am a huge Kevin Costner fan; I even liked the Postman!  This is one of my absolute favorites.  It is a great date movie....action for the guys, romance for the girls.  Love this movie!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I wanted to try something I don't usually listen to (jazz) and after reading all the great reviews, I thought I'd give Ms. Jones a try. It is absolutely my new favorite CD. The music is so relaxing and enjoyable.  It's jazzy, sensual, soft, pleasing, romantic, and wistful.  If you want to try out jazz, try this one!
0312265859|4.0|I love all seven books in this series.  I think Stephanie Plum rocks.....but this book was a dissapointment.  And I hate to say that.  It's still good, but not up to the first books.  Book seven leaves you hanging with Steph and Ranger; book eight glosses over that.  I wanted a little more romance, and a little more of Stephanie having a life and doing her job.  I gave it four stars because although it wasn't what I was hoping for, any book that makes me laugh until my eyes water is good reading!
B00005JL3A|4.0|The first thing I do in an age where movies aren't very good is prepare myself to watch something.  Take for example tomb raider.  I went to the movie expecting a rather stupid movie with a hot girl blowing stuff up.  I left 100% satisified.  Now this movie.  Two hot girls blowing up zombies....  Cool.  Not the deepest plot but hey someone has to kill the zombies right?  Anyway it is a cool movie that was done well, execpt for the alien animation, and I would recommend it so long as you are not looking to give it an award.
0385495323|5.0|This is one of the greatest histories of cryptography that I have ever read.  It discusses many of fundamentals and also simple substitution ciphers and how they are broken. It keeps you in pace with the story so much so that when I learned how the Viegnere cipher was broken I originally thought it to be impossible. It is a fun read and it is clear to understand unlike some other cryptographic books and explains concepts very well. I especially enjoyed testing out trying out the Diffie Hellman key exchange and learning about the possible futures of Cryptography in Quantum Computers and Quantum Cryptography. A must read for anyone interested in learning the basics of cryptography. Definately a great place to start!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Considered by some the greatest album of the 90's, \\"OK Computer\\", Radiohead's masterpiece is still one of the biggest pieces in any record owner's collection. <BR>Its hard to list the reasons why this recording is so important in the critical and cynical end to alternative music's demise. But it did...<BR>This record, with its often gloomy and long sighted depression ambient is just impressive. It manages to evolve around you , and wrap you around in a page of its notes and sounds. Thom Yorke's voice eering and peeking into your ears...<BR>There are about 1000 other reviews here dealing with the record, and by now, youve probably heard it and drawn your own conclusion, but...<BR>What happens after \\"OK Computer\\"?<BR>After \\"OK Computer\\" electronic is no longer another boundary in music... rock acts finaly give in to the fact that the \\"monster that is electronics\\" must be dominated, not the other way around... therefore, rock and roll no longer fears loosing some of its organic feel.<BR>After \\"OK Computer\\" british rock and brit-pop is back on the scene... we forget about Oasis... <BR>After \\"OK Computer\\" everyone realizes how great Planet Telex was...<BR>After \\"OK Computer\\" Radiohead becomes an adjective... a clasification...

B000067FP8|5.0|This is by far one of the most unique sequels I've ever seen. The entire movie is merely a spoof of the original. I can't think of any other movie that does that, or does that so well. It's obvious the writers wanted to avoid making just a repeat of the first film, which is often the fate of a sequel. Instead, Joe Dante throws some zaniness into the plot to make it a totally original story, with just enough elements from the first film to keep the original Gremlins fans happy. I strongly recommend this DVD!
B00005J6T0|4.0|Whereas her self-titled debut album and Like a Virgin earned Madonna legions of fans, True Blue won her a much-deserved level of respect in the music industry.  Madonna transformed herself both musically as well as physically during the creation of her third album.  Her new look of short blonde locks did not go over well with me, but True Blue was an unqualified success.  Like a Virgin could conceivably be labeled  glitzy and lacking true substance, but the same cannot be said of this collection of songs.  Papa Don't Preach was somewhat controversial, but its mature theme and sound announced the fact that Madonna had something to say and knew how to say it to great effect.  Live to Tell is the true gem here, though; this hauntingly beautiful ballad really shows off Madonna's talented singing voice; the bridge in the middle of the song is amazing and truly maximizes the emotional effects of the song on the listener.  This one song surely silenced many a Madonna critic in its day.  True Blue is a nice little song seemingly performed in the spirit of the 50s or 60s.  La Isla Bonita shows Madonna's willingness to experiment and innovate her sound; its Latin sound and feel give it a fresh and calming effect which proves quite conducive to winning over the listener.  I like White Heat, with its uptempo pace and strong beat, but the insertion of Jimmy Cagney lines throughout the song itself takes away from my enjoyment to some degree.  Love Makes the World Go Round is an effective closing track; it somehow seems to combine the new, more emotion-laced lyrics of several True Blue songs with Madonna's more familiar dance sound.<br />Two songs that never really won me over are Jimmy Jimmy and Where's the Party.  Jimmy Jimmy features some beats that remind me very much of Over and Over, and it also just seems derivative of something I cannot really identify.  I know a lot of people like Where's the Party, and it is a fun, feel-good song conducive to dancing, but I find it a little repetitive and lacking a certain oomph.<br />My favorite song on True Blue, and one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time, is definitely Open Your Heart.  Vivid memories of the video naturally aid my remembrance of the song, but musically Open Your Heart knocks down the doors of your mind with its driving beat and takes up permanent residence in your brain's jukebox (which is responsible for programming the finite number of songs you find looping around inside your head on a daily basis).  This isn't my favorite Madonna album, but it is one of her greater musical successes.  More than that, True Blue is a testament to the talents and hard work of the artist; following up the smash hit Like a Virgin, there must have been a lot of pressure on Madonna to match her previous success--she not only matched it, she outdid herself by expanding her whole musical repertoire in such a way as to garner critical success.  With this album, Madonna declared to the world, in bright neon lights, that she was a musical phenomenon who would be a dominating force in the music industry for years and years to come.tle repetitive and lacking a certain oomph.  <br />My favorite song on True Blue, and one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time, is definitely Open Your Heart.

B0000399WI|5.0|I really enjoy the story, but the uncut language is hard for me to sit through. I occasionally see this movie on TV (without the language) and enjoy it very much.
0316666343|5.0|I really loved this book.  I admit that some of the sentences are overdone but Sebold must have done something right as I cried for the last 50 pages.  Sebold's rendition of the character's feelings is so magnificant. I did not feel as if I knew the characters but I knew their pain.  The sorrow that I felt for the dead daughter is still, even after I finished the book, breaking my heart. I did not find the ending pat but profoundly sad.  I believe this is a book not to be missed.  That being said, my sister read it in five hours and felt it was good but not profound.  Hence the existence of Baskine &amp; Robbins thirty-one flavors.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|There are two kinds of drug movies: movies that depict drug abuse as a trandy undertaking, and movies that show it as a descructive force in every life it becomes part of. Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requeim for a Dream\\" takes the later option, pointing to the clear lesson that drugs are a dead end, with a benefit that is only in the short term.<br />At the center of the movie is Sara (Ellen Burstyn, is a knockout role), as a lonley widow who, following the path of her heroin-addicted son (Jared Leto), becomes addicted to drugs in order to loose weight for her appearence on a tv talk show. Her slow descent into madness and drug addiction is the most disturbing aspect of this film. Leto's character has his own problems, with his years of addiction and selling only reap minimal results, and he and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) must survive and feed their addiction, which ultimately ruins them.<br />The movie is filled with symbolic nuances, like the drug taking montage and the surreal editing which drives the viewer into the same depth of madness as the characters. This is further tempered with spurts of graphic violence. \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" succeeds as a character study, and pushes the bar further in terms of depicting the horror of drug abuse. Unlike Trainspotting, which is trendy and upbeat, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is a depressing, often upsetting experience for some viewers. Personally, I think it is a pure work of art. With so many druggie movies, it is nice to see that Darren Aronofsky cares as much about building characters rather than making a music video, as was Trainspotting (mind you, I loved Trainspotting too).<br />For this movie, the DVD Director's Cut is the only format to go with. It has a nice documentary on the making of the film, insight from the makes on how they made those amazing montage scenes, and the best picture quality. Sadly, do to the film's limited release (it was unrateable by the MPAA), not many people had the opportunity to see this movie. I highly recommend everyone who loves movies see this at least one in their lives.ie. I highly recommend everyone who loves movies see this at least one in their lives.
0767817478|2.0|&quot;Godzilla&quot; is just like the creature after which it's named: big, loud, and without direction.  The plot only serves as an excuse for the movie, and the special effects are PlayStation silly.  Matthew Broderick looks blank and does little to spice things up, and the dialogue is choppy.  Oh, the soundtrack has a single from P. Diddy, who annoys me to no end.  I can't say &quot;Godzilla&quot; is a complete disaster, but for an effects-heavy summer popcorn flick, you can do way better than this.
0316666343|4.0|I didn't know quite what to expect from the author or the book itself.  Surprisingly, it was compelling and I couldn't put it down.  Read it within 48 hours and I have a business with my husband, my own job, and a toddler!  I disagree with a previous reviewer that this book is contrived.  I felt it was an open honesty, a use of words one wouldn't expect - Sebold allowed the main character to really push past the passages and reach out to us.  I felt I was behind her eyes, looking down to Earth with her.
B00004WG2X|1.0|This production has nothing to recommend itself other than it's costuming. For the student of costume, it is an acceptable piece. Nothing stunning nor remarkable. And the agonies you will go through in watching it, to study the costume, are surely not worth the experience.<br />For anyone viewing it, this production is pure torture. It is shot in the old style video process, with no background music, and reminds one very much of the old \\"Dark Shadows\\" TV show. The acting is just about as bad overall. The acting by the women playing the Bennett daughters is so uniformly insipid as to make them almost completely indistinguishable from one another, with the exception of the character of Mary. The woman playing Jane plays her with such peevishness one is completely mystified as to why her sister regards her so highly. Lizzie herself is completely indistinguishable from Jane, Lydia and Kitty until nearly an hour into the production. Forget Lydia's pert ways, you'll never be able to tell which pert and peevish sister is supposed to be Lydia, or the saintly Jane. They all run together.<br />And Darcy! My god, Barnabas Collins was played with more life and sensuality. This man is so wooden as to be grisly in the role. You can't even see his eyes, they are mere slits in ghastly pale and gaunt face. Anyone who'se seen Colin Firth's Darcy, which is all eyes and facial expression, will be grossly disappointed with this performance. For the Gothic fancier, I believe this man would be the perfect incarnation of any vampire of literature. I take it back. Anne Rice writes more charming characters.<br />And don't get me started on the dancing.... I was very strongly brought to mind of elephants attempting to skip. The dancing scenes must be avoided at all costs. In fact, I was so uncomfortable watching this entire production, that surely it must be a feeling transmitted from the actors. They are not in the least comfortable in their roles, nor do they appear to have the least affection for their characters. Anything more purposely designed to make you loathe and detest Jane Austen is simply unknown to me.<br />At least Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier were spirited and amusing in their version of this classic. This production has nothing whatsoever to recommend itself. If you think of buying this because the price of the Ehle/Firth production is beyond your pocketbook, you will be wasting your money. Save it, and look for the Ehle/Firth production used, here or on another auction site.
B000063TDY|3.0|Sp, now we have at last Saxon back catalogue being released in the US.<br />But beware of SOLID BALL OF ROCK. Altough it brought us a light of hope, it was an album still deep into hair metal effort (like the obnoxious ROCK THE NATIONS).<br />SAXON really found his feet again in 1995´s DOGS OF WAR.
B00005JKG7|5.0|MGM/UA has done an excellent job bringing John Carpenter's cult classic shocker The Fog to DVD, in fact it's harder to think of something that would make the disc MORE special than it already is. Outside of a boxed set containing poster and/or lobby card reprints there is precious little to add to the mix that isn't already here...well, okay, now that you mention it, isolating Carpenter's score, which was done for the New Line Laserdisc release, would have been a nice touch.<br />What the disc offers is TWO documentaries, one a Mick Garris 1980 fluff piece filled with talking heads suitable for newsclip filler and one called Tales from the Mist: Inside The Fog, which is a contemporary look back at the making of the movie by cast and crew. Also offered up are a fistful of teasers, trailers, commercial spots, poster, stills, and outtakes. Easter Egg hunters will find one by clicking up another notch at the top of the Special Feature menu.<br />The film itself has never looked better, the print is pristine and the widescreen transfer is passable. There are some moments when the outer most image is cut off, but this is a standard problem with the 2:35:1 aspect ratio and does not diminish the viewing experience at all.<br />An essential disc for Carpenter fans. I give it my highest recommendation.
B0000248L0|5.0|Altough Annihiliator would come to release other good metal albums, ntohing Jeff Waters and Co. released could match the sheer quality of their first two albums, ALICE IN HELL and NEVER NEVERLAND. These two albums are breathtaking, really great, astonishing musicianship displayed all around. <br />You can´t miss: theses albums are worth our money. It´s a mystery how a band can record albums of this quality and remain obscure, while Metallica sold out and continues to sell records by the millions...go figure...
B000069AUI|5.0|If this album does not win a Grammy for the best of the year those people are CRAZY. As an avid music fan for over 30 years I have around 3000 cd's. I can honestly say this one belongs in the top ten right next to THE WALL by Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin 4. I was floored listening to this album, and almost in tears. These guys are simply amazing, no other word can discribe what these men from England have managed to do all in their sophomore effort. They have even said they may pack it up becuase they could never top this. They may be right. The album kicks off with an amzing song called \\"POLITIK\\" telling us all to open up our eyes (and ears I should think), and it just simply never lets up, the title track song \\"RUSH\\" is great. The track \\"THe Scientist\\" is brilliant also. I cant believe these guys are in their twenties. This album alone will put England back on top for the place where the best rock comes from.....No words can describe the emotions one will have while listening. IF you are a true rock/music fan get this album NOW, it is the 2002 album to have hands down!!
B00004Z459|4.0|Compared to most of the other nu-metal and rap/rock ... coming out these days, Hybrid Theory is a very good album. It is very catchy and melodic and is fast and short enough to listen to over and over again. In the End and Crawling have great beats and solid lyrics, and the jumpy rhythm of Points of Authority is one of the cd's highlights.  <BR>   However, while the Grammy nominations the album recieved were well-deserved considering the competition, they would have been scoffed at 5-10 years ago. By today's standards Linkin Park is a good band, but compared to the likes of Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins they are musical midgets. Electronically manufactured music just can't match the true instrumental talent and creativity of the early 90's bands. Nonetheless, it is a decent album and worth the $...you'll pay for it.
B000001FS3|5.0|With the recording of The Joshua Tree, U2 discovered more about themselves and the birthplace of rock and roll than any other band had before or has ever since. This remarkable recording uniquely captures the very essence of what is means to be wide-awake in the 21st century, and not just in the 80's. The Joshua Tree resonates with all that life, music and America has to offer, with equal attention to the good and the bad that is encountered within each. While the Beatles and Led Zeppelin found much of their inspiration during drug-induced trips to far off and exotic places like Kashmir and Kathmandu, and bands like the Sex Pistols and Nirvana fed as much off their own desperation as they did on teen angst, U2 took the honest and arduous journey to look inside themselves, and discovered that great music and all of its creative and enduring qualities can and often does come from more mundane and authentic places within the soul. The Joshua Tree would never have been made without the band's previous and deeply introspective recording, The Unforgettable Fire. Much of the credit for The Joshua Tree must be given to visionary producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who like all great producers of legendary artists, seem to know exactly when to step in and when to get out of the way.
0316666343|5.0|After reading hundreds of books one acquires the feel of the writer, the strengths and weaknesses in the telling of a story.  Unfortunately, after awhile almost all the books seem to follow a pattern in style, and the sharp imaging once enjoyed following a story seems to fade away almost to the point of distraction.  My joy and amazement came when I read &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold.  After so long a time, I once again have been able to immerse myself into a thoroughly wonderful story, well written and told in a manner fresh and insightful.  No bland filler to pad the story, and a delicate detail somewhat astonishing.  I can't imagine anyone not only reading this wonderful book, but several times, and then looking for more from Alice Sebold.  The Lovely Bones deserves all accolades and I'm sure will be a classic far into the future.
B000068TPN|5.0|I Have Seen Many good movies, and some great, This is bar none one of the best! The movie pulls you in right away with real people that you care about. It then puts you in the most intense close quarter combat I could ever imagine. Then shows you both sides of this horrific battle. My Father told me about how it was in Vietnam, I always thought I understood as much as someone could that was not there. He always hated movies about the war he fought. He said they were not even close enough to be fiction. But I dragged him to this one because we are both Mel Gibson fans. My Dads is not a touchy, feely, guy but there were moments in the movie that he would grab my hand and say \\"Like that,Just Like That\\". He later told me that the movie was as close as anyone that was not there could ever hope to understand what it was like to be there.I now know enough to say that every one should know, and thank the men and women that must do what you and I only watch in movies, THIS IS A TRUE STORY ABOUT REAL LIVES, Honor there memories and see and own this \\"GREAT\\" movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has once again succeeded at making another album that you will play over and over again. I didn't think it could get better than \\"Parachutes\\", but this cd is phenomenal! Coldplay's honest lyrics penetrate your soul as they hypnotize your ears. You won't be disappointed!
B000069AUI|5.0|The second effort by Coldplay is delivered in a fashionably fast manner compared to their debut. But this does not compromise the quality they are known for.<br /><br />The album opens with the quiet Politiks and slowly builds into the current grower In My Place. Then the mood lifts a little with God Put A Smile Upon Your Face. And it's this nice buildup that showcases Chris Martin's soulfully emotive vocals which takes different dimensions through a rollercoaster emotional ride.<br /><br />No disappointment at all.
067144901X|5.0|We read this book so many times that we had to buy another copy!  My littles ones loved it and so did my older children.  I had one child who refused to talk, but would repeat the words in this book after us.  The more we read it, the more she felt confident about speaking.  It is charming and funny and we enjoyed the illlustrations as well as the text.
B000069AUI|5.0|For everyone who loves Parachutes, you will no doubt be worried about the outcome of Coldplay's follow up album. Listen to \\"Clocks\\" alone and you will know that you have worried for nothing. A Rush of Blood to the Head is a plethora of pieces that thankfully avoids pandering to the pull of popularity and conformity. They have stayed true to their music while allowing for more 'upbeat' tunes to pour out accompanying their always-beautiful ballads that continue to touch the heart and are always leaving you wanting more.<BR>Listen to \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Green Eyes\\" and the fantastic U2-esque and I predict to be next single - \\"Clocks\\".
B00005ATQI|5.0|I just finished watching this movie. Parts of me are still shaking. It's a huge compliment to the movie that I'm shaking from the inside out. My bones are rattling. This movie is a terrifying, completely horrifying look into brutal, violent homicide and paralyizing insanity. If you watch this movie with an open mind and let it take you... then my god, will it take you. As a matter of fact, the movie still hasn't brought me back. This movie is, I think, the scariest film experience next to the Blair Witch Project for me. Although it may have just outdone that movie. This movie succeeds on every level it set out to, and it makes a great, bone marrow freezing experience. Try watching it at night. Alone. And have fun.
0380820846|5.0|Of all Ms Quinn's Bridgerton novels, this latest is my favorite... so far. (Although all the others are a very, very, very close 2nd! *grin*) I adored the Prologue: the descriptive way Penelope falls in love is perfect! And the book gets better from there, especially Colin's righteous anger when asking her Mother for Penelope's hand in marriage! I wanted so badly to scream, Yes! With characters like Colin and Penelope, the book can't help but be memorable. Colin is such a \\"nice\\" hero and one couldn't have picked a more deserving heroine than Penelope. I was so glad to see her return so strongly in her own book after being the ever-present, yet seldom appreciated, wall-flower/secondary character in previous Bridgerton novels. And the fact that Colin, as nice as he is, has to eat his own words in the end. Well, who could ask for more? Oh yeah, there is that mysterious sharp-tongued, yet witty, gossip known as Lady Whistledown who's been frankly cutting - although honest - toward Penelope all these years. Well, she's unveiled in this book, which makes it even more worthwhile. (So, not to spoil the surprise, if this is your 1st introduction to the Bridgertons... I'd recommend reading the other books in the series first. Just in case, the order is: The Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, An Offer From A Gentleman, and then Romancing Mr Bridgerton) They keep getting better and better, which makes me anxious to see how Eloise's story will unfold!
B000069AUI|5.0|As soon as the stores opened up, I needed to get this CD.  I am ashamed to admit, I had the privelege to hear an advance copy of \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" however, I can't name any names as I am obligated to protect the guilty/innocent.<br />It is no surprise that most bands stick to the stuff that sells.  Who can blame them?  For Coldplay, its a differnt story.  There are some reminiscents of \\"Parachutes\\" but, this CD is hot!  Tracks that I especially like are \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"In my Place\\", of course, and \\"A Whisper\\" are all awesome tracks.  <br />This is not to say that the rest of CD isnt good its just plain awesome.  A couple of years ago, I have been heard saying \\"Music is at its all time low.\\"  Well, things are definitley on the up again, thanks to the resurgence of bands/groups that are producing well written lyrics and using more than two chords on their guitars.
B000069AUI|5.0|i hacent bought this cd yet, but i will earlier today, i have been waiting for this album to comne out for very long and havent anticipated an album this much in very many years, and when i get this, i know i will love it, i have heard a few of the songs on this album live, and those songs were great, so i know this album will rule, it will probabily be just a great as parachutes, and maybe the coldplay naysayers will change their mind on this lp. coldplay is one of the greatest bands out right now, ad everybody should pick this up today. i know i will, and a good thing i get out of school early, well, thats my pre review
B000069AUI|5.0|As I went to purchase this album at exactly midnight this morning waiting for the release I was not sure what to expect from Coldplay, I mean how could they measure up to Parachutes? Well as soon as I listened to Coldplays new follow-up I was astonished by the remarkable lyrics and love strucken songs that hide within. The album mesmerizes you by the very first song with it's hard but meaningful lyrics to Politik. My most favorite song is The Scientist, the voice of the piano pulls me in and keeps me there almost understanding what he's feeling. By the 5th song they have your ears listening to Clocks a very musical, light song that resembles U2 in a way. Green eyes, a slow beautiful song that makes me want to close my eyes and smile. Every song on A Rush of Blood to the Head is worth the purchase and worth being a fan. This will be in my cd player for quite some time. The lyrics that Coldplay create are very personal and can almost relate to other peoples lives, I think thats what makes them stand out more than any other band.They have inspired me once again.
B00006GFAB|4.0|With 18 studio, three live, and four solo albums to choose from, coming up with the definitive \\"Very Best of KISS\\" is a sizeable chore . . . if it's to be done right. This 21-track collection almost pulls the trick. You've got the six definitive KISS classics (songs that have been included on three previous greatest-hits packages): \\"Deuce,\\" \\"Strutter,\\" \\"Detroit Rock City,\\" \\"Beth,\\" \\"Calling Dr. Love,\\" and the dynamic live version of \\"Rock and Roll All Nite.\\" The finest song from the four solo albums of 1978  Ace Frehley's \\"New York Groove\\"  is an appropriate addition, as is one of the best power ballads of the late-Eighties, \\"Forever.\\"<BR> Where the album falls short is in the absence of the very best (!) song released in the post-makeup era of the band: \\"Heaven's on Fire.\\" An omission the band should be ashamed of. Also, instead of including some rather average tracks, like \\"I Want You\\" and \\"I Stole Your Love\\" from the band's glory years in the late Seventies, the album would be better served with another one or two tracks from the more recent KISS catalog. Why not \\"Domino\\" from 1992 or \\"Psycho Circus\\" from 1998? <BR> This is a fun album, particularly for newcomers to the KISS Army. Its only limitation is in not providing a full audio spectrum of a rock band whose impact has now grown for more than a quarter century.
B000002UAX|5.0|\\"The White Album\\" is the Beatles at their most expansive and eclectic.  It has such an astonishing and diverse collection of songs, ranging from the Beach Boys parodies on \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\" to the glittering piano and folkiness of \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" to the truly experimental and far-out \\"Revolution 9,\\" and its sheer musical eclecticism can sustain a listener for years.  The songwriting here is very free-form and creative and the melodies are so striking and vibrant that they still don't sound dated even today.  Unlike most double LPs, it doesn't sound bloated or indulgent and has a coherent and complete collection of excellent songs.  It has a level of sonic experimentation and melodic prowess that most bands can only dream of, with music that swims in a grand mixture of scratchy guitar riffs, warbly bass lines, and glittering piano melodies and harmonies.  A definite classic, and it never grows old or sounds dull.
0060920084|1.0|Ostensibly in search of the perfect small town, Bryson drives all over the United States and finds nothing but ugliness. It never seems to dawn on him that the bleakness he sees all around him has nothing to do with America and everything to do with what's inside his own head. Every town he visits is a disappointment. The downtowns are dull, or the traffic's too heavy, or the food is bad, or there are too many trailers. Even the rich ones are awful--they have too many yuppies and they feel like stage sets. He even manages to revile a town in New Hampshire because the people there smile at him too much. <br />Peacham, Vermont, on the other hand, is almost perfect. In that town, Bryson never spots a soul. He also likes another completely empty town, a summer resort in northern Michigan that has shut down for the winter season. It's Bryson's idea of heaven, and he can't stop raving about its spectacular empty mansions--not, that is, until he reaches a completely false community constructed by Henry Ford, who collected the houses of great men like Lincoln and Edison and gathered them into a kind of ghost town for heroes. Of course Bryson likes this place--there's no risk of encountering an actual inhabitant. Every person who once actually lived in those houses is dead. <br />Bryson reserves his greatest scorn, though, for people. Everyone he sees is too fat, too old, too sad, or they drive too slowly. And worst of all, there's those doggoned waitresses! The fools won't stop trying to help him, refilling his water glass, asking if he needs anything else, thanking him for his requests. In return, he fantasizes about squirting them with ketchup and congratulates himself for never leaving tips. He does seem to like his mother, but that's about it for humanity. I hope she likes him back, because I certainly don't. <br />I couldn't stop imagining wistfully what a writer like Garrison Keillor might have done with material like this--a writer who is a true humorist and not justan insult machine, a person whose mind is open enough and imagination is rich enough to discover what's actually worth knowing about the places where real people live. From a mind like Keillor's, the story of a trip like this one might have been entertaining. From Bryson's, it will sour your stomach, glaze over your vision with one more layer of dusty disappointment, and waste a stretch of your time.
B00006FXB6|4.0|yes this is the best cd of this year.  don't expect another Rated R though....
B000068PQ0|5.0|\\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\" should be an obvious candidate for album of the year.  The Flaming Lips have taken contemporary trip-hop/techno/space-rock, fused it with glorious melodic pop worthy of Brian Wilson or Pete Ham, and used it in service of a truly creative musical story, creating a modern progressive-rock masterpiece.<br />While the studio wizardry of \\"Yoshimi\\" is its most obvious strength, the band's songwriting is equally strong.  With all due respect to Mr. Springsteen, the Flaming Lips may have unwittingly penned the most poignant response to Sept. 11 with the transcendent opening track, \\"Fight Test\\":<br />   i thought i was smart, i thought i was right<BR>   i thought it better not to fight ...<br />   if it's not now then tell me when would be the time<BR>   that you would stand up and be a man -<br />   for to lose i could accept but to surrender i just wept<br />\\"It's Summertime\\" is equally profound in its gentle warning against the post-modern, introverted psyche:<br />   when you look inside all you'll see<BR>   is a self-reflected inner sadness<BR>   look outside - i know that you'll recognize it's summertime<br />Even the slightly campy title track manages to move the listener with its clear affirmation of humanity:<br />   she knows that it'd be tragic if those evil robots win<br />And the majestic beauty and tension of the album's musical arrangements perfectly complements those stirring sentiments.  \\"Fight Test\\" alone is one of the most haunting melodies that I've heard in some time.<br />If \\"Yoshimi\\" had been released 30 years ago, we'd still be talking about it today.  It is not hyperbole to call it today's \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  Unfortunately, given the state of today's music industry, it will probably be out-of-print five years from now.  Music lovers:  tell your friends, and get your copy while you still can.
B00000IQC8|5.0|&quot;Clerks&quot; is quite simply the most intelligent, witty, and milk-snorting FUNNY bit of dirty-minded indecency you'll ever watch.
0375703861|5.0|Spectacular and hilarious, one of the best books I have ever read.  Perhaps not a book that everyone will *get.*  I was  amazed by the breadth of ages, races, issues this author successfully tackles, with humor, subtlety, intelligence and compassion.
0440213525|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Grisham, who is one of my favorite authors, spews out this terrible book for no reason.  In a contrived, boring, unbelievable story, Grisham goes through the motions in this long, drowned out novel.  <br />A young boy, from a poor trailer family, tries to intervene in a suicide, only to be caught in a web of secrets concerning the missing body of a Senator.  With the mob, FBI, and an old boring lawyer, the very young boy, who Grisham portrays as the smartest, most cunning person ever for some odd reason, has to endure a lot of annoying stuff in order to get to an ending that everyone, but Grisham, knew was going to happen.  <br />A poor boy finds out a secret that puts his life in danger from the mob.  Sounds like the perfect solution would be the witness protection program?  Guess what, that is the ending.  Of course, for some reason Grisham goes about in the most roundabout, superfluous way.  There was no story here.  <br />This book is pointless, boring, repetitive, and the young kid, who Grisham accidentally blessed with a superhuman intelligence and an amazing ability to annoy, absolutely kills it.  <br />I have no idea what Grisham was thinking when he was writing this book.  I could not recommend this at all.
0451191153|4.0|I think people often miss the point of reading an Ayn Rand novel like 'The Fountainhead' - drop the defensiveness of your own belief system or personal philosophy and realize that in reading her novel you don't have to fall in love with her philosophy and adopt it as your own, but rather, you can come away from the read with multitudes of questions and ideas and thoughts running through your under-exercised brain - about philosophy generally or the state of mankind or any number of other topics.  That's a good thing.  It's a wonderful starter of philosophical conversations and I do think the woman was a very good writer with a great command of the English language - especially as she was not native to it.  Don't let the idealogies Ayn Rand embraced turn you away simply because you do not share her views...tolerance is the path to understanding and learning.  Take the time to open your mind to some deep thinking and an overall interesting story.<br />Bottom line - the woman was an intellect who at least had the tenacity to stick to her guns and could argue her point using some historical basis.  This is unlike so many of my peers these days who dare not spend time learning or thinking for themselves too much about anything.  Do I agree wholeheartedly with her views?  Not at all.  What I do agree with is her spirit of quest for personal truth and a neverending desire for knowledge.
B000006IUQ|5.0|I saw The Edge in the theater and didn't expect anything more then a run of the mill action/wilderness picture.  What I got was one brilliantly acted and directed film.  OK, first we are dealing with Tony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin---these guys play thier roles with extreme professionalism and tact.  And I must add Bart the Bear, who plays the man-eating monster Hopkins and Baldwin must overcome while all the while dealing with thier own conflicts towards one another.  Bart is truly an awesome animal and is worth the admission price just to watch.  But this movie is chalked full of dialouge and feeling that goes way beyond the awesome visual story.  Man, if you like a well told story with a message, breath-taking nature shots and acting that for some reason was over-looked at oscar time...you should check this one out.  It is a sleeper.....I don't know why it wasn't more critically acclaimed when it was released but who knows---that is usually how it goes.  I give it a solid 8 and a half out of 10.<BR>JF
B00006GFAB|5.0|This CD is just the best, it ROCKS! All the KISS Klassics are here, like Strutter, Rock and Roll All Nite, Beth &amp; Got to Choose. I DEFINITELY recommend anyone &amp; everyone to pick up this AWESOME Disk!
B0000691TJ|5.0|It's been a while since I've listened to 'Too Tough to Die' from start to finish.  I normally listened to the tracks featured on various live records &amp; on the Anthology, but hadn't cracked open the actual 'Too Tough to Die' album in quite a while.  With the re-release of Album #5 through Album #8, it gave me a chance to revist the Ramones from 1980 to 1984.  Y'now what I realized?  'Too Tough to Die' is a brilliant album.  Ed &amp; Tommy produced a superior sonic record that rivals the production on 'Road to Ruin.'  From 'Mama's Boy' to 'Too Tough to Die' to 'Wart Hog' and all the way though 'No Go,' I couldn't find too many faults in the album.  The 12 added bonus tracks added another spectrum during my rediscovery.  Dee Dee's demo of 'Planet Earth 1988' made me actually like a song I didn't care too much about.  The re-recording of 'I'm Not an Answer' (a Joey-vocal version was featured on the Pleasant Dreams reissue, as well) sounds great, as does 'Out of Here.'  'Out of Here' would've sounded out of place on the finished record, but is a welcome addition to this reissue.  Many critics gave up on the Ramones after Road to Ruin... saying they put out 4 great albums which was followed by 14 years of drivel.  I beg to differ... 'Too Tough to Die' shines brightly alongside the first four records... in a dirtier, grittier, meaner way.<br />R.I.P. Joey &amp; Dee Dee......... Gabba Gabba Hey
B00006EXCC|5.0|I just got this CD three hours ago and have now listened to it three times over--I busted it out of the shrink wrap like it was the holy grail, put it in the player and haven't stopped listening yet.  The album, of course, is a masterpiece, one of the most seminal and influential rock albums ever made and a gargantuan leap forward for The Stones' sound and image.  There are at least five timeless classics here--\\"Mother's Little Helper\\", \\"Lady Jane\\", \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"Out Of Time\\" and \\"I Am Waiting\\"--but even the so-called minor tracks are superb.  The band are even thinking about resurrecting \\"Flight 505\\" on their upcoming tour; I've always felt this to be one of their most underrated tracks.  The amount of variety on the album, which moves from Swinging London mid-60s pop (\\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Flight 505\\", \\"Out Of Time\\") to raga-rock (\\"Mother's Little Helper), exquisite baroque ballad (\\"Lady Jane\\"), slide blues (\\"Doncha Bother Me\\"), country (the catchy \\"High And Dry\\"), epic rave (\\"Goin' Home\\") and much more, is given such a good remastering treatment that it actually does seem worth the fifteen-year wait.  Sounds will pop out at you that you didn't even know were there, and to have this classic in its original UK form makes all right with the world again.  It would have been nice if ABCKO had included bonus tracks of non-LP tracks from the period, but the album is so good by itself that this is one of the few times I'll forgive them their negligence.  Otherwise, this is a superb album, with superb remastering, and long overdue.  Now on to \\"Between The Buttons\\"...
B0000028M7|5.0|The album that defined AIC's career. And an album that defined as eara in music called grunge, along with pearl jams ten, nirvana's nevermind and in utero,soundgarden's badmoterfinger etc. With dirt, there are only that of maybe 2 duds, the rest is just great.  Songs like dam that river, rain when I die, down in a hole, sickman, rooster, junkhead, the title track dirt, godsmack with it's wavy vocals then bursting into a killer chorus, angry chair(same with godsmack), and would are all great rock tunes. Definetly go out and buy this.
6301969294|3.0|I was introduced to the work of Ayn Rand through her masterpiece<BR>novel, &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot;  I think that, whether you agree with<BR>the author's ideas or disagree, the book makes you think about<BR>concepts, and for that reason alone THE BOOK is an all-time<BR>classic.<br />Seeing the MOVIE after reading the book was a HUGE disappointment<BR>for me.  I think that one main reason for this might be that the<BR>book is an epic, and no movie has the time to explore and<BR>elaborate on the characters as much as the book has.  The<BR>second is that many of the dialogues in the movie are directly<BR>taken from the book.  Within the grand scope of the book, this<BR>is appropriate, but taken out of context, the dialogues seem<BR>awkwardly transplanted.  Rand should have written different<BR>dialogues for a short movie.  This book should have been <BR>remade as a TV series ... that allows for the depth of character <BR>development, which is vital to understanding Rand's ideas.<br />Having said all that, I'll say that Gary Cooper is the perfect<BR>fit for Howard Roark.  I was disappointed by the limited <BR>expression that was allowed in the movie for Dominique Francon.<BR>Gail Wynand's depiction as the tragic hero is the one that<BR>seemed to me closest to the book, and Ellsworth Toohey in<BR>the movie was hardly what I expected after reading the book.<BR>The Toohey character in the movie is well-built, and a <BR>fairly imposing person.  The Toohey that I gathered from the book <BR>might have been a frail and odd-looking character, much like<BR>Larry King, who achieves his power based on his personality,<BR>wit, intrigue, and sarcasm.<br />Well, enough talk.  Read the book, you will adore it.  If you've<BR>already read it, don't see this movie.
B000003S09|5.0|Not much that I can really add to the already massive commentary that has been bundled atop this work, yet, just know that this is a pivotal and necessary addition to any music collection. Not only was this album arguably the spear-head to the 'progressive rock' movement, it also was innovative in its approach and accessibility. <BR>   The original line-up of Robert Fripp (guitars), Ian McDonald (woodwinds and keyboards), Greg Lake (vocals and bass), Michael Giles (drums), and lyricist Pete Sinfield only recorded one album together. It could be said that this group was too good to have lasted too long, which unforunately proved to be the case. Mixing elements of rock n' roll, jazz, classical, and folk musics, this was a band that could not possibly be re-produced. <BR>   The album opener &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; is incredibly powerful, energetic, and arguably one of the first heavy metal tunes. Combining the frantic rhythms of rock and the advanced musician-ship of jazz, this song was like a massive burst of energy in the music world: a sort of warning signal that King Crimson has arrived and is taking no prisoners. &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; is very mellow, soft, with acoustic guitars, flute, and drums. &quot;Epitaph&quot; is lengthy, moving, and other two syllable words. Was also one of the first songs to prominantly feature the Mellotron, a keyboard instrument that produces orchestral sounds via a tape looping system. Greg Lake belts out Pete Sinfield's looming lyrics, Fripp holds down a steady acoustic arpeggiated figure, and McDonald keeps the tune moving with the swooshing Mellotron tones.<BR>   &quot;Moonchild&quot; has been called the weakest link in this otherwise impenetrable chain of musical events. While the lyrics may leave a bit to be desired, and the tune does ramble on with sparse improvisational noodling for a good 10 minutes, the song DOES work, and fans of jazz and jam-band rock will be comfortable in this musical setting. <BR>The final track, which is also the title track, is, like &quot;Epitaph&quot;, monstrous, forbodding, heavy, and, like a good classical composition, moves in many diverse orchestral formations. The lyrics are perhaps a bit on the pagan side, with images of Satan, demons, and demented kings and jokers. However, it's all about the music, and the music does what it does, which is no less than great. I particuarly love the way the album ends, with the pipe organ playing a silly melody, leading into a rocking finale which sort of screeches to a halt at the very end. Just like the album, the first line-up also hit with a bang and then, out of nowhere, dissipated. It would be several years before the group, with Robert Fripp leading the helm, would again come into it's own with &quot;Larks Tongue in Aspic&quot;. <BR>  If my review isn't convincing enough, at least listen to a song or two, and see if this music appeals to you. A note concerning the re-mastered issue of a few years ago, I would highly suggest this release. The sound quality, while not leaps and bounds over previous editions (the original master tape has been lost and therefore cannot be used for sonic improvements), it is the best version thus far, with photos, period interviews, and notes from Mr. Fripp.
0385486804|4.0|It's hard to beleave when reading this gripping page turner, that this book is a true story, based on one mans incredible adventure. This is one of the very few books that tells you on the front cover that the main character dies. (Don't worry I'm not giving away the book) Krakour's point was not to focus on McCandlesess death, but his amazing and brave adventure that few would dare to follow.
0792838084|5.0|I really love this movie. David Lynch has always done a great work. David Lynch is my favorite director and I love all of his movies. But this is maybe the best he has ever done. Dennis Hopper plays better then ever. It's always fun to see Jack Nance who has been in almost every Lynch film. He had the leading part Lynch's first movie \\"Eraserhead\\". This movie talks about all the evil in this world and it's really scary. A movie that every filmfan should see.
B000069AUI|4.0|These cd is awesome.  If you loved Parachutes, it's a must get.  Hasn't left my cd player in a week.  Most get five minutes of play :/
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a great album!  Avril has an amazing, smooth, strong voice.  The music itself is wonderful, good guitar riffs and beat.  I like how you can hear each note and beat perfectly without them overpowering her voice, and her voice doesn't overpower the tunes.  Each note, as well as her voice, are powerful on their own, making a great song.  I also like how each song has a different sound, and every time you listen to them, you hear something new and more gripping than before.  I am desperately awaiting her next release!

B000066NW0|5.0|When I got this CD, I'd only heard a couple of songs, and I really wasn't sure whether or not I'd like it.  The last CD I got (Vanessa Carlton's Be Not Nobody) had given me severe disappointment, and at first I was hesitant, but in the end I got it and I haven't regretted it at all.<br />Teenagers like myself can relate to a lot of the songs on here, the two songs I personally relate to well being &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;.  <br />Scores for each song out of five<br />Losing Grip:  5/5: before I got this CD, I'd never heard this song, but it should be right out there on the radio like &quot;Complicated&quot;.  I love this song, by far my favorite on the album.<br />Complicated: 5/5:  What can you say about this song?  Great beat, good lyrics, the song that got me interested in the first place.  Definitely worth listening to.<br />Sk8er Boi:  5/5:  I like this song a lot, and I can always get into it.  It really catches the way that people nowadays act toward each other.  It's about a, well, skater boy who asks out a preppy girl, but she turns him down because he's not her class.  Then, years later, he turns into a rock superstar, and she's left feeling stupid.  Everyday in my school, people descriminate against each other because of looks, so I can really relate.<br />I'm With You: 4/5:  Good song, with a nice, slow melody and pretty words.  Not my very favorite, but as you can tell from the rating, still a good song.<br />Mobile: 2/5: The beat is okay, which is the only reason this song doesn't get a one from me.  I'm sorry to fans of this song, but it just bugs me.<br />Unwanted: 4/5:  A good rock song that's fun to turn up really loud.  Sure, your neighbor's will complain, but it's not your fault they don't appreciate good music. ;-)<br />Tomorrow: 3/5:  Good beat, average lyrics.  At first I didn't like this song but I grew into it.  Still not the best, but worth hearing.<br />Anything But Ordinary: 4/5:  Good song, and lyrics Ican definitely relate to, about living on the edge, and not caring much about boundaries that will just make your life boring.  I can totally understand where this song came from.<br />Things I'll Never Say: 4/5: Another song I didn't really like at first, but I grew into liking.  I don't really know what else to say about this song.<br />My World:  5/5:  I don't know what I expected this song to be like but it was different than what I pictured--in a good way.  It really captures teenagers emotions about things, and I can relate.  Realistic lyrics and great beat.<br />Nobody's Fool: 4/5:  This song is sorta different from the rest of the CD in the way that it's rap, but it's cool rap, and she does this song well.  It's cool.<br />Too Much To Ask: 2/5:  I don't HATE this song, but it's definitely not my favorite.  I just don't really like it.  I don't know why, I just don't.<br />Naked: 2/5: Another iffy song that I don't really care for.<br />Anyway, I would recommend this CD to anyone, teenagers in particular.  Avril's CD rocks, and I look forward to more from her--next time I won't hesitate to buy it.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I own both VHS and DVD versions of this and it is a movie I recommend often.  99% of the time it is returned with enthusiastic appreciation and comments like &quot;I didn't know that about Indian history.  What a story.&quot;  The only criticism I've heard was &quot;it was too long&quot; but it's a big story and I told those friends to invest their time.  They didn't regret it.  Richard Attenborough's direction is outstanding, it is beautifully filmed, and you'd swear Ben Kingsley had a special tie with Gandhi to so portray him so well.  I believe this is an important movie, particularly for people who haven't had time to read about the history of one of the key parts of our world.  The world is a small place and great movies like this serve an important educational role in making us aware of other cultures as well as providing tremendous entertainment. Movie making at it's finest!!
630451087X|4.0|Here we have a really wierd film, were you don't understand anything. But I love it and I love David Lynch. You have to see it a few times to get anything at all, but it's great! We have great actors and a great director. I think I understand this movie and I've seen it three times. But some might never understand this.  It's a great movie and a great brain exercise.
6305897786|5.0|After reading the other reviews of this movie, I just can't believe that these people saw the same movie.  I found this movie to be fantastic and quite well thought out.  I liked it so much that I immediately went out and bought the book, which I found to be even better.  I actually bought several copies of the book and movie to give as gifts.  I was truly shocked to read a negative critique of Emmanuel Seigner's acting.  She was fantastic.  I've not seen many people that can convey so much without speaking hardly a word.  I think to the role of the devil (or whatever incarnate she really was) is hugely challenging, compounded by the fact that this role of the evil one, was supposed to be one that we could fall in love with.  She did a marvelous job.  See the movie, then read the book.
B000069CWE|4.0|Linkin Park is one of my favorite bands, so naturally i reserved a copy of Reanimation and picked up the first day it came out... I have to say that im not too impressed. They really killed some of their songs(especially in the end.) \\"this\\" version of in the end is the stuppidest [thing] ive ever heard. the new lyrics are good but put it this way, if i saw motion man on the street(whoever the [heck] he is) i'd slap across the face for ruining one of my favorite songs. My only other criticism is that in songs such as one step closer, the music goes for too long without singing(1 minute 52 seconds.)And also that there are really only like 1 or 2 new songs, the rest is just 30 second clips of people talking?? Although i think hybrid theory is a much better buy, this is a good cd, and i do reccomend you buy it. Id also like to add that for you worried fans, this isnt their second album, more like a \\"light snack between meals\\" type thing. From what ive heard their second album is due in march 2003. thank you for your time.
B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch crafted one of the most visually haunting films ever imagined in 1986 with Blue Velvet.  Dream like from the beginning, the film starts off simply enough, we see the residents of a small town enjoying themselves, in fact the town is what anyone and everyone would envision as a perfect town community.  Young college student Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, who was also in Lynch's Dune and would later star on Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks) returns to his seemingly perfect town when his father suffers a heart attack (in a very chilling scene).  One day he discovers a severed human ear that is decomposing in a field, and this is when we as the viewers discover that this seemingly perfect little town is hiding some deadly secrets.  Eventually, Jeffrey teams up with a young Laura Dern (who it seems is modeled after a 1950's high school sweet heart) and both begin playing detective, and it soon leads them to a tortured nightclub singer named Dorothy(played by Isabella Rossellini), who has some secrets of her own.  This leads Jeffrey to begin to have a dangerous obsession with Dorothy, and that is not taken too well by Frank (Dennis Hopper, who is extremely great in this completely psycho role), a man who is terrorizing Dorothy for his own sexual perversions, and is holding her child hostage to attain them.  Later on we get to see Frank and his crazed crew (Brad Dourif among them), and we meet his \\"oh so suave\\" buddy Ben (Dean Stockwell), who has only one screen appearence, but it is a chilling one nonetheless.  The only complaint I can think of is how the film ended, it seems to me that Lynch had an alternate ending but decided to go with the one featured here.  Lynch pulls out all the stops here, tugging at every emotion he can.  You'll laugh, cringe, feel sorry for the characters, and be horrified, sometimes all at once.  Blue Velvet is a haunting, dizzying, mind bending trip that will haunt you for days after viewing it, this is Lynch's best film, and it stands today as an American classic.as an American classic.
0316666343|1.0|Awful book.  Ms. Sebold should just quit now.  There is no story line and the ending is god awful.  I am an avid reader and this is the first book in my life that I had to skim through because I could not take the boredom any longer.  Do not waste your time on this embarrassing addition to the bestsellers list.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay had a great album in Parachutes.  That's why it's so unbelievable that A Rush of Blood to the Head is so much better!  This is the only album of a modern band (besides Radiohead) that I can listen all the way through and not feel like they are redoing the same song / style with different lyrics 12 times in a row.  <br />During an interview before the release of In My Place, Chris Martin (lead singer) was asked what their new single was going to be, he replied jokingly \\"Yellow 2.\\"  Well, thank goodness Yellow 2 this is not.  Every song is a masterpiece with its own sound and message.  <br />I've waited a long time for this album, and they did not disappoint me at all.  The only thing that bothers me is that I'm going to have to wait at least another 2 years before I can get more!  Hopefully they will release a live album after this tour!
B00001IVOR|5.0|This album personofies the Wu as we know them, they came to their own on this album and showed the world what their visions were and recorded one of the deepest hip hop albums to date, most of the songs have a deep message to them but it's quite clear.  The 1st Disc is by far and away the best of the two, so I can't agree with the one in Spotlight review who said Disc two is the better.  The first disc is 11 straight Wu bangers and not the wack Black Shampoo and Maria songs you will find on disc two, it is the hard side.  Songs like For Heavens Sake, A Better Tomorrow, Visionz, Severe Punishment, MGM, Reunited, It Yours and a few others bang so hard on the first disc you won't want to switch it.  Disc two has it's spotlights too with Triumph, The City and a few other bangers to keep it from being a wash, the falloff is it is too long 16 as compared to 11 on side one and has too many filler songs, luckily it is saved by the songs I mentioned and a straight heater in the song Heaterz (A classic Wu sampled song with so much energy to it it's crazy).  The seond disc however falls short and could have been merged with the first one to make a classic 15 or 16 song single CD that would have gotten a straight 5 mics in magazines and reviewers alike.  I recommend this one to people who love hip hop with meaning and love lyrics and beats that hit hard as nails, if you are into hip pop and new age stuff you should stay away from this one however because it's over your head, you might find Method Man and the beats entertaining though (Everyones favorite member).  Rza says on the beginning it will take folks till 2000 just to get this, and it seems some still haven't gotten their message or deciphered the importance of this album to date in 02.  I think they should listen again after a few years and feel how much hip hop has fallen off in the last few years and has no purpose anymore, then realize how special this album is.  Pick this up like Rza said and get all the Summer school you need this summer from the 2 disc LP Wu Tang Forever, you won't be dissapointed or have another coaster to put under your beers.  Wu Tang Forever........
B0000560X3|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the all time great rock albums.<BR>The music is lots of fun. \\"Lazy\\" is a nifty jazz influenced piece. It starts with a back and forth interplay between the keyboards and guitars. It has a kind of laid back easy going kind of groove which builds into a straight out rocker. \\"Highway Star,\\" \\"Smoke on the Water\\" (the big hit), and \\"Space Truckin'\\" all have a tight drum beat and bass line anchoring metalic guitar riffs and organ breaks and crisp vocals. Clean, straight forward, hard driving rock - the kind music to listen to barreling down an open stretch of freeway at 90 miles per hour. <BR><BR>Why buy the DVD-Audio? Aggressive, progressive metal needs clarity, warmth and lots of headroom. CDs are dry and edgy sounding. They accentuate the edge in metalic rock and make the music seem harsh and brittle. DVD-A fixes this problem. If you have a DVD system, even just a regular dolby digital system pumped through a stereo, you will be amazingly impressed with the sound quality of this DVD-A. If you have a 5.1 surround system, you will be in the center of the music, much like being present when it was recorded because this album was not recorded in a studio. It was recorded in the hallways of ground floor of the Grand Hotel in Montreaux, Switzerland. The 5.1 surround mix gives back an intimacy which is lacking in a two channel mix. It is like sitting in the hallway with the band as they recorded the album. In addition, the DVD-A significantly improves sound reproduction. The bass is more tangible, the guitar and voices are alive and stunning, and the high end of the drums and cymbals are more lifelike. If you have the CD, you will never want to listen it again. But, you will play the DVD - a lot. A must have album for any rock collection.
6304117302|5.0|It had been a while since I saw the VHS version, so I did not immediately notice the changes made in the DVD.  I did miss the old scenes once I realized their absence, and regardless of the merits of the extra scenes, don't understand why they were removed. I've read mixed reviews about the extra scenes, and I agree that except for the last monologue, they are inconsequential.  I thought the final monologue was quite brilliant, actually.  I believe many of those who disliked Chingachgook's speech may have misinterpreted it.  When he speaks of a time when men like him won't be around, he is not speaking merely as an Indian, but as the rugged, unspoiled men that all of us, regardless of race, are descended from.  He is not talking about the Indian displaced by the White man, but of a certain human character displaced by cars, cell phones, and DVD entertainment systems with surround sound.  I'm not advocating we all destroy our computers and live in Unabomber-style shacks; modern life is, on the whole, great.  But if a strong part of us didn't yearn to be like Chingachgook or Hawkeye, we wouldn't love this movie so much.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should enjoy.  It shows the struggles the wives of these soilders in vietnam go through as well as their struggles on the homefront for the women audiences who want a love story that tugs at the ol' heart strings.  Its shows the men, the soilders on the front lines of battle for the men like myself who want an action packed movie.  This is a perfect date movie, and what is great about this movie is you can practically put yourself in the positon of some of the characters.  You tend to find yourself really identifying with their situation.  Guys if your in the mood for an action packed movie, but your gal wants a romantic tear jerkering flick, We Were Soilders is the perfect compromise!
0790731452|5.0|To see Pam in that belly dancing outfit is the only reason you need to see Mars Attacks. Good flick.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When i first saw these guys, i personally thought they were a really good rock band. i don't consider them a punk band, because not every band that has a guitar player is. but the cd is very well done. its simple, but thats the way rock should be done. i actually think that these guys are so good that they shouldn't be lowered down to be on mtv folling a britney spears video on TRL, followed by what people consider a punk band, Good Charlotte. mtv2 yes, much music yes, but when you hit mtv you become a pop group. and sadly, i have seen them on mtv, but the power of this cd kills people's view of them as a pop group. i recomend people who are thinking of getting it just get it.

6305971099|2.0|The Halloween series was losing it's luster with the release of Halloween 3 which was a terrible mistake. Halloween 4 helped boost the series, but Halloween 5 was too rushed, therefore pushing the series down again.<br />Halloween 5 picks up immediately where part 4 ended: After desperate attempts to kill his niece, Jaime Lloyd, Haddonfield police opened fire on Myers, sending him flying into an abandoned mind shaft followed by a stick of dynamite. Halloween 5 starts immediately after the explosion. Michael makes his way out of the mind shaft and into a stream barely escaping the explosion.<br />It is a smooth transition between the two films, but you'll notice a difference in the new mask. The mask Myers dons in this film is completely rediculous and so far from the original that you'll shake your head in shame. Myers continues to float downstream until he ends up at an older man's house, or shack rather, and passes out and is in a coma for a year. The man takes care of him until Halloween arrives. The shape awakens, and disposes of him, and sets out to once again track down his neice, who has been admitted to a children's mental clinic due to the tramas (one of which... losing her voice) she has suffered from Michael.<br />What I thought was cheesey is how little Jaime all of the sudden aqquired a sixth sense if you will. She can feel Michael Myers and knows his every move and location. This entry in the series also introduces you to a new character. A shadowy man dressed in black, always lurking around whenever Myers causes mayhem. While interesting, you don't really find out who, or what he is until Halloween 6 (The Curse Of Michael Myers).<br />Another downfall of this film is the terrible characters. While always positive, Loomis returns yet again adding his own atmosphere to the film. The other characters however, are too few, and very one dimensional.<br />I was really disapointed and bored with this film. The deathcount is really low, and the deaths that are in this film are very non creative. The film, in my opinion, doesn't really start to pick up and build momentum until the last half hour or so of the film, where Loomis and Jaime decide to lore Michael Myers into his house (which is now a mansion. What the hell were they thinking?!) so they can capture/kill him. I thought this sequence was excellent.<br />This DVD does treat you with some nice special features, which is nice. You'll be treated to some theatrical trailers as well as an inside look at the making of the film.<br />I wouldn't recommend this installment of the series to newcomers, and alot of Halloween fans will be disapointed.<br />DVD SCORES<BR>Video - 3/5<BR>Audio 4/5<BR>Special Features - 3/5
0441009425|4.0|Great read.  Alastair Reynolds submits his first space opera for your perusal.  Reynolds fulfills the needs of space opera junkies by building a universe with lighthugging starships, cyberviruses, and characters that are, well, dealing with it all.  This novel is all about addressing the Fermi Paradox.  If you don't know what that is then you probably won't like the book -- then again, just do a Google search, because you will like the book.<br />The characters feel real, the technology is plausible and I can feel the influences of Vernor Vinge, Frank Herbert, Peter Hamilton, and even Neal Stephenson.  Wow - that's a tall crowd.<br />I have only one nit about this novel - Reynolds jumps between innumerable subplots at the beginning - sometimes in with what seems like microsecond duration.  Very hard to follow, but in the end he ties it all up with a bow.  All in all, this book is a must for anyone wanting to see what a space opera written in 2002 looks like.  The sequel, Chasm City reads like a great encore too.<br />Thanks Alastair -- you surpassed my expectations!
B00005LQ04|4.0|Much like Lucio Fulci's \\"The Beyond\\", one must be sure to go into watching this movie with no illusions that it will be a great film, for it is not.  The acting is gratingly bad and the violent sequences of the movie seem almost randomly displaced throughout the film at times.  Its stupid.  But the script is not what draws one to a Dario Argento movie.  No, it is Argento's directing flair and sense for framing scenes that makes his films special.  Suspiria takes full advantage of the concept of using film as an art form and not just mindless entertainment.  I mean, it IS mindless, but when you can look beyond that and just marvel at how beautifully done this film is, shot for shot... even mute the film if you have to... you can really begin to appreciate it.
B000066NW0|3.0|first off, as much as i love the new wave of singer-songwriters,<BR>avril lavigne is not to be compare with the lilith era. i've read them comparing her to alanis, my favourite girl, and she is so so far from alanis. avril lacks alanis' lyrical bombardment, her lack of rawness, her lack of honesty. i'm canadian and i hate when they compare her to anyone else canadian just because they're mildly related by country.<br />someone else compared this debut to fiona apple's, another one of my favourite girls, she is not fiona and this cd has nothing to do with the debut tidal. tidal was a classic cd and it broke so much ground and became another harbinger for female singer-songwriters. all the things avril lacks in comparison to alanis, she too lack the same when juxtaposed to fiona.<br />avril is a great artist, and she outshines many of her other competitors, britney and the like, but there has been no successor to the ongoing beauty of the older generation.<br />alanis, fiona, tori, sarah mclachlan, they are the ongoing torchbearers of artisitc music, and comparing avril to any of them is completely unjustified, though unfortunately inevitable.<br />avril still has not garnered the wisdom that comes with experience.
B000063V8U|5.0|The best season of Trek was, by far, the sixth.  IT has the second half of Time's Arrow, which is an episode that scored an Emmy for the Next Generation series.  It has two two-part episodes, one of which is Chain of Command, which is not only a well-acted episode involving Cardassian brutality, but also quite subversive.  Tapestry was, easily, one of the greatest episodes to involve Q.  Rascals was a memorable episode in which some of the crew gets turned back into children via a transporter accident.  And after all of this, it ends with Descent!  A Star Trek version of World War II that uses Lore as Hitler, and Data as a sort of Mussolini with a cluster of renegade \\"free-thinking\\" borg under their command.  If you save your money for just one TNG gift set, make it this one!
6305907145|5.0|Well, this movie, while not exactly like the book, does capture the essence of what I think Jane Austen wanted to convey.  I've read all of her books and there is always a little bit of cynicism and satire of the upper class society in them.  I think Fanny was well portrayed, though not entirely as like she was in the book.  I do think that it was a good move on the part of the screen writer to make her more confident as she matured though, that is usually how most people are anyway.  Bertram was portrayed rather well, as were most of the characters.  I think that a little more time should have been spent on Edward though, he was, after all, the love of Fanny's life.<br />As a portrayal of life at that time, I found it to be excellent.  It brought up many points in history that were issues at the time.<br />Overall, I'd have to say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone who loves Jane Austen.  One must be forgiving to screen writers when it comes to turning a book into a movie.  Some plots are just too intricate.  I think as long as the essence of what the author was trying to express is there, there's no harm is taking creative license.
1563890410|5.0|When I first read the book years ago I was completely blown away with the way things panned out in this chapter of the entire sandman series. this is really the chapter that basically set everything else up, gets everything moving.<br />I think its fantastic when stories are written because there's a story to be told, and the storyteller already knows there is going to be an ending in sight. The entire sandman series is just that, and not just some needless need for the publisher and the author to make more money with the next chapter. <br />That said, i think on its own A Season of Mists has bears little meaning and consequence, beautiful as it is. But taken into context of the entire series, this is a personal favourite.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit I never heard of Coldplay until recently when I saw them on a late-night viewing of MTV2.  Then this past weekend, I was actually able to buy a copy of this album before it was officially released in North America.  Don't know how this store got copies of it, but I'm glad they did.  I could not believe what I heard.<br />Coldplay is the first band in years that has given me hope that rock 'n roll isn't dead.  In this age of boy bands, hip-hop and rock/hip-hop hybrids, nothing has excited me more about music than Coldplay and this album.  The freshness of their music is the key; reminds me of when Oasis first came onto the scene.  Incredible lyrics, and incredible musical arrangements.<br />I would highly recommend this masterpiece.  &quot;God Put A Smile On Your Face&quot; was the song I heard on MTV2 and I immediately became hooked to this band's music.  My other favorite tracks on this album are &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot;, as well as &quot;In My Place&quot;.  Heck, I enjoy every track.  It's not often that I buy an album where I thoroughly enjoy every single song on it.<br />Great job guys.  Now it's time for me to go out and get their first album Parachutes.
6303407188|5.0|For those who are fond of Grade Z movies, ED WOOD strikes a remarkably resonant note.  Director Tim Burton daringly takes the life of one of the worst directors of all time and somehow makes it interesting.  The real life Ed Wood was convinced of his own directorial talent and each of his wretched cinematic excesses reflect a highly charged but extraordinarily misplaced energy.  Wood's personal life was not unlike the frenetic scenes that he liked to place in front of the camera.  Wood believed that most people were as quirkily odd as he was.  In fact, his oddness became the norm of his films.  Johnny Depp as Ed Wood is convincing as a man whose cinematic vision was obvious only to himself. When things go wrong with his productions, Depp rolls his eyes in the creepy way that would make Michael Moriarity proud and schemes his way to the next step.  Depp's interpretation of Wood's monomania for getting the scene filmed in one take captures the inner essence of a man whose own life was run on the same basis.  Whatever Wood wanted done was done on the fly.  If Wood had a genius it was not the genius of presenting his own distorted vision on the screen but rather the less obvious but equally necessary talent of letting nothing interrupt his directing.  Burton gets some cheap laughs by focusing on Wood's cross-dressing, but the real humor lies in Woods' ability to get his backers to laugh while he convinces them to bankroll his various film projects.  Depp is surrounded by terrific supporting help.  Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi deservedly won an academy award for supporting actor.  The scene in which Depp and Landau reminisce about Lugosi's previous triumphs on screen are both touching and powerful.  As Landau speaks, he reaches out with his scrawny fingers in a come hither way that eerily brings to mind Lugosi's penchant for attracting his next victim.   Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker are also effective.  Each of the real life screen characters was flawed, in somecases, massively so.  What makes ED WOOD the superb movie that it is, is Burton's own loving penchant for presenting people who can succeed on their own terms, despite a society that seems determined to thwart their every move.
0790729628|4.0|This release of Blade Runner was much better than the previous one. Its only problem is a lack of an ending, even a (bad) one. This movie just cuts off. However, the rest of it is insanely good. Fans of Anime will also like this one.
B000069AUI|5.0|Worth the wait.  Once again Coldplay hits the spot with another great sounding album. They have great lyrics too. If you want something different, give this a listen.
B00006FXB6|4.0|I became a QOTSA fan through Rated R which is a strong album from start to finish and really laid the groundwork for Songs for the Deaf.  Next to SOAD, QOTSA are making some of the best, most melodic and thought provoking hard rock music in years.  To call them \\"heavy\\" or \\"metal\\" is dismissive.  QOTSA beat you into submission with meanacing, dirges and hooks that make you want to jump around whether you are walking down the street or sitting at your desk at work.  There really isn't anything as overtly accessible as \\"the lost art of keeping a secret\\" from Rated R, which makes for a more enjoyable listen.  The band is hard and aggressive from the get go, and don't let song titles like \\"Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"Another Love Song\\" fool you, these tracks bludgeon you just as unmercifully as the others.  And in case anyone heard these tracks online and thought they wouldn't need to buy the disc, you get a DVD with the CD?  Talk about a ton of great music for the buck.

0316666343|4.0|When I first started reading this book (after waiting 2 months for it at my local library), I thought it might end up being one of the best books I've ever read. Towards the end, however, it got just too sentimental for my taste. I was hoping that there would be more on the investagation aspect of the crime for one thing. I liked the characters a lot and thought they were well-developed despite what some reviewers have said. In my opinion the writer should have ended the story with the safe being found (this should have been the lovely bones), maybe by Ruth at the sink hole and catching the killer so that the father would have been proven right. It would have made the bones a &quot;lovely&quot; closure. Susie should have never come back down to inhabit Ruth's body. It would have been better to have had Susie keep her beautiful memory of her time with Ray as it actually happened in real life. I especially liked the interesting relationship between Jack and Abigail. I can relate to some of that. The grandmother character was a nice addition too. The only part that made me get teary was when Jack wrapped the sheets around Buckley. I really lost it. All in all, I enjoyed it very much but was disappointed by the ending. Too sappy!

B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;in an Interstellar burst/im back to save universe&quot;<br />The feeling you get when you listen to opening of this album is that you're riding high at leavel with clouds on a Fighter jet ascending into the sun in a heroric clash of guitar and sychronized rythems give the complete feeling elevation into an endless horizon. That is how we begin to journey into OK Computer... an album that is truly the second best if not arguably the best rock album of 90's competing only with Nirvana's Nevermind.<br />Nirvana opened the door as Radiohead was being ushered in at the begining of what was being called &quot;Alternative&quot; Rock. The glimmer of what was preview with the emotional post classic guitar rock of the Bends was just a spark of what mission OKC accomplished. Yorkes vocals soar into the vast fields of Johny, Collin and Ed's amazing guitar work. What makes this album spectacular is its effortless polish and appeal.  <BR>  The story is quite simple. The struggle to find emotion in a technologically changing world where you cant keep pace with the figure ahead which is yourself. &quot;paranoid Android&quot; is a classic six minute, three piece theatrical  urban hym about a night that one cant forget and self loathing in the face of low esteam. Nifty thing about this album is that you dont have to read into it. You can sit and enjoy the overt sounds and structures. &quot;lrt Down&quot; is a U2-ish arena rock mid-tempo smome what ballad with the beautiful lyrics &quot;One day i am gonna grow wings&quot; and yes he does. This Album is the perfect introduction to this sometimes far too intelligent band. Who never repeat themselves and dare us to take the leap them to each new plane they conqure and claim.Thsi album will give you the feeling of discovering Led Zeplin's Stairway to heaven and watching a candle burn. Makes you want to shout again &quot;God bless rock!&quot;<br />Beware of the next step though! radiohead can be tricky little bastards at time. The follow up will leave you bewildered.<BR>But you have to love them anyway! God bless Radiohead!<BR>This album defines them as the saviours of creative rock.

B00000JPHD|5.0|Many different versions of Dracula have come and gone over the years, but the 1931 classic still stands out as the definitive vampire movie. This movie not only brings the story of Dracula to life, but also captures many chilling moments that will keep horror fans coming back for more.  Bela Lugosi stars as Dracula, creating the classic look that has been associated with vampires ever since. But even though Lugosi did a wonderful job portraying Dracula and speaking his many memorable lines, it is Renfield (Dwight Frye) who really brings this movie to life. His maniacal laugh and haunting stare are associated with renfield to this day. And just when the pace of the movie begins to slow down, Renfield returns with his torment between being Dracula's servant and trying to save Mina's life. Incredible scenes such as Renfield pleading for his life as Dracula slowly advances, assure that this classic movie will always have a place in history.
B00000IQC8|5.0|After seeing all of Kevin Smith's other movies, Clerks was the last one I saw. And I admit, I thought that it would be pretty outdated and probably not AS funny as his other movies (especially the humor from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, his latest and last of his Jersey Trilogy) mainly on the purpose that it's black and white, and seems old and all...but I was wrong. Clerks stands out as one of the funniest comedies available still today, and Kevin Smith's humor hasn't changed a bit, just evolved. Clerks is best compared with \\"Office Space\\" by Mike Judge (the guy who created Beavis and Butt-Head) for it's accuracy for portraying working employees. We follow Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran, who's also in many of Kevin Smith's other movies) and his day at the convience store as a clerk working on his day off. And there's Randal Graves, his next door working buddy who constantly shows up next to Dante behind the couter and they both pursue the meaning of life and more. And of course right around the corner we have Jay and Silent Bob, a couple of known drug dealers who constantly show up here and there in this flick, but more limited than in other Kevin Smith movies (for those who love the two heroic icons). <BR>Clerks is a simple, insanely low-budget comedy that focuses on something that we all look for in a movie: smart dialogue. The way that Kevin Smith writes the dialogue in between his characters are pure original and genious, and Clerks is no exception. <BR>So if you are looking for a graphically enhanced and special-effects filled flick, turn away from Clerks as far as you can, but if you like a good movie with excellent dialogue (although filled with extreme profanity and humor), Clerks is an ideal choice. It's a slacker and funny comedy.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This movie left me with MANY questions. First of all, if the moon accident is what caused all these terrible things why wouldn't the guy go back and save the moon instead of fighting super strong monsters? Second, the movie starts out in a time when the first car has been invented. They don't even have TVs. Yet this guy can make a time machine??? It would have made more sense to put him in a more present time. Third, why does he stop in a time period with monsters?????? He goes into the future and they have all these neat things. Glass panels with a guy living in them who knows all the information in the world! Why would he leave that? He goes further into the future and gets to a time where there's monsters who eat people everywhere and says \\"hmmm...I think I'll stay here.\\" What a moron! ANYWAY...I loved this movie despite all the frustrations. The special effects are wonderful. I loved the white leader of the monsters. He was the best part of the movie. It also made me wonder why the guy attacked him even when he was letting him go back in time. If an extremely powerful monster who eats people wants to let me go I'm gonna get ... out of there. Not stick around to fight him. Oh well. I guess you're not supposed to think about these things in a movie like this.
B00005YUR1|5.0|Peggy Sue got Married, is a great movie, as long as you take it for what it is. It's not a heavy movie, but's it well though out, smart, charming and a pleasure to watch. I loved it, and I think Kathleen Turner was rad* I would love to go throughhigh school as peggy Sue re-lived it.
B000063TNH|5.0|In 2000, Steven Soderbergh, already on a roll with 1998's 'Out of Sight' and 1999's 'The Limey,' made an astounding one-two punch in a year of otherwise lackluster Hollywood filmmaking with 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic.' Indeed, the latter won him the Oscar for Best Director and the film itself was widely recognized as one of (if not the) best film of the year. Indeed, Soderbergh famously went out on several limbs making it -- not only was the multi-threaded Drug War storyline a major hot potato in Hollywood (USA Films literally came in at the last minute with the money needed for principle photography after virtually every other studio passed), Soderbergh served as his own cinematographer, utilizing complex and experimental techniques while shooting on mutiple locations, including the San Diego/Tijuana international border (and this particular reviewer's home town of Columbus, Ohio).<br />And as any DVD fanatic can tell you, the story BEHIND the movie is often just as interesting as the movie itself. Yet the film's intial DVD release was, shall we say, a bit of a bad trip.<br />Fortunately Criterion, on its own roll with its series of bells-and-whistles DVDs of the cinema's best (and, at times, most obscure), has given the film its justly deserved double-disc royal treatment.<br />What's new? For starters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Steven Gaghan are finally on hand with a fascinating and surprisingly frank commentary track. At one point, they even admit that practically every criticism leveled at the film -- Catherine Zeta-Jones' character shift from pampered softie to hardened drug dealer is too abrupt; its take on the drug war is too one-sided; some of the plot twists are too forced; in adapting the British television mini-series 'Traffik' for the big screen, Gaghan truncates too much of the original storylines and gives the subject matter the short shrift -- were all things they also worried about during the course of making the film but felt were unavoidable. (Indeed, Zeta-Jones should especially thrill to this new DVD: all the scenes with her that were cut for the theatrical release, including an extended sequence involving her detainment by U.S. Customs, are included in the extensive deleted scenes content.)<br />Meanwhile, budding \\"DPs\\" will enjoy a tutorial of sorts on how Soderbergh achieved the grainy, bleached-out look of the Mexico sequences, while political junkies will drool over a multi-angled look at the outtakes from the Michael Douglas party scene. <br />All-in-all, your appreciation for the movie's sprawling-yet-intimate interweaving storylines; the measured, ensemble-friendly performances; Soderbergh's knack for suffusing every scene he films with a crackling intelligence; and his hermetic respect for his characters and his audience will only increase with this DVD.
B00000255X|5.0|As Blood on the Tracks was so sad bc of its reflection on the turbulation of Dylan's personal love life, &lt;&lt;Desire&gt;&gt; was partly bittersweet. For the reason that he had by now started to say good-bye..to his muse, to anger, to inner turmoil, even though it's not as good as &lt;Tracks&gt;...so we're happy and sad for him.<BR> However Emmylou Harris is a good feminine reassurance to his voice, they complement each other well. Although, surprisingly enough, there are times when Dylan sings SO well that he does a better job than she does. Listen to &quot;Oh, Sister&quot; again. Yes, he is definitely at his vocal BEST on this album. (Though &lt;Blood on the Tracks&gt;has my fave voice-it is partly bc that voice is fragile and a bit &quot;wobbly&quot;. But in &lt;&lt;Desire&gt;&gt; Dylan's voice is its strongest, and just b4 cigarettes started doing his larynx a disservice. ) In &quot;One More Cup..&quot; he practically sings like an Arabian prince and brings tears to my eyes. And NOBODY could sing &quot;Hurricane&quot; or &quot;Isis&quot; as well as he can. Not only because of the &quot;Dylanesque quirks&quot; of his, but because of the emotional strength of his voice and timbre.
B000066NW0|5.0|I beleieve that Avril is the great discovery of this year because she combines a great voice, honest lyrics written by herself, and a cd that includes 12 great songs, showing us that she can really sing and be herself. I first listened to her on MTV and I thought that if the cd is as good as his hit single Complicated, we were going to have a new and really fresh artist, who´s true to herself. i love eery song on the record, but my favourites are...<BR>ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY<BR>COMPLICATED<BR>MOBILE<br />NOBODY´S FOOL<BR>I´m 25 years old and I can relate to the things she says in her songs, even though I´m not a teenager anymore. I look forward to whatever she does in the future,  I think she has a very bright one.
B00006AW2G|4.0|WOW - You hear subtle sounds (and not so subtle sounds) never heard on any previous release of this album, and that is just listening to it in the car.  At home on an SACD player, the depth, sound staging and clarity are fantastic.  Keith's guitar tone takes on a new meaning of raw.  The percussion has all kinds of little nuances.  Want a real treat?  Go ahead and turn the balance all the way to the left in YCAGWYW and listen to the french horn &amp; Mick's vocals.  Add to it the fact that this is one of the Stones finest studio albums ever, and it is a real winner.  Go buy it today!<br />The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because of the packaging.  For a release of this caliber, the copy I have is using cardboard instead of the jewel case.  Do you want more information in the liner notes?  Well forget it.  The only information printed is what was originaly on the inner sleave of the LP.  Come on, not even an original release date?<br />For a project of this magnitude, releasing so many Stones albums remastered and on SACD, why didn't they do a little better job here.
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard Coldplay early last year, playing on a radio station in Chicago. It was love at first hearing. I rushed to a store and bough Parachutes. After that I had a chance to buy their import singles and get many great songs that were not in their debut album.<br />Yesterday I hada a chance to buy, here in Brazil, their follow-up, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I've been listening to it since them and all I can say is that it is even better than Parachutes. It reminds a lot of those melancholic 80's Echo and the Bunnymen songs, sometimes reminds of a Pink Floyd/Radiohead mix, but you never forget that this is a Coldplay album.<BR>I do hope they last long enough to give us pearls like their 2 albums and never try something too weird or different, because they are simply magnificent.<br />If you've ever heard \\"Yellow\\", \\"Trouble\\" or \\"In my Place\\", do yourself a favour and buy this one. You'll be pleased and amazed.
0393038912|5.0|Diamond argues persuasively and backs up his arguments thoroughly - almost too thoroughly.  My only complaint about the book is that it perhaps gets a bit too repetitive; as he applies his theory to example after example you reach the point where you can predict what he's going to say for the next 10 pages or so.
B000069HKH|5.0|I've been a big fan of Springsteen ever since the original Time and Newsweek covers.  This, in my mind, is the best complete work by the man since &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.  While there have been flashes of brilliance since, then, I think this one is going to stand out as one of his top three works, if not his best.<br />We have all been inundated by media contributions on 9/11.  The worst are the commercial ventures that basically say &quot;United we stand, now buy our product.&quot;   With songs from entertainers, while most (but not all) have been heartfelt, they have ranged from decent, to, I'm sorry to say, quite awful. <br />For someone to take on an entire album to reflect on the tragedy was an awesome task.  To do it without one false-sounding note is astonishing.  I can't think of anyone else who could have come close to the task and succeed nearly this well.  Bob Dylan would have probably done it up too obscure.  Maybe Tom Petty.  No, it's Bruce Springsteen who can connect to Everyman better than anyone in the biz.  I'm glad he rolled up his sleeves, dusted the mothballs off his band, and put out the work he was born for.<br />There are those that complain this either sounds too much like Bruce, or not like him at all.  How do you win in this situation?  Yes, it's Springsteen, but which album is supposed to sound like him?  &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park&quot; is not &quot;Born to Run&quot; is not &quot;Nebraska&quot;.  Yes, there is familiarity there.  There are the rockers, but I particularly like how &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot; finally takes us back to that magical world of &quot;The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle&quot;.  On the other hand, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; literally takes you to the other side of the world.  The man is still growing while still being himself.  <br />I think we have that rare work here that's going to be a commercial and critical success.  I think it will be a big prescence at the next Grammy awards.  And I think it will take it's place as a classic.
B00004Z459|4.0|Though Linkin Park's debut Hybrid Theory was first unnoticed when in first came out in October 2000, it grew to become 2001's top selling album and the band's first single, In the End, went on to become one of the most played radio tracks of the year.  But what made this band so fantastic?  Was it their hating well-though up vocals, their heavy and perfect guitar riffs, or perhaps just the head-banging hard rock sound?  Every one of those reasons contribute as to why this is one of the top ten rock bands in the last half-decade.  Linkin Park is not very original, providing songs that sound a lot like other rock bands on the market today.  However, what separates them from all other bands are the two singers:  Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda.  While Bennington provides the band with his screaming angry vocals, Shinoda adds in a bit of hip-hop/rap all resulting in a perfect song.  Every song has these elements making this a must-buy album for all music fans.  However, not everything can be excellent.  It's time to separate the good from the bad:<br />1. Papercut - 4/5. How to explain this song?  You love it the first time you hear it, then after ten listens it gets boring.  Catchy vocals and good rap pieces by Mike Shinoda.  A very haunting melody about paranoia and its side effects.  Length of song: 3:05. <br />2. One Step Closer - 6/5. Incredibly catchy song. Hands down, the best song of the album.  I've listened to at least forty times and it never once failed to entertain me.  Great catchy chorus but it's only Bennington in this one.  The only problem is it's way too short.  Length of song: 2:36.<br />3. With You 3/5. Good though gets boring after several listens. <BR>Not a very catchy chorus and probably one that you won't enjoy for very long.  Listen to it twice.  If you like it, enjoy.  Otherwise, press the Skip button.  Length of song: 3:24.<br />4. Points of Authority 4/5. My friends say this is their favorite song but I think there's nothing special about it. Chorus is catchy with some good guitar riffs but nothing really special when compared to other songs.  Length of Song: 3:20.<br />5. Crawling 5/5.  The second best song on the album with Mike Shinoda playing guitar and providing several short parts.  A really catchy song but no match when compared to the greatness of One Step Closer.  Length of Song: 3:29.<br />6. Runaway 4/5. Not bad, not excellent. It's just good. A song about someone escaping from someone and witnessing the outside world.  Good chorus but again nothing when compared to other songs.  Length of Song: 3:03.<br />7. By Myself - 3 1/2 /5. Good song and chorus.  Catchy and does not get boring even after about ten listens.  I've grown to like this song. Goes from fast rock to slow and not all bands can do that.  Mike Shinoda overpowers Bennington in this song.  He has mainly all the parts.  Length of Song: 3:09.<br />8. In the End - 5/5. This is the 3rd best song on the album. It would have got second but I think it was too overplayed so got a bit boring.  This song totally belongs to Mike Shinoda who sings more than Chester in this song.  Very haunting and catchy lyrics with a lot of creepy piano playing.  Length of Song: 3:36<br />9. A Place For My Head -2/5. The worst song on the album. Chorus is not at all catchy and lyrics are a bit weird and first verse is not understable.  The last verse is good, though.  Not the worst song I'm ever heard but definetely worst on the album.  Length of Song: 3:04.<br />10. Forgotten - 4/5. Great song. Good rapping my Mike Shinoda in this one though kind of sounds like a Limp Bizkit type of song.  A bad beginning which jumps out right at you  but the whole song eventually makes up for it.  Not the best chorus, though. Probably fourth best on the album.   Length of Song: 3:14.<br />11. Cure For The Itch - 3/5. Just the disk-jockey Joseph Hahn doing this one. A stupid skit in the beginning followed by a scary piano piece.  Not the best song definetely though itbeats Place For My Head.  Very creepy.  Length of Song:  2:31<br />12. Pushing Me Away -3/5. Great way to end an album with some good guitar riffs.   First time you finish the song and the album, you'll be thinking: Wow, can this really be over?  Okay chorus but pretty grabbing.  Length of song: 3:05.<br />Hybrid Theory is a great album, backed with two great guitarists and vocalists, an exceptional drummer, and a good DJ.  This is the album which Reanimation (Linkin Park's remix CD) was based on though after such a fantastic CD, Reanimation was a bit of a let down.  Another bad part about the album are the song's lengths.  While songs like In the End cross the 3:30 line, there is only about two minutes and fifty-five seconds of actual singing.  Other songs that are 1/6 made out of guitars and drums only include Runaway and One Step Closer (Such a great song and only two minutes and sixteen seconds of singing).<br />Can't wait for the next album.  Hope it includes My December and High Voltage since those are only available on the imports.  A defying album that breaks all the rules of rock.  Simply excellent.  <br />Music Type: Rock<BR>Band: Linkin Park<BR>Total Length of CD: 37:50.
B000066AXC|5.0|There are some problems with seeing a movie for the first time a few months after it's release.  You read reviews and the side articles, and an image appears in your mind as to what you are about to see even before you see it.  You read how much of the movie is fiction.  You read (and read and read) articles about how Russell Crowe is such a jerk.  And then you actually see the movie.  <br />With all the above baggage, there is added about halfway through the film a turn that throws you for a loop.  Not exactly the same way as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot;, but the same in the sense that you are jolted into rethinking what you have been shown.  Unlike those other two movies, where the shockers are at the end, and it explains everything, in this movie, it appears in the middle.  You now have the rest of the movie to decide if you've been cheated.  Without revealing anything, I'll say, like the other two movies, all the clues are there if you've paid attention. <br />So I liked it for that, and I liked it for the performances.  I didn't like Russell Crowe in &quot;Gladiator&quot; because he was too much of a superman.  But in this one you get to see a performance of a character who probably thinks he is the smartest person in the world, and therefore somehow evolutionarily above just about everyone else.  To see some humbleness being introduced when this crumbles is done very well.  When he regains his prestige, however, he descends into another kind of hell, and it's not so much the descent as the recovery that is heartwarming.  Once again, he finds he has to interact with other humans to truly find happiness.<br />There is also a great supporting cast, especially Jennifer Connelly.  During the first part of the movie, there is nothing special there, but as Crowe's illness reaches dangerous levels, how she takes over is work that deserves the Oscar she got.  Considering she has to interact with someone who most of the time would prefer not tointeract with anyone, how she finally gets into his world helps make the movie a joy to watch.
B000002H97|3.0|Back in 1992, when I was just a wee lad of 13, the Black Album was, as I'm sure it was for many others, my introduction to metal.  And through most of the 1990's, Metallica was the only metal band I ever really bothered to listen to.  But after buying \\"S & M\\" upon its release and gaining my first exposure to songs from \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets,\\" I decided to explore Metallica's 1980's catalogue and the floodgates were opened.  I now listen almost exclusively to metal, and I enjoy pretty much any style lf metal you can think of, and I must say that for all its commercial success the Black Album is far from the pinnacle of the metal genre, or even of Metallica's career.<br />The Black Album was, of course, the album that garnered Metallica massive record sales and radio and MTV exposure.  And it's easy to see why: the songs on this album are shorter, simpler, less heavy, less lyrically oppressive, and typically slower than on previous outings.  Of course, many (myself included) would say that this isn't necessarily a good thing.  While I don't want to get into the whole \\"sellout\\" debate, that's sort of beside the point.  What is the point is that what's good for the radio is not good for the serious metal fan.  By streamlining their sound, Metallica lost a great deal of what had made them so compelling in the first place.<br />That's not to say there aren't good points(I did give three stars, after all).  Although not as ambitious as previous efforts, this is still a pretty heavy album. There are some excellent riffs and solid solos, and James's vocals are in fine form.  Songs like \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"Enter Sandman,\\" and \\"The God that Failed\\" even had some of the bite of Metallica's older work; \\"Sad But True,\\" in particular remains one of my favorite Metallica songs.  But really, did any of Metallica's '80's albums contain so many mediocre songs like \\"The Unforgiven,\\" \\"My Friend of Misery,\\" and \\"Through the Never\\"?  Nothing on here is really definable as bad, but there's way too much that's just forgettable.<br />Now, this certainly isn't a bad album to have.  It's a good pickup for those who are new to the metal genre, as I was a decade ago.  Still, I think the black album's main value is as a stepping stone on the way to bigger and better things.  Now (shameless plug coming up), I would feel remiss if I didn't mention some of these bigger and better things in this space, so here goes: '80's Metallica (duh), Megadeth, Anthrax, Morbid Angel, Death, Amon Amarth, The Crown, Opeth, Testament, Emperor, and the Forsaken.  This is just a short list though; there's a lot more out there for those who are willing to look.as bad, but there's way too much that's just forgettable.  <br />Now, this certainly isn't a bad album to have.

B00006FXB6|4.0|First of all, I'll stake it right here and say Songs for the Deaf is, overall, a better disc than Rated R, and certainly the self-titled debut. However, that's looking at the complete package. They best songs on Rated R are hands down better than any of the tunes on Songs for the Deaf, in terms of pop sensibility and out and out quirkiness. But having got an advance copy of Songs some weeks back, I can honestly say that the new disc is far more enjoyable, especially when driving around town. This is really about the heaviest disc out there. And the fact that Homme, Oliveri and Co. can combine that heaviness with catchy hooks without going the bubblegum pop route of Blink 182 or the sodomized by my uncle rap rants of KoRN is a testiment to their songwriting skills. As for sheer rock star firepower, this disc can't be beat: you've got not one, not two, but three, singers. And then there's some guy from some Seattle outfit on drums. Stand out tracks: Millionaire, No One Knows, The Misquito Song, Another Love Song. For those who've been with Homme and Oliveri since Kyuss, you'll certainly appreciate Songs for the Deaf. Like I said, this disk is heavier than the thoughts of God and deeper down than a one way trip to the womb of Mother Earth.
B00000DLUV|4.0|While most of the music I listen to has a much \\"harder\\" edge<BR>(guitar-oriented rock) I have always respected The Bee Gees for their staying power in a very fickle industry.<br />Much to the consternation of my Led Zeppelin peers, this CD was enjoyable over and beyond my expectations.<br />I found it fitting that I discovered it five years after its release, right on the brink of the 25th anniversary of the movie \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", which will be released for the first time on DVD this fall. Six of the tunes from the all-time best selling soundtrack are included here. IF YOU THINK THEY HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO THE STUDIO VERSIONS, YOU ARE IN FOR THE SURPRISE OF YOUR LIFE.........THEY R-O-C-K!!! The live versions are infused with a passion, spirit and energy over and beyond the originals, and also benefit from the new technology. HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE remains the finest ballad of the disco era. Every time I hear it, it stays in my head and I hum it for days on end. So it was a joy to hear it reprised (also check out their \\"unplugged\\" version on the VH1 STORYTELLERS CD). And of course with the proper chords! How many cover versions have I heard where those imposters get the chords wrong and wreck it.....CRIMINAL!!<br />Also it brought back fond memories of the songs I first heard on AM radio when they began, like LONELY DAYS.<br />The Bee Gees are timeless and unique, which reserves them a mark in popular music history. Good music done tastefully. They single-handedly revived the disco era, which was ready to fold from such weak efforts like DISCO DUCK and DO THE HUSTLE. And although disco endured another two or three years,the music that followed after SNF was characterized by an incessant and annoying throbbing bass line that could make one deaf or insane. The Bee Gees output was more benign and of course the songs were superior in their craftmanship.<br />BUY THIS CD AND LOVE IT!!
B00004T37H|5.0|Princess Monoke was and is one of the best animes that isn't a saga. I am fan of lots of anime and most are continus epsiodes but this was definitly one of the best over them all I've seen recently. You could easly compare this one with Akira as being a influental anime of the year. It has made most anime directors re think the way their going to make their anime. The storyline and setting are awsome and it flows extremely well so you won't ever want to leave the screen. The ending was excellent making you want to see more. Its simply put the best anime of this year. See it. Love it. It will change the way you see anime.
6304140711|4.0|Hey,<br />I can't exactly remember when i first saw this movie! Could of been with friends who knows! but its one of my favorite &quot;thrillers&quot;! To start things Mark Wahlberg plays David(and the appeal to most is Mark is very good looking especially in this movie)- I don't want to give away this movie but basically he meets Nicole(Reese Witherspoon) and things don't turn out the way Nicole plans.. The reason why i enjoyed this movie so much and had to buy it was because of how suspenceful it gets! It actually has somewhat of a plot unlike many other &quot;teen&quot; thriller movies.. so i recommend you check this movie out:) you won't be dissapointed!
B000069AUI|5.0|After their wonderful first album, 'Parachutes', Coldplay is back with 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head'. <br />From the opening song 'Politik'to the last 'Amsterdam', you can't stop listening. There is not even one bad song. My favourites are 'Clocks', 'Warning Signs' and 'Amsterdam'. Buy this album!!!
B0000024SD|5.0|The historical significance of BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME has been discussed ad nauseum: It was Dylan making a strong break away from his folk roots. Its rock sound reshaped the music of the Beatles and just about everyone else who picked up a guitar forever after its 1965 release. It featured five of Dylan's most often covered and replayed classics -- &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; &quot;Maggie's Farm,&quot; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; and &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; -- as well as three more favorites of Dylan's core group of fans -- &quot;She Belongs to Me,&quot; &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; and &quot;Gates of Eden.&quot; It melded rock, folk and beatnik poetry for the first time in a major album. It was the start of the phase of Dylan's career that would soon include his two most lauded albums, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE.<br />But what is often not mentioned is how much FUN this album is to listen to.<br />Granted, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; &quot;It's Alright Ma&quot; and &quot;Gates of Eden&quot; are classic Dylan epics -- long, complex, packed with striking imagery and poetic wordplays in each line. But this album also features rocking pop hits that leave the listener bouncing in his seat (&quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot;), beautiful and melancholy love or love-gone-wrong songs (&quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit,&quot; &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;) and even shaggy dog stories showcasing the impish sense of humor that would later bring Dylan to mind when interpreters were attempting to identify the man behind the jester character in Don McLean's &quot;American Pie&quot; (&quot;On the Road Again,&quot; &quot;Bob Dylan's 115th Dream&quot;).<br />In other words, there's something on this album for every mood. Which may be why it's even more beloved for its singles than the future album epics HIGHWAY 61 and BLONDE ON BLONDE. And, in fact, BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME doesn't hang together as well as the succeeding two releases, and certainly not as well as JOHN WESLEY HARDING or NEW MORNING. But it's more versatile than any of those other albums. On the one hand, you can sit down and really LISTEN to it, catching all the nuances of Dylan's lyrics, admiring his musical fireworks, laughing at his jokes. Or you can play it in your car, at work, as background music while you write or clean or work out, and it's not distracting.<br />Best of all, you can take advantage of an aspect of CD's not available to the original vinyl audience. Simply press the &quot;Shuffle&quot; button, and this becomes a whole new album to be rediscovered.
B000069AUI|5.0|Bought the new album on Monday and I'm not dissappointed at all. I did wonder how they could follow Parachutes, but they have done. Again every track is good, and gets better with every listen. My advice when you buy this CD is to take it home and listen to the title track at full volume - you'll be blown away. The lyrics are full of typical Coldplay emotions - \\"I'm going out to buy a gun and start a war, if you can tell me something worth fighting for\\". <BR>\\"The Scientist\\" starts off slow but changes pace and ends up a classic track and will almost make you cry with their lyrics about lost love \\"Nobody said is was easy, no-one ever said it would be this hard, oh take me back to the start\\". <BR>The first track \\"Politik\\" starts almost like they are announcing their come-back.<BR>The music is different from Parachutes, but they have matured and produce a lovely clean sound once more. Go buy it - you won't be sorry. I am happy that they are around given the complete (garbage) that seems to be in the charts all the time. What a great band.
6305546789|5.0|Halloween is just one of the best pictures of horror ever made. Following the line of Psycho (remember that Dr. Loomis is the same doc that appears at the end of Psycho, studying the criminal conduct of Norman Bates), Halloween puts the serial killer anger in a mind that is the evil itself. Myers begins like human being, but finishes like an archetip of the human terror; the terror at night, at unknown things, a conduct that no matter how knowledge you have, you simply never, ever, will be able to forget or left behind. That's why the boogie man is inmortal, and why he follows his victims... in silence.<br />That's why Halloween is more than a simply horror movie, it's the representation of all horrors incarnates. It's just the best of the best... & Halloween II... well, see my review... It's the best of the rest.
B000069AUI|5.0|Cold play has impressed me once again. their last album was good but this is really really good.the guitar slash at the start of the song is the apt way to start and then it mellows. GADSBE.<BR>tracks 3, 4, 7, and 8 are perfect the rest are very good.<BR>all in all, do something that will uplift the stock market: buy, NO, Invest in this album and watch ur stocks grow.
6305137293|4.0|Personally, I saw this picture before \\"Halloween\\" and I was shock. Now, after i've seen all series, Halloween & Halloween II represents the complete story. Michael Myers is the evil made flesh and this sequel comprobe it. The suspense & developing of character made in the first picture, finish in this second chapter with a true bath of blood, provocated by the anger of Myers and his need to kill his sister.<BR>Both pictures, saw together, represents somekind of \\"antiheroe's saga\\": the origin, developement & finish of a killer mind that is the evil itself. That is my recomendation: see Halloween & Halloween II together, and let the taste of evil and blood surrounds you, the rest of sequels are just if you're not satisfied... like me!!
B000069AUI|3.0|Not being a fan of Coldplay and not having even heard \\"Parachutes\\", minus the singles \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\", I picked up \\"A rush of blood...\\" on the strength of the first offering, \\"In my place\\" after quickly  previewing the album before it's release.  Comparisons to Radiohead and the lesser, Travis, are undeniable given the lilting falsetto of Chris Martin is so akin to the vocalizations of those bands.  I'm pleasantly surprised by the overall melodic content of the record although tracks such as \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Green Eyes\\" and the title track wilt under the mopey sentimentality of Martin's delivery when not backed by a catchy hook.  Songs are memorable for so many reasons, be it a hypnotic riff or a lyric that mirrors your own fate.  Chris Martin's desperate pleas on \\"In my Place\\": \\"Please, please, please Come back and sing to me...\\" capture the intense longing of a broken soul.  The superb \\"Clocks\\" almost didn't make it onto the album, but it proves to be a standout track.  The chord changes are sublime and when Chris timidly sings \\"You are, You are\\" it is simply arresting. \\"Whisper\\" provides an interesting diversion and seems like a faultering Radiohead song.  \\"Warning Sign\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are other favourites, with the latter highlighting what Coldplay do best; graceful piano ballads, tinged with languishing guitars. Their sound is sort of a poppy, tempered melencholy.  Although lyrically often one dimensional, they are sonically more palatable and optimistic than the latest offerings from Thom Yorke and the boys, as good as those records are in their own right.  \\"A rush of blood to the head\\" is not groundbreaking,(nor does it have to be) but it will please their fans and should affirm Coldplay as a key force in the \\"Brit-pop\\" music scene.
B000062Y98|1.0|I don't know how somepeople can give 5 stars to this album. It's real bad sometimes sound like a \\"bad hardcore copy of 'The Who'\\", without musical creativity, an so on. Personally, I can's hear beyond the third song. Please don't waste your money!!! Hear it first.
0440219078|5.0|The story of Jonah and the Giver is one to be handed down through the generations. Reading this young people is a great way to realize that they have not been completely brainwashed by MTV and cable television. Teens delight in the suprises and discoveries that are revealed while reading The Giver. A wonderful book that will last throughout the ages.
B000067CPX|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was a great album. You may notice that several people have recommended it \\"instead of\\" By the Way. These people are a phenomenon within fans of the Chili Peppers who won't stop talking about that album. The Chili Peppers have grown as musicians and as people since making that album and you people need to catch up. Californication was melodic and complex. By the Way is a further test of the limits of music and the lyrics are more interesting than anything Anthony has come up with before. To all of you people who refer to the \\"lost greatness\\" of the Chili's and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO OWN MORE THAN ONE ALBUM. PLEASE BUY THIS AND CALIFORNICATION AND SHUT UP.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The sonics of the remaster -regular ceedee- are better than I hoped they would be. I couldn't be more pleased with this presentation of what I consider to be the zenith of the Stones recording career.
B000001GAM|5.0|Visual beauty is in the eye of the beholder as much as a symphony's aural beauty is in the hand of the baton-holder.  It is this highly personal and gradually diminishing art of conductorial interpretation that keeps dedicated music collectors perusing the Internet for the secret Furtwangler stash or newly uncovered Bernstein tape, so I am loathe to call a particular performance &quot;definitive&quot;.  However, if any rendition of a Bruckner symphony makes me want to sell my Bernstein, Furtwangler, Celibidache, Skrowaczewski, Horenstein, Tintner, Walter, Barenboim, Karajan, Jochum, Chailly, Wand, Schuricht, and Haitink recordings... it is Giulini's 1989 epiphany of sound called Bruckner's 9th.<br />Let me cut to the chase.  The inspiring depth of interprative achievement can be heard in something as small as the first 59-seconds of the 3rd movement: slow, but purposeful; mystical, but existential; emotional, but knowing; and eloquent, but precise.  Such poetic intelligence is conjured up by Giulini and his VPO magicians in every note and every movement: music as knowledge from some other dimension.  Specific molecules are excited and particular quarks tremble on the vibrations of such music:  a world is opened to the attentive listner through which he/she can glimpse a meaning to Being. (Hyperbole?  But isn't the quest for such exceptional life-enhancing knowledge the very reason one experiences art?  As Annie Dillard said, &quot;Why are we reading if not in hope of beauty laid bare, life heightened and its deepest mystery probed?&quot;)<br />The icing on the cake is a recording that is dynamic in its range, crystaline in its detail and state-of-the-art in its fidelity.<br />I cannot give higher praise than to say that I never really heard Bruckner's 9th until I had the honor of listening to Giulini and the VPO on this miracle of a recording.
0440234743|5.0|Reading this book gave me an idea of the 'new Grishams'. Stepping outside the courtroom for more than half the pages is a welcome change in Grisham's books, and gives this book its alure. Exciting storylines are mixed with classic Grisham legal matters, resulting in a story taking you down a river not quite like the Mississippian locale of storytelling we have come to know of this author.<br />The first chapter gives you insights you know the characters in the books can only guess after, which makes you laugh at these fantastically strange and brilliant people more than once: a recovering alcoholic, moneyhungry lawyers and a herd of greedy familymembers, all hovering over that one document, the testament.<br />Reading it will give you a couple of hours of entertainment, but be advised: open it, and you will close it only after the last page has been read....
0316666343|4.0|Alas, it seems that we are all bedeviled by the \\"angelmania\\" that<BR>has prevailed on TV and in Hallmark stores over the past few years. What else could account for all the negative reviews of this imaginative and well-written novel? It's not ABOUT angels, fellow readers; not ABOUT Heaven, with or without a LandLord. And as for Suzie's \\"Heaven\\" seeming flat, well, um, see--that's the point. (Not that HEAVEN is flat, but young SUZIE'S HEAVEN is<BR>premature. Metaphor, you see--just as harps and pearly gates and gold crowns are metaphors.) Well, in our Father's house there are many mansions....  But you know, sooner or later our culture is going to be obligated to deal with the growing body of evidence (and I'm not talking about the movie GHOST here!)that there seems to be some verifiable connection between the world of the living and the world of the departed. <BR>Let's not label as \\"sentimental\\" or \\"New Age\\" every novel that<BR>grapples with the implications of that possibility for mortals.

B00006EXDM|4.0|I owned this excellent package in vinyl the very first day it came out (wow!) 30 years ago. The music is, with no question, an exceptional bunch of songs in one place: no dispute there and therefore recommended as essential. I do disagree with ABCKO about their research for the best masters for this proyect: the lack of stereo Masters in Satisfaction, Mother's Little Helper, Off of my cloud is dissapointing. I do have these in my analog Hot Rocks CD I obtained while stationed in Germany in 1989. With less resolution, but in stereo, they do sound great.  Aside from my misgivings for being a definitive project with full utilization of stereo with the SACD format, I would still recommend it.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|Once again I say, \\"Wild Wild West\\" has got to be on of the worst films I have ever seen. I myself have never seen the original TV series starring Robert Conrad but the movie \\"Wild Wild West\\" was pretty awful. And the thing which really gets me is, it could have been such a terrific movie!<br />Two U.S. Marshals, Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) are assigned to discover why most of the country's leading scientists have been kidnapped. An old enemy of West's, General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine) lead them to the mastermind, a waist-high madman Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Dr. Loveless' plan? To take over the United States government! <br />The plot is nothing new, a madman threatens to take over the government with the help of a super machine created by kidnapped scientists. The only people who can save everyone are the two main characters. You've heard it before, huh? \\"Wild Wild West\\" was extremely interesting in the way they thought up of a way to combine lots of cool inventions and gadgets into a story of the 'wild west'. But it has its many downfalls. One being that the story seemed to lull at some points, like it's just something to fill in the time. There should have been more twists and turns, captures and escapes, or something!<br />The acting wasn't all that bad, though I must say I much more enjoy watching Will Smith in the \\"Men in Black\\" movies. He seems to have the exact same attitude, cockiness, and humor as he does in the movies I mentioned, except he lacks some smarts. He has a tendency to 'shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a question or two.' Unfortunately in this movie there really isn't given any chance for ANY of the characters to fully develop, let alone make you like and cheer for them. Kevin Kline for me was the best actor in the movie, him getting a chance to play two roles, one as Artemis Gordon and another as President Ulysses S. Grant.He was extremely charming and likable, a bit smarter and more sophisticated than his new partner. The bad guy played by Kenneth Branagh was nothing new, just your usual crazy madman. And though Salma Hayek is credited along with the main actors as Rita Escobar, you have no chance to see her much and for some reason was a very unlikable character. Though there was some attempt for Will Smith and Kevin Kline to vie for her affections, there is exactly 0% romance in this movie.<br />And the reason for the 0% romance is because of blatant sexual jokes and innuendos put into \\"Wild Wild West\\". For a PG-13 movie, I found it a bit too much, even resulting for me to fast forward and skip some parts. And I believe this is one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie. There were some moments where there was some good, clean, and fun humor, but the movie seems to mostly rely on innuendos and dirty jokes to make the audience laugh. And I assure you that I did not laugh much. \\"Wild Wild West\\" should have had some romance. Even most of the best action and adventure movies have romance, including such hits like \\"Matrix\\", \\"Top Gun\\", and much more.<br />But I must give \\"Wild Wild West\\" the minimum of two stars for the action and special effects. Some of the action is pretty intense and exciting, especially the end. And the oh so super gadgets are VERY cool! I especially love the President's 'not-so-normal' train. Dr. Loveless's gigantic spider is dynamic, too. And Artie's numerous disguises are ingenious!<br />To sum it up, \\"Wild Wild West\\" had some potential to become a fantastic movie. But because of the empty characterizations, somewhat empty plot, and terrible and sick jokes succeeds in making \\"Wild Wild West\\" a flop for me. If you're thinking about watching \\"Wild Wild West\\", rent it if you're really serious about seeing it. But here are two other recommendations, \\"Men in Black\\" stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who fight extra-terrestrial and \\"Silverado\\" stars KevinKline as a gunfighter who saves the town of Silverado.<br />Here an interesting bit of trivia for \\"Wild Wild West\\":<BR>The movie 'won' 5 statuettes at the 20th Annuel Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture. Robert Conrad, who played the original James West in the 1960s TV series, accepted 3 of the awards in person as his way of expressing his low opinion of what had been done with his source material. :)
0971855110|5.0|I had a \\"neat\\" house before I met FlyLady.  Neat in terms of the fact that I was able to stash all of my stuff in drawers and hide what I knew was there but couldn't do anything about.  When we'd have overnight guests, I'd do crisis cleaning through the night and into the morning, making me a wonderful conversationalist for company!  She's gotten me off my \\"franny\\" and my house, becoming de-cluttered, is now \\"CHAOS-free.\\"  <br />Through this system I've been able to get more time back for my family and toss the \\"martyrdom\\" I'd been portraying (\\"Oh, poor me, no family around to help, husband doesn't help, kids don't help, wah wah wah\\" -- Don't laugh, you say it too, maybe not in words, but in your actions!) I'm in control of my home, my housecleaning (home blessing), my family, and my life.  Thank you, Marla, for helping me reclaim it all back.  I've been singing your praises to anyone who will listen!
B000001DVV|5.0|This is 'Pop-metal', if you will forgive the slightly oxymoronic genre handle, of the highest order.<br />As insightful other reviewers have already pointed out, if this album had been released four or five years earlier than it was it could have propelled Ugly Kid Joe into the stratosphere, instead of being buried when the glut of grunge albums appearing in 1992 made them and this style of music very unfashionable very quickly.<br />This fact is a shame, because this is a very strong record from some talented players. Granted, it is hardly profound, it will not offer you spiritual enlightenment or political lyrics. What it does offer is a real sense of humour and fun, perfect fodder for the adolescent or the inner child inside us all.<br />It should be noted that Whitfield Crane's vocals are very strong, Klaus' guitar playing very accomplished, yet it is the strength of the songs that shine here.<br />'Neighbor' concerns a neighbour from hell, while 'Goddamn Devil' suggests we make a pact with the devil 'Grow our hair' and 'spread his word' in a metal band. Satirical maybe, hilarious almost, meant for fun certainly.<br />In other tracks, like 'Busy Bee' or a surprisingly well executed cover of Harry Chapin's 'Cats in the Cradle' the band show a more sensitive side, and prove themselves good musicians. Elsewhere, 'Panhandlin' Prince', 'So Damn Cool' and 'Dont Go' are catchy 80's songs with irresistible vocal melodies and moronic vocals, aided ably by twiddly guitars and crunch heavy riffs.<br />In short this album will not change your life, but the songs included will burrow into your brain and take up residence, as well as introducing a spring into your step and carefree listening.<br />Buy this album if you enjoy this style of music, or if you merely want to escape from reality into a world where little is serious and dancing idiotically mandatory.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This one of the cornerstone films for people who appreciate a beautiful love story that duplicates itself as a Shakespearan tale of Tragedy/Comedy/Love. Baz Luhrman is a GENIUS!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This record is a triumph for Queens of the Stone Age. They have finally solidified their line up, with the band now comprising Josh Homme, Nick Olivieri (both original members of the legendary Kyuss), Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees).<br />Describing their sound is difficult: the guitars are loud, bass rumbling, vocals by turns melodic or screamed incomprehensibly.<br />Dave Grohl's outstanding drumming has added an entire new dimension to the band though, as has Mark Lanegan's wonderful vocals, although the tracks Homme assumes vocal duties for shine just as brightly.<br />This is an ambitious record, and that fact is apparent from the very first strains of a mock radio show announcing the band. The entire album is held together by segues which satirise wonderfully the hypocrisy and poor quality of commercial radio stations: these are both hilarious and welcome.<br />Opener 'You think I aint worth a dollar....' is a brief aural assault, with Olivieri's trademark screeching dragging us into the record head first. The single 'No one Knows' follows, and this is a marked contrast, a catchy, quirky song with haunting melodies and possible hit potential delivered by Homme.<br />Acroos the entire album the sheer quality of songwriting and musicianship never lets up for a single second: 'First it Giveth', 'God is in the Radio' and 'Gonna leave you' are perfect slices of guitar driven, malancholy pseudo-pop songs, delivered as only this band can. 'The Sky is Fallin' and the incredible 'A song for the deaf' are more ambitious, menacing and progressive, and are two of the standout tracks included here.<br />'Six Shooter' is a single minute of sheer rage, once again with Olivieri's screech falling over metal music worthy of the heaviest band imaginable. The fact that this is followed by the haunting 'Hangin' Tree' with Lanegan assuming vocal duties for a smooth ballad only serves to highlight the diversity apparent on this record, and the incredible talent of these musicians.<br />Add to this the fact that snatches of Jazz, Mexican guitar, Heavy Metal, 60's pop melodies and Rock n' Roll combine on this record and its unique sound and status is clear.<br />If you enjoyed 'Rated R', the band's previous outing, you should tear yourself away from the computer immediately and purchase this album: you will not be dissapointed. If you didnt like 'Rated R', if you dont enjoy QOTSA, this advice still stands: this album really is indispensable for any music fan.<br />I have never heard anything quite like this, or anything quite as good. Utterly incredible.lent of these musicians.<BR>Add to this the fact that snatches of Jazz, Mexican guitar, Heavy Metal, 60's pop melodies and Rock n' Roll combine on this record and its unique sound and status is clear.<BR>If you enjoyed 'Rated R', the band's previous outing, you should tear yourself away from the computer immediately and purchase this album: you will not be dissapointed.

B00005T30L|4.0|Being a big fan of Daniel Clowe's book &quot;Ghostworld&quot;, the last thing that I would want would be a sub-par book to movie adaption such as &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; or another &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, but with Ghostworld,I was pleasantly surprised.<BR> Directed intelligently by Terry Zwigoff,and starring Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi,you can see that thought was put into this film, and they didn't pay millions for overpaid Hollywood actors and actresses. I was happy with basically every thing in the movie despite minor holes in the plot at the end.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a good D.V.D. and is definitely worth buying.
B00000JMQC|5.0|I first watched this when i was 10 yrs old when my mother brought it home one night for me to watch and I loved it more the origianal film. I am also glad they didnt go by the way Dorothy was portrayed in the later books as a short haired blonde,lol. Anyways, I loved how they mixed The Land of Oz and Ozma of OZ togehter. The sets were beautiful and well made to portray the book and I believe that they shoulkd actually come out with another movie just for the [heck] of it! Awsoem movie check it out. You wont be disapointed. oh by the way I am 17 now so yeah, lol.
0792157850|5.0|First of all, this film takes place in pre WW II history, perfectly setting up a more lush and exotic (Nazi-free) environ for the story to unfold. What really makes this movie a good time though, and a feast for movie fans, is it's countless references and homages to everything from Star Wars to The Thief Of Bagdad. But it's not just the in the references... the whole tone and feel is closer to a 70's Italian horror film in lusty embrace with a B serial from the 40's.  Instead of retreading the first one Spielberg and Lucas amped up the colors, matte paintings, grizzly effects and freaky  scares to create a delerious explosion of pulp vivacity. Raiders was the intro (so pretty tasteful in it's style), Last Crusade is a more family friendly and vanilla concoction, probably hastened by some family's outraged cries after seeing Temple. But boldened by the success of the first one -- Temple of Doom is the chapter that was made for FILM FANS and FILMMAKERS. It's crazy, gross, scary, politically incorrect, but above all -- a blast to watch.
B000068PQ0|3.0|With a title patterned after e-mails attempting to describe the death of the band's close Japanese friend Yoshimi and a musical vibe patterned after a mesh of early Feeder, laid back Californian rock and the technical dubbing skills of the band members, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a rare breed. It's an album which invites casual listening- and hence perhaps commercial success, at long last, for the band, but also allows the true music fan to indulge themselves in forty three minutes of musical pleasure. Despite being the brainchild of a mere three individuals, this album has a pleasing level of musical complexity and oozes coolness from every pore. The bare bones of the album, acoustic, unplugged riffs coupled (with varying degrees of success) with electric and often multi-layered drum beats and fills are washed over with a collection of electric and keyboard melodies and blues inspired bass lines that together create a strange but often rewarding musical package. The title track, divided into two parts, one an upbeat, hook-heavy affair laden with positive feeling and happy reflection on the life of a friend, the other a darker, more moody, instrumental only affair with strange whizzing and popping, punctuated by screaming. The bands J-Pop influence extends beyond the title track though; from the pastel drawings on the album cover (covered in kanji and kana, the Japanese alphabets), to the East-Meets-West melodies on certain tracks, this album pays more than a passing tribute to the land from which Yoshimi hails. The album's eleven tracks are balanced fairly evenly between those with commercial appeal (lets not discount them just because of that) and more musical numbers; although the song titles are impenetrable, the album is fairly easy to get into, even with no prior knowledge of the band. The high, delicate vocals, complete with Californian lilt, gel well with the complex drum beats (both authentic and generated) and synth tunes that make up most of the songs; their high notes become almost un-human at times, further aiding the slightly futuristic, techno-influenced sounds that sit atop this essentially peerless guitar pop album. It's an interesting blend, equally pleasant for the nonchalant listener or the hardened fan. There's nothing resolutely bad on he album, a few tracks are flimsy bits of nothingness, it has to be said, but that's to be expected when the two genres being merged (Californian guitar pop and techno) can both often be flimsy and air-filled. It's an all round good album, with a nice creative flow, that meshes the two genres nicely into a satisfying compound. The reasons, therefore behind its three-star rating, are thus. The album doesn't have one track that stands out and screams at you: AWESOME! It's all very good, none of it awful, and some of it damn great, but nothing nudges up into the classic or near-classic category. It's an enjoyable album, pleasurable to listen to, and bodes well for the future of the band, but it lacks a certain something that would propel into the upper echelons of cool.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie proves once and for all that you don't need a lot of blood and gore to show that \\"War is Hell.\\"  That fact is very apparent by the way the story unfolds, and by the way the characters interact, especially those on opposing sides.  You don't need excessive violence to show the pain and heartache that is associated with war.  <BR>Rather than focus on the physical horrors of war, this movie endeavors to show the emotional terror, and does the job remarkably well.  This is accomplished mainly by the development of characters on both sides.  Upon watching this movie, it is impossible to decide who are the 'good guys' and who are the 'bad guys.'<BR>This is the main reason why this movie is so great--it accurately portrays the underlying aspect of the Civil War; there were no 'good guys', and nobody 'won'.  This movie shows this tragic fact--that even the so-called 'victors' (the North) lost a great deal from the war.<BR>As mentioned, the use of characters in this movie is moving.  There are officers who'd served together in previous conflicts, men who respected one another greatly, even two best friends.  I don't think it was possible for anyone to hate the enemy, or even to rightly call him 'enemy.'  They were simply fighting for a cause.<BR>As has been abundantly mentioned in these reviews, this movie is over four hours long, but it does not become tedious.  Every scene in this movie contributes to it's power, to it's message.  It is worth watching over and over again.<br />I won't say that this movie is totally accurate (I doubt any movie is), but I will say that this is a fair portrayal of what happened.  What this movie lacks in incidental details, it makes up in emotional power.<BR>For an accurate narrative of the Civil War, and for a good look into how the men who fought this most tragic of wars and this most devastating of battles must have felt, there is no better film than Gettysburg.
0471413909|5.0|I laughed out loud when I read the customer review that said \\"I lost too much weight\\". What, are people jealous?<br />I've been on this diet for about four months now and have lost 30 lbs, and regained my fitness and health, as well as putting more muscle on than I've ever been able to do before. Sure, don't go on this diet if you don't like being incredibly fit.<br />I was a sub 3 hr marathoner at age 35 when I started to inexplicably gain weight. I was eating very little protein at the time, around 20 grams a day, despite running about 100 km a week at the time. Dumb, I know, but it worked for a long time. I wasn't getting injured, nor did I have any health problems (except a problem with acne that started at age 30). I ate a lot of grain-based foods, which is typical for endurance athletes. <br />My health deteriorated, and I gained 35 lbs in less than six months. I also got pneumonia twice, and developed asthma. My LDL level was twice the maximum that is acceptable. All of these problems are accounted for in this book. <br />I first saw Cordain's work mentioned in Joe Friel's Mtn. Bike Training Bible, and followed up. <br />All of my symptoms have disappeared. Not only have I lost the weight, my blood work is excellent, and I'm putting on muscle faster than I did even in my early 20s (I'm 38 now). I'm up to 200 crunches, for example, only two months after barely being able to manage 5. My average run pace has dropped from 8:30 per mile to sub 6 minutes per mile in only two months, on 3 hrs of training a week. After only 3 sessions on my track bike (all around 10km in length), I was able to crank out 36 km/hr over 10km on my track bike. That's on ZERO mileage over the past three years.<br />Others have asked me how I did it, and they are getting similar results and feeling great.<br />This research makes a tremendous amount of sense, and it's given an athlete his body (and hope) back. Thanks, Dr. Cordain.
080018789X|5.0|i know this may not help anyone but im gunna say it anyway~i love this movie ever since it came out~i have watched it over 22 times in one year~and yea we really did count~the sad thing is im 16 now and well you can do the math to see how old i was when it came out~i know all the words and everything~No i dont need any special help for it-i just really enjoy movies!~im actually on way to watch it again(note i havent watched it in a long time)~but i recommend this movie to everyone~whether you like these kinds of moives or not~whether you like Tom Cruise or not~i mean Johnathan Lipniki(spelling?) is just so adorable in it that he could even be a main reason to watch it...ok maybe not but anyways~yes go rent it go buy it do whatever it takes to get this movie!
B000069CWE|5.0|If you like LP's first cd (Hybird Theory) then you will love this one... it is remixes of all their songs and with 4 new songs (X-ecutioner Style, H! Vltg3, My&lt;Dsmbr, and Ntr\Mssion) unless you count the opening and these little phone call things... :/  but if you liked LP'd first CD then GET THIS CD. You wont be dissapointed (one or two songs are wierd though).
B000002H2H|5.0|I was not expecting much of the album when I bought it. I thought it would be alright. I was wrong. It starts with \\"Fight ire With Fire,\\" the fastest (garbage) metal song on that album. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" has the most powerful riffs, they stuck in my head for a  long time. \\"Fade to Black\\" is a great ballad with one of my favorite metallica solos. \\"Creeping Death\\" is the second fastest song, and its really good! I'd say my favorite song is \\"The Call of Ktulu,\\" an 8 minute plus instrumental song, and it is just amazing. Definetely worth buying.
B00006G8G1|5.0|I was skeptical getting this DVD bacause I just wasn't impressed with their last 4 albums, especially 'X Factor' and 'Virtual XI'. But, since it's Maiden... I had to buy it (after all, I own every CD/Import/VHS/DVD they have). You see... I grew up on Maiden, way back when 'Peice of Mind' was released in '83. I've seen them on every tour since 'Somewhere in Time' and each time, they were great live. They're simply a bunch of guys that care about their music and their fans and nothing more.<br />In terms of quality: Steve did a phenominal job on editing and sound. It couldn't have been better, especially the surround sound! The picture quality is superb. You see every band member equally, even some great shots of Dave's, Adrian's, and Jannick's solos. Bruce gives an amazing performace as well. And all the extra footage is great too.<br />In terms of song selection: That's were I'm dissapointed. As a die hard Maiden fan, I love the old stuff... everything from their first album to 'Fear...'. Although the newer stuff is not bad, I just don't care for it much.<br />Nonetheless, IT IS a great DVD. It shows the guys are still having fun performing live and providing their fans with great music. Unfortunately, there aren't enough bands out there that can deliver like Iron Maiden can. They will always be a part of my life as well as heavy metal history. I just hope they will continue for many years to come.
B000003S0D|5.0|I like all of the King Crimsom albums, but this is my favorite. The music will elevate you to another plane. I'm on my third copy- two vinyl and now the CD. If you like acid rock and jazz, this is the perfect combination. Adjust your mood, turn up the volume and soar!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|Since becoming a larger than life fan of Alanis, I've always been reluctant to pick up her sophomore effort, SFIJ.  My friends consider it to be the weakest of her three studio albums.  Unable to put off my curiousity, i bought a copy.  With the first track, i was completely enthralled.  The complexity, originality, and humor of \\"Front Row\\" caught me by surprise.  IT's immediately followed by another highlight, \\"Baba\\"  recalling much with her battle with spirituality of \\"Forgiven\\" in JLP.  Of the sparsely produced tracks, \\"Thank U\\" works best.  Are u Mad is the \\"You oughta know\\" of this album.  Simple, yet ingenuous.  The flute solo towards the end of \\"That i would be good\\" is mediocre at best but u can't help but appreciate her boldness in showcasing her musicianship.  The \\"Couch\\" is more or less an epic, a telling of several stories within 5:30 minutes.  Another song that struck a cord was \\"I was hoping.\\"  the atmosphere of \\"would not come\\" is strictly erotic.  the electric guitar enhances the sensuality and anger of her mysterious vocals.  \\"Unsent\\" is an inoffensive, unconventional tune.  Very likeable, however.  Perhaps one of the album's pure delights is \\"So Pure.\\"  Of JLP, SFIJ, and URS, this is her only dance track.  It rivals that of Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\", but never saw much of commercial success.  The last song worth giving time to is \\"Joining U.\\"  Another track that's dark, and ingenuous.It's about one of her dearest childhood friends on the verge of committing suicide.  ALthough no chorus is built into the song, it's structure comes off as natural.   Although none of the songs will ever be played again by radio years from now (with perhaps the exception of \\"thank u\\"), it's her best work to date.  It proves that she was not a fluke or an oppurtunistic angry chic.
6301942647|5.0|This film is fantastic--at least to me. It's painful and beautiful. Having lived in Japan when young, I was struck at a very basic level by Kurosowa's imagery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the listed price for this classic is insanely high. (Thank the gods I taped it from my satellite dish!) Nonetheless, I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />I'm sure it isn't everyone's \\"cup of tea,\\" but I loved iAppended in 2012: I'm gratified to see that the price for this classic is coming down.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I made the natural transition from Kyuss to Queens of the Stone Age when I heard all about the buzz about Rated R.  I loved Kyuss, and still believe they are the kings of stoner rock, and I now love Queens even more.  When I first listened to Rated R I had doubts, not catching the high level of musicmanship at first. Not only did I do a 180 with my opinion after listening to it again but I now declare it one of the best records I've ever heard.  As for this new record, Songs for the Deaf, it is indeed harder but still filled with awesome riffs.  I bought the album today, August 27th, on its release date and I'm listening to it as I write this.  I'm probably the first one to move the record from the Best Buy I got it from and I'm damn proud of it.  Way to go Queens, you ARE the rock band of the new millenium.

0440219078|5.0|This book is written for teens, and I as an adult could not put it down once I started it, I mean I sat and read it from beginning to end, no breaks. This is the only book I have ever done that with. I was facinated with the society, where everyone is given volunteer work as a older child and then a career is determined for you by a group of older members (of the society). Jonas is given an unusual assignment: The Giver. It is very secretive and he is not allowed to share his learnings with anyone. I was compelled by this society that tries to make life good for everyone but yet contains such subtle horrors: such as if a twin is born, one must be killed! And then there is what is revealed to Jonas through an old man called the Giver, that Jonas didn't even know about love (amongst other things!) I recommend that if you haven't read this yet, READ IT s it is a quite facinating and different book.
B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtime Stories is without a doubt a Tour De Force of pop, yet mellow songs. This is Madonna's uprising from the very early material from the ninties. I didn't like EROTICA that much, but Bedtime Stories was a change in a different direction for the material girl. Not even BRITNEY SPEARS can top this, and they just happen to be fans of each other. From SECRET to FORBIDDEN LOVE to even HUMAN NATURE,all of these songs gets better and better. The best song to me on this CD is TAKE A BOW. It's a perfect way to end the CD with. A DEFINITE CD TO GO TO SLEEP BY.
0385194676|5.0|Warning! Anyone who thinks Michael Jackson is a horrible, disgusting criminal and wants to continue to believe this, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!--I repeat-- If you want to believe the tabloids and such about Michael Jackson, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!...... Now for those of us who don't believe the tabloids or want to learn more about Michael, this is the book for you. No one else can describe Michael's life better than the King of Pop himself. His words are amazing. There are parts that will make you laugh. There are parts that will make you want to scream in anger. There are parts that will bring you to peace. All in all, Michael is an inspiration and no one can relate his story better. I highly recommend this book.
0452282152|5.0|This is the first book I have not put down once I opened it in years.  Not because of page turning suspense, but because I did not want to leave it's beautiful world.  Not since I read Flower Drum Song and The Feast of All Saints have I been so satisfied.
B00005YUNY|5.0|When this DVD arrived in the mail, I figured I'd take a quick peek just to see what I could look forward to when I had the time to actually sit down and view it.  194 minutes later, I came out of my trance.<br />This is a spectacular concert, expertly filmed and brilliantly mixed.  If I could only own one Yes video, this would certainly be it.  The orchestral arrangements are masterful, and the band members have never been stronger.  It's a glorious white-knuckle ride all the way.<br />The bonus disk material is great for hard-core fans, but it's home video quality so don't expect anything more than that.  I do wish they had included a full and uninterrupted version of Tim Panella's mix of \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" over the bonus disk's credits.<br />This concert is absolutely stellar.  And it's FUN to watch, because everyone on stage, including all of the orchestra members, are obviously having a blast playing and enjoying themselves in the process of making this amazing music.<br />I often find myself shaking my head at how many live versions of Yes' most popular songs are out there, and although I would love to have heard more songs from \\"Magnification\\", don't be fooled into thinking that this is \\"yet another\\" live Yes album.  The new orchestral arrangements give every song a totally different feel, and, combined with the great visual presentation, make these versions indispensable.<br />Awesome stuff.  Bravo, Yes!!!
B00000JGHM|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest pairings in cinema history.  Pacino and Deniro give one hell of a performance as hunter vs. hunted, respectfully.  This almost 3 hour long vehicle showing this conflict between the two, as well as the conflicts with the people that surround them in their lives are shown in such a way that further rivets you to your seat as you watch this cat and mouse game unfold, especially the L.A. shootout that makes the O.K. Corral look like Disneyland.  Both actors, legendary for their roles in such gangland classics (i.e. Scarface, Goodfellas, The Godfather movies)give enough reason for you to watch this movie.  Even if these movies arent your thing, youll want to watch just for the sheer presence of these 2 talented actors, as well as Michael Mann's sheer slickness in directing this classic.  Personally, I think its one of the best crime drama movies made in the last 20 years and youll agree with me too.
0790749815|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Hitchcock films, mainly because when you view the whole, you realize that it doesn't really fit into the typical suspense or horror category. It dosen't have the graphic gore of PSYCHO or the psychological eeriness of VERTIGO. It is more of an adventure film, a rollicking roller-coaster of entertainment infused with wry comedy, romance, glamour, and superb cinematography which sustains your interest, amazingly, for more than 130 minutes. And all the performances are memorable- from Grant's cynical executive to Eva Marie Saint's beautiful, smoldering agent, to James Mason's urbane, silky, villain. It comes right at the end of probably the director's greatest period of films- his 50's carousel of hits, including STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, TO CATCH A THIEF, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, and the redux MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It also manages to make train travel exceedingly glamorous!!
B00006GFAB|3.0|Most of the songs ARE good but, the BEST song is &quot;God Gave Rock N Roll To You (part II ???).  That song just makes me a &quot;Believer&quot; (Again), in KISS, God, (the UNbelieveables).         The very best of KISS is BETTER than their &quot;other&quot;&quot;greatest hits&quot; &quot;albums&quot;.  A MUST for us KISS fans, despite the repeats of the SAME releases.
B00005QDW1|5.0|To take it right away: this CD is fab! I saw ND the first time on a little Punk Festival in Santa Barbara in 1995 and then two more times - each time in a bigger venue with more people. But guess what. It was no problem for No Doubt to capture the audiences! Gwen tigered around on stage and wasn't short to spread her incredible charisma! Listening to the new CD brings back these good memories. The sound is fresh as ever and this time has a humorous glance back to the 80's with all the synthy [crud] that was played back then. HELLA GOOD is an incredible song that makes you jumping and dancing around, so does as well HEY BABY as many of the others. Thinking recently of a rejuvenating cure? Save your money and buy this CD. Makes you guaranteed a few years younger!  : )
B000069AUI|5.0|There is no doubt that with this recording, Coldplay have arrived as one the most musically accomplished groups of the past 10 years. A Rush of Blood To The Head transcends any inkling of the stereotype of Brit-pop, one-hit wonder that might ever have been associated with Coldplay, and has produced one of the most incredibly enjoyable records to listen to in years.  With songs that journey from raucous, melancholy rants to unimaginably sweet melodic graces, each song is proof that you will be pleased with the purchase of this record during every listening. Enigmatic, enthralling, and utterly brilliant music.

B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is practically the best i've ever listened to. The songs are a great mix of rock, soft songs and almost countryish songs. The lyrics blew me away! I can relate to them so much, it's like they came straight out of my head and onto the cd. BUY THIS TODAY!!!
0446608955|1.0|At first, I was told by a friend that this book was really good, but really sad.  Over the summer, I read a couple of customer reviews and they were all saying how good and touching and moving this book was.  So I decided to read it.  I was on the verge of buying this book when I picked it up in the local library.  And am I glad I saved my allowance by borrowing this book!  I couldn't even finish reading it.  It was 1) Extremely boring 2) uses the phrase ' if you know what I mean\\" too much. 3) Marrying at 17?  Give me a break. 4) Unrealistic 5) Too cheesy and sappy 6) The author, Nicholas Sparks, wrote about his proposal in the acknowledgement page of the book. I really think that the story of his 'joyous' proposal didn't belong in the book.<br />I would not recommend this book to anybody except for people who still believe that Barney is a real dinosaur( young girls who dream of becoming princesses).  I guess the author was trying to sound like a seventeen-year-old by puting in stuff like' if you know what I mean', but instead, he made Landon Carter sound like a moron. If you must read the book, have it your way, but personally, I think it was not something I would ever want to read.  In comparison to other books I've read this summer, this one would be my least favourite.
B000069AUI|5.0|If anyone had doubts that coldplay would be a lesser band after releasing there follow up to the incredible Parachutes, then just give there new cd a listen.  While its not as dramatic and sorrowfull as their debut albumn, A Rush of Blood to the Head is incredible from start to finish.  If you liked their first albumn do your self a favor and buy this cd.
0316666343|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  You feel as if you are in heaven with Susie looking down on earth.  You want to help her family and friends find the killer. It is a great depiction of how each person handle's death in a different way.  I enjoyed the author's take on heaven.  I thought it was quite original.  Very good.
B000066RIM|5.0|Although this collection doesn't follow chronological order like the US release, I still prefer it because it contains one hit that was not included on the US version, &quot;Soul Inspiration.&quot; It also includes &quot;When You Love Someone&quot; (a duet with James Ingram) and &quot;Good Enough,&quot; one of the best tracks from GIVING YOU THE BEST THAT I'VE GOT.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head : Parachutes :: O.K. Computer : The Bends<br />This album is deep and brilliant.  I can't get enough...
B00003CXI1|3.0|I did not have high expectations for the movie, because frankly I thought live action to be a poor choice for an adaptation of a highly magical work.  However, I found that I was wrong and live action indeed worked admirably.<br />The movie is enjoyable and will be highly prized especially by those who have not read the books.  However, for those who have I think many will be disappointed.  The movie lacks the sparkle of the first novel since many of the humorous vignettes that make the book special have been deleted for lack of time.  I would have gladly spared some compression of the plot to spend more time with the Weasleys and other important though not large characters.<br />The main players are fine in their roles.  The standouts being newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson playing Ron and Hermione.  This is a good movie just not as good as it could or should have been.
0060926317|3.0|At first, since I've been enthralled by Australia and aboriginal culture, I read this and loved it. Without thinking, without engaging critical analysis. But then I started putting together the pieces and comparing this book with all the others I've read and wondering about the discrepancies. So, this book becomes a 3 star instead of 5. Although the concensus of Aboriginal peoples seems to be that this book is an outrage, I did find many concepts worth turning over in my mind. So, beware...don't be taken in as I was before doing research.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Reviewer: A music fan from Chicago, IL United States  <BR>This is POP music. This is not Rock & Roll ... nor are they the saviours of the american music scene -- that is a hard burden to carry by anyone. Truth -- They are rich kids. Truth -- their songs sound unoriginal compared let's say to the White Stripes, The Warlocks or even Vax Wallo. I am not a music snob -- I just call them like I see them. <br />The american music scene is alive an well living in the underbelly of your cities. Detroit, Chicago, L.A., NY Austin, Seattle .. but please don't give mumbo jumbo about this band. The Strokes only accolade should be is that the true Musicians/artist will shine through the fog they emitted.<br />\\"A sucker is born every minute\\"
B00004RFCM|5.0|I have only caught a few episodes of this show on HBO when visiting friends, as i do not have HBO myself.  But its such a great show, so i had to get this set.  Sarah Jessica Parker is just a genius!  For anyone who loves this show, or anyone who just wants to see women have fun, this is a great set to own.  I plan to get the 2nd and 3rd season soon. :)
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's follow up album evolves flawlessly from Parachutes. It's hard to say which tracks are the best since it flows so smoothly. I loved \\"In My Place\\" ever since I heard it on the radio and I'm glad their CD is finally here. Rush out and buy it. You won't be disappointed!!
0316743003|4.0|For 16 years Ben Rich was the head of Skunk Works, Lockheed Corporation's secretive special projects division.  In this engrossing work, he examines 40 years of aerospace innovations, including the U-2, F-117, and (my favorite) the SR-71 Blackbird.  Although the book is all about incredible innovations, do not fear that this book will be overly technical; I never bogged down while reading it and found a lot of it humorous, in fact.  (On the same point, it's only fair to note that if you ARE looking for a highly technical work, this is probably not the book you want.)<br />I must admit that I grew up playing endlessly with toy jet-fighters, and thus for subject matter alone I would have to give three stars.  Rather than telling the history of Skunk Works strictly chronologically, Rich breaks the book down into chapters that focus on specific projects.  This approach avoids confusion that might arise from the overlapping development of multiple aircraft.  It also allows the reader to go back and read about one particular plane without wading through unrelated information.  Each chapter also contains \\"Other Voices,\\" short sections written by others involved in the aerospace or defense industries.  Many of these sections were written by pilots and provided some of the book's most exciting passages.  I thought the \\"Other Voices\\" were a great addition that expanded the scope of Rich's work.<br />I also appreciated that this book was not propaganda for the military-industrial complex (a rut I believe Tom Clancy has fallen in).  Rich is justifiably proud of Skunk Works' successes, but he also admits their failures, notably: an attempt in the late `50s to create a plane fueled by liquid hydrogen, and also a stealth catamaran ship.  He is also quick to point out the serious flaws with the military's business procedures and candidly asks, \\"Do the virtuous get their just rewards?  The short answer is not if they're dealing with the Pentagon on a regular basis\\" (p. 302).  The final chapter is devoted to discussing the future of aerospace research and ways the military-industrial complex can become more efficient.  For example, he shows that the government could save huge amounts of money if Lockheed aircraft were serviced by trained, experienced Lockheed workers, instead of military personnel who are constantly shifted.  Yes, it's a somewhat self-serving suggestion, but it also seems fiscally responsible!  I thought I would find the final chapter dull, but as a tax-payer it was actually an eye-opener!<br />My complaints are limited.  The non-linear organization works fine when discussing airplanes, but it hampers the book's main \\"sub-plot\\": the ongoing relationship between Rich and Kelly Johnson, his predecessor as the head of Skunk Works.  Rich paints a vivid picture of the curmudgeonly Johnson, but the development of their relationship is chopped up by the organization of the book.  And although the book doesn't warrant an extensive bibliography, some references to other works would give the reader a chance to explore the topic more thoroughly.  But neither of these points significantly detracted from my experience.  This is an easy and enjoyable read for any arm-chair fighter jock.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the rare albums I've listened to this year that gets better each time I listen through it.  They have their own sound but I hear U2/Beatles/Pink Floyd styles in these songs as well, which is kind of cool.
B000068TPN|5.0|Excellent, Excellent movie! My favorite Mel Gibson movie next to Braveheart. This is now my favorite Vietnam movie along with The Siege of Firebase Gloria [only available on vhs] and Hamburger Hill. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and a lump in my throat for most of the film. Can't recommend this highly enough. Much better than Black Hawk Down or Behind Enemy Lines.
B00005UEAR|4.0|This album took awhile time to digest and enjoy, at leatst 3 or 4 listens before I &quot;understood&quot;. I'm not a big fan of earlier stuff like 1990's &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;, but 1999's &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; blew me away. Like other Dream Theater material, the music features top notch musicianship and lengthy songs that will take a few listens to get into. The first CD consists of 5 songs and the average length of each song is over 10 minutes. For the most part it some classic Dream Theater but with a new heavier edge. My favorite is &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, which opens with a series of sound clips and atmospheric mood setting music. The lyrics don't really make it clear whether the band is for or against stem cell research, as it shows both sides of the argument. CD 2 is my favorite,... A 42 minute-long concept song broken into 8 parts (tracks). As with Scenes From a Memory, I havn't really figured out the story... I guess it's probably supposed to be that way. It opens with a movie-like orchestral (&quot;Overture&quot;) intro and starts with the catchy &quot;About to Crash&quot;. Another highlight is the soothing &quot;Goodnight Kiss&quot; which opens with a cool flange-soaked guitar effect. It then breaks into &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; which features a 12-string guitar, catchy keyboard melodies and a solid chorus. This, along with &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot;, is a classic that is essential if you like progressive music or concept albums.
B000002J2B|5.0|With the exception of WOT Gorilla the music on this album is amongst the finest Genesis has produced. The rating should have been 4 and three quarters because it does not equal The Lamb lies down on Broadway, but it comes close. The truly outstanding songs are One for the Vine, 11th earl of Mar, Blood on the rooftops. And then there is that absurd song about the nightly adventures of a mouse. This song alone is worth the rating. Simply a great album.
B0000640VM|2.0|this disney non-classic(it was part of disney's dark age) is widely consideered to be the worst disney toon. Leonard maltin called it &quot; the grittiest of all the disney movies&quot; he was far from wrong.  This film isnt a poor film, its only fair.  I guess all good things do happen after bad things.  This film was so bad, that it made sense that &quot; The little mermaid&quot; came after it. That was a four star movie.  Oliver and company is 2 stars.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album rocks! It's a little more upbeat than \\"Parachutes\\" but it's an excellent album. I had listened to a preview of the album a few times at arushofbloodtothehead.com and it was excellent. I bought the cd and I immediately knew which songs were my favorites which are \\"God put a smile upon your face\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\". Even if you have only heard \\"In my Place\\", get this album! I gurantee you you will not regret it. Don't be afraid to like Coldplay! They're an excellent band and Chris Martin's voice is amazing. Although their previous album, \\"Parachutes\\", was a little more mellow, it's still just as good. I recommend adding them both to your cd collection. You won't regret it :)
B00006AFUR|4.0|I expected this to be just another boring nu-metal release dripping with unoriginality in the reigns of Trust Company, Linkin Park, Slipknot, and Papa Roach. Surprisingly, it seems to be alot more. This is alot more sophisticated and has a feel of that similar to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. by Incubus or Transistor by 311. Even a little bit of that Orgy/Videodrone/Uranium 235 sound going on in here. The booklet in the CD has a whole bunch of weird things in it to make you wonder what these guys are really all about if the music didn't already have you wondering that. &quot;Year Zero&quot; is my current favorite but &quot;93 Million Miles&quot; and &quot;Capricorn&quot; are pretty decent as well. It's nothing to go crazy over, but it's pretty interesting for the most part.
0316666343|4.0|I culdn't put it down. I knew this after the third page so I made a pot of coffee and stayed up til 3am to finish it. It was direct, thoughtful, gentle. The good guys win, but that is not the point of the book. A whole new approach to death and life.
B000069AUI|5.0|Spin Magazine termed this CD as something Bono (from U2) could make after spending 3 weeks on an iceberg with Sigur Ros.  This description is not far from the truth.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is breathtaking, depressing, uplifting, hopefull, and hopeless all at once.  The opening track, \\"Politik\\", is a great start to the CD.  \\"In My Place\\" follows that, a song similar to \\"Yellow\\" but not as happy sounding.  The third track \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\" is a more fast paced song that is complemented well by the slower, more heartfelt \\"The Scientist\\".  Track 5, \\"Clocks\\", is the second best Coldplay song of all time, only below \\"Trouble\\".  It can be equated to \\"Shiver\\" from \\"parachutes.  Other notable tracks include \\"Warning Sign\\" and the Title track \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" where singer Chris Martin goes from a soft, gentle voice to a striking contrast for the chorus.  Coldplay's latest is not the best, but it's better than most Music today.  If you loved \\"Parachutes\\" you'll love this just as much.  A MUST BUY.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time. I love the DVD just as much. Especially enjoyable are the bonus features like the commentary.
B00005B6C9|3.0|I consider myself to be a loyal Bee Gees fan. I eagerly awaited the release of this CD, only to be very disappointed overall.<BR>There are a few fine moments here. Maurice's 'Beach Boy' inspired &quot;Walking On Air&quot;, and the catchy, danceable &quot;Embrace&quot; with Robin on lead are stand-outs. However, &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot;, &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, and the horrid &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; are painful to listen to. Some bonus tracks available as B-sides from these recording sessions could have been better choices as album tracks. <BR>If you don't already own their earlier releases &quot;One&quot;, &quot;High Civilization&quot; or &quot;Size Isn't Everything&quot;, they are all much better choices than this mediocre (at best)CD.
B00006GA48|5.0|&quot;Closer To Home&quot; was released in 1970 and in my opinion was one of Grand Funk's best albums. The entire album is excellent with no filler whatsoever. Grand Funk were comprised of Mark Farner (lead guitar/vocals), Don Brewer (drums/vocals) and Mel Schacher (bass guitar). The three of them made some of the 70's best loved rock music and this remastered cd is evidence that their music continues to live on. The track listing is as follows: 1) Sin's A Good Man's Brother, 2) Aimless Lady, 3) Nothing Is The Same, 4) Mean Mistreater, 5) Get It Together, 6) I Don't Have To Sing The blues, 7) Hooked On Love, 8) I'm Your Captain, and the bonus tracks 9) Mean Mistreater (Alternate Mix), 10) In Need (Live), 11) Heartbreaker (Live), and 12) Mean Mistreater (Live). The standouts on this cd are many starting with the obvious &quot;I'm Your Captain&quot;, as well as &quot;Mean Mistreater&quot;, &quot;Aimless Lady&quot;, and &quot;Sin's A Good Man's Brother&quot;. The bonus tracks are mostly &quot;live&quot; cuts and really give the listener a feel for how great Grand Funk were in concert. The inner cd sleeve also contains valuable information regarding the making of this album as well as some nice photos. This is the one classic Grand Funk album I've been waiting years to have. And thanks to Captol Records, they've made this plus other Grand Funk cd's available in remastered form plus bonus tracks. Highly recommended!
B00006690G|5.0|As a first-time listener of Eminem, this CD was truly an eye-opener.  His fresh, cutting, and witty lyrics dominate.  He leaves no stone unturned, name-dropping where necessary.  His clarity of thought emerges in a few clear themes, including Batman and Robin, the diatribes about his daughter and his ex-wife, his run-ins with the law, and his tales of the woes of stardom.  No doubt, once you hear this man out, you will begin to see that he has truly been misunderstood and typecast as someone who is immoral and generally \\"bad,\\" when in fact one pulls back the curtain and sees that he has a heart made of flesh just like everyone else, a someone with exceptionally good writing and rapping talents.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is amazing; I wish I could give it 7 stars! Every song on this album is beautiful, and Coldplay has truly shown their growth since \\"Parachutes\\". BUY IT NOW!!!
1858286999|4.0|This guide has not those beautiful pictures of, say, the National Geographic guide, nor it has very detailed maps. That may be the meaning of &quot;rough.&quot;<br />We had a bad experience when visiting Hokkaido: The book said a recommended site was 50 km South from the station we would get to. So we planned our trip with that idea in mind. But in the way we found the site at a map and it was 50 km NORTH! We had to change the plan and get to a &quot;less recommended&quot; site by the same guide (yes, the poor bears should return to the forests). It wasn't that bad but I can't compare, you see.<br />So please CONFIRM the places you are going in a map. You could get one (or take a look in an atlas) in a tourist information center or the like. Don't always trust the guide.<br />However, we got useful information from the guide, like a nice Youth Hostel that was not listed in a very good Japanese book of accomodations. In the guide you'll find the phone numbers and even the web page.<br />The maps have only the minimum information: you have to ask in the station about the time you need to get to every place, because not all the stations are drawn in the guide's maps.
B000002UTY|5.0|I own three versions of this CD: the US Capitol 1988 release (CDP 7 91215 2); the currently available US Capitol re-release (CDP 0777 7 91215 2 6); and Repertoire's 2000 release, which states it was \\"restored & remastered by EROC at the ranch\\" and made under license from EMI ELECTROLA GmBH.  While Happy Trails is one of rock's greatest live albums, all three CD's are, in my opinion, sonically deficient.  The two US releases sound thin and lack bass.  The Repertoire CD, on the other hand, sounds like its bass has been artificially boosted and its highs dulled.  Another reviewer has also noticed this, pointing out that the Repertoire CD seems to have be \\"digitally\\" processed.  I doubt that Repertoire had acess to the original master tapes.  Capitol records just relesed a 24 bit digitally remastered compilation of QMS under its \\"classic Masters\\" series with great liner notes at a budget price.  The remastered EDIT of \\"WHO DO YOU LOVE\\" on this CD (which is a tad longer than Rhino's edit on its 1991 \\"sons of Mercury\\") shows how good the entire \\"HT\\" CD COULD sound if Capitol remastered it using the ORIGINAL MASTER TAPES and 24 bit processing.  If you love this album, you should demand that Capitol properly remaster it.  My numerous e-mails over several months to Capitol Records, CapitolMastering and... have all gone unasnwered.  Maybe if a few more fans requested a proper remaster of this CD, as well as decent liner notes, we could all enjoy the full version of \\"WDYL\\" the way it was meant to be heard.  The major record labels wonder why their sales are down why many consumers feel no guilt for downloading free MP3 files instead of buying CD's; maybe if labels such as Capitol stopped ignoring their customers, they would fare better.  I would gladly pay upto ($$$) dollars for a deluxe edition of this CD.  But who's listening?
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is amazing. I liked Coldplays previous albums but with this one, it seems they got it right. Songs like Daylight, and Green eyes are that beat u can hum too. The Scientist has given me chills everytime I listen to it. Not to metion the other songs. This cd is amazing and I seriously can't get enough of it. Each songs has a meaning and if you listen to the words, u seriously get chills. I def. recommended this album to anyone.
B00003OSSL|4.0|Great movie, super acting, rugged story.  The plot starts in one of those improbable and tragic twists of fate that leaves two relatively naive spouses suddenly window/widower.  And for awhile their pain gets worse as they discover that although they'd never met, their spouses were lovers.<br />I like \\"they lived happily ever after\\" movies, but this isn't one of them.  Nevertheless, the ending is real and the path of emotional ups, downs, frustrations and victories for Ford and Scott Thomas leaves the viewer with a feeling of substantial healing without a phony fairytale ending.<br />A little longer movie than some, and not for the cell-phone, swizzle-stick crowd as the priorities of the faster, better, bigger, louder crowd are subtly scorned as the pair learns to cherish what is truly important in the present - not in the future, or the past.  Well worth watching, particularly in view Random Heart's minimal endorsement but the movie critics - since I rarely agree with `em, that's a vote of confidence in my book.
B00006FXB6|5.0|You'd be hard pressed to find a modern band thoroughly unconcerned with image, style or marketing willing to devote itself solely to music. Queens of the Stone Age fit the bill and then some, creating an organic musical collective that has released three unique albums in four years. Songs For The Deaf has further refined the sound hinted at on the debut album and fleshed out on the sophmore release, combining disparate elements that coalesce into an unmistakable sound.<br />It's no mean feat that this band has recorded a record featuring four different lead vocalists that maintains a consistent tone throughout. Juxtaposing the hoarse screams of Nick Oliveri, the smooth melodic tones of Josh Homme, Mark Lanegan's dark growl and Dean Ween's playful, folky voice could have made for an album that sounded more like a compilation or a soundtrack... but it didn't. QotSA harkens back to an era where musicians collaborated freely and created music out of a community.<br />Putting aside the methods involved, Songs For The Deaf absolutely rocks. It's beholden to no single genre, combining punk, pop and psychedelia in a mortar and pestle and grinding it all to a fine, intoxicating concoction. One important aspect is flow: many bands fine-tune their album's song sequence, but few succeed in creating a true continuity without sacrificing variety. From the bombastic first track to the mellow closer, herein lies a stunning, entrancing hour of music.<br />And yes, that is ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl bashing away at the drums. If you think his inclusion was merely genius marketing, you probably didn't know he's been friendly with the band for nearly a decade. <br />To be honest, there is one aspect of the album some may not like, but it comes as no surprise to fans of Josh Homme's previous band Kyuss: The tracks are occasionally buffered by mindless radio-DJ prattle which is at best forgettable and at worst slightly irritating. Although the choice was described as an attempt to tiethe songs into a cohesive whole, it strikes me as a joke, similar to the Kyuss album whose 9 songs were pressed to CD as three tracks. It's this playful quality, however, which ever endears me to the band. Anything that recalls an era in which music was about fun and expression (as opposed to image and emoting) makes my ears smile.
B00005221M|5.0|I used to ask different people who had read Cooper's novel how close the Michael Mann film was true to the original.  Some people said it was right on the mark, while others said it wasn't even close.  So finally, I resolved to read the book  and find out for myself.  The answer to my question is that the film is somewhere in between the two extremes.<br />There are many ELEMENTS of Cooper's novel scattered throughout in the film.  The chronology of events is changed around somewhat, as are the alignments of romantic love affairs.  The spectacular scenery is exactly as depicted in the novel.  All of the major characters in the book are present in the film, save the musician David Gamut.  The greatest liberties taken by the movie involve the character of Duncan Heyward.<br />The casting in this movie is exceptional.  As I was reading Cooper's book, the faces of Madeline Stowe, Daniel Day Lewis &amp; all came to my mind as I was reading of the sundry personages presented in the text.  This may sound logical, as I saw the movie first.  However, directors do not always follow the depictions of characters when making film versions.  In this case, Michael Mann &amp; the casting department fit Cooper's presentations to a &quot;T.&quot;<br />Probably the best example of where the film &amp; book agree is in the massacre of Fort William Henry by the Huron Indians [an actual historical event].  However, the novel captures with more veracity the way in which general Montcalm lost control of his Indian Allies and was unable to prevent their breaching the treaty of surrender.<br />If you are looking for a visual feast of filmmaking, you can do much worse than this one.  The acting, direction and screenplay are immaculate, and the soundtrack is absorbing.  Here is your best chance to travel back in time to the fierce years of the French and Indian war.  For those who have the ambition, the book is highly recommended as well.
0312979479|5.0|Dame Agatha makes a jarring departure in this grim and intricate tale.  There is no sleuth, the pace is fast, frenzied and breathless, and rather than \\"types,\\" she takes pains with characterizations.  The body count is high, and the mode of death frequently untidy.  \\"And Then There Were None\\" is among the most favored of Christie's books.  It has gone through a few title changes; I knew it as \\"Ten Little Indians,\\" and before that it had even a more politically incorrect title.  Be forewarned, Ms. Christie is neither enlightened nor tolerant. Some of the passages and references are bigoted and might offend some readers.<br />A group of ten strangers is invited or hired for a long weekend on Indian Island, a mile off the Devon coast.  It is somewhat improbable that these ten would all accept such a vague invitation from a host they do not know to a place they have never seen before, but each for his or her own reasons accepts.  They include a doctor, a games mistress, a soldier of fortune, a rich playboy, a retired policeman, a judge, a spinster, a retired general and a married couple who are to be the servants.  They arrive on a bleak rocky island to a completely modern house with all the amenities.  The fires are welcoming, there is an ample supply of food, the servants are impeccable, but their host is absent.  In each of the bedrooms, the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme is posted on a prominent wall.  It begins:<br />\\"Ten Little Indian boys went out to dine;<br />One choked his little self, and then there were nine.---<br />Drinks are served, and one guest chokes, turns blue and falls over dead.  The tension builds, the fright of the stranded people is palpable as one by one, they are picked off, each in accordance with the nursery rhyme. As the number of victims increase, the survivors' suspicions of each other reach a frantic pitch.  In an epilogue, the police arrive and find them all dead.  Who is the murderer who has to be among the victims?<br />\\"And Then There Were None\\" is told in short choppy chapters that build suspense and tension.  I would call this Christie's one and only thriller.  None of the characters are even likable and once again (see \\"ABC Murders\\"), Christie toys with the idea of the serial killer long before such an animal was even heard of.  She is a good profiler too!  This is an excellent story, and the author is miles ahead of you at all times, If you can figure out \\"who\\" and \\"how\\" before she lays it out for you, you deserve the Sleuth of the Year Award!re Were None\\" is told in short choppy chapters that build suspense and tension.

B00005JKLZ|4.0|Entertaining and fresh time-travel idea but the ending is abrupt and a bit disappointing. It's almost as if they ran out of money and tried to wrap it all up as fast as they could. It's about a scientist who discovered the secret of time travelling after a tragedy, and it involves both moving back in time and forward.  You get a glimps of the past, the future, and the future beyond that.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Yes, this is an all time classic album. In the same manner as Jane's Addiction &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual&quot; album. Some may just not get into the sound, atleast at first. For me the poetic, fluctuating speed and conscious lyrics along with the tight punk, yet melodic music hit me the first time around.
B0000062GE|5.0|This has to be one of the most creative and depressing albums out there. Stabbing Westward has done some great work into this album with the voclas, of the guitars, to writing the songs!! Every track on the album is filled with such emotions you can't stop wondering how are you going to get by without this album. Darkest Days is just AMAZING.......actually words can't describe how i feel about this album only my emotions can.
B00005R23S|5.0|The DVD makes you feel like you're there again...and for me that's very special. Having been upgraded to the front, I can actually be seen in the video, waving my yellow sign which reads &quot;thanks Bruuuuuce!&quot;...the sound quality is amazing, and if you have a large screen TV, its truly like re-living the performance. If you are a Bruce fan, and haven't added this title to your collection, you've gotta order this DVD.
B00005B36H|4.0|this is a great album..one of the best rock albums of 2001. there are some great songs. my recommendations : &quot;ticks and leeches&quot; and &quot;schism&quot;...my pick for tool is their &quot;undertow&quot; album, but come on peoples..you need to buy this! you won't regret it!
B0000636UN|5.0|This is an AWESOME cd!  The music itself is outstanding, and the lyrics are intelligent, sometimes sarcastic, but overall very thoughtful.  Let's take a look at the songs:<BR>1: Steve McQueen- The only problem with this song is that it contains the only profanity on the album.  However, this is one of my favorite songs.  It is very well written and executed and I especially like the lyric &quot;we've got rockstars in the white house and all our pop stars look like porn.&quot; Because we all know that it's just too true.<BR>2: Soak up the Sun-You've probably heard this on the radio...It's light and airy, a very good song, another one of my favorites.<BR>3:You're an Original-This is what I mean by intelligent lyrics. An interesting song.<BR>4-Safe and Sound-The chorus is kind of screechy, but not it's not awful.<BR>5: C'mon C'mon-The title track is definitely one of the best on the whole album.  It's very catchy.<BR>6: It's so Easy-Duet with Don Henley could be improved.  The beginning is kind of sparse with just a few piano chords and vocals, but the song is well written.<BR>7: Over You-This is a very good song...very practical because I mean, come on, everyone feels this way at least once in life.<BR>8: Lucky Kid-I don't understand why this song isn't called Wasted.<BR>9: Diamond Road-I LOVE this song!  &quot;Life is what happens while you're making plans, everything that you need is right here in your hands.&quot;<BR>10: It's Only Love-This is another catchy, thoughtfully written song.  Very good.<BR>11: Abilene- This song is really good.  It's about how she's helping someone who's been hurt-&quot;Broken promises are no worse than words never said.&quot;<BR>12: Hole in My Pocket-I think that this is my favorite song on this cd.  It's soo good!<BR>13: Weather Channel-Kind of slow, with no chorus, but it's HAUNTING.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Wow, this record rocks.  I was reeling by the fifth song.  These guys were already a big, greasy slab of churning riffs, but now add a pinch of Dave Grohl behind the kit & you have nothing short of a trip-hammering, mind-numbing aural assault.  And, as if all this weren't enough, QOTSA also includes Mark Lannegan (late of Screaming Trees) to add a little bluesy, frayed edge to some of the tunes.  It all adds up to a late-summer surge of molten raa  Let the burning begin.
0767819659|5.0|Our 4-year old enjoyed it, with a little explanation in order about Miss Clavel's habit, and about the motives of the kidnappers.<br />A very nice extra on the DVD is an old 1952 animated short based closely on the original Bemelmans book, with the text and cartoon style nearly identical. Amusingly, Miss Clavel is therein depicted as a sort of governess, rather than as a nun; perhaps a sign of the times, or maybe the cartoon's producers were not Catholic?<br />I thought Hatty Jones did great in the title role -- wonder what ever happened to her?
B00006GA48|5.0|The Grand Funk Railroad was a band that constantly reinvented themselves, almost with each album. At the beginning there were considered a Heavy Metal band (White Noise) of course even that part of there career has been reclassified as classic hard rock because of what Metal music has advanced too but it cannot be said that GFR is at least not a grandfather of Heavy Metal. GFRs first two albums On Time and Grand Funk (what we GFR Fanatics call The Red Album) were extremely heavy and somewhat simplistic (also GREAT). So when Closer To Home Came out it singled a change. Now this &quot;heavy Metal Band&quot; is showing the ability to change and showing versatility and more sophisticated lyrics. Closer to home is more of a blues based album there GFRs pervious efforts and It also contains GFR magus Opus (Best song) in my opinion I'm Your Captain Closer To Home. Its wonderful song and singer Songwriter Mark Farner said it came to him in a dream and that he believe God gave him this song to be meaningful to people. It has been meaningful to me for over 30 years now and to millions of others as well. The song is just a beautiful blend of melodic Guitar chords (Mark Farner) a great lead bass line (Mel Schacher) and wonderful drumming along (Don Brewer) with great lead vocals by Mark and wonderful Harmonies between Mark and Don, take all that and include a great orchestra blended and you have an all time rock classic. Closer to Home is worth the price just for I'm Your Captain Closer To Home alone, but that is not all. This album is great from start to finish. Sin's a Good Man's Brother is a hard rocker with an infectious groove. Aimless Lady a cool Bluesy rocker. Nothing is the same showed more sophistication in lyric writing for the young band and it rocks as well. Mean Mistreater and is slow down for the band a bluesy song crying out for lost love. Get it together is a fun (mostly) instrumental a nice grove provided by the rhythm section and some nice guitar chops at the end. Hooked On Love has that Gospel feel that influences much rock n roll from the 60s and early 70s, a typical we got to have Love song and a very good one. And I'm Your Captian/Closer to home which is GFRs magus opus as I said previously. IYC/CTH is one of rock n rolls classic songs and its simply a beautiful songs. Coming form GFR such a heavy band at the time it was a big surprise. Now this new version of CD comes 24 bit remastered and sound absolutely wonderful and included is new liner notes, photos and bonus tracks. The Bonus tracks are worth the price of the CD alone. An Alternate mix of Mean Mistreater. And three excellent Live Rockers, In Need Heartbreaker and Men Misterater all from the power trios prime performances. This album shows GFR still with gritty power but also shows striking maturity for the three young man, Mel, Don and Mark. This is one of Rock N Roll's classic hard rock album by one of Classic Rock's best bands. I would recommend this album to any hard rock/rock fan and any metal fan who wants to see the beginnings of modern hard rock and metal. And if you have any previous edition of this CD, Get this one, The sound of the 24 bit remastering and the bonus tracks will blow you away.end.

B00003CXRM|3.0|... whoever produced the DVD fixed somethin' that weren't broke by deleting the Welch/Krauss rendition of \\"I'll fly away\\", that hair-raisin' duet with full bluegrass backup that got everybody all a-lather. They dubbed in some generic back-porch ensemble instead, and my ears near fell off from surprise.<br />The pinch-hit group do just okay, and I'm not slamming their artistry, but their music was not what I'd expected or paid for. At least Ms. Welch's acting cameo stayed in.<br />I wish they'd checked the copyright wonks and IP lawyers at the door when they did the DVD. This edition is okay but just beware that it's NOT what you saw or heard in the theater, and IMO is a misleading and inferior product. A pity that opened DVDs are generally non-returnable.
B00006GA4C|5.0|RED ALBUM was THE GRAND FUNK RAILROAD in all their raw, nasty, sexual, high energy, Live sounding Power Trio madness. This is a Great second Album surpassing there great debut On Time, and helps rank GFR with the Great's of the 70s like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. This album was recorded live and the only overdubs are putting some rhythm guitar where the leads are (al of GFRs Terry Knight Produced were done the same way, as fast as possible and No Frills). Like On Time its a sledge hammer album, but even heavier with the smash songs that GFR used live such as In Need, Inside Looking Out and Paranoid. Red Album which is what we GFR fanatics call Grand Funk, also has the radio friendly songs Mr. Limousine Driver, Please Don't worry, and High Falottin Women. As well as the Sledge hammer rocker Got This Thing On The Move. This was what GFR was all about, Mel Schacher Playing his BOOMING BASS behind the note. Don Brewer Playing his POUNDING DRUMS ahead of the Note and Mark Farner playing his wild rhythms and screeching leads on GUITAR anywhere; before, after, or in the middle of the note. Or to be more accurate Don playing at the beginning of the note, Mel playing at the end of the note and Mark going wherever he wants with his wild rhythms. This sound made GFR something unique and special and gave them a driven sound that made you feel like your moving. Don and Mark do great Harmonies and both are excellent lead singers as well. Red Album is a special album every hard rock fan should have in there collection. GFRs sound can't be faked or copied, its something natural to the three musicians. This album along with Live, On Time, and Closer To Home, captured millions of fans for GFR who still reminisce about these albums to this day. This edition of RED ALBUM the CD is 24 Bit remastered with New liner Notes, Bonus Tracks, and photos. The Bonus tracks are a demo version of Nothing is the same and an extended version of Mr. Limousine Driver and there very cool. This is the first Time Capitol has released Red Album on CD in the USA and is a must have CD for every GFR fan and Every fan of Hard Rock. Is there someone standing Just out side your door?<br />RickDC :)ol.

B000002LGA|4.0|Lou Reed is one of Rock's few real poets and this recording takes a hard but loving look at NYC. &quot;Halloween Parade&quot; speaks of the losses caused by Aids with a wistful voice that allows the listener to share in those lossses and be touched by them. &quot;Dirty Blvd.&quot; and &quot;Endless Cycle&quot; cries out for children suffering at the hands of those who should protect them. Homeless vets (&quot;Christmas in February&quot;, street romance (&quot;Romeo had Juliette), and the chaos of New York in the 80's (&quot;Hold On&quot;) are all parts of Reed's New York mosaic. There are hopeful songs as well (&quot;beginning of a Great Adventure&quot; &quot;Busload of Faith&quot;) that gives a glimpse of a better future.<BR>    So why not 5 stars? Well Lou has a tendency to get a little preachy. The topical material like &quot;Good Evening, Mr. Waldheim&quot; which blasts Waldheim, The Pope, Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson and the PLO comes across as whine and more than a bit self-involved and &quot;Sick of You&quot; which rants against a number of things is just tedious...I guess I just get &quot;Sick of It.&quot; (Sorry)&quot;The Last Great American Whale&quot; attempts to be a new myth but just seems endless. If 4 1/2 stars were an option I'd go that high but I feel in this case I'd rather round down. NEW YORK shows Reed at his best most of the time but the lows drag it down.

0802130208|5.0|No need to recap plot as there are over 500 other reviews here for that. I just wanted to throw in my two cents. <br />\\"Dunces\\" is a wild ride through the wacky New Orleans of the early 1960s. The dialogue of certain characters (Jones, Irene, Santa)  approaches Twain in its ability to recreate Southern dialect. It's odd though that Ignatius several times disparages Twain as a writer, I wonder what's behind this criticism? Ignatius is a wonderful character, a true misanthropist that others with even a hint of misanthropy in their hearts will take to. I even found myself feeling sorry for the big dope in his isolation from society. The depiction of blacks and gays is so un-PC that it's refreshingly hilarious to read in today's times. <br />However, the ending was a little disappointing in the way that all of the storylines were wrapped up with a happy outcome. Given the bleak tone of the book, the ending felt false. These characters deserved a more ironic fate. That said, I am still kinda glad that all of the heroes do live happily ever after.

B00004T40X|5.0|When I was first introduced to European power metal, I wasn't that impressed (my preference was for American power metal bands like Iced Earth).  In the beginning I dismissed most of the bands.  I didn't like the speed coupled with the often cheesy lyrics and saccharine vocal melodies.  However, I did eventually warm up to some European power metal bands.  First, it was Stratovarius and Balance of Power.  Later, it was bands like Rhapsody, Silent Force and Kamelot (though three-fourths of the band are Americans, Kamelot is definitely European power metal in style).  I began to like the genre, even though European power metal began to stagnate a bit by the turn of the century.  Too many European power metal bands were sounding too much alike.  With a few notable exceptions, there was a certain level of sameness prevalent throughout the Euro power metal medium and I began to tire of the genre.  Enter Sonata Arctica.<br />Sonata Arctica surprised just about everyone when they released their debut album, Ecliptica, in 1999.  Though Sonata Arctica didn't wow everyone with their originality-they were following Stratovarius's Helloween/Malmsteen influenced power metal blueprint very closely-they still managed to stun the metal world with outstanding musicianship and absolutely beautiful vocal melodies.  In fact, the vocal melodies on Ecliptica are so gorgeous and catchy, I think Sonata Arctica outshines their predecessor, Stratovarius, in their consistency when it comes to writing catchy songs.  I don't believe any one Stratovarius disc is, overall, as unfailing in the vocal melody department as Sonata Arctica is on Ecliptica.  To put it bluntly, Sonata Arctica does Stratovarius better than Stratovarius does!  Yes, Sonata Arctica is that good!<br />The first track, \\"Blank File\\", is Euro power metal perfection as speedy guitar and catchy vocal melodies intertwine beautifully <BR>reminding me of some songs by Stratovarius (\\"Black Diamond\\" comes to mind).  Not as fast as track one, \\"My Land\\" boasts some fabulous vocal melodies and crunchy guitar work.  \\"8th Commandment\\" is fast, furious and unforgettable-this song will stay in your head long after you've listened to it.  \\"Replica\\" is a semi-ballad that tells the story of a returning war veteran who can't re-assimilate into society.  Perhaps this is odd subject matter for a Euro power metal band to be covering, but the song works and it's even touching.  The fifth track, \\"Kingdom for a Heart\\" is possibly the best Euro power metal song I've ever heard.  It is extremely fast and catchy and I'll never get this song out of my head!  \\"FullMoon\\" starts off with a quiet piano and soon becomes an excellent rocker.  \\"Letter to Dana\\" is a powerful, sweeping Irish ballad.  You read that right: An Irish ballad.  I don't know what a power metal band from Finland is doing writing Irish ballads but I'm glad they did.  \\"Letter to Dana\\" is a song about hope, missed chances and innocence lost.  Cliched, perhaps, but the emotional performance of vocalist Tony Kakko and the fabulous lead guitar work pull you into the story.  Unbelievable.  Sonata Arctica may worship Stratovarius, but \\"Letter to Dana\\" shows us that they are no mere Stratovarius clones.  \\"UnOpened\\" marks the return to Stratovarius-like songs as it moves at blinding speed.  \\"Picturing the Past\\" is another classically-styled power metal speedster that will stay in my head until my death. Finally, the album closes with the fantastic and epic \\"Destruction Preventer\\" which again boasts stunning vocal melodies and lightning fast guitar playing.<br />Though Stratovarius is clearly the band's main influence on this album, Sonata Arctica doesn't just mindlessly ape their power metal forefathers as they do a masterful job of crafting truly memorable songs.  \\"Kingdom for a Heart\\", \\"Letter to Dana\\" and \\"Destruction Preventer\\" are exceptional songs on an album where every track stands out.  Vocalist/keyboardist Tony Kakko wrote Ecliptica and his ability to come up with outstandingly beautiful vocal melodies without sounding sappy is a gift.  Like the band Shadow Gallery, Tony Kako is able to write vocal melodies that are catchy yet unpredictable.  This makes Ecliptica the best European power metal album I've ever heard.  <BR>Keep it up, Sonata Arctica, you're doing fine thus far.
B00006FXB6|4.0|The first stuff on this album is a satirical attck on the now entirely commercial radio world.  All of the songs are unbelievable, I think one is about september eleventh.  The queens aren't afraid to rock in ways that have lately been sniveled at by indie snobs, who don't have jobs.  The Queens of the Stone Age pay open homage to seventies metal more than ever.  This album refrences Zeppelin's Four Sticks and That's the Way, Sabbath's Supernaut, Am I going insane and Changes, and Blue Oyster Cult's Mistress of the Salmon Salt.  I think you have to be deaf to hear the next to last song.
B0000033OZ|4.0|After a brief stint with The Nice, King Crimson and Atomic Rooster, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer were now ready to take flight, and achieved it in grand fashion on this, their self-titled 1970 debut release. The world would get a healthy dose of ELP's wholesome, technically sound progressive-rock artistries (on this and future ELP efforts), all of which are homogenically and proudly displayed on the opening track, the lone instrumental \\"The Barbarian\\". Lake's soaring buzz guitar starts this track off on its merry way, with Emerson and Palmer chiming in with a keyboard and drum clinic soon afterward. The musical tempo then spirals downward just a bit at the beginning of \\"Take A Pebble\\", with Lake adding a Crimson-esque touch to his soft, velvet-like vocal delivery. ELP displays an all-out musical assault on the ears on \\"Knife-Edge\\", as these three diverse and talented musicians pull out every musical variation neatly housed in their well-tuned arsenal, courtesy of Lake's rhythmic, bottom-heavy bass, Emerson's upscale keyboard/piano harmonies and Palmer's stormy, cutting-edge style drumming. Much of this same musical craftsmanship is carried over into the \\"Three Fates: Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos\\" suite, although both the lyrical and intrumental qualities ELP would present on future suites on following albums would appear to be a tad more developing and insightful (\\"Karn Evil #9\\" from the explosive \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" being a prime example). The \\"Three Fates\\" suite is still very hook-laden, as it sports many different musical styles, with several artistic hooks to keep even the most die-hard ELP fanatic entertained for hours on end. \\"Tank\\" is yet another superb piece of explorative art from the group, and doesn't \\"tank\\" in the process. \\"Emerson Lake & Palmer\\" ends with the tediously poppy, yet enjoyable, \\"Lucky Man\\", ELP's first (and perhaps only) U.S. Top 40 hit single. This track goes off on its own unique veritable artistic tangent (courtesy of Emerson's keyboards and Moog synthesizer), which saves it from being a total commercial disaster (which it isn't). Overall, there's much pleasure to be had from ELP's debut, even though this soon-to-be supergroup would dig deeper into their creative progressive portfolio on their next release \\"Tarkus\\" and beyond. \\"Tarkus\\" would prove to be the effort that put Emerson, Lake and Palmer on the musical map, but, as for the case with their self-titled debut, ELP had to start somewhere, and what a beginning this release truly was, and still is! So, like the eagle on the cover, \\"fly\\" on down to your local retailer today, and pick this one up.

B000068PQ0|4.0|This is one of three projects The Flaming Lips have been working on over the past couple of years.  The others are the unreleased soundtracks for 'Christmas on Mars' and 'The Southern Oklahoma Cosmic Trigger Contest'.  Makes me wonder what would have happened had they devoted all of their energy into a single project.<br />'Fight Test' and 'Yoshimi Battles...Part 1' rank up there with the best songs the band has ever done (which I maintain are 'Guy Who Got A Headache And Accidentally Saves The World' and 'Waitin' For Superman').  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is hit or miss.  'Yoshimi Part 2' is already getting the 'skip' treatment and I find myself wondering what to listen to next about the time I get to 'Do You Realize'.<br />'Fight Test' doesn't seem to fit the techno-futuristic theme of the album but it's easily one of the best songs they have ever done.  With emotional and accessible lyrics, a great electronicly induced beat and a chorus that I can't stop singing in my head I do believe we're looking at a finalist for &quot;Best Song of 2002 That You Won't Hear on the Radio&quot;.<br />'Yoshimi Battles...Part 1' is a lot of layered fun that you can sing along with.<br />The bottom line: It's not the masterpiece I think they could have made but it's quite enjoyable and I don't regret buying it one bit.  The merely curious should probably start with The Soft Bulletin but those with any past pleasant experience shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.

Daphne Du Maurier definitely knows the English language and how to put sentences and paragraphs together that flow and develop the story and characters.  She seems to choose the perfect words and best writing style to build to the right atmosphere for every situation in the book.

B000069HKH|5.0|When of the great questions is can artists who wear their working class roots on their sleeve make great music once they get fabulously wealthy from their art? Or can a rock star make great albums more than a quarter century after their peak?<br />The answer is a resounding &quot;YES&quot; if the artist is &quot;Da Boss&quot; AND he has something heavy on his heart. &quot;The Rising&quot; is one of Bruce Springsteen's best albums. September 11th does hover over this album, yet it is jubilant at times (Mary's Place). The version of &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; could be used in a Mass, &quot;You're Missing&quot; invokes a feeling of what it must of been like for the families of the dead in the aftermath of the attacks. <br />It's also an album of someone struggling with faith, feelings and sorrow. It rings true to the heart. Of the major rock acts of the past quarter century, maybe ever, only Springsteen and U2 can make you wonder,  question and rejoice in faith AND get played on mainstream radio and TV. <br />Get this album, you will not regret it.

At times I had to stop and take a rest, the emotions were so strong.  <br />Sebold is an incredible writer, and has written us a world we can all feel at home in, and yet wish we had the power to change the past.  Her heroine grows and matures (quite a feat for a dead girl) and we love her.  Her family also grows and matures, as seen through her eyes.  The unique perspective is what holds this together for me- she observes everyone, and has the background to make us understand their motives, and how it affects her. And, unlike many concept books, the narrator from Heaven concept does not wear thin, and she has written a great ending that fits the story perfectly.  Rather nice in this day of [poor] endings. <br />This could easily be a chick book (and will probably be a chick flick soon enough), but it isn't.

6304230109|5.0|this video is amazing.  they showcase their most beautiful songs in acoustic, orchestral brilliance.  i'm not too sure how to write a review for this.  on one hand, it's by far the most wonderful music ever made (definetely up there with nirvana).  i never get tired of hearing this and other AIC music.  the production is great.  crisp and clear.  they play astoundingly well for a band that hadn't been doing concerts in a while.  layne's voice, although strained at times, comes off just as it is intended.  so much pain, agony, and beauty in one place at one time.  the lyrics are so true and from the heart, whether the literal of persoanl figurative meaning.  <br />it killed me to see layne in such bad shape in this video.  you can see it in his eyes.  he's got this look like he's wishing he had a heroin fix right there while they were playing.  it's quite sad.  <br />i was just recently thinking maybe he got over it.  maybe someone stepped in, and being thru with AIC meant he might be thru with his drugs.  seeing as how a nirvana-reunion is \\"out of the question\\", i was hoping for an AIC reunion tour.  and now it will never happen.  it disgusts me that they let layne die like he did.  for almost two decades he had a drug problem, and no one helped him.  i'm sure he got pep-talks from friends and families, but no one helped him.  look what happened to kurt.  it was inevitable.  someone should have done something.  what a horrible loss.  this video is an anti-drug commercial in itself.  look what we lost.  who knows what we missed?  it really ruins the video for me.  i'd love to just watch it for the musical and artistical value, but all i can think is how he ended up.  <br />anyway, this movie really does show just what AIC could do.  in their own worst of times, they made the best music of my generation.  i have yet to see any band messure up.  get this video.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay by no means has hit a sophmore slump.  This album  is solid and mature from start to finish.  It also has a few more rocky tracks on it which is a nice touch.  I rarely like albums the first listen through; however, this one was a ride, a good ride from play to stop.  Everyone has classic albums in their collection, but they always came out a few years ago and make the owner prone to nostalgia.  Its always extremely hard to buy a classic album when it comes out.  This one feels classic, it feels so solid that hit, 5 stars, is written all over it.  Parahutes was a good debut but it seemed unfished.  Some of the later tracks on the album seemed unfinished, especially the 45 sec title track.  Infact the only thing that gets me past Trouble is the epic Everythings Not Lost.  All of this albums songs are totally realized and full in their production.  This is an extremely good follow up, that should and most likely will be a classic.

B0000648WZ|3.0|Machine guns and grenade launchers were used to get rid of bugs. Why couldn't they have used Raid or Black Flag? Those sprays would've been more effective than a whole bunch of bullets. Especially if there's a bug spraying junk from its stern and spitting fire on things. Just throw in a case of Raid into its body and then watch the fireworks. Watch the movie for its action sequences and forget the story. Thanks for the stupid commercials. If I wanted to see dumb commercials, I would have watched late night tv. Bloopers, girls gone crazy, etc. \\"A good bug is a dead bug.\\" That's for sure. You should see the ant trails crawling onto my pizza. Stinkin' bugs. My poor dog even has flies buzzing around her head even after she took a bath! \\"Starship Troopers\\" isn't Paul Verhoeven's best because he'll never top Lord Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"Total Recall\\". Although it has just as bad acting as \\"Showgirls,\\" the film has dazzling special effects. Check out Denise Richards and Dina Meyer. Remember Meyer worked with Dolph Lordgren in \\"Johnny Mnemonic.\\" The planet goes to war with bugs and Doogie Howser reads the mother bug's mind. Yes, no. Pretty good movie.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters is no doubt,a musical genius and I believe the best songwriter that ever rock the music. His song writing skills show us why Pink Floyd was such as amazing band of modern times. However,Amused to Death, is a masterpiece of Roger Waters! This album is far better than Darkside of the moon & The Wall album.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Scientists have played the role of God and recreated dinosaurs with old fossils. Too bad they couldn't do something more resourceful by finding cures to diseases. Man! Oh well, the most brilliant people in the country flock to Jurassic Park to be the first to walk through the park. Everything seems fine and dandy at first, but a big, fat jerk tries to steal D.N.A. samples to sell it to a smuggler. He ruins everything because he's not in shape and the dinosaurs break out of their quadrants. A Tyrannosaurus Rex eats a guy off of a toilet, chases a speeding jeep, and then eats other dinosaurs/animals. What's the matter kid? You don't like lamb chops? Little Timmy is smarter than the adults. Alan Grant doesn't like children, I can see why. Ian Malcolm talks funny and he looks like my friend. Too bad they didn't use Arnold Schwarzenegger to save the day. Can you imagine? However, Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing and fans won't be disappointed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have never seen war. But after viewing this classic series, I feel as if I have seen it now. I have seen it through the eyes and hearts of a cast of characters that I will never forget. This is the greatest war film I have ever seen. It eclipses my previous favorite, the old black and white classic All Quiet On The Western Front. Band of Brothers is, by it's very nature, an unblinking look into the horror that is war, and can only be considered an anti-war film. It does not betray it's cast, it honors them. It abhors that which has brought them together in their moments of greatness. It abhors war. There is no honor in dying, only in loyalty and the ability to survive. Every American should be required to see this any time one of our Presidents start strutting around and preparing themselves to lead us into their version of the next Holy Crusade. It is time we learned as a people that there is no such thing.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Shoot! NAS! Dom (Vin Diesel) is the only cool person in this movie. You can forget about the undercover cop who's trying to find the street racers who steal expensive video equipment. He definitely needs a shower. Even Dom's sister (Jordana Brewster) said he needed one. Smelly fool. The races are good and Dom beats up a guy at Race Wars. Pretty funny stuff. Michelle Rodriguez beats up some guys for no reason. Almost a lordess. Remember, it DON'T matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winnin's winning.
1587990717|2.0|Taleb claims in the introduction that he wrote the book without doing any library research.  Believe the man.<br />The overall subject of the book is interesting, and the author makes some good points here and there.  However, he doesn't support his points with many references or specific examples.  The book is disorganized and rambling, and Taleb often raises subjects without really explaining them thoroughly.  If I didn't already know about the demise of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), then Taleb's comments on this topic would have left me scratching my head.<br />Taleb also irritates with his constant name-dropping and providing irrelevant, personal details about the people he describes.<br />Avoid this book, unless Taleb gets a good editor and comes out with a heavily revised edition.
B00000JKH2|5.0|...simply amazing. This EP by at the drive-in is what music is all about. Seven stunning tracks that range from questioning ones habits with lyrics like \\"what if forensic finds the answers? what if they stole my finger prints? where did I leave that book of matches? we'll find you!(metronome arthritis) to drug induced explosions like \\"increase the dosage count down from 10\\". I loved all of them. If they included a few more tracks(it was only a seven song EP) it would be my favorite at the drive-in CD to date. I hope and pray they will carry the legacy on in mars volta.
B000065V3M|5.0|There is so much garbage put out on DVDs these days (for example anything with Adam Sandler or Lucille Ball), why don't they release this classic movie?
B000002NHN|5.0|If you have been referred to the music of Loreena McKennitt because you have expressed a liking for Enya, you should know that McKennitt makes Enya sound like background music by comparison.  Fulfilling, not betraying, the Celtic, Middle Eastern and medieval inspirations behind her music, she makes everything she performs an original piece of art.  She is one of the few serious singer-songwriters who gives full expression to the dramatic promise in her music without sounding overproduced or affected or sentimental. Every note is honest and &quot;there.&quot; She never disappears behind the high quality instrumental accompaniment.  My personal favorite on this album is &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; that poem we learned in grade school.  With a gradually building, chilling fury, she brings out the emotional impact of the story, one that was lost in the relentless classroom emphasis on the rhythm, rhyme and memorization. Her diction is impeccable. THE BOOK OF SECRETS is my favorite of her albums, largely because of &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; but her other work, like THE MASK AND THE MIRROR is also worthy of attention.
0920668372|5.0|I got this book for my son when he was 3.  It became a bedtime favorite and if I didn't read it I had to at least sing the song EVERY NIGHT. He is now 13 and when his little brother came on to the scene a few months ago he went to his bookcase and pulled this book out and had me read it to his brother. ( he has kept his copy.)He has even adjusted the words of the song to fit him and his little brother.  The impact of knowing what ever you do your mom will still be your mom (or big brother) and love you is a strong message.
B00006690G|5.0|Love him or hate him, Eminem has managed to steal the spotlight of America and keep it on him. The beats on the songs of this album are the best yet. You can hardly tell the songs Dre produced from the ones Em did. His lyrics that accompany the best beats in rap are somewhat similar to the last album. However, The Eminem Show seems to be more of a personal album than the Marshall Mathers LP, which was shot after shot at Eminem's critics.<br />I had the opportunity to see Eminem perform live this last month, and it was an A plus performance. The man truely can rap. He has also managed to do something never before done, appeal to popular black culture and \\"white\\" suburban America. ... where he gets serious and tells us his stories of tribulation, who he is and how nothing will stop him.  \\"Square Dance,\\" \\"Soldier,\\" \\"Superman\\" and \\"'Till I Collapse.\\"<br />    This album gives you a strong feel and connection the way the first one did.  The best part of it all is that its the brutal honesty, wit and fact that separates him from every other rapper out there.<BR>    <BR>   Many of you may and probably will interpret each song in different ways and come up with your own opinions.  Whatever I guess.  The point is, we've definitely never seen this side of Shady and this one should not be overlooked.  Those of you who were disappointed with the last album will be quite pleased with this one.  The same goes for those of you that did like it  So buy it already!
B000069AUI|5.0|I liked their first disc, but thought it really didn't stand out THAT much from most of the Brit bands that came through at around the same time...(Travis, etc).  But this album proves that these guys are the real deal.  Excellent songs, no filler and the band (especially the lead singer) sound amazing.  If you liked the last one, you will LOVE this.  One of the best of 2002.
B00006FXB6|5.0|i've waited months for this album and the wait is over.. hell, i skipped work today in order to get it.. there i was, first in line at the record store, salivating as the all the red and black stared back at me.. i gladly paid the record store price for this gem of an album..<br />first track comes on slowly, then crunches like some fresh celery in your ear.. nick sounds great and with dave grohl on drums, the queens sound like a million bucks.. i'm too busy listening to write a detailed review, so i'll just give you the jist of it...<br />tracks 1-14 = genius<br />right now, i'm stuck on &quot;another love song&quot;, a new kind of pop song, the kind brian wilson would write if he weren't such a nutcase<br />you may have heard &quot;hanging tree&quot; from the Desert Sessions Vol. 7-8, and if not, it's your lucky day, great song...<br />also, all the between song banter is interesting, giving you the concept of the album.. what concept is it? well, buy the damn cd and find out.. well worth it...<br />p.s. i haven't even got to the dvd yet<br />you've been wonderful, thank you all
B000069AUI|5.0|Rarely have I gone as nuts for a band as I have for Coldplay.  When the British quartet's debut album, \\"Parachutes\\", came out, I was mesmerized by their hypnotic sound.  Not since Jeff Buckley had I heard a voice that resonated with such emotional depth.<br />Now with \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", Coldplay has managed to top themselves, and most every band out there.  Whereas \\"Parachutes\\" sounded like gifted amateurs finding their voice, this one is their maturing.  This is a fierce, emotional, powerful, important album that will undoubtedly become one of the best albums of the year (judging by some critics reviews, I am not off on that prediction).<br />The album starts off with \\"Politik\\", which instantly assaults you with its sweeping musicality.  The album never fails to impress throughout.  Highlights include my personal favorite \\"The Scientist\\" (perhaps their most beautiful work yet), the instantly catchy \\"Warning Sign\\", the moving title track, and the beautiful closing track \\"Amsterdam\\".<br />Coldplay burst out onto the music scene with their hit single \\"Yellow\\", which captured listeners with its sheer simplicity.  Here, the band flexes its musical muscles and takes a chance with a more complex approach, and they have passed with flying colors.<br />There have been rumors that this will be the band's last album.  If that is, in fact, true, the music world will be losing perhaps their most talented newcomer just as they were beginning to find out who they truly were.  However, they started off with a great album, ended with a truly remarkable album, and had nothing bad in between.  Even with only two albums, that is still quite the achievement.
B00004Z459|5.0|I had never heard of Linkin Park before they released this album and at the time I had never purchased an album in my life. I was totally into pop music like Westlife and da Spice Girls (ya I know Im cringin' at the thought of it myself!)as I actually had no knowledge of rock music of any kind so I stayed away from it. Then one day out of the blue I heard 'Crawling' on the radio and I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I was actually listenin to music that I could relate to and enjoy completely. I had no clue who Linkin Park were but I bought the album the day it was released here. I couldn't believe I was letting myself buy it only after bearly listening to one of their songs cause there is always the possibility that the whole album could be a total waste of money. But I was thoroughly blown away.<BR>Unreal is all I can say about. It is sooooooooo original and so uniquely remarkable it's frighting! They have an unbelievable talent and they are cetainly putting it to good use.<BR>Papercut is the first songon the 12 track album which comes to a total of 44 mins playing time which isn't too bad for a debut album really. This song is about the voices that we hear inside of us wen we are alone and sometimes wen wer not and the lads express their thoughts and feelings in a way that totally relates to young people today.<BR>One Step Closer is their first single and is the second song on the album. Excellent music. This song is more or less about a disfunctional relationship which everyone goes through at some stage in their lives.

B000067CPX|5.0|&quot;By The Way&quot; is a gorgeous CD. The Chilis are more mellow than in the past, but then again they are older and more mature than they were in the past.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.<br /><br />And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), \\"Monsters Inc\\" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best. It has brilliant animation, delightful characters (\\"Mike Wazowski!\\"), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.<br /><br />The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.<br /><br />The top Scarer is James P. \\"Sully\\" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.<br /><br />Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named \\"Boo\\") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.<br /><br />Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.<br /><br />The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?\\" \\"... painted?\\"). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).<br /><br />However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story --  Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it (\\"I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!\\").<br /><br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo (\\"One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!\\"). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.<br /><br />It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual \\"working joe\\" environment -- \\"Monsters Inc\\" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.nny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH!

B00005JL3A|1.0|since everyone is giving this good reviews i have to weigh in.first id have to say there was hardly any gore.the acting was painfully hard to watch.and ive never seen a zombie movie where the \\"hero\\" takes out the zombies barehanded  martial arts style.Im not even sure if this was supposed to be a horror movie or an action movie.but at any rate it was ...and i would avoid at all cost.it would have been so much beter with romero!
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I happened to get this CD and two other french soundtracks for homework from french class. AFter listening to this CD once, I became addicted and to this day, I barely opened the other two. the songs are absolutely delightful and I regret that I didn't get a chance to see the actual play. I love it.
B000001LKY|4.0|Released in 1975, the last LP from Hawkwind's first period (Robert Calvert would rejoin the following year, and steer the band into quite different territory).<br />The primal rawness of Space Ritual and Doremi have been partly replaced by textured soundscapes, largely courtesy of vioilinist/keyboardist Simon House. This trend was evident on the earlier (and better) Hall of the Mountain Grill, but is even more to the fore here. Don't be mistaken though. This album still pounds out fantastic prog metal. It just pounds it behind a massive wall of mellotrons, violins and oboes. And the whole thing is pulled off with far more conviction and credibility than, shall we say, Kansas ever managed. The best moments - Assault and Battery / The Golden Void, Magnu and most of the other 'songs' are stunning.<br />However, regrettably, this magnificence is undercut by four embarressing Michael Moorcock poetry pieces, spoken by Moorcock or Turner, while the band tinker around in the background bashing gongs and making silly noises. The poetry itself is pretty ludicrous, and the delivery just silly. If it weren't for these cringe-making interludes, Warrior would be a masterpiece. As it is, it's just a classic, overshadowed, in my opinion, by the earlier 'Hall of the Mountain Grill', and the later (very different) Calvert-era 'Quark Strangeness and Charm'
B00006FXB6|5.0|I was way ahead on the QOTSA, i got their album Rated R in 2000 after hearing the &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; at the Virgin Megastore...I was amazed, my favorite track off of the album was &quot;The Lost Art of Keeping A Secret&quot; which was actually the first single...After that album i searched for any others and found their self-titled debut which i have not gotten yet...Then in June of 2002 someone gave me a promo of their unreleased album &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;...I think my jaw dropped while hearing the cd...every track is a killer with guest's David Grohl's incredible drumming...Buy this and Rated R as soon as you can, and even if you're not a metal fan you'll be more than glad...
B000069HKH|4.0|Heavily marketed as Bruce Springsteen's first studio album with the E Street Band since 1984's \\"Born in the USA\\" and as Bruce's artistic response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, \\"The Rising\\" has a lot to live up to.  Bruce rises to the occasion and beyond, giving us not merely a brilliant \\"September 11\\" CD but one that faces living with losses of all sorts.  Even the songs that most directly address the terrorist attacks leave room for additional interpretations.  It's too soon to tell how \\"The Rising\\" will stand up over time, but its themes should be able to transcend one specific moment in American history.<br />Like most of Bruce's albums, \\"The Rising\\" is intended to be heard as a whole, and the whole is indeed greater than the sum of its parts.  Though not all songs are standouts, the effect is of turning a jewel over and over in one's hands to reveal different facets, or of weaving a tapestry thread by thread until eventually the pattern emerges.  The individual songs are striking in their diversity of voices and styles.  For example, the simple lyrics and spare musical arrangement of \\"You're Missing\\" suggest both time and space made empty by a missing spouse; the hard-rocking \\"Worlds Apart\\" includes Pakistani vocalists in the mix as it tells a tale of doomed, furtive love.  The end result isn't flawless; there is more than Bruce's usual degree of repetition of phrases and images, and the CD as a whole would be more powerful if some of the lesser songs were omitted (but what fan wants to have *fewer* Bruce songs?).  <br />Don't expect sprawling story-songs or party rockers about girls and cars.  Rather than exuding restless energy, the characters in most of the songs on \\"The Rising\\" have retreated into a private, intimate space.  And this isn't the E Street Band sound of old; synthesizers and strings push the piano and sax (and at times, even the guitars) into the background.  But Bruce's voice sounds better than ever, and when all the elements come together, as in the title song, we hear something like the distilled essence of a Bruce Springsteen song: a few phrases evoking a life story, archetypal images, a woman named Mary, and a sing-along chorus that lets you feel the redemptive power of rock and roll.
B00006FDCD|1.0|This movie starts out with a lot of promise, but is dogged by the same problem throughout it - its dual nature accentuates the weakness of half the film.<br />Every second where the characters are children is chilling, unnerving and unsettling, with some sequences making you squirm and others making you jump.  The child actors vary between average and excellent, and none of their performances detract from the quality of the film.<br />HOWEVER, whenever the characters are adults, terrible acting, corn-ball humour and dreadful special effects \\"haunt\\" the movie far more than Tim Curry's clown.  In fact, even the clown loses impact in these sequences, as Tim seems to have been given a script written by buffoons in these parts of the film.  The dreadful special effects include the WORST disembodied head in film history - talking (wait for it) from a BAR FRIDGE!  The acting is no better, with all the adults struggling to do anything with the very weak material on offer.  And, since the ending of the movie, which entails (go ahead and read it, when you watch it it's less painful if you know how bad it's going to be...) a gigantic fake spider with glowing green parts and a gross-out fisting to death of this creature.  Yes, this brilliant and mysterious clown that killed children and haunted adults was not some Gacy or some supernatural force, but A SPIDER!!!  Give up on this movie before you start it.<br />I wish they had done this movie only with children - it would have been creepy and unresolved.  Unfortunately, like most of Stephen King's movie adaptations, it has a dreadful ending and camp acting. (Kubrick seemed to be the only director who has enough of a brain to convert text into images well, and he's gone now...)  I might attack this film with a Digital Editing suite to make a decent project out of it, but in the meantime, put it on your avoid list.
B00006G8G1|5.0|How old are these guys? Yes they are around 45-50 but they still put out a kick butt show. In Fact this show has converted me into a harcore maiden fan. I have heard iron maiden songs many times throughout the years but hearing them live gives the songs new life. The 3 guitar combo (adrian, dave, janick) were killer in this concert as was the rest of the band.<br />For me there were three things about this concert that really surprised me. First of all the bands new material off their Brave New World cd is among the best metal I have heard in over 10 years which is saying alot. Second of all as I said before the band is in top form. Bruce sounds better than he has EVER sounded before. Most singers burn out by his age but he is in his prime. Also despite bashing by fans/non fans alike JANICK IS A GREAT GUITARIST. As a musician myself I can go as far to say that he was the most entertaining of the 3 guitarists to watch. He has plenty of on stage presence :) and he has Great tone on his guitaring. Finally third of all the 5.1 mix on this DVD in incredible!!! Do not listen to this concert on anything less than a 5.1 setup or you will be missing out. The picture and extras on the DVD are also top notch. Technically this DVD is state of the art.<br />If you enjoy good metal such as Metallica with a touch of european flavour and melody this is for you.
B00000612Q|5.0|Many people under the age of 45 are unaware that until the mid-70's, Rod Stewart was taken quite seriously. He rather lost his way after that (as did most everyone else), but his first four albums were remarkably original and enduring syntheses of folk, rock, soul and R&amp;B. &quot;Every Picture&quot; and &quot;Never A Dull Moment&quot; stand as his peak achievements. Because &quot;Every Picture&quot; was such a watershed, &quot;Never&quot; tends to get overlooked, but it offers similar rewards and is my personal favorite. Stewart's sublime cover of &quot;I'd Rather Go Blind&quot; alone is worth the price of admission. If you're a Rod Stewart fan, you shouldn't miss it. Enjoy.
0380789035|2.0|Reading Neil Gaiman's Sandman series of comic books was a life altering/enriching experience for me, and keep in mind I am not much of a comic book reader.  That said, American Gods seemed to be derived largely from the idea of gods existing and fading largely by the depth of the populations belief in them: a core plot motivator in the Sandman series.  What you don't get in American Gods is amazing graphics, characters you really give a flip about, and an intriguing 'oh my gosh where will this go next?' page turning plot.<br />Do yourself a favor.  Order Gaiman's Preludes and Nocturnes instead, and read the idea behind American Gods.  His novel format retelling isn't worth the time.
B000068TPN|5.0|Every scrap of film should be picked up from the floor and the dvd made into an extended edition. Enough stars given for the movie itself. There are already 186 reviews on this movie. The really good stuff is in the DELETED SCENES. Usually, deleted scenes contain seconds, but I was convinced that the primary cuts were in the DELETED SCENES.<br />There was this heart-renching scene in the church as the helicopters swooped in on a Sunday. A few minutes of this academy award standard material beats the daylights out of the first full hour of Pearl Harbor. How different the effects of depicting similar scenes on a lazy Sunday. The scene cuts poignantly to an ambulance-chopper. Rates at least five Kleenex tissue boxes.<br />I first wondered what Julia Roberts was doing in the movie on my first browse.  Then I realised that the producers saved $20 million bucks by casting the lovely and talented Madeline Stowe.<br />Then there was the Sergeant Sam Elliott doing the full monty. I thought the director wanted us to examine his battle-scars as substitutes for medals. About face to a full frontal of Sarge with a stack of medals around his naked chest, including two Medals of Honor.<br />The scene where a yet to be promoted Lt Colonel was being debriefed by General Westmoreland and the Secretary of State was absolutely PRICELESS. Shows the mismatch in the perception of the war by actual combatants and political leaders from day one.<br />I noticed the Eagles on Mel Gibson's shoulders when he came home, instead of the oak leaves throughout the movie.<br />He retired a Lt-General, not as a Light Colonel.<br />Watch the DELETED SCENES for yourself. Alone, they are worth the price of the dvd. I am sure there is much more in the vaults. Somehow WE WERE SOLDIERS II: the sequel would just dishonour the original, so lets get the extended edition ASAP, by yesterday.
B000069AUI|5.0|this album is wonderful!  they've quite outdone themselves for their sophmore release.  Most bands can't get sround the \\"sophmore slump\\", but Coldplay has managed to do that and more.  If you loved Parachutes, you will also love this one.
B000000WHX|4.0|Reviewing an album of Massive Attack isn't the easiest job in the world, especially since it's their highly appreciated debut 'Blue Lines'. This album introduced to the world one of the most complete bands in the music history. The cd includes many different styles and that's why I'll try to analyze each song.<br />Safe From Harm-  The ideal opener. Shara Nelson's passionate     vocals welcome us to the world of Massive Attack. The nice arrangements and 3d's whispered raps make the song perfect 5/5<br />One Love-   If the first song made you fall into trance in a dark room, it's time to take your clothes off and enjoy the everlasting sunshine. The first appearance of reggae singer Horace Andy. 4/5<br />Blue Lines-   The title track introduces the amazing cooperation of three rappers: Tricky, 3d and Daddy G. This song is very addictive, unlike some (American) gangsta (c)rap, it finds its way directly into your heart. 5/5<br />Be Thankful For What You've Got-   Quite a good reggae song but no more than that. Great filler stuff. 3/5<br />Five Man Army-   This song takes profit of Daddy G's brilliant deep voice. With Tricky in between, 'Five Man Army' is a true Massive Attack classic 5/5<br />Unfinished Sympathy-   As other reviewers had noticed before, this song had been praised by radio listeners as the best ever played on the radio. The only thing I can add: this song deserves it. There's hardly a voice out there sexier than Shara Nelson's. 5/5   <br />Daydreaming-   Once again the rapper trio with Shara Nelson singing the chorus. Perfect. 5/5<br />Lately- Another filler song though Shara Nelson's singing is beautiful and I like the bass here. 3/5<br />Hymn Of The Big Wheel- a relaxed Horace Andy sings the album to its end. Although it's not the kind of song I like, this is a good closer. 3,5/5<br />As big as my wish is to give Blue Lines 5 stars, I just can't do it. Massive Attack have created some great songs but this album has 2 filler songs out of nine. Still, Blue Lines is worth your money.
0140177396|5.0|I'm starting to read some of the classics now, being in college.  Mainly because there are really no new authors out there that have caught my interest lately.  I also want to expand my horizons, and read things I might've never given the time and day when I was in junior high and high school.  \\"Of Mice and Men\\" appealed to me pretty quickly, from reading the back of the book and seeing how long it was.  I wanted to give it a shot.  Boy, am I ever glad that I did.  This is an AMAZING book.<br />Written by John Steinbeck, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" tells the tale of two men who travel together all the time, hoping to own an acre of land and a nice home they can call their own.  George is a smart man who always seems to have things figured out.  Lennie is a giant with a mind of a young child.  George looks after him, but it is not easy.  Lennie always seems to get himself in some kind of trouble, and George is always the one who has to help him out.  And when they find jobs on a ranch, George finds out just exactly how fast the best laid out plans can vanish into thin air.  The ending is unforgettable and shocking.<br />The writing was very well done.  Characters were very interesting and brought their own characteristics to life, leaving it very easy for you to tell them apart.  I also liked the dialogue.  Though the plot may not be the most complex one, books don't have to be complex.  In fact, sometimes it's much more difficult to write the simplest book or story.  Nothing fell short in this masterpiece.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.  Sure, there's a chance that you may not like it.  This is very true.  But look at it like this: the book is only about 107 pages long.  (Pending on which version you have.)  How many books do you know that are that short?  Which means that if you don't end up liking it, chances are that you didn't waste too much of your time on it.  I was pretty sad to finish the book so quickly, but then again, it will be an easy one to re-read over and over again.<br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one of my new favorite novels.  It's just a shame that Steinbeck is no longer here.  All the good ones always seem to come and go very quickly.  This is a book that I will read over and over again.  I loved every word, every paragraph, and every page.  Enjoy \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  And if you don't, well at least it's a short read.to re-read over and over again.<br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is one of my new favorite novels.

B000002UTH|5.0|Today I saw Hillel Slovak in my dream. Nothing really special but we hung out like good friends. I'm going to remember that dream my whole life, not only because Hillel is dead for 14 years now and I was a baby when he died. Every time I listen to Freaky Styley, Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Out In LA I rediscover his creative genius. Hillel was the one who invented the Red Hot Chili Peppers' classic funk style. No wonder he was the major influence for John Frusciante, the current (and I hope forever) Pepper guitarist. Let my review to 'Freaky Styley' be my little hommage to Hillel.<br />'Jungle Man' gets the CD started with Anthony Kiedis' whisper-rapped vocals over a hard funky beat. What follows is a beautiful chorus and Slovak shines as in every song, this time with a distorted guitar solo. 'Hollywood' is a wonderful trip back to the Peppers' funk roots, it proves them an excellent cover band, the song is a cover of The Meters. 'If You Want Me To Stay' is a cover of Sly Stone, easily the best cover I've ever heard, with its funky groove and Kiedis' smooth vocals.<br />One of my favorite songs of all time is 'Blackeyed Blonde', it's  about a Bond girl. Raw, fast, crazy, funky as ever and better than any James Bond theme. 'Sex Rap' and 'Catholic School Girls Rule'  display the sexual energy of the early Peppers. The final song, 'Yertle The Turtle' , is simply a great tune.  <br />Freaky Styley is a beautiful album created by a bunch of virtuosos, including the unforgetable guitarist Hillel Slovak and Flea, the greatest bassist of all time. Produced by funkmaster George Clinton, Freaky Styley is a must-have for every fan of funky music and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B00004TR2G|4.0|From the time I first saw &quot;Jaws&quot; as a teenager in 1975, I was aware of how large a contribution John Williams' music was making to the movie's impact. I was also aware that the &quot;original soundtrack album,&quot; which I wore out (you could do that in the days of LP), was a re-recording that seemed to use a smaller orchestra and also omitted quite a bit of the best of the score. Since the (in)famous &quot;dum-da-dum-dum&quot; shark theme was all that most moviegoers seemed to remember, over the years I looked a little silly when I would occasionally attempt to proclaim the &quot;Jaws&quot; score as one of the greatest ever written for the movies. Now it's easy to make that case: Just pop a copy of this CD into the player. The many moods of this score are all here in the **genuine** &quot;original soundtrack&quot; performances, more shivery than the re-recordings, and there's even a fair amount of music that was cut from the movie. And it's all in high-impact stereo, which is a far cry from the limited dynamic range of the mono sound heard in circa-1975 movie theatres.<br />By the way, the posters who noted the lack of the &quot;concert arrangements&quot; which appeared on the (very short) 1975 soundtrack re-recording are correct. But you know what? I for one don't miss those concert arrangements--I consider them a waste of CD space if they squeeze out playing time that could be more usefully filled. However, there **are** a few tracks on this CD in which shorter cues have been strung together, suite-like.    <br />I do have a few quibbles. While it's nice to have the unused (and mostly never-before-heard) music available--about 10 minutes' worth--it would have been even nicer if the liner notes provided a clue as to where the unused music would have been... well, used. (Moreover, I have to say that whoever decided to delete this music made the right decision: More is not always better, and especially in some of the later sequences, the suspense was increased by letting the orchestra take a breather and allowing the lapping waves and creaking boat to provide the &quot;music&quot;.) There are a few cues in which the orchestrations differ slightly from the versions used in the finished film. Some of the surface noise in these archival recordings is bothersome (I was gonna say &quot;archival tapes,&quot; but I'm wondering if this score was actually recorded on 35mm film as used to be common practice in Tinseltown). And if you wanna be really nit-picky, this &quot;complete&quot; album actually fades out one or two cues early rather than letting them play to the end as in the movie.<br />Even with all that, it's good to see one of Hollywood's classic  film scores get the deluxe, completist treatment it deserves.
B00005T30L|4.0|For my money, this was the best movie of 2001, a wonderfully written and acted movie that touches on everything from coming of age to the increasing blandness of mainstream culture.<br />What keeps me from giving this DVD the full five stars is the so-so presentation. Where's the commentary from Terry Zwigoff and Dan Clowes? How about showing some of Clowes' original &quot;Ghost World&quot; comics stories? I'm glad they feature the full musical number from &quot;Gumnaam,&quot; but the behind-the-scenes documentary just doesn't have enough information.<br />A movie this good deserves a more fully-packed DVD. But I've got no complaints about the movie itself, it's terrific.
B000002ARV|5.0|I scared the &quot;U know What&quot; out of my grade 8 class with this album in 1974. ...in short...Johnny gives a tutorial on what you can do with a tortured Gibson Firebird. If you are going to buy one cd by Johnny Winter...this is it!
B00006FXB6|5.0|I'm a fan of Queens of the STone Age, and I was really looking forward to hearing this record, but I was NOT prepared for how good &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; is.  Dave Grohl's drumming is superb.  But the chemistry between these guys makes this record better than anything they've done before.  Mark Lanegan's vocals on &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot; are sublime. As the name suggests, this record is not for anyone who wants something that sounds pretty.  &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot; is ALL substance, no filler, and in the way that Black Flag wanted to fill every second of their music with raw intensity, this record follows that idea that you only have so much time to make a point so you better make it a good one.  Turn it up to 11...your neighbors will hate you and you'll probably wake the dead, but Nick and Josh...thanks for this record.  I've been waiting a few years now to hear something THIS good.  So &quot;Go With the Flow&quot;, and do yourself a favor and buy this record NOW.
