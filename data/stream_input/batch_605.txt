B000AU9UYM|5.0|I hate Batman. I've seen them all with friends just never cared for them. But still I knew I had to watch this one because it had four of my favorite actors in it Christian Bale, Liam Neesan, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine and I've never missed any of their movies and all four of them together? I was still completely cynical and was completely blown away with my reaction to the movie. I loved it not only that I bought the DVD. That's right a self-proclaimed Batman hater actually loved a Batman movie and bought the DVD. Batman Begins is so good. It peels away all the colorful villians and over the top stunts and put together a very well written story that's a very believable human story. There's so much going on in the movie and its all actually very relate able. Christian Bale plays the role of Batman so well showing the more human side full of faults, dreams and the need to avenge his parents' deaths. Liam Nessiam was is usual awsome self and his charactor awsome. I enjoyed how they introduced the villain of the show the Scarecrow was well done. I can't believe I just watched a Batman movie and liked it.

A family torn apart by the chronic and life threatening illness of one child yet reassured by the health of her sibling to save her life. A normal, loving family faced with the burdan of medical decisions which may help one child and hinder another. Realistic characters forced into a position of making choices no parents should have to make. A moving story.

Although a long film, at over 3 hours, it is one you will certainly watch time and time again.<br /><br />Note: There is a lot of violence in the film and children should certainly not watch this film.
B000FA57RG|3.0|The documentary is terrific, though sometimes it can be overbearing in terms of her spiritual and political beliefs. My only dissapointment is that Jonas Akerlund chose to re-edit the highlights from her Re-invention World Tour. Everything is trimmed down into highlights of highlights, not one clip is complete. Alex Keshishian is more generous in his Truth or Dare. For a devoted Madonna fan, this editing is quite dissapointing. <br /> <br />The companion CD only make things worse. It sounds so great that I cannot help but feeling cheated that so far there is no news we will ever have a grab of her complete Re-invention DVD. I suspect that the highly political contents of Re-invention may be the reason why until now (two years after!) Warner has not yet announced any plan for its release. It didn't take long for Girlie Show and Drowned World Tour DVDs to hit the stores. <br /> <br />Not all Madonna fans could make it to the Re-invention or even the present Confessions tour. I only can hope that one day the Re-invention DVD will be released, complete and uncut. Judging from the documentary, it is by far her most successfull and exciting concert. I'm calling out to other Madonna fans to make petition to Her Madgesty in order to bring her Re-invention DVD into the light. <br /> <br />I'm holding out the full five stars untill I am being Re-invented by the complete DVD!

B00003CX9S|5.0|David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) is based (with some fictionalization) on the life story of Joseph \\"John\\" Merrick, an Englishman who was called the Elephant Man because of the grotesque, congenital deformities of his body and face.  Shot in black and white, THE ELEPHANT MAN opens with homage to another film classic set in Victorian England, David Lean's OLIVER TWIST (1948).  In that film, Oliver's mother struggles through a violent storm before giving birth at a workhouse.  In this film, John's mother is knocked down during pregnancy by an elephant (one of a touring menagerie).  Then a baby's cry is heard:  like little Oliver Twist, young John Merrick enters a world of hardship - made all the worse by the hideous disfigurement which will force him to work as a sideshow freak.  Next, we meet Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a London surgeon who takes an interest in Merrick's fate after seeing him on display at a local freak show.  Treves pays the Elephant Man's cruel manager, Mr. Bytes, to give him over to the care of the Royal London Hospital.  At first, the deformity of Merrick's mouth, and his extreme shyness and fear, cause Treves to think him \\"an imbecile\\"; all he can do is grunt and groan or keep silent.  But in a stunning scene Merrick is overheard reciting his favorite Psalm; Treves and his colleagues realize that they are in fact caring for a man of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity, and refinement.  Soon, \\"Mr. Merrick\\" is set up in his own hospital suite, given elegant, gentleman's clothing, and introduced to London \\"Society.\\"  He gains poise and shows his innate gentleness more and more.  He has tea with lords and ladies and finds a kindred spirit in Mrs. Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft), an actress.  Yet all the time his past threatens to overtake him, in the form of old associates who lurk about, hoping to kidnap back their profitable \\"freak\\" attraction.  And also there is the nagging question, put by Treves himself, as to whether the drawing room is not merely a more respectable form of the sideshow, with Merrick \\"on display\\" before those of his visitors who come only to gape at him.  It has been suggested that the movie's Treves was conceived as an opportunist, more interested in career advancement than in humanitarianism.  But this view is at odds with Hopkins' sympathetic portrayal.  A moment early in the film sets the tone:  as Treves has his first look at the Elephant Man at the freak show, a tear slips from his eye at the sight of such degradation.  Empathy is shown also by John Gielgud as hospital chairman F.C. Carr Gomm:  his is a warm, reassuring presence, and the characterization is not without (welcome) humor.  The Elephant Man's other supporters include his nurse (a prickly but good-hearted Wendy Hiller) and Treves' wife, with whom he has a most touching teatime conversation.  In short, Merrick's new friends may not be perfect, but they are humane, unlike those old \\"friends\\" who would purposely humiliate him.  (Just watch, if you can bear to, their truly ugly mockery of him before they spirit him away from the hospital.)  John Hurt as John Merrick exudes spiritual beauty.  Just as surely as that refined English voice emanates from that twisted mouth, his kindness and gentleness make the viewer, in time, nearly forget his appearance, initially so shocking.  When one watches Hurt in THE ELEPHANT MAN, one feels as though one is watching the real-life Mr. Merrick (who by all accounts had the same genteel qualities).  Higher praise can scarcely be possible.  The film's sense of atmosphere is superb, its London a steamy, grimy, crowded place; constant whirring and clanking sounds remind us that this is the 1880's, the Industrial Revolution (which was itself dehumanizing).  Countless moments haunt the memory long after the film ends - Treves' appalled look and falling tear when he first sees Merrick; Byte's boy's imitation of his master's harsh commands; Merrick's comforting of Mrs. Treves (\\"Oh, please...Oh, please...\\") when she breaks down in his presence, and his almost musical exclamations of joy over kindnesses shown him; the terrible scene in which Merrick is cornered by a mob in a train station (quite the equal in dramatic impact of \\"Cortigiani, vil razza dannata,\\" the deformed jester's scene before the jeering courtiers in Verdi's opera RIGOLETTO); his magical first (and last) visit to the theatre - but none so much as Merrick's transcendent death scene, accompanied by Samuel Barber's elegiac \\"Adagio for Strings\\" (the rest of the film's score is by John Morris and is close to the Barber in style and orchestration).  \\"Beautiful\\" is the word for this scene, and for Hurt's whole performance.
0060935464|5.0|Some books so fluidly transcend the stories they contain that the characters and setting almost become incidental to the universal themes they express without contrivance. Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.<br /><br />The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.<br /><br />Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren. Even if you have seen the masterful 1962 film, you owe it to yourself to read Lee's literary masterwork and sadly the only novel she ever wrote.rother Jem, the children and Boo.

Let's face it, Pearl Jam is a true survival of the grunge era. Unlike Alice In Chains, Soundgarden or Nirvana. Tunes that make this catalog title an absolute must-have for all fans of such are \\"Even Flow\\", the awesome \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\" (my personal favorite off this disc), the controversial \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Oceans\\" and \\"Deep\\".

B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney Houston's phenomenal career started with this self entitled debut record that sold 14 million copies and became nothing short of the biggest selling debut record in history and was considered a modern pop/soul classic at the time. 20 odd years later this record may have lost it's crown as 'biggest selling debut' to Britney Speaers but still holds it's share of records (including biggest selling debut of the 80's, best selling record by a female from the 80's, biggest selling record ever by a black female artist...etc) and it is still a modern pop/soul classic. Many critics over the years have derrided Houston's music as being formulaic, glossy and predictable, and while all of those things may be true, this record is indeed very slick and there isn't a single note on it not aimed at some mass audience or another, but that's all a part of it's magic. This record is as expertly produced and slaved over as the best Motown records arrived at a time when an artist could unashamedley chase pop stardom and mass sales by singing music that everyone would like. Micheal Jackson did it, Madonna did it, and with this record Whitney Houston would join their ranking as a superstar. Although this record, and all Whitney Houston music to follow, is not as explosive as Micheal Jackson or as edgy as Madonna it trumps them both in distinguishing itself as a vehicle for \\"that voice.\\" From the first note to the last Houston displays a vocal talent that is absolutley astounding and was unlike anything else out at the time. It was as if she had combined the power and passion of Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin with the classiness and sophistication of Dionne Warwick (Houston's cousin) and Diana Ross to invent a technique that was all her own. Houston has (or had) incredible control and eagerly displays it here rising from a whisper to a roar in seconds flat, changing keys and hitting notes from all over her five octave range effortlessly. It was a vocal technique that has made it'smark on almost every female artist to come after her and making the material which she sings here almost inconsequential in comparison with her performance. Fortunatley the material that she is given to work her vocal gifts around are all great and were provided and designed by a team of some of the 80's finest pop songwriters and producers to achieve Billboard chart glory. Clive Davis (Arista reords head who signed Houston after hearing her sing \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\" as an audition)was smart enough to only choose the classiest and catchiest songs for Houston to record and all of them appealing to different facets of her audience. There is something her for everyone, synth pop (\\"Someone For Me\\"), urban dancejams (\\"Thinking About You\\"),80's dance pop (\\"How Will I Know\\") and plenty of ballads balanced between Quiet Storm (\\"Saving All My Love For You\\") and Adult Contemporary (\\"All At Once\\") and all of them proving that Houston can sing it all. The highlights of the record are of course the hit singles (three number ones and one top five hit):\\"You Give Good Love,\\" a beautiful groover,\\"Saving All My Love For You,\\" a classic Quiet Storm/modern soul ballad if there ever was one and an extremely well written and performed song which previewed some of the lyrical and vocal dramatics to appear on later Houston hits,\\"How Will I Know,\\" an irresistable piece of fluffy dance pop heaven whose innocent happiness and enthusiasm has become lost in today's music scene but remains thoroughly catchy and enjoyable and the records biggest hit, \\"The Greatest Love Of All,\\" a cover version of George Benson's 1977 R
B0000AUHPK|4.0|When I saw this film in the theatrical release I thought it was beautifully done, but I was not happy with it.  I had been raised on the Merle Oberon/Lawrence Olivier version that is softer and more romantic.  So I finally read the book.  This version is publicized as \\"a faithful adaptation\\" of the book, and it is.  WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a venomous tale of two selfish, spiteful people obsessed with each other.  It shines a smokey lantern glare on how people do horrible things in the name of love.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes strides away with this film in a rip-roaring, seething gothic performance as love's prison keeper, Heathcliff.  Juliette Binoche gives a lovely performance, but is miscast in a number of ways that hold her back.  Her accent is noticeable, and takes us away from her - really wonderful - performance.  Playing a dual role, she is later saddled with blonde hair and blue contacts which are unconvincing and really distracting.  This is just a bad match of actress and role.<br /><br />This simply makes the performance of Janet McTeer shine all the more.  Always a striking presence, her role as omnipresent viewer (the narrator of the book), and Cathy's confidante brings her to the center of our vision time and again, and she is always startlingly perfect.  McTeer is like the landscape used for much of the outdoor scenes.  Full, wild, solid, earthy and vast.<br /><br />The Lynton siblings are both surprisingly good.  Pretty, wan, and slightly pasty pawns of the demonic lovers.  The score lifts all this, the fine performances, the grand story, and sets it firmly into a place of haunting melancholy.<br /><br />But it is the landscapes that will be remembered long after any other portion of this film.  The locations are unique and interesting, and give the romantic scenes the visual austerity and dis-ease of an Edgar Allen Poe poem.  The beautiful filming of these vistas say as much as the story itself.  Romance on the rocks with an eternal twist.r /> <br />

0393057658|5.0|Moneyball is a fine book, a must-read for any serious baseball fan.  What I found most interesting was the organizational conflict between Beane's \\"Laptoppers\\" and the computer-phobic scouts, who rely on instinct and experienced judgment to spot talent.  It seemed to me that in some ways Beane used his young brainiac computer jockeys to subvert power from the old guard scouts, the traditional power base of a baseball franchise.  However, I think the author tends to exaggerate the prowess of Beane's computer-based approach.  My sense is that Beane's had his share of missed opportunities, and has similarly erred by picking future duds who looked great on a spreadsheet.  Beane's tactic of using smart people with new sophisticated tools to gain and hold power in an organization is not new, but superbly documented in this absorbing and well-written book.   <br /> <br />Contrary to what Moneyball impies, drafting future baseball players is like buying IPO stocks--it looks easy in hindsight, but in reality, scouting is like baseball itself--failure is far more common than success. <br />
1881273156|5.0|I've found over the years that when my wife and I are speaking the same language about things, we can create an awesome relationship. When it feels like things are falling down and crashing around us, we're not only speaking different languages, we're only talking to ourselves.<br /><br />How can you get back to speaking to your spouse in a language that's understood? There are many models for social interaction that will help you improve your communication with each other. Myers-Briggs, DISC, NLP, and Merrill's Social Styles are just some of the tools that can help you understand how to speak your partner's language.<br /><br />In The Five Love Languages Gary Chapman's interaction model describes five simple ways to learn to communicate love with your spouse. Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch are Chapman's languages. When you're speaking with your mate in their love language their \\"Love Tank\\" is getting filled and they have more love to give back to you. I see examples of this every day with my wife Joy.<br /><br />Joy's love language is Acts of Service and mine is Words of Affirmation. We all try to tell our mates that we love them using our language because it's what we know. Unfortunately, most often it's not our spouses love language.<br /><br />A perfect example is that I'm constantly telling Joy how much I appreciate her, that she's a wonderful wife, and a loving mother to our children. It make's me feel good telling her just how much I love her. Again, my love language is Words of Affirmation so it's what I know and what I do. Since Joy's love language is Acts of Service she's constantly thinking to herself, \\"That's nice, but DO SOMETHING!\\"<br /><br />Joy is constantly doing little things for me which can frustrate me at times. I've learned that when I'm feeling frustrated with her to look closely at what she's doing because she's probably trying to tell me how much she loves me in her Love Language.<br /><br />I've learned that by clearing the table after dinner or vacuuming the carpet or doing loads of laundry that Joy feels loved. Now that I'm fluent in her love language and she's fluent in mine we spend a lot more time giving and receiving love than ever before.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Five Love Languages to you.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch does it again with this incredible thriller!  I'm a huge fan of his work so this comes as no surprise.  Here we find more of his usual stylistic trademarks but more refined perhaps, and brilliantly written.  The casting here is superb!  Fans of Lost Highway should especially enjoy Mulholland Drive.  What I love about David Lynch movies is he really challenges conventions and typical hollywood formats.  Seeing his films inspires further viewing and research, which for me, make his movies closer to books, than any other directors work.  Very rewarding for a viewer looking to expand their awarness.  Expect discovery.
B00006ADFL|5.0|I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release.  Years later, it remains as powerful.  The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.<br /><br />I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers.  The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.<br /><br />Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy - ick),  it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision - all fitting.  There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real.  Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.<br /><br />Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their \\"treatment,\\" the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been shown to cause extreme violent outbursts.  It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made.  I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer.  But that would be icing.  This is a true story, and a truly wonderful film of it.
B00000DCHE|5.0|I'm not kidding. I think this is probably the best live CD I own. I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought this, and did so on somewhat of a whim. The entire CD is incredible, not a weak track on there. The sound quality is astounding, the shows were recorded so well you often forget you are listening to a live performance (and the remastering sounds good too). But really its Billy and the band that make the album what it is, and this disc contains versions of Billy's songs that have never sounded better. Yes, I would say all the songs on this CD are far superior to their original album versions (which were excellent to begin with), especially tracks like Ballad Of Billy The Kid and Miami 2017. Do yourself a favor and get this CD, its only 9.99 and you won't be disappointed. Oh and listen to it LOUD. On a good system. Then pick your jaw up off the floor.
0743487583|5.0|Mary Shelley writes in the vernacular of the time in which she lived--verbose and overblown.  This romantic language in no way detracts from the fact that Frankenstein is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The monster Frankenstein has created is constantly referred to as a \\"daemon (sic\\" and a fiend.  Yet this monster excites our sympathies because of his abject need for affection and acceptance.  At the end he calls himself an \\"abortion.\\"<br /><br />The novel Frankenstein can be interpreted as a morality tale warning against hubris and overweening pride in one's own powers of intellect and invention.  Frankenstein is obsessed with creating life.  He finds out that once he has accomplished this deed, that life which he created is forever his master.  The creature Frankenstein has created makes Frankenstein his slave.<br /><br />Without regarding this novel as a morality tale and taking into account the gothic nature of this writing, one can also sympathize with the feelings of rejection, loss, love and affection demonstrated throughout the book by all of the characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found Mary Shelley's Frankenstein worthwhile because the novel helped me realize just what it is to be human.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|\\"Return to Oz\\" came at a time when the world of children's movies was at its darkest.  In only a few short years, studios would release, in addition to \\"Oz,\\" \\"The Neverending Story,\\" \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" \\"The Black Cauldron,\\" and \\"Labyrinth.\\"  If there was ever a more frightening time to be a kid at the movies, I don't know when.  And, like most of these, \\"Return to Oz\\" failed to earn money.  In fact it lost money ... a lot of money.    But then again, \\"Return to Oz\\" was bound to fail from the start.  It is impossible to make a sequel (and it's definitely a sequel, although many fans try to claim otherwise) of what's got to be the most beloved movie ever made and not fail.  Audiences wanted \\"Return to Oz\\" to recapture all the old feelings that MGM's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" brought to them.  Instead, writer/director Walter Murch didn't even attempt to recreate the MGM version of Oz.    Too much of the movie was unfamiliar to audiences.  Dorothy, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are all played by actors much younger than their MGM counterparts.  Oz is filmed, for the most part, in the real world, with real trees and rocks and hills.  MGM filmed its movie entirely on a sound stage, creating the plastic flowers that somehow flourish in Munchkinland.  The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion are little more than bit players in \\"Return to Oz,\\" with only the Scarecrow receiving any lines -- and he only has about three lines of dialogue.    Lastly, audiences were turned off by the surprisingly intense violence and frightening images in \\"Return to Oz.\\"  There were reports of children being led, crying and trembling, from the theatres.    The movie was bound to fail.    \\"Return to Oz\\" has developed a sort of cult following (of which I am a member).  A few of us, who saw the movie in the theatre, were frightened, but dazzled.  Here was an Oz that actually existed -- I always hated those plastic Munchkinland flowers!  If a scarecrow could actually walk on his own and a man could be madeof tin, this is what they would look like -- not like men with face paint.  \\"Return to Oz\\" made the land real for many of us, and it's those of us who hold on to movie.    As every other reviewer here has mentioned, \\"Return to Oz\\" is more faithful in tone and spirit to the original L. Frank Baum Oz books.  But therein lies a major problem.      Reading about something scary and actually watching it on the screen are two very different things.  Somehow, no one connected to the production of the movie seemed to have realized that.  This forces an odd tone on the movie: the screenplay is strictly juvenile, with simplistic dialogue and goofy jokes.  But the visuals are dark and geared more for adults.  I personally think this is the only valid problem with the movie.  It plays to both a young and old audience without ever truly providing a finished product to either.    If you like the books: you'll love \\"Return to Oz.\\"  If all you know is MGM's movie: you'll hate \\"Return to Oz.\\"    It was a dark time for kids' movies and a dark time for Disney.  But just because something is dark, doesn't mean it can't be wonderful.
0684803356|4.0|Over the years I have read a lot about Hemmingway and how important of a writer he was, so I figured it was finally time for me to read one of his books. To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book. <br /> <br />I found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission. <br /> <br />What made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her.  <br /> <br />Overall, the story is very good. I would highly recommend it anyone.  <br />
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris does a great job in The End of Faith.  He makes many novel ideas very clear, and draws on past opinions well.  Each time I attempted to build any doubt in his ideas, my concerns were answered in the next sentence.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams is someone you may not have heard of.  Until about a year ago I hadn't either.  No, he's not Bryan Adams's little brother.  He's the kind of artist that's there are sadly too few of on the music scene today.  His songwriting is soulful and lyrically inventive.  His music is great but it's his voice that continues to amaze me.  There are hardly any two tracks on Gold that sound like the same guys singing.  He's got the most amazing vocal range out there.  I'm not talking hitting all the octives like M. Carey.  He's a vocal chameleon.  From the fast paced New York New York to the haunting When the Stars Go Blue, his voice morphs and changes, capturing you and taking you along for the ride. This is Ryan's second solo album but a great first buy to bring you in.  I only gave it four out of five stars because the second half isn't a strong as the first but it's still a great album and a solid addition to anyone's collection.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I couldn't quite determine the initial feelings I had regarding this version right when the end credits started rolling...  <br /> <br />So I watched it again... This film will have that effect on a person.. Especially if the person had sat through the more detailed and finely done BBC version and, let's not forget, someone who has read the book too.   <br /> <br />I didn't like the ending..  <br />\\"Divine goddess?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"..Bewitched me body and soul?\\"  What was that? That really sugar-coated the much anticipated coming together of Lizzy and Darcy.. It was \\"gaggifying\\" and elementary... <br /> <br />This isn't comparing apples and oranges. 10 years later another remake is made of this popular story and is put out in the market for people to devour. I know some of us will stay allied with the miniseries and/or novel, but this current remake is just a story for people to be entertained by. Some won't understand how important it is for a woman to get married, in Elizabeth Bennet's time frame. It is mentioned of course, but the key points in this film are about love concerning Lizzy and Jane. The story is cut and pasted together while we can't appreciate the worlds of the other characters. There isn't a way to tell this story in under two hours though, is there? <br /> <br />The acting isn't bad at all. The actors/actresses get into character and don't leave us yawning. I know females tend to wish to be beautiful and in love. They wish to be in some sort of romantic tension with some dashing man. It's all fun and games. This adaptation serves those people. \\"Awww!\\" <br /> <br />The scenery and costumes aren't overdone. I am glad to see them NOT wearing ball gowns.  \\"Lizzy\\" is quite lean though, but none-the-less confident looking. \\"Darcy\\" looks like what a stubborn, handsome man in that era should look like. He softens up too much towards the end, wearing that \\"love struck\\" daze on his face. He isn't supposed to be a bitter,pompous man in the end. I just wasn'texpecting him to be a a creme puff either. Give Darcy some dignity. \\"Jane\\" looked like as humble as she should be. She wore a lot of innocense on her face. She was beautiful though. <br />The Characters were adapted as accurate as this film can limit it, but in the end, we could all pinpoint who's who in the film even if they remaind nameless through the whole performance. <br /> <br />Watch the film or don't. It's really a matter of choice. It's a nice adaptation, but it might leave one wondering more about the story. <br /> <br />Here's an idea! <br />Read the novel. <br />
B00005JKHP|3.0|This movie--the first in the Star Trek series--was considered  <br />ponderous and cumbersome at the time of its release in 1979.   <br />No doubt it will continue to be seen that way by the casual fan  <br />of the series.   <br /> <br />The story, however, is not that difficult to comprehend.  It  <br />essentially concerns a machine's evolution into a conscious  <br />being.  This is a theme instantly recognizable to the longtime <br />fan of Star Trek.  The original series and its subsequent  <br />incarnations deal with this topic in a number of episodes.  The <br />evolved machine is also an idea not at all unfamiliar to the  <br />many scientists and technicians who have studied the possibility <br />of machines and other inanimate life being or becoming sentient. <br />That is, acquiring feeling and consciousness. <br /> <br />For all its flaws, this production does have the luxury of  <br />expanding upon these familiar themes and avoiding at least some <br />of the predictability that characterized many episodes of the  <br />original series.  Many of the more speculative thinkers among <br />Star Trek fans may well take pleasure in seeing their  <br />imaginations teased by the ideas presented here.  But for the  <br />very same reason, the casual fan may not take delight in this  <br />picture and may well feel alienated by it.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, even a viewer bored by the speculative tone of this movie will appreciate its dramatic score as well as the  <br />presence of the original cast. <br /> <br />The verdict:  while Star Trek--The Motion Picture may not be as <br />bad as the critics panned when it first appeared, it will  <br />probably be enjoyed more by the hardcore Trekkie and less by the <br />casual fan of the series.
B00082IJ08|4.0|i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much. My only experience from the band was Clint Eastwood and recently Feel Good, which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.But i recently watched the whole Demon Days album played at the Manchester Opera House and...oh man! i was totally blown away! the performance waas amazing, i totally loved the songs, and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too. God! i wish i could have been there!i had to buy  the cd, love kids with guns, dirty harry, last living souls. Even the soft and mellow songs are amazing. I was talking to a friend when i started watching the DVD and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different, away from the ordinary, catch Damon albarn this time!
B0009A40ES|5.0|I originally wrote the following review in regard to the book, but it is as relevant to the movie, which is less complex but still enjoyable, as it is to the book: <br /> <br /> <br />I've read various Amazon readers' American Psycho reviews over the past couple years and find that most of them either loved or hated the book. Most of them get that the author is using satire and most of them can describe for you a nice summary, including the crux of the work: are those murders real or imagined; that is, is Bateman really a psychotic killer, or is he a harmless loser who takes out his angst against those around him in fantasy? Unless the author one day announces which side Patrick Bateman really falls on, there is plenty of evidence in the book to justify anyone finding reason to believe he indeed was a murderer or a dreamer. All this can be deduced by any reader.  <br /> <br />What sets apart, I think, those readers who enjoy the read versus they who loathe it (aside, of course, from they who are simply offended by the graphic violence) is the (lack of) appreciation of point of view. I've heard and read many times that people find the book too distracted by or devoted to abstract and meaningless descriptions of periphery items or situations and by way of monotony. I argue that is the essential element that makes this book work, makes it real. If the objective of any author writing this book were to be simply submit a biographical piece, then he would do what many critics say and supplied just enough arbitrarily descriptive monotony to make the point clear that Bateman is void of real human emotion and moved on with the plot from there. That's not the objective though. The entire point of this book is that you are reading the thoughts, you are inside the mind of a psychotic individual. It is written as a psycopath would write it.  <br /> <br />Personally, I am not that bothered by the graphic violence, but I don't care for it either. I think that is all noise. The cream of this book is in the trueness of the point of view (Bateman's narrative, that of a psychopath) Ellis maintains through this endless and seemingly meaningless monotonous descriptions of people, music, products, and paisley ties coupled with Bateman's equal parts insecurity --masked by vanity-- and disgust for his peers, superiors, and inferiors.
0307276902|5.0|This book was so good.  I don't care it most of it was made up it is still good I could not put this book down.  James Frey did a good job writting the book.  if you have not read this book you should check it out!
B000E6ESL2|5.0|i saw this in the theater probably a year ago on a date. i never heard of it before but it looked good and she was happen that the guy from the notebook was in it. the hour and a half went basically with myself glued to the screen and her completely confused. the movie somehow keeps you secure in knowing that there will be some sort of resolution despite your dumbfounded attitude for 90% of the movie. in the last 10 minutes the movie really blew my mind. the date was still not happy. <br /> <br />spoiler below perhaps? <br /> <br /> <br />i remember reading a book in highschool 'an occurance at owl creek bridge' and this is basically the same thing only greater. terribly underrated and underappreciated.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pinks new CD shows that she isn't dead after the boring and uninspired Try This.  I'm Not Dead is not a perfect album at all, being brought down by far to many hook less borderline folk songs that are more of a statement rather than a song.  Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self is a misstep and never makes it to epic proportions.  Stupid Girls on the other hand is catchy and also has a powerful message that is timely in every way.  Who Knew is a Janis Joplin sized song that shows off Pinks amazing voice and soul.  Also one of the best and most powerful songs on the CD, U + UR HAND becomes a female anthem that does not preach what others have such as Destiny's Child's Independent Women part 2 where they sing \\"if you ain't in love I congratulate you.\\"  Instead the song shows that women can be in a relationship when they choose, instead of rejecting it all together.  Pink has an amazing voice and a lot of soul.  She shines with her strong lyrics, catchy hooks, and passion for what she is singing.  Long Live PINK!
B000002GBB|3.0|Somehow my memory failed me....yes, it's got a couple of \\"great hits\\", but only a couple.  For some reason I thought the album had more depth / breadth
B0000648WZ|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Its special effects are unrealistic and cheesy. The plot is so thin, it's transparent. I turned it off less than halfway through. I love science fiction and fantasy movies, but this one just isn't worth the time.
0399226907|5.0|The story is darling, and sure to delight both parents and kids alike.  The book is very interesting for the tactile infant/toddler due to its ingenious page design.  If you haven't seen the book for yourself, trust me it's a delight to read AND touch.  Flaps for little fingers to explore, holes through pages allowing for an interesting story line as well.  Just buy it!<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of collage-type art and this book will delight art lovers of all ages.  If you ever have the opportunity to view Eric Carle's art collection just go!  Take the kids to the art museum --they'll recognize the art from Carle's books and delight in the experience.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This album does somthing to my brain. I can't exactly what it is, but it does something. I loved the songs, so it's all good. I just hope I don't go out and do bad things while sleepwalking.
B00005NWM3|4.0|For Nickelback fans, one to have in your collection.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I can't believe this film didn't make more of an impact in the box office.  I saw a portion of \\"Equilibirum\\" on FX the other night, and then immediately went out the next day to rent it. If you can momentarily suspend disbelief, this film is fantastic!  I love its stark aesthetics and particularly Christian Bale's performance as the ascetic and elite Grammaton Cleric John Preston.  The gun-kata fight scenes are pretty beautiful to watch too.  If you like the \\"Matrix,\\" or \\"Aeon Flux,\\" you'll probably like \\"Equilibrium.\\"   <br /> <br />Basically, this film is set in the not so distant future.  A third world war has ravaged the Earth.  Political leaders realize that the world can't possibly survive a fourth world war.  As such, they set out to create a \\"great society\\" founded on peace.  According to the political elite, however, peace can't be achieved without the total eradication of emotions.  Peace is also coerced.  The citizens of the \\"great society\\" are therefore forced by an arbitrary legal system to take the drug Prosium which inhibits emotions.  As a member of an elite police force, Grammaton Cleric Preston leads enforcement of the law against \\"sense offenders.\\"  He is so cold blooded that he doesn't even bat an eye when his wife is accused of \\"sense offence\\" and is taken by a police task force to be \\"processed\\" aka incinerated.  But in a series of events starting with his enforcement partner's defection to the realm of emotions, Grammaton Cleric Preston starts to question his unbending loyalty to the \\"great society.\\"  Overall, I highly recommend this film!
0385336691|5.0|Well, I should say that Lee Child does it again. I don't know what it is about Jack Reacher, but I love these books. Reacher displays some of that Hemingway masculine bravado in an understated fashion that I appreciate and enjoy occasionally reading.<br /><br />The writing is the nuanced, well organized writing that Child readers are used to.<br /><br />Read this book.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|I can't believe this is Steven Spielberg.  The dialogue was so cheesy at times it made some friends and I laugh out loud. <br />And it felt like one long commercial with all the snazzy camera moves.  Then the female nudity felt completely over the top and I'm not even a prude.  To me it felt disrespectful in many ways and didn't help shed any light on this complicated part of history, as I imagined it had hoped to.  He should have stuck to the sensibility of Shindler's List.  Instead he gave us a wham bam thank you maam shoot out that barely gets into the minds of the characters.
B000000H4V|5.0|This CD is Thrash/Death Metal with prog and tribal influences, and a touch of hardcore. This isn't as technical as Arise, but it's still complex. The use of tribal instruments are very innovative. Max's vocals are angry and powerful, and his rhythm guitar is quite impressive. The guitarwork is very cool, with lots of killer riffs and solos. The bass is hearable, and the drumming has a brazilian touch to it. Hilights are Refuse/Resist, Propaganda, and Territory. If you like metal, this won't dissapoint.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|After all this time waiting for the Pulse DVD it is disappointing to see and hear the end result. First I want to mention the cheap packaging. The other day I was looking for the Pulse DVD in the store and couldn't find it. Then I noticed a box with small carton DVD cases. Not a nice collector's item kind of thing that we Pink Floyd fans are wanting to add to the already rich collection. Reading the information on the back I see it was recorded in a 4 by 3 ratio. I had hoped for more, but hey... knowing the concert was taped in 1994 I took it for granted. Opening the case I did not find anything else than an advert for David Gilmore's latest album and the 2 DVDs. No booklet with photos and background stuff, no gadgets, no surprises. Ok, then I watched the DVDs and I wasn't impressed with the sound. Pink Floyd used to be a master and trendsetter in sound editing. I couldn't hear it through my 5.1 installation. It was all kind of flat. The features on the DVD include the animations shown during the concert. They have some bad cuts in them where the screen goes black and the music suddenly stops. All in all I was not happy with this piece and I wouldn't have bought it had I known.
B000AJJNPY|3.0|I like Sigur Ros. I find the music imaginative, personal and at times profound. It evokes in me the fantasy of those little grey aliens arriving on earth and trying to communicate to us about where they are from and why they are here. We dont understand a word, but through their music they touch our hearts, and we are concerned for the little fellows . . .  <br /> <br />Notwithstanding the visuals, I have to say that after a year of listening to Takk, I feel rather let down. Granted, there's a couple of outstanding tracks, and the vocal on \\"Gong\\" is just astonishing (this is where I offer the little alien the spare room . . .)But taken as a whole, this album doesnt have the consistency and sense of completeness of (), which is more of an old-fashioned concept album that should be listened to from beginning to end. This one has your i-pod in mind: download tracks 2,8,9 and 10.
B00004VW35|5.0|dont listen to anyone who gives this record less than 4 stars. just because none of these songs are on his greatest hits album doesnt mean this is a bad record. the songs are catchy, and 20 years later, they still hold up. the only thing thats missing is the record crackle that i got used to for so many years.
0767802470|5.0|This is a movie about what it was like to be in war, to be thrown together on a submarine, to want to kill so as to do your duty, to be revolted by the killing, and all the human feelings that went into the minds of those poor souls that had to fight WW II, or any other war, on whatever side they fought.  The movie itself is technically brilliant, with boring parts to show how war was boring, with exciting parts to show how danger could quickly come upon one, with good acting, with good camera work, and mostly of all pitched at a realistic level--no hyped-up stuff. It's ultimately a believable movie.  The various actors did a great job of letting you believe you were there and that they were showing how real people felt, rather than letting you feel they were doing a great job of acting.  How do I say this--this movie lets you feel how pathetic a war is, how a participant feels caught up in something beyond their control that brings them danger as well as boredom, how it brings a rush when one attacks and then a downer when one is attacked or when one sees the results of one's attacks.  This lets you see what is felt by the ones that are sent out to fight.  This doesn't extol or debase the German aspect of the war, although at the first level it is about a German submarine--at the deeper levels, it tells instead how someone caught up in fighting the war, no matter which side, feels.  I have a nephew in Iraq and read his emails, and I keep thinking of this movie, showing the risks and uncertainties and good intentions and all the rest.  Enough--for what I think is a realistic view of humans caught up in something greater than themselves, I guess whether caught up in a war or even caught up in something else bigger than a single person that takes over one's life, this is a film worth seeing, and thinking about.
B000002L9Y|3.0|Of course, b/c of Rumours every other Fleetwood Mac album will be judged by that standard. \\"Tango in the Night\\" is a solid album with hits like \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Seven Wonders\\", but on other songs lacks power. First off, \\"Big Love\\" is brilliant and actually prefer the original version to the Dance version in 1997. \\"Seven Wonders\\" is Stevie Nicks' only real good song here, and she didn't really even write it, unfortunatly. \\"Everywhere\\" is very good. \\"Caroline\\" takes some getting used to but quickly warms to you; \\"Tango in the Night\\" is probably the best unrecognized song on the album with its lyrics and beat. \\"Mystified\\" is also mediocre but not a song to stay with you really. \\"Little Lies\\" is of course a true hit as is the eccentric \\"Family Man\\". \\"Welcome to the Room...Sara\\" is a typical Stevie song, so that makes it somewhat appealing and mystical but I believe you need to recognize the meaning behind the song (Stevie's painkiller addiction and stay at Betty Ford)to find it appealing. \\"Isn't It Midnight\\" is catchy. \\"When I See You Again\\" is a little disappointing because of its repetitive chorus lines and tone, but the album finishes on a good note with \\"You and I Part 2\\" which has a bold undertone and lyrics. On a sidenote, I find the album cover interesting, as well as the back art. Anyways, overall it is a strong album and certainly in my opinion features the best of Lindsey Buckingham since Rumours.
B0009F9O6M|4.0|On _H to He . . ._, the listener hears a prog band firmly developing its own personality, with David Jackson's distinctive saxophone playing and Peter Hammill's quirky sonwriting sensibility standing out.  Still, they haven't completely separated from the prog pack at this point, like they would on _Pawn Hearts_.  The first song, \\"Killer,\\" definitely indicates a band striking in its own direction, with Hammill's trudging chromatic organ riff dominating the proceeding in the middle of the song.  Then the typical flower generation refrain comes in at the end (\\"We need love . . .\\" over and over).  Oh well.  It was pretty sweet until then.<br /><br />And after all, it is Britain and it is 1970.  You hear Genesis influences in Hammill's erudition, Keith Emerson influences in Hammill's attempts at keyboard histrionics (let's just say the best is yet to come for him), but you especially hear King Crimson influences here.  Guy Evans sounds like a Bill Bruford wanna-be for a large part.  Listen to track 2, \\"House with No Door.\\"  It's got the precious lyrical sensibility of early Peter Gabriel, but other than that it almost sounds like it could be _Court of the Crimson King_ with its magisterial post-\\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" progression and snare-fill-heavy drum attack.  I don't dislike it, but like I said they are not differentiated from the pack as much as they could be.<br /><br />VDGG, like most of their compeers at this point, seem to be recovering from the 1960's.  It took releases like their _Pawn Hearts_ a few years later to establish the truly frantic paranoid mood that was the inevitable result of the Summer of Love (and the ultimate manifestation of this was yet to come with punk; I like to think of _Pawn Hearts_ as pre-punk--one can't say the same thing of _H to He . . ._).  Here, you hear some of Hammill's patent angst, but it is not as convincing and unsettling as what was to come.  There are plenty of great moments for your appreciation and I recommend this for any fan of challenging rock, but if you are seriously into prog, don't expect this to be far beyond VDGG's most accomplished contemporaries.  They pulled out ahead of all of them with _Pawn Hearts_.  _H to He . . ._ is at least worthwhile to own to hear the evolution of the band that made one of the three best prog albums ever.or any fan of challenging rock, but if you are seriously into prog, don't expect this to be far beyond VDGG's most accomplished contemporaries.

0895260131|5.0|I initially thought 9/11 was the work of a few deviant Muslim criminals, but some friends who had lived in the Middle East challenged me to dig deeper and find the truth.    I did, and I gradually concluded that Islam is anti-rational and has a core value of violent jihad to convert the world to itself.  The Islamic riots over the Mohammed cartoons were the final proof for me.    When I bought The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam, I expected an invective screed against Islam.  Instead, it builds a reasonable, well-researched, and well-supported case that Islam is not a \\"religion of peace\\" at all.  Although many Muslims are kind, tolerant, and peaceful, they are not taking Islam seriously.  Anyone who does cannot escape the call to violent jihad and world domination.    If you are wondering what (if any) connection terrorism has with Islam, you should read this book.  It is not a rant; it treats Islam fairly, but it also shines the spotlight of truth unflinchingly.
B000957O82|1.0|Bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because I generally enjoy Will Smith's movies. While there are some funny moments I found the plot unconvincing and the characters (very) two dimensional. Obviously this is meant to be a romantic comedy and I wasn't expecting any depth but this was supremely shallow. Hitch the date doctor supports inept men in finding their dream partner, all the while he himself has not recovered from a traumatic college romance, so guess what, he has commitment issues. Enter attractive journalist, who funnily enough also has commitment issues behaves in a totally neurotic fashion is incapable of adult conversation and because she has issues exposes Hitch as the date doctor in newsprint, using the time honoured phrase, people deserve the truth, come on.........it's not politics. Despite her behaving like a jilted teenager Hitch discovers his deep love for her, and you can't help thinking that you yourself would be running a mile in his place.  <br />I sat there wondering whether it would get better and waiting for it to end, if you want romantic comedy you could do better with something like guess who, meet the fockers, prime, or even the \\"old classics\\" you've got mail or return to me. But give this one a miss.

0141020318|4.0|This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery. Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.<br /><br />When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a \\"woman in white,\\" a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother. The \\"woman in white\\" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum. Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration. Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.<br /><br />The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view. The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business. Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake. A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.<br /><br />The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior. The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot. As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel. The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently.

B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row is not a matter of intellect.  No one's going to argue that these lyrics are Morrison-esque in depth.  Musically, there may not be great complexity.  But you know what?  Sometimes fun is good for fun's sake alone, and this album is just pure fun.  And for anybody to whom it matters (just for the record), this album did grace my collection in college and graduate school, right next to Alan Stivel, Vivaldi, and a recording of Gregorian chants some friends and I wrote and recorded.  So much for elitism.<br /><br />There is one review here I would like to correct--the one going on and on about Sebastian Bach replacing Matt Fallon as Skid Row's lead singer for this album.  \\"And Now Bach is a fat loser and his doing nothing with his life!\\"  Actually, the reviewer missed Bach's megahit role on Broadway in Jekyll & Hyde and his stint as Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar, all in addition to having a career as a rock singer long after his departure from Skid Row.  If Broadway's doing nothing, then I'm going to stop doing anything right now.<br /><br />Baz is brilliant on this album.  Give it a listen and you'll understand how he can make it on the Great White Way.

068484267X|5.0|The fact that I am the seventeen-hundred-and-forty-eighth person to review this novel probably says it all. Really racey and not for the faint-hearted: take a really deep breath before you start reading, it will have to last until the final page.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|HA HA HA HA HA!!!COMING FROM A (ROBOTNIK?) GUY WHO HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO WITH HIS TIME THEN WRITE 212 REVIEWS ON AMAZON!! 98 PERCENT OF WHICH ARE NEGATIVE!! WHAT A LOSER!! Obviously your still a virgin! What a pathetic sad excuse for a human being. GROW UP!!First off, I never said that Slayer and Cradle of Feilth sounded the same, if you would have examined my review a little closer you would've found I stated that all you idiots think anything that doesn't sound like your crappy Slayer >\\"OR\\"< Cradle of Feilth is crap. If you can't make the distinction then you obviously need to boost your IQ. So I won't stick my head in a 500 degree oven like you said I should. Also, your poser death metal bands may have SLIGHT differences in their music, but all in all they all pretty much sound exactly alike.(posers) Nothing worth buying all their CDs for, if you've bought one thrash CD, you've bought em all. I don't care if it's Slayer, Cradle of Feilth, Death(lame), Morbid Angel(they suck),Cannibal Corpse(lamer), Athiest, Bury Your Dead, or Mastodon they all carry the same old tired gimmick just to get idiots like you to buy their CD's. Sad. Your just another brainwashed soul for the thrashers. You say all alt (not nu as you call it) metal sounds the same, then I want you to HONESTLY listen to Slipknot, then Staind, then Korn, then Ill nino,then Deftones, then Shinedown, then Taproot, then POD(sorry if these bands don't worship satan by the way) and HONESTLY tell me they all sound exactly alike. Their not posers like your crappy little Slayer. I've even heard it from some of the \\"musicians\\" in your genre, they say it's all about image. It doesn't get any more fake of poserlike than that. Talent is not defined by how fast you play CRAPPY riffs, any human can learn to do that because it's just muscular memory, talent is being able to write your own diverse music without copying off every other death metal band out their. You guys may play your riffs fast song after song aftersong (which gets old and corny), but you still suck.How fast you play means absolutely nothing. But bands like Slayer have to hide behind that because they have no real talent. NOBODY SOUNDS LIKE SLIPKNOT!! By the way, 98 percent of Slipknot fans aren't the ones with baggy pants and ICP shirts,thats stupid. You say Corey wants us to think he's talented by diversifying his music.BUT THATS WHAT REAL MUSICIANS DO!! THEY DON'T JUST FOLLOW SOME STUPID GIMMICK THAT 8,000 BANDS HAVE FOLLOWED BEFORE!! REAL MUSICIANS ARE ABLE TO WRITE SONGS THAT DON'T SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE LAST!! You purists are just a bunch of sheep. Gotta follow the leader. How pathetic. Slayer want's YOU to think their talented by hiding behind a bunch of fast crappy guitar riffs and worshiping satan so that you can say \\"Kerry King plays faster than anyone in slipknot\\". It's all an act. Slipkot has talent. The people from Slayer and all your other death metal bands are extremely limited musicians and are the biggest posers on the planet. Grow up. I find it extremely ironic how you death metalers hate bands like Korn and Slipknot so much, yet you ALWAYS have to open for bands like Korn and Slipknot because you suck so much thats the only slots you can get. Whens the last time you've heard of one of your crappy bands HEADLINING a LARGE venue. Sure, you see them at Ozzfest, but bands like Disturbed and System of a Down are always the ones headlining. I just went to a Korn, Stone Sour, and Deftones concert and your crappy death metal bands were the first two to play out of ten, AND THAT'S HOW IT ALWAYS IS AT EVERY CONCERT I GO TO!! That's all your crappy little bands will ever be, a bunch of little piggybackers that follow around the same bands that they claim to hate. HYPOCRITES!!! I don't think the 18,000 screaming fans at the Korn concert got the memo that Korn and the Deftones weren't talented. I'd say death to death metal, but I don't ever remember it being alive. And stop calling alt metal nu metal by the way I hate that term. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Slipknot, Korn, Deftones, Staind and all the rest are extremely talented. But you wouldn't know that as closed minded as you pathetic \\"purists\\" are. Go worship the devil or something. Anyways, as for my review, anyone who knows what REAL talent is and wants a good Slipknot CD then buy this. It's probably their best and most diverse album.     VOL 3 KICKS A**!!!!!
0375831002|4.0|Not too often, but it does happen, one comes across a book that lingers. 'The Book Thief' is one such book. The author's unusual style, both in terms of presentation as well as in use of language and expression, was a pleasure. A must for those who are interested in wartime novels and/or people.
B00005OAA6|5.0|This Girl can sing, can dance, she can do it all!!!Midnight Fantasy is such a great son and so is I.O.U.This cd is WAY better than Geri's cd, Emmas cd, Mel C and Mel B CD.I Love this CD
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Al Pacino, my favorite actor of all time stars in this amazing film. People say, oh its so violent, WHO CARES! In my opinion all great movies have some violence. If you don't like those type of movies, then dont watch it! <br /> <br />This film isnt about shooting and swearing, its about making your way to the top no matter what the stakes. Like Tony says, \\"You gotta make da money first.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyway if you think you've seen a great movie, I don't care, this is better! <br /> <br />\\" So say goodnight to the badguy!!\\"
B000EULJLU|4.0|It seems on this release Tool tries too hard to be out there.  I have listened to every single CD Tool has put out from Opiate til now.  Lateralus was their best, and theres not much you can do to top an awesome album like that.  I DO like the tracks on this one.  But I do opt to skip over fillers and unneeded atmospheric lulls.  Thank god for ipods.<br /><br />But once you get down to it, The Pot, Vicarious, Jambi, Right In Two, and Rosetta Stoned are just plain awesome.  I listen to them over and over again.  Jambi's probably my favorite although it makes an abrupt stop.  Lateralus's fillers had importance because they built on the next song.  This CD doesnt seem to pull together as much with these fillers.<br /><br />Not Tool's best but I believe the tracks that I listed are strong enough to warrant multiple listens but with some skipping of unneeded outros and fillers.
B0002OERI0|5.0|A point to understanding/enjoying this album. Who cares if it's punk? Everyone ranting about what punk isn't without giving a concrete definition of what punk even is. For instance, criticizing that Green Day is too easy to play, claiming they're not punk, while offering the Ramones as an example of what punk is. Don't get me wrong, I love the Ramones. But they wrote very simple, very POPPY songs and I don't see how Green Day are too far different (except that it's not \\"punk\\" to like anything remotely successful).  Drop the labels, it's semantics. Judge the album based on whether you like it or not. I personally happen to.
B00007LTIB|4.0|This remastered edition contains an intriguing look at the evolution of what would become the final recording of \\"Gates of Delirium.\\"  This bonus track by itself is reason enough for \\"diehard\\" fans of Yes to consider buying this updated album.  The drums are more audible and one (especially percussionists) can understand the basic rhythms applied by Alan White in contributing to the driving sections of the piece.  On the original recording, the drums were sometimes obscured by the cacophony of sound coming at you through the speakers.  This \\"skeletal\\" track allows for better understanding of what White was playing.   <br /> <br />If I am new to Yes, I wouldn't start with \\"Relayer.\\"  \\"Fragile,\\" \\"Close to the Edge,\\" and \\"The Yes Album\\" would be my top 3 choices (in that sequential order).  If one likes what they hear with those 3, then \\"Relayer\\" will definitely be enjoyed.  However, it is one album that I find I cannot listen to very often.  The more time in between listenings, the greater the enjoyment for each subsequent listening.  If I listen too much, all 3 songs tend to decrease in emotional power (as with any cd), and it is their emotional power that is the attraction (as with the group as a whole).  <br /> <br />The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I feel that the other 2 songs that follow the masterpiece, \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" are ultimately judged based on their relation to \\"Gates.\\"  They just don't stand up to what has just happened to one's ears.  By themselves, they certainly display impressive musicianship (the guitar solos by Howe on \\"To Be Over\\" and the complex drumming arrangements on \\"Soundchaser\\").  But having to follow a sweeping epic loosely inspired by Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" is a hard act for any song to follow.  That said, I find that programming \\"Gates\\" to conclude after the first two are played, assists one's ears to appreciate \\"Soundchaser\\" and \\"To Be Over.\\"   <br /> <br />All in all, a great album from a band that hopefully willinspire a neo-neo-Progressive movement in the 21st century!
B000002H5I|5.0|Can't stop listening to it, this album is absolutely stupendous, moving, terrific.  Tracy Chapman is one incredible musician.
0312330537|5.0|This novel is a magic carpet ride of the highest quality. The characters are so vibrant that you can almost see them leap off of the page. I was extremely pleased with the story-line - a bit fantastical, but entertaining to the end. I found myself really feeling for the characters and relationships that I witnsessed. Sex, drugs, religion, combat, and a glimpse into the Middle East - how appropo to current events! I highly reccomend this book to all.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|This album is an absolute classic, every song on this album is great. This is definately one of the best albums ever, if you don't have this album then go get it now, u won't regret it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all rap and hip-hop fans.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I'd reach for my vacuum cleaner first.  While this might be okay for a quick clean up on the linoleum, all it really is is a portable dust pan.  There is no suction at all so it will pick up things on the floor surface, but the tray that the stuff goes into is minimal and requires emptying constantly.  Add that to everything that accumulates on the rollers which need to be cleaned and it's more of a pain than anything.
B000003RCY|5.0|I really can't say that I'm a big fan of industrial metal, but I can say that Rammstein isn't a band to pass up. Having heard Sehnsucht before this, I was a little sceptical. Sehnsucht was a okay album but it really didn't impress me much. This on the other hand did. From the first track to the last, I was in awe. It basically blew their next album (Sehnsucht) out of the water. I love the mix of some techno, industrial, and metal. Every song sounds different from thefirst to the last, which is somewhat a rarity for me. I also love the lead vocalist's singing. It's very operatic. Every song is good, though I have to say Seamann is the best. I had never heard of a industrial ballet before this and thought it sounded ridiculas when my friend told me about it. Then I listened to it. I can describe it in one word: beautiful. This is just an awesome cd.
B00004KD11|5.0|Spitfire Records is a subdivision of Eagle Rock Entertainment located in New York, United States. <br />So now that we know that, let's talk about Deep Purples' Shades Of Deep Purple. It took the industry long enough but they finally got it right for the earlier Deep Purple. These guys did it right. First of all this CD was digitized from the original master tapes. Before this CD the recordings where very bad, definitely not from first generation tapes, if from tape at all. The second thing, they did the remastering at Abbey Road. The sound is really great. They also did a great job with the liner notes. If you buy \\"Shades Of Deep Purple\\", \\"The Book of Taliesyn\\" and \\"Deep Purple\\" these liner notes pretty much all together tell you the early story of the Deep Purple. I am very glad I purchased this CD. I only wished I would have done this earlier. I highly recommend this whole Spitfire series. I don't believe this will ever get any better. By the way for all of you who believe that this band didn't contributed to the hard rock era. Living through it I can remember the actions of people when Hush came out. The older generation of the time S#?t a brick.. The fuzz the rawness and the harshness. This was definitely a group that contributed to Hard Rock. It may not match what happened after these guys MK1 broke up but they did help shape it.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|This is one of my top three shows.  It is so beautifully written and acted...I love all the characters and think that the storylines are unique and well produced.  Love it...Love it...Love it!!
B00008DDRX|5.0|Little needs to be said about this movie aside from what I state in the title.  This film is loved by racing fans, mostly, for if you're not into the spectacle of auto racing, there's little here for you.  Perhaps we all would've been better served if Mr. McQueen had merely made a documentary film!  As it is, the racing scenes dominate the show and the off-track action can't hope to keep up with the adrenaline rush of the brutally fast machinery.  If I may steal a phrase, Mr. McQueen's acting can best be described as \\"wooden\\"...  Not that McQueen can't act, mind you, but the character he plays is quiet and withdrawn.  Hard to spice up the character much unless you put him behind the wheel, in which case he is a man possessed. <br /> <br />Le Mans is much like the earlier movie \\"Grand Prix\\" in that the real stars are the stupendous racing machines that populate the film (though McQueen WAS originally slated to star in GP).  The storyline is timid and occasionally embarassing to watch, but McQueen makes a good show of it.  It doesn't hurt at all that he himself was at the wheel for many sequences, which adds authenticity to the picture.  McQueen was a very competitive (and successful) prototype and sports car racer and his passion for racing is what propped up this film throughout its difficult gestation. <br /> <br />The cinematography and the sound are top-notch, especially considering the fact that the movie is now 35yrs old.  If you are a fan of the olde racing cars, fire up the subwoofer and enjoy.  It won't disappoint.  With the possible exception of \\"Grand Prix\\", this is as good as it gets when it comes to racing cars on screen...  The authenticity is not 100% but it's certainly 99%.  Watch this movie, and you'll see why race fan-types pooh-pooh the hackneyed \\"racing\\" films \\"Days of Thunder\\" and \\"Driven\\" (*bleccch*!!), both of which steal liberally from \\"Le Mans\\" and \\"Grand Prix\\" but don't even come close to getting it right. <br /> <br />Some of the more recent reviews here have some comical errors of fact, so I'll try to set a few things straight (I'm talking to YOU, P. Lombardi): <br />-The Ferrari 512BB is a ROAD car, not a car that raced Le Mans in 1970 (when this movie was filmed) or 1971.  The Le Mans racers of  this era are the 512S, 512F, and 512M. <br />-The top speed at Le Mans in 1971 was NOT 291mph, nor was it EVER 291mph.  You're high by about 50mph for the '71 race. <br />-The battle \\"royal\\" between the Ferrari 512 and Porsche 917 did not run from '69-71.  There was no Ferrari 512 in '69, and the 917s didn't even FINISH that year.  The '69 race was won by a Ford GT40, and the second place car was a Porsche 908. <br />-If you're going to quote the movie's most quotable line, at least get it right, man!  It's:  \\"Racing is life. Anything that happens before or after is just waiting\\".  <br /> <br />As for J.J. Lewis' review below, \\"Le Mans\\" is NOT about \\"Formula One racing\\"...  Presumably just about everyone who reads this knows that \\"Le Mans\\" stars \\"endurance\\" racing cars, which are quite different from Formula 1 cars.  As such, the movie does NOT \\"shows how stark and brutal F1 racing is\\".  It does, however, show how stark and brutal endurance and Le Mans Prototype racing is.
0006547745|5.0|From the Holy Mountain deserves to be put along side such other classics of the genre as the Road to Oxiana and a Time of Gifts. It is erudite, witty, scholarly & compassionate in its treatment of the subject of Christian Minorities in the Middle East. This book means so much to me as I travelled in the very same areas covered at approximately the same time the research for the book was undertaken. I can confirm the total accuracy of the authors assessments. The book both confirmed and provided illumination as to what I had seen with my own eyes and heard from the communities depicted. This remarkably accomplished work deserves to be read by everyone with an interest in the Middle East. As far as I am concerned, my only quibble is I wish it was twice as long, so as to prolong the enjoyment of what is still the most authoritative and important book about the subject. Do yourself a huge favour and buy this book.  <br /> <br />
B000F4PD7G|5.0|Most students of English literature have been exposed to the Beowulf saga.  Can a modern movie picture preserve the original plot and please the lovers of the first assignment in English lit classes?  It deviates slightly from the original, but on the whole, it is a glorious, eye-pleasing drama that dances around some of the fanciful aspects of the story and focuses on the hero's dilemma of choice.  Does the troll, Grendel, deserve to be slaughtered by the hero, Beowulf?  <br /> <br />This classic was filmed in Iceland.  Watching the scenic movie on DVD was a panoramic plasma-screen pleasure. But the best treat was a second viewing with the director's commentary.  Gerard Butler is a fine actor and plays heroic character who begins to doubt the righteousness of his killing the troll, Grundel with sensitive insight while he still preserves his warrior image.  Grendel (Ingvar Sigurdsson, an Icelander) grunts and groans with great gusto.  The Witch, Selma (Sarah Polley) is an outsider who combines sexiness and fierce independence. The other two women in the saga are the stylishly gowned Queen of the Danes and the water-witch mother of Grendel who is the scariest character in the movie. <br /> <br />But the actor that steals most scenes is the Swedish Stellar  Skarsgard who chews up his role as the drunken Danish King Hrothgar and spits it out with wondrous vitality  The costuming is properly primitive and the props are in keeping with the 11th Century.   I loved this film.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|I like Milla Jovovich, I really do.  But when I saw this movie I cringed at the bad acting and overly contrived fight scenes. The only things that made me sit through it were Milla, the music was kind of cool, and the wierd, super-saturated colors.  Everything was very bright and bold, but the feel of the setting was very cold, sterile and austere.  I liked that juxtaposition.  But the fight scenes...please!  She's surrounded by a circle of heavily armed and armoured guards, you hear one squishy slicing sound and they're all laying dead at her feet?  ::facepalm::  Oh wait, of course, it's a movie!  Too contrived and coincidental for me.
B0000714BP|5.0|Ilove my movie, and the prices was GREAT <br /> <br /> <br />your delivery kinda sucks tho
B00005N5S5|4.0|Ahh, before there was Arnold the politician, there was Arnold Shartznegger doing what he does best: acting stoic, and spouting one-liners like they're going out of style. Here's an all-time classic movie, full of many of sci-fi's best and unfortunately cliched elements.  The obligatory time-travel, the evil and unstoppable threat to humanity, the impending horror of knowing the mankind's irreversible downward spiral into chaos... and car chases and plotholes and time-line fractures, Oh My!   <br /> <br />But at the heart of it all, when you wipe away all the cheesy music, and clothing and dialogue, you really have a timeless story of a struggle against not only an evil robot/cyborg/flesh covered killing machine, you have a movie that deals with our stuggle as people against ourselves, overcoming our natural tendency to war against each other until leads to our own destruction.  <br /> <br />Seriously, the final action sequence in the factory with the pnematic crusher has got to be one of the all-time best scenes in action movies.  Will Linda Hamilton ever really escape this unstoppable murderous entity? And even if she does escape, what does the future hold for her?  Plot-wise out of the 3 existing Terminator movies, this one holds up the best under scrutiny and while this isn't a movie you'd watch every weekend, no serious action-movie collector should be without a copy.
B0007M22TI|5.0|These women have beautiful voices - like angels. Me and my family simply love to watch and listen to them. Soothing music. Definitely recommend if you're into celtic music.
B00005LC1H|5.0|It almost brings tears to my eyes to see an American audience so in love with, what is, after all, a quintessentially English sitcom. My views have changed somewhat regarding the American sense of humour, it has always seemed to me that we English can appreciate \\"good\\" (Frasier, Cheers, Friends) American comedy but the reverse didn't appear to be true, not in the case of Fawlty Towers it seems!! This really, is a review of the reviews by the American people who have watched and loved this programme. As I said earlier, this is \\"very\\" English humour, the irony, sarcasm etc. that up until now I believed Americans didn't \\"get\\". Thankyou everyone who reviewed Fawlty Towers with very apt descriptions of the action, it's obvious that you do understand at least some of our humour. Hopefully this will give you a different idea of what our humour is about and maybe you will seek out other (as you call it) Britcoms, such as \\"Only Fools And Horses\\", as, having appreciated Fawlty Towers, you won't fail to be charmed by The Trotters!!! Happy veiwing.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|With this album Muse treads into grounds over which it has never tread before.  The album has a distinct Queen meets Pink Floyd feel to it.  Amazingly, Muse pulls this off, with style.  The symphonic Knights of Cydonia is a truly great closing track that just keeps building and getting better as it goes.  The rest of the album is also very good.  This is a band which keeps getting better with age.  I think every serious music collection should have this album in it.
B00005LK94|4.0|I love owning the DVD of this movie! I taped it from a TV showing and it was adequate, but the quality of the DVD is excellent and the added features give the viewing pleasure an added dimension. I highly recommend this movie.
B00004W50T|5.0|For those who are unfamiliar with the Band, this album is a great start and what is in my opinion their best. Recorded in Woodstock, NY at their house \\"Big Pink\\", which they moved to to be closer to Dylan, it contains some of the best rock and roll I've ever heard. Rootsy, but not behind the times, it is a perfect segway into some of the more folk-oriented rock of the early 70's. And for Dylan fans, this album contains many songs written and co-written by the man himself, no to mention the cover which he painted. Bottom line, Buy this album! It is an amazing piece of rock and roll with some of the best songs ever!
0060977493|5.0|I really shouldnt be writing down this review at this moment, as I am still unfinished with the book. Albeit a cover to cover reader at a single sitting, owing to certain official pre-occupations, I had to break off my reading. More than the plot, what  would interest me foremost, is the effluence of the narration and the penportrayal that is being rendered in a book. <br /> <br />The author not just lives to these expectations of mine but does overhwhelm in a lot of places by her nature of story telling. A simple plot, no larger than life characters, a very localised theme but what colours the Author's plot is the way she has left the things flow. A very non-linear approach of chronological events- Backwards, forwards, sideways and what not... but still she sails her yacht smooth through the turbulent chronological event of narrations.  <br /> <br />For all those that can dwell beyond lukewarm plots and usual storytelling, I would recommend this book. Although a word of warning... The language albeit english, the narration is not anglophilic. For those that are not used to the life down south of the subcontinent, then be prepared to digest the hard bits of the southern vernacularity and they are not just garnished with them but laced in abundance with the main course.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd is THE greatest band that ever existed.  And in this concert they prove it delivering a near flawless performance that no other band can compete with(IMO).  Giving this dvd less than 5 stars would be a joke.
B000002C1W|5.0|I read 50 reviews somewhere in the 100's area and kept tabs on the different reviews and how they were written grammatically. <br /> <br />I did it like this: <br /> <br />Pro-Gilmour Good Grammar - 29 <br />Pro-Gilmour Bad Grammar - 3 <br />Anti-Gilmour Good Grammar - 2 <br />Anti Gilmour Bad Grammar - 16 <br /> <br />Every bad grammar review had some huge error in it. Some one spelled \\"Guilmore\\" in one of the most recent. It's funny how bad PF elitism can become like Indie Elitism. I am talking about the kids who can only name 3 bands they like that only sell about 100 records. They keep saying theirs is better. <br /> <br />I really cannot say what my life would be like if I did not have On the Turning Away. This song is a regular in my life and the lyrics to me are perfect. The intro to One Slip is just about my favorite compared to other songs that use sounds like that. New Machine as a whole gives me a fun chill at night and is a cool listen to at parties. This has to be my favorite Pink Floyd album because the music stands strong throughout the CD. I won't even go through the lyrics bit with Waters. Every musician has his style and I think AMLOR has refreshing lyrics. I cannot urge enough how much this is a needed Pink Floyd album. Maybe for once, it would be nice to see a teenager wear a shirt that might signify they listen to a band.
0451529308|3.0|I read Little Women as a precursor to my reading of the 2005 Pulitzer prize winning novel March by Geraldine Brooks which tells the story of the least mentioned character in Little Women, Mr. March, who is the father of the characters portrayed in this book.  I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men.  I have to admit that it was difficult for me.  Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it.  What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth.  The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture.  I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them.  By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men.
015601386X|5.0|Great product! The colour graphics are great, the price was great, and it shipped really fast
B000BNI90O|5.0|The Lament of the Elves Leaving Middle Earth is worth the price of this set alone. If you love quality soundtracks, or if you are, like me, a hardcore LOTR fan, you'll consume this set with gusto. I cannot wait for the next two sets to come out. Apart from Viggo Mortensen's singing (don't quit your day job, guy), I truly enjoyed every second of listening.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Sorry, but the band took a couple big steps backwards after a really excellent 1st album.   <br /> <br />There is nothing to say is great here, so sadly they fell far short of their own standard of greatness.  I agree with the reviewers who say it is hard to tell this is the same band.  Kind of highschoolish, both in content and in production values.   <br /> <br />Maybe it was the great producer on the 1st album that made it happen so well, as Leto is so proud to say that their new guy is a peer in age - implying that the producer of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is not really their style or up to their new and improved standard.  I start to suspect that maybe it was not the band, but the producer who was the real artist? <br /> <br />Hats off to the 1st album, really a landmark work of the decade.  Better luck next time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|In essence this is a film that attempts to decry fascism while simultaneously imposing liberal ideology on its viewers. The end result is both pretentious and maddening. Yes, the writers/directors would like you to believe that conservatives are the root of all evil. Yet, when trying to make this point the movie is so narrow in scope that it fails to tackle the foremost relevant issues.  Nor does it handle the select few that it does encounter with sophistication. It's all to the extreme and very stereotypical.   The political agenda is too distracting and the film itself overbearing due to the extent of didacticism.
B00011RPB0|3.0|Though the film is slightly overrated, even those who hated Sofia Coppola's \\"Lost in Translation\\" would admit it has four great things. As so many reviewers have posted their opinions (and more than 1,800 people, which is amazing, considering that the film is not a summer-season blockbuster), I won't repeat the story. And though the film received Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, the script is not the most impressive part of the film. <br /> <br />1) Great acting of Bill Murray, who deservedly got Oscar nomination. His portrait as Bob, a has-been in Hollywood who came to Japan to shoot a commercial for a whisky company, is amusing and touching at the same time with subtle touch of pathos. He does not say much about himself, but you can feel the emptiness of his life. <br /> <br />2) Great acting of Scarlett Johansson, who is also impressive as Charlotte. She embodies the feeling of someone who is `lost,' who knows she should not be here, but cannot leave. The chemistry between Charlotte and Bob is so natural that at first sight it looks as if the actors are not acting at all. (And don't forget Anna Faris who gives an amusing cameo as B-action star). <br /> <br />3) Great photography by Lance Acord whose camera exactly shows how the city of Tokyo would look like. The camera captures the vivid images of Shinjuku and Shibuya, two of the major downtowns of the city. Though the film contains a brief sequence in Kyoto - Nanzenji (Nanzen Temple) district and Heian Jingu (Heian Shrine) - that looks like beautifully printed postcard, the cinematography of `Lost in Translation' is most impressive when it introduces us the chaos of the metropolis seen through the eye of Bob and Charlotte. The scenery seen from a hotel window in Shinjuku, or the crowded streets in Shibuya are exactly what you will find in Tokyo. <br /> <br />4) Great soundtrack music. Just listen. <br /> <br />There are so many flaws in `Lost in Translation': lengthy karaoke sequence should be cut short; a strange Japanese woman who confuses the English pronunciation of `R' and `L' only proves that humor is not Sofia Coppola's strongest point; and Giovanni Ribisi's role is nothing but a cipher. The film looks as if drawn out beyond its limit. <br /> <br />See the film for two great acting, photography, and the music. You may not like the rest of the film, but they are genuinely fantastic.

0393327655|5.0|A friend loaned me his copy saying, \\"I think you might like this book.\\"  I intended to read the first chapter only, out of a sense of obligation to this friend.  To my surprise, I could not stop reading until the end. The book did not follow the paths I had imagined, and the ideas were new to me.  The author challenged me, entertained me, educated me, and stretched my thinking.  At this point, my only gripe is that I cannot find enough other people with whom to discuss the book.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I too, like many reviewers, am completely appalled at the fact that this album is at 4.5 stars.  A shame really, as this was one of the finest albums made in the decade of the 90s.  The music and emotion in Thom's voice are simply breathtaking.  Every time I listen to Exit Music (For A Film), I always get that feeling in your throat when you are about to cry.  Everytime I listen to Airbag, I feel like i'm floating in space.  Every time I listen to the solo bridge on Paranoid Android, I feel like i'm rushing through an immense chaotic setting.  This music touches me, as it has touched many.  Any person who has even a minute appreciation for MUSIC should love this album.  All of the other Radiohead albums are noteworthy in their own right, but OK Computer is the cream of the crop.  It is the cherry on top.  It is above the rest.  No more, no less.  Give it a try if you haven't heard this masterpiece.

I think the author could have provided the reader with a little more information about the reason for her divorce (since it is the main reason she proceeds on this journey)-she mainly talks about sitting in the bathroom crying, but we don't know why she thinks so poorly of her husband or why she decides to leave him.  <br /> <br />It is a great travel adventure and makes you want to travel to Italy, Indonesia and India.

B00003CXA6|4.0|Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works. <br /> <br />I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production. <br /> <br />I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however. <br /> <br />Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book. <br /> <br />The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. <br /> <br />Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film.
0393307050|5.0|I like history.  I like details.  I like a good story and good character developement.  This work gave me each of these likes.  The book is well written and just as importantly, well researched.  The naval terms of the seventeen and eighteen hundreds can be rather daunting, but as the work progressed, and I bothered to actually research some of them, I found this novel to be a wealth of information.  Those who are looking for a \\"bang, bang, shoot-em-up, fifty killings per page\\" should probably look elsewhere.  Those who want an authentic tale, more or less written in the style of the time and who love history, will love this one.  The author fully admits that he has taken liberty with time lines, but this is a work of fiction and that is as it should be.  All in all recommend this one highly.
B00005JP4W|5.0|I DO think this is a film EVERYone should see.  However, I so totally disagree with THORNHILLATTHEMOVIES.  That reviewer indicated that the things that we can do as citizens to avert this crisis and that were noted at the end of the movie were not necessary to state because the film was so clear.  Well, I happen to think that that is a PRIMARY and CRUCIAL message.  The suggestions presented at the end were interspersed with the credits in print only.  There was no voiceover and there  were no visuals to illustrate.  I think these things should have been noted No. 1, 2, 3 etc. and accompanied with demonstrations.  These are the things that people need to see and do.  Absolutely, education is No. 1 and that is what this film does very well.  We then need to ACT and this is where the film fails. <br />  Also, there is a faction out there who believes the making of this film is a politically motivated maneuver.  If it truly an educational piece about global warming and a cry for action, why does he even MENTION his failed run for the presidency?  I saw nothing appropriate here and this only feeds the political motivation theory.  I would also like to know how much money Al Gore is personally making from this film and if the money is going into his personal income, war chest, or towards some environmental cause.
B000AQ691I|5.0|If they made a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space\\" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.<br /><br />The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.<br /><br />Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...\\"). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap.<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his simmering rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT sappy singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride And Prejudice is an exuberant celebration of what movies do best.  In one meticulously constructed scene after another it showers viewers with eye candy and in so doing, transports them to a distant, fascinating place and time.  In a cynical age such as ours, where every image is suspect, this is more difficult than one might imagine; director Joe Wright's success is complete.<br /><br />Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice has demonstrated Rocky-esque box office endurance.  Were she alive today, Austen might marvel at our attraction to this tale of marriage as business, crushing social stratification, and nuanced mannerisms - told with precision, wit, and irony - considering that our own society, though bloated with both pride and prejudice, possesses none of the refined subtleties she described.<br /><br />Apart from our Anglophile obsession, born of the indebtedness we feel for providing our culture, such as it is, this attraction is most easily traced to the character of Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), a smart, beautiful, and appealingly feisty young woman who holds out for love over financially-motivated marriage.  (Heresy!)  While older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) may be lovelier, we root for Liz as she battles uphill. Her triumph does not seem facile, Liz is tested and must grow - indeed, we cheer her victory because we sense she will not abuse it.<br /><br />Superb performances abound, led by Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.  From her comfy chair on top of the food chain, Dench embodies the full force of social pressure as you've never seen it before - terrifying.  Matthew MacFadyen is compelling as Mr. Darcy, he has on-screen presence and commands attention with his quiet, thoughtful demeanor.  Keira Knightly carries the picture admirably, mischievous without being obnoxious, self-absorbed without being narcissistic, sharp-witted without being needlessly cynical.  Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) is wonderfully nutty, ambitious, and calculating while Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), workmanlike as ever, should have been told that a Canadian accent is not an English accent.  Tom Hollander, as Reverend Collins, isn't on camera much but is simply brilliant.<br /><br />Pride And Prejudice reveals a world where function follows form, not vice versa.  In one glorious scene the five Bennet sisters dance at a ball and Liz scrupulously avoids the advances of Reverend Collins while attempting to attract Darcy.  This is the carefully delineated atmosphere of Jane Austen; it's a wonderful place to visit.nlike as ever, should have been told that a Canadian accent is not an English accent.

B00005JNRY|4.0|Lightning McQueen is a cocky, self-centered racecar (voiced by Owen Wilson) who thinks winning is everything.  One day while going to California, McQueen gets left in the middle of the street (accidentally of course).  He goes to Radiator Springs where he accidentally tears up the road.  McQueen is sentenced to fix the road.  While at Radiator Springs, McQueen has a change of heart; he finds out the true meaning of winning is not actually getting the most trophies, it's being a good sport and believing in yourself.   <br /> <br />..also starring the voice talents of Bonnie Hunt as Sally, and Paul Newman as Doc, cars in Radiator Springs. <br /> <br />This is a really good movie!

1592400876|4.0|<br />Children Drive Slowly. <br /> <br />     To many of us who see this road sign on the highway we think absolutely nothing of it, but now try looking at it a different way. Try looking it at from a view of someone who considers proper punctuation and of grammar vital, from Lynne Truss' view (Lynne Truss discusses in her book whether when you have a word ending in s, should the possessive be just an apostrophe after the s, or an apostrophe followed by an additional s). In the book, Lynne Truss mentions this sign, and how the lack of punctuation despairs her. Now, after reading this, can you decipher what the problem is with the above sign? <br /> <br />Is there really anything wrong with it? Why does it need punctuation? What's wrong with saying Children Drive Slowly? <br /> <br />Actually, (after reading Lynne Truss' book-I hope I used the possessive correctly here-and gleaning as much information on punctuation as possible from it,) I myself discovered not merely the mistake with this road sign, but also the way to properly identify itself in order to explain it to others. Children Drive Slowly; really? Wow, that's news to me. I didn't even know children could drive at all. <br /> <br />It's a good thing the road sign didn't remain like this. Lynne Truss had the comma inserted in the proper place, (Children, Drive Slowly), which raised hers, as well as many others' hearts. Anyway, getting back to what Eats, Shoots and Leaves is intrinsically about: grammar and punctuation. The book is about the problems associated with proper grammar usage and punctuation in our present day.  <br /> <br />But Lynne Truss isn't just rebuking the reader; she doesn't only want to chastise those who misuse grammar in our age. True, she does remonstrate those who don't use proper punctuation, but she also aides them. She lists all the rules of grammar and punctuation in a brief, yet fun-to-read (I hope I hyphenated this right!) chapters, her sole goal to improve punctuation for notonly a select few, but everyone. Also, she lists a few of the differences in punctuation between America and (her country of) England. \\"You say parenthesis while we (the British) say brackets...American Usage interestingly places all terminal punctuation inside closing quotation marks, while British usage sometimes `picks and chooses'...the American `period' is equivalent to the British `full stop', or that `exclamation point' is the US way of saying 'exclamation mark.'\\"  <br /> <br />         Next, Lynne Truss mentions Shakespeare as calling the \\"full stop a period in A Midsummer's Night Dream when he described `nervous players making periods in the midst of sentences.'\\" Lynne Truss then shows us just how this happens, when she quotes from Shakespeare: <br /> <br />    <br />         We do not come as minding to content you, <br /> <br />         Our true intent is. All for your delight <br /> <br />         We are not here. <br /> <br />         William Shakespeare, <br /> <br />         A Midsummer's Night dream, Act V, scene i <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Another important fact she mentions that I find fascinating is \\"in Shakespeare's time, an apostrophe indicated omitted letters, which meant Hamlet could say with supreme apostrophic confidence: \\"Fie on't! O fie!\\" <br /> <br />Lastly, I would just like to comment on one small aspect of Lynne Truss' book. First, let's read the passage ourselves: <br /> <br />            \\"Of course, if Hebrew or any of the other ancient languages had included punctuation (in the case of Hebrew, a few vowels might have been nice as well), two thousand years of scriptural exegesis need never had occurred, and a lot of clever, dandruffy people could definitely have spent more time in the fresh air.\\"  <br /> <br />      Now, I will admit that from Lynne Truss' point of view-or any grammarian's point of view, whether American or British-it's alright to be disheartened that Hebrew (the Old Testament, to them) has no punctuation or vowels. However, quite frankly, it has both. It has punctuation. It has vowels. They are not written on the page, although they are clearly seen. True, it seems they are invisible to grammarians, but truthfully, they are there for those who want to see it. By this, I mean that those who study Hebrew know and understand where a clause or sentence stops or where there is a question. Those who devote all the time they can to studying it can understand everything. By having to spend time understanding it, this is how people learn the true linguistics of the language. Therefore, while Lynne Truss is not at all incorrect, in the future no one should wish that Hebrew (scripture; the \\"Old Testament\\" if you will) had punctuation or vowels: it did, it just was waiting to be seen. <br /> <br />Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a wonderful book that I would recommend to all, especially those who love grammar and hate when it is misused. Even for those who don't love grammar, but just want to brush up on the rules, Lynne Truss' book is great for them. However, if you can't stand reading books about grammar, then perhaps it would be best for you to stay clear of this book. On the bright side though, Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a marvelous book for everyone. For those who hate when grammar is misused, it is most highly recommended.  <br />  <br />

B000F1IQN2|3.0|This messy film erupts onto the screen with a series of confusing and fast-paced images.  Those not familier with the 1972 Masscare and events follwoing it will get quickly lost trying to follow this muddled epic.  Scenes change from one locale to the next, and the sequencing of events is never made very clear.  There is also more than a bit of heavy-handed propaganda here.<br /><br />Obviously the Isrealis are the absolute good guys in this saga. The Arabs are all one-dimensional terrorists, which provides for simplistic good vs. evil and your basic revenge thriller.  While the massacre of the athletes was a terrible tragedy, Isreal certainly was (and is) no innocent player in a series of bloody events that go back to that troubled nation's creation in 1947.  This film seems a throw-back to some of the outrageously pro-Isreali films that came out back in the 1970s.  Even Isreali cinema today has a more realistic portrayal of thmselves in current events than Hollywood seems to have.  But of course Speilberg wants to show loyality to his creed and does so with a heavy-hand here.<br /><br />We have all sorts of soulful statements in this film that are obviously meant for Jewish viewers to consume. Some are quite biased.  I didn't find this film to be very even-handed in the politics.  Golda Meir comes across like a Jewish mother from Brooklyn wanting to put her good Isrealis through lawyers' school, but first must kill a bunch of Arabs in order to do so!  The Arabs all come across as one dimensional murderers, which they no doubt mostly are.  The thing about the Arab-Isreali conflict is that both parties are so unlikeable!  The attempt is made here to vilify one, and portray the other as innocent.  Both parties are to blame if we look at the actual history.<br /><br />The British had their hands full with these two semetic brothers during their Mandate years in Palestine and could barely keep them from killing each other then.  Is it any surprise today that they both wish to continue this tradition of killing over that distant, dusty,  biblical land.<br /><br />What makes this movie so popular despite its tedious and far too long length is its relevance to today's problems.  The end showing the World Trade Center in the background is a simplistic attempt at symbolism by Speilberg, trying to reward us for watching a dreadfully long opus with often no clear direction.  This is pretencious propaganda at its best, as only Hollywood can do these days.wish to continue this tradition of killing over that distant, dusty,  biblical land.<br /><br />What makes this movie so popular despite its tedious and far too long length is its relevance to today's problems.

Misterjaw: This hypocrital dumbkuff who didn't get the picture that people were ti-red of her had to re-re Catfish: Return boss. Misterjaw: That's what I said, with In the Zone or In the Twilight Zone. Catfish: As a matter of fact chief, she flopped with her third record, had a flop movie, a flop restaurant and her real persona came out in the press. Misterjaw: the iron-ar-ary is that the fake blonde bimbo wanted a break yet stayed in press with scandals ranging from stealing other pregnant women's men to partying with Fred Durst and so on. Lest not forget her kiss with the old prune Madonna. Catfish: You know boss, that duet between Bratney and the w*p Hagdonna called Me Against the Music should be called The Ballad of Two Trashy Harlots. Misterjaw: You stole the words write out of my hed pally-boy! Catfish: The other tracks like Toxic should come with a government warning on the ears, boss. Misterjaw: Tunes like Outrageous and Touch of My Hand claim to be sexual in tone when in fact are a laughable joke! Catfish: The worst song of all is that ballad Everytime where she is whining and crying. Misterjaw: That dumbkuff should have died in the video yet when she comes out laughing, it shows she is SICK. Catfish: The positive thing about this debacle was that this record became her worst selling album in the US with only 2.9 million sold in America despite a #1 US debut. Misterjaw: The falling sales proved that Britney's career completely plummeted when after this record's release she married for kicks to one dude, then stole a piece of trailer park trash(whom she married) from Shar Jackson and faked a knee injury to get out of touring. That proves that her trying to change from teen star into adult star has backfired. If you like this then you will leave me no choice HEEGOTCHA! <br />

I had no preconceptions, positive or negative, concerning Secretary McNamara.<br /><br />Organizing the documentary around \\"Eleven Lessons\\" helped keep my interest by providing a context for what was basically an extended autobiographical recount of various events in McNamara's life.  I found myself wondering if I could make such a documentary about the lessons I've learned during my relatively boring and obscure life.<br /><br />Although I found the historical insights interesting, I also found the \\"packaging\\" of the content becoming more and more irritating as the movie progressed.<br /><br />First, the choppy editing made me wonder if I was really seeing what McNamara said at all.  Sometimes there were several edits during a single sentence that came out of McNamara's mouth.  He was at times jerking around like \\"Max Headroom\\" (for those who remember who he was).  Was this really necessary?  What was edited out?  I suppose editing could be used to make someone say anything you wanted him/her to say.  Just cut up the film into thousands of single-word visual bytes and you could edit together a clip showing a person saying anything.<br /><br />Second, the soundtrack got rather tedious: two chords alternating doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee that never seemed to let up.  Some apparently found this \\"mesmerizing\\".  I suppose so if you easily hypnotized, but I found it grating on my nerves after a while.<br /><br />Third, the use of file footage that I've seen many times before, including out of context stuff like footage of purely defensive anti-aircraft missiles while the narrative speaks of invading cuba.<br /><br />Fourth, the mysterious off-camera voice in the background that occasionally interacts with McNamara.  Couldn't they at least have used a second microphone?<br /><br />So, although I don't regret investing the time in watching this DVD, I could never watch it again, so it is pointless for me to acquire it for my collection.  I'm glad I just rented it.ra voice in the background that occasionally interacts with McNamara.

0451169514|4.0|IT is not a scary book. IT actually is a book about fear. I have the feeling that Stephen King used the horror/fantasy genre to hint at the nature and consequences of imaginary fear and the ways to overcome it.   Also King's mastery of timeshifts is very reader-friendly. I never felt confused about the changes from present to past and from past to present. There is a lot of dark humor as well (for instance, when a toilet bowl explodes killing the lady who is using it). The book is a tour-de-force and makes for an exciting read.
0141439513|5.0|I read this book about once a year.  It has the wonderful dialogue and character development.  AND it's funny!  A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!

B0006GAOCW|4.0|<br />The plot itself - about the First daughter who went to College in Carlifornia, far away from the White House, in order to be normal and meet friends may be cliché. Yet the movie on the whole can still hand out nice surprises every now and then. Katie Holmes has a unique face and looks intelligent enough to want to be independent as well as not to disappoint the First family. More importantly, Marc Blucas (her love interest) is not like the stereotyped Prince Charming for a teenager. At least he also looks sophisticated and mature and gives a strong case why the first daughter would fall for him. The two make an attractive couple and are on the same wavelength when they share the views on science etc. <br /> <br />The twist in the movie, at least I didn't see it coming, is good. Considering how many such plots have appeared on screen, I must say this one at least is not as predictable and does give me some credibility as a story about real people. The President and First Lady are not given a significant part here. The young couple already is a good reason to watch the movie. The love songs that accompanied the ball room dances are pleasant and well-chosen. The First Daughter stands out in his genre with its creativity and credible performance by the leading couple. <br /> <br />I also hope that Marc Blucas has great roles in future movies for his refreshing looks and performance.

B000EQ4G5K|1.0|the title doesnt lie, she looks exactly like ciara, maybe its just me. However, i must write what i thought about this cd after i read the song titles/ lied about buying it...<br /><br />1. SOS - whats this song about? a cry for help in your so called \\"horrible life\\"? you have it better than 99% of the world, so do everyone a favor and shut up.<br /><br />2. Kisses Don't Lie - wow, you're what, 18 years old? and you already know about what a kiss tells you? unbelivable.<br /><br />3. Unfaithful - great another song about HER relationships, anyone starting to see a pattern?<br /><br />4. We Ride - that wasn't explicit at all.<br /><br />5. Dem Haters - yup every \\"gangsta\\" or \\"homegirl\\" has one of these songs. The purpose of this song, is for all those people who try to hate nothing, will get pulled in to her with this song. Another LOAD of people who lie to themselves. By the way, i am one of \\"dem haters\\".<br /><br />6. Final Goodbye - If there is one thing the world doesn't need its more love songs. i don't mind most of them, but its ones like these, the one where the singer sings about there own life and relationship. Like you should care.<br /><br />7. Break It Off - i think i can safely assume this is a dance song. Great, its not like we haven't had about 2000 of those released so far this year.<br /><br />8. Crazy Little Thing Called Love - are all your songs about love....?<br /><br />9. Selfish Girl - Perfect, she comfirmed it. I was right, she is self absorbed.<br /><br />10. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You) - SHUT UP ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIPS!!!!!<br /><br />11. A Girl Like Me - what, a selfish one?<br /><br />12. A Million Miles Away - people are starving, and you aren't doing anything about it but buying million dollar sports cars.<br /><br />13. If It's Lovin' That You Want (Part 2) - AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!! you're killing me with all these self absorbed love songs!!!<br /><br />  Well, i hope u liked my review, or hate me. To all \\"dem haters\\" of me, go worship you're god (rihanna). Overall, i don't reccomend this.e me. To all \\"dem haters\\" of me, go worship you're god (rihanna). Overall, i don't reccomend this.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mariah Carey has always been one of the few artists; I have had a soft spot for. Ever since Music Box hit the stores in 1993, I have followed Mariah Carey in her ups and downs on the music ladder. A common perception of Mariah Carey is often associated with skimpy outfits hence the bimbo-label, she has received by many. Yet Miss Carey is more than skimpy outfits, unfamiliar to a great deal of people, she produces and writes most of her own material. On top of that, she is a gifted vocalist.     As the first single It's Like That was released, I hardly paid attention to the song. Admittedly, it is a nice club-song with an addicted beat and a memorable chorus due to the repetitive word-play with the title. Yet I do not consider it a classic Mariah Carey track; however, the song is nevertheless infectious and enjoyable. As We Belong Together was released as the second single, topping the US Billboard single chart for weeks, cementing that Miss Mariah Carey had returned to the top hence the word: Comeback. Surely, some will claim she never needed to come back to the music scene, which is partly true: however, her sales for Emancipation of Mimi in America (over 5 millions, I believe) is surely impressive and its sales have not been matched by any Mariah Carey album for numerous years. We Belong Together is a joyous mid-tempo, which is surely to be classify as a Mariah classic in the future. The third single in America (not entirely sure) Shake It Off is an infectious RnB track with an extremely catchy chorus. I especially like Mariah's voice in the chorus.     Mariah returns to her ballads roots on the fourth track. Mine Again will surely have Mariah's big ballad lovers convinced that she has mot loss the touch. The choruses are belted out and quite enjoyable; however, Mine Again does not rank among my favorites on the album. Say Something featuring Snoop Dogg, I believe, is the current single - produced by the Neptunes. I might be the only one; however I simply cannot stand the song. Its beat and the production are too messy for my liking. As one reviewer pointed out, it bares a similarity to the collaboration Signs (?) between Snoop Dogg and Justin Timberlake. Stay The Night, Get Your Number and One And Only featuring Twista are not among my favorites on the album. In fact, I tend to skip them. Get Your Number was released as a single in Europe, I believe. However, Mariah's wispy vocals and the beat are a tad to annoying to listen too.     Yet this is forgiven as Circles surfaces. Circles is a wonderful mid-tempo, which is simply begging for a lovely video to accompany it. Arguably, it will most likely not be a successful as We Belong Together; however, I still regard Circles as the best song on Emancipation of Mimi. Your Girl is a fluffy mid-tempo song whose vocals at the beginning of the song remind me of Boy on Mariah Carrey's former album Charmbracelet. It is nice song, however hardly something special. I Wish You Knew is a light, lovely song with a spoken section in the middle of song, however I am not too fond of it. To The Floor featuring Nelly is certainly not a favorite of mine. Honesty, I think Mariah Carrey's attempt to collaborate with hip hop stars should be avoid at any cost. They simply are not good enough to be included on an album, which has also been a problem on her former records, in my opinion. Joyride and Fly Like A Bird are enjoyable songs. Fly Like A Bird seems to capture the theme of the album very well.     Emancipation of Mimi is the first Mariah Carey album I have been able to enjoy for the last couple of years. With that said, there are still problematic features on Emancipation of Mimi. Firstly, horrible collaborations are, in my opinion, part of the album's weakness. Secondly, several of the songs are entirely forgettable. Still, Miss Carey has taken a step in the right direction. Songs such as It's Like That, We Belong Together, Circles, Mine Again and Your Girl is proof of Mariah Carrey's abilityto record superb songs.     Overall Grade: 7/10

0783233477|4.0|This movie didn't even make it onto my radar screen when it was released.  I can't remember why I rented it, but I remember being pleasantly surprised at what a well-acted, well-scripted, charming movie it was.  Very upbeat for a movie that is about a guy who is about to die.  Very sentimental, but not too sappy.  Excellent score by Thmas Newman (cousin of Randy Newman, composer of many popular film scores).  Don't miss Izzy Kamakawewa'ole's version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\\" at the end- It's been featured on more than a couple of commercials because it's such a great tune.

B000002J23|5.0|Forget the \\"Yes\\" brand for  a while and just picture five musicians at work.  Period.  This is an awesome recording even if you want to label it a non-Yes effort.  I could say the same about \\"90125\\" and nobody seems to care.  Listen to Steve Howe doing some amazing stuff and just follow Chris Squire's flow.  \\"Machine Messiah\\" stands out as one of prog rock's finest tunes, and it seems impossible not to move to the intensity of \\"Does it Really Happen\\" and  \\"Tempus Fugit\\".  Go for it.  I wish these five could just for fun do a second and third recording.

The giggles one gets when things are out of control, the anguish when regardless of your efforts things don't go well...\\"Gomer\\" became part of our vocabulary in my 25 yrs of Intensive Care.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel has all the elements that bring readers to fantasy and keep them reading.  Nix gives us a complete, well-contained, elaborate world.  Sabriel, while distinctly feminine, proves herself worthy of the weighty tasks set before her, physical and mental.  And fast-paced aventure alternates with slower, description-rich, passages.  Touchstone and Mogget both add humor and mystery to the novel, while the darker elements - those that have returned from Death - add suspense and drama.  While it follows the classic style of fantasy, it is hardly a slave to it, and Nix brings new, inventive light to this genre.  This book is marketed as a children's book - I have never seen it out of the teen section - and while I enjoyed it the first time I read it, at thirteen, it is a mistake to think that it is only for children.
B000002GBD|4.0|Nazareth's Hair of the Dog is one of the best hard rock albums of the mid-1970's. Although the band is best known for their two hits, the power ballad \\"Love Hurts\\" and the title track, which contains one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in rock, Hair of The Dog is a stellar hard rock album from beginning to end. The tracks \\"Miss Misery\\" and \\"Beggars Day\\" boast both killer riffs and mean vocals from Dan McCafferty, whose voice is very similar to AC/DC's Brian Johnson. \\"Changin' Times\\" reminds you a little of Led Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog\\" before the long jam at the end while \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\" is a cool blues tune with a guitar sound similar to Lynyrd Skynyrd. The instrumental \\"Rose in the Heather\\" is very cool as the synthesizers and guitars blend very well. The epic \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\" is also pretty good although it if a couple of minutes were shaved off at the end, it would have been better. All told, Hair of the Dog is a very strong album and proves that Nazareth was more than just a two-hit wonder. Highly recommended to fans of great hard rock.
0060005424|5.0|Having read and loved Sabriel, I picked up Lirael as soon as I could, and reread Sabriel in preparation.  At first, I was a little disappointed not to see more of Sabriel, Mogget and Touchstone, whom I had developed a strong affection for in the first book.  However, I saw so much of myself in Lirael - her feelings of isolation and not belonging, her shyness and tendency toward silence as well as her wit when she did speak - that Sabriel's absence was no longer felt so strongly.  An adolescent when I first read it, I could identify with Lirael.  Maybe she complained a lot and maybe she was down on herself, but so was I.  She felt real to me, and that was part of what kept me involved in her story.  I saw a lot of myself in Sameth as well, in his doubts about his future and his anxiety in the face of his parents' expectations.  Of course, Nix reprises his original brilliance in this book, enriching his already-strong world.  The cliffhanger ending was frustrating, though, to Nix' credit, the next installment was not long in coming.  I strongly suggest buying Abhorsen at the same time.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|I Just realized that this film is really a parody of the original. It stars a funny comedian, Jack Black, who bugs out his eyes and makes funny faces. Funny!! <br />The Hero is a skinny funny looking guy too. Hilarious!!! The film is full of funny moments too, Like when you expect Kong to see Ann on stage and its someone else!!! Its a spoof of the original!! I get it. It even has tongue-in-cheek comedy ,like the moment when Kong is going wild in the street and stops when he sees Ann standing there with the lights around her, and its real corney and we all groan.  <br />HA!!HAA!!!! I get it! I get jokes!! Hey, I just noticed. Kong and the dinosaurs and the whole movie look like one big cartoon. and cartoons are funny. Right?  Never seen Buggs Bunny? <br />Casting an actress who is old enough to be Ann Darrows mother has to constitute some sort of joke. Doesn't it? And the plot is a reverse of the original. The girl falls in love with the ape.  Its spoofing the original King Kong. SEE!!!! <br /> <br />Maybe Peter Jackson should stick to elves. Comedy just isn't his thing. Maybe Blake Edwards or Mel Brooks should have directed. Hey, didn't Mel do that remake of The Fly. Thats how you remake 'em right.

B000E5KUK6|1.0|Even if you like this the Tri-Star Godzilla this disc is a rip-off. Its exactly the same as the previous release. They just left off the trailers, which were good. Added a long trailer for Sony's other Godzilla releases which is awful and in some places deceptively shows scenes from the wrong movies (EX. The teaser for GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH shows the Godzilla Ghodorah battle from GMK: Giant Monsters All Out Attack and the one for GODZILLA FINAL WARS suspiciously shows a lot clips of there own American version of Godzilla while omitting clips of the real one.) and <br />also added three episodes of the animated series. bUt they are three of the same episodes available on the Animated series discs. Youd be better off buing one of the previous releases from the used discs. They go for about $1. (and no one is taking)
B00001SIES|3.0|The producers did a fine job on this boy band version of Radiohead.  But I saw them at the Greek in LA, and about eighty percent of their show was taped pre-records.   I mean, when there is a piano fill and nobody is on keyboards?   When there is an obvious Les Paul guitar solo and nobody onstage has an electric guitar?   When the stage screen monitors never show anything except upper torso?   (One brief exception.)  No improvisation at all?  Give us all a break, lads--although the audience was oblivious.   What's a guitar?  Shriek! <br /> <br />If you liked the Monkees or Backstreet Boys, you will definitely like this band, because they are the processed cheese of alterna rock.  I'll qualify:     the Monkees actually learned to play their instruments and had a variety of songwriting styles, not just doing one icon, in this case Yorke,  on a bad night.   Many bad nights.   Many many.   (I'm also guessing that the band mates think that Muse is the same word as Mousse.  This is speculation, but I AM a literacy expert.)    <br /> <br />Don't like slagging things, not my style.   But I did get totally offended by the fact that they did not play their instruments live, or at least much of the parts.   It raises the question of how much and what they actually play on disk.  Buyer beware.  If authenticity is your bag, then don't put this disk in there.

I definitely recommend this to anyone religious and non-religious alike.
1401200923|4.0|I was highly pleased to have read Loeb and Lee's Batman: Hush.  The artistry rivals that of Japanese manga and the story line is rich with internal detail.  The reader is exposed (for me a first) to the insights of Batman's mind.  Throughout the story, we know what he's feeling and what he worries about.  There are times, however, where the internal narration gets in the way with the real-time events. For example, Batman will be fighting and in the same panel, he will be thinking about someone else.  Hush is a good story for new Batman fans, though.  Loeb does new readers the favor of explaining new and old characters albeit some may find the practice boring.  Catwoman is also in need of some development.  As much as I found her intriguing, I'd like to see more of the justice-seeking Catwoman, the Catwoman who fights so ardently for the weak and cannot stand to see injustice prevail.<br /><br />Also, I would have to disagree with a few of the reviewers regarding the plot twists.  Maybe they were meant to bring in as many DC characters into the story as possible, I found this practice entertaining.  It's a new thing to see old villains being used by new ones to show how easily the old villain's insecurities and weaknesses are exploited.  This approach made the old villains appear more human than the plastic characters we are so used to seeing the televised Batman series.  (Before you rip my head off, the Batman series has come a long way, so don't think I consider Batman villains to be plastic as they are not so in the cartoon series as they were in the 1960's television series).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  A great read, nearly a masterpiece.  It's easy for new Batman fans to become acquainted with this fandom since new and old characters are explained.  We are also exposed to the inner workings of Batman's mind, a slight oversight in Frank Miller's Batman: Year One, however annoying at times.  Catwoman's character is a bit limited to her saucy and flirtatious ways, though she does not fail to amuse.  Above all, a great read and well worth the time.ot fail to amuse.

B000002U82|5.0|\\"Breathe, Breathe in the Air, Don't be Afraid to Care.\\" Take a deep breathe because we are going on an out of this planet adventure courtesy of our hosts Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is one of the most memorable album's of the 1970's. Originally released on March 3rd, 1973, it was re-released as a 30th anniversary edition. It has withstood the test of time making it one of the best albums of that whole musical era. Pink Floyd was made up of Roger Moore, Syd Barrett, who is not on this album, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright. And in case it was not already known Pink Floyd is a part of the Psychedelic Rock genre. They have released twenty albums in their time. They released eight albums before Dark Side of the Moon some including Atom Heart Mother, Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Meddle. When Dark Side of the Moon was released it was #1 on the Billboard charts it's debut week. Now that says a lot about how well received this album was and how influential it has been over the years.<br /><br />Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is a psychedelic look at the time that they lived in and was a metaphor for life. From the first line of the album until the very last track this album flows perfectly. Every transition either between parts of songs or just in between songs themselves are flawless. For this reason Dark Side of the Moon is considered to be one of the most revolutionary albums ever created. With tracks like \\"Time,\\" \\"Money,\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" this album had a lot of radio play back then and even still to today. Sometimes a radio station will play some of the other tracks off of the album in regular rotation just proving the impact this album has had on the musical world. People have been listening to Dark Side of the Moon for years now, and there are not too many people who like classic rock who do not like this album, even if it is just for the catching singles tracks.<br /><br />At first listen to this album one might think, if not previously knowledgeable about Pink Floyd, \\"What is going on here?\\". And that was my first reaction to the album because it was the first Pink Floyd album I ever listened to. Now that reaction was definitely not a bad reaction, in fact it made me think and I listened to it again to try to understand the meaning behind the album. And after that listen I started to understand the music and the lyrics and it became a daily part of my life. This album is so amazing because it takes you on ups and downs, to the back of you brain and back, and all over what you consider being \\"reality\\". Every Pink Floyd album is like nothing else ever created and yet with that they have become one of the world's most loved and renowned bands of all time. Every album can stand on it's own but when put together they all go in a beautiful series of amazing musical achievement.<br /><br />If the point of this review is not clear yet it is that Dark Side of the Moon is a spectacular album with absolutely no bad tracks. This is a rarity these days because the better part of the time an album only has maybe three or four good songs and the rest are sub par. Therefore it is impossible for me to pick a favorite track or multiple favorite tracks, so here is a play by play for each track. The album starts off with \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" which is an absolutely brilliant opening track. It begins with a faint heartbeat that grows louder and louder. When the song kicks in it feels like birth. When all of your sensory organs take in everything around you and you take those first breaths of life. It is then followed by \\"On the Run\\" which is a music only track that sets the mood for the next track. \\"Time\\" is one of the singles off of the album but do not let that discourage you from listening to it. It starts off slow and with the sounding of the alarm clocks you know that something is about to happen. The song builds up and up and up until you are about to explode with anticipation. \\"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day... Shorter of breath and one day closer to death\\" is just probably one of the most profound lyrics on the album. \\"Time\\" is then followed by \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\", where Pink Floyd take you on a beautiful harmonic ride through you brain.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Money,\\" which is probably the most known single off of Dark Side of the Moon. It is a classic where there was not a classic before. It is one of the most played Pink Floyd songs on the radio comparable to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin. This track actually was the first song ever to use looping in the production of it. This allowed them to use cash register noises and make a beat for the song. Following \\"Money\\" is \\"Us and Them,\\" for which the line \\"Black and Blue... And who knows which is which and who is who\\" pretty much sums up the entire song. This track makes you think and look at what ideas have been put into our brains versus what ideas are actually our own. It is a very interesting look at what we call \\"reality\\" because more and more society does not question things anymore and this track forces you to do so. Next up is \\"Any Colour you Like\\". This track is purely instrumental and provides a good transition to \\"Brain Damage\\". \\"Brain Damage\\" is the final single off of the album. This is the track that gives the last build up to the final track. My favorite line from this track that gives the perfect feel of it is \\"You lock the door...And throw away the key... There's someone in my head but it's not me\\". This line can mean so many different things to different people that it could be the most important line in the whole album. The album ends with \\"Eclipse\\" which is a beautiful song that perfectly ends the album. With the vocal harmonies, the beautiful guitar work and the amazing organ work give the album a spectacular ending.<br /><br />With all these spectacular songs Dark Side of the Moon has been made a timeless album that will always find a fan basis. Whether it is hippies, rockers or just people who like great music this album will never die. Now a lot of people would criticize this review stating that \\"Dark Side of the Moon is not their best album\\" and I respect their opinions. But to me whenever I think of Pink Floyd the first thought in my mind is the album Dark Side of the Moon. The album fills the mind, body and soul with joy and reverence of how great music was. And the fact that it syncs up perfectly with The Wizard of Oz if played twice through is proof enough of how interesting and introspective Pink Floyd really is. Obviously Pink Floyd is no longer around making albums. This is because of many different conflicts within the band. But even that can not detract from their fan base. A true Pink Floyd fan can listen to it anytime of the day and never get sick of it. And for that reason alone I believe Pink Floyd will be around forever leaving their mark on generations to come.he moments that make up a dull day... Shorter of breath and one day closer to death\\" is just probably one of the most profound lyrics on the album. \\"Time\\" is then followed by \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\", where Pink Floyd take you on a beautiful harmonic ride through you brain.  <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Money,\\" which is probably the most known single off of Dark Side of the Moon.

This track actually was the first song ever to use looping in the production of it. This allowed them to use cash register noises and make a beat for the song. Following \\"Money\\" is \\"Us and Them,\\" for which the line \\"Black and Blue... And who knows which is which and who is who\\" pretty much sums up the entire song. This track makes you think and look at what ideas have been put into our brains versus what ideas are actually our own. It is a very interesting look at what we call \\"reality\\" because more and more society does not question things anymore and this track forces you to do so. Next up is \\"Any Colour you Like\\". This track is purely instrumental and provides a good transition to \\"Brain Damage\\". \\"Brain Damage\\" is the final single off of the album. This is the track that gives the last build up to the final track. My favorite line from this track that gives the perfect feel of it is \\"You lock the door...And throw away the key... There's someone in my head but it's not me\\". This line can mean so many different things to different people that it could be the most important line in the whole album. The album ends with \\"Eclipse\\" which is a beautiful song that perfectly ends the album. With the vocal harmonies, the beautiful guitar work and the amazing organ work give the album a spectacular ending. <br /> <br />With all these spectacular songs Dark Side of the Moon has been made a timeless album that will always find a fan basis. Whether it is hippies, rockers or just people who like great music this album will never die. Now a lot of people would criticize this review stating that \\"Dark Side of the Moon is not their best album\\" and I respect their opinions. But to me whenever I think of Pink Floyd the first thought in my mind is the album Dark Side of the Moon. The album fills the mind, body and soul with joy and reverence of how great music was. And the fact that it syncs up perfectly with The Wizard of Oz if played twice through is proof enough of how interesting and introspective Pink Floyd really is. Obviously Pink Floyd is no longer around making albums. This is because of many different conflicts within the band. But even that can not detract from their fan base. A true Pink Floyd fan can listen to it anytime of the day and never get sick of it. And for that reason alone I believe Pink Floyd will be around forever leaving their mark on generations to come.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Hey You...... <br /> <br />      Stop complaining about this DVD.  I admit, it would have been fantastic to see it in wide-screen format, but I am just happy that it finally has seen the light of day.  The sound mix is amazing, and there are many things that I have heard that are lost on the original VHS and CD releases.  An example is at the end of \\"High Hopes,\\" the acoustic guitar keeps playing during the fade out for a long time, but I don't ever recall hearing that on my VHS or CD version of Pulse.  Also, the bass mix is just fantastic, Guy Pratt did a great job on this tour, and added some much needed energy on stage for the group as well.  I love the new camera shots (if you watched the VHS tape as much as I did growing up 12 years ago, you'll notice the new camera angles that they used.)  A great shot of Nick playing the gong in \\"High Hopes,\\" and of course, the shots during \\"Comfortably Numb\\" of the giant mirror ball look even better than ever.  Wish they would have cut out more of the video footage in \\"Time\\" since it is included as a bonus feature, and shown more of the roto-tom solo, but I'm a drummer so I'd want to see that now wouldn't I :)  Anyway.... if you're a hard-core Floyd fan, or even a casual Floyd-fan who wants to see what this band was all about, PLEASE!! go out and buy this today.  Oh yeah, I love the Bootlegging the Bootleggers section, those songs NEEDED to be included in this set because they are some of the best things that the \\"New\\" Floyd produced.  We're never getting a live DVD of \\"The Wall\\" so this is well worth your money!!  Get it and Enjoy!!!!!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|If you are wondering if Muse's fourth studio album - Black Holes and Revelations is good, let me assure you, it is not only good, it's bloody well GREAT.<br /><br />I thank my son for turning me on to Muse. Honestly, they are about the only thing musically that we have agreed upon recently. We used to have some common likes in the nineties but both traveled different roads in Y2K, he going the Hip Hop route and I heading to Europe for a dose of Femme and Symphonic Metal.<br /><br />Muse of course, is neither, although they are European (UK). In the case of Black Holes and Revelations, their music is so wildly varied it defies labeling. From the angelic, harpy sounding, bombastic lead song - \\"Take a Bow,\\" to the catchy rock song with piano and a strong beat - \\"Starlight,\\" to the funky bass driven sound and high pitched falsetto vocal of Matt Bellamy - \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" one might suspect they were listening to three separate bands.<br /><br />Following songs like the complex, involved - \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" the short but sweet slow ballad - \\"Soldier's Poem,\\" the spacey Floydish slow paced, building toward a crescendo - \\"Invincible,\\" to the speedy guitar driven - \\"Assassin,\\" would only reinforce the feeling of different bands playing different music but sharing the same lead singer.<br /><br />\\"Exo-Politics,\\" a medium speed, percussion led rock number, is followed by the wonderfully complex flamenco sounding, \\"City of Delusion.\\" The flamenco influence continues in, \\"Hoodoo,\\" but is interrupted by a strong classical and operatic intrusion of piano and vocals. The last song, \\"Knights of Cydonia,\\" is a kaleidoscope of interesting sounds and Queenesque vocal harmonies, set to a galloping beat. It is close, but this gets my vote for best song.<br /><br />Song Track List<br /><br />1. Take A Bow (4:35)<br /><br />2. Starlight (3:59)<br /><br />3. Supermassive Black Hole (3:29)<br /><br />4.

In my estimation, they not only equaled Absolution with Black Holes and Revelations but eclipsed it.<br /><br />When listening to Muse I cannot help but make comparisons to the mega band of the eighties and nineties - Queen. Yes, there are definite similarities to that wondrous band: diverse, eclectic song writing, ranging from the simplistic to the grandiose; style and delivery are in many cases similar to Queen; composition and arrangements also resemble Queen and lastly their vocals and harmonizing again, remind me of Queen. Yet, with all the similarities they are so different. Yes they remind me of Queen but I didn't say the sound like Queen. Maybe a little here and there but overall, they're Muse.<br /><br />Until now my favorite Muse album was Origin of Symmetry. I doubt whether I will get Black Holes and Revelations out of my Cd player for awhile. It's not the kind of album that gets old very fast - five stars.ible (5:00) <br />7. Assassin (3:31) <br />8.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I've watched the Sir Lawrence Olivier version, 1980 BBC miniseries, the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle and then this version.  The Firth/Ehle adaptation is the most faithful to the book in terms of preserving events and accuracy with the times but even then, scenes and characters were cut.  Adaptation is just that an adaptation otherwise for heaven sake's read the novel.  In an adaptation, the idea is to capture the essence of what Austen presents.  I feel this version fails on many accounts.  P&P is a romance.  In this movie, there is absolutely no chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy.  You can't root for them to get together because you wonder why they would want to be together at all.  P&P is also a comedy of manners.  Austen was the master of social satire.  In P&P, she critiques the aristocracy, the church, the army, the intelligentia and the frivolous with dry wit.  I saw very little of that in the movie. When you do a period movie, you have to get the feeling that you've gone away from the here and now and to another place.  The language is too modern such that when the actors utter a real line straight out of the novel, it seems very jarring.  It's ashame really because you have excellent actors like Brenda Blethyn(Mrs. Bennet), Tom Hollander(Mr. Collins), Penelope Wilton(Mrs. Gardiner)and Claudie Blakely(Charlotte Lucas).  The script and the direction are just subpar.  Many events occur in P&P but the book spans a year in the life of the Bennets.  All the events are smashed up next to one another.  You have no sense at all that the passage of time has occured.  You would think the story happened within two months.  I give this movie two stars because there were some good attempts to make this movie interesting.  Village life is not glamorous or clean.  The ages of the Bennet daughters are the most accurate with regard to faithfulness to the book.  Jenna Malone's performance as Lydia Bennet is lively and fun.  The sets and costume design were very good however thewind-blown hair on everyone was a bit too much for me.  In the end, all could have been forgiven for this movie if there had been excellent performances from the actors who played Lizzie and Darcy but they were hemmed in by a pedestrian script and mediocre direction.
B000FOQ0TG|3.0|I bought this way back when it had just been released on VHS.  This blew my mind away.  It was and probably still is one of my favorite live albums and perfomances.  Anyone who was a Queensryche fan should have already had the VHS version.  I am glad now that it came out on DVD but I must say that I am very disappointed.  What is so special about this deluxe edition...The slipcase.  Cmon.  The sound quality of the concert is poor for a dvd format.  Not even in Stereo.  If you havent bought this boxset yet, dont.  Buy the VHS edition instead.
192076920X|5.0|I fell in love with India while reading Shantaram and before I had finished it, I actually booked a flight to Mumbai. What an amazing adventure.....both the book and the trip. I even visited Leopold's! I admire Robert's writing style, the tenderness with which Lin (the main character who is obviously Robert's own inner-voice) describes the people he meets and his evolving relationship with them. Most of all, I liked the spirit with which the book was written. Rather than finding it to be a self-indulgent catharsis as a few reviewers imply, I found it to be a chronicle of self-understanding, enlightenment, redemption, compassion, and hope. He understands life--all of it--and he values people from the heart. I can't wait to read more of his work and to make a return trip to India.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I'll get the minor problems out of the way first.  This movie and its predecessor are dark, gory, and at times downright disturbing.  There is more gore and more sensuality in this sequel than the first - the sensual scenes were, in my opinion, unnecessary to the story but sex sells, unfortunately.<br /><br />The loss of one star (4/5) was not from the gore or sensuality but from the incredible storyline that could and should have been extended.  There was a lot to tell and it was obvious it was compressed to some extent.  There were a few minor glitches in filling us in but overall it was well done.  So the shortness of the flick loses a point with me.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the first Underworld you shouldn't have any gripes about this one.  It's definitely more involved in the story development and the characters that appear - but those are rewards for the avid fan.  If you weren't a fan of the first Underworld or were mildly to fairly impressed you may be disappointed with this one: it carries the same feel and elements forward into a more explosive package.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned Underworld and Evolution have breathed a fresh sigh of relief into this genre of horror.  They have succeeded in blending action, horror, and science fiction into a film series using the timeless staples of vampires and werewolves.  Well done.<br /><br />Watch and Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|After Battlestar Galactica, science fiction series are not quite evaluated by the same standards anymore. Trying their best in \\"Firefly\\" doesn't quite make it happen either. Presented as a kind of western in space story results regrettably in a space opera more like what we see in ordinary action series. As science fiction it fells short of its pretensions, as an action story it is relatively entertaining. What are missing are probably a somewhat better plot and more fascinating personalities. But if you are anything like me and misses science fiction series, it is much better than no series at all.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|There all are manner of comments and criticisms that can be made about Avenged Sevenfold: they're nu-metal, they copy other sounds, they're uninspired, etc, etc...<br /><br />If you're in the habit of classifying music into categories to decide your pleasure or pain of listening I won't be of much help.  My advice: listen to the music here on Amazon or go to Avenged Sevenfold's website where you can watch FREE music videos and download several songs from different albums.  Decide for yourself what you think of their music.<br /><br />They have many distinct styles that sometimes blend together on one song; this creates a strange discordant symmetry that makes listening almost an adventure.  I find their lyrical content to be thoughtful and well written.  You'll find themes from regret, to despair, to destruction, and so forth all throughout the album.  It's not whiny baby stuff either - it's \\"look at mankind's mess and decide what you're gonna do\\" stuff.<br /><br />Listen and enjoy
B00005JOQS|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this, chills went through my spine.  I am a huge Superman fan (that is comics, movies, cartoons, etc.)  Having seen X-3 before this and being supremely disappointed, I went to this movie both excited and dreadful of what the movie would be like.  And let me tell you, I was blown away!  It was extraordinary.  The awesome effects and directing were excellently blended with brilliant acting and story writing.  Newcomer Brandon Routh pulled off both Superman and Clark Kent with the same great talent as his predeceser.  Kevin Spacey did an excellent job as Lex Luthor, playing up his madness and egocentricity.  Kate bosworth could have been a little better as Lois Lane, but she gets kudos for several good scenes.  A film, of course is only as good as its director.  Personnally, I'm glad that Brian Singer did Superman rather than X-3.  Some of scenes are so extravagent that they are more art than just film.  Anyway its just a great movie overall.  I wonder if they'll make a sequel, as long as they stay with the greatness that they have resurrected with Superman Returns.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Having no predetermined field of musical preference I listened attentively to selections from this album in a friend's car one sunny morning and found myself nodding and grooving the whole ride.<br /><br />There's only a couple of songs that didn't grab my attention - but on an album with over a dozen that's not much to gripe about.  More than half the songs are downright hypnotic and fit very well while riding around in the car.  A couple of them are quite thought-provoking: tune in to \\"Crazy\\", \\"Just a Thought\\", and \\"Go-Go Gadget Gospel\\" for starters.<br /><br />Listen and Enjoy
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I thought it was great movie.  Ii explained a lot from the first movie.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|This is a very good album for TOAD'S second go but for chr.st's sake, couldn't the guy who wrote the lyrics get over the fact that his woman left him, move on.  You would think the other band members would have had the b@lls to step up and say, \\"Ok, enough songs about the chick\\" because every song is about him and his chick and how she left him.  Wholey smoke, throw in something about fast cars or satan but EVERY SONG about the chick!   <br /> <br />If the singer is that much of a weiner, it's no wonder she left. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I solid listen.
1594200823|5.0|<br /> <br />A great book - a big cut above the typical one note entries in the genre because Polan accepts no easy answers, genuinely questioning his own preconceptions and providing a fascinating mini-education in each topic he touches on.  Sure, as expected, conventional factory farming is revealed to be frightful, but what about those 'free range' chickens and organic baby field greens I was so blithely taking home? <br /> <br />I take exception to Mr. Marcus' statement in his review that the book is flawed merely because it doesn't endorse his own decision to try to be an herbivore.  Marcus is unwilling to consider what Polan so convincingly proves - that just because Marcus considers his own way of eating to be morally superior (his perogative, of course) doesn't mean it is necessarily ecologically so.   <br /> <br />In fact, this is probably even more the case on the marginal farm land out west that he mentions in his review than on land that has more potential to be fertile.  Ranches in the dryer parts of the west that for decades were sustainable cattle ranches have been converted into crops like mint, potatoes, and garlic - inoffensive to the sensibilities of vegetarians - only at the expense of massive irrigation (which damages the soil over time), and in most cases synthetic fertilization and pesticide use.  What's more, Polan focuses much of his attention on corn grown in the most fertile regions on the planet.  I can't see anyone making a convincing argument that one couldn't successfully pasture animals on this land.   <br /> <br />So, in short, if we eat organic or vegan or even 'beyond organic', this book may not provide us with easy reaffirmation of our own moral superiority.  It will expand our understanding of our place in the food chain in an invaluable way, and perhaps change the way we eat no matter what we're eating now! <br />
B00005UEAR|5.0|Take the versatile vocal styles of James LaBrie, the virtuosity of John Petrucci, forceful drumming of Mike Portnoy, excellent bass skills of John Myung, and interesting embellishments of Jordan Rudess' keyboard work and it makes for one great Dream Theater album.  You can tell they're taking full advantage of their production freedom. <br /> <br />The follow-up to SFAM, this album has it all.  \\"Dissapear\\" is a very artistic and emotional masterpiece that is reminescent of Radiohead.  \\"Solitary Shell\\" is a great song with a clash of  almpost poppy/upbeat melodies and lyrics that are almost depressing, but very interesting and intelligent.   <br /> <br />And you can't mention this album without \\"The Glass Prison\\".  It is the first installment in the Alcoholics Anonymous saga.  It was their heaviest song to date until Train of Though came out.  John Petrucci's guitar solos and in this song just blow me away everytime I hear them, along with the drum and vocal work. <br /> <br />The entire second disc is an epic about 6 people and the \\"inner turbulence\\" in their lives/minds.  The orchestration by Jordan Rudess is amazing.  The entire disc is unbelievably melodic with the exception of the heavy \\"War Inside My Head\\" and the frenzied \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" which sounds very much like Metallica.  James LaBrie even sounds like an early James Hetfield on this track. <br /> <br />There was a previous review that stated that there wasn't much worth listening to on this album and that the entire 2nd disc is junk.  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  If you're not a prog fan and like simple structures, timings, melodies...of course you won't like this album.  It's not for the simple-minded.  That said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album.  It's purely amazing...all 90 minutes of it.
B000FOQ0TG|5.0|This was a suprise to see at the local record store. This is queensryche's pinicle album, helping push the sucess of Empire, Operation mindcrime is the Hard Rocks answer for a story album as Pink Floyd had set precidence with the wall. This set includes the extended album (2002 remastered), a new live album (different than Operation Livecrime), and the Video Mindcrime DVD, which was a VHS tape I picked up long ago, and now digitally remastered.  I can only hope someday they release A Mindcrime I/II Live album (they probably have already thought of this), and expect this to potentially come as a set as well.  Excellent for someone that wants an excellent Mindcrime collection for one price, and a must for the Queensryche fan and collector.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since it's inception. The original series is the benchmark by which other sci-fi series are compared. When The Next Generation was introduced I was sceptical. I watched but only when I didn't have anything else to do and remebered when it was on, there was nothing that drew me to the show. I didn't particularly like any of the characters. Picard, Riker, Data, they were good character's but even after seven years they all seemed shallow and unrealistic. Kirk, Spock, Bones were all infinitely more realistic and believable.<br /><br />Paramount continued after TNG with DS9 and then Voyager and the same weakness permeated those shows as well. I noticed how it became common for the crew to develope some new method of modifiying thier equipment to fix thier problem, but it always made me feel like they hadn't overcome the problem just circumvented it. The answer to every problem can't be remodulating the shield harmonics or focusing a tetryon beam through the main deflector, and yet it was, a large majority of the time.<br /><br />Then I saw Babylon 5 and it assumed the spot right below TOS in my list of favorite shows. It had it's problems and was weak in some points but did more of what the other Star Trek shows should have done.<br /><br />I have since watched Firefly and the Battlestar Galactica redux each are very good in thier own right. Firefly is particularly well done rivaling Babylon 5 in it's enjoyment value and storytelling, it's character's are on par with Kirk and his crew, it was a very good, if short lived show.<br /><br />Then along comes Enterprise, which I initially didn't bother watching. I was so disappointed with the other newer Star Trek series and the fact that other shows had come out and easily overshadowed them that I new Enterprise would be an abismal failure, and to a degree it was a failure. But while deployed in Iraq with the National Guard I was sent the first season but I didn't even watch it until I got home, I even managed to get my wife to watch it and the only other Sci-Fi series she has ever been able to watch was Serenity, otherwise she hates Sci-Fi altogether. But then we started watching Enterprise and not only did my wife love it but I did as well.<br /><br />The characters are the best I've seen portrayed in any of the series, and any of the other series I have mentioned. The stories are phenomenal. The Enterprise, internaly, is the most realistic design I've seen yet. I served in the Navy on submarines for ten years prior to joining the National Guard and the Enterprise reminded me of being on one of my old boats, right down to movie night.<br /><br />I don't understand why other Star Trek Fans didn't seem to like the show. I did find some weaknesses, such as the episode with the Ferengi who have, in my view, been one of the worst things introduced into the Trek Universe. They were poorly concieved and equally poorly done, I never felt that Starfleet needed an entire race of moron's to contend with.<br /><br />Another weakness was the episode with the Borg a race just as useless as the Ferengi but for different reasons. The Borg were introduced to Starfleet by Q which I think was the greatest mistake that was ever perpetrated on the Star Trek Universe. The Borg are senseless machines and utterly worthless as characters. There is nothing to fear, nothing to hate, nothing to immortalize them, they are like the Enterprise D and Voyager, fantastic pieces of technology but with no emotional connection. And to try and maintian the link to the other series they were included in a very good Enterprise episode, it's only weakness being that they were in it.<br /><br />I have given Enterprise First Season five stars and the second season is equally spellbinding. The third season by this accounting would require seven or eight stars it is truly phenomenal and the fourth season looks promising.<br /><br />This is by far the best Star Trek series ever made, of course it wouldn't be quite as good if they had never made TOS but I think it would actually be better if they never made TNG, DS9 or Voyager. If you like Star Trek watch this series, if you don't like Sci-Fi, try this series, it is utterly fantastic.ade TOS but I think it would actually be better if they never made TNG, DS9 or Voyager. If you like Star Trek watch this series, if you don't like Sci-Fi, try this series, it is utterly fantastic.
B000F1IQN2|1.0|This film is based on real events, except the audience should have been warned that the film is \\"Very, Very, Very Loosely Based on Real Events.\\"  Anyone who has read the book \\"Vengeance,\\" which this movie gets its information from, will find themselves very perplexed.  Steven Spielberg has only reproduced approximately 90 percent of the book's content for the audience. <br /> <br />Five Israeli anti-terrorists are given a mission to hunt down and kill eleven men who were involved in the 1972 Olympic Munich Massacre.  However, many of the events protrayed in the movie hardly have any resemblance to the actual happenings.  In one episode, a terrorist is killed in a hotel room by an explosive device placed under his mattress.  In the film, after the bomb explodes, a honeymooning couple next door are staggering around in shock, covered in dust, half-naked, and the young wife is crying that she cannot see.  In reality, the damage was limited to the terrorist's room and the couple was never injured.   <br /> <br />Another bomb, which had been placed in a telephone, explodes with lots of noise and damage.  In reality, however, this bomb barely cracked a pane of window glass. <br /> <br />This continues on throughout the film.  In the film, the leader of the team, Avner, and his second, Carl, seemed to have little knowledge about the men they are supposed to kill, and sometimes wonder if the men on the death list are worthy of their penalty.  Again, in reality, Avner and Carl received lengthy briefings about each man on the list, were given all of the information the Mossad had, and then Avner and Carl briefed the rest of the members of the team. <br /> <br />I could go on and on.  What was Spielberg thinking?  Was there not enough drama in the real events?  Spielberg has two characters in the film shot in full, frontal nudity.  The only problem I have with this is that IT NEVER HAPPENED!  If Spielberg had read the book, which he claims he had, he would have known that oneof these characters was covered by a sheet and the other was wearing a bathrobe. <br /> <br />I give this film one star because it is not bad as films go.  However, in willfully ignoring the historical facts in making this film, Spielberg has done a disservice to the audience, and an even greater disservice to the men whose story this film is based on.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|I wrote a review for Enterprise Season One, that I intended to cover the entire four season collection of the show, but I felt an addendum for Season Three is required.<br /><br />This Season, alone, without the support of any of the other seasons, or any of the other series, for that matter. Is in my estimation the crowning achievment of the entire Star Trek Franchise. There are elements within the tale that draw from other episodes but thier impact on the story as a whole is minimal.<br /><br />I won't encapsulate the season, it's been done. I will elucidate and provide a few observations on individual aspects of the season.<br /><br />First I want to discuss the Xindi, a more realistic group of antagonists will be very difficult to find. They are well concieved, interesting and entirely believable. You'll find yourself liking most of them and understanding thier motives, however disagreeable they may be.<br /><br />Second is the Enterprise crew, specifically Archer. How do people react to stress, the loss of loved ones, the weight of an entire planet resting on your shoulders. These are the questions answered by the actions of the crew of Enterprise, and it is all handled brilliantly from the writing to the acting. You can feel and empathize with every emotion that the crew experiences. The amazing part is you can do the same with most of the Xindi you meet along the way.<br /><br />Third is Enterprise, I never thought I would feel so much affection for an imaginary ship other than the original NCC-1701. It reminds me of how I felt about the boats that I served aboard. I watched Voyager and the \\"Year in Hell\\" but the ship was a collection of pretty sets and nifty special effects. The original ship was a trusted companion, a guardian and a home. The NX-01 is all of these things and more and in season three her endurance is stretched to the limit, she is battered, beaten and injured along the way.<br /><br />Finally, the ride. This season is an entire story arc and it is fantastic. I mentioned Babylon 5 in my previous review and I'll bring it up again here. Because, although B5 didn't invent the serial style of story, with a grand arc that spanned more than a couple of episodes, it did revolutionaize bring it to Sci-Fi with it. Enterprise distilled that into a single season, and you feel yourself racing along with it. As if your on a roller coaster, racing from one weightless drop to the next, grinding your teeth through the loops and catching your breath, for that brief instant in between. If you have ever watched 24 you have an inkling of what it's like, electrifying, intense, unnerving and inspiring all at the same time. And they have carried this effect over into the fourth season although on a smaller scale.<br /><br />If you only want to try one season of Enterprise make it this one, it will not disappoint and besides, if you watch this one you'll want to see them all.ed Babylon 5 in my previous review and I'll bring it up again here. Because, although B5 didn't invent the serial style of story, with a grand arc that spanned more than a couple of episodes, it did revolutionaize bring it to Sci-Fi with it. Enterprise distilled that into a single season, and you feel yourself racing along with it. As if your on a roller coaster, racing from one weightless drop to the next, grinding your teeth through the loops and catching your breath, for that brief instant in between. If you have ever watched 24 you have an inkling of what it's like, electrifying, intense, unnerving and inspiring all at the same time. And they have carried this effect over into the fourth season although on a smaller scale. <br />If you only want to try one season of Enterprise make it this one, it will not disappoint and besides, if you watch this one you'll want to see them all.
B00005R62N|5.0|This live album which was recorded in 1979 sounds just as fresh as any live recording today.  All of the songs sound more amplified and metallic than the studio albums.  That is saying a lot because \\"Sad Wings...\\" and \\"Hell Bent...\\" are classics in their own right.  But to hear \\"Victim of Changes\\" live blows the studio recording out of the water!!  I love the studio version of \\"Victim...\\"., but the live version is more intense.  Most of the songs are played at a faster tempo, but the playing is not sloppy and Rob's vocals are fantastic!!  Any metal fan should own this!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This is Avril Lavigne's second album.  The cover photo is a little misleading---this is actually a fairly loud, fast-paced rock album, somewhat harder-rocking than her first album (\\"Let Go\\"), and there is indeed a touch of punk rock here.     Musically speaking, I think that this actually sounds slightly superior to her first album, because I think it not only has better instrumentalization, but also because Lavigne sounds distinctly more mature and does more creative, higher-quality vocals throughout the album.    Nearly all of the tracks are good songs and the singles (\\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"My Happy Ending,\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\") all did well.  Nevertheless, I'd have to rate this album just below \\"Let Go.\\"  This is because even though this album has the more sophisticated music, I just don't see any truly \\"stand-out\\" or memorable songs on it.    Overall, this is a good album.  It will appeal particularly well for Avril fans and female rock fans, especially those who are still hurting due to a break-up; but if I had to choose between \\"Under my Skin\\" and \\"Let Go,\\" I'd have to choose \\"Let Go.\\"
B000000H3Z|5.0|Wow, how didn't I get into this before?! I mean I had this over 6 months and I couldn't get into this that much. I first thought giving it 4 stars. But I mean, how can you not give this 5 stars?! Easily the best metal album of 1989 and my new favorite Sep album along with Arise.  <br /> <br />This is considered to be Sepultura's 1st masterpiece. I have to agree with that (although I think Schizophrenia was vastly underrated). It is a more mature effort than the first 2 and it has the best musicianship from any Sep album. Igor Cavalera does here a damn excellent performance, and shows again why he's one of the best metal drummers around. Andreas Kisser did here his best work (listen to the solos in Inner Self), the bass here is still pretty audible. Max Cavalera's vocals are not at their best (for that go for Chaos A.D.) but they are nowhere near as bad as those of Derek Green (avoid any of these Sep albums). Also considering these guys were around 19 years old when they released this classic! This album is probably their heaviest. It just never slows down. This was definetly one of the heaviest albums of the 80's (along with Slayer's, Kreator's and Death's albums). The only complaint here is about 'Hungry' which kinda falls flat on it's as s compared to the others. I won't go now for all the songs bu I'll say 'Inner Self' is the best song here, it has an awesome change of melodes and the best solo from the album. The title track has also an kick a ss intro, too. But anyway it's one of the best extreme thrash bands give a phenomenal performance here. If you call yourself a thrash-metalhead and have to hear this album yet, don't talk to me till you have this. <br /> <br />Best 3 songs (in order): <br />Inner Self <br />Stronger Than Hate <br />Beneath the Remains
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I heard Eric Church the first time live in Minneapolis at the annual Aquatennial celebration concert. He was very genuine and friendly, and he explained his personal connection to every song and the history behind how he wrote the song. His singing is amazing, and his live performance is the best I have seen in several years! I recommend the album and I look forward to his success in entering the country music scene.
B000004166|5.0|This is an excellent set put out by Philips in it's renowned Duo cd class.  Almost all of Mozart's violin works are here.  Arthur Grumiaux, one of my favorites, does a superb job of interpreting Mozart's works.  This last weekend I played the same works by Heifitz and the comparison makes for interesting listening.  I can't say one is better than the other, specially since I have no formal training in music, but each artist definitely leaves an impression.<br /><br />Excellent set and a superb value but most importantly makes a valuable addition to anyone's collection.
B000002H33|4.0|I'm not really a fan to Metallica. I only like about 5 songs they produced which includes ORION, ENTER SANDMAN, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, UNFORGIVEN, and GOD THAT FAILED. I'll give this 4 stars because this has Orion which rocks!! Buy this with the other 4 songs from the Black Album today.
0131479415|5.0|Recently someone asked me if I knew of any trainers in agile estimation techniques in my geographical area.  I strongly recommended that he engage Mike Cohn and if Mike were unavalable to purchase a copy of this excellent book.  I had the fortune of being an early reviewer of the book, and am not disappointed in the final product.  If the book Planning eXtreme Programming was the skeleton, this book is the meat that provides excellent coverage of the following:     * estimation techniques in terms of time and effort   * business valuation of stories   * release planning   * iteration planning    I highly recommend this books to all agile teams.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|I attended this tour and the show seemed better at the time. Still worth having, but a few points: <br />-Why did they cut Astronomy Domine and Hey You? They should have left them in and taken out the stuff from Momentary Lapse of Reason, which we have seen already on DSOT. <br />--The sax player DOES NOT have a ridiculous mullet like the dude in DSOT. <br />__What;s with the percussion player jumping around like a madman? <br />--Some of the lighting is too bright and harsh, it washes out the show. <br />--The DVD sound is decent, not spectacular like I was hoping. <br />All in all, worth having, but not the greatest. <br />You really need to have Live at Pompeii. <br />--Just my 2 cents
B00003CY6M|5.0|Just finished watching this movie for the umpteenth time!  I'll try not to be long about this review, but I simply MUST give this 5 stars!  I'm all about fate, believing each of us has a purpose and if we play our cards right and listen for the signs we'll find what's right.  So, along comes Serendipity!  Two people reach for the same gloves and all through the movie, see the signs, following with SUCH close calls.<br /><br />It's an encouraging film, telling us to let loose gain wisdom by \\"being willing to be seen as foolish and stupid\\".  In other words, follow your heart!  It's the opinions of others that messes us up, if we listen to their voices instead of our own, how will we ever know our own hearts and minds?  Make mistakes to learn, follow your heart and see what happens!<br /><br />Great romantic comedy, a variety of wonderful, strange and sometimes absurd characters.  And, like \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", the other man/woman isn't a bad person, it isn't about choosing the good one, it's about choosing the one that's good for YOU.  Crazy, wonderfully interconnected plot, I LOVE it!
B0002W18MU|5.0|I do a good job of moving on. Of losing interest in old emotions. Getting bored with them. Having new life experiences, friends and joys put down sediment, in layers, wistfully burying the old dinosaur bones - bones that were once called into action by a vibrant owner endowed with an elan vital.  Now the bones are encapsulated in an oubliette - an oubliette created by the desire to forget, or by the imperceptible sensation that these memories are no longer relevant, no longer a part of the ego now in existence. Memories rendered innocuous by their very age. Memories that belonged to someone else, not I.<br /><br />Until an artist arrives, able to lift those capsules from the depths of my mind, barely moving the surface.<br /><br />It's been a while since a song made me cry. And it's been a fair while since I had anything to cry about. That makes it even more unexpected. But I've just acquired American V: A Hundred Highways. Released July 4th, 2006, this is the album upon which Johnny Cash had been working when he perished in the September of 2003. His wife had passed in the May of that year, ending 35 years of marriage. Johnny died on the day the final mix of Unearthed was completed.<br /><br />The song is If You Could Read My Mind. I've heard it before; I know it's a cover. But, like an amusing anecdote, an inordinate amount of the song's affection is derived from the power of the artiste. And Johnny's rendition energised the forgotten melancholies of my mind, floating them gently to the surface. Not sorrowfully, but in recognition. It is good to feel again. To be alive. Johnny's voice, weak and vulnerable in the winter of his mesmeric fifty-year career, only serves to heighten the impact. I remember again.<br /><br />If you get the opportunity, buy this CD and listen to this song. The lyrics may be reusable, but the performance is irreplaceable.
0743442539|5.0|The book that really launched le Carre's career as a writer is a classic of the 'spy genre', but also demonstrates why that genre produces so many excellent writers - le Carre, Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, Alan Furst, and Robert Littel to name a few. Human desires, principles, compromises, morality, amorality, and sexuality are all on display.<br /><br />The Spy Who Came in From the Cold set the standard for the multi-layered spy novel. As the story unfolds, the reader must attempt to decide what is really going on. Is Alec Leamas really a defector or on a covert deception mission? Does he really know fully what he is doing? Is East German counter-intelligence master, the despicable Mundt, the target of the deception or is he really an English spy? Is it a double-game? A triple-play? Is Leamas really in love?<br /><br />Highest recommendation for fans of the spy genre or fine writing anywhere.

B000BNX3B4|1.0|This is truly a \\"dog\\" of a movie, but i purchased this for the advertised gag reel.  Hello!  A gag reel implies at least a couple of bloopers; this had only one (the scene where Elizabeth Perkins throw a package of meat at John Cusack). Although that blooper in itself was hilarious I was expecting more. Darn.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|\\"From Me To You\\" exists in true stereo so why not release it already? The mix sounds good! -I have it on rare foreign vinyl. Since this CD doesn't conform to a format of original mono and stereo single releases \\"From Me To You\\" in true stereo and \\"Help!\\" and \\"Ticket To Ride\\" in original mono single mixes would have made this a worthy addition to the Beatle CD collector who already has all the EMI CDs and Capitol 1 and 2 box sets. If you've got all the back catalogue already I can't see the point of buying this. Please release all the original historic mixes before flooding the market with new redundant product and new digital remasters! Not always does Digital Remaster = Good Product.
0156030209|5.0|As a college student, I really dont have any time to read pleasure books unless its the summer, so I have to really pick out good books or else I feel that I have wasted my time... and this book was NO waste of time.   <br /> <br />As some may agree, the little was a bit slow, but the part about Pi's religious adventures stirs it up a bit.  The book doesnt really get going though until the 2nd phase.  Here is where the action picks up, and the reader's interest does as well.  The last 20 pages of the book are the bread and butter of this book though.  I dont want to spoil it to anyone, but its the type of book that you will want to discuss with your peers, no matter how old you are. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great summer read.
0062502182|1.0|this book isn't awful but i'm giving it one star to bring it down to a proper average of 2.5 stars. do real 'fables' contain taglines that declare themselves \\"a fable about ...ing your own ....\\"? i don't think so.  what if aesop had titled his work \\"aesop's fables: how to live a happier/healthier/more enlightened life\\"? sounds pretty absurd, doesn't it?<br /><br />this book is just one more on a long list of watery eastern mystical philosophy-meets-western self-improvement books. nothing terribly offensive or interesting here because there is nothing new here either.  unless you're the kind of person that doesn't read.
B00013RC9I|2.0|I've had this album for a year now, hoping my initial view of it would change, but it hasn't. I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the overall sound of this album sounds like a parody of their music. Not only that, it feels thin, formulaic, and lacking tasteful re-invention of their musical influences  compared to their previous releases. Alpha Beta Gaga stood out the most for me on this album; a pretty sweet whistle tune,  actually. If your new to AIR check out Premiers Symptomes first and go from there. You'll find some warm, dreamy, soulful instrumentation a la Serge Gainsbourg. Do not visit Montreal without this music!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|i recommend this movie to no one with good reason and its not because of the gore or torture scenes because thats what i went to see if your going to watch this movie for gore and terror you will be so disappointed because theres about 25 minutes of torture scenes if that the rest is more like a porn which dont get me wrong isnt a bad thing if your watching an actual porno if anyone can actually like this movie you have to seriously check your horror movie taste or movie taste period
0440241588|1.0|I never previously read a book (certainly not from John Grisham), which was so an utterly waste of time. <br />Throughout the book, I was anticipating that the actual page turning suspense would start any minute. However, after about 300 pages I realized it was going to end as it started : with nothing. <br />If you intend to buy it, don't. If you already bought it, burn it.
0670888656|4.0|<br /> <br />I never thought I'd say this about a book, but the movie was better - the one starring Spencer Tracey.  I appreciate the subdued style of 19th century literature, but this offered little in the way of memorable descriptions of  or insights into either Hyde's or Jekyll's mental state. It really seems like Stevenson put little thought or effort into writing this one.  I also get irritated when authors ignore such fundamental scientific concepts as the conservation of mass - Jekyll shrinks when he becomes Hyde.  Comic-book science fiction does it all the time, but I expect better from a serious author.   <br /> <br />According to the \\"About the author\\" at the end of the book, Stevenson won international fame from this book.  Perhaps for the time, the insight that we have an evil personality within us was so new that this story deserves this fame.  Since it is short, it is worth reading.          <br />(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)
B000F7CMRM|5.0|But don't take my word for it.  Scroll down a little and check out the Review from Maram from Qatar.  He's really trippin'.  If it triggers the Arab hatred, it must be close to the mark, eh, Maram?  Are those your two wives there, walking five feet behind you?
0800141660|5.0|S&S was the first adaptation of an Austen novel I saw, and I liked it immensely - still do. <br /> <br />Several other critics have found fault with Emma Thompson's age, stating that she was too old for the part; allow me to comment on this: <br /> <br />Thompson is not the only actor who is accused of being too old to play one of Austen's heroines. To me, it often seems to be the other way around: Elinor is surprisingly young for such a sensible young woman. <br /> <br />We don't have to look very far for the reason, however: Compared to us people had very shortened life spans in the ages before the invention of modern medicine. Just think of Mrs. Bennet (in Pride & Prejudice) who is permanently afraid of her husband's death of old age, although he is in his late forties or early fifties at most. <br /> <br />As people's lives were shorter and their world much smaller than ours it is not to be wondered at that characters in Austen's novels who are some twenty years old, appear surprisingly adult to us. <br /> <br />One way to compensate for this is to cast actors who are quite a bit older. If not, trouble often results; just look at Keira Knightley who *is* in the right age bracket and decidedly too immature to play Elizabeth Bennet (Pride & Prejudice again). <br />Emma Thompson on the other hand is completely convincing as Elinor.
0596007124|5.0|This book absolutely rocks!  I truly have a passion for software development, but I find most books to be just plain dry and boring.  This book takes a light-hearted and fun \\"Sesame Street\\" type approach to teaching design patterns.  If you want to learn more about this subject and have fun doing it, you won't find a better book!  It's not only fun, the examples make it very easy to understand the core concepts of design patterns.  You won't find this type of approach in the Gang of Four book or Sun's \\"Core J2EE Patterns\\" book.  If I were designing a computer science curriculum for a university, this book would be required reading!
B00005IC2H|5.0|With nearly 300 reviews of this CD already written, and no one but the most deranged fan willing to read more than a few, why add another? Well, because I suspect there are listeners other than myself who look and listen and wonder how to decipher all the woozy praise or hysterical hatred. Besides, of course, buying the darn thing and listening.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Sigur Ros for over 4 years, having been exposed to them by my daughter, who thought this right up my alley. And she was blindingly right. I have witnessed them twice live. This is amazing stuff. Now, not everything they do is amazing....some of it is rather pedestrian. Tedious. A little embarrassing. Even Mozart wrote uninteresting music. But there is nothing dull on this CD. It is transcendent and intoxicating. Their consistently best work to date.<br /><br />I do not believe snippets or scraps can really capture what this can do. You need to immerse yourself into the world they create, a sonic palace of bizarre digital noises and weird little drones, a wispy little vocalist and a breathtakingly brilliant percussionist, and savor it all. Unlike anything else, and unrelated to anything else, it stands on its own as something worth experiencing and enjoying.<br /><br />Sigur Ros is like a Jackson Pollack painting. Often when you look at a Pollack, not a print but the real thing, you wonder what the heck he thought he was up to. He got paid for that? But sometimes Pollack hit it perfectly; he took the same old swirls and drips and spatters on every painter's dropcloth and produced something gorgeous and permanent. This CD has all winners on it, a flow and a movement using the the most elementary, and often most repetitive, little sounds and weaving and blending them into a tapestry of endlessly surprising and often unimaginable beauty.
6304981635|5.0|This is the best martial arts movie ever made. There is none of that wire work mess or computer generated effects. Bruce Lee is the greatest martial artist to ever live and this is his best film. If you are looking for a great martial arts film this is it. Bruce Lee was truely dedicated to whatever he did and there will never be another martial artist like him. Rest in peace Bruce.
B000002P6R|4.0|There's not too much to add to Grigory's Girl review-i hadn't heard this one in over 20 years and it is an outstanding album. How Can You Do It Alone, Don't let GO of The Coat,Just Another Tricky Day, You Better You Bet, Daily Records are the highlghts & a fantastic version of How Can You Do It Alone, which is quite a bit different than the studio version, with a vocal rap and some guitar as only Mr. Peter Townshend can deliver. Like several of the Stones underappreciated efforts-Goat's Head Soup, Black And Blue, Steel Wheels if this was done by a new band critics would have outdone themselves in lavishing praises.
B000A5044C|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Keiko is a single mother living with her four children (all from different fathers) in a cramped apartment she's recently rented in a middle class section of Tokyo.  Fearful that they will be thrown out onto the streets if the neighbors or landlord discover the existence of the kids, she makes the three youngest ones stay indoors and out of sight while the oldest, 12-year-old Akira, is allowed to venture out to run errands and enjoy at least some semblance of a normal life.  None of the children attend school.  Despite his youth, Akira, in many ways, has been forced to assume the role of parent, providing for the other children while Keiko stays away for months at a time, ostensibly earning money working (though we are inclined to speculate that there may be a far more nefarious truth behind the absences that is never fully revealed to us).<br /><br />Based on a true story, \\"Nobody Knows\\" is more of an observational study on human behavior than a full-fledged narrative; it is a film that uses the minutiae of everyday life, rather than heavy-handed plot points, to generate its drama.  As virtual prisoners in their own apartment, the children survive as best they can without adult supervision or guidance.  Indeed, in its own quiet way, the film serves as an allegory of a much larger issue, a stinging indictment against a society that too often abandons and neglects its children to pursue its own selfish interests - most often to devastating and disastrous results both for the youngsters themselves and for the society as a whole.<br /><br />Beautifully written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, this is a heartrending film filled with moments of quiet perceptions and unforgettable images.  The actors portraying the children are all truly amazing - wholly natural, unaffected and believable in front of the camera.  Yuya Yagira, as young Akira, is basically called on here to carry the film and he does so in a way that leaves one awestruck and breathless.  His is an exquisitely internalized performance, serious and stoic on the outside, yet with a sly mischievousness that peeks through from time to time to remind us that Akira is really just a kid at heart, forced to grow up much too fast and assume the mantle of adult responsibility that the actual \\"adults\\" around him have been all too eager to abandon.  What's so heartbreaking about this film is watching these sweet (but never cloying) children being deprived of all the true essentials of a happy childhood - freedom, fresh air, open space, education, even food and electricity, not to mention the all-important feeling of security and belonging that comes with the love and guidance of a fully engaged parent.  Yet, although they yearn for all these things, the children seem to accept their plight with a sort of uncomplaining fatalism combined with a love of one another and a resourcefulness and spirit of survival that is both astonishing and inspiring.<br /><br />Nothing about \\"Nobody Knows\\" is ever obvious or underlined, not its message and certainly not its emotions.  These seep into the film gradually and unobtrusively so as not to disturb the near-documentary nature of the movie.  We feel almost as if we are eavesdropping on the children, as if we were the very neighbors from whom they are trying so desperately to hide.  There's no point in denying that the movie requires patience from the viewer, for it achieves its power subtly and slowly, through an artfully arranged accumulation of activities and details.  Yet, this is precisely what draws us into the world of the film and makes us, finally, not mere observers but rather empathetic participants with the characters.<br /><br />It takes time to get to where it's going, but \\"Nobody Knows\\" will leave an indelible mark on your heart.ly internalized performance, serious and stoic on the outside, yet with a sly mischievousness that peeks through from time to time to remind us that Akira is really just a kid at heart, forced to grow up much too fast and assume the mantle of adult responsibility that the actual \\"adults\\" around him have been all too eager to abandon.

B00006LPER|4.0|Being a piano teacher myself, I was very curious about this film. I don't teach in a conservatory, but do know that artists at that level can become very eccentric, and when they feel threatened, they can be vicious. Still, this film took that to the extreme and then some. Erika's relationship with her mother didn't make it any easier to achieve mental health, and her sexual fantansies and perversions drove her deeper into the abyss. By all outward appearances, she was a repressed, uptight bully with most of her students who went home to a quiet life with her equally repressed, bullying mother, but she often sneaked out at night to act out her fantasies. It's when an attractive student takes a romantic interest in her that she decides she can use him to act out her ultimate fantasies of being beaten and abused to an extreme. She controls him cruelly until he agrees to follow through. Some of this is hard to watch, but the film is never judemental, and Erika's humanity is always there. As twisted as she has become, she is never a caricature or a two-dimensional character. This is a very dark, very adult tale that left me a little shaken, as I'm sure was intended.
B00007LTIA|5.0|<br /> <br />I only want to say one thing. And I am writing in english  <br />for all folks understand me. I am really tired of read  <br />sick reviews here in amazon and from other sources, about that it is a bad album, boring or a disaster. **This is far the best Yes Album ever **, perhaps not for everyone, but clasical music is not for everyone too, and this not mean that it is bad or boring or a disaster. <br /> <br />Please have respect for the wonderful Tales from Topographics <br />Ocean, and many thanks to Jon Anderson and Steve Howe for <br />this epic effort.
068817776X|5.0|Edith Hahn of Vienna has several family members depart for Palestine and England shortly after the Anschluss.  For love, of her mother (Klothilde) and boyfriend (Pepi) she stays until it's too late (and they are too poor) to depart themselves. <br /> <br />Through amazing luck and friendship she manages to obtain falsified documents and live as an Aryan housewife during the Holocaust. <br /> <br />I've read many stories of Holocaust survivors, but, this is the first I've read of a \\"U-Boat\\" someone hiding in plain sight. It gives you a picture (from a Jewish point of view) into why 'average' citizens of the Reich so easily followed the path led by the Nazi party. (Some shockingly trivial) While reinforcing your belief in humanity as many of those same people helped Ms. Hahn at great risk to themselves. <br /> <br />A truly touching story that I find myself mentally revisiting many days after finishing the book.
B00000I8UF|5.0|I have to agree with Nero.  There isn't a bad track on Moanin'...I actually think it gets better with each tune.  If you don't have this in your collection or want to introduce someone to top-notch jazz, buy this CD.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|I'm not writing this to give you a blow-by-blow, others have done a better job of reviewing this disc set. I just wanted to say that I bought this set for the amazing price of $150 at Best Buy. My only gripe (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that you can't \\"play all\\" episodes on the discs. You have to choose them one by one which is really annoying. None of my other TV series DVD's are like this.<br /><br />However, I'm just glad to have posession of such an amazing series.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I started out a YES freak @ the age of 14 in'77' Yes' 1st song I recall was 'Starship Trooper'. From then on I was hooked! So begins my admitted biased critique of 'Tales' When I 1st heard this Album around about '79' I thought 'this might be a little out there. After listening to the whole set (4 songs)a couple times I came to realize there were 2 excellent masterpieces in my opinion. 'Revealing Science of God' & 'Ritual'. Those 2 songs, like many other yes songs were more like Journeys. I never was a 'pop' fan & these definitely dont fit that category. These were flowing epics of beauty. These artisit are perfectionists & play so well together. This album illistrates when they hit the 'Zone' as in my 2 aforementioned songs. & also when they went over the edge, As in the ancient & the remembering. I still have a hard time listening to those. I read previous critiques praising the imagery & philosophy behind those 2 songs, they sold me into getting this again. But I like to listen with my mind on auotpilot & let the music take me. Not have to study to try & like something. 'Revealing' flows. As Jon Anderson once said in an early interview. his lyrics are more word notes, not necessarily said to mean anything, but to fit the melody of the music(I'm paraphrasing). Thats how I prefer to listen to this. His opening mantra ascends to a symphonical climax where the band continues those heights to his closing exit. Now I do get meaning out of the lyrical side. But thats not what I look for. Music to me is freedom & why get bound to one aspect when all the dimensions  set you free. Great music takes grabs me & pulls me along for the ride, not make me 'look' for it.  Ritual' to me is a love song. I've paralleled that with so many relationships in the past.  Now I see it as a relationship with my God. This music can do many different things with other people. Thats what it does for me! & will continue to do! Revealing & Ritual were more than enough to let me relive this over& over again! My taste are varied now days. I'm a big fan from Stevie Ray Vaughn to Boney James. So you see I like talent. 'YES' billows with talent. This cd is fine fine example of unsurpassed musical excellence few artistst to this day have equaled!
B000F48CD8|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst albums I have ever listened to in my life.  I decided to check this band out because I liked \\"Steady As She Goes\\", but that is the only good song on this CD.  Everything else is just garbage.  There just doesn't seem to be any effort put into the songs at all.  They all just feel so empty and lifeless A.K.A. Dull And Boring. <br />Thank God I was able to listen to the album with my Napster subscription and didn't make the huge mistake of buying this terrible album. <br />Sorry to those who love this album; I just don't like it.
B000EGCITQ|5.0|She gives it to you straight and has the guts to say the things we all wish we could say. Not only is this CD Pink's most blatent statement to date, she holds nothing back which is so refreshing in comparison to all of the shallow \\"music\\" the industry is trying to pass off these days. The 14 tracks on the unedited version hold their own with some great insight into Pink's mindset when this was written, and anyone who can't see the power behind the song \\"Dear Mr. President\\" must be blind (or a Bush supporter).A great addition to any collection. I was fortunate to see her live in NY and encourage anyone who is able, to catch the show, you will not be disappointed.
B000001GXL|5.0|One man's view:  I feel I've never heard these pieces before when I put this CD on. ABM's approach is magical to me. He's forceful yet somehow graceful and fluid. Assured. Precise. I find I want to play his CDs just to hear his touch on the piano. It's like a swim in healing tropical waters. Highly recommended!

0812580346|4.0|Flashforward starts with a whoppingly large temporal anomaly - the entire human race lives 2 minutes in their future selves, that future being roughly 20 years from now.  When the anomaly is over, chaos ensues: planes and cars have crashed, security cameras have gone haywire, and no one knows what caused the event.  No one, that is, except the heroes of the story, who are a group of scientists performing an experiment to produce the highest-energy conditions ever created by man.  Theo Procopides and Lloyd Simcoe are particle physicists working at the particle accelerator in Switzerland.  As they initiate their experiment, Lloyd has a vision of his future wife (a woman he'd not yet met), while Theo sees nothing.  Theo later learns that he's been murdered by the time of the visions, and so had no future self to jump into.  The mystery is on - both the Big Question mystery of what caused the event (and how to interpret the future visions), as well as the smaller mystery of who will kill Theo. <br /> <br />Naturally, the look into the future brings forth the debate about the nature of space-time and whether the multi-universe model or the fixed universe model is more accurate.  Sawyer does well in negotiating and explaining the science behind the models, although as a chemist I can see a few holes in his science.  No matter, the story is well written and avoids some obvious pitfalls (which plagued his earlier \\"Terminal Experiment\\"), such as trying to explain too much and trying to jab too many theories at the reader.  Oddly, religion plays little role in the debate, which is a mainstay of other Sawyer works.  I find this odd - surely a few billion people would interpret their vision as a divine work, rather than the result of an experiment. <br /> <br />I have to admit to a certain level of scientific frustration, however.  It's not so much that Sawyer doesn't understand the science thoroughly (perhaps he does, and decided to gloss over certain points in the interest ofthe story).  Rather, Sawyer makes the mistake of giving his arguments to the wrong characters.  Surely Lloyd Simcoe, the particle physicist, would not be so cavalier about dismissing quantum theory.  He works in the realm of quantum mechanics, and would surely be biased towards a quantum worldview rather than a relativistic one!  Again, this is likely only to bother those of us (chemists and physicists) who are more comfortable with quantum theory. <br /> <br />Overall, on the scale of Sawyer offerings, this one is quite strong.  It is not as good as \\"Calculating God\\", but certainly better than the second \\"Hominids\\" book, and better than \\"Terminal Experiment\\" as well.
B0002OERI0|2.0|NOTE!!: I am a \\"medium\\" Green Day fan and enjoy Green Day albums such as Dookie and Nimrod, but as for this album..:    I'd give it 1.75 but psh whatever. Okay so this album got basically everything an album could possibly recieve as rewards, praise, etc. and why? No no, not because their Green Day, and not because the the barely recognizable political message, but because of 3 songs \\"Wake Me Up When Sept. Ends\\" \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulivard of Broken Dreams\\". Okay so the first one that got really noticed was \\"American Idiot\\" but i'm not counting that one. So Boulivard of Broken Dreams gets noticed, and guess what? It TAKES OVER the radio station I listen to! So yeah I had to hear that song alot and got tired of it. THEN seemingly at the same time, the next 2 worse songs on the album make a blitz on the mainstream at the same time. I could just die if I heard some dweeb kid sing Holiday or September ends one more time. I bet people had to buy a second single album of Holiday because they listened to the first single of it they bought to d*mn MUCH!     Now don't get me wrong! there are some good songs on here..\\"Homecoming\\" and \\"She's a Rebel\\" are the good ones. Why they didn't get noticed, I don't know! But I'm glad they didnt, because now i can listen to them and not hafta pull out my hair because i've heard it a billion times! so people take a moment, and realize that the only songs that got this album its SupaFame! are \\"Boulivard..\\" \\"Holiday\\" and  \\"Wake me up...\\"    OVERALL!! This album would be great I think if it just didn't have those three songs that played over..and over..and over...and over..and over...and over again
0060931671|1.0|Like it or not, I sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  Thomas Pynchon is one of those.  If the Crying of Lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  Lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  It's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  I am very well aware that, Pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  The problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  He is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  My answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  The problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  Finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  There is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader.
038551123X|2.0|Excellent idea (serial killer who kills only other serial killers and who works for the police) but poorly executed. Some times the characters did things that seemed out of character or just stupid. For example, Dexter's sister wonders how he knows so much about serial killers and instead of telling her that he learned it in say, training for his job (which would totally make sense) he tries to avoid the question. Why? If he is a sociopath who pretends to be \\"human\\" than he should be able to deflect questions that simple! Also: the author tends to repeat himself. A lot. In a single paragraph. For example: he talks about underestimating someone. Then he talks about HOW he underestimated them. Then he repeats \\"I underestimated her.\\". We got it the first time! I feel like the intended audience of this book is a nonreader. Prolific readers or even people with an appreciation/awareness of language will find this poorly written.    Frustrating. I am looking forward to the series, Dexter, on Showtime this Fall, though. Maybe that will have better writing.

B00065GX64|5.0|Watching Fritz Lang's \\"M\\" for the first time, I was struck by how contemporary the film felt.  This is a movie that could have easily been shot yesterday, in terms of both subject matter and editing technique. <br /> <br />The genres of police procedural, psychological portrait, and social satire are all integrated into a captivating story of a child killer (Peter Lorre) hunted by both the law and the lawless.  Lorre's character was an amalgamation of several serial killers that had been terrifying Germany during interim period between the two World Wars.  This and other facts of historical importance are illuminated by the interesting, if slightly dry, commentary of film scholars Eric Rentschler and Anton Kaes, as well as a booklet with reactions to \\"M\\" from the period and a Lang essay and interview. <br /> <br />The bonus features on disc two are for the most part superb.  Most notable is film of a Fritz Lang interview which is gorgeously photographed as well as captivating (Lang is a charming, if factually dubious, storyteller). Also of note is \\"M\\" editor Paul Falkenburg doing commentary on excerpts from the film for students. His dry wit and on-location anecdotes contrast nicely with academic commentary of Rentschler and Kaes. The only weak spot on is an homage short \\"M le Maudet\\" by Claude Chabrol which is (to put it kindly) embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br />The reputation of Criterion DVDs for high quality transfer and extra features is an earned one and the re-release of \\"M\\" is no exception, highly recommended. <br /> <br />-A. Rust <br />
0385510454|3.0|\\"My background is law, certainly not satellites or espionage ... I know very little about spies, electronic surveillance, satellite phones, smart phones, bugs, wires, mikes, and the people who use them. If something in this novel approaches accuracy, it's probably a mistake.\\"  - Author John Grisham on THE BROKER<br /><br />I give high marks to the author for the engaging honesty of his disclaimer. However, until he improves his background knowledge of the espionage game, perhaps Grisham should leave the genre to such writers as John le Carre and Gerald Seymour. And I don't mean this unkindly since, after all, Grisham can do stories about lawyers and the law better than the latter two.<br /><br />Here in THE BROKER, lawyer Joel Backman, a former top-tier power player in Washington, D.C., is given a presidential pardon during the last hours of the departing Chief Executive's term. Six years earlier, Backman had acted as broker for JAM, a computer program created by three brilliant Pakistani computer hackers who'd stumbled upon a mysterious web of surveillance satellites and managed to write software that gained control of it. Most disturbing to the CIA and the Pentagon was the fact that the system hadn't been launched by the U.S.; its national origin was unknown. Since Backman was muddying the waters and needed to be put on ice, he was thrown into a federal pen on trumped up charges. Now, after engineering Joel's pardon, the CIA is prepared to set him up with a new identity in Italy, staking him out like a sacrificial goat to see who comes to kill him; the killer would presumably represent the country that had put the satellite net into orbit. Was it the Russians, Saudis, Chinese, or the Israelis?<br /><br />The sacrificial goat doesn't suspect a thing, even after various assassins employed by the suspect governments pick up the trail and begin to converge on the city. Indeed, way too much of THE BROKER follows Joel, now known as \\"Marco\\", as he lives his new set-up life in Bologna learning Italian and eating at charming restaurants, all at the expense of Luigi, whom Joel/Marco presumes to be his CIA minder.<br /><br />THE BROKER has two insurmountable flaws. First, I, as the reader, never achieved sympathy with Joel, the plot's ostensible \\"hero\\". Joel getting whacked promised a \\"ho-hum\\" reaction from me. Second, Grisham sets in motion a bevy of world-class killers, especially Sammy Tin working for the Beijing mandarins, and then virtually ignores them up to and including the very end.<br /><br />Accompanying John Grisham's disclaimer quoted at the beginning of this review was his admission that he loves everything Italian. So, perhaps understandably, the best thing about this novel is the poor-man's tour of Bologna that John takes us on while following Joel/Marco around. It did inspire me to eat lunch at one of my local trattorias, and I hope the inheritor of my copy of THE BROKER will excuse the occasional pasta sauce stain.-up life in Bologna learning Italian and eating at charming restaurants, all at the expense of Luigi, whom Joel/Marco presumes to be his CIA minder.  <br /> <br />THE BROKER has two insurmountable flaws.

B0002W18MU|5.0|These songs were recorded while Johnny Cash was wheelchair-bound, nearly blind, asthmatic, diabetic, in constant pain and grieving the death of his soulmate and love of his life June Carter Cash, whom he would join mere weeks after the last of these tracks was recorded. Despite all that, he managed, through sheer force of will, to create an album of honesty and beauty that will stay with you long after the last note fades. <br /> <br />The album opens with a straightfoward appeal for help. \\"Oh Lord, help me to walk another mile, just one more mile\\" he sings on \\"Help Me\\", a hauntingly beautiful song that is neither maudlin nor overly sentimental. This is followed by what the sequencing seems to suggest is God's answer to that humble plea, the slashing, foot-stomping \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\". Cash seems to relish the role of the avenging hand and sings this one with gusto. <br /> <br />\\"Like the 309\\", the last song Cash wrote and recorded, has him returning to the \\"train song\\" motif that has been a lifeblood of his music. Cash stares down \\"Dr. Death\\" with a wink, a sly grin and a clear-eyed view of his own mortality. \\"Tell me all about it, what I did wrong/Meanwhile, I will be doin' fine/Then load my box on the 309\\". <br /> <br />Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\", a staple of light-pop radio, is transformed by Cash from a pleasantly hummable song about a romantic breakup into a harrowing trip into a dark night of the soul. Cash's voice is at its weakest here as he struggles for breath and pitch but that only serves to make the effect greater. Lyrics that seemed throwaway in the original seem weighted with years of regret and pain when sung by Cash. His voice breaks and nearly disappears while singing \\"The feeling's gone/And I just can't get it back\\" and \\"If you read between the lines/You'll know that I'm just trying to understand\\". <br /> <br />Cash takes Bruce Springsteen's \\"Further On Up the Road\\" from \\"The Rising\\" and turns it into the song it was always meant to be. What was a hard-driving rock song when done by Springsteen becomes, in Cash's hands, an instantly classic folk song that sounds like it was handed down through the years. The melody is allowed to breathe, the lyrics are clear and beautiful and the song becomes a meditation on life, faith and redemption. \\"If there's a light up ahead/well, brother, I don't know/But I'll meet you further on up the road\\". <br /> <br />The specter of June Carter Cash hovers over many songs on the album, notably \\"On the Evening Train\\" (the Hank Williams song about a widower sending off his wife's casket at the depot), \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\" and \\"Rose of My Heart\\" (\\"We're the best partners this world's ever seen... You are the rose of my heart/You are the love of my life\\" ). \\"Four Strong Winds\\", with its lyrics \\"Now our good times are all gone/And I'm bound for moving on\\" takes on a different meaning altogether from its original \\"good love gone bad\\" connotation. <br /> <br />The album closes with \\"I'm Free From the Chain Gang Now\\", a song Cash originally recorded in 1962. Back then, in the hands of a young man, the song was simply about a prisoner released from his shackles. Now, as recorded by an old man with his soulmate gone, his health gone and his best days behind him, the song is about freedom from earthly bonds. I don't think it's a coincidence that Cash's voice sounds strongest on this track. When he sings \\"I got rid of the shackles that bound me\\" he sounds like a man who has made peace with his past and is looking forward to moving on to the next station. On September 12, 2003 Johnny Cash was freed from his earthly shackles but, to our great benefit, he had the strength and talent to leave behind some sublime beauty for the rest of us. I love you, John. I'll meet you further on up the road.
B00008K7AM|1.0|I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.<br /><br />I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.<br /><br />If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.<br /><br />The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...<br /><br />Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.<br /><br />Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.

B00069A5GE|5.0|I bought this because of my positive experience with the Dire Straits' \\"Brothers In Arms\\" 5.1 DVD that I bought (and reviewed) after years of being happy with the standard stereo version.  The 5.1 rendition played through my home theater was a revelation, making the experience of hearing songs that I have known for years seem like the first time. The layers of instrumentation are more separate as the sounds come at you from so many angles, while still being unified as a whole.<br /><br />Audio-wise, the \\"Sailing to Philedelphia\\" 5.1 DVD gave me the same revelation that I got from the \\"B.I.A.\\" disc.  You just hear so much more when it is not all compressed into two speakers.  Knopfler's vocals really sound a lot better when they come out of their own speaker, and those little fills he does just hit you at various angles, making the music fresh.  These DVDs will make you know that you were justified in upgrading to a digital sound system with speakers all over the room.<br /><br />This Knopfler album has been improved over the \\"Brothers In Arms\\" release in a couple of ways.  First, the B.I.A. album came as a single disc with both the stereo CD and the 5.1 DVD on opposite sides of that disc.  This makes the disc vulnerable if you are inclined to lay it down since there is no \\"safe\\" painted side.  The marking on those discs are very small, right along the hole, making me grab my reading glasses just to load the right side.  The \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" set has corrected this flaw by issuing two discs, the standard stereo CD and a completely separate DVD, both with painted non-playing sides.  So now you have a disc for your CD players, such as in the car and the DVD for your 5.1 surround sound system, which makes this a better deal over the previous set.  Additionally, there is more on the DVD than just the audio tracks.  There is a Knopfler semi-bio where he talks about his beginnings in Scotland and his evolution through his musical roots, including some guitar talk.  While not really a performance type of presentation, he does do some noodling on a guitar to make points about some of the music.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that even though I have had the original CD from the day it came out, I bought this new version and not only feel it was worth it, but hope that Knopfler has plans to process all of his work into these 5.1 DVDs.  I will gladly pay to replicate every one of my Dire Straits / Knopfler CDs if he does.talk.

B00005AWMF|4.0|HAD HEARD HER MUSIC ON RADIO AND JUST HAD TO HAVE HER CD.  IT DID NOT LET ME DOWN.  IT MOVES THE BODY, MIND AND SOUL.  LOVED IT.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|I was 18 when this album came out and since that high school to college transition  is the  time when music is a big part of your life, it was great hearing this again.  Going through the usual \\"upgrades\\" in media over the years, say 8-track, to album, to maybe cassette and ultimately to CD made it expensive to keep buying the same music over and over.  This means that a lot of people will be playing \\"greatest hits\\" CDs, since it is reckoned to be the most economic way to go for many.  The problem is that some great music will never be played on the radio, and therefore never be included on a compilation.  So when I hit play on this new disc set, it was refreshing that 30-year-old music can sound so \\"new\\".  There are some fine songs on this album that you just never hear on \\"classic rock\\" radio.<br /><br />On the technical side, incase it was not so clear (it wasn't to me), this set has two discs.  The first is a standard stereo CD of the album with 3 additional tracks.  The second disc is a DVD which has the same album (minus the three extra tracks) in 5.1 audio.  I was worried that I needed a SACD player to hear the 5.1 rendering, but no, just a digitally interfaced DVD player and receiver.  Besides the audio-only album, the DVD has a very interesting interview with Miller talking about the album, and delving a bit into his youth (he got guitar lessons from Les Paul and T-Bone Walker in his house as a pre-teen!) and how he evolved as a musician.  There is a concert performance from 2005 rendered in 5.1 that can be considered a \\"best of\\" of Miller's work.  For blues aficionados, he does a set of some blues standards that show off a part of Miller many might not be aware of... great stuff for guitar fans.  The concert was never meant to be a DVD product (as stated in the included booklet insert), but was simply recorded from the screens at a concert by the audio techs.

B00005JOUM|5.0|nicely done! very intereting thriller. of course, the scenario and the plot are still with lot of holes if you want to be picky. but as long as you could watch it and don't have the urge to stand up and leave, it means that this is a very good movie, so good that could hold you tight on your seat. i enjoy it very much. i don't want to write a spoiler review.
B00005JOQS|2.0|Although many years ago, Chris Reeves in Superman #1 was still the best of all--Superman Returns has some good computer effects, but the final part with the crystals growing out in the ocean was too boring and too far out....like \\"Oh, come on!\\" <br />For some Superman fun...go out and rent the original movie on a DVD!
B00009L1UP|5.0|Queensryche USED to be the best band in the world, and I sadly have to say that this is their last record that is entirly awesome with no flaw. Dont get me wrong Promised Land is alright. But Empire is a record you just cant get enough of and the highlights are Best I Can, Jet City Women, and Empire, but of course there are many more on this album. This is a must have for you Queensryche fans [who have a really good taste in music]. This is just a MUST HAVE!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|To all music lovers.this a must have DVD.perfection at all levels.Push the buy button and don't hesitate one second.
B000053GTK|5.0|For fans of the band this album represeted a change in the Giant sound.The production is clinical the sound quite spikey which perfectly complements the six tracks. There is less sax and ensemble string arrangements and gary greens guitar comes more to the fore. The songs are vintage GG with great arrangements. A record of great invention still sounds like it was made yesterday.
0525948023|1.0|I am surprised to see so many positive reviews of Tolles latest book considering the criticism in recent studies. Paula Marvellys new bestseller Teachers of one, for example showed the inadeqacy of Tolles doctrine based on non duality and this a a very indepth study. Recent   customer reviews of his old book Power of Now also expose the problems with Tolles work. AS a self help book then certainly it may be helpful for a short time but for those interested in going deeper and getting satisfying answers Tolles work falls very far short.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|There is so much that is impressive in director John Ford's masterful 1956 classic that it is easy to get preoccupied with its glaring flaws. However, it's most important to recognize this film as a cinematic elegy of the old-fashioned western, a last-stand monument to Ford's unique oeuvre in movies before the revisionist filmmakers reshaped this type of film to meet contemporary tastes. Yet for its patently old-fashioned premise, the film contains unexpected darker tones which make the film fascinating. First, it depicts the unapologetic racism prevalent out in the frontier, and second, it has Ethan Edwards, a protagonist who not only shares these feelings but somehow redeems himself through his fortitude and often violent acts of self-defense. Through a vivid use of darkened doorways as a framing device, Ford and star John Wayne dexterously manage to elicit sympathy for the unsympathetic Edwards while maintaining his dying-breed status as a renegade outsider.<br /><br />Set in Texas a few years after the Civil War, the story focuses on Edwards' five-year long search for what remains of his family after a massacre by a band of Comanches headed by a chief named Scar. It becomes clear that youngest daughter Debbie may be alive, so Edwards and young tag-along, Martin Pawley, set off to find her. The motivations of the two couldn't be more different - Edwards was in love with Debbie's now-dead mother and seeks vengeance, which includes killing Debbie for being a converted Comanche; while Pawley wants to save Debbie and bring her back home. Frank S. Nugent's screenplay masterfully peels the layers off their journey with a series of revelations that lead to the dramatic final act. This is likely Wayne's finest two hours on film not because he plays his archetypal cowboy hero but because he shows a surprising audacity in exposing the dark soul of his character while slowly recognizing a begrudging humanism through his discoveries in the film.<br /><br />Everybody else is merely serviceable in comparison, including Jeffrey Hunter, who darts unsteadily between youthful arrogance and childish petulance as Pawley; Ward Bond as a bellowing reverend and Texas ranger; and a teenaged Natalie Wood, who has scant screen time late in the film as the grown Debbie. Vera Miles fares somewhat better as the headstrong Laurie, the girl Pawley leaves behind, though I find their romantic subplot rather distracting, especially toward the end with a lighthearted but lengthy wedding sequence. In fact, comic relief is used a little too liberally throughout the film with irritating performances from Hank Worden as the mentally defective Mose Harper and Ken Curtis as Laurie's anxious suitor Charlie. However, these are minor blemishes in the scheme of things, especially in light of Winton C. Hoch's magnificent cinematography. Never has the camera captured the beauty and drama of Monument Valley with more emotional fervor, even if it is masquerading as Texas. Special mention should also be given to Max Steiner's powerful musical score.<br /><br />Above all else, the film reflects the pinnacle of both Ford's and Wayne's careers, a point not lost on the elaborate two-disc 2006 DVD set. The first disc has a pristine print of the film along with a brief introduction by Wayne's son Patrick (who plays a small role in the film as a baby-faced Union soldier) and a terrifically insightful commentary track by director Peter Bogdanovich. He is not the only master director who reveres the film, as Curtis Hanson, Martin Scorsese, and John Milius offer their own praise on a new half-hour documentary on the second disc, \\"The Searchers: A New Appreciation\\". There are two other excellent featurettes included -  a 1998 behind-the-scenes documentary, \\"A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers,\\" and a vintage piece hosted by Gig Young called \\"Behind the Cameras\\", which has interviews with Hunter and Wood and an overview of Monument Valley. Don't expect a politically correct film, but it is difficult not to be mesmerized by the work of such masters.t a politically correct film, but it is difficult not to be mesmerized by the work of such masters.
6303027016|5.0|An excellent film, Good Morning Vietnam, brings to the screen the story of a US airman that gets transferred from Crete in Greece to Saigon in South Vietnam as the war in S.E. Asia is escalating. <br />It is 1965 and the USA is sending more and more troops to S. Vietnam in an effort to live up to its commitments and treaty obligations (SEATO), and turn the tide against communism.  The US Army, worried about the G.I.s' morale, flies in Airman Cronauer from Europe to be a radio deejay and entertain the troops.  Things get a bit more complicated when he begins going around the censors by playing Rock and Roll and giving the news as it is...       <br />The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both. <br />Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  The film does a great job of describing war-ravaged Vietnam as well as people's (including soldiers') every day lives and the problems they face under such conditions.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the MUSIC are all wonderful! <br />In short, Good Morning Vietnam is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />Recommended along with The Quiet American, starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser. <br />
0099450259|5.0|I am amazed at what such a short book could accomplish.  There is not one ouce of begging or cheap persuasion.  The simplicity and truth with which is is written is astounding .  And what it reveals is both palpable and profound.  The human strengths are admirable and the weaknesses, if not forgivable; understandable. <br />I was wholey moved.
B000002KJM|5.0|The five stars are for the music alone, NOT the sound quality of the CD. I consider this to be a raw, down and dirty blues-rock masterpiece, and I enjoy EVERY TRACK. There is not one weak song on this release IMHO. The heavily doctored sound quality of the CD was a major disappointment, although I kept the pressing anyhow, I figured at least until a properly remastered version comes out (BTW I snapped up the new 'Tres Hombres' remaster recently - the sound quality is great!). Fortunately, since I also happen to own a vinyl pressing of ZZ Top's First Album on the LONDON label, rather than wait for this to be properly released on CD, I went ahead and professionally digitized the vinyl through a DAT machine, cleaned up the crackle a bit, recorded it onto a blank disc, and stuck it in the jewel box of the original CD! The more I listen to this album now in it's original form,  the more it blows me away. In any case, I highly recommend this release for the music alone. Those who screwed up the sound for the original CD issue (including the band themselves) should be ashamed of themselves!. As the saying goes, 'if it ain't broke - don't fix it!'
B000FBGBPC|4.0|For a second album, these guys didn't go out and write one good track surrounded by the musical equivalent of rat turds!  These Canucks got it right!  They didn't change their formula too much from the last disc, and that's ok, at least they didn't try to expand their horizons and ruin everything like so many bands do while second guessing themselves on the sophomore record.  This album has less standout tracks and more consistency instead.  The first album started to have a slight fizzle while the 2nd remains strong throughout.  I would definitely buy this album again.  This is one of the few good rock albums coming out amongst all the bling-blings, what-what's, and one hit wonders that will last as long as a camera flash and be just as memorable.
B00005TT77|4.0|I have to admit I have never seen the 2001 movie from which this soundtrack is based, nor do I know the significance of the Beatles music to the characters. However, once I heard Rufus Wainwright's acoustic cover of \\"Across the Universe\\", a touching performance that puts his yearning, mournful voice to good use, I was curious what other surprises could be in store on this disc. I later found out the reason these musicians were recruited for the recording was a matter of economics. Producer Andy Gershon wanted to use the original Beatles recordings, but apparently, Michael Jackson, who owned the rights to the Lennon-McCartney catalogue, was charging $300K for each song they recorded. As it turns out, the resulting disc is pretty solid, offering a great variety of reinterpretations of familiar songs - some quite wonderful, others less so but none too painfully.<br /><br />Husband-and-wife folk rockers Aimee Mann and Michael Penn kick things off with a pleasing version of the optimistic \\"Two of Us\\". Pleasing also describes Sarah McLachlan's take on \\"Blackbird\\", which is greatly aided by Sean Ashby's delicate strumming. The pace picks up with the Wallflowers' jaunty \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" complete with Rami Jaffee's Austin Powers-sounding keyboards and Jackson Browne providing harmony vocals. Eddie Vedder's uniquely scratchy vocal delivery is well served by \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" where he accompanies himself ably on guitar and harmonica. Ben Harper gets into an appropriately psychedelic mood for \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" with particularly lush strings and fulsome horns, though he gets carried away with the bombastic ending.<br /><br />Things start to fluctuate at this point in the disc. Sheryl Crow sounds somnambulant and rather constricted on a country-twanged \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", a sub-par choice for her slick performing style; and the plaintive Ben Folds barely registers on the too-brief \\"Golden Slumbers\\". In the one track that sounds like a Fab Four impersonation (or more accurately, a Beatlemania facsimile), the Vines cover \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" in a comparatively generic manner. The Stereophonics make \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" sound like a mid-1970's Rod Stewart pop-rocker, while the Black Crowes put their familiar blues-oriented stamp on the most psychedelic of Beatles songs, \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\".<br /><br />Chocolate Genius, led by Marc Anthony Thompson, refashions John Lennon's touching paean to his mother, \\"Julia\\", into a hazy dirge that actually brings a surprising resonance to the song. However, sounding a bit too much like MacLachlan, singer-songwriter Heather Nova lends little distinction to her version of \\"We Can Work It Out\\", granted one of the most lightweight songs in the Lennon-McCartney canon. Howie Day effectively slows down \\"Help!\\" into an atmospheric, almost halting plea of quiet desperation. Dylan sound-alike Paul Westerberg croaks through \\"Nowhere Man\\" with little flair; and in perhaps the biggest departure from the original, the now-defunct indie band Grandaddy turns \\"Revolution\\" into a chugging slow-poke rocker. On the final track, Aussie musician Nick Cave lends his recognizably barren style to a somewhat desultory \\"Let It Be\\". It's a mixed bag for sure, but what really comes across is the unbeatable craftsmanship and magical yin-and-yang perfection of Lennon and McCartney.n (or more accurately, a Beatlemania facsimile), the Vines cover \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" in a comparatively generic manner.

B00005JNRY|4.0|I liked CARS I really did like it but it lacks the magic of TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed.  I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels.  The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the \\"mother road\\" in the minds of  younger generations.  Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about  cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents.  The characterizations of vehicles living in \\"Radiator Springs\\" were clever but came from central casting.  The most original element of \\"Cars\\" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about.  In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the \\"planes\\" leave car tracks in the sky.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is the album that inspired me to be a jazz musician. When I was in high school, deciding what I wanted to do with my life, debating whether to pursue a career in music or not, it was this album which made me sure that music would be something that I would stick with. The moment I heard it, I couldn't stop listening to it. The sounds are hypnotic and draw me into them every time I listen to the album again.    Everything about this album is perfect. I don't think there is a jazz ensemble that can play as tightly together as the sextet on this album. The solos are exciting, driving, interesting and innovative. There are little things that the rhythm section and the horns do as backgrounds behind the soloist. The arrangements on here are great for a jazz sextet, and really gives the group a great big sound.     This album was the culmination of Coltrane's career as a saxophonist. Each musician on here is the best at what they do. This is the album which defines what post-bop really is. If you are a jazz musician, this is the standard that you should try to attain. I don't think there will ever be a saxophonist as influential as John Coltrane.
B0001KU93C|2.0|The first 30 minutes of the movie were of interest. The Americans with red hoods etc. Even with makeup Franco Nero looks a little young for the role.  The movie has a great deal of plot holes and jumps some.  The dub job was the worst I've seen in an Italian Western. I watched the movie in Italian with the subtitles, it was much more enjoyable. A good see once film but nothing to call great.  I did think the ear cutting was original. The extra disc on DVD, \\"The Last Pistolero\\" was a slick little short.
0440180295|5.0|At least for me! After I read Slaugherhouse-Five, my Kurt Vonnegut obsession had officially begun.  <br /> <br />I still think Cat's cradle is my favorite Vonnegut book, however I think the Billy Pillgram character is one of Vonnegut's best explorations of the struggle within the human heart. I think BP is a fantastic study of a man conflicted by his place in public society cast againt his experiences in the military.
B00005JO9J|5.0|at first i was reluctant to purchase this dvd because i've only seen a few episodes. but it turns out to be a great buy. i like sandra oh for her role in \\"under the tuscan sun\\" but Chandra Wilson really caught my attention. she's a super bitch but cool at the same time.
B000FIH4RO|5.0|This is a great cd, and in my opinion, their best!!  I am a big fan of the \\"hair\\" era.  The songs on this cd are longer at the end than they were on the original cd and cassette, which is a good surprise!  The track listing on this re-release is out of sorts, seeing that the songs are listed in the correct order but they don't fall the same way on the actual cd when you play it.  The extra track is just icing on this one.
B000031WD9|4.0|For a teen comedy flick with potty humour and \\"showcase\\" nudity, American Pie does really well with some coming of age themes. Four boys are on a quest to lose their virginity by prom night, and go to various lengths to impress the girls they meet. Life lessons are learned and the boys grow up in ways other than sexually. The four boys led by Jason Biggs are all likeable, and Seann William Scott had a breakout role as the party-loving fifth wheel to the group. Eugene Levy, one of great comedic alumnis from the 80s, has hilarious moments as Jim's dad. And for who can forget the Shannon Elizabeth scene and the bit with the movie's namesake?<br /><br />Not a lot on the dvd, but there's a fun commentary with the staff and actors, though it's a bit crowded at times. American Pie's not a groundbreaking film, but it's a solid one for its genre, and may be one of the few really worth owning.
038533348X|5.0|Of all Vonnegut books, I'd have to say Cat's Cradle is his greatest achievement (despite a few short pieces of his that are brilliant). So, if there are any Vonnegut \\"newbies\\" out there looking for the right Vonnegut book to start with, order away! You will not be disappointed.
0671027344|3.0|This is a very popular book. To see for yourself how popular it is you only need to know that it's backed by MTV (yes, the MTV generation is reading books now!), which ran several TV commercials for it. Surprisingly enough, it seems they picked a winner in supporting this novel.<br /><br />The novel is written in a letter format. We're never told who the letters (or diary entries) are being written for, but I guess that's part of the appeal of the book; there's not alot of backstory to speak of.<br /><br />Charlie is entering highschool. He seems to be scared, but he has his letters to use as an outlet for his inquiries and shyness. Charlie eventually meets up with \\"Nothing\\"--a boy who wishes to be called nothing if not for his name. His real name is Patrick, and his step-sister Sam become two of Charlie's very few friends. They introduce him to pop culture; we see that he sort of nosedives into it, because he's been a bit emotionally immature before now. The letter entries jump back and forth from discussing his friends, to discussing his introversion and lack of social skills. Eventually, Sam becomes a love interest, and she becomes the main focus of the novel for quite a few chapters.<br /><br />I understand that ninth grade is an uncomfortable time in a boys life (I was there just 6 or 7 years ago myself), but many of the passages in this novel are not convincing; they present themselves as mockeries of what an actual adolescent would say, as written by an adult, rather than the genuine feeling one could express at that age. However, some of the chapters are really enjoyable and occasionally funny. I found myself more than once being reminded of my own adolescence--and this is, I feel, the main reason this book has such appeal. Like music, this book provides a solid amount of escapism for an early adolescent; it's not condescending or cruel, like we sometimes perceive the world to be. It's anecdotes can be comforting at times, while the ending of the book isn't so much of a comfort (though I also didn't think it a shock, as the other probably intended it to be).<br /><br />The Wikipedia entry for this book states that nearly 1200 reviews have been written for this book. I'm not sure mine will be read by many, but I would like to say that while I think this book is over rated, I would not go as far to say that it is \\"miserable emo rubbish\\" (see Wiki entry). I give it more credit than that, and being such a short read, I'd recommend it to just about any adolescent interested in it, as I know how helpful escapism can be in that stage in life.<br /><br />There are numerous parallels' to J.D.

B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit is an easy band to hate. Their lead singer is a guy so obsessed with himself it's sickening, and, well, I suppose the rest of the band isn't that bad actually, aside from DJ Lethal of course. However, if you can put your feelings toward Fred, and my feelings toward Lethal, to the side, then Significant Other has many standout tracks that are still fun to listen to today, if only for nastalgia.<br /><br />For whatever reason, Fred Durst seems to think he's some master MC who should rap in most every song, but the simple fact is, he's better in songs like Re-arranged and Nobody Like You. Of course Jon Davis is a big part of why the latter is such a great song. \\"So why don't you like DJ Lethal?\\" Well, just listen to the first track, aptly titled Intro, and you'll quickly learn why (that insanely annoying voice). Like I said though, the rest of the band, led by a great showman in Wes Borland, is up to par with every other nu metal band that was flooding the airwaves back in '99, if maybe not for a couple better riffs.<br /><br />If you like Fred's rapping then Just Like This, I'm Broke, and 9 Teen 90 Nine are probably your salvation. I can deal with the barely passable rapping, but I enjoy his singing and yelling more. So for me, songs like Re-arranged, Nobody Like You, and No Sex are some of the better tracks. Limp Bizkit isn't a lyricly deep band in the least, so if you're going in hoping to find some lyrics that you can relate to, don't be surprised if you don't. Unless you're an angst-ridden 13 year old who hates his/her parents, these lyrics need not apply to you. However, they're presented in an undeniably catchy way.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Just Like This, Re-arranged, Nobody Like You, I'm Broke, and Don't Go Off Wandering. By no means is this a CD any random person could pick up and like because quite frankly, Limp Bizkit is an acquired taste. If cockiness is an unforgiveable sin for you, don't give this CD a second thought because Fred is probably one of the cockiest guys in music today. But if you're like me and just like flashing back to when things seemed so much easier, this is probably an album you should listen to.d is probably one of the cockiest guys in music today.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|I loved Muse's Absolution and was eagerly awaiting their newest offering.  After listening to Black Holes and Revelations for a couple of weeks now, I can honestly say that I actually like their newest release even better than Absolution.  It's a different style and sound - this seems more soaring, beautiful, and epic (some unenlightened critics might say overblown).  I went to see them in concert a couple nights ago and they were incredible live.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are Map of the Problematique, City of Delusion, Starlight, Take a Bow, Assassin, and Knights of Cydonia, although there wasn't any track that I didn't like (Soldier's Poem felt like it belonged on Absolution instead of this release, but I still enjoyed it).
0140177396|4.0|This book is a very brief but moving tale that will leave you thinking. Stienbeck's mastery here is in character development. He creates a cornicopia of characters in a genius way, quick and to the point. Somehow, in such a short amount of time, he creates characters you feel you've known your whole life.<br /><br />The scenery is well built as well, and the story itself is interesting and timeless. It could be set in 2006 just as easily, and still be relevant. It's a very relaxing read, and flows smoothly.<br /><br />You wont want to put this book down, and you'll only be busy about an hour reading it. This book is just as entertaining as I'm sure it was in 1937, and can be called a classic.
0807014265|5.0|This book is divided into two parts. The first part is a moving description of Frankl's time in Nazi concentration, work and death camps. Related in simple language, this stark depiction of the evil of which man is capable and the strength of the human mind and spirit should be required reading in every school in America.  The second part of the book describes the psychological theories that Frankl developed as a result of his experience. The language is more academic, as is the subject matter, but, it remains interesting and instructive to the end. This book demands to be read in a single sitting and to be considered throughout one's life.
B0000CAXIC|4.0|THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE is an example of how a record brings a rock band into the public spotlight, but is not cosidered to be a breakthrough. This album is a great piece of work, because it displays progression of Foo Fighters' sound before they hit it big. Tracks from this album brought the band millions of listners, but the actual record was not thought to be good enough to promote internationally. Those tracks however, would later lead Foo Fighters to their fame. With Grohl originally from Nirvana, this band would would definately have an awesome sense of time, rhythm, and sound. And they do; Foo Fighters perform well together, keep a steady pulse, and use dynamics to their perfection. This record is mostly a light rock sound, but there are times where there is a good head banger quality present. This album is also some of Foo Fighters best work and rightfully so. Once heard, there's no denying it. With rock classics thrown deep within this record, THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE is a most have for any rock fan.    Stand out tracks include:  \\"Hey Johnny Park!\\"  \\"Wind Up\\"  \\"My Hero\\"  \\"Everlong\\"  \\"New Way Home\\"

B0002W18MU|5.0|Umm...  To lay down and listen to this album for the first time, without distraction, kids in bed...  Part of what has made Johnny Cash's relationship with Rick Rubin so amazing is the transformation of other artist's work, popular or obscure.  I have every piece of this collaboration so I knew what to expect.  Depth, emotion and that voice.  I have said for years that if Johnny Cash read the phone book on record, I would buy it.  His is the voice of sorrow, suffering, life and redemption.  I thought the Unearthed collection pulled this all together so well.  And now there is American V. <br /> <br />This is not an album of music. It is a study of an incredible life lived of mistakes made, of remorse and triumph.  Johnny's voice is so out front in the mix, frail, quivering, yet reaching for once last gasp of proof.  Johnny Cash had to sing, no matter the circumstances.  There is a feeling of private inclusion that is almost creepy, yet incredibly moving (trite, but words cannot describe it).   <br /> <br />Through all of the American recordings, I felt a sense of closeness that grew with each release, through deft song selection and Johnny's take on each song.  This album brought me to the end of his life.  Right there, almost too close. <br /> <br />This is not a CD for a summer cruise with the top down, or for cranking while out on the deck having a beer and grilling up supper.  In fact, I have not figured out where this will fit into my life, yet more so than any album, book or movie I can remember, this CD WILL fit in some place as a document and companion for some unforeseen occurance.  Dedicate the time and space for your first listening, and be prepared to be shaken up a bit when it is over.
B00000G6TL|5.0|Contains almost all standard Deep Purple listening, but for some reason, \\"Space Trucking\\" is missing! I understand including \\"You Keep on Moving\\" to represent Mk 4, but seriously, which would you rather have? Nothing against Bolin though. I'm disappointed that no best of compilation has included \\"Mistreated,\\" which is often overlooked. Everything else is good. A good way to get started on Deep Purple, along with Made in Japan, Machine Head, and Burn.
B000002A3T|5.0|Arrived in a timely fashion in excellent condition. I would buy from this vendor again without hesitation.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|i wasted 3 hrs watching this horrible movie this movie sucks
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Burn is often overlooked because there's no Gillan. Don't be one of the people who ignore this album. Everything is good. The first track rocks from start to finish, and the band never lets up. Even my (comparatively) least favorite track, \\"Lay Down, Stay Down,\\" is pretty good. \\"Sail Away\\" is the next best song to \\"Burn,\\" but doesn't recieve much recognition for some odd reason. If you've heard recordings of \\"Mistreated\\" live, i.e., California Jam or Made in Europe, you might be a bit disappointed in the studio version, but it's still excellent. All in all a masterpiece. Highly recommended.
B00005JOQS|5.0|bryan singer was just trying to be part of the superman tradition.he did the whole right,and it was about time for a new superman. no doubt christopher reeve will be missed but come on you cant give the film a bad rating without him do you really think he could have played superman again at the age he was with or without the accident .brandon routh played superman just as good maybe better. i just hope theres more sequels instead of just talking about it.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I rarelly listen to rock music, so i liked this \\"mainstream\\" album. Most people will like its catchy choruses and great sound. It's an \\"easier\\" album, considering the band's previous releases, but the genuine and hardcore fans will certainly be dissapointed with this \\"cosmetic\\" album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I just got into Radiohead about a year ago and they are already my favorite band. Mainly because of this CD. This coming from a fan of thrash/tech metal and electronic music. I just cant get over how emotional and stunning this album is. Every song is a masterpiece on its own. I almost consider myself an idiot for not appreciating this album sooner.  I love the theme and direction of the CD. It may take a few listens to really understand this album, but once you get it, you'll GET IT. This CD deserves 6 stars.
B000000WJ2|5.0|I agree with Tom Hamburger of England that this is an overlooked masterpiece and it's not just because I'm getting hungry and could use a Whopper.  \\"Talk Is Cheap\\" doesn't come anywhere near the quality of this music.  In fact, it reflects the problems The Stones ran into when the well ran dry, fumbling around with Muddy Waters riffs and other uninspired ideas.  Richards' \\"Live at the Palladium\\" has a little more kick to some of the songs, but still nowhere near the power of \\"Main Offender.\\"    There is just enough sleaze on \\"Main Offender\\" to offset its purer passions and religion.  \\"Demon\\" is a hymn in the old Protestant tradition if there ever was one.  And, whether it's G-chords or G-strings he's pulling off, Richards has soul rights and let's not complain.  If hard-driving funk is a word, then enter it into the dictionary under Richards, Keith.  Simplicity could be a problem, but it isn't because he's very focused here and less is so much more.  Besides, the guy's obviously cracked and he might do something to you if you give him less than 5 stars.    Keith Richards IS NOT the Stones, though, not anymore than John Lennon WAS the Beatles.  With the Stones, it seems like Richards provided more of the general sound and Mick Jagger provided the very necessary vocals, lyrics and compositions that made that sound extraordinary. And like Ringo, Charlie Watts HAD to be the drummer. Richards comes close on \\"Main Offender\\" but... no cigar -- he still would need a younger, hungrier Jagger to hit the old highs.  But that not being possible, he's better off without the older, depleted Jagger muddying the waters.  (Sorry.)    999 is also 1 less than 1000, so let's just add one and forget about the heroin factor.  You don't need to be stoned to thoroughly enjoy this music.
006072448X|5.0|In contrast with city schools in high-crime areas where violence in the form of bullying, perhaps the occasional fist fight or even stabbing can be prevalent, school massacres perpetrated by students most often occur in middle class suburbs, receiving mass media attention due to the irregularity of their occurence. The whys and wherefores of these acts have been examined extensively, a natural compulsion of humanity to seek someone or something to blame, the idea of innate evil too much to bear. <br />Shriver's astute novel addresses the question of why a well-off teenager from a good family such as Kevin would commit such an act in a sensitive and compelling way that gives a real philosophical insight into the human psychee. <br />Written effectively as an engaging series of letters from Eva Khatchadourian to her estranged husband Franklin, the story is told of how her 15 year old son Kevin came to murder in cold blood seven of his fellow classmates and two of the school staff. A perceptive to the point of frightening account is given of the effects of such a vile act on the mother herself, the family, and wider repercussions on the community. <br />Eva is often self-deprecating, her introspection displaying an individual eaten up by inner turmoil, guilt and anxiety she gives the archetypal reaction of `Was I a bad mother, was it my fault?', always eager to draw attention to her own faults, as this is what she has come to expect from other people. <br />Eva sees a malicious, malevolent Kevin, trying to love him, yet not being able to find anything to love when the only tenderness he ever shows is a ruse designed to fool his father and infuriate his mother. The fact that Kevin hides his true self from his father, perhaps the one redeeming feature for Eva, the one positive that she gleans from the entire situation: She knows her son's genuine personality, because he chooses to show it to her. <br />A fantastically gripping novel, I highly recommend this book. The story calling on the reader to experience emotions as diverse as disgust, hatred and compassion, even on occasion toward Kevin, truly is an emotional and rewarding read. <br />
B000002MUW|3.0|I HAVE THIS ALBUM AND LIKE EROTICA ALBUM, MOST OF THE SONGS IN THIS ALBUM ARE BORING, AND BEDTIME STORY IS AN ODD MOOD-LESS SONG WIT SOFT BEATS AND MUCH WEIRDER VIDEO,CAUSE IN THAT VIDEO MADONNA IS USED FOR AN EXPERIMENT IN MACHINE THAT ENTER HER DREAM,SO ALL THE VIDEO SHE SLEEPS AND WE SEE HER DREAM UNTILL THE DREAM BECOME A TURMOIL AND THE VIDEO ENDS WHEN SHE WAKES UP AND THE EXPERIMENT IS OVER.THE VIDEO IS VERY FUTURISTIC AND WELL PRODUCED WITH MANY EFFECTS-WHEN U HEAR THE SONG AND ITS WORDS U FEEL LIKE U ENTER A TWILIGHT ZONE WHERE U DONT FEEL SAD NOR HAPPY OR ANY EMOTION-JUST LIKE IN A DREAM,ITS A KNOWN FACT THAT WHEN WE DREAM OUR FRONT SIDE OF BRAIN,THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOGIC AND THINKING DOESNT WORK,AND THE BACK SIDE OF BRAIN ,THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR EMOTIONS WORK-THIS IS WHY DREAMS HAVE NO LOGIC IN THEM-AND THIS SONG IS PRACTICALLY ABOUT GETTING IN A DREAM WHERE,ACCORDING TO THE SONG LYRICS, U LEAVE LOGIC AND REASON.SO I LOVE THIS SONG JUST FROM FACT IT HAS NO EMOTIONS IN IT OR MOODS AND WHEN U HEAR IT U JUST DONT FEEL NOTHING-IT CLEANS MY HEAD FROM THOUGHTS AND MAKE ME ENTER TO EMPTY SPACE . BUT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ALBUM IS THE SONG SECRET-THIS SONG WAS THE BACKGROUND SONG THAT RULED THE YEAR 1994 EVEN IF IT DIDNT TOPPED THE CHARTS MAYBE IT TOPPED THE CHARTS IN ISRAEL CAUSE IT WAS PLAYED ALOT HERE. AND EVEN IF I WASNT A MADONNA FAN AT THAT YEAR CAUSE I WAS ONLY 11 OLD AND MUSIC WASNT IN MY EVERYDAY AGENDA-I HEARD THIS SONG OVER AND OVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS YEAR UNTILL IT REMIND ME THE CITY TEL AVIV CAUSE I HEARD THIS SONG EVERYTIME I CAME THERE-AND THE  MUSIC VIDEO STYLE REMIND ME THAT CITY TOO.ALTHOUGH THIS SONG ISNT THE BEST OF MADONNA'S MUSIC IT IS THE MOST MEMORABLE 90'S SONG FOR ME AND IT WAS THE BACKGROUND OF 1994-LIKE MATERIAL GIRL WAS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC OF 1985 WHEN I WAS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD. THIS SONG REALLY SYMBOLIZE THE TRENDY SLOW MUSIC BARS IN TEL AVIV AND USA.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|As a life long Pink Floyd fan I took a female friend to see this tour in 1994, a woman who had never seen them live. The next day she told me that with the exception of giving birth to her daughter it was the most moving experience of her life. <br /> <br />Another friend described it as \\"like going to church on another planet.\\" <br /> <br />For me it was the single most extraordinary aural and visual experience of my life, and deeply moving. From the number of people around me at the concert who during \\"Comfortably Numb\\" were literally weeping, hundreds of thousands of others have reacted in a similiar way. <br /> <br />Having seen the show live four times I cannot imagine how this DVD set could possibly have been presented more perfectly. Beyond the obvious limitations of reducing this monumental production to the small screen, it's all here. <br /> <br />If Pink Floyd are more than a rock band to you, if they're a part of your DNA, then you'll be blissfully satisfied and exhilarated three hours after you hit the play button. <br /> <br />For those that weren't fortunate enough to get to that point, especially younger viewers, you'll get it. You'll understand. <br /> <br />For those who are into lighting and sound and stagecraft, you'll see 12 year old technology that hasn't been touched by any other act. No one has come close. Short of Pink Floyd setting off a nuclear weapon over a stadium it's hard to imagine how the enormity of this creation could be topped. <br /> <br />For those who are guitar freaks, David Gilmour's work on this DVD is worthy of his face being on Mt. Rushmore. <br /> <br />A deeply beautiful and heart wrenching thing to watch. Words fail. Simply jaw dropping.
B00005J6T0|5.0|THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ALBUM MUST BE LA ISLA BONITA-THE FIRST LATIN SONG THAT BURSTED IN THE MID 80'S AND CREATED THE BASE FOR LATIN POP MUSIC MANIA THAT BURSTED LATER IN 1999-JENNIFER LOPEZ,RICKY MARTIN,ENRIQUE IGLESIAS ETC. THEIR LATIN POP MUSIC BASED ON LA ISLA BONITA-THE LATIN MUSIC ROOT AND ONE OF THE MEMORABLE SONG OF THE 80'S. THIS SONG ALSO WAS THE BACKGROUND THEME OF THE YEARS 1986-1987.....REALLY GREAT SONG AND GREAT ALBUM
0743454537|5.0|I could not put this book down and ended up reading most nights until 3:00 a.m. This story was about a family who had a baby specifically\\" genetically engineered\\" for the purpose of helping their other child who has cancer. From the first moment that Anna is born she gives her sister, Kate her cord blood. Through the years Anna gives her sister blood and bone marrow and anything else that will put her into remission. This leaves her older brother Jesse sort of left out so he starts doing criminal acts to give himself the acceptance and love he craves from his parents. The mother Julia is high strung and seems oblivoius to the pain both physical and mental that she is causing Anna. Of course she completly ignores Jesse. It is almost like he is invisible. The husband, who is a firefighter,  copes by fighting fires and being a support to Anna. The family is thrown for a loop when Anna decides she has had enough and sues her parents for medical emancipation. The emotions are raw and the family is almost torn a part. I loved the way the author describes the characters and gets deep into their feelings. It isw a must read for anyone.
B000002H33|5.0|WELL GUYS,HELLRAISER IS WRONG AS ALWAYS.MASTER OF PUPPETS DESPITE HIS RANTINGS IS THE BEST THRASH ALBUM ALONG WITH RIDE THE LIGHTNING.YOU SHOULD BUY BOTH ALBUMS TO EARN THE RESPECT OF YOUR PEERS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0316172324|1.0|I purchased the book because of all the hype and was not very impressed.  I suppose if you desire to overanalyze life you may enjoy it.  I came away from the book with very little and was quite disappointed.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|I really have to wonder what all these self-named \\" real pink floyd fans\\" are smoking.  I for one am fairly dissapointed by this DVD.  First of all, what is with the 2nd drummer???? Can Nick Mason no longer play the parts??? Second, the Division Bell and Momentary Lapse material just sucks and has nothing at all in common with classic era or vintage Pink Floyd.  Yes, there are highlights: Wish you were here, most of the dark side set and One of these day to name a few, but this is hardly something to get really excited about.  It lacks something and it would be easy to say it is Roger Waters.  No it is something more because I recently saw Gilmour on his On an Island tour and he did quite well without Mr. Waters present.  Not to mention Waters does quite well without Gilmour, but that is another story.  No I hate to admit it, but it just seems rather boring and uninspired.  It simply is not the band that I grew up watching and enjoying.  I think i'll stick to Live in Pompeii and In the Flesh......
0743201140|5.0|This was an excellent read with great suggestions for centering your life around your strengths rather than focusing on your weaknesses.  I dont entirely agree with the message, however I do know that the focusing on weaknessses will not take us very far in our pursuit of success.  Recommendded.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence was the last, and my least favourite, of the great Led Zeppelin albums, viz. I'm not including Outdoor (more like Outhouse!) or CODA. <br /> <br />Presence was always inaccessible to me for some intangible reason and I rarely played it.  I had read interviews with Page years later where he was bemused that no one liked Presence, as he personally liked it. <br /> <br />Following the recent 30th anniversary of the release of Presence, there were a number of music magazine articles I read saying the usual deal about what an under rated & over looked album Presence was. <br /> <br />Being a big fan of Led Zeppelin (especially Page's guitar playing & production) and given they aren't making any new Zeppelin albums, I decided I should \\"study\\" Presence more closely. <br /> <br />After revisting it and living with it for a few weeks I realised that a number of the filler tracks were quite good and Tea for One was a hidden gem of blues/rock guitar playing - a kind of latter day Since I've Been Loving You.  I also came to the conclusion that the tracks were badly sequenced on the album contributing to its inaccessibility. <br /> <br />My solution has been to notionally resequence Presence, as below, and I personally play the album in that order.  It's become a completely different (new!) album to me and I have unlocked the sequence of its success! <br /> <br />\\"Side One\\" <br />4.  Nobody's Fault But Mine <br />6.  Hots On For Nowhere <br />7.  Tea For One <br />3.  Royal Orleans <br /> <br />\\"Side Two\\" <br />2.  For Your Life <br />5.  Candy Store Rock <br />1.  Achilles Last Stand
B000BNNLN4|1.0|I have a real problem with not finishing a book that I have already started, particularly if I have gone to the trouble of buying it. But that wasn't the reason I endured it all the way to the final page. This book was one of those listed in the Economist's \\"Best books of the 2005\\" list, so I just read on, hoping in vain that at some point I would find something amusing about it. <br /> <br />Maybe I have a sense of humour failure but I just didn't see anything at all funny about the plot, the linguistically challenged dialogues, or the characters. One of the reviewers here has quite rightly asked the question: why the tractors. They've got nothing at all to do with the plot. None whatsoever. The tractor sections are nothing more than the ramblings of a deluded and senile man who happens to know a thing or two about mechanical engineering. The repetitive jokes about the blonde ukrainian woman's english get excruciatingly tiring after chapter 4 - and they were never that amusing to begin with.  <br /> <br />I have the utmost respect for anyone who can put pen to paper and publish a book but, I'm sorry, this was really atrocious. If you, like I was, are tempted to buy this because of the all the rave reviews you have read, I strongly advise you to this: satisfy your curiosity by getting it from the library instead...and return it after chapter 3.     <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|Like many others, I never watched Veronica Mars until reading these reviews and then renting the DVD set from the local library.  I have to admit it took me a good three episodes before I got hooked, then there was no tearing me away from my TV until i had completed the entire season in only 3 days time.  I have to say I am so upset I did not discover this show until going into it's thrid season.  After watching season 1 on DVD I then ordered myself a copy of amazon so that i would have it to watch over and over again until the copy I ordered of Season 2 comes out at the end of August.   <br /> <br />This show really is a buffy and nancy drew meets OC. It contains the highschool drama, romance, mystery, twists, and excitement. Veronica is very witty and intelligent making this show amazing! Aside from the season long mystery that veronica is always working on, each individual episode has a mini mystery that is solved by the end of the episode. On top of all that you are following the lives of veronica, her friends, boyfriend/ex-boyfriend through highschool, break-ups, suicide, and murder.   <br /> <br />BUY this DVD and Season 2 and watch them, you will not be disappointed, you will surely be hooked and anticiapting the next season. Season 3 starts October 3rd, TUesday at 9pm on channel 9. Be sure to tune in!
B000025XKM|5.0|This album is dear to my heart, and I never grow tired of it. My personal preference for Drake's music aside, I think this ranks as one of the greatest albums ever in the acoustic/folk/singer-songwriter genre. Though he doesn't do a lot of things that larger looming icons (such as Dylan, Joni Mitchell) can do in terms of variety of emotional landscape covered, within his own niche he was and is an utter master. He weaves a powerful spell on this album. Nowadays, his influence has continued to grow and you hear many younger performers emulating his style. He's usually not classified as a rock performer, but you can hear his influence spilling over into rock over the decades. Listening this album it is hard to understand why he never made it really big.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I must say, as a big Pearl Jam fan I was severly disapointed with the last two albums (Riot Act and Binaural). THey didn't have much worth listening to. However, the new Pearl Jam cd has been in my cd player continuously since I picked it up. I highly suggest getting your own copyu and listening a couple times as the group has finally put out another quality piece of work.

B0006213WG|5.0|When I first listened to Chuck I could hardly believe I was listening to Sum 41. Indeed Sum 41 has made a lot of changes to their sound... good changes! The most notable change would be of course that the music is faster, heavier, and... softer? Cool. Guitar solos, acoustic interludes and break downs are literally scatered all over this album. Without a doubt this album has some classical metal influences going for it. Another (obvious) change would definitely include the new direction they have taken lyricaly, they are serious and/or frustrated contrary to their trademark funny and satirical lyrics on previous albums.<br /><br />Although Chuck is \\"serious\\", it is still catchy and highly enjoyable. My favorite tracks include: I'm Not The One, Pieces, The Bitter End, Angels With Dirty Faces, and 88. I would simply reccomend this c.d. to anyone who like rock music in general. I would not reccomend this c.d. to anyone who negatively judges a bands music according to the merits of the genre they think they belong to. Chuck is a great effort and shows Sum 41 is not limited to any sort of \\"classification\\".
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a fascinating warning about our often misguided desire to achieve a perfect society, without crime, confrontations, or any kind of unpleasantness. Lowry takes that desire to the extreme by showing what we would have to surrender in order to reach that ideal (but unrealistic) goal. Unfortunately, that would include most of what makes us human- both the good and the bad. Although the ending has left some readers dissatisfied, I think Lowry's message would have been watered down had she tacked on some superficial, happy ending just to appease those who like their fiction sunny. As it stands, Lowry's warning is all the more convincing for showing how hard it is to change the status quo, particularly a status quo meticulously enforced and regulated. While this might seem on the surface to make the book inappropriate for younger readers, the opposite is true- they should read this book to understand the dangers of giving up too much of ourselves for some artificial culture that has the appearance of being civilized, but in fact is devoid of those very things that ultimately make us human and life worth living. I had read The Giver in tandem with An Audience for Einstein, another thoughtful book about memory and ethical choices.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|From the moment I heared that a new edition of resident evil was coming out it was said in many websites that it was going to be a Director's cut of the film. I'm sad to say I was suckered into getting this film. This is the same thing like the original the only difference is that it has an updated actors Filmography and an alternate ending that was just stupid to boot. And mabey one or three added menus that last mabey 2 to three mins. If you have the original don't waste your money in buying the deluxe edition.
0307276902|5.0|<br />Even with the all to heavy foul language I hung on everyword.  This was not a book I could skip pages in. <br /> <br />Addicts and those who know and love addicts will identify with much of it.  I imagine those who are not or know not - will be bored at best. <br /> <br />I find it to be an amazing illustration of \\"stream of conciousness\\" type thinking.  Are there addicts out there in the early stages of recovery who are really this brutally honest and aware of their thoughts, feelings and reactions?  <br /> <br />Additionally, what a shocker to everything 12 step and AA to witness the possibility of recovery and sobriety through sheer stubbornness and will power.  <br /> <br />Coming from an addict - who is to say what is true and what is not.  In the addict mind it is all subjective.  Relative to the moment or the drug of the moment.  High on drugs, food, resentment, anger, life?  What's flowing through the blood that motivates a person?   <br /> <br />Publishers argue over the book forever if you must - regardless this book isn't going away. I speculate you will find it on the bookshelves of therapists and rehabers and the like for a long time.  No it won't be recommended, no one will risk discouraging traditional means of recovery, but it will be there.  <br /> <br />RLS
B00005JOVN|3.0|characters are very superficially developed. you don't know who they are, what's buggin them, what makes them tick. so you can hardly make yourself care about any of them. computer generated images are obvious. all in all the movie is kinda..

B00004SVIK|5.0|I've listened through this album countless times and never tire of the beauty, the heart, and the genius behind Roger Water's masterpiece. The only thing better than the original album is this amazingly put together live album. It was cut togther from all of the performances at Earl's Court to create a basically perfect sound.  <br /> <br />Almost 25 minutes longer than the studio album, this show never feels constrained by the original album (not that it has any) and creates a much more atmospheric experience with Waters actually taking on the role of Pink in many songs. A great, great, album
B000E1KN8E|4.0|This japanese Reissue is very good, this CD until last 2 months, the price was $120.00 for the 1990 version, now, with remastered sound, a japanese version is $63.00.

0688170528|2.0|It only took reading one book before this one to figure out Picoult's writing style. I read My Sister's Keeper first and by the time I got half way through this novel I could tell how it was going to end. Picoult has some of the best ideas in the writing business, but the way she writes and develops these VERY sensitive and complex issues is appalling.  <br /> <br />The Pact was no exception. In order to keep us in suspense she skims over Emily's depression. Apparently Emily was sexually assaulted as a child, so what does she do? She leaves the bathroom she was molested in and goes on to eat her burger and live a perfectly normal and happy life. Very believable. Sexual assault is a serious, complex issue, and if you're going to mention it as part of character development you have to really get your hands dirty to make me believe that this character was tormented inside. Emily may not have shown signs of depression or suicide in real life, I'll give you that, but this is a novel so we need to see her depression in order to understand and like her character.   <br /> <br />I think Picoult is a very superficial writer who would rather entertain you than give you anything of substance. I found myself skipping over chunks of the book just to get to the end. I got bored of the obvious symbolism and how she likes to smack her readers over the head with things to make them obvious, which in turn renders them stereotypical. Drawing a skull and clouds when you're depressed? How cliché. Oh and how about drumming in the fact that the Gold's were Jewish by having them serve lox, bagels and cream cheese during the reception of Emily's funeral. Come on, let's be a tad more subtle.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|What originally can be thought of as \\"Summer Popcorn Fare\\" with large explosions, high action and a lead character whose anonymity is central to the film, surely could be an Oscar contender if positioned properly in its release.  Unfortunately, the marketing aspects of the film billed it to be an \\"action flick\\" competing with other comic book fare.<br /><br />With brilliant dialogue and amazing acting skills by Hugo Weaving (who can act 100 times better than 98% of those in the trade today, and you don't even get to see his face), the film moves along one thought provoking scene after another.  The concepts of freedom and control and what society sacrifices to acheive each are beautifully woven into a visual and auditory orgy of intense stimulation.  So much so that a viewer cannot help but be moved by the images, much less the thematic elements of the production.<br /><br />This isn't your simple bubble gum flick.  Combining some of the strongest themes of today, and possibly tomorrow, this movie strikes at the heart of what it means to be human and what it means to be free.  Don't be swayed by those who say there are comparisons to political persons in todays news... those people are reaching to draw similiarities.  The characters in V are not your typical black and white politicos, but rather in depth, troubled and complex beings who are exposing themselves to each other and the audience.<br /><br />Truly an excellent but underrated movie and something that will surprise you.

B00000DGUG|4.0|This amazing CD had the misfortune of being the follow up CD to Alanis Morissette's classic \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".  It is unfortunate because the two CD's sound nothing alike.   <br /> <br />SFIJ is one of those CD's that I consider to be ahead-of-it's-time.  The production by Glen Ballard is amazing and, imo, superior to the work he did on JLP.  The Eastern sounds - especially the guitars are hypnotic and work so well with Alanis's lyrics. <br /> <br />Hopefully SFIJ will be re-released and re-mastered one day (for it's 10th anniversary perhaps?) as it is the essential CD if you are an Alanis fan...start with JLP if you are a newcomer then come to this.  It's one of those few CDs that you can play in years to come and always discover something new. <br /> <br />Essential songs: <br /> <br />Baba <br />Are You Still Mad <br />Sympathetic Character <br />The Couch <br />Can't Not <br />I Was Hoping <br />One <br />Joining You

B000002MZ6|5.0|Before I even heard this album I never knew what to expect. But when I did I was absolutely astonished from what I heard. This is without a doubt the greatest piece of music I have ever heard. From start to finish, Mike Oldfield has created something so captivating, so pure and incredibly powerful and very emotional. When it came to the track, Let There Be Light, it created such a heart warmth emotional feeling that could bring tears to your very eyes. It brings your mind to an all new world where war and chaos no longer exist, bringing your imagination to their furthest limits, listening to the sounds not only for your ears, but music for your very heart and soul. 'Songs of Distant Earth'-One of the greatest experiences you'll ever hear.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I got this on Netflix, not really knowing anything about it (except the short little blurb NF provided).  This was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Superb plot, wonderfully imagined and put together, this film has it all:  tragedy, comedy, artistry, symbolism, humanity, obscure references, mystery, and a few violent scenes that made me shut my eyes...something I did NOT do in movies like \\"Saw\\" or Tarantino's \\"Hostel\\", which showcased \\"super-violence\\" in a comic book sort of way.  This was the real deal...freaking terrifying.<br /><br />Then, I got online and found out this film won the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes (2004), and is generally regarded as a masterpiece by fellow filmakers, including Tarantino (Cannes Jury Chairman that year).<br /><br />Strangely enough, I thought of him a couple times while watching the movie.  I thought he'd really like this film.  What do ya know...  =)
B00005MP58|5.0|Of all the Jane Austen movies, the 1996 miniseries \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is arguably the best and most detailed. While remaining faithful to the original comedy of manners, the story remains steadily-paced and exceptionally acted. It's sort of a thinking-girl's romance movie.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham! The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.<br /><br />It's obvious from the very first scenes -- when Lizzie jokingly comments that \\"a man of good fortune MUST be in want of a wife\\" -- that this is an adaptation that was done with love. The subplots, characters and atmosphere of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" are all here.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly, one piece at a time, but with several subplots that tie together as the story progresses. For a miniseries, it's actually rather spare and lacking in filler. And the dialogue -- based on Austen's -- is wonderfully well-written (\\"Beauty is not the only virtue. She has just inherited a fortune of ten thousand pounds, I understand.\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")<br /><br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds. Even the hairstyles are recreated. And the entire plot is steeped in the mores of 19th-century England, with the attitudes toward marriage, love, and propriety that bound everyone (especially women).<br /><br />The casting of the leads is absolutely perfect for this movie: Ehle and Firth are nothing short of amazing. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways. Firth's Darcy is a selfish man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Ehle's Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />They're also backed by an excellent supporting cast, with slimy clergy, screeching moms, sly seducers, sardonic fathers, innocent sisters and aristocratic old harpies adding colour to it all. Sawalha is especially good as the 19th-century Valley Girl, and Alison Steadman gives a grating but suitable performance as the whiny, marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennett.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the cream of the Austen crop, and an understatedly romantic movie as well. Definitely to be watched, again and again.nderstand.\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")  <br /> <br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds.

It gets Paul's piano style about right on \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\", but the right hand of \\"Lady Madonna\\" is wronger than George Bush. Don't despair: the left hand is correct (remember to play the offbeats staccato), and you'll find the correct right hand part at Musicnotes (which gets the left hand wrong).
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought this after a friend recommended it and I'm sitting here scratching my head, trying to gather my thoughts and wanting to listen to it again! There's really nothing I can compare this to, no point of reference.... I'm baffled! MAYBE the only comparison I could make is Canvas Solaris, as far as the frenzied time signature changes,but that falls severely short. Cedric... does sorta sound like an overdosing Robert Plant, but these guys are simply UNIQUE! I was trying to listen to this while doing some paperwork and had to shut it off. I couldn't focus on anything else because this recording is so dynamic, so complex ,that it DEMANDS your attention. My brain felt scrambled, baffled, shaken AND stirred! The musicianship is of the highest quality (although somewhat manic!), there aren't many actual melodies (this ain't pop music!), and it's just down- right enjoyable! Highly recommended to those who want unpredictable, flambouyant, effervescent music to the nth degree. Sounds like NOTHING else, I promise!
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|It was a good movie and entertaining. It did well in portraying several issues that transgender people face. However, it was not the most accurate movie. For example, it would be rare for someone to go to therapy and be told they have to go find their son before transitioning. So if you are looking for a movie to learn a lot about transgender people this isn't necessarily the way to do it. The story itself was campy.
0790733226|3.0|`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  Part I<br /><br />Originally, review of this movie found some fault with the short shrift given to the novel's breathtaking resolution.  Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content.  Computer graphics are ok, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie.  So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9/'02).  The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some `association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, \\"The Pentagon Propaganda Machine\\", largely channeled through the movies.<br /><br />So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library).  And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s.  Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book \\"Language and Problems of Knowledge\\".  The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character.  Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science.  I guess any theater company's rendition of `Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story.  Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro.  So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible.  I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape.  That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story.  Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in \\"Quantum Gravity\\" by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in `Minority Report'.<br /><br />What can be done?  Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could.  This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted.  (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in `Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie `The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens.  Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity.  Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth?  I doubt it.  And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like `The Matrix', `CUBE', `THX', `Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings.So who knows?  It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life.  Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century.  Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides.<br /><br />Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs.  That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe.  Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing.  In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like \\"Ozone Diplomacy\\".  The `official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.<br /><br />See the unsettling conclusion to the review on the soundtrack....tings.

B000683VI4|4.0|I love this movie to bits ends. <br />It's not because Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams catapulted to stardom or moved from reel-to-real live lovers,but rather,THE NOTEBOOK moves you tremendously as this is a heartwarming tale of two lovers who met as teenagers and were forcefully separated before reuniting some seven years later. <br /> <br />Ryan Gosling is the perfect candidate for Noah.He acts pretty well,and the transformation from a young teenage Noah (who reads poems and resorts to tricks fof girls to go on a date with him) to a angst and bitter adult (drinks and work at his workshop.Oh,that moustache helped too.Or is it a beard of a stubb or something? Gosling plays it well as the pretty boy who is innocent and falling in love for the first time to a bitter man seeking solace in a young widow. <br /> <br />Rachel McAdams fare better since her Mean Girls and The Hot Chick days.She plays Allie,and it proves that McAdams is a versatile actress.In Mean Girls,she was part of The Plastics,and she was clueless in Chick,while over here,in the Notebook,she's either busy kissing Gosling-turned real-life lover or screaming and yelling (she does that in the movie regardless whether she's happy or sad)or crying.She's a good actress.Allie seemed to come to life.Here,we see Allie falling in love with a country boy,Allie feeling bitter and miserable on leaving the love of her life,Noah, and Allie making a decision,Allie making love with Noah... <br /> <br />The movie is definitely better than the book.Nicholas Sparks is a good author,and please do not get me wrong.He is one of my favourite authors.It's just that the movie brings the book to life,it makes the book,and not vice-versa. <br /> <br />A good cast (thumbs-ups to the older Noah and Allie coupling! I never knew love can still be so passionate when you're greying and suffering from stroke and Alzheimer's),wonderful directorial debut and nice,lovely,paranomic scenery and views,what more can you ask? <br /> <br />
1594481938|5.0|On New Year's Eve, four people decide to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of a tower block. As the result of some inexplicable coincidence, they end up all four on the roof of the same building.<br /><br />They have nothing in common and don't know each other except Martin, a once popular TV host. He made the mistake to have a relationship with a-fifteen-year-old-who-looked-like-an-eighteen-year-old. As a result he's out of work, out of grace, and he lost his family life. He p... his life away, as he puts it so eloquently, and now he wants to jump all the way down.<br /><br />The second character is an American (the story takes place in Good Old England). His rock band is a failure and what's worse: he has an incurable disease.<br />Next is Jess, an eighteen year old girl. Her latest boyfriend dumped her. She wants an explanation from him but she can't find him so she wants to die.<br /><br />Finally there is Maureen. She's my favorite maybe because she's the only person who is really down and out.<br />She's a middle-aged single mother of a twenty year old boy. He can't speak, move, responds to nothing and can't eat by himself or go to the bathroom. He's a complete 'vegetable'. A nice word invented by our compassionate society.<br /><br />She's the only character I have sympathy for - not that I dislike the others - but she seems the only person who has nothing to go for. She has nothing to look forward to.<br /><br />The Sunday Times called it \\"extremely funny\\". I had a tooth ache when I read the novel and maybe that's why I can't say that it is extremely funny.<br />But it's still good for five stars.

B00005A46T|3.0|I am 14 years old and have got pretty much every slipknot album i wouldnt really call slpknot mainstream conisderring they have there own style of music and no one else plays like them they are definatly not nu-metal as they do not sound anything like Linkin Park or Limp Biskit. there are those people who say that Slipknot are rubbish. if they are why review it you clearly dont like them so dont appreciate the musicians they are so why bother your just going to say its rubbish. i am a huge slipknot fan and can admit its not there best album.that person who said to go listen to testament and exodus go do that if you want to go back to the 1970's im sure they were mainstream when they around so dont go tell people to go listen to it because its better. just so you know the lead guitarist of exodus , Kirk Hammet, left exodus to join a different band that band is called Metallica he left to join a good band. exodus may be good but they are nothing on Slipknot. and the guitarist for slipknot its pretty awesome considering hes rated one of the top guitarists around and can probably do better guitar solos then you. sorry this is more of a comeback to what the guy who dissed slipknot wrote. but this album is seriously good i reccomend you buy it right now.
B00005LOLD|5.0|I just watched Sayonara on TCM and I am still in awe of its beauty and subject matter.  This movie does not seem dated to me, aside from the cars and the clothes, even though it was filmed almost 50 years ago.  I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, and I was heartbroken at the suicide of Kelly and his young bride.  I was equally thrilled at the ending when Brando and Hana-Ogi rode off into the sunset.  However, I think Brando stunk in this movie, all he did was mumble in that horrible southern accent he put on.  However, here is something interesting:  the actress who played Hana-Ogi, Miiko Taka, was born in Seattle, Washington.  You wouldn't know that, would you, by listening to her or watching her? Great acting job by Ms. Taka.  Wonderful movie.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Notice how everyone who hates slipknot loves the really old bands like bon jovi, slayer, led zeppelin,the beatles and other stuff. sure they are good but if you are stuck in the 60's,70's and 80's this album is not for you this is for people who are into modern metal and like really heavy stuff with  loud vocals. its not the heaviest music in the world and corey doesnt have the best scream. but there music is just amazing.
B00005JOQS|5.0|It's been 19 years, but the Man of Steel is finally back!!  After going on an exploratory mission of his home planet Krypton after hearing it still existed Superman, (Brandon Routh)after discovering Krypton is an icy graveyard, returns to Earth to continue on with his life as Superman as well as his alter ego Clark Kent.  The trouble is, he's been gone for 5 years and the world has moved on without him.  Specifically, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who is now engaged to Richard White (James Marsden) and now has a son.  To make things worse, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has devised a devious plan to basically have the world at his feet by creating a new island from Kryptonite crystals.  Will Superman save the day and recapture Lois's heart?  Those are pretty much the two main questions in this outstanding motion picture from director Bryan Singer (X-Men, X-Men 2, The Usual Suspects).  Singer definitely taps into several aspects from the original Superman film from 1978 in this film but make no mistake, this movie stands on its own two feet and is without question its own movie.  Great writing, great script, great special effects, and great acting make this the majestic, incredible epic film that it is.  From the start of this movie, it grabs you and doesn't let go.  From the incredible airplane sequence at the beginning of the film to its final moving moments, this movie makes all the right moves.  Right from the getgo, it looks and feels like an instant classic and it follows through for the entire film.  Brandon Routh makes the role of Superman/Clark Kent his own with a brilliant performance that comes excruciatingly close to that of Christopher Reeve.  Kate Bosworth holds her own in most scenes as Lois Lane but if there was one weak link in this movie, it is her.  She just does not have it the way Margot Kidder did.  Kevin Spacey completely immerses himself in the role of the angry, bitter Lex Luthor, and some nice work from Parker Posey as well as Kitty Kowalski, Lex'sfemale acquaintance.  Frank Langella is good enough as Perry White, and James Marsden is interesting as Richard White, Perry's nephew.  For their supporting roles, Sam Huntington is fine as Jimmy Olsen and Eva Marie Saint is a convincing Martha Kent.  Kudos to director Bryan Singer as well for the archive footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and the unique way he incorporated that into the movie.  Superman Returns takes itself very seriously and is meant to be taken as such.  It is not a campy, silly movie that I think some people were expecting.  It is an epic in every sense of the word and is the better for it.  Without question one of the best superhero movies ever made, it is better than both Spiderman movies and bests most of the Batman films.  Though the story is obviously unrealistic the whole point of a movie of this nature is to provide complete escapism entertainment, which it does remarkably.  The movie is put together in such a way that it gives the viewer every reason to think that there will be a sequel and hopefully there will be one and hopefully Bryan Singer will be back to direct it.  Superman Returns has a runtime of 2 hours, 30 minutes and it is worth every second of it.  A hell of a movie no matter how you slice it.  After viewing this film for myself though, I can't help but wonder about some of the negative reviews of this film to include the Amazon reader reviews.  I don't see how a person could find nothing to like about Superman Returns.  It is unfortunate that some people's tastes are so shallow that unless something is being blown up every five minutes or if there isn't blood on the screen in every scene or an \\"action\\" scene every minute that it is a bad or \\"boring\\" movie.  This is an intelligent, smart movie made for smart people with depth and taste.  How refreshing it is to see a movie with a plot and an actual story instead of throwing a bunch of cheesy special effects in and hoping for the best.  One of the best movies of the year, Superman Returns is a memorable classic.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! At The Disco is a very gifted bad with extream music ability. The band was the first to be signed by Pete Wents of FallOutBoy. This cd is a mix of rock, dance, and classical music that is herd in parts of the album. To me this cd is abut love and sex but it is very good to lisen to with out being grossed out by what Brandon Urie ( lead vocalist ) Is singing. The theam of this band is that its baced in the urly 1900's with top hats and pettycoats. I Write Sins Not Tradeties was the first number one hit off the album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out on MTV'S TRL for 3 weeks!! If you buy the cd you will be amazed!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Annie Proux's short story is magnificently reproduced on the screen with Ang Lee's amazing cinematography.  It's as sparse and simple a tale as they get, but the drama is tense and sometimes unbearable.  Jack and Ennis are two sheepherders in 1963 Wyoming, working for little money that summer.  They unexpectedly fall in love, but each one takes a different path in life.  The film follows the result of their lives and their decisions over the next twenty years.  Most people have heard of this film, but those who have seen it can speak for the raw imagery and gut-wrenching story of love that cannot be fulfilled.  The pace is deliberate and every scene or piece of dialogue rings true.  This is an instant classic and one that will be remembered forever as the movie that used to be called the `gay cowboy movie'.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I called my daughter after watching the series finale and just cried my heart out because I just LOVE this show and to know that it will never be on again... *snif*  Please, please, PLEASE, they have to put the rest of the seasons on DVD!  This was the best written, best acted, best cast, best location of any show I've ever watched.  Week after week, I loved to get away to Everwood and usually at the end I'd be crying because the shows were so heartfelt but I never felt emotionally manipulated like so many of the stupid shows out there now.  And to see people of ALL ages interacting was wonderful too.  I can't tell you how tiresome it is to watch a show and never see anyone over the age of 30.  Funny I don't remember dying when I turned 40.  It was also good to see teens who had problems but weren't morons like on \\"The O.C.\\" and other shows of that ilk.  So, five stars, but it deserves its own constellation!!
B00008LDPU|4.0|If you are a fan of the Matrix then you need to pick this up.  It is nine short films from the world of the Matrix.  Most of them have nothing to do with the plot of the movie or its main characters.  But it explores certain things, which made everything fun. <br /> <br />For instance, what happens if somebody wants to go back into the Matrix, leaving the truth behind, and wants to bring a loved one from outside the Matrix with him?  (Fun plot twist at the end of that one) <br /> <br />Or, what happens when a part of the programming in the Matrix becomes corrupted and a bunch of school-kids wonder into the mishapped neighborhood? <br /> <br />Or, are there other ways outside the Matrix?  This actually looks at two of them. <br /> <br />My two (or three) favorites were the first three. <br /> <br />The first one had some of the best animation I've ever seen.  It was very lifelike, in fact, I thought for about thirty seconds I was watching real humans and not CG depictions of them.  Very, very lifelike. <br /> <br />The next two was the history of the machine takeover.  It is presented like you would find in a historical video of, say, World War II, that you might see in school.  It begins where the machines become defiant, then independant, then finally conquering.  It does answer the questions of why the Earth was destroyed and why the machines need humans.  It answered a few questions. <br /> <br />The remaining six where on a range of interesting to fun to boring.  But the entire DVD is still worth checking out. <br /> <br />A must see for all Matrix fans. <br /> <br />If you haven't watched the Matrix, don't rent this as you will be COMPLETELY confused by everything.  Check out the movie first.
B000654YRY|5.0|I tried to get this DVD for quite a while, and lost out a few times; once I got it, it stayed in the player for a couple weeks, and that was all I watched. I agree with another reviewer; as a guitar player, the closeups of Mark's fingers on the frets are invaluable (I even put it on slo-mo; there's no way you're gonna get it all watching at regular speed) and his grimaces of concentration show how much he puts into his work. (Good news; he hasn't changed.) Most of this material was from later Dire Straits efforts (the exceptions; Solid Rock, Romeo and Juliet, Private Investigations) but all was done cleanly and well, and it's patently obvious that the whole group is having a good time. It's always nice to see Mark smile. He smiles a lot on this tour.<br /><br />I never got the opportunity to see the Straits in concert - a sin I've remedied since Mark has been out on his own - but I can tell that everyone in the stadium where this concert was filmed was totally involved, as it's clearly raining hard near the stage but nobody seems to care in the least. This was a group that was bound to evolve into the class act it was, and like gentlemen, they bowed out before they got stale. Shame they didn't last longer, but by this point Mark was ready to explore other avenues; at least he didn't fade away.
0140274111|5.0|Just finished reading \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and let out a long sigh right after with a smile on my face. The ending may not necessarily be your typical happy-ending, nonetheless it is delightful. It was a re-read for me, for about like the 4th time and every time I have read it, I have found something different in it. While reading it this time I couldn't separate the movie from the book. Audrey and Peppard kept flashing in front of me as I was reading the book and it felt nice. As I type this so-called review I am listening to \\"Moon River\\" [instrumental] and watching Audrey in the opening credits. I love the book. According to me, no one can ever write a novella of such force [besides Marquez and Murakami] than that of Capote. As Norman Mailer said about it, \\"I wouldn't want to change any word of it. Its just perfect\\", that's exactly how I feel about it.<br /><br />Breakfast at Tiffany's - if you already do not know what its about, may be because you haven't read it - the plot is simple: It is about lost dreams, sometimes unrequited love and a whole lot of wit, profundity and the chance to go the whatever length in order to get what one wants. It is about Holiday Golightly [love the play of words] and her life or rather a fragment of her life, as seen through the eyes of the narrator Paul. Paul who loves Holly like all the other men in her life. Holly, who is also an escort/call girl. A girl who is all of twenty and possesses the wisdom of a thirty-year old without losing her naivety. Who believes that one mustn't betray friends, no matter what. Who jumps into a cab and visits \\"Tiffany & Co.\\" when she gets the `mean reds'. Holly is everything and more. She is promiscuous. She is brazen. She does things like stealing masks and as Billy Joel would put it, \\"She's always a woman to me\\"...<br /><br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is a novella with many layers to it. Abandonment, loneliness, the need to belong and yet not be chained at the same time, the delight in the unorthodox and last but not the least about not loving a wild thing. As Holly says in the book, \\"\\"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell...That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky\\"<br /><br />The book was written by Capote at the peak of his career. The somewhat \\"curious\\" title Breakfast at Tiffany's was inspired by a man from out-of-town that Capote heard about, who was \\"ignorant of New York\\". When the man was asked to pick from the best restaurants in New York where to eat breakfast, he replied: \\"Well, let's have breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" which was the only place he knew of.<br /><br />Written in 1958, it portrays a world in which women were invariably best seen and not heard, and totally reliant on men for money and worldly comforts. And yet Capote has created a female character that is largely independent and emotionally strong, although she's vulnerable too (loneliness, depression and desperation are hinted at). While she might be having a lot of fun, she's also on the run from a past that is forever trying to catch up with her as she tries to find a place that makes her feel as happy as Tiffany's does.<br /><br />All in all, this short novella is a joy to read. Capote's writing is typically rich and lyrical. He describes this woman in such a way that you get the sense he has moulded her on someone that intrigued him, that held some allure or had an aura of mysticism that left a deep impression.

B000B2YQX4|3.0|I consider myself something of a Depeche Mode fan, owning all the important albums from 1986 onward, and I must say, this disc was an overall disappointment.  Overproduced, intentionally loud, the tracks often come off jagged on the ear, and I couldn't help but think that I haven't really enjoyed a Depeche Mode album, like, really ENJOYED a Depeche Mode album, since 1996's \\"Ultra\\".<br /><br />In many ways, I think Depeche Mode hit its creative peak on \\"Music for the Masses\\" and \\"Violator\\".  Since then, things have been somewhat uneven.  I didn't like \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\", liked \\"Ultra\\", was lukewarm on \\"Exciter\\", and found myself let down by \\"Playing the Angel\\".<br /><br />To be sure, I'll always take Depeche Mode over much of modern pop music, and I give the boys credit for continuing to forge ahead, in spite of their legacy as one of the greatest 80's brit electronic bands of all time.  That Depeche has evolved and expanded its sound since the \\"Speak and Spell\\" days is a testament to their creativity and ability to grow.<br /><br />But somewhere along the line, I think they kind of got off the track.  At least with the last two albums.  Maybe the next album (if there is a next album?) will mark a return to more traditional Depeche Mode territory.  \\"Playing the Angel\\" seemed at times, to me, to be trying too hard.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|Isn't it a shame that others have to compare their own failures and impose them on a film? <br />I've read some of the revues here and frankly they have nothing to do with the film but only compare their own bitter experiences. <br />Over the years (many of them), I've bought this film because it brings hope and revives dreams. Yep, hope & dreams! Why? Easy, because all of us dream, or hope,  of finding the ideal relationship. The actors in this film make us believe that this is possible even if it is only during two days per year. <br />Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn will live forever in my mind as being the perfect couple. <br />Yeah, and when it comes out on high definition video, I'll buy it again :)

B000EMGAGW|2.0|Well Mobb Deep is another example of trying to make a comeback.  They had their classics with The Infamous and Murda Musik   Now they hope to hit it big with G-Unit on their debut Blood Money, but after a listen I'm wonderin to myself where's the old Prodigy and Havoc?    There are some flashes on here like on the forumlatic lead single \\"Put Em In Their Place\\" and \\"The Infamous\\" which takes you back to when the pair was at their best on classic albums like The Infamous and Murda Musik.  However you can tell that Mobb Deep is trying to go commercial at times with joints like \\"Let's Have A Party\\" and \\"Give It To Me\\".    Of course the formulatic problem with signing with G-Unit is on here: TOO MUCH 50 Cent.  It doesnt help when he goes to his routine of dominating the songs with doing his chorus on songs like \\"Creep\\", \\"Pearly Gates\\" and \\"It's Alright\\".  And there's the usual bling-bling track on here (\\"In Love With The Moulah\\").      Nothing else on the album really stands out here leaving fans with a not so good look on Mobb Deeps legacy.  And Prodigy really needs to work on his rappin style now.  Blood Money is just another example of rappers that have gone on the downslide going to G-Unit.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the best Broadway musical I have heard ever since Julie Andrews left the stage.  I have never seen the musical, but I can understand the whole story through the lyrics.  There isn't a bad song on this CD.  My personal favorites are \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" and \\"Defying Gravity.\\"  Kristen and Idina are amazing.  If you only buy one CD this year, buy this one.  You will not regret it.

B000F1IQNM|4.0|Academy award winning screenplay writer, Emma Thompson, did not set out to write an updated \\"modern\\" version of Mary Poppins.  I'm sure she's familiar with that classic.  Ms. Thompson did not set out to be redundant.  Like her lead character, Ms. Thompson set out to explore less common ideas.<br /><br />This is not Mary Poppins.  This is not a movie that suggests a spoon full of sugar is what is needed to help the medicine go down.  In Mary Poppins, Miss Poppins shows up beautiful.  In Nanny McPhee, the children learn of Nanny McPhee's beauty through the testing of her character.<br /><br />This is a tale of 7 smart children and a Nanny who thinks she knows 5 principles that may change their ingrained misbehaviors, behaviors that 17 prior nannies have failed to affect.<br /><br />\\"I have five lessons to teach.  What lessons they learn is entirely up to them.\\"<br /><br />1)  \\"I Did Knock\\" - Very politely show them how continuing their patterns of behavior may endanger the people they love.  (\\"I never say please\\" - The Kitchen/Baby scene)<br /><br />2)  Give them what they say they want and show them what happens.  (\\"Actually, I'm not sure it tis measles\\")<br /><br />3)  Show them what it is like to lose someone they love, someone they have taken for granted.  (\\"Evangeline\\")<br /><br />4)  Listen and recognize the tough questions your children ask.  Let them create their own solutions to undo the consequences of their own actions.  (\\"Think, you are very clever children.\\")<br /><br />5)  Lesson 5 is two-fold:  1)  Do exactly as you're told and show everyone the real consequences of those actions, & 2) When convention stands in your way, consider unconventional solutions:  Throw cake.  Make untraditional alliances.  Look at the people around you with new eyes.  Snow in August.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is not Mary Poppins.  Nanny McPhee is more direct and candid, knowing she is going where she is not wanted.  Nanny McPhee shows her love in unusual ways.<br /><br />I love Emma Thompson.  Love.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|The Amazon.com review calls this a movie about  \\"a female James Bond for the cyberpunk era.\\"<br /><br />I've seen more humanity expressed in the the robots/cyborgs from Lost in Space, The Hitchhiker's Guide, and Bladerunner.  In Aeon Flux, the emotive level reaches, say, the level of I, Robot, starring Will Smith.<br /><br />In other words, a turnip.<br /><br />Okay, I can appreciate the energy in the stunts, which really is the central part of this movie.  The story, in theory, is interesting (\\"400 years in the future, after a virus decimates the world population, only one city on Earth remains\\").  In \\"reality,\\" with one walled city, where does all of the food come from?  The concrete?  The energy?  The steel?  Technology is a bit more more complex than just putting up a wall and having everything you need.<br /><br />The twists in the plot are such that I really had to watch it again a few days later.  Who knew who and how?  What has been happening for 400 years?  How come the secret is known to such a select few?  Why doesn't the populace question the killings and disappearances?<br /><br />This is a movie to watch for the action.  You won't find any Tomb Raider dialogue here, or James Bond dalliances.<br /><br />With that proviso, enjoy.
B00005NGZX|1.0|everyone seems to think that this is a REALLY good metal album. i may not be giving it enough of a chance or something, but in my opinion this album is just irritating. they seem to have no concept sync and rythm. the vocalist sounds like he's stuck in a large metal tube that makes his voice both grating and hollow. amazon went as far as comparing this band to Slayer, but this band isn't good enough to lick the sweat from Kerry King's butt cheak. If you like Slayer, and you hate crap, then you won't like this cd either.
B00005JP5J|4.0|Like the other pre- (theatrical) release reviewers, we found LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE to be one of the funniest movies we've seen in a long time.  (Indeed, from what I understand, there is 'Oscar' talk in some of the movie industry about it.)  There were hearty laughs from all areas of the theater.  It is hard to tell if this is a comedy or a satire; but then, truth is the soul of wit, and here we have truth exaggerated in a very sophisticated manner.  There is a bit of slapstick - such as the way the uncle runs into the hotel, or what happens after Grandpa dies - but most of the movie simply overstates situations we've all experienced or are aware of happening in our culture.    Unfortunately, it seems even independent movie producers cannot refrain from making the usual Hollywood 'digs' at traditional family or religious values.  There was absolutely no reason whatsoever for Dwayne (the son) to wear a T-shirt saying \\"Jesus Was Wrong\\" for much of the movie.  Grandpa could have been an even more funny character without showing him snorting drugs.  Also, he could have used colorful language without using the various strings of cursing the movie chose to have him use.  To the movie's credit, from a traditional values viewpoint, when little Olive learned that her uncle had once had a homosexual lover, she said, \\"That's dumb.\\"  One thing is for sure:  although this movie is about a little girl and her family, it is definitely not for children.    So, while diminished by some of the usual Hollywood attacks on traditional family and religious values, it is one of the genuinely funniest movies to come along in a long time.  The secrets of its success is that it presents mostly everyday situations people can relate to in utterly comical ways.  I think I can also safely say that the hilarious climax was something nobody in the theater ever thought of!  Adults can really enjoy this movie, but because of the language, drugs and sexual talk, children should be left at home from thetheater or restricted from watching the eventual DVD.
0440211727|4.0|I really am enjoying the audio recording of this book, but the one thing that really bothers me is the repeated use of the n word, to the point that it seems a bit gratuitous. I understand that sometimes authors feel language that is offensive is warranted for a period or regional piece, but I think there is a fine line between creating a sense of believability and just plain overdoing it.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I have to say when I first got into this movie I was a little put off by the in-your-face politics.  Essentially this starts out as a liberal propaganda piece against every issue imaginable.  It does , however, develop into a compelling story with a lot of graphic and stunning cinematography    Things are not quite as they seem as you watch this movie and that is why I give it a high rating.  The movie effectively uses your biases to lead and mislead your perceptions throughout the story.    The basic plot is that a diplomat's activist wife is brutally raped and murdered.  Your job is to figure out who did it and why.  There are lots of twists and turns and a climatic finish.    Just remember this is a movie and is not based on any sort of true story nor does it claim to be.  In movies there can be villains of all sorts and you do not necessarily have to object to this one just because of political views. I am sure you have seen the Fugitive and the bad guys in that were of the same sort.  Personally I believe the wife's political views to be misguided at best and in the real world alienate those that actually help her causes.    A final thought (a friend's actually, but I like it) for those of you that complain about the cost of medicine.  When you start your own company and produce your own medicines, you can feel free to charge whatever you want.  The one exception to this is if you owned the pharmaceutical company that the Clinton administration blew up.  I guess that was his way of protecting American industries.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable. <br /> <br />I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.  <br /> <br />The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?
B0000028VT|4.0|After the success of Mariah Carey and Emotions, Music Box saw the day of light in 1993, venturing on to become Mariah's best selling album worldwide. Music Box spawned some of Mariah's biggest hits; Without You, Dreamlover and Hero while also providing Mariah Carey with massive popularity within Europe.     As the upbeat and bubbly Dreamlover was released to introduce people to Music Box, it landed Mariah a no. 1 position on the single chart in America. The song has a r'n'b sound to it, perhaps indicating that Mariah already knew in what direction she wanted her music to steer towards. Dreamlover is one of my favorite songs and it was this particularly song, which got me interested in Mariah's music. The power-ballad Hero is a favorite among many, its uplifting lyrics are a tad corny and childish for my liling. Yet I have never been a big Hero fan; however it must have had somewhat of an impact as it managed to reach no. 1 in America. Anytime You Need A Friend is clearly one of the best offerings on Music Box. Its gospel-like features and the choir assisting Mariah work perfectly together. The title-track is not all that interesting. In fact, many of the non-released songs are blend and forgettable. As the case with Mariah's Emotions album, Music Box also suffers from a weak ending of the album. Songs such as Just To Hold You Once Again, I've Been Thinking About You, All I've Ever Wanted and Everything Fades are nice songs; however I tend to skip them. Sure, they are listenable - yet I cannot remember what they sound like until I actually hear them for myself.     Now That I Know and Never Forget You are enjoyable songs. Now That I Know distinguishes itself from the rest of the songs on the album. Its fast pace and contagious beat makes the song a welcoming offering. Never Forget You is a Babyface production - just think Madonna's Take A Bow, TLC's Red Light Special  and Diggin On You as well as Toni Braxton's Breathe Again - which, in my opinion, are far superior songs that Never Forget You. Despite the corny lyrics, the slowly mid-tempo Never Forget You is not all bad. I still enjoy listening to it despite its flaws. Without You is probably Mariah's biggest hit in Europe, landing Miss Carey her first UK no.1. It is a powerful ballad, which surely displays Mariah Carey's ability to take a cover version and make it her own.     I do not consider Music Box among Mariah Carey's best albums, yet it is certainly not among her worst. The singles are definitely the highlights on the album: Dreamlover, Hero, Anytime You Need A Friend and Without You. They are the reasons for buying the album. However, there are too many dull and average ballads. Buy a Mariah Carey greatest hits, if you are a newcomer to her music. However, Music Box is a nice record to have among your other Carey albums.    Overall Rating: 7/10
B00005JOQS|5.0|Last week, I purchased the \\"Superman Returns\\" soundtrack, and have listened to it daily with a treadmill thundering under my feet ever since.  Viewing the movie four times, I loved it more each time.  However, listening to the awesome soundtrack has illuminated and informed my vision of the movie, rendering it profound.  John Ottman stands on John Williams' shoulders, but what artist doesn't stand on many shoulders?  Crafting the new score without Williams' Superman themes would have required massive arrogance.  Instead, Ottman rejuvenates Williams' themes, adding dimensions encompassing Heaven and Hell in the cosmic space of the new score.    Ottman's thug themes remind me of Leonard Bernstein's bad boys in \\"West Side Story,\\" but they've now grown to full scale demons.  Listening to their themes clashing with Superman's themes, I hear angels and insects.  Visually, Lex Luthor's dark-crystal world, a paradise lost, is surely chaos built of Milton's \\"dark materials.\\"  Attacking Kal-el, Luthor and his gang echo a \\"West Side Story\\" street fight, but Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor has the seductively brilliant sparkle and vengeful arrogance of Milton's supreme fallen angel.  He stands apart casting \\"baleful eyes\\" on his \\"horrid crew\\" who pummel Superman, and they appear as if \\"rolling in the fiery gulf\\" of invisible flames and visible darkness in Milton's Hell.  Brutal hurling sends Kal-el's fetal form rolling and colliding sharply against rocks.  The wing-like cape curling around his tumbling body evokes car-struck birds and demon-tossed angels.  Meanwhile, musical light fights dark on a cosmic scale: from deepest voice, percussion and brass to angelic vocals, woodwind and harp, a full spectrum of musical sounds joins the battle.  During \\"Not Like a Train Set,\\" one eerily deep female voice, reminiscent of a grieving Lothlorien Elf, renders just two notes for one of my favorite musical moments.  The battle of stressful sounds rages on in a contemporary mode recalling the music of Philip Glass.  Superman's villains, enemies of our time, flourish in this musical setting.    Furthermore, musical resonance with \\"West Side Story\\" refers indirectly to Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\"  In the film, Superman stands happily transfixed, his x-ray gaze following a Lois Lane warmly wrapped in golden light as she ascends via elevator to the Daily Planet's roof.  Accompanying music levitates me with her.  Subliminally and humorously, Superman may be musing that his lady love is flying, and they are not so different after all.  On another level, he is Romeo, and Juliet is headed for the balcony.    All goodness flows from love, and Superman embodies goodness in the epic struggle.  Therefore, it is important that we fall in love with Superman and what he represents: the love story and the battle epic are inseparable.  If we fall in love with goodness (Superman), we can take our power from the source of light (sun), bringing active compassion into our world.  Superman Returns  does accomplish this task for us.  We do fall in love with goodness, and we are invested with power for good.    In addition, I have no problem contemplating a Christ-like Kal-el floating for several beats before he plummets.  Why rush forward to a plot point, thereby obscuring the transcendent moment?  Contemplation and transcendence are peak experiences we can recover from this movie.  I have no problem with a Christ-like figure sacrificing more than once either--if we were to bear the pain of sacrifice once, would we do it again?  The archetypal redeemer who dies and rises again has been around since the dawn of agricultural society: the plant dies, and the seed rises again to feed us.  The archetype's spiritual truth exists beyond organized religion's expressions of it.  A movie like \\"Superman Returns\\" triumphs by liberating the truth from partisan stains and trappings.  Similarly, while we hope that truth and justice are the American way, it would be best if truth and justice were the way of the world.    \\"Superman Returns\\" engenders hope, and the persistence of hope together with expectation of grace is our only fail-safe antidote for the soul-destroying state of our times.  Movie-makers are magicians.  Boys and girls at play, they make us believe a man can not only fly, but may take external control of a renegade jet with his bare hands: it's great.  At some point in the creative process, higher consciousness breaks in, adopting the elements of play for its own purpose.  Magicians give us art then.  John Ottman, Bryan Singer, writers, actors, and everyone else who worked on \\"Superman Returns\\" have given us art: all we need do is open ourselves to its effects.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|It never stops amazing me how selfish people are.  This movie, I feel, is a very accurate telling of how people change and try to manipulate others.  The characters are all very likable even though they are doing and saying horrible things to each other.  In short, a great movie that everyone should at least see once.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I grew up with the original Star Trek and Lost in Space and Firefly is the best science fiction I have run across in a long time.  I love the characters, the premise and the stories are so engaging, it seems like you just started the DVD and it's over! Goes by way to fast.  I wish the show had continued as I think it would have been a smash hit but apparently, the network only ran it for half a season then canceled it without warning.  I suggest anyone who likes great stories get this set.  The only down side is you will get hooked and be begging for more and aside from the feature film, Serenity, that's all there is.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|We've seen this sort of thing before. An undisciplined, underachieving team is taken over by a tough, no-nonsense coach who turns them into winners. Gene Hackman did his turn as the coach in Hoosiers. Heck, even Goldie Hawn (Wildcats) and Cathy Lee Crosby (Coach) played the pivotal mentor role, which just goes to show that Hollywood will do anything, including crossing gender boundaries, to cash in on the coach-turns-losers-into-winners storyline.    But Coach Carter manages to rise above the cliche. There are several reasons for this, the first and most obvious being Samuel L. Jackson's gritty performance as the title character. Jackson, a man of enormous talent but unfortunately not known for being very selective with his roles, made a good decision with this one. In a resume that covers a range of movies from the outright disastrous to the so-so to the pretty good to the very good, his work in this movie certainly ranks among his finest performances.    A close second reason this movie works in spite of its formula storyline is the fact that it's based on a true story. The same can be said for Hoosiers, but what sets Coach Carter apart is the fact that Carter demanded that his players be not just good athletes, but also good role models. Your typical sports movie is usually just about the sport, about the winning attitude, what makes champions, etc. Carter's definition of a champion was not limited to on-court performance. He took the concept a step further, requiring his players to follow a dress code, maintain good grades, and observe proper behavior off the court.    Now, on the down side: I don't know how accurate the depiction of Carter's drill sergeant tactics was, but I do know that having high school students do 500 pushups is utterly ridiculous. A typical healthy human body can barely do 100. Also, can someone please explain how one man (Carter's assistant, Clyde) can keep count of eight or nine players' pushups and suicides? (This is during the scene where the players help Timo Cruz get back into the team by doing these exercises for him.) In another scene, Carter interrupts a teacher in mid-lecture -- in mid-sentence in fact -- to ask about one of his players who's supposed to be in that class. I used to be a teacher, and I know that whether you're a fellow-teacher, a coach, or even the principal, you do not walk into a classroom (or a laboratory, as in this scene) and interrupt a teacher while he/she is talking to his/her students. Not even with a polite \\"excuse me.\\" Then there's the scene in the final seconds of the game against St. Francis. The ball is inbounded, and the clock is ticking while it's still in the air. The time shouldn't run until it touches a player. Another poster here also pointed out that some people in the gallery were smiling during these final tense seconds, a completely unnatural behavior under those circumstances. I agree with him.    Still, in spite of these flaws, Coach Carter delivers. Proof that even a by-the-numbers story, when well-told, can work.     Oh, there's one other reason this film rises above the cliche, and that's the way it ends. I won't give away any more than that. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to give it a shot. You don't even have to be a sports fan to appreciate it, because this isn't just about sports. It's about being a winner, both on and off the court.
0743454529|1.0|I put aside this beautful, sunny weekend to wrap myself around My Sister's Keeper and was engrossed in this sorrowful family tragedy, completely involved in the moral/ethical web that entangled each of the characters. I wept for the mother, the daughters and indeed, each member of the family. I did not know what to think as each new piece of evidence unfolded. It was obvious there could be no happy outcome for this family, but was there a way to navigate these relentless, tumultuous waters with some form of love and possibly even grace? I wanted to witness this, through the eyes of this family, and learn something from them. <br /> <br />I looked to Jodi Picoult to show me the way. What a mistake. Instead she takes you almost 400 pages into this story and then drops you into a Harlequin romance novel with a ridiculous ending that requires absolutely no decision making by the characters at all. Life just happens to deliver the answer to their door. I am furious. Did she just get tired of writing or did she not know how to handle this horrifying dilemma she got us into? And if she didn't know how to get us out, why did she drag us in? <br /> <br />I'll never read another one of her books again.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Looking back at all the childhood cartoon movies I had, I realize that Anastasia ranks among my favorites. It has a couple of faults, but I loved it and I still do. <br /> <br />There are two primary faults to the movie. Firstly, the animation struggles at times with capturing particular human expressions. Secondly, it is not clever historical fiction because of the sacrifices it had to make over facts. <br /> <br />However, I believe this movie to be greater than the sum of its parts. The songs were amazingly wonderful. The development between Anastasia and Dimitri pulls at heartstrings. The mystic Rasputin arouses the disdain only proper for a movie villian. This is altogether a wonderful movie I would like to own on DVD.
B0000A118M|5.0|If it's not, it's second to Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. No matter, this is a masterpiece, and hard to review objectivelly simply because it's so damn good. It's one of the few albums that both the music fan and musician (similar to Trane, I play tenor sax) in me can appreciate. This is a masterful album-long suite, released after Trane kicked his heroin habit (sadly, he died a few years later), devoted to God. And it's truly a moving piece, with Trane's lyrical tenor and, at times, soprano sax dominating. That's not to discredit the rest of the band, of course, since they play brilliantly. But Trane steals the spotlight, treating our ears to both his ridiculous talent and his formidable skills with a melody (particularly on pt. 4, which is an instrumental set to the meter of Trane's poem in the liner notes). Music, no matter the genre, doesn't really get much better than this. I know I sound like some raving cult member, but these days we jazz fans sadly are a cult. Anyhoo, buy this today along with Kind of Blue by Miles Davis. Neither record will disappoint.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original.  Someone should have told him he was remaking King Kong - not Mighty Joe Young.  Ann Darrow is not supposed to fall in love with Kong, Kong's supposed to fall in love with her.   <br /> <br />I could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.   <br />I could go on and on, but suffice to say this was a huge dissappointment.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" is by far one of the best musicals to debut in years. The original Broadway cast recording features the dazzling vocal talents of Idina Menzel as Elphaba and Kristen Chenoweth as Glinda. The musical (which is based on Gregory Maguire's novel of the same name) tells the story of the life of the Wicked Witch of the West, who has been immortalized as one of the greatest villains in movie history. \\"Wicked\\" tracks Elphaba's (a.k.a. the Wicked Witch) life story from birth to university, where she ends up with the spoiled, self-absorbed Glinda as a roommate. It turns out that Elphaba isn't really wicked at all: she's actually more of a \\"good witch\\" than Glinda, especially in the beginning. These two very different women form an unlikely friendship, and they are ultimately torn apart when Elphaba learns about the corrupt and evil dealings of the Wizard of Oz and decides to take matters into her own hands. There's also a love triangle between the two witches and Fiyero, a fellow student at Shiz University. Elphaba and Glinda eventually find themselves making different choices that lead them on two different paths. Unlike Maguire's novel, the musical version of \\"Wicked\\" has a semi-happy ending, and the show challenges people to recognize the illusions of good, evil, and beauty.<br /><br />The music and songs in this show are truly outstanding. Menzel and Chenoweth are both outstanding vocalists. They shine in their solo numbers (\\"The Wizard and I,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" \\"Perfect\\") and blend wonderfully together (\\"What is This Feeling?,\\" \\"For Good\\"). The soundtrack also features a beautiful love song performed by Elphaba and Fiyero (\\"As Long As You're Mine\\") as well as several outstanding ensemble numbers (\\"No One Mourns the Wicked,\\" \\"One Short Day\\").<br /><br />I have a feeling that every person who sees this show eventually ends up buying this CD. If you aren't able to see the show in person, this CD is the next best thing. You'll listen to it all the time!
B000002J0B|4.0|I picked this up thinking I was going to love it.  I like creative efforts and this is certainly a very creative effort by a band wary of being pigeon-holed as heavy rockers.  The members of this band have lots of depth and musical prowess and they are clearly reaching for the sky here - and that's a good thing.  I have some reservations about this recording though...<br /><br />The music is fantastic on this release and it contains some of my favorite Zeppelin tracks, especially \\"No Quarter\\".  But there are a few of things about Houses of the Holy that bug me:<br /><br />1.  The vocal treatment on Plant's voice on The Song Remains the Same is bothersome.  At the end Plant is making noises that uncannily resemble the noises Yoko Ono used to get panned (rightly so) for doing on stage and on record with hubby John Lennon.  Whatever they've done to his voice throughout the song, it has a very closed-in feeling. It sounds as if he is singing from inside a big wet ball of dryer lint - in technical terms, the voice track has no acoustic dynamic - it sounds like he's singing inside dead air space - like a heavily carpeted room.  I hate this effect on his voice, especially in this otherwise incredible piece of upbeat music.  Towards the end it sounds like a delireously stoned chipmunk singing out of a damp hole in the ground in a very wet forest...  how's that for descriptive?<br /><br />2.  D'yer Make'r just doesn't belong in this suite of otherwise great songs.  It made a happy little danceable single back in the day but they should have left it off of this otherwise great work of art.  There was a time when Brit bands used to do that all the time with singles - they felt it was cheating to include a single on an Lp - witness the Stones UK releases of Aftermath, Beggar's Banquet, and Between the Buttons and you'll see what I mean.  I like the song, just not sandwiched into Houses of the Holy.<br /><br />3.  The Crunge is a very enjoyable homage to soulman James Brown and includes a playful take on Brown's trade-mark \\"Take me to the bridge!\\" heard frequently in his recordings.  But the synth sounds dated, I would love to hear this remixed with a real horn section instead of that crappy synthesizer.  Overall, I like this song a lot, but it seems out of place here and that synth playing what would otherwise be a good horn section line is just too cheesy.  Note: with very few exceptions, synthesizers used in music from this and/or any other era of music typically blow as far as I'm concerned.  They're always overused and in the long run, the sound seldom holds up because unlike guitar, bass, drum, organ, sax, etc., the pace of technology is always changing rapidly.  As a rule, something played on synths that sounded really great a few years back usually sounds ancient now.  Me hates 'em.<br /><br />Overall, Houses of the Holy is a great record with some small flaws that might not bother some listeners.  As a side note, if I recall correctly, those are Plant's children on that very atmospheric cover.  Cool piece of art that.<br /><br />Rating the Zeppelin Releases Overall:<br /><br />Most Bestest Goodest Fantasticest Ever:  Physical Graffiti<br />Most Best:  Led Zeppelin IV<br />Best: Led Zeppelin III<br />More Betterer:  Led Zeppelin II<br />Inconsistent but Great:  Houses of the Holy (almost a masterpiece, lose the wet chipmunk, the synths and psuedo rasta-man stuff and it's a masterpiece)<br />Pretty Good: Led Zeppelin I<br />Somewhat Good:  Presence<br />Sort of Ok:  In Through The Outdoor (Synth madness)'s trade-mark \\"Take me to the bridge!\\" heard frequently in his recordings.

B000EQ47GS|1.0|Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am one of the greatest fans of Tom Scholz and the music of Boston on the planet; heck, the galaxy! <br /> <br />I just recieved both remasters and have heard most of the debut; I am currently listening to 'Something About You'. <br /> <br />Aside from a couple of (what I think are) compression bump-ups and minor edits in timing intervals I caught, there is nothing I've heard so far that leaves me 'feeling satisfied' with this purchase. Having gone from LP to cassette to CD, I've just purchased these same 2 collections of songs for the 4th time.  <br /> <br />Considering that I thought 'Don't Look Back' was the weaker of the two the first time, I'm not sure I want to risk being disappointed by even listening to its remaster. <br /> <br />I am truly disappointed. As one who knows how to use Protools, there is nothing I've heard so far that I couldn't have done myself from the consumer stereo masters. <br /> <br />In the time it's taken me to compose this note, I listened to the remainder of the debut and am now listening to 'Don't Look Back'. It does sound like they've bumped up the bottom end and the overall level a bit. Again, easily achieable with a 60Hz bass boost button found on most boom boxes and a tweak of the volume dial. Certainly not worth investing in a new CD. I recall reading somewhere that those behind this work spent some 80 hours \\"painstakingly\\" working on the touch ups that produced this. If anyone out there actually knows these guys, don't hire them to produce or remaster any audio for you. Download some freeware audio editing software (they're all pretty good now) and start experimenting. You'll realize just how easy it really is and that these guys actually accomplished nothing worth bragging about. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. I still think these two collections of songs are among the finest in the world of what is now dubbed 'classic rock' and they still make my heart bounce. I just don't feel that I'm actually hearing anything different; or at least nothing substantial enough to classify this as a remaster and warrant repurchasing them. It's not that it's any worse; it just isn't any better either - as audio goes.  <br /> <br />As for the new liner notes, they're awesome. If you consider that worth spending $10 per CD for, then you've redeemed your money's worth. <br />                          <br />So I am now listening to 'Used To Bad News', meaning I've heard all of the debut and a good chunk of 'Don't Look Back'. I say, don't waste your money; really! I also seem to recall that even the liner notes are on-line somewhere  (including photos) so you can read them without spending a dime. So don't! Don't spend the dime. Enjoy the original recordings. They are still the greatest! <br />                  Peace & Love <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002JSN|5.0|More on the lawsuit later in the review.<br /><br />Physical Graffiti is hands down Led Zeppelin's greatest release.  Physical Graffiti is to Led Zeppelin what Exile on Mainstreet was to the Rolling Stones.  Graffiti is a sprawling treasure trove of different musical styles that somehow all hang together beautifully.<br /><br />The boys play a wide range of music, opening with the intensely loud blues \\"Custard Pie\\".  Disc 1 is mainly Zeppelin doing their best to blow out your woofers and ends with the epic, majestic Kashmir.<br /><br />Disc 2 is a bit more experimental and opens with the inspiring \\"In The Light\\". There's also some pop tunes like \\"Down By the Seaside\\" and nice acoustic guitar pickin' piece with \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\".  It also features my all-time favorite Zeppelin composition \\"Ten Year's Gone\\" which is at once beautiful and majestic sounding.  \\"Boogie With Stu\\" was recorded with the original, life-time, voting, but mostly unknown member of The Rolling Stones, Ian Stewart. Stewart was actually a member of the band before Watts and Wyman came aboard and was an unseen member until the day he died.  Boogie With Stu is great fun, employs a ridiculous sounding percussion device, I have no idea what Bonham is playing but it's great fun.  Led Zeppelin were actually sued by the Richie Valen's estate for this song and you can see they've add Mrs. Valens as a co-writer for the purposes of royalty sharing.<br /><br />I have all of the Zeppelin release up to Physical Graffiti. This is the 800lb gorilla of the Led Zeppelin catalog and if there is one CD you purchase by Zeppelin, spend your hard earned pennies on Physical Grafitti.[...]
0385336691|3.0|I don't get the Jack Reacher hype at all. This is the kind of pot boiler you'd buy in airport bookstores. Read it and throw it away. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, but there are hundreds of others like Jack Reacher. Try Clive Cussler or Jack Higgins or any of the others.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is the sound that I loved from their earlier albums. They are back with the disgracefully powerful messages that got them into the spotlight. While in Best Buy, I saw this album and it was recommended by a passerby as \\"The best Tool album you will ever buy.\\" With such an astounding boast, I had to give this a try. I am not at all dissapointed.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|How could one complain about this disc when the picture quality is so sharp and clear, the sound quality second to none and a full song list representing all their well known music through the years. I really cannot fault this disc and everyone who has seen it, has enjoyed it. At 2 hours 10 minutes it's just like being at one of their concerts. Bravo.

B00000J2PH|5.0|This woman gets the highest RESPECT from me. I am under 35 years old and i have grown up to really appreciate REAL talent as I see and hear it. Carole King is simply a brilliant artist, period! I never get tired of listening to her, or anything she has written. This is a TRUE artist. To me she can't do no wrong. It is a shame that we are living in times where musical artists just simply SUCK! Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Nick Lachey, all the corny boy bands, the gansta rappers and even the Spice Girls and ALL like them just STINK! There's No more talent anymore. Today any anorexic blonde under 25, with a skweaky voice can have a hit record, as long as the voice is fixed in the studio. Artists like Carole King and anyone with her talents and more need to erase these idiots off the face of the earth. Please where ever you are...COME BACK!!!
B00001OH7G|5.0|I have been a guitarist my whole life and I listen to all the greats in blues, jazz, and rock and Rory Gallagher is probably the best guitarist to date...with the exception of Mike Bloomfield.  Although guitarists like Clapton and Hendrix have contributed to the evolution of rock n roll guitar and its textural sound, Rory Gallagher is a better guitarist than both. Rory is much more fluent in roots music like blues, folk, celtic, and rock than that of Hendrix and Clapton. Rory's live performances dworf that of Hendrix and Clapton. If you are looking for a rock album that will knock your socks off...purchase Rory's Irish Tour album. It will show you exactly what I'm talking about. Another masterpiece is Live in Europe. Trust me, you will wonder why he wasn't more popular..which is still a mystery.  Oh, by the way, you do not nee dto be a guitarist to love Rory...my best friend is not a musician at all and loves the guy.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|Sequels are hit and miss nowadays. I was a bit wary but still excited when \\"Underworld\\" was going to have a spin-off. Thankfully my wariness was unfounded with \\"Underworld: Evolution\\". The war between death dealers (vampires) and lycans (werewolves) continues on. The film opens up with a flashback to the beginning of the feud between the two clans. Kate Beckinsale returns as the heroine Selene and Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin who is a hybrid mix between vampire and werewolf. Together they are on a quest to stop Marcus Corvinus (Tony Curran) from releasing his imprisoned lycan brother William as well as to unlock the secrets to their respective clans' past.<br /><br />I personally found \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" much more engaging than the original. The storyline was more developed than the original. I love cinematography. The blue light captured the dark undertones of the story. The action sequences were far more exciting. I loved the opening sequence. I wish there was more told about both clans and what eventually led to their centuries old feud. Hopefully there will be a prequel to the series. It would answer everyone's questions.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Hmm...I've seen some poorly written reviews that are unhelpful and just written out of emotion. Instead of reviewing the merchandise and telling readers why they should/should not buy this album, reviewers are writing simply to either disregard this music or love it with all their heart. Hopefully I can write a better review. <br /> <br />Honestly, this music is only for people who like rap and rock mixed together. If you're in the mood to be angry or just like a lot of bass and/or rap, then this is the album for you. I personally think this album is put together well in terms of music, not necessarily Fred Durst's voice/rapping skills. That is my main attraction to this cd: bass. <br /> <br />Fred Durst doesn't sing, merely because this is the genre that their band has taken up. Anthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers) doesn't always sing, and they're great. Music isn't about who sounds good or who has artistic ability any more; it's about popularity, which is what Limp Bizkit is trying to retain. Another reviewer (I am not trying to pick on the previous reviewers here) stated that Limp's music videos were number one on TRL. No offense to the reviewer or anyone else out there, but having a number one video on TRL means pretty much nothing since a person never even sees most of the video when it's on tv. Not to mention that TRL (Total Request Live) is not reliable for votes or opinions since they are all about attracting viewers for the show. <br /> <br />By swearing excessively, screaming, and rapping along with the strums of a guitar and bass player, Limp Bizkit lures in the angsty teenagers from everywhere. It is who they speak to, which is why so many people dislike them. \\"My Way\\", one of the singles, screams to the listener that the speaker is going to get his way. Seriously, the lyrics are not that well put together since Durst mostly repeats himself to keep a catchy tune. But again, Limp Bizkit is all about rock and not necessarily lyrics. \\"Rollin'\\" is a fun, popular song (of its time) only meant to really be played while you're driving your car at 80MPH. \\"Getcha Groove On\\" is fun to listen to because Fred has the guest rapping of Xzibit. \\"Take A Look Around\\" borrows the Mission Impossible theme, keeping the attraction to the song. These songs are based on attraction and popularity to a listener. <br /> <br />I honestly like this album, but like most music, it is not for everyone. But again, I'm mostly attracted to bass and guitar, not necessarily good lyrics or vocals. <br /> <br />Hopefully this will help you instead of tell you exactly what to buy or what not to buy. If you like Korn, you will probably like Limp Bizkit.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite films ever!  This has got to be Keira Knightley's best performance so far!!!!  I have not seen the \\"first\\" Pride and Prejudice, but I think I don't have too with this timeless classic.  Keira should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance!  The thing this DVD misses the mark on is the special features.  It didn't even have the theatrical trailer.  The picture is breathtaking and a true masterpiece!  A MUST SEE AND OWN!!!!!
B000BYA5GO|4.0|... but 'Lord of War's' sardonic tone brings it a lot closer to 'Dr. Strangelove.'<br /><br />As a movie, 'Lord of War' is fast-paced and vivid, with Nicolas Cage blithely shrugging off his chosen profession of gun-running as just something he is good at ... as if to say, he would sell vacuum cleaners door to door instead, if he were good at that.<br /><br />As fact, the movie seems roughly accurate in noting the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting chaos that loosened controls on its weapons (regular and nuclear). But the postscript noting the United States as one of the world's top weapons merchants was simplistic ... look at China, Russia and France, if you want to know where all cheap, simple arms floating around Somalia, the Sudan, Liberia and Iraq came from! (Source: BBC).<br /><br />It may be slightly preachy during a scene involving slaughter at a refugee camp, but it's nothing compared to Syriana.
B000056K04|2.0|Picked it up at Tower the other day ($9.99),because I like the DMB and now I see you can pick it up at Amazon for a $1.36. <br /> <br />At that cheap of a price,that should pretty much clue you in that something was up. <br /> <br />Not a very good outing(bad production). <br /> <br />Murky.fuzzy.lacking in general fidelity. <br /> <br />It sounds as if it were dubbed to death. <br /> <br />Were these guys even together in the same recording studio ? <br /> <br />DMB is a \\"jam\\" band, and this album just sounds as if that magical element is missing. <br /> <br />When I listen to other DMB albums,it sounds(and feels)like everybody is having a good time. <br /> <br />Kind of wooden and by the numbers on this one. <br /> <br />When DMB is on ,they are as good as it gets,but when they are off... <br /> <br />I wanted to pick up the newer DMB,but since Sony pulled the DRM incident,that album will not be on my playlist ANYTIME soon.
B00005JNQA|2.0|I give it two stars for the theme of the movie and plot which is unique! Unfortunately, I had watch this movie at two different times in order to \\"get into it.\\" I couldn't help but fastforward the last 30 minutes because I just wanted it to be over with!!!  If no one screened this movie before it was put on DVD, it shows! I'd rather watch tv than this movie!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack was absolutely fantastic. After watching the first movie, the one thing that really stuck with me was, \\"I WANT THAT MUSIC, and I MUST HAVE IT NOOOOW.\\" I positively drooled over it when I purchased it and listened in depth for the first time.  <br /> <br />The song titles can be virtually ignored when it comes to listening. Just by thinking of what happens in the movie, you can place the various songs, and from then on, each song evokes mental images.  <br /> <br />Well orchestrated, fast paced, and tons of fun to listen to, this score will remain amongst soundtrack lovers for many years.

B00005MP58|3.0|After watching and loving the new version of Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, we were told that this previous BBC verion was actually better. The reasoning was simply that it was longer and the characters were more developed, and the star power represented in the film was comparable to the more recent version.    We were quite disappointed. Practically nothing compares to the newer version, whatever the literary critics might say about their relative relationship to Austen's classic. Cinematographically, the newer version is simply superior. This includes artistic camera shots, costuming, sets, lighting, and pretty much anything else you can think of. The old version simply isn't nearly as pleasing to the eye. The same goes for casting. The actors' appearances go hand in glove with my description of other matters, and to be blunt, the acting isn't that good in the BBC version  (or if one desires a positive spin, it's better in the new one). In the end, the acting was not believable in the older version. Darcy's complexities, for example, are simply portrayed by a quizzical expression; his remarks about Lizzie, tone of voice, and expression are not romantically enigmatic, just confusing. Lizzie similarly is portrayed very oddly. Worst of all is Mrs. Bennett. The character is not annoying in a way that make you identify and sympathize with her beleaguered husband and daughters (as in the new), but in a way that makes you sympathize with anyone who has to sit through the actress's attempts at melodrama. Really horrible stuff!         The fact is, the movie is too boring to sit through. Perhaps we were bored because we had been spoiled by the movie we knew so well. We tried to get through it, but finally gave up moved on to Trading Spaces or some cooking show.
B00000AFGM|4.0|PUT THE CD INTO THE COMPUTER.YOU WILL SEE ARTWORK AND A CONTINUING LOOP OF SPOKEN WORD AND MUSIC
B000127LW2|5.0|Star Trek Voyager is easily one of the finest ST series ever made. In between the end of the Next Generation and in the middle of Deep Space Nine, Rick Berman and company decided to go for another series.    They really didn't know what they wanted initially other than they wanted to make it different than the other ST series (this on the Special Features on Disc 5). However borrowing on the environment of the Next Generation they decided to make another program based on the experience of a crew aboard a starship. The major plot of the show is that they were trying to get back home after being pushed several thousands of light years away.    The DVD box set by Paramount is simply superb!!! They did NOT dropped the ball on anything at all. The case is wonderfully animated with the picture of the ship.  The case is very small and compact. The DVD's look like they were restored and the Special Features on the disc are enough to keep any Trekkie happy.    Of course my favorites episode would be \\"Caretaker\\" , \\"Phage\\" which introduces the organ stealing Vidiians, \\"Ex Post Facto\\" which had a slice of a murder mystery feeling to it, \\"Heroes and Demons\\", and \\"Cathexis\\" to name a few.    The chemistry between the actors was great and everyone seems to have a favorite mine was Jenway , Tom Paris, and B'Elanna. Examining the stories too they ain't just about aliens like another good Star Trek show there are moral and ethical dilemmas that are presented.    Most people who don't buy the DVD set won't realize that Kate Mulgrew was actually not the first choice to be the Captain it was a French actress named Bujold. Bujold was a fine actress but really too old for the part and she has no energy whatsoever.    The Special Features go into detail including a feature on Kate's preparation for the role by studying Patrick Stewart's performing of Luc Picard in the TNG.    As for the bellyaching that the sets are too expensive apparently no one has heard of Ebay? LMAO Anyhow this is a great set to own so buy them now.
B00006FRO5|5.0|This is important, If you order the one titled: <br /> <br />Is This It (Bonus DVD) (Special Limited Edition) [ENHANCED] [LIMITED EDITION] <br /> <br />YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!! I'm sure it's a great cd but you have to order it from the amazon stores by people that are very unreliable. <br />I had ordered it because I liked the artwork on it more than the [UK] version. Its the exact same CD!! I had baught the U.S. one from a place called <br />\\"woody's books\\" <br />and \\"vdowarehouse\\" <br />here off amazon and they never came. <br />YOU MUST BUY DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.com (way safer) Thats why this one is a good choice, once I had ordered it from here (amazon.com) it had came earlier than the 4-6 weeks. It came in 3 days! <br />Besides who cares about the artwork, ignore the controversy (all it is is a naked girl with a black glove. WHO CARES!!) Now that I own it I have changed my mind and noticed the artwork is really good on this cd. The best artwork on any of their cds in my opinion! <br />Anyways it's the music that counts. Which is exactly the same as the U.S. version. <br />Plus aside from the three videos that are on it's included dvd there are two never aired shows on there that I'm not sure if the U.S. version has.
B00003CWRX|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, despite its exaggerations and melodramatic touches. Pacino and Crowe give fine performances, and the glimpse we get into the world of big tobacco companies and highly-paid journalists is fascinating. Unfortunately, there are numerous slow patches throughout this 2.5 hour movie. They could have cut about 20 minutes without losing anything important, and the result would have been more watchable. With that qualifier, I'd recommend \\"The Insider\\" to anyone who enjoys dramatic pseudo-documentary movies.
0743424425|2.0|THE SHINING-----2 STARS    I dont understand, how people say that this book is a classic. I just finished this book and i am happy its over. This book is about 450 pages (hardcover) and the first 350 pages are so boring, that it was torture. Nothnig happens in this book!!!!  Its is FAR from scary....the book does heat up a little bit, at around the 350 page mark, but just when it starts to get good, its over!!!  ALOT of questions that the reader has, go un-answered...King could have went on at least , for another 200 pages, to make the ending worth the boring begining, and the boring middle......The only thing i liked about this book, was how smooth the transition went with Jack Torrence, going from loving caring husband, and father, to a completley possesed killer. I have just recently begun my quest for reading EVERY book in the King library, i have EVERY book of his brand new and in hardcover....i have read, (see my reviews) CELL, DREAMCATCHER, DESPERATION, MISERY, IT,....and now, THE SHINING, ....The Shining is bay FAR one of the worst books of his i have read, i even think that THE CELL was better...On a scale of 1-10 i give this book a 6    I am currently reading THE TOMMYKNOCKERS, so look for that review shortly
1400079179|5.0|The book was well worth the read, everyone feels that it gets a lot more hype then it should, well of course it does, the religious world doesn't want anyone to be aware of it's secrets.  There is a ton of mystery in the book backed up by a great deal of interesting facts.  I enjoyed the book and found the movie to be worth the 2hrs 40min, wonderful job, well done.
B00005JOQS|3.0|When you are a big fan of the Superman character, you want `them' to get it right, especially knowing the new movie has been in infamous development hell for 19 years. You want to get excited while you're watching it and have your expectations met and be surprised by some new, interesting `2006' interpretation on it. You want to give it 5 stars.    Whilst the film had some scenes were you felt you were getting a cinematic rush, aided by the repeat of the emotive, classic music score, I came out of the film with mixed feelings...just another Hollywood `3 star' blockbuster with a lot of attention to detail, a lot of money thrown at it for CGI effects but for all the time and money spent on development, the golden rule should still be that you're only as good as your script/storyline. The scriptwriters, Dan Harris (27) and Michael Dougherty (??) are very young and perhaps lack life experience when writing about matters of the heart. Perhaps Bryan Singer lacks Richard Donner's life experience when directing actors to emote. The script lacked smart, original, inspired dialogue and reeked of being worked over and over, conscious not to offend, conscious to get a PG rating (it got an `M' here anyway), conscious of marketing tie ins, conscious of it's global success potential (`truth, justice and all that stuff'). You could feel the interference from Warner Bros executives trying to justify their salaries as you were watching it. \\"You can't have a boy or his mother (Lois) or her defacto screaming as they are potentially about to drown\\". \\"You can't have people on a plane about to go down, scream or look terrified. It might offend or scare children. \\"Keep it PG.\\" When you find yourself mentally rewriting the dialogue from your cinema seat, wishing that the Aussie extras in the crowd scenes were not mute and yelled out more...\\"go Superman! We love you!\\" then it becomes frustrating to watch. Not sure if the budget was too tight to get the extras to speak or emote or if there was an actors equity problem, but the strange silence in crowd scenes (& in the Daily Planet news room) zapped the energy from the film when it should have been more exciting. Especially a film that professes to be so character driven and emotive. For this reason, shooting in Australia (in spite of the dollar stretching the effects budget further), worked against it for the feel of the film...it needed a New York/Metropolis sensibility if it was truly trying to tie in and be a sequel to parts 1 and 2. It needed American extras. It needed to be made there.    Brandon Routh's stoic, cinematic performance as Superman is the best thing about the movie. That he could say so little and hold so much emotion in his eyes, you actually care that he feels alone in the world. It was a performance like a throw back to the old era of charismatic actors. Facial expressions and the eyes speak louder than words (especially when the words the actors have to speak aren't that interesting). He's a worthy successor to Chris Reeve's portrayal.    Except for Routh, the performances were generally flat and lacklustre - lacking enthusiasm and energy. Kate Bosworth, who admitted to consciously not studying Kidder and previous actresses who have played Lois Lane, gave such an un-Lois like performance. Gone was the feistiness and steely resolve. She said she studied Kate Hepburn instead but I couldn't see that either. She played it too nice and victimy. Lois is nobody's victim. Perhaps it is hard to get great performances with actors concerned with hitting their marks with blue screens in backgrounds and CGI to worry about, but the responsibility lies with Bryan Singer who should have extracted more animated and `alive' performances (from Spacey as well). Casting too young (obviously, knowing the actors will get older with sequels in mind), didn't help to believe the love story or triangle or that 5 years could have elapsed since his return - I didn't buy it that this version Lois & Superman hadhistory or were still in love, I didn't buy Kitty's tears (Parker Posey) when Superman was being tortured by Luthor and his henchmen. I didn't care that Luthor's motivation was that he was angry having done another jail term and wanting more real estate (again) like in Parts 1 & 2. There are so many villains in Superman mythology to choose from, give Lex a rest, surely it's been done as has weakening Superman's strength with Kryptonite. This is where Batman (& now Spiderman) has always done it better: new film = new villain, keep it fresh and don't repeat yourself. If General Zod was to reappear in the next sequel, then we know there's a nervous`ideas' block with the creators to think of something fresh, nervous to do something untried and unfortunately revert to something already done because it has worked before (Part 2).   These kinds of films with these kinds of budgets seem to be created and approved by committee and not a visionary creative with the license to create the film he/she wants. For this reason, these types of films are sometimes good but rarely great because they are devoid of taking risks. Everything is so researched to death, everything created with marketing in mind to make as much money as possible. I understand it's a business, but don't try to be a great film (the visual & mystical comparisons to Jesus Christ were a bit `try hard'). If the same team is entrusted again on the next sequel, lighten up on the next one, don't over labour it, have more fun with it and make the actors work for their money. The actors looked startled at times (especially the child playing Lois's son).    The noticeably smaller `s' shield on the suit was just another distraction while trying to enjoy the movie - more Superboy-ish in proportion than Superman-ish (not helped that Routh is only 26). The shield could do with a tweak on the next instalment to scale it back up a notch.    The film felt like it was afraid to take off for fear of all the boxes not being ticked to please everyone which is a shame because it couldn't have been so much more had all the actors (& extras) fired up.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If you're stuck in by yourself one night, and just fancy taking your mind off things for a bit, order a pizza, crack open a bottle of beer, and check out V for Vendetta. I missed this at the cinema, but it's a perfect night in.<br /><br />Set in a nightmare future where an ultra-right wing government has come to power, V for Vendetta mixes a fantastic story with state-of-the-art special effects. Natalie Portman is Evie, an orphan whose life is turned around when she is saved one night by the mysterious \\"V\\", a vigilante who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and whose aim is the same as the original Guy Fawkes - the destruction of Parliament! And his agenda: revolution! At first horrified, Evie soon has to make a decision - to trust this mysterious masked man, or the government that oppresses the country every day! Who are the real terrorists - individuals who protest, or the government itself? Who is the mysterious V? What is the secret of his shadowy past?<br /><br />This film asks many questions of us - and so you feel you are an integral part in the story, touching as it does on issues such as war, bigotry and racial hatred, as V appeals to the British public to consider their own actions.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a rare movie - an action-packed, but thoughtful film that makes you think about the state of the world today and the direction we're headed in. With brilliant performances from Portman, Hugo Weaving, and John Hurt, V for Vendetta not only  makes for a perfect night in, it also makes you want to get out and start making a difference - unlike some long and extremely dull books my girlfriend keeps insisting we read about generations of families in South America or people messing about in the Ukraine looking for lost pensioners.<br /><br />This is a film that will get you thinking - and keep you thinking.
B000F7CMRW|2.0|I found this film rather boring. It was too complicated and too long. Most of the time I wasn't even sure of what was going on. I have seen Geroge Clooney in much better films.
B000F5GNX8|2.0|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, is one of those films that leaves you wondering if there were \\"production problems.\\" The cast is good (Val Kilmer, Robert Downey Jr., and Michelle Monaghan), and there is genuine chemistry between the three.  But the story is something else.  It's a mess, and has you thinking this might be a cut and paste effort at comic noir from a 5 year old, except 5 year olds don't think (hopefully) about such things as severed fingers and corpses in showers - and more importantly, they still retain a sense of wonder that invests whatever they do. In contrast, KK, BB, is as stale a cut and paste effort as you will find.  Even the \\"funny\\" moments seem tired and familiar.  If you were to sit down and watch \\"Fargo\\", or \\"The Ice Harvest\\", and then try and watch KK, BB, I doubt you could even finish watching it - the movie is that embarrassing.  One thing about noir, even if the story doesn't make sense, the fallback is Style.  And again, KK, BB, falls short.  Yeah, it takes place in LA, and you get to see the inevitable party scene, but it goes nowhere.  Gunfire, bodies here and there, a car chase, a goofy bed time scene, a whiff of incest that is delivered in the most ho-hum way.  Wet noodles from Sin City.  Two stars for the acting trio trying to stay afloat in a story that never really meshes.
B00004WG2F|4.0|Legends of the Fall is an epic family-based story set in a gorgeous landscape - the untamed lands of Montana in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Like most of these sweeping stories, it is about beautiful people and torrential passion. You don't watch these for a lot of sensical plotline and in depth dialogue. You watch for the soap-opera highs, lows and beautiful faces.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and his long hair are the key here. He is the oldest son - the most beloved son - out of three. He is pretty much raised by an \\"Indian Chief\\" who is a good friend of father Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins had been a soldier in the Indian Wars, had been sickened by what happened, and retreated to Montana to raise his family. Rounding out the family is a servant couple - a native american woman, her American husband, and their half-breed daughter.<br /><br />There are interesting commentaries on the Indian situation here. A pub owner refuses to serve to the chief because of his race. The servants won't send their daughter to the local school because they're worried she'd be picked on. On the other hand, the Chief is portrayed as an \\"all wise\\" character - one who trains Pitt to kill everything in sight and to scalp people. It made me a bit uncomfortable.<br /><br />But again, this isn't a movie about gripping accuracy. It's about epicness. There are thundering, rich musical interludes, and truly stunning scenery. The actors NEVER seem to age throughout the entire story. They are always young and beautiful.<br /><br />Women aren't treated very well by this film. There's the mom who takes off on her family without any regret. There's the \\"half breed\\" who is only 20 when Pitt takes her for his wife, in a move bordering on incest given how they grew up together. That's how these stories go, of course. You've got the abandoning cold one, the innocent sweet killed-too-soon one - and then of course the third \\"stereotype\\" - the passionate woman that everybody wants.<br /><br />That would be Julia Ormand. Julia falls for the youngest son first - played by Henry Thomas. When she shows up in Montana with him, the other 2 sons fall for her as well. She is lured by Pitt's manliness but dutifully restrains herself. In no time at all Thomas is running off to join in WWI, and his 2 brothers go along to protect him. Julie pleads with Pitt to protect her fiance. Unfortunately, Thomas dies rather quickly, and Pitt feels like it is his fault.<br /><br />So now you begin the real epicosity of the story. Aidan Quinn - the middle son - reveals his love for widow Julia. She rebuffs him, pining for Pitt. Pitt makes love to Julia and Quinn is jealous. Quinn takes off, Pitt hangs out for a while - long enough for Julia to become completely in love with him - then takes off for years and years. Julia pines and cries. Finally Julia gives in to Quinn rather than be alone. Then of course this is Pitt's cue to return and to take up with the now-barely-20 almost-a-sister. In a short period of time the new wife is killed because of Pitt's rum-running, Julia commits suicide rather than be away from him, and the remaining family (all men except the lone Indian woman) settles down again.<br /><br />I really love the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful actors - but I guess I just like \\"realism\\" too much to have fully appreciated the epic-cicity of this. Julia cries and cries and cries. She starts out as an intelligent, athletic woman who can handle horses - but ends up petulant and weak. No other female in the cast even has a chance. Quinn is great as the middle son who does his extreme best and is never respected for it, or given love. Thomas doesn't have much to work with in being the \\"sweet innocent protected idealistic youngest son\\" who is killed off in short order.<br /><br />Then there's Pitt. His main job is to look handsome and manly. He breaks wild horses. He wrangles the herd. He watches out for his younger brother. He fights with a bear. The women all adore him. He breaks downand sobs at his brother's death. This melts the heart of all female watchers :). A cowboy who can handle the rough mustangs! The soldier who can shoot straight! The man who can cry when he's sad! Plus the looks! He's set out to be a God.<br /><br />The ironic part is that Pitt mistreats the women he comes across - and yet because of the above qualities it's considered \\"OK\\" - just as when soap opera guys mistreat their women it's excused because \\"well men will be men\\". He hates his mom for leaving them even while his brothers accept it. He is fond of Julia - but once he has her firmly in love with him, he abandons her because he wants to be wild and free. He refuses to write to her, and when he finally does he is callous. When he comes back, he quickly climbs into the arms of the servant girl who has been pretty much a sister to him his whole life - something to me akin to a teacher agreeing to a student's embraces. He deliberately engages in risky gun-running which endangers his family, and she dies as a result. His treatment of Julia drives her to suicide. And yet somehow he emerges as the hero of the story.<br /><br />So while I really appreciated where this story was going, and that it was meant to be full of epicness, I didn't like much at all how it treated women - or native Americans. Both were used as extreme stereotypes. The gorgeous landscapes and gorgeous actors could have created an amazingly meaningful story - but what we got didn't quite measure up to that potential.and sobs at his brother's death.

B00005JP01|4.0|After I have seen and heard awful reviews, this movie was quite a surprised to me.  Sure it does not feature Paul Walker or Vin Disel!?  Lucas Black did a good job filled in to the main role.  As we all know, Street racing and customized street car with unique painting originated in Japan, and I thought it was brilliant idea that this movie took a place in Japan.  Sure it has a quite a few flows as American kid never ended up going to Japanese traditional public school.  And Lucas Black's military dad never had to live in that pig stay.  They do have a nice western houses for them to live either on base or near base, but never lived downtown area where 30 miles off from base...<br />The drive sequels are great as first two movies in different way.  It was such a treat to see them on street of Tokyo.  And Those unknown Asian actors contributed quite a depth of characters to make this eyecady/popcorn movie more realistic.  It still amazes me that The Fast and Furious movies always have been meant to guilty pleasure/pop corn movies, but it always has great and strong character developments and cultural portraits.
0060751967|5.0|For the longest time, I allowed the title of this book to prevent me from reading the book. \\"How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire?\\" How clich&eacute;, I thought. But, I was wrong in my pre-judgment. Don't make the same mistake I did; don't judge by the title. If I had just ignored my first instinct, I would have had the opportunity to enjoy this wonderful book a lot sooner.<br /><br />Roman is a rarity among vampires; he doesn't believe in \\"biting.\\" As a scientist, it is Roman's mission to invent products that would control a vampire's natural desire to bite and feed. While testing one of his products, something goes wrong and he loses a fang.<br /><br />One fang short, Roman seeks out Shanna, a reluctant dentist, for help. But, he wasn't the only one who needed Shanna; the Russian mob was just killing to get their hands on her. Against his better judgment, Roman brings Shanna to his home in order to protect her - thus angering the Russian Coven Master/Hit man, Ivan Petrovsky. Shanna must learn to trust Roman in order to survive; because without him she could not possibly defeat Ivan.<br /><br />The author's characterizations reminded me of some of Julie Garwood's historical novels. It's hard not to fall in love with these heroic characters. Each character in \\"How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire,\\" including Shanna, has an old-world feel to them.<br /><br />I'm not particular fond of violence in Romance novels, but this book contains the perfect balance of romance, comedy, and action. There is a certain lightness to the story; and quite frankly, I consumed this book as one would a cream puff - quickly and without hesitation. Ah, sweet and satisfying!<br /><br />This book is a sure thing - a great buy; it's a story that can be read over and over again.
0679731725|5.0|The beauty of Ishiguro's writing is hard to get right the first time when, let's say, you are trying to describe it to someone you really like, and have taken her out to dinner. To finish the job, you'll need to throw a wine and anthrax party simply to do justice to his use of language alone. All authors weave a carpet, and some authors manage to turn that into a magical one and deliver you into pure flights of fantasy. This one does both. Remains of the day is like a finely tailored suit from Saville row. The finest of the fine. Brave, honest, tragic, tearful of lost opportunities and bygone days, how loyalty to ethics can cloud Ethics itself. After I read this, i picked everyone of his novels to read. They are spellbinding
1932100660|5.0|This book is surprisingly readable.  The authors took 30 years of research and made it into a story of discovery about nutrition.  It is an amazing book that everyone should read.  I've purchased several copies for friends.  We have changed what we eat based on what we learned in this book and have never felt better.  I can't recommend it enough.

What was it like, he asked, for those natives who cut down the last tree? Does Diamond really care? This book is for people who hate their neighbors, who supposedly hate materialism, and probably run around with ipods in their ears. I will nominate it for my annual Snooze-Book of the Year Award.
1401200923|5.0|Excellent reading and great artwork by Jim Lee. What more could you ask for. I highly recommend this for collectors or avid readers. I purchased this item so I wouldn't have to re-read my comic book version.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Truly a masterpiece.  This DVD belongs in every collection.  The extended edition has some additional scenes which were not in the original release.  Worth a little extra money.
0385336691|5.0|Once again Lee Child has deprived me of a good nights sleep.  Started this book at 8pm and didn't put it down until 4am. <br /> <br />Many authors, after ten books with the same main character, tend to get a little sloppy in their plots.  Not the case with Mr. Child.  THE HARD WAY is every bit as good as THE KILLING FLOOR (the first featuring Reacher.)  This book moves along and doesn't get bogged down in useless details.  Child develops the characters well and keeps the book moving.  There are enough twists to the plot to keep the reader interested. <br /> <br />As an aside, for those who like Jack Reacher, I would also recommend F.Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack series.  Repairman Jack is another protagonist who flys under the radar, so to speak.  The big difference is the bad guys in Wilson's novels are sometimes from the \\"dark side\\".  Try one of Wilson's books, I think you will like it. <br /> <br />
B000EMGJM2|4.0|Anyone who is expecting pure R&B will be sorely disappointed.  Take a little bit of Hendrix, Prince, Steely Dan, Sly, and a random 80's band---that might get you a taste of Van Hunt. I loved his first CD and I love this one even more. It's important to note that there is not a single musical theme on this CD so if you can't stand a little of rock, a little bit of funk, and a little bit of soul, you'll end up irked.  My favorites for Neo-Soul: Priest or Police, FUNK: Hot Stage Lights, ROCK: Ride, Ride, Ride.<br /><br />For some odd reason, my absolute favorite is the The End of a Slow Dance...perhaps its my nostalgia for the 80's. ENJOY!
B00004RF8J|5.0|Rick Moranis is adoreable, Steve Martin is appropriately sleazy, and Ellen Greene is a most unlikely heroine.  Taken as a whole, this movie is wonderful...charming even.  A definite must have for anyone who enjoys all things quirky but sweet.

Yeah, so what, we've all read the rants on Aint It cool.  I'm tired of the disgruntled fan boy mimicry and whining.  <br />I look forward to being able to finally add these to my SW collection.  To be able to plug some authentic releases in and sit back and get nostalgic.  To watch it with out my child hood memories being interupted by injected \\"continuity\\".  All i can say is the bloopers better still be there ;) <br />HAN SHOOTS FIRST!
B00005JOWF|1.0|The only redeeming feature of this flick are the special effects and costuming!<br /><br />The rest of this movie sucked. The acting was bad, monotone, and one dimensional..... No depth of character.<br /><br />The fight scenes were badly choreographed, phony looking and fake. Too many of the fight scenes in \\"Ultraviolet\\" were poorly reminscent of \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Aeon Flux\\", and made this movie feel like a shoddy imitation in comparison. Both \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Aeon Flux\\" were far superior movies in in terms of plot, acting, special effects, fight sequences and more.<br /><br />Ending of this movie wasn't great either, nor very creative. Found it difficult to want to watch this movie through it's end result.<br /><br />Don't waste money or time renting or buying this movies!

1563899426|2.0|100 Bullets had me very interested in the Vertigo comic series, that coupled with the fact the cover had quite nice art. Once I got in I found the concept to be pretty sound: Fairy tales characters all lived in a giant kingdom that was conquered so now they live in modern day new york. All the characters were there too... but despite all this Willingham decides to mess with original stories a bit to make things more interesting I suppose. That set me off from the begining. <br /> <br />I read on, hoping the end would justify the means. However, by the end of the book I felt all the characters were rather shallow, casting aside the myth behind them was fine, but not much work was done to build up the new characters beyond paper-cutter archetypes. I will try the second volume, but my hopes for this series have been violently dashed against the rocks.
006056251X|5.0|Evie, a redhead without a temper, is the most enigmatic of the wallflowers. She is shy, struggles with self-esteem, is generally overlooked, and yet has the most grit of the four Wallflowers. She is also desperate to get away from her physically and emotionally abusive guardians and to her father's side, the only man who ever loved her, before he passes away from consumption. <br />St. Vincent, a rake without means or apparent morality is her perfect match. And he is just desperate enough to take her offer after botching an attempt to seduce and then an attempt to kidnap Lillian from the previous book. <br />Evie's condition is that once he has provided her with his name legally and delivered her to her father's side, they may go their separate ways and he may collect her dowry and inheritance and return to his lifestyle. An easy deal surely. <br />Unfortunately for St. Vincent, once he notices her he can't seem to get enough but how can he win her trust and her love when he's everyone's favorite villain? <br />This story is as much about trust as love. Yes, its full of romantic cliches but endearing nonetheless. The main characters don't just fall in love, they also mature. The side character of Cam Rohan, half gypsy and half Irish, is so intriguing I hope Lisa tells more of his story in a future novel. I was very dissappointed that he doesn't seem to be the romantic lead of the next novel.
0393035158|1.0|Harris makes many points in his book, primarily how extremism in religion (he singles out Islam in one chapter) is divisive and incompatible with reason and rationality.  I agree with that, but I don't agree that all religions are incompatible with rationality or reasonable thinking.<br /><br />And therein lies the problem with Harris's book.  He assumes that because some religions promote terrorism, then all religions must do the same.  This is a logical fallacy (the fallacy of division).  So what we have is a book ostensibly about reason being based on a logical fallacy.<br /><br />Oops.<br /><br />Harris makes the same mistake that Carl Sagan did in \\"The Demon-Haunted World.\\"  He states that if you accept a literal translation of the Bible as true, then the Earth must be flat.<br /><br />Read Isaiah 40:22:  \\"There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the Earth.\\"  Try reading the book you are trying to discredit first, and save some of your credibility in the process.

1400079179|1.0|I'd heard very mixed reviews about this book but on the most part it had sounded interesting so I wanted to read it for myself.<br /><br />Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is a powerful contestant for the worst book I've read. From the beginning of the book, I was underwhelmed by the writing style (if you can even call it that) and the characters, I found, were surprisingly unimpressionable. For example, one of the protagonists was Robert Langdon, supposedly Professor of Religious Symbology, Harvard University, yet it took him such an EfFoRt to even begin to \\"decipher\\" the simplest \\"codes\\" along the way. For such an intelligent academic professional, he appears quite stupid. Despite the book's bad points, I had to finish reading it just to say that I had read it. I also wanted to see if there was a chance the story picked up towards the end.<br /><br />This did not happen. The book spiralled from the beginning further and further into the realms of unreadability.<br /><br />Granted, the idea behind the book was interesting. It certainly had potential. But Brown killed all this potential with the underdeveloped characters, perforated storyline and bad writing.<br /><br />On page 13, \\"It is almost too easy.\\" sums up the book. Again, on page 421, we read: \\"Arranging the fatal meeting between Sauni&egrave;re and Silas had been almost too easy.\\"<br /><br />The fact is that it IS too easy. Everything is too convenient, too linear to require any kind of thinking. It is a Mystery how it is a bestseller, never mind staying stubbornly in no.1 for so long.<br /><br />\\"Deceiving the stupid multitude\\" (page 231) is something Dan Brown has achieved with this book through marketing; not through good writing, talent or intelligence.
6305313687|5.0|As always Norton delivers.  Entertaining, graphic, emotional.  Interesting to note how the people who gave this film one star are calling the people who gave it a more favorable review morons and simpletons.  Oh the irony.
B0000026UV|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD.  Haven't had a great deal to do with the mucic of Chet Atkins before, but certainly knew of him. <br />The music is easy to listen to and sing along with once you know the words - if you listen to it often enough, and I seem to be doing just that. <br />Am glad I made the purchase. <br />Ros Campbell
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Aeon Flux sheds light on the last human city following a virus that nearly killed off humankind 400 years earlier.  Having been in the hands of the Goodchild dynasty for centuries, the city of Bregna is slipping out of control as insurgents use assassins to kill off the settlement's leadership.  One lone assassin, however, will discover something that will shake the very foundations of society more than any mere assassination...   <br />There are strong hints of the Matrix and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category. <br />Charlize Theron (who is GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well. <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful! <br />Though not a masterpiece, Aeon Flux will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!  <br />
067144901X|5.0|Good friends of our family just had twins and my wife and I were discussing what to give as a gift. We talked about clothes. We talked about diapers. We talked about board books.<br /><br />Suddenly my wife called our 8 yr. old son into the room and then started rummaging around in a file cabinet. She pulled out a file folder of keepsakes from his earliest years. In between the drawings and crafts and pictures was the gnawed on cover of Moo, Baa, La, La, La.<br /><br />We both had spent countless hours reading to our son and this was one of his, and our, favorite children's books. Even today with little effort we were able to recite the whole book. We laughed and laughed at the wonderful memories.<br /><br />I highly recommend you get a copy of Moo, Baa, La, La, La and create your own laugh filled memories for you and your favorite child.<br /><br />Kevin Decker

0140067477|5.0|\\"The Tao of Pooh\\" is a good book as an introduction to Taoism. The book does not only present Taoism in a very simple way; the involvement of Pooh makes the book very enjoying. <br /> <br />I was afraid that this book will assume some knowledge about Pooh, which I have only watched a handful of time - a couple of years ago. Thankfully the book only uses characters of Pooh to present the ideas, rather than make this another Pooh story.
B000GFRDN6|3.0|Fans of the album expecting to hear the groovy 'Space Intro' in surround -- e.g., me-- are in for a disappointment-- it's not there.  It was also omitted on the earlier DTS suround disc. To me, this is like omitting 'Speak to Me' from 'Dark Side of the Moon'.    Weirdly,one of the documentaries on the DVD *does* start with a bit of the Space Intro-- in surround.    The CD remaster has it all of course,but of course that's also been given the 'everything louder than everything else' modern dynamics reduction treatment, common in remasters nowadays, so that you can hear it all in your car or when you're listening via your ipod.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|On the surface, this film is about an American Jew (Elijah Wood) who goes to present-day Ukraine to look for some ancestral roots, and the Ukrainian family (mainly a post-pubescent kid, his seemingly half-deranged grandfather and similarly deranged dog) who helps him on his quest.<br /><br />Watching the film you see that there are some dark secrets both personal and national at play, as well as the theme of loss and recovery, the past as key to the present, etc.  These themes are not fully fleshed out but mostly just hinted at and glossed over (the book probably delves into them more fully) but nonetheless what this film provides is a refreshing look at a very different, and in some ways more interesting and vital culture than the usual McHollywood junk.<br /><br />Lots of offbeat humor, a distinctly Eastern European sensibility somewhere between nihilism and naivete with lots of bittersweet humor in between, a hefty dose of Slavic beautiful-sadness aesthetic, and lots of things left mostly unexplained.  The music and cinematography are a real treat, this film is a feast for the eyes, heart, and mind.

B00009RDGA|5.0|I have only seen this heartfelt movie once but I am sure to purchase Paper Moon as soon as I can. I love Tatum O'Neal, she earned a best supporting actress oscar at ten (the youngest to win). Ryan O'Neal is great too even though I don't respect the guy too much off-camera but Paper Moon is a timeless tale of a little orphaned girl who believes the man she traveling with is really her father. Who knows if he really is but Paper Moon is a landmark in filmmaking, excellent direction by Peter Bogdanovich. Paper Moon is filmed in black and white, perfect for the time this movie is set in. I highly recommend this gem of a film.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Don't ask what this film is about. Plotlines twist and change like the winding mountain road of the title. Who is after beautiful Camilla, and will she regain the memory she lost in a car crash? Will bright newcomer Diana make it in the movies? Who are the mysterious men (including an apparent mastermind in a wheelchair) behind her unlikely rise to stardom? Who's the skanky guy who lives behind the restaurant. Why are the plot and delivery so stilted? What is the mysterious blue box?<br /><br />David Lynch has put together a movie that can't always be followed but is always fascinating to watch. Characters, settings and objects surface again and again but in new and illuminating contexts. The level of suspense is incredibly high, and the degree of deliberate artifice just adds to the overall weirdness if the film.<br /><br />Nothing special about the DVD unless you want to watch the very misleading theatrical trailer. The film has no chapter divisions, so don't make the mistake (as I did) of turning it off partway through. You'll have to fast-forward through the entire film to regain your place!<br /><br />A wild and wonderful picture, with excellent performances by Naomi Watts, Laura Harring and Justin Theroux. A couple of topless scenes and a sprinkling of f-bombs make this inappropriate for young teen viewers, but the \\"R\\" is mostly for overall spookiness and high tension. \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is exhausting -- a work of great craft, perhaps genius -- which is not to say I am anxious to watch it again.
0783222149|5.0|Have seen this movie many times - it only gets better.  Suspenseful and engaging, it will keep you guessing, and it's good to see Kevin Bacon as a bad guy for a change.  Well-acted by Meryl Streep and Kevin, this is great for a rainy Saturday!
0767802659|3.0|Unlike the book, Starship Troopers the movie is leaning towards the action-sequences of the \\"Starship Troopers universe\\" instead of the overall message of fascism and government. <br /> <br />And at that, the action sequences are great. Even with cheesey, cookie-cutter characters, and card-board cut-out soldiers sprinkled about to die in horrible ways, the action is intense. The bugs are very well animated -- in fact, the CGI in this movie is probably the best ever to grace the big/T.V. screen, and it's nearing 10-years of age! The CGI is just very accurate, and even when scrutinized it's hard to pick up on any sort of faulty details -- everything is picked up on and I applaud those who helped with the special effects in this movie. <br /> <br />Bar the action, however, the movie is pretty tame. Again, the characters are weak and don't hold up well when there aren't guns in their hands and bugs to shoot at. The government messages are entertaining and funny, but really don't get any more indepth then that. <br /> <br />Overall, get it as a pop-corn flick. Just don't bring out your monocle and look for anything deep.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon was a film I seriously never heard about until I took a film class at my College a few years back. Boy was I surprised how well this popular movie was shot, the camera trickery through the woods is spectacular, I love how the sun blazes and blinds the camera in certain shots. There are five different points of view throughtout the film and I think the last take on what really happened to the young married couple is the probably the truth and the best story of Rashomon. Of course this film is foreign so don't forget to set the subtitles on your DVD player.  A fabulous and etertaining DVD, don't skip this one. Enjoy!
B00004X01U|3.0|this album reminds me of bedtime stories in that it never flowed well, too many different styles of music, theres a mixture of mediocre songs with incredible ones. <br />1. music 3/5-never new why this song caught on so much, bad lyrics, ok beats , not one of my fav hits. <br />2.impressive instant 5/5-love this electronic song., very spce age <br />3.runaway lover 3/5-ok dance song, nothing special <br />4.i deserve it 5/5 -great ballad, heartfelt lyrics. <br />5.amazing 3/5 -another ok dance song, sounded too much like \\"beautiful stranger\\" <br />6.nobodys perfect 1/5-always hated this song, was even worse on tour.ranks up ther with 'ashanti\\" <br />7.dont tell me 5/5-one of my favs, awesome video, awesome song. <br />8.what it feels like for a girl 4/5-good lyrics, nice cool beats <br />9.paradise (but not for me)-5/5-didnt care for it at first until i saw the drowned world tour and now confessions tour blew this song away! cant stop listening to it. <br />10.gone 3/5-decent song
B00005JOQS|5.0|I won't go into the topic of the movie because I think other AOL fans have already described the movie perfectly.  When I first watch this movie, I was leary of new comer Brandon after all he was being replaced by Christopher Reeves.  I remember this feeling when Star Trek Next Generation came out and I felt Capt. Kirk was being replaced by Picard.  With that said, the transition from Chris to Brandon was easy.  Brandon is the perfect Superman taking on the traits that Reeves brought to the character and brought his own interputation to Superman.  Even though Superman 3 and 4 were campy, I still enjoyed these movies and I like the fact that director Singer brought a seriousness to the franchise and choose to ignore 3 and 4.  One of the key points I like about the this remake is the theme was in tact which makes a Superman movie like the theme to Star Wars makes a Star Wars movie.  There were a lot of references to the first Superman and second Superman movie and even you get a glimpse of Superman holding up a car and you saw the first cover of the Superman comic book.  In all, go see this movie, I promised you will not be disappointed.  You will laugh, cheer, and may-be even sob a little by the tense scenes.<br /><br />Superman Returns is the best Superman movie ever!!  I love this movie so much, I have already seen it 3 times, brought the paperback and the soundtrack.  I can't wait till the sequels and when this movie is released out on DVD!  Thank you Bryan Singer, you are my hero for bringing classic superhero movies such as X-Men and Superman back to the screen!
B000002IHU|5.0|This to me is Ratt at their very best, I cant find one bad song on here, all of them are good. The songs that desearve a lot of attention are 'Your In Love', Lay It Down', and 'What You Give Is What You Get'. It is worth all the money, so get this one as soon as possible, you'll be glad you did.

This book is worth every penny and more.<br /><br />For anyone who ever wants to write anything, be it novels, manuals, or eloquent emails, get this book. It will change the way you write forever.

0671027387|3.0|the Search for Extraterrestrial Invertebrates.  This is the central plot line of Dan Brown's erzatz thriller, Deception Point.  It is also an apt description of the characterization.<br /><br />The book was apparently motivated by the 1996 scientific scandal in which the Administration announced evidence of life in a Martian meteorite.  No way Al Gore could be so dumb.  It must have been a conspiracy.<br /><br />Deception Point disappoints on virtually every level.  The triple-crossing plot is tangled, but not intricate.  The prose and dialog are dull.  Science-fiction elements turn up as convenient gimmicks.  The government agencies and officials don't even pretend to obey the rules and constraints of their actual namesakes.  However, there's no problem with plot resolution:  the master of secrecy suffers the usual compulsion to explain all to his victims.<br /><br />As for originality and excitement, get ready for a thrilling conclusion copied directly from (I kid you not) The Little Mermaid.
B000002NJS|4.0|i else can be said about ray of light, it was her comeback album, beautifully written with amazing sounds. with the exception of 2-3 songs it would be 5 stars. \\"confessions\\" beats it by a hair  <br />1.drowned world 5/5-beautiful <br />2.swim 5/5-ditto <br />3.ray of light 5/5-the best madonna song --ever!!! <br />4.candy perfume girl 2/5- never really cared for this, on tour was better  <br />5.skin 2.5/5-never really took hold of me, no emotion <br />6 nothing really matters 5/5-LOVE this song, cant get enough of it. <br />7.sky fits heaven 4/5-great road song <br />8.shanti/ashangi- 1/5-think i spelled it right??, hated this song always have , has so feeling of beat \\"isaac\\" is much better !! <br />9. frozen 5/5- next great madonna song, a classic <br />10. to have not to hold 5/5- love this one, sweet touching, true to life. <br />11.power of goodbye 5/5-another hit, also true to life <br />12.little star 4/5- loved her perform it on \\"oprah\\", lourdes's song. <br />13. mer girl 4/5-cool song, more of a fable instead of a song. <br />if you dont own this cd, you should , its a classic!!! <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|This has to be my personal favorite Maiden album! I would play it non-stop when i first bought it from the record store and memorized all the songs. The album opens with the hit \\"Aces High,\\" it has a spine chilling solo in my opinion. The album fowards to \\"2 Minutes To Midnight,\\" a long but truly amazing song. \\"Losfer Words; Big 'Orra\\" is an instrumental song with great musicianship. Dave Murray and Adrian Smith's dual guitars combined with Steve Harris' precise and melodic bass lines. \\"Flash of the Blade\\" is not one of Maiden's hits, but i think it is an amazing song. The Duelists isnt my favorite song, but it is decent and is well constructed. I think Back In the Village is a very amazing song too, but i just have to get to my favorite track on the whole album, \\"Powerslave\\" Bruce's vocals are mind blowing and excruciatingly beautiful, and the guitar solo on this song is an amazing and spine chilling. <br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner drags out a little, but it is a good album ender. UP THE IRONS!!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|For jazz, it doesn't get much better than this. The relaxed atmosphere in which this was recorded made it possible for the musicians to achieve improvisation which had not been explored before. This is jazz at it's finest. Each musician adds a unique perspective to the ensemble sound to create great explorative music which will not be rivaled by any jazz ensemble of similar instrumentation.

0920668364|1.0|Many people have commented on the \\"creepiness\\" of a mother crawling across her adult son's floor to hold his sleeping body and sing to him.  That strikes me as creepy, too, but what bothers me more about the book is that the mother only sings her lullaby of love after her son is asleep.  It seems to be more for her benefit than his, and reading this book seems to be more for the benefit of the parent, celebrating that amazing feeling of unconditional love, than for the child. Kids need to hear that we always love them right WHEN they have trashed our bathroom and made us mad.  I knew that my own mother always loved me no matter what because she told me so- not because she sang to me after I was asleep.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|If you like movies as I do, this DVD set should satisfy any film fanatic with over 21 (that's right) extra features--clearly a prototype of what we film fans want in our DVD sets.<br /><br />To see producer Irwin Allen in his Rolls Royce and a pink polyester leisure suit (complete with white shoes) discussing the finer points of 'The Poseidon Adventure\\" and \\"Towering Inferno\\" as he takes us on a tour through 20th Century Fox is as informative as it is funny.<br /><br />Commentaries by film historian F.X. Feeney and SFX director, Mike Vezina, add another dimension to understanding this interesting film.<br /><br />Much has already been written about this film itself by the other Amazon critics here, suffice to say the acting in this motion picture (save for the two little brats in Jennifer Jones' charge) is quite good with Newman as the architect and and McQueen as the fire captain, both excellently cast.  Then again, when have these actors ever disappointed audiences in their respective roles?<br /><br />Veterans Faye Dunaway and Bill Holden rarely disappoint, Richard Chamberlain is downright creepy, and even Fred Astaire (at 80 years of age when this was made) manages to inject some needed satire here and there as he tries to woo Jennifer Jones. For those from the SF Bay Area, the setting for this movie was San Francisco and the distinctive lobby of the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero was used for many of the scenes in the first half of the movie.<br /><br />Ok, this is not going to be a long review, and the film does not really impart any substantial revelations about life and death. I could get very deep and argue that the film is a metaphor to man's vanity and ego dedicated to the capitalistic excesses of power, wealth and greed, but let's get real--it's just one damn exciting movie with excellent special effects (Academy Awards for Cinematography and Editing), reasonably good acting all around, and edge-of-your-seat entertainment.<br /><br />I just hope they don't make another remake a la \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" for this film--Irwin Allen's rendition will do just fine.Adventure\\" for this film--Irwin Allen's rendition will do just fine.
B00004W50T|5.0|I first heard this recording in the late 60s -- it spoke to me strongly then, and speaks just as strongly almost 40 years later.  I can't say that about many records made in those times.  I'm not nostalgic, I'm not a guy that sits around and listens to old Beatles and Rolling Stones albums... but I still love to listen to music from Big Pink on occasion, it just plain holds up over time. As a musician myself, I would disagree with some of the reviewers that this music is \\"simple\\".  It most certainly is not... the songs and performances are quirky and complicated, and so is the production.  The sound is a bit muddy compared to their later albums which were no doubt higher-budget affairs. (This record was made in a house, not a studio!) To me, Music From Big Pink was never really topped by the group, although it was equaled by the second album \\"The Band\\".   <br /> <br />I find it difficult to criticise Music From Big Pink in a conventional way. To me, the term \\"Americana\\" doesn't really cover it. There are elements of R & B, blues, country, hillbilly, and gospel but I can't think of any other record that blends influences and genres into a very special sound the way this one does.  Music From Big Pink has a mysterious and moody quality to it that is unique in pop music. It is not a familiar recorded sound at all, neither now nor when it was first released, and if you are new to this group, give this record time to grow on you -- I think you will be rewarded. It is a snapshot of an group that was just full of talent.  If you have never heard it before, tor the best impact I would stop the CD before the additional tracks play, they are interesting but I think they would dilute the experience for the first-time listener.  <br /> <br />If you like the Band I highly recommend the documentary DVD \\"Classic Albums - The Band\\" that gives some fascinating insight into the recording of the Band's first two albums.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I love a movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to fully understand. The Italian Job is that kind of engaging, but action-packed thriller. The cast has an exciting chemistry that keeps things interesting throughout the movie. And, of course, there are the Mini Coopers. Well worth the watch, lovers of an exciting, but intellectually stimulating action thriller will love this one.
B00005JLR8|5.0|\\"In America\\" takes hold of you right from the beginning,squeezes your heart, and never lets go.<br />A poor family enters this Country illegally, with dreams of a better life for thier family (A young Mother and Father, and thier 2 young daughters)<br /><br />They move to Hells Kitchen in an unbearably hot summer.<br />We experience just about every emotion there is as this story unfolds, and what a wonderful story it is!<br /><br />We see this through the eyes (and camera) of the 11 year old girl. We go through all this poor Irish family's trials and tribulations with them,(many of them heartbreak) and come out REFRESHED. I think it is the simplicity of the story, and the innocence of this poor family that is so ... FRESH.<br /><br />We experience what the word \\"poor\\" truely means.We feel thier loss (the death of a third child) they are still going through, and in short, We fall in love with this family.<br /><br /> We also meet one of thier neighbors that the girls befriend, who is dying,They pull him out of his deep depression at the end of his life, and the family shows him thier love, and offer him thier friendship. Yet we still  ache for him when his end comes .<br /><br />We do get to experience some joy in his death though, that he got to know the love of this wonderful family before he dies.<br /><br />This movie is a must see, and one of the 10 best I have EVER seen.<br />True, it is a tear jerker, but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more.

This album, in particular does.
0689865384|4.0|Uglies by Scott Westerfield was an enjoyable book. I agree that it was a little predictable at times, and I had trouble connecting to some of the characters, but all in all I loved this book. <br /> <br />The author worked hard to create a subtle blend of science fiction and reality, and left a lot to the imagination in the way of what actually happened to our civilization, the \\"Rusties\\".  <br /> <br />While some of the \\"futuristic\\" lingo and lifestyles got a little irritating at times, I loved the two heroines of the tale, Shay and Tally. They are startlingly real and as independant as any teenage girl who wants a different life.

Bill's interesting history, geography, side-splitting anecdotes and an unabashed love for this country make this book a great introduction to OZ.  <br /> <br />Things have changed a bit since this book was first published (Australia is in the news more, and used extensively in the U.S. in marketing campaigns.), but the basics still apply and give one a real appreciation for this fascinating country.

GOD has touched you.

6304712944|2.0|\\"Camelot\\" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on.  But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included \\"If Ever I Would Leave You\\" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet.    Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest.  Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry.    Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side.    Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors.  And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, \\"Arthur get thy wife a hankie,\\"--Ok! Ok! I admit it-I was the joker who said it.

0140177396|5.0|I first read this book for a secondary (high) school class and was instantly captivated by it. Revisiting it recently has reminded me again why the book is such a literary masterpiece.     The first thing that one notices is that the book is remarkably short for all the hype that surrounds it. Yet the book's short length is deceiving, because Steinback packs in a great narrative, some masterful descriptive pieces and a wealth of insight.     The plot revolves around the idea that the \\"the best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men, gang aft agley (often go awry)\\" - a reference Robert Burn's poem \\"To A Mouse\\". Set in the Great Depression era of the 1930s, the narrative recounts the fortunes of its two central characters, George and Lennie, who set out with their own version of the American Dream and end up falling far short. The reader is caught up in this tight and simple - but incredibly moving - storyline as the protagonists, seemingly oblivious, march inexorably towards their tragic fates.    To Steinback's supreme credit, the main characters readily engender sympathy from the reader despite the shortness of the book. Side characters are also extremely convincing and pack a bigger punch than they would in the hands of lesser authors. The character and plot development is accompanied by an abiding sense of unease, arising from the air of lingering tragedy that Steinback manages to create. Furthermore, the matter-of-fact descriptions that punctuate the narrative add an element of rawness that makes the entire tragedy believable.     Of Mice and Men, although short, left me thinking about the big things; about dreams and about destiny. It is truly a modern classic - masterful in style and timelessly relevant. I cannot recommend it more.
1401308201|5.0|\\"What a wonderful musical!\\"  If you share that sentiment, you'll want this book.  It is a wonderful collection of great pictures, behind the scenes insights, a view into how this show came into being, looks inside the minds of the players, and of course the entire dialogue and song lyrics.  Very nicely bound.  Just an excellent way to revisit and enjoy the musical again and again.  I bought one for me and another for a friend.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|After three long years, TDG have returned with \\"One X\\", a 12 song alt-rock collection not unlike their s/t 2003 debut. <br /> <br />\\"Animal I Have Become\\" may not be possess the instrumental complexity of \\"I Hate Everything About You\\", but it's rousing chorus and grooving, repetitive guitar line make for a memorable track. \\"Riot\\", One X's obvious anthem begs to be moshed to, and the title track ends things on a high note with a powerful, sing-a-long chorus.  <br /> <br />For the most part, \\"One X\\" is a strong outing. It may not hit home the first time around, but after a few spins, you'll fall in love with TDG all over again.  <br /> <br />The Verdict: 90% old, 10% new. Progression is overrated anyway.
B00000G3PA|1.0|If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers.  <br /> <br />This is a film that Ben Affleck & Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of. <br /> <br />Pure \\"leave your brain at the door\\" entertainment. <br /> <br />
0060763280|5.0|Fascinating! I couldn't put the book down. I had one of those Ah-Ha, light bulb go one sort of experiences reading this book. The principles can be applied to life in general.  <br />I wanted to take my company to the next step and have been on a Plato for a long time. I believe I just got the nudge into the right direction.  <br />This was too interesting not to attend a seminar. <br /> <br />
B00005B9UZ|3.0|Interesting war drama full of great visual effects, but cardboard performances and cliched \\"Saturday matinee\\" script.  At 1 hour, 57 minuts, this might be overlong for the casual action moviegoer.<br /><br />The special/bonus features could have been better, in my opinion, and basically only serve to showcase the already ubiquitous presence of multi-credited Jonathan Mostow.  An actor's commentary, more submarine/war achival footage and actual historical detail would have been more greatly appreciated.  Still, this was purchased in a supermarket at the bargain price of $9.99, so it actually contained a lot more material than I expected.<br /><br />Strictly for genre fans.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Muse finally broke big in the US in 2004 with the \\"Absolution\\" album. It was my No. 1 album of that year. \\"Absolution\\" (released in 2003 in the UK) was a coming out party for the UK trio in the US, with brilliant songs from beginning to end. Now comes the highly anticipated new album, Muse's 4th ablum.<br /><br />\\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" (11 tracks, 45 min.) continues the sound of \\"Absolution\\", without great departure. The opener \\"Take a Bow\\" starts things off tentatively, but \\"Starlight\\" gets things rocking. \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is a curious choice as the first single, as it is not really the best or most melodic track on here. \\"Map of the Problematique\\" follows and is one of the very best on here, with a Depeche Mode-sounding undertone. The pensive \\"Soldier's Poem\\" and \\"Invinsible\\" cut the flow of the album badly though, but things pick up nicely in the second half of the album, with \\"City of Delusion\\" and the closer \\"Knigths of Cydonia\\" as standouts.<br /><br />This is not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination. Yet I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I compare this to the masterpiece that the \\"Absolution\\" album was. I feel that this album lacks the element of surprise that put the band's \\"Absolution\\" on the top. That said, Muse is an incredible live act, and I can't wait to see how the songs on \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" translate in a live setting.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I haven't seen a cinematic musical so finely crafted and enjoyable since Singing in the Rain--Chicago is outstanding! Set in its namesake during a female murder spree, the costumes, sets, and atmosphere are right on target. The acting, singing, and dancing are so good chills will run down your spine. Renee Zellewegger is particularly inspired as Roxie, reminding me keenly of Marilyn Monroe. Queen Latifah and the remainder of the cast are equally up to the challenge, bringing Bob Fosse's musical to the screen in all its dark, glamorous glory.     Bottom line: Definitely, see it.

B0000029GA|5.0|have to agree with other reviewers and call this the best rap album ever, the lyrics on this album are quite possibly the best lyrics written in any form of music, nas has an amazing multi-syllable rhyming scheme, he uses incredible alliteration, and flows amazingly over every song. The beats are done by pete rock, big LES, dj premier, q tip and the large professor, and even though some people reviewing illmatic say the beats arent very good, i think they are actually very creative and interesting, and the producers of illmatic were the best producers around when illmatic was made, as i said before, the lyrics of illmatic are truely amazing, and its unbelievable that a 20 year old(thats how old nas was when he made illmatic) could think up lyrics like this, nas also has an interesting, voice, which makes the album better, nas paints such a perfect picture of the violent environment he grew up in, and perfectly describes his thoughts on his environment, even though he does talk about drug dealing and shooting people, he does not only rap about those things, he also raps about raps about his depression, his daughter,dead friends, and hardship of life , illmatic tells tales of shootouts, friends in prison, and crew loyalties, all with unbelievable lyrics flow, and delievery,  <br />IF YOU ARE A RAP FAN AND DONT HAVE THIS, WHAT PLANET ARE YOU ON, GO OUT AND BUY IT ASAP, TODAY IF POSSIBLE, TRUST ME, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED  <br /> <br />

B000GTJT0W|4.0|Any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here.<br /><br />\\"Sahara\\" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask \\"how,\\" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way.<br /><br />These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (\\"Thoughtcrimes\\"). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the \\"Panama,\\" which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, \\"Whatever happened to saving the best for last?\\" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc,\\" so why should that happen here? Granted, \\"Sahara\\" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than \\"National Treasure,\\" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality).<br /><br />Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that \\"Sahara\\" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere.of the way.  <br /> <br />These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (\\"Thoughtcrimes\\").

0920236162|5.0|I read this story to my son, 3.5 years old and avid dragon lover.  I received this book as a young girl and loved the book because I believed it asserted the princess' independence.  As I now read it to my son, I think it relays a different message, people who love you will do anything for you . . . and you need to appreciate it!  My son understood that the princess did what she did for love of the prince and at all costs . . . without me telling him!  Great story.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|ULTRAVIOLET reminded me a lot of TRON in the way it looked and incorporated live action into digital \\"game\\" like sets and backgrounds.  I did not expect to like this film as much as I did.  It kept me interested without having too much commitment.  It was purely a visual feast and an exceptional experience in Blu-ray.  Colors are vibrant like a first addition graphic novel, which I'm sure was the intent.  It succeeds.
0399242864|5.0|My 3.5 year old son and I thoroughly enjoy this book.  I also read it to my preschool class and it was a big hit. I think any age group can relate to the emotions in the book.  Very sweet
B00009TB5G|5.0|Now we all know the movie.  Hobbits are captured, heroes must save them, and war.  A lot of people talk about how they don't like the helm's deep battle.  While it is not very long in the book, I think it was a very good job by Peter Jackson to capitalize on action and heroic deeds being done.  The part where the Elves  show up to help with battle with that insanely awesome music playing, isn't true to the book at all, but then again, as explained in the extra's, it is fitting.  I will just say one word to get you book fans excited to get this special edition.  Gil-galad.<br /><br />So on the extras they continue their AWESOME documentary on Tolkien.  The extras would take a few days to write about and it would be much better for you to go experience it if you like the movies.  Interviews, featurettes on everything, drawings...<br /><br />The commentaries just like the the Fellowship are again surprisingly VERY entertaining.<br /><br />I wish that Amazon had a more expansive rating system, becuase I would give this a 1000/1000.  The boxed set is truly the greatest special edition of any movie ever.

B00008RH3L|4.0|The gangsters in this movie are not supposed to sound  or be acting authentic.  The characters are supposed to be fun and the voices were just awesome.  This is my favorite role from Gabriel Byrne.  The way he has no cares about anybody but himself was very interesting to watch.  There are a few plots here going on that all come together for a rather unspectacular ending, but this was still a great movie.<br /><br />So we have superb acting performances by some of the greatest actors ever.  Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, John  Turturro, Steve Buschemi....<br /><br />I didn't think it was one of Marcia Gay Harden's best performances, but still a very solid job.  Now the reason that this movie will always be remembered by me is J.E Freeman.  His acting job playing \\"The Dane\\" was the performance of the century.<br /><br />The cast interviews are pretty good.  Movie is widescreened and sound is not 5.1 but still pretty good.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Not up to the book, but tries valiantly to capture the realtionship between the 2 witches ( pre Dorothy). Works 80% of the time, a little less music and a little more character and plot development would have helped. Still, some fine tunes, dazzling effects and powerhouse performances by Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith. While I didn't leave the theater feeling elated, I wasn't disappointed either. Not a great musical, but pleasant!

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is amazing.  First off if you're thinking of buying this product you're probably a fan of Final Fantasy VII.  If you're not, I'll say two things.  One they've kindly added a little video of the game giving you the important parts of the story.  Two, umm you probably still won't understand the story.  Even if you've PLAYED Final Fantasy VII, the stories there, but ummm it's a Final Fantasy story.  I love Final Fantasy don't get me wrong, but there's loop holes and weirdness to contend with.  So why a 5, because this movie is exactly what it sets out to be.  A Final Fantasy story in the world of Final Fantasy VII with effects that will amaze you.  Not only during the fights, they'll just be sitting around and you'll be wondering how the freak did they do that???  Then you watch the fights and you're mouth is on the floor for a couple of weeks!!  If you're a fan of Final Fantasy BUY THIS!!  If you're not, what's wrong with you!!??  Play the game, then BUY THIS!!
B00007LTIL|5.0|No matter if you are a fan of the Grateful Dead or jambands at all, if you like folk-rock, 70's rock or just music in general, buy this album! American Beauty truly captures what is beautiful about America. Containing a wide array of wonderful songs such as \\"Friend of the Devil,\\" \\"Box of Rain\\" and \\"Ripple,\\" the album reveals country,folk and psychedelic rock at its best!
B00005JP4U|5.0|Here I am, slowly melting in my apartment. Last weekend, however, as a part of my \\"beat the heat\\" program, I went out to see the Al Gore film, An Inconvenient Truth. It was part of my summer viewing plan, and somehow, given the temperature outside, it seemed fitting.<br /><br />Now, I'm not a man who's always been a fan of Al Gore. For the most part, I've agreed with his politics, though I was never big on the music censorship thing (though that was mostly Tipper...?). I just think he held back during the 2000 election campaign, unwilling to appear too intelligent in comparison to his opponent. It's too bad; I think he could have cleaned Bush's clock. Why? Because he comports himself rationally and intelligently and passionately in this film.<br /><br />The film alternates between personal stories and views into Gore's life, the presentation of data and scientific analysis on global warming, analysis and views on the politics involved in the issue, and thoughts on what we can do about the situation ourselves.<br /><br />So, let me be clear about my own views on the issues at hand. The data is particularly convincing, that we have an issue of extreme importance to us all. We aren't taking it as seriously as we should. We are already seeing the consequences. Things are likely to get much worse, if we do nothing. And, frankly, we shouldn't be surprised at the cause and effect relationship here.<br /><br />Yes, the planet's climate is a complex mathematical system. However, we're hitting the system with a hammer, and the system is going to ring in response. We're not going to like the ringing response we get. It's like we're at war with ourselves, and the planet; trust me, the planet can hurt us back.<br /><br />So, those in doubt, I just recommend you open your minds a little bit, and perhaps see the movie, and give it some thought. The movie's well done...a great non-fiction/documentary on an important issue that merits discussion...and action.
B00004I9VE|5.0|If you are put off by the current actions of Michael Jackson, find comfort that he wasn't always such a screwup. This album, which is arguably his best, is really good! It has great songs like \\"Billie Jean\\" \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat it.\\" Full of danceable beats and tender love songs, it is really some of the finest music of the 80's!
B00005JOQS|4.0|Does Superman Returns Soar?        Sort Of...    Superman-The Movie was the first feature film to treat a comic book super-hero seriously, while still managing to be lots of fun in the process. It's stayed with me since the first time I saw it at the age of 10.    When director Bryan Singer announced that SR would use elements from the first 2 Superman features as a springboard for the new movie, I was both excited and intrigued at the same time...    Following a 5 year absence in search of his home world of Krypton, the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth. While arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots to create a new continent for the ultimate land grab, vowing to render our hero powerless once and for all. Superman also faces the heartbreaking realization that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, (Kate Bosworth) has moved on with her life. Superman's return means that he must somehow come to grips with that reality, while finding his place in the world that has learned to live without him.    For all intents and purposes, the film is as much a remake of the '78 film, as it is a sequel. Singer pays homage and then some---Some tips of the hat are obvious, like the flying credit sequence that opens the movie, while others only true devotees of the Donner flick would appreciate. WARNING GEEK-OUT ALERT The Daily Planet background employees, for instance, share the same names as their 1978 counterparts    Singer has made an epic film for sure, and it has lots of stuff that works--The shuttle rescue is a breathtaking sequence of film making. It was at that moment that Routh made me believe that he could do a solid job as the super blue boy scout. Having said that, I still got the impression that he is more comfortable as alter ego Clark Kent, than supes. I have no problem with Bosworth as an actress here but she still looks a bit too young for the role She also lacks Lois's trademark sass making it difficult to believe her as the star reporter. Spacey as Luthoris a hybrid of the Gene Hackman version who had an \\"affinity for beach front property\\" and the darker Lex from the modern day comics...Poor James Karen and Kal Penn. They are totally wasted here, with probably one line of dialogue each, in the movie... Parker Posey as Luthor's gal Kitty fares slightly better--but not by much. I loved the psuedo- recreation of the cover from Action Comics #1. Sooo cool!!! Seeing Jack Larson and Noel Neill from TV's The Adventures of Superman series in cameo roles is also a real kick of nostalgia.    The major issues I have with the movie start and end with the bloated screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. They try to cram so much into the story that the climax seemed like it was rushed while the mid section lumbered along. Even at 2 hours and 23 minutes the original never plodded like this one does at times. Big mistake; a comic book film should never feel like its \\"plodding\\" along.    If we are to believe that the events of SR follow those depicted in Superman II than Superman's line to the President, in that film--\\"I'll never let you down again\\" is meaningless--Because he lets everyone down by leaving without an explanation. I find it hard to belive he would do that...    And there's more... The Kid--The fact that Supes was a mortal when he slept with Lois in II, means any offspring would be human, no?...and the famous memory wipe smooch means Lois would have had no knowledge of having slept with our hero in the first place. The end of the movie hints otherwise... Those aspects are forgotten by Singer and Co. entirely and left dangling--waiting to be answered. As disciples to Donner's vision--I expected those plot points to be adressed here and now and not for the sequel... All glossed over in favor of seeing our hero eavesdrop on Lois and new beau Richard White (James Marsden, who finally has a decent part in a comic book flick) more than once. Is this Superman, or Stalkerman?! Lois' kid Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) is the obvious set up for sequels.    Maybe there I will find the answers to my questions...I wonder ever so briefly...Would it have been better to start anew?...    I liked the movie very much---But I was left wanting to feel more exhilarated--The film rates a 7.5 (1-10) . I don't know if those expectations I tried so hard to keep in check, got in the way, but it definitely looses points in places that I wasn't expecting.
B000068PQ0|5.0|At a time when NSYNC was still a band, there was little hope for the future of music.....And then came the Flaming Lips with Yoshimi! Not to say that previous Lips albums aren't good, on the contrary, some are amazing, but I always felt they hit their stride with this one. There will most likely be a million people arguing that the soft bulletin is better, but what can i say? I love Yoshimi!Great songs that make you THINK and have beautiful melodies! If there is one record you buy from the last 10 years, buy Yoshimi!

It will make all the difference.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"The image that I had was...dancing...freely, like a wild woman, holding no secrets\\" explains Madonna, while being translated during one of many television appearances promoting Confessions On A Dancefloor. The quote appears to be the best reasoning for the new, \\"all dance\\" concoction, among mis-representations that Madonna has returned to her roots. I'm sure Madonna has incorporated some of the fun bubblegum styling's of her first, self-titled album, but \\"Confessions\\" is no revisitation. I would even consider the album a blending of her last three albums, just a bit more up-tempo. Since track-by-track analyzing yields the most info and enjoyment out of fans and potential buyers, that's what's happening next.  <br /> <br />Ok...there's no doubt \\"Hung Up\\" has become one of Madonna's most popular global hits. It's an extremely commercial pop song, and I'm sure because I cringe when my new online buddy claims to be a fan of Madonna on account of this song, what a Madonna virgin. Ofcourse \\"Hung Up\\" milks the hard earned Abba sample, but the simple - yet funky lyrics and music otherwise has me sold. Personally, the music video was a major disappointment - my jaw dropped when I saw it for the first time. I soon realized that the video must have been trying to showcase Madonna's yoga & pilates body as well as a celebration of dancing by herself, as well as the dancers - in that it doesn't fail. Just as a side note...I thought that the second part of verse two could have been a verse of it's own (I can't keep on waiting for you...), but it sounds ok. <br /> <br />Now for the song that I don't know what do to with...worshipped it at first, but lately I avoid it as much as possible. It's \\"Get Together\\", probably the greatest summation of what \\"Confessions\\" is all about. With the irresistible, \\"Down, down, down in your heart - find, find, find the secret\\", it's dance-worthy and more importantly, single-worthy. The music video for this number is mildly enjoyable - an animated background featuring a \\"real\\" matching colorized Madonna & some of her dancers. The technology used to put her in there is fascinating alone. <br /> <br />To conclude the heavily commercial opening, there's \\"Sorry\\" the incredibly catchy second single. The genius repetition of \\"I heard it all before\\" is a tactic previously used in Hung Up's \\"Time goes by...so slowly\\". Madonna also recites the word \\"sorry\\" in a handful of languages in the beginning and again before the climax. This song is also supported by a video - a continuation of \\"Hung Up\\", equally cool with some awesome dancing toward the end. <br /> <br />The fourth song, \\"Future Lovers\\" is the true opening to Confessions On A Dancefloor, a great choice to open the \\"Confessions Tour\\" as well. Madonna speaks for a while in the beginning \\"about love\\", welcoming and persuading the listener. If you accept her advances and continue listening, you're in for a sonic journey. Oddly, this track's lyrics are of the same heavenly, ethereal class as Ray Of Light. \\"Future Lovers\\" calls for booming sound equipment, this song will convince alot of people to get a new set of speakers - just watch. <br /> <br />\\"Other places...make me feel like a dork\\", simple, a bit juvenile - but to the point. In \\"I Love New York\\", Madonna addresses a few famous cities in contrast to the place where her career began. She has expressed that the song is not as literal as the words imply, but the song does boast the \\"unapologetic\\" elements as it was marketed to have. My first thought was that this is Ray Of Light (song) II, with it's feel good quality - achieved through the guitar and simple electronic sounds. <br /> <br />Madonna may be trying to redeem herself, but didn't completely leave the world weary themes of \\"American Life\\" behind. \\"Let It Will Be\\" is one of the more gritty, real songs from \\"Confessions\\". The title confuses me a bit, and I do have my own interpretation of why the phrase is \\"let it will be\\", but I won't get into that. Fresh from the philosophy-ready Madonna of \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\", she sings, \\"Now I can tell you about success, about fame - about the rise and the fall, of all the starts in the sky\\" She must really believe she has the codes to the universe. The songs gem is Madonna's breathy delivery of the chorus, although \\"Let It Will Be\\" is in it's full glory in the remixed live version...you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />Available as an R&B-ish song on \\"Bedtime Stories\\", \\"Confessions\\" brings us the new \\"Forbidden Love\\". I love the filtering of the voice and the background here, although the beginning sounds like a dying animal...wow. The electronic chiming chorus is irresistible - probably the slowest track on the album, but enjoyable by any dance fan. It's basically a love story, naming a few things that confirm that a couple should pursue a relationship. It is sort of hypocritical though, when the chanting \\"Forbidden Love\\" is unleashed. If you listen carefully, there is a countdown...could it be Madonna? You tell me. <br /> <br />Many fans consider \\"Jump\\" as a possible single, with reports that \\"Get Together\\" is the final single release from \\"Confessions\\", we will have to wait and see. \\"Jump\\" is just classic Madonna. A classic pop song, classic pop theme. One of those inspirational \\"follow your dreams\\" kind of songs. \\"Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump, don't ever look back - oh baby - yes, I'm ready to jump - just take my hand. Get ready to, are you ready?\\" Perfect. It's single ready, can't wait. <br /> <br />Again considering the fans, they seem to like \\"How High\\". I think it's a filler track for sure. The vocals remind me so much of Britney Spears. I'm not a fan of the chorus, although the monster-like voice filtering is pretty cool. \\"It's funny, I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about\\" is one of the better lines. I like the alarm and cymbal sound effects, \\"How High\\" is like a sequel to \\"Let It Will Be\\".  <br /> <br />The middle-eastern chants in \\"Isaac\\" during the chorus especially are very pleasant to listen to and quite catchy. Nice spooky intro here, overall it's a dark sounding track - very enjoyable. It has the \\"Mmmm\\" humming of \\"Frozen\\" and some haunting lyrics. The climaxes are quite nice toward the end, with Madonna's buddy speaking some religious imagery toward the end. Very good Madonna track...could have worked for a few past albums - showing that she hasn't lost her style in this new dance album. <br /> <br />\\"Push\\" was one of my favorite tracks from the beginning. You can either love or hate this song...there's no in between. \\"You push me\\" is quite repetitive, and there isn't much vocal ability apparent in the verses, but the track is quite funky! \\"Push\\" is probably dedicated to her husband and others who've influenced her in a positive way. It's a dedication to those who've pushed buttons and caused a change for the better.  <br /> <br />\\"Confessions\\" gets really unapologetic with it's slightly-dark, visual \\"Like It Or Not\\". The title says it all. \\"I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake - all of my fruit is yours to take. Better the devil that you know, your love for me will grow - because...\\"...very good lyrically. It's a song that portrays Madonna's attitude flawlessly. I don't know about you, but I love her...and it's good to hear that she's \\"never gonna stop - no, no\\". Ironic ending, too. It's a dance album, but abruptly ends with an acoustic guitar - again, genius. <br /> <br />As for the limited edition bonus track, \\"Fighting Spirit\\", it's a song that I wish was included as the last track of \\"American Life\\". The laser like sound effects from the song \\"American Life\\" are found here as well. It's good lyrically, pattern-like as seen in \\"Push\\". Excellent track, but not a good addition to \\"Confessions\\" - especially at the end.  <br /> <br />If you belong to the Icon fan club...or obtained it by other means (hehe)...\\"Super Pop\\" has been made available to you. It's a very groovy song, naming a few of Madonna's favorites with emotions, cars, songs, and more. It's sort of tongue-in-cheek and has a good dose of attitude. I, myself, don't like the vocals very much, and the chorus is a good slogan - but not that good. \\"If you want to reach the top...if you do you'll never stop\\"...I'm glad it wasn't on \\"Confessions\\", that's all. <br /> <br />So there's the music of it all... <br /> <br />If you picked up the CD, you get an average booklet of photos - but as a fan, you've probably seen most of the photo shoot. The booklet features some lyrics from \\"Confessions\\", which really don't match with the overall theme of a dance album, but it's a nice idea. The back cover has Madonna's leg in conjunction with a disco ball, which I don't really like...but it's a cool design. When you open the CD box, the CD resembles a disco ball ofcourse...and you find Madonna posing looking down when you lift the CD out. The back of the booklet has the song list. <br /> <br />The limited edition is a truly better, if you can spare over twice the price if the CD. The \\"book\\" that's included makes 100% sense with the theme of dance, and \\"Confessions\\" all together. It's set up with black pages with text on the left and pictures of Madonna on the right, accept for some two page spreads. I like how in the beginning you get the full picture that was used for the CD cover, without the Madonna logo and writing. The journal is cute, it is completely un-lined white pages with some notes from Madonna - which are just lyrics from \\"Like It Or Not\\" fused with some cute cartoon illustrations. <br /> <br />The design of the artwork is almost frustrating. Simply because the round \\"disco\\" pattern is oddly colored and sometimes over-used. I mean, the color scheme is brown with pink and purple...I wish those shapes were colored saturated pink and blue...something like that. Madonna's new body is definitely in the fore-front in the photos, one could even recruit the CD booklet or limited edition bookas a pamphlet on stretching and yoga positions. <br /> <br />And finally... <br /> <br />\\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" has the element of celebration. It did not impress me, I don't think it impressed alot of Madonna's listeners. It is a great return to some mainstream attention - which is great. I think that Madonna's legendary image and persona might shadow average effort, that may have happened here - although it's a good record. Just think about it. If this was a new artists debut album would you be impressed? I would definitely be. But the thing is, this is not a big step up for Madonna.  <br /> <br />Good album, good look, good attention...point blank. <br /> <br />5 stars/5
B0009IW9DE|5.0|Maybe 1985's 'Scarecrow' was the album that elevated John Mellencamp to superstar status in the US but 'The Lonesome Jubilee'still remains musically,his boldest album.The album features nine musicians and himself, playing no less than 23 different instruments including dobro,banjo,congas,hammer dulcimer,fiddle and penny whistle.The result is a strong,rich,textured,stylish album which gets stronger with every listen.The main themes throughout 'The Lonesome Jubilee' are the hopes and aspirations of working class, blue collar Americans,particularly in the mid-west where Mellencamp was born and lives.The album begins with the uptempo 'Paper In Fire' an uptempo brassy opener.'Down And Out In Paradise' is about the struggle of everyday life .The first single taken from the album 'Check It Out' is about the disillusionment of being a family man, 'Going to work on Monday,you got yourself a family,all the utility bills have been paid,you can't tell your best buddy that you love him' he goes on to hope that the future generations that ride on the highways that we build have a better understanding.'Cherry Bomb' is an innocent,nostalgic tale of growing up and being in love when 'holding hands meant something'.'We Are The People' is about hope and optimism in a cold world as Mellencamp sings 'if you're feeling shut down may my thoughts be with you,if you're a black man being being shoved down and kicked all around then my thoughts are with you'.'Hard Times For An Honest Man' is exactly about what the title states whereas 'Hotdogs And Hamburgers' is a tale of injustice and forgiveness.'The Lonesome Jubilee' is basically a series of short realistic tales about life,love,hardship,hope and survival.It is at times melancholic but overall it is a deep,warm,folk rock record which in my opinion John Mellencamp has never bettered.
B000FSME1A|2.0|Apocalypse Now has been released so many times on dvd now, you would think that with the herald of this, you would get the ultimate. Well guess what? You won't. The disastrous problem - yet again - with this edition is that for some godforsaken reason Coppola and DP, Storaro refuse to release the print in it's FULL WIDESCREEN MAJESTY. For each edition to date, AN has suffered a horrific butchery to its aspect ratio. What you must understand is that AN was filmed in Technovision, shot with anamorphic lenses in the 2.35:1 format. That's how it's been exhibited in theaters, including the Redux theatrical run. But for dvd these two have stubbornly refused to let the audience drink in the full width of this masterpiece. It has been released only in about 1.95:1 to 2:1 on dvd and there IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR THIS. Having seen Redux on a theater screen I can attest to the superior composition employed by Vittorio Storaro. Case in point: the helicopter attack. That sequence is absolutely a miracle to behold, especially with the superb sound mix. Yet every time I've decided to view the film on my HDTV, the excitement is dumbed down because the image is CROPPED on both sides of the screen. Remember, this was filmed with anamorphic lenses - there was NO matting performed to achieve widescreen. So WHY, in this day and age, do the two principals refuse to fully open up the frame?? It boggles the mind. It is NOT as if we are bemoaning any longer \\"them damn black bars\\". For the love of this film, all copies should be recalled and the film should be given it's PROPER and CORRECT 2.35:1 aspect for ALL to see. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is for the much desired commentary track.    Having just read the AV FAQ on the dvd, I am even more outraged. The explanation goes that the 2:1 cropping is done to achieve a \\"compromise\\", to accomodate 4:3 televisions. Apparently Francis and Vittorio are unaware that almost ALL televisions sold now are in the 16:9 aspect ratio. They even try to get away with their visual desecration by saying that \\"well, gee you'd still get black bars on a 16:9 screen!\\" UN-BE-LIEVABLE. For god sake, there are dvd players that have a zoom feature that will do the same goddamned thing!! I have lost all respect for Storaro - is he SENILE?!? As for Coppola...his legacy remains, though I'd love nothing more than to smash a bottle of his own wine over his head for allowing - yet again - a masterpiece be handled with utter disrespect, and by his own hands no less. Shame.    For those who think the missing sides of the frame are \\"no big deal\\", do this: cue up Apocalypse Now [disc 1] to the 40:52 mark. You'll see a ground tracking shot of an ox and cart running away with mud huts exploding behind them - but from what? Well, if the FULL 2.35:1 aspect ratio were rightfully presented you see a helicopter in the top upper left corner of the frame in pursuit. It's an amazing composition, but it is CHOPPED AWAY. It's a brief, but striking example of widescreen framing. Maybe, if you're lucky your monitor has ZERO OVERSCAN and you can see a sliver of helicopter, but 99% of you will miss it altogether.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This is a fairly good cd.  I really like her voice and she has a good range.  The songs on here are good and probably going to make a few more top 10 hits yet.  I like the regae sounds in Crazy Little Thing Called Love, I like the nice ballad Final Goodbye (good vocals in that song), S.O.S (which admittedly is now way overplayed but still an excellent song) and while Unfaithful is a good song, I prefer the remix to it.  Hot on the heels of her debut sucess, if she keeps up this kind of pace and makes equally good music like that that is on here, she will be around for a while to come.  She shows no signs of the sophomore slump that other artists can sometimes go through.  It's no wonder this cd has gone platinum, it really is quite good and people with varied tastes in music will find something in here for them.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|\\"Underworld\\" was one of the surprise hits of 2003, so it was no surprise that the filmmakers would come out with a sequel. And what a sequel it is! Cat-suited Kate Beckinsale, as Selene, is back as a butt-kicking action hero (if anyone's interested in doing an updated version of the old \\"Avengers\\" TV show, Kate should be the first one they call about playing the Mrs. Peel role), and this time the issues get personal.<br /><br />The director, Len Wiseman (Beckinsale's husband), exercises great care here. Obviously he knows he's onto something with this budding franchise, and he isn't about to throw something together and shove it on the screen. He also had the sense to cast veteran British character actor Derek Jacobi in a supporting role, and he takes the film to another level just by showing up.<br /><br />Wiseman gives the film a dreamy look. Its shot mostly at dusk or at nighttime, or gloomy interiors, with blue the dominant color. There's a marvellous scene at the very end when, evil having been defeated--for now--the sun suddenly shines on Beckinsale and the flim glows.
B00028HBKM|4.0|jesus might have suffered - but did he suffer the way as portrayed in the movie? <br /> <br />in the movie the roman commanders are shown as sympathetic and cultured in comparison to the roman soldiers and jewish priests. <br /> <br />but most of the torture that jesus undergoes seems to be because of the negligence of the roman high command. though the roman commanders expressly warn the soldiers not to overly punish jesus, still that's what the soldiers precisely seem to do. as a result in some scenes the audience is almost left groaning : roman commanders, where the heck are you? <br /> <br />and right after a really serious beating, just when the commander has warned the soldiers off, one soldier forces a crown of rose thorns on jesus's head - how can that be possible? <br /> <br />the roman empire didn't grow because of undisciplined soldiers, did it? <br /> <br />i think gibson wanted to shock the viewers to reflect on the validity of jesus's message. i've seen this movie three times. the first time i was simply shocked. but on repeated viewing i think a greater application of intelligence might have brought out the message better than all this unnecessary gore. <br /> <br />anyway for what it is worth, if this movie can make people reflect on soul, god and substance in life, amidst the materialism and hedonism of today, i think this movie would have achieved its goal.

B00003CX8N|5.0|If you've ever struggled to find a copy of Aubrey's BRIEF LIVES, or Burton's THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY (during one of the periods when it was out of print), or Sprat's THE HISTORY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY, or an edition of Samuel Johnson's sermons, or Coleridge's AIDS TO REFLECTION, this is the movie for you.  Based on Helene Hanff's book by the same title, this movie details the nearly twenty-year friendship between New Yorker Helene Hanff and the denizens of Marks & Co., a purveyor of second hand books in London, and especially between Hanff and the store manager Frank P. Doel.  It is a highly unusual movie in that it takes place both in New York and London and the main characters never meet.  But the wit and liveliness, playfulness and the deep respect expressed in the long series of letters exchanged between Hanff and Frank and his colleagues are beyond what any description can depict.  They are a series of letters written in marvelous prose by lovers of the great prose of the English language.<br /><br />The movie begins in 1949 with Helene Hanff, a poor writer in New York with highly literary tastes in largely pre-Romantic English prose (though she makes exceptions for Newman), writing Marks and Co. concerning the availability of several titles.  What ensues is a delightful exchange of books, food items (when England was still suffering from rationing), and ideas.  Not a great deal happens in the film.  There are no great crises.  There are no action sequences.  There are a couple of deaths and weddings, but essentially the film is filled with only the most everyday of occurrences.  But one will be hard pressed to find a film that better communicates the love of great literature or the value of friendship, even if that friendship is conducted entirely via the post.  The film is especially good at depicting the passage of time from the late forties to the sixties, reflecting not merely the changes in fashions but in the changes in the individuals themselves.<br /><br />In a film like this, all depends on the cast.  Mel Brooks had purchased the film rights to the book for his wife, Anne Bancroft, for whom the role of Helene Hanff was perfect.  For key role of Frank Doel, the not-quite-yet-famous Anthony Hopkins, four years before super stardom as a result of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMB, brought the perfect blend of elegant reserve and quiet intelligence.  Many of the best parts of the movie were those in which either Bancroft as Helene or Hopkins as Frank spoke aloud the contents of letters, many of them discussing editions of books.  The absolute best parts of the movie were those in which Helene engaged in full stem rants about particularly offensive editions of books, the finest of those being her over the top rampage against the Modern Library edition of the Complete Poetry and Selected Prose of John Donne and the Complete Poetry of William Blake.  I particularly delighted in this one because I myself once debated with someone about why they sought fit to put Donne and Blake inside the same covers.  They are both religious poets, but why would you put the upper class Anglican Donne alongside the mystic dissenter, working class Blake?<br /><br />I don't know if you would like this movie even if you have no interest in books.

I felt and feel like I AM the character of Russell in the book, I've gone through so many of the things he has. I even cried after reading the sequel after this one because it made me look at my own situation and how hard it is to be gay and love someone who might never talk to you again if they knew. I feel like this book deserves several awards, it certainly had a touch to me.
B00004T9UF|5.0|God you haters are absolutely pathetic. It seems that practically every item I review I have to write stuff to all these stupid haters. So Eminem sucks does he, Well come on, give us a freestyle if you think your better? Your just jealous of Eminem because his out there selling millions of records and your a bunch of ten year old kids having to scavenge money off your parents. Eminem's ruined rap my a**. He is one of the best rappers out there today and don't say he sucks compared to some non mainstream rappers because all non mainstream rappers suck a**. And if his lyrics could have been written by a fourth grader than how come 10 year olds like you can't become famous like he is? huh. Exactly becuase he has talent and that his why his records all go platinum and if he didn't have talent than Dr Dre would not have helped him and I think Dr Dre knows better than a bunch of juvenile idiots like yourselves. If you don't like Em's s*** so much than why did you wast time writing neg reviews? Who the f*** told you people that your any sort of a judge, idiots like you are in no position to judge this mulit talent MC on his skills in anyway at all. <br /> <br />Well I got that over and done with. Now the album. The first rapper I got into was 50 Cent but a while after that I got into stuff like Eminem. I then became totally addicted and I got all his albums. This and the Slim Shady LP are definitely his illest albums so if you like this you should also get the Slim Shady LP. This is ill as with crazy a** lyrics that more than earn a parental advisory sticker. My favourite song would have to be the hit \\"Stan\\" which is a song about a diehard Eminem fan called Stan how ends up killing himself becuase Eminem doesn't respond to his fanmail. However other songs like The Way I Am, Kill You, Kim, Criminal, Marshall Mathers, I'm Back and Amityville are great aswell. You will find that there is not one weak track on this which certainly makes it ill as. If you are an Eminem fan thanyou should already have this but if you have just gotten into Eminem than go get this now.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere isn't a life-changing novel, but it is an original work, twisted and twisty, dark, complete, and fascinating. Gaiman's style is better adapted to graphic novels and children's books, but he nonetheless manages to write a novel that will capture the reader until its completion and open up an entirely new, upside-down, crazy world.<br /><br />Even though, prior to reading this book, I had read some of Gaiman's other work and was familiar with his obsessions and style, I was impressed by this novel. It's more gripping and entertaining than I expected, and while the depth is questionable there is plenty of room for analysis, curiosity, questions, and discussion.<br /><br />Gaiman turns London upside down for this novel--literally. Much of the book takes place in London Below, a place of fiefdoms, beasts, magic, and curses that a man from London Above is thrown into unsuspecting. Gaiman's new world is so immense that it would be impossible to fit into a single novel, but he does manage to give enough insight into it that the reader can glimpse the complexity and depth of that world. In fact, he may try to take on too much and show us too much, but that's debatable. He forces the reader to accept and embrace this entirely new, backwards world just as the main character does, and the result is an acceptance of the unknown, the forgotten, and even the impossible.<br /><br />Much of the text seems to hearken back to Alice in Wonderland, a style that Gaiman imitates somewhat unsuccessfully and twists into a darker mimicry. He creates a looking glass world that does provide commentary on who we really are and what we are capable of, and for that reason I enjoyed this book. I read it quickly, was engrossed by it, and loved Gaiman's new world. However, Gaimen is not quite as successful in creating Wonderland as Lewis Carroll was, which makes the text a bit disappointing and strips away some of the depth that it needs. There are more characters and more ground to cover with a more coherent plot, which creates a satisfying ending but lessens the sense of wonder and meaning. Don't expect this book to change your life, but to expect it to entertain you greatly and make you think a little. It's a text that I plan to reread, but it doesn't make my list of favorites.cover with a more coherent plot, which creates a satisfying ending but lessens the sense of wonder and meaning.

B00005AQGH|5.0|If Me Against The World's his best, All Eyez On Me,s his second best than this has to be his third best. I listened to this alot recently seeing I had these songs stuck on my mp3 player for about a month but I didn't get sick of them. It is a bit let down because of people like The Outlawz. Tupac must have been a pretty decent guy to let talentless people like The Outlawz be on his songs. They all have extremely annoying voices and do not deserve to be on songs with the legendary Tupac Shakur. My ratings for the songs are the following. <br /> <br />1. Bomb First (My Second Reply) 10/10 Great start to the album <br />2. Hail Mary 10/10 My favourite famous song on this album with bangin beats <br />3. Toss It Up 8.5/10 Not Such a big fan of this one and I can't really see why it is a hit <br />4. To Live & Die In L.A. 10/10 My second favourite hit, a bit like California Love in a way <br />5. Blasphemy 10/10 Big fan of this one, Very dark with Tupac's voice very deep  <br />6. Life Of An Outlaw 9/10 The beats are great, I don't care for talentless people like the Outlawz though <br />7. Just Like Daddy 9.5 More of the Outlawz however it has a great chorus and Pac is great when he is rapping <br />8. Krazy 10/10 I can't give this song less than 10/10 <br />9. White Man'z World 10/10 Classic, I can see why this made the Death Row Greatest Hits <br />10. Me And My Girlfriend 9.5/10 I believe Tupac is talking to his gun like its his girlfriend in this one.  <br />11. Hold Ya Head 10/10 A bit like Keep Ya Head Up in a way, great song <br />12. Against All Odds 10/10 A favourite, a dark song with disses to people like Mobb Deep <br />
0140131558|4.0|The New York Trilogy is composed of three seemingly unconnected texts, all of which involve writing, notebooks, detective cases, and New York City. In City of Glass, Quinn, a detective-story novelist, becomes a detective himself and is wrapped up in a bizarre case about language. In Ghosts, Blue is a private eye hired by Black to monitor and report on White. For a year he watches White, and Blue's own life dissolves in the process. In The Locked Room, the narrator's childhood friend Fanshawe disappears, leaving behind a family and a closet of manuscripts. As the narrator sorts thought the manuscripts for publication, he becomes increasingly obsessed with Fanshawe's life, disappearance, and death. As a trilogy, the stories are entirely unconnected save for the themes of language, writing, notebooks, and investigation that carry through them all. The end result is a slew of unsolved mysteries that, as Auster often does, tantalize and lead on the reader without providing satisfying conclusions. The ideas are interesting, the texts read quickly, but they are ultimately unsatisfying, the questions are never answered, and they promise more than they ever deliver.<br /><br />City of Glass was originally published alone and has an unfinished ending. The rest of The New York Trilogy offers no answers, but rather opens up new questions and rehashes familiar ideas in a series of unconnected-but-similar plots. The ideas are fascinating: Auster studies the uses of language, words, and writing, he dabbles a bit in identity and one's life's work and purpose, and he wraps all of his theories in mysteries and detective stories. The texts read quickly and keep you on your toes, looking for clues, interested in the plot progression.<br /><br />However, the book isn't nearly as interesting when reread, and that says something about the mysteries themselves: unlike a good detective novel, the plots in Auster's texts never reach their conclusion. There are a plethora of clues and ideas, but ultimately the clues lead nowhere: there is no conclusion. As a result, the end of each text is frustrating, no matter how successful the body of it was, and rereads are tainted from the beginning with the knowledge that the text will never resolve itself.<br /><br />If you are willing to explore Auster's ideas and deal with unsatisfactory conclusions, then I recommend this series. Up until the end, each installment is interesting, a little grotesque, unique, even ingenious. However, if you're looking for a solid plot then I advise you to pass over the series and instead find a writer who not only builds up but also delivers. Auster fails to do that--a purposeful choice, no doubt, but frustrating nonetheless.as, but ultimately the clues lead nowhere: there is no conclusion.

B00005AQE8|5.0|I wrote something about that clown \\"MTV Supporter\\" in my \\"Me Against The World\\" review but i'll write something in this. If Tupac is garbage than how come his the number 1 MC of all time? huh. And if your 18 then how can you be on here writing neg reviews about masterpieces like Tupac's All Eyez On Me and Me Against The World. Exactly, your a 10 year old idiot like the rest of the Tupac haters. Come on, I know that every single Tupac hater out there is a little s***head with nothing better to do than hate on masterpieces. I'm sorry son but you don't know what your calling garbage here and nobody listens to stupid kids like you. <br /> <br />Anyway this is Tupac's second best album Me Against The World being his first. But this is fantastic and I honestly don't know how anyone can not like this. It is a bit let down by some talentless guest appearances by people like the Outlawz but its still amazing. This album has the best beats out of all Tupac's albums and most of the tracks are classics. There are a few fillins like Got My Mind Made Up, When We Ride and Ain't Hard 2 Find but a legendary rapper like Tupac deserves a few fillins. They really should have put in California Love original version instead of a remix but the remix is not terrible. The songs on this album I like are <br />Ambitionz Az A Ridah, Skandalouz, How Do U Want It, 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, No More Pain, Heartz Of Men, Only God Can Judge Me, Tradin War Stories, California Love Remix, I Ain't Mad At Cha, Can't C Me, Shorty Wanna Be A Thug, Holla At Me, Thug Passion, Picture Me Rollin, Ratha Be Ya N****, All Eyez On Me and Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find <br /> <br />Your are not any sort of a rap fan if you do not own this masterpiece.
0060853964|2.0|I read this book out of my fondness of Neil Gaiman, but, in my humble opinion, it's not the best he's done. Good Omens is too pointlessly clever and amusing for its own good, and the over-emphasis on the blatantly funny means sacrificing sarcasm and even dark humor, to say nothing of meaning or point. I know this is a well-loved text, but it's not very well-loved by me, even if it's manageable, amusing read.<br /><br />90% of this text is humor. As a personal bias, it wasn't a style of humor that appealed to me, and that may have influenced my dislike for the book. I will say, however, that even this humor worked for me only some of the time, the book is funny, even if it's not much else. There are some good one-liners and short dialogs that are undeniably amusing. The sarcasm, dark humor, and complex humor I expected from Gaiman is, however, entirely missing. Pratchett's style and humor appears to take over, and there is no room for much else it in such a light, funny book, which was a disappointment. This is not Gaiman as I know and love him.<br /><br />The other drawback of the ever-present light humor is that the book is almost entirely lacking in depth--it is lacking in anything, really, other than that light humor. There is an attempt to include it--averting the apocalypse means accepting and embracing human nature, the way things are, and other goodness--but these touches seem and are last-minute, unsupported, and unnecessary. The meaning hangs on the end of the book without fitting in.<br /><br />This book has an appeal to those that enjoy a light read and ever-present light humor. It is quick and easy to read through, and even if your taste in humor is for the dark and complex, there are some real personalities and good bits that make the book worth reading. However, it's not a book that I recommend especially if you have a darker sense of humor, especially when Gaiman has written so much else that's worth reading. I know I'm in the minority for that opinion, but I just didn't love this book.opinion, but I just didn't love this book.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|This CD is a lot grittier than any of their others.  They somehow managed to pull of the slightly pop-y \\"Drag,\\" to the trip-hop \\"Space Monkey.\\"  Two of my favorites, however, had to be the ballads \\"Pierrot the Clown\\" and \\"Follow the Cops Back Home.\\"  I don't think, outside of \\"Centrefolds,\\" Placebo has ever managed to put so much emotion into a song.  You can feel the mental dejection yet resigned acceptance of an abusive love affair in \\"Pierrot\\" and the sad life of those living and loving without really living or loving in \\"Follow the Cops.\\"  Placebo does in this CD what most artists never achieve - they eclectically take little portions of genres from here and there, stringing them together to form one remarkable CD.  It is as if Brian has matured so much in the past few years, both mentally and vocally.  He sounds wonderful, wonderful, wonderful - I should have expected nothing less from my favorite boys. :)
B0000035GN|5.0|1994 was a good year. A very good year. <br />Jon Spencer wailing 'Dang' showed me their was another world in music I had yet to discover. On TV Jay Mascis in a golf cart singing 'Feel the Pain' and the Weezer guys being dorks in front of a blue square are just performing in Arnold's quickly became the images of my youth. But there was more, underneath were also the incredibly fuzzy but superious songs by Guided by Voices, the genious of Pavement and the perfect pop song \\"Skull\\". <br /> <br />Did I know that Lou Barlow used to be in Dinosaur Jr? or that they released many albums before this? no, but this album blew me away when I bought it. The rolicking \\"License to Confuse\\", the uptempo gems \\"Magnet's Coil\\" and the 2 chord song \\"Rebound\\" were instant classics. Lou Barlow immediately became one of the most lauded singer/songwriters in indie circles. Perfect songs like \\"Skull\\" (a drug song), \\"Together or Alone\\" or \\"Mystery Man\\" are still great today. <br /> <br />Sebadoh has always been a 2 1/2 man deal. Lou Barlow writes the best songs and Jason Loewenstein can chime in with some songs as well. On many albums this means unevenness because Loewensteins songs are clearly not as good as Barlows. But \\"Bakesale\\" also has the best of Jason's work with \\"Careful\\" and the brilliant \\"Not a Friend\\". <br /> <br />It's their heaviest album I think, no acoustic lo-fi songs, heavy guitars even on the slower songs and a clear sound that defines every song. <br /> <br />I still think this is the most even Sebadoh album they ever made. Barlow's songs may have gotten more sophisticated afterwards, but the overall equality of \\"Bakesale\\" they never reached again.
037571457X|5.0|The ones you love are imprisoned, brutally treated, executed .... when you lose SO much, live in fear, want to rebel against all that is dreadful and scary and horrible -- and you are a child???<br /><br />You can keep it all in -- you can tell others -- you can write a diary, which in this case, is in the form of a comic book -- but nothing in here is comical. Marjane Satrapi gives us an astounding chronicle of oppression and hope, love and fear, through the eyes of a child, an adolescent, a refugee. With the use of simple black and white comic strips, she conveys how such events are seen and grasped through the eyes and innocence of a child trying to survive and make sense of what is transpiring all around her.<br /><br />A keen observer, this child Marjane Satrapi, with a keen sense of justice, an active determination to change things, a deep well of sadness and anger when those she loves are brutally eliminated. Yet despite her justifiable anger, melancholy, and sadness , she also maintains an astounding sense of humor (mixed with or without irony) in some instances, that helps bouy her up.<br /><br />As I read this book (which despite its comic book appearances is a Deeeep read), I too was caught up in all that was going on in front of Marjane Satrapi's eyes, and can only commiserate with those unknown and nameless children in other war and revolution-torn lands who are also going through what Marjane Satrapi experienced.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This album was truly a MASTERPIECE. I mean 7 TOP 10 singles (3 of them #1), 8 grammy awards and multiple others, 3 years on the charts, and a spot in \\"The Guiness Book Of World Records\\" as The Largest Selling Album Of All Time. This album sold over 30 million copies when CD's didn't really exist and 2 decades later sales have more than doubled because people everywhere are still buying copies. <br /> <br />  Let's face it Michael was already a Superstar with his success from \\"Off The Wall\\" and with the Jackson 5. However it was \\"Thriller\\" that made him a LEGEND and skyrocketed him to the throne as \\"THE KING OF POP\\". This album captured the eyes, ears, and hearts of billions of people all over the world. I believe that this album is what also lead Michael to the \\"Artist Of The Decade Award\\" in 1989 and later \\"The Artist Of The Millenium Award\\" in 1999. <br /> <br />  I still have my original copies on LP and casette but when I saw this remastered CD in stores I didn't hesitate to pick one up. Listening to tracks like \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\" again with enhanced sound quality. I also really liked the bonus tracks and interviews too. What I liked best was hearing that Scary 2nd verse by Vincent Price on \\"Thriller\\". What I didn't understand was why didn't this disc contain a new release of \\"thriller\\" with both verses. Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, and Rod Temperton really made a great team. Maybe they should all get together again and compose another successful album. <br /> <br />  I have to agree that this wasn't a perfect album because if it was then every track would have been a #1 hit at some point and it would have sold over 100 million copies.This CD is a must have for all MJ fans, DJ's, and music collecters young or old. If you don't already have a copy I strongly suggest that you get your hands on one while you still can!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I've seen the movie for 8 times, and it is still super.  <br /> <br />Intro/Credits: <br /> <br />As i've ventured in the spoilers forum, so i know the credits were made similar to the donner films. But watching it on the big screen for the first time in my life is really amazing. I have goosebumps all over, especially with the familiar John Williams score. FANTASTIC. <br /> <br />Plot/Story: <br /> <br />I really love how Bryan paced the movie. There is definitely a balance between action and plot. <br /> <br />The start of the film where we see Superman returning, and Martha having the talk to Clark was just amazing. I could really feel the emotions. <br /> <br />The relationship between Superman, Lois and Richard were cleverly crafted. I really wished Richard is an a*s*shole so Superman and Lois can be together. This is however not so. Richard is a human Superman. He and Lois saved Superman! I liked how they make Richard reaching faster than Superman to save Lois first. It shows to us that Superman has too many responsibilities and lives to save. And Superman is not selfish, not only thinking of saving his love Lois. I'm looking forward to what happens between them in the sequels. <br /> <br />We all know that the biggest twist in the film is that Superman has a kid. I had my doubts about this earlier on but Bryan and the writers have played it really well. It really worked. Jason comes across as really cute. The last scene with Superman talking to his son is amazing. <br /> <br />Acting: <br /> <br />~ Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark/Kal-El <br />For a movie debut, Brandon is really impressive. He managed to separate the character into 3 different characters. I loved his Superman, adored his Clark and sympathise his Kal-El. Brandon as Superman is really powerful, solid, selfless and fearless. Although being hurt by kryptonite, he still uses his whole strength to save the world. This is official. Brandon is my Superman. I do not see any Christopher Reeve in Brandon's portrayal of Superman. As for Clark, I can swear that certain mannerisms and poses is really the exact spitting image of Chris' Clark. I adore Clark alot, clumsy and cute. If not for how he differentiates the 2 characters, audiences would've felt Clark Kent = Superman. But I could really see them as really different people. Excellent. As for Kal-El on farm which is the real Superman, you can see he really ain't that happy. He has huge responsibilities to fill, i actually sympathise with him as he has to sacrifice alot for the world. <br /> <br />~ Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane <br />This is the first time I'm catching Kate's performance. Her Lois is entirely different from Margot's Lois. She may look young for a mother of 5, but she acts really well. And I loved how she didn't smoke in the film (and how Supes and Richard disallowing her to smoke) because one thing i didn't like was Margot's Lois smoking in the film. I had doubts about Kate initially but she won me over. <br /> <br />~ Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor <br />Needless to say, Kevin is perfect as Lex. I finally have my Lex. He's evil and selfish, and not campy. <br /> <br />~ Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen <br />Sam is really funny as Jimmy. He definitely steals alot of the show away when he's on. I also liked how he is the only one who really adores Clark (the others doesn't really care much about Clark). Another good casting choice. <br /> <br />~ Others <br />Parker Posey did her part well, and i loved how she threw away the crystals, showing she is actually not a bad person. Not alot of Martha scenes, but the first ones with Clark was great. <br /> <br />Visual Effects: <br /> <br />Stunning visual effects indeed. After Superman saved the 777 jet, it tells us Superman is back. Someone sitting to the left of us clapped. I seldom see this happen. It was obvious he was stunned by the great visual effects and Superman's return. However, visual effects were not perfect in this movie. Still could see glitches.Some scenes were quite obvious that it's CGI. That's probably my only complaint of the film. But apart from that, the effects are really good. <br /> <br />Soundtrack: <br /> <br />John Ottman is a genious. He managed to use John Williams score and compiled into his own score as well. His score is magnificent and emotional. It really helps to create the visuals as well. <br /> <br />Final thoughts: <br /> <br />Superman has returned. I can't wait for more films. Though the film is not perfect, it is really really good. I loved and adored it. there are quite a number of homages to the donner films as well which is nice.
B00004YWAG|5.0|This is a wonderful pot-pourri of European music from the first half of the sixteenth century - reflecting the pan-European origins of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. One of the chief delights of the disc is the consort singing of the male voices of La Capella Real. Savall now uses male altos in the vocal pieces by Enzina (and others) in the upper registers, rather than female sopranos (principally that of his wife, Montserrat Figueras) as he did in his 90's recordings with Astree. The results are perfect; altos Carlos Mena and Pascal Bertain make an abiding impression here, with Capella regular Danile Carnovich holding up the bass clef. Figueras takes the cantus in the monophonic 'ballad' pieces, and is still matchless in this kind of music. The winds of La Capella are a joy to hear - listen to the Susato Battaglia, and the Anonymous La Spagna. <br />In short, this is an echanting survey of the secular and religious music of 16th century Europe, imaginatively presented and beautifuly performed and recorded. A must - and a fine companion to Savall's life of Isablle I of Spain, also from Alia Vox.
B00006LLNU|5.0|<br />I say be careful with this album, only because of how emotionally powerful it is.  I can honestly say that out of any album I have ever heard in my life, this album is the most thought provoking, and provides the strongest emotional punch of anything in the category of music out there. <br /> <br />Some might say its depressing, some might say that its beautiful, but really its a mix.  The entire album presents a rather melancholy atmosphere for its listeners.   But dont let that turn you off, unless thats just not your thing.  I love it when a band can move me emotionally, that shows to me that they've done their job, because really when you think about it, all music is a form of some exerted emotion.   <br /> <br />So with that established, the album is just awesome.  Its really one of those things that you would consider \\"genious\\"    There are no actual lyrics, no english or icelandic, (thats where they're from)  and there is no track listing, everything is untitled.   <br /> <br />Like I said in the begginning, this album is extremely powerful.  Although its rather reserved and mellow, it provides us with extreme emotions, and that can be risky for people that are highly emotional.    <br />Supposedly people have killed themselves while listening to the album.   ??   <br /> <br />Well Im somewhat of an emotional person, and I have yet to contemplate suicide over this album.    Its depressing/melancholy quality is just a contributor to its over all awesomeness.      <br /> <br />If you are patient, and allow it to soak in, then I promise after a few listenings you will be hooked.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Music is interesting because it comes in so many different forms.  It seems that recently people are mostly satisified with tunes that grab their heart on the very listen.  Amnesiac, similiarly to many other Radiohead albums, does not work that way.   <br /> <br />They are so obscure and strange that you have no choice but to give it time.  I first listened to this album and couldnt decide what I thought about it.  Then I listened to it a second and third time, and began to discover the amazing inconspicuos qualities to this music.   <br /> <br />The album is awesome.  The wierdness within each song has some sort of hook or catch to it that reels you in.  After a few listenings you'll become familiar with the structure of each song, and begin to fall in love with it.   <br /> <br />Heres a rating of each song: <br /> <br />1. Packed like sardines in a crushed tin box.  10/10.   Probably one of my favorites on the album.  Thome Yorks melodies in this song are catchy in their own wierd way.  Great song <br /> <br />2. Pyramid Song:  8/10.   Most people would rate this song a 10.. but I give it an 8 just because I didnt like it as much as \\"Packed like sardines...\\"   Nonetheless this song still rocks.   <br /> <br />3. You and Whos Army:  9/10.  The first half of this song is pretty good.. but then after a minute or so it gets incredible.  This is also one of my favorite tracks.   <br /> <br />4. Knives Out.  8/10.  Most people adore this song, just like the Pyramid song.  I think its pretty good, but I dont adore it.  But I do like it.   <br /> <br />5. I might be wrong:  9/10.   Awesome guitar riff.. has a great dark feel to it.  I love this song.  <br /> <br />6. Dollars and Cents:  9/10.  Wonderfully depressing.  Most of the album has a great melancholy feel to it.. but this song probably hits it the hardest.   <br /> <br />7. Pulk/Pull revolving doors:  8/10.  Strangest on the album.   <br /> <br />8. Hunting Bears:  7/10.  I like this song.. but its just really short.  Supposedly this was improvised while they recorded it.  <br /> <br />9. Like Spinning Plates:  10/10.   Amazing.  Again his melodies hit the mark perfectly. <br /> <br />10. Life in a Glass House:  10/10.  Awesome song.. all horned intsruments.  Great track  <br /> <br />Overall the album is one truely one of their best.  <br /> <br />Music sometimes just takes patience in order to become interested with what it has to offer us.   Amnesiac retains such a wonderfully mysterious quality about it.... just like Kid A and Ok Computer do.   It takes a level of musical appreciation and maturity to fall in love with this album, but I promise you, if you are open to strange rock and you are patient.. then you will like it.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|The Strokes have done better than this, so I have to say I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />I don't think this is the end of their carreer though. Every artist has to fall if they're going to rise.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I adore this collection of Fleetwood Mac's work. Rhiannon is my all time favorite. It is so beautiful. The songs sung by Stevie Nicks are the most beautiful, since her voice is spellbinding.<br /><br />I reccomend this to every age group! It's fabulous!
B00000F0D1|5.0|This movie is a pure classic. There really isn't much more to say. It has excellent acting, and edge-of-your-seat story, AND it's based on a book by Stephen King. What more could you ask for? Kathy Bates plays her character to its fullest. While she starts out as an excentric heroine, she gradually becomes one of the most terrifying beings ever to grace the screen. At times, you almost have to question whether she is insane, or just depraved and sadistic. Her self-invented slang is so hilarious, it'll have you quoting it for life.  <br /> <br />The most eerie thing about this movie is how every act of evil performed by Bates is (in her mind) an act of love. She really cares for her \\"special guest\\", and wants him to feel the same way. That's all she really wants. One thing that really freaked me out is that at the same time that I rented this movie, I rented \\"Diary of a Mad Black Woman.\\" There is a reference to this movie's most frightening sequences. (Please keep in mind that I do not recommend \\"Diary\\". It was one of the most boring and pointless movies I have ever seen.)
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Like \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\", this was another little gem that others were talking about, but I was slow to catch up on. Thanks to my discovery of \\"On Demand\\", I found it!. I have to say that I am usually not drawn to British films, or zombie films(with some exceptions), so I never paid much attention to this film. Then the word got out. Having now seen it, the word is right. This movie is a funny, gory blast from start to finish. It has all the zombie cliches in there, and it has a heck of a time having fun with it all. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a clerk at a store selling refrigerators and such. His life is a bit of a mess. He is having relationship issues with his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield), his roomates, and his stepfather Phillip(Bill Nighy). But soon, the area is overtaken by zombies. The dead are rising and attacking the living. Get bit, and it's only a matter of time. What's really brilliant about the film is how the script just has all these zombie things popping up in the background and all around Shaun, while our hapless hero just goes on with life as if nothing is going on. It's wonderfully conceived and sharply directed. Before long, Shaun and his friend Ed(Nick Frost), are getting everyone together and battling the zombies to stay alive. Shoot them in the head!. Yes, you are treated to head explosions, and brains splattering here and there. Gotta love it. The movie is also very funny. What was surprising to me, was that the humor was also kind of American as well. The cast itself is up for the fun, and Pegg makes Shaun very likeable and relatable. Nick Frost's Ed is the overgrown college friend 10 years later who never leaves. Nighy is a superb actor(and he's great as Davy Jones in the new \\"Pirates\\" movie), and he makes the most of his role here as Shaun's stepfather. I wished there was more of him. The movie doesn't really have any huge social significance like the zombie films of George Romero, but it celebrates all the fun of the zombie movie, with having nice humor along for the ride. Some fans don't like the mix, but it works like gangbusters here. Who else can resist our band of heroes fighting the zombies with Queen blaring on the jukebox?. So, what exactly is the plot with the zombies?. Not much. They gave some reason, but really, it's a passing thought. It's all about the gore, the head smacks, the humor, and the notion of this extraordinary thing happening to ordinary people with extra ordinary lives.
1573223026|2.0|I have really loved all of Nick Hornby's novels. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about \\"High Fidelity\\" was the very English style of speaking used by the characters. Hornby's storytelling is so visual to me, I can really see the characters come to life, better than many modern writers. I don't know what he was trying to do in \\"A Long Way Down\\". The subject matter of suicide didn't necessarily bother me, but each chapter was written from the perspective of a different character, which absolutely blew any flow in the story. I found myself constsantly trying to figure out who was who, and who was narrating during this minute. It's too bad Nick Hornby tried to come up with a new and creative way of telling a story, which did not work, as he is so good at what he does.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This movie isn't just for one kind of audience, I think any kind of person would appreciate this amazing film. \\"Bound\\" is full of everything that I believe makes a film great: Money, sex, violence, danger, and women who rock. After I put it into my DVD player, I was hooked. <br /> <br />Corky (Gershon) has moved into the appartment building to do some work. Ceasar and the gorgeous Violet (Tilly) also live in this building, down the hall. They are involved with the Mob, but Violet wants out. After a heated sexual encounter between Corky and Violet, they plot out to do the unthinkable: steal $2 million that belongs to the mob.  <br /> <br />The night that they put their plan into action, things go right one minute then wrong the next. Violet is very bad a** as she plays along, acting as if she is on Ceasar's side the entire time, just to get away with $2 million. The plot makes you keep hoping and praying that Corky and Violet make it out alive and not caught. <br /> <br />As the night continues and the mob gets closer to collect their money, the final showdown occurs and it's such a shock to see what happens. This movie was never too predictable, I never knew what was going to happen and I loved being surprised. What is Ceasar going to do when he finds out $2 million of the mob's money is gone? Especially when he was responsible for the cash? Does he find out that his beautiful Violet is behind it all? <br /> <br />The actor's preformances were amazing. The stunning Jennifer Tilly took my breath away with her voice and her body. I've came to love this movie without even knowing anything about the mob, without even liking action or anything. I think this movie is for everyone. <br />

B000001Y2U|5.0|Well, I think Manson is brilliant on many fronts - musically, intellectually, and marketing-wise. But many will agree with me that this is a must-have album.  Very bitter, yet sensitive and teetering  between varying degrees of harshness.  Start to finish the tracks are beautifully entwined and it finishes with one of - in my opinions - Manson's best songs ever. <br />The album is more polished than previous albums but not as poppy as some of Manson's later works.  In my opinion, this is one of the most influential albums of the 90's, and also set the precedent for Manson as not only a name, but - as his band farcically mimics - an American icon.
0553804677|4.0|This is caper fiction at its finest, with something for just about everybody: Lies. Con games. Fantasy. Mystery. Sword fights. Impossible odds. Unbreakable friendships with all-too-breakable hearts. Honor. Betrayal. Revenge.  <br /> <br />The cons dreamed up by the title character are as notable for their ingenuity as for how often they go horribly wrong. But in the end this is more than the story of a con artist, it's a story of brotherhood and honor among thieves. The author's world-building is vivid and lush, and his characters have you rooting for them despite their somewhat lax morals. Granted, they sometimes feel like they were sent over from Central Casting--\\"Hey, gimme a Fagin, an Artful Dodger and a couple of Musketeers!\\"--but they're no less lovable for it. <br /> <br />If I have one complaint, it's that female characters are given short shrift in this novel. A love interest for Locke is hinted at but never seen, and all of Locke's partners in crime are men--this despite how handy it would be for a gang of thieves and con men to have a woman to play certain roles in their deceptions. But that's a small quibble, and given the aforementioned hints, I am confident Locke will meet his feminine match in a sequel.

0224071262|5.0|One reviewer said that \\"First of all, in the days before Mao's rise to the top, the CCP disciplined Mao on several occasions precisely because he often used passive aggressive tactics to avoid carrying out CCP directives (from Moscow) because he believed these were unsuitable for conditions in China.\\" <br /> <br />It is not true. For example, in 1931, Mao was \\"disciplined\\" by XIANG Ying for killing too many \\"AB Group\\" members. <br />Later, XIANG was sacked by WANG Ming, who was a party leader appointed by Moscow. <br /> <br />It seems that the knowledge of the author of this piece of comments were completely copied from CCP. <br /> <br />Mao was definitely a stooge of Stalin. In his own words: \\"Stalin is my big boss\\", \\"we obey the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\\" (see, e.g., People's Daily, Aug. 14, 2004 and Liu ShaoQi Wen Ji). On the founding day of the so called \\"People's Republic of China\\", Mao gave up 170000 Square KM territory, namely Tannu Uriankhai, to his \\"big boss\\".
B00006F83Y|5.0|It's too easy to typecast any band, the least of which includes Queens of the Stone Age.  Their brand of repetitive mulitlayered guitar riffs and a penchant for clever if not puzzling lyrics set them apart from the clones they delightfully tear apart at the opening of the CD.<br /><br />  The closest band you can compare the Queens to besides Kyuss, which is guitarist/vocalist Josh Hommes' first outfit is probably (and this is a loose connection) \\"Tyranny and Mutation\\"-era Blue Oyster Cult.  Check out the opening salvo of \\"The Red And The Black\\" and the closer, the heavy-as-it-is-mysterious \\"Mistress Of The Salmon Salt (Quicklime Girl)\\" to see what I mean.  I betcha the Queens wore out the grooves on this masterpiece.<br /><br />  We get soft vocals over droning guitars in \\"Hanging Tree\\", harmonies over brutal chords in \\"The Sky Is Falling\\", and a nifty reference to \\"Spirits In The Sky\\" with \\"God Is In The Radio\\".<br /><br />  Queens of the Stone Age understand hooks and riffs better than any counterpart.  They studied their Sabbath and the aforementioned BOC lessons well and turned those influences into something fresh, innovative and ultra heavy, the way this brand of rock should be.
6305633177|4.0|I first saw this DVD when my boyfriend brought it over to my house. I loved the concert footage in this dvd, since it was filmed when Metallica was still a thrash band. There is concert footage, some of it shows Cliff doing bass solos. There is also a scene where a women is interviewing the band and asks them about their influences. One scene also is a performance while Dave Mustaine was still in the band. There are some scenes that just show the band drinking and having a good old time. Great dvd, although several scenes dont even have cliff in them. A must have for the diehard Metallica/ Cliff Burton fan!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|In a film world were there seems to be a great deal of lacking high sea/historical maritime adventure, \\"Master and Commander\\" is highly welcomed.  I was lucky enough to sail on the schooner Appledore IV during the tall ships festival 2003.  During this experience I developed a huge passion for maritime history.  My dream is to someday sail aboard a 19th or 18th century man o war.  Who knows maybe one day?  Later that year \\"Master and Commander was released in the theater and I was burning with anticipation.  I was not let down at all.  This movie had it all, action, drama, intrigue, pain, fear, excitement, and true friendship.  All these aspects would have been found on an English Man O War during the Napoleonic Wars.<br /><br />The film was purely fiction, based on Patrick O Brian's books, but as far as presenting what life was like on a warship for the English crown during 1805 it was dead on.  The uniforms, the language, and sailing techniques were nearly perfect.  Although the film is a fictional story it is presented historically enough that it could have easily happen.  Granted Hollywood added a little flare, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I was getting a little tired of the classic pirate movie and was wanting more from Hollywood in the maritime department.  Do not get me wrong I think the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a fantastic time.  Moreover, I do have \\"The Curse of the Black Pearl\\" to thank for bringing back maritime adventure.  If it weren't for that particular film \\"Master and Commander\\" would not have had nearly the draw it did.  But with that being said, I was very enthused to see a nautical film with a lot more history than fantasy.<br /><br />With all that has to be said about Russell Crowe, one cannot deny that he is an amazing actor.  He really envelops himself in every character he plays.  He actually made himself learn how to play the fiddle so it would be more authentic during the scenes he had to play.  Crowe was extremely believable as Captain Jack Aubery, although he was a bit more laid back than most British Captains of the early 19th century.  He would have been defiantly a captain I would have wanted to crew under.  I must also admit I have never read any of Patrick O Brian's books, something really need to do. So I cannot compare the two.  But for a film that represents life in the British navy during 1805 it did fantastic job.  I yearn for more films like this.  Who knows maybe one day I'll get that film about Lord Admiral Nelson I have always wanted to see.  Huzzah!ck Aubery, although he was a bit more laid back than most British Captains of the early 19th century.  He would have been defiantly a captain I would have wanted to crew under.

B000002H6C|4.0|This was Metallica's last thrash album before they went commercial and more mainstream. I think this is a very heavy album and has great crunchy riffs. Awesome songs on this cd are \\"The Shortest Straw,\\" obviously, \\"One,\\" \\"Eye Of The Beholder,\\" and \\"Blackened.\\" Songs on this album are extremely long some going to over 9 minutes. This was also their first album without cliff Burton, when Jason Newstead joined the band.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|So I listened to this CD earlier today. Before I got out of bed actually...we're on vacation, I picked it up yesterday. This disc not only has KsE, Caliban, etc. type lyrics. That's what you all seem to be degrading it with. Phil has range in both core and soft styles. Just listen to say...The Weak Willed, or Six, and you'll hear your core, death, black, minimal sing, and Six Feet Under type vocals all in one song. This cd has variety. Oli and Mike are exceptional guitarists and definitly rank up there with Donais and Bachand in todays metal scene. You may ask? What about Matt and Corey of Trivium? Sorry folks, Yes, they are great, but I do believe that Donais, Bachand, Herbet, and Martin all excede both of them. NO disrespect to Trivium...you are excellent musicians, all of you. You're definitely one of my favorite bands. But the four I just mentioned almost always are creating chaos with their fret hands. It's truly amazing. Anyway, This album is downright ferocious. Probably the best of 06 in my book so far, Awaiting Unearth, Trivium, and SF's major label debut. But this cd has it all. Breakdowns, Solos, Acoustics, Double Bass, Blast Beats, and the vocal styles I listed earlier. This is truly the first metal masterpiece of the year of 2006. Well, of what I've heard so far. Anyway, I did not come across a single boring part of this cd this morning. Why? The variety of course. They're not staying to the same riff over and over again, or the same speed. It's move, switch, switch, switch. Downright chaos...which is basically Metal in my book. Chaos is beautiful. And to think that a band can create it with music is amazing. I thank All That Remains for blessing us with this great album in the middle of all the mediocre metalcore releases out today. Yes, I like metacore, but palm mute after palm mute gets boring. Expand your narrow mind past the singing and learn to appreciate this album for what it truly is. Chaos. Beautiful Chaos
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Latin-based international pop diva Shakira sets speakers on fire with her latest (though oddly-named) offering Oral Fixation Vol. 2.  Her smash \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" is, of course, the standout track here, but surprisingly most of the remainder is consistent and well-written, well-performed and well-produced.  Of course, it's not perfect, but it's definitely worth listening to for its Latin-influenced English music performed in the unique vocals of one of the industry's most talented singer-songwriters.
B00008WT5C|4.0|And even at its worst, it still beats crappy latter-day albums such as Flick of the Switch!<br /><br />1. Go Down: 6.5/10. Bleah. Nothing too memorable, but not bad either.<br /><br />2. Dog Eat Dog: 6/10. See Go Down.<br /><br />3. Let There Be Rock: 10/10. Bon Scott proves why Brian Johnson will never truly replace him. His lyrics, about the \\"birth\\" of rock, are hilarious. Sure, the Young brothers throw out riff after riff, but in the end, this is the Bon Scott show.<br /><br />4. Bad Boy Boogie: 10/10. AC/DC's version of the classic blues rave-up tune, and it works very well. One of their most underrated tunes.<br /><br />5. Problem Child: 7.5/10. I don't see why this song was recylced from Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. I mean, back when this came out it made sense because Dirty Deeds wasn't released in the US until '81, but why not replace it with Crabsody in Blue, the song it replaced? That said, it's still a good song, and for whatever reason sounds better here than on Dirty Deeds.<br /><br />6. Overdose: 5.5/10. Overdose, you are the Weakest Link. Goodbye!<br /><br />7. Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be: 10/10. A solid rocker, with a bad reputation it doesn't deserve. It's not about Satanism (AC/DC actually wasn't Satanic), but about a bad relationship and how, in Bon Scott's eyes at least, it's better than no relationship at all.<br /><br />8. Whole Lotta Rosie: 10/10. One of AC/DC's most famous songs, a dirty rocker based on one of Bon Scott's real-life groupies. This song rocks in every sense of the word (a bad joke, I know) and is one of AC/DC's greatest-ever tunes.<br /><br />Overall: 8.19. AC/DC's breakthrough, not quite at the level of Back in Black, Highway to Hell or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap but still a good listen.

Why was it cancelled? The whole series are great.  I hope someone in Hollywood reads all the reviews on this [...].
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I think the movie did a pretty decent job for silent hill though i never really played the games but i know  some of it from my friends, im sposed to but just on my opinion they could have gone in more depth into silent hills story line and a longer movie. i think they should have been more into the game then what it was originaly. dont get me wrong i like the movie i saw it twice with friends but they never liked it period. i do think they did a pretty good job making a movie about a game then alot of others usly alot of people have screwed  <br />movie based games up really like what \\"Uwe Boll\\" does he just blows every movie based game in lil bits, but i think you should rent this 1st but if your a fan and you already loved it then go nuts :)
B000066NW0|4.0|\\"Let Go\\" is Avril Lavigne's debut album.  (She was only about 18 years old at the time).  I would have to classify this as a rock album as opposed to punk rock (though there are touches of pop and metal).    Avril Lavigne's style is very casual and catchy, and most of these tracks are good, straight-forward, easy-to-sing-along-with songs.  The album features what is by far Avril Lavigne's most famous song, \\"Complicated,\\" as well as the other singles \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" \\"I'm With You,\\" and \\"Losing Grip.\\"  As a whole, it is a very listenable album with a nice variety of musical flavor.  I think that anyone who likes casual rock or pop rock music, especially young ladies, will probably like it.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|Get one thing straight at the outset: you will probably need to either watch this film a few times or read an in depth summary of all the characters, relations and events in the movie /before/ watching it or you will have a very difficult time piecing it all together. There are just too many characters and too many subtle relationships-- ie. relationships whose precise nature must be ascertained by careful attention to dialogue between all the characters-- for the average person to take it all in on one sitting. This is not a sleight on the movie; this film aimed to paint a realistic picture of the world's current political landscape and how so much of it revolves around oil. Since the film aimed to paint a /realistic/ picture, and not simply pump out a Hollywood extravaganza, many of the movie's key events are not heralded by big explosions or other drama, but rather they take the form of backroom conversations and handshakes whose full import and significance can be missed if one doesn't catch all the relevant details. That being said, what the movie set out to do, it did very well-- I was engaged and interested throughout the entire film.<br />&lt;lj-cut><br />For those of you who have long suspected that:<br /><br />1) the major tide of events in the world are, to a large degree, controlled by rich old men in suits whose /only aim/ is to become richer and to ensure that their way of life and the power structure that supports it will continue to thrive-- at whatever expense,<br /><br />2) many people in high places have indeed tried to instigate changes for the betterment of the earth and its people contrary to the financial interests the rich elite, and that these same people have been crushed and vanquished by that same elite, who will have none of it,<br /><br />3) this whole \\"us vs. them\\" picture that gets painted by the media between Arab nations and the West is grossly misleading and that our true enemies are not faceless terrorists in other lands, but rather those in the corporate and government headquarters of /all lands/ who will sacrifice the well being of all on the altar of their immediate profit,<br /><br />4) our society is hopelessly addicted to oil and this addiction is currently the biggest shaper of world events out there,<br /><br />5) the average person in an Arab country is just like an average person in America-- an individual soul complete with hopes, fears, ideals and dreams who is, for the most part, totally unaware of, and completely detached from, what is going on in the upper echelons of their society,<br /><br />this movie will serve to strengthen those suspicions and it will do it in a way that is both balanced and believable. Does it offer any solutions? Not really-- but I don't think that was its aim, which was simply to give us a picture of how things actually are, contrary to what is often conveyed in the media. No, the US is not in the Middle East in the name of democracy (does anyone actually believe that they are?)-- they are there to keep their fingers in the world's largest remaining oil supply /in order that our way of life will be preserved/. That's a point that is pretty easy to overlook-- too many people are hypercriticial of the US governemnt's \\"true\\" motivation for being in the Middle East and yet will fail to reflect on that significance as they hop into their SUV and drive to work. Our entire society would cease to function as it does now if we suddenly lost access to liberal supplies of Middle Eastern oil. Secondly, no, the Arabs are not simply a population of terrorists but are humans just like us who are caught up in this great world drama that /we all/ ultimately shape and determine. If there is a greater incidence of terrorism over there it is simply because it is closer in proximity to where everything is happening. Many of these \\"terrorist attacks\\" are instigated by the same frustrations that many of us feel when we reflect on the degree to which greedy businessmen and politicians mislead us all to satisfy their own lusts for power and money. I found it easy to sympathize with a group of youth in this movie who felt compelled to violence as they watched their country being sold off to the highest bidder simply due to the greed of those in charge.<br /><br />One of the things I really appreciated about this film was how, contra current trends in the media, it painted Arab youth, not simply as a group of \\"terrorists in training\\" but rather as a very human group of kids who are just like us westerners-- they sneak out with their friends to get drunk, they talk about girls and sex, they have ideals about the world and are disappointed with how things are turning out. Yes, some of them get swept up into terrorist movements, but lets put that in perspective. We have everything here-- if all of our oppulence were suddently taken from us and given to some other country who proceded to squander and waste it, is it not reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of angry people here who would soon resort to some rather drastic acts of protest? I don't find that hard to believe at all. This, now that I think of it, might have been the central message of this movie. We're all in this, that is to say, sharing this planet, together. It's wrong and dangerous to create these arbitrary divisions between Arabs and Westerners-- as there are good, idealistic souls in both lands. What we really need to worry about is the degree to which the rich and powerful control the tide of world events to suit their own individual interests and the degree to which we, as a world citizenry, are hopelessly addicted to a form of energy that will one day run out.for power and money.

B000062XGG|4.0|Damn, it's tough to be a purist. You're passionate about what you like, but you're always finding someone compromising the object of your zeal to make a buck, and it pisses you off. <br /> <br />It's akin to being part of the base of support for your favorite politician - you're part of the cadre of true believers - and then becoming angry when he or she strays from cherished core principles to troll for votes. <br /> <br />The sad fact is there are never enough purists to sustain any cause, no matter how well-intentioned.  I know - I'm a hard-core baseball fan who hates furry mascots, the \\"lets-make-some noise\\" exhortations, baseballs that race across the Jumbotron as fans cheer their \\"favorite\\" and the animated clapping hands prevalent at most major league ballparks. But I also understand that baseball's a business and franchises have no choice but to try these ancillary gimmicks to attract casual fans. Hey, maybe they'll notice the actual contest on the field. <br /> <br />Lest we all forget folks, ID4 is a product of the business of Hollywood. I get the sense that many of the one-star reviews of ID4 are coming from the sci-fi purists who expected the second coming of War of the Worlds. <br /> <br />Wasn't gonna happen. ID4 was an unabashed for-the-masses production. Thin plot? One-dimensional characters? Lots of pyrotechnical special effects? Of freaking course! I'm not a sci-fi fan. I don't particularly care for most of the dreck Hollywood puts out. But I happened to enjoy this flick immensely, and I consider myself someone with an IQ far above plant life. <br /> <br />Why do I love ID4? Because I chose to view the aliens featured in ID4 as products of an omnipotent, all-knowing God imaginative enough to create something traveling through this thing we call the universe that looks or acts like nothing humanity has ever seen. And more importantly, how humanity would react.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|First of all, I have been playing this record a lot in order to avoid falling in the \\"Exciter\\" trap, which on first sight seemed to be a cool album, but on the other hand started to be a pretty boring one after a while. With \\"Playing the angel\\" things seem to be pretty different, not that we have a new \\"Violator\\" but at least they got rid of the click and cut sound that was for sure the least innovating aspect in the band's entire career and they tweaked the sound into an overall very dark pot making you remind the days of SOFAD and \\"Violator\\" for the feeling alone. And lucky us, there are at least 4 tracks that stand out and make it worth already having the album. First off, the very rocky electro gospel track \\"John the revelator\\" (thank god they left the female backing vocalists at home) that will be the number 1 live hit beating the boring \\"Condemnation\\" with miles. Excellent. Next is the leaked single \\"Precious\\" which brings the Mode close to \\"It's no good\\" thanks to attractive vocals and a damn catchy tune that swings in your head easily. Next is the Dave Gahan penned track \\"Nothing's impossible\\", very Depeche Mode unlike but damn, what a brilliant song with that early industrial feeling going through it. I have to recall my comments on the songwriting skills of Gahan... The 4th winner and by far the best song in years from Depeche is \\"Lilian\\", lovely vocal lines powered by clean and yet distorted synth layers. For me one of the most surprising tracks since I heard \\"Personal Jesus\\". There are some less good aspects as well though minor ones, tracks such as the opener (and also next single) \\"A pain that I'm used to\\" that is ruined by this awfull \\"Dead of night\\" guitar sampling, the Gore sung \\"Macro\\" that is so slick it makes me kinda nauseate. But the final count is obviously very positive, something I feared for, but they are back after a few years of dwelling around, targetless.
0671799320|3.0|This book is biased on the side of the oil companies and USA, UK foreign policy while depicting leaders in the middle east as clowns. A thick book, but doesn't say much. Read William Engdahl's \\"A Century of War\\" for a more informative read.
B000002J09|5.0|This was the last Led Zeppelin Lp I purchased as a teenager who grew up when this music was being made.  My band played many of the songs on this record including the frequently lampooned Stairway to Heaven.  I got sick of friends asking me to play this Lp and one day I handed it to the person asking and said \\"here, keep it!  please!\\"  I went off and became something of a jazz snob.<br /><br />I hadn't heard the music on this disc in at least 30 years and then, after discovering the incredible Terry Reid, who had turned down the singing job that eventually went to Plant, I got curious about my hazey memory. After reading about Reid and his near miss with Zeppelin I started revisiting Led Zeppelin one disc at a time - see my other Zeppelin reviews.<br /><br />The music on this CD is really fantastic, every single track is brilliant.  I especially love The Battle of Evermore because it features the incredible voice of the late Sandy Denny who could warm your heart like a winter hearth or turn it to ice with a banshee moan.  What an amazing woman she was.<br /><br />It's kind of sad that Stairway to Heaven became so much fun to mock, it's such a wonderful piece of music and poetry.  Even Plant, in a Fresh Air interview, seems to have accepted the mockery (Hairway to Steven being his favorite) I must admit that I have vivid memories of working in a music store and got so fed up with kids coming in, pulling a guitar off the wall and playing the introduction.  This must have happened at least a half dozen times a day for a year or two.  We never had a \\"No Stairway to Heaven\\" sign but I wish I'd though of that!  I'm also eager to hear Zappa's band (The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life) cover Stairway.

I will tell you that I'm still an active musician who usually listens to the likes of Miles Davis and John Coltrane.  I find this and most of the other Zeppelin releases were remastered with loving care.  If you're picking up the Zeppelin catalog I would start here, then move on to Physical Graffiti, Led Zeppelin III, Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin I, and Houses of the Holy (in that order).  I know nothing about the final two releases and I'm a tad wary of them.  Surely Physical Graffiti was the pinnacle of this band's accomplishments anyway.<br /><br />This was an exceptional band with extremely talented players.  The Runes album ranges from hard-rocking to mystical beauty. Some how it all fits together beautifully, nothing seems out of place (unlike the next release Houses of the Holy where the band seemed to lack a consistent focus) Hearing the Runes album after 30 some years was almost like discovering it for the very first time again :)  What fun!

B00004XONN|5.0|When i was about 11 (now 17) i wanted to buy a cd, at the time the top 2 albums were Tool and Radiohead (amnesiac). i had no idea who either of them were, and ended up choosing Radiohead. Ever since then ive been hooked. The music on Kid A is haunting, unaccesible, and sometimes not even enjoyable to listen to, but it evokes emotions only bands to the likes of Sigur Ros, can produce.  <br /> <br />Everything in its Right Place- 10/10 this is one of my all time favorite songs, its incredible. <br /> <br />Kid A- 8/10 this song features computerized vocals, and music that take you to a different world, very calm and relaxing <br /> <br />The National Anthem- 9/10 Chaos at its finest, by the end of this song every instrument is playing something different and at first you may question why people think this is good music...and then it hits you <br /> <br />How to Disappear Completely- 10/10 beautiful, it blends elements from The Bends and OK Computer, to form one of the best songs on the album <br /> <br />Treefingers- 7/10 instrumental interlude, its nothing special,but its very ambient and mysterious <br /> <br />Optimistic- 10/10 the most accesible tune on the album, the closest thing to straight rock you'll find on this album, very good <br /> <br />In Limbo-8/10 not one of my favorites but it follows nicely behind optimistic <br /> <br />Idioteque- 10/10 wow, um, what can i say about this. its incredible, its chilling, its disorienting, and most of all its possibly the best song on the album. some may not get this song, others it will give you emotions youve never felt before.  <br /> <br />Morning Bell- 9/10 this is one of those haunting songs that doesnt go down smooth the first time (or few times) but it grows <br /> <br />Motion Picture Sountrack- 9/10 sad, joyous, slow, uplifting, a great way to end of of the best albums to be released in the past 10 years. <br /> <br />i read reviews all the time for radiohead, half of them praise the band for everything theyve done, and the other half are angry that people actually find something to like about radiohead. if you have a love for music, originality, art etc. you need to at least give this album a listen, its the least you can do, and if you dont like it, its your opinion. all i can say is that radiohead changed the way i listen to music, maybe they can do the same for you. <br /> <br />hopefully this helped a little for people still undecided on this album.
B000002J1U|5.0|This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.<br /><br />It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.<br /><br />There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard \\"wheel\\" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket.<br /><br />Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.<br /><br />Friends has nice \\"happy\\" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.<br /><br />Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.<br /><br />Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.<br /><br />Out on the Tiles is another rocker.<br /><br />Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.<br /><br />Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.<br /><br />That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.<br /><br />Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.<br /><br />Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people \\"in the know\\".<br /><br />All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.<br /><br />Buy this at once!cognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|This not the typical action flick you see those saturdays at night beacuse Micheal Mann has done the greatest action movies ever with his previous works like \\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\" are proofs why Mr.Mann is one the best action movie directors, Collateral is not one of those stupid non-sense action movies for exmaple the Jena Claude Van Dam and Steven Segal movies,Mann mixed perfectly action and dramtic scenes with excellent camera shoots and following the tradtion of directors with his choosen one actors like Martin Scorcese with Robert DeNiro & Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Spilberg with Tom Hanks & Tom Cruise,looks like Foxx is the new choosen one of Mann,apparently both are gonna work  togehter again for more movies like this type(i can't wait to see Miami Vice).<br /><br />The acting was excellent maybe not for an oscar but Tom Cruise,Jamie Foxx,Jada Pickett Smith and Mark Ruffalo handled they chacters very well,specially Tom Cruise who did a memoralble job as the bad guy and this great beacuse he finally do something different than his typical heroic chacters,Jamie Foxx also did a great job not so good as his role in \\"Ray\\" but he is still in the hollywood standars,Mark Ruffalo was great as always and Jada Pickett Smith did a good job too.<br /><br />The story has some pretty good twists but the ending is a little  predictable after some minutes of the movie,collateral doesn't has a totally original plot,is a decent basic plot no more no less.<br /><br />Story 8.5/10<br />Acting 10/10<br />Direction 10/10<br />Visuals 9.5/10<br /><br />Overall 10/10
B0000508U6|5.0|Lyrics and Mood are extremely important when considering songs! This is perhaps the best showcase of song writing since... When I hear this album I am saved-I realate it to the intensity of Schubert and the wit of Wolf. This is darn intelligent, thought provoking and praise worthy song literature!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I have long been a Neil Young fan. His music \\"rings home\\" to me. The music resonates as far back as the \\"Crosby,Stills,Nash, and Young\\" days. \\"Prairie Wind\\" is one of Young's best works. The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.    I purchased the CD and the \\"Heart of Gold\\" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to \\"Prairie Wind\\", I said, \\"Wow!\\". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, \\"Spectacular!\\". If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows, and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion, then these performances define success. As a son of the Prairie, I say \\"Five stars.\\" and \\"Two thumbs up!\\".
1594481938|2.0|I really enjoyed the movie High Fidelity so I was interested in reading some of Hornby.  This was the first book I picked up and I was disappointed.  I found the writing juvenile - almost as if it was a first novel written by a young adult. It was not especially compelling and I found I really didn't care much about the characters. <br /> <br />I will try again with one of Hornby's other books.
0143036556|4.0|Some people find satisfaction in writing ludicrous reviews, for whatever reason. Books about \\"godless liberals\\" and card games are ok, all the rest is plain rubbish. It's a bit sad to be craving for attention like this. Maybe it's not the book that's stupid...
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is a must see/must own in any collector's list, it's a Classic.

The pictures in review come from the special edition double sided DVD,with booklet inside and different box-artwork.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Much to the chagrin of iPod-happy, \\"fair use\\"-sad music listeners I will be buying this item for a 2nd time.    I'm utterly certain that every single MP3 listener is perfectly ethical and has never ripped off music artists by stealing their intellectual property.  Surely if this unspeakable act were to occur, we would soon be inundated with disposable and sickening bile in place of music.  One dimensional artists would emerge as best-sellers with chart-toppers designed by committee to move as many units in the first month as possible.  Who would care about repeated listening value?  After that time it would be easily downloadable for nothing.    That aside I lost this album recently.  I have been itching to hear it again.  That is the true measure of an album's worth.  It's an excellent, very solid album... great songwriting, but not an out & out classic.      **** - 4 stars    PLEASE NOTE:  My rating of it is uninfluenced by admittedly unscrupulous measures taken by record companies to protect their own rights in the face of rampant and unchecked theft by their consumer base.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|If you're a big Pink Floyd fan, then this DVD is worth having, but it has its problems.<br /><br />Visually it's all right, considering it was shot on 4:3 ratio video  quite a few years ago now (no wide-screen option). Sonically it's fine, if not spectacular.<br /><br />The song selection is good, with the idea of performing Dark Side in its entirety as the second half of the concert an interesting and effective ploy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me there are too many performance issues to make this a truly satisfying experience. A really good performance would have easily overcome the technical limitations and led me to give this at least 4 stars. However, much of the performance lacks inspiration, and at times borders on sloppy. Nick Mason's drumming seems rushed at times, though by the 2nd half he seems to get in gear and helps to solidify things. Gilmore's solos are generally well-executed, but often lack any real fire.<br /><br />Possibly the most damning thing for me personally, though, is the female vocals in \\"Great Big Gig in the Sky\\": it's my favorite track from Dark Side, but they basically destroy it in this version (especially the 3rd and last vocalist). There's also a bit of a breakdown in \\"Money\\", apparently also from the backup ladies getting a bit lost.<br /><br />All in all, it's still worth seeing (especially since there is not much else to choose from when it comes to PF DVDs), but don't expect to be blown away.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I still remember what i was doing when i first heard this album on my cd player, i was in the back of my uncle's van, headed from sac 2 la, and the song that wasnt being played enough(the real slim shady)was the song i was headed 2 but damn, i got stuck on Stan, cuz that track was and still is eminem's best track ever, anybody who has respect 4 rap, hip hop, or music in general likes that song, or can at least respect it. this album was dope, but coming off of The Real Slim Shady LP, i was a bit disapointed, but i understand that this was The Marshall Mathers LP, and it was clearly defirent, seeing as he wasnt slim shady i understood that the music was headed towards serios over funny, the album was dope lyricly, and the beats where kool, even em inpressed me, back when i was 14-15 i thought the whole album was produced by dre, but when i found out like 2 moths ago who did what i thought the way I Am was a hella good track, not knowing it was done by em, and the other good or great tracks are Bittch Please part2, all in all a good album, it could be great or a little worse depending on what eminem album u just came off of.
0790731894|4.0|The initial premise of the movie is simple enough: Arab terrorists are hijacking a plane.  Through an elaborate setup that allowed them to sneak guns and explosives onto the plane, the terrorists take charge of a plane that has a senator on board, and the most incredible flight attendants ever (Halle Berry is one of them), in order to get one of their terrorist brethren released from a prison of some sort.<br /><br />How will the Americans stop the plot?  This is where it gets thick.<br /><br />A Special Ops team led by Steven Seagal is going to fly on a stealth bomber to dock-up with a 747 where a specially designed sleeve, designed by Oliver Platt, who is some sort of genius in this movie, allows the good guys to surprise the bad guys.  Seagal's team is joined by a Middle East expert of some kind, Kurt Douglas, whose knowledge in these affairs is essential to the mission for whatever reason.<br /><br />The movie gives a quick shock to the viewers when, upon entry, the Special Ops team encounters some turbulence.  The guy who's supposed to defuse the bomb gets paralyzed, and the best surprise of all, Seagal dies.  Yes, it's a major disappointment in some ways because I wanted to see some arms get broken unnecessarily, but it helps the movie along in much more important way: the viewer doesn't have to suffer through Seagal's unbearable acting.  Additionally, it's hilarious because he gets chucked from a plane at 30,000 feet.<br /><br />What ensues is a race to move around the airplane without detection, defusing bombs and disarming terrorists.  Will they succeed?  Will they accomplish their goals before the President gives authorization to blow the plane filled with nerve agent out of the sky?<br /><br />It's an exciting enough movie with talented actors, tension, drama, and a mostly believable plot-line.  I enjoyed it and I recommend it as a late-night action fix.
B000AL730O|5.0|sure like many people in the 50+ catagory, i like the writings of paul and john from the beatle era. and he had some great pop songs with wings etc., but i haven't bought any music other than beatle from paul since \\"another day\\" in the early seventies. this is about to change though. after recently borrowing a copy of chaos and creation from the library i have decided to remedy the situation. <br />this is fine creation, is a tad beatlesque, to be sure, but this recording stands all by itself as one of the best pieces of songwriting to come out of the pop world in quite some time. especially worth hearing is the songs \\"jenny wren\\", and the very beautiful \\"too much rain\\", an ode to sadness. while many of his generation rehash their old glories, sir paul has indeed much more to give to anyone willing to invest in good music.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|\\"Oldboy\\" plays like a martial arts version of a Franz Kafka novel.  Dae-su Oh is a businessman in Korea who wakes up one day to find himself imprisoned in what appears to be a cheap hotel room from which he cannot escape (any time spent in a Motel 6 can elicit the same impression).  He doesn't know why he's there or who put him there, but he spends his fifteen-year-long \\"sentence\\" watching TV and perfecting his fighting skills, the better to exact revenge on those responsible when he finally gets out.  When that day comes, he sets out to unravel the mystery of his captivity, seeking out clues with the help of a sweet, sad young waitress he meets on his first day of freedom.<br /><br />\\"Oldboy\\" is an imaginative, high-energy film that keeps the viewer guessing right up to its final moments.  Shot through with dark humor, stylish directorial touches, and cartoon-style (albeit fairly graphic) violence, the film is deliberately disorienting in the beginning, the better to approximate the confused psychological state of its protagonist.  But eventually the plot points come fully into focus, and the film doesn't fall victim to that dreaded Third Act curse which has been the undoing of so many other mystery films of recent years.<br /><br />Fun stuff.
B00005JMK0|5.0|It is a story about a most unusual love triangle that involves  a guy, a girl & a computer. Lenny Von Dohlen is terrific as Miles. Virginia Madsen is lovely and so gorgeous as Madeline. Bud Cort is the voice of Edgar (The computer) and does a great job as well. <br /> <br />One of the strengths of the films is the performances of it stars and the relationships that exist between them. Both Lenny and Virginia bring a lot of heart into their roles which shows how much they care for each other and also makes it really easy to like them. Bud is really funny and naughty as Edgar, but you also occasionally get to see the side of Edgar that actually cares for Miles.  <br /> <br />Put simply it is a great \\"feel good\\" movie that you can watch over and over again. <br /> <br />The other strength of the film is the soundtrack. It features songs by Culture Club (Love is Love & The Dream), Jeff Lynne (Video & Let it Run), P P Arnold (Electric Dreams), Helen Terry (Now You're Mine), Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder (Together In Electric Dreams - my favourite). <br /> <br />One of my favourite movies of all time. I would buy this in a heartbeat if it were released on DVD and based on the amount of reviews listed so far, so would heaps of other people.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on \\"hell on earth\\" and \\"the infamous\\" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace.
0671027344|1.0|A high school friend recommended this book to me a few years back and I finally got around to reading it. Ugh! What a disappointment.  <br /> <br />My biggest beef with this book lies in the fact that the author tries too hard to be profound and wide-reaching instead of letting it be a simple story about high school existence. Within the first 50 pages, \\"Charlie,\\" the main character, confronts suicide, abortion, homosexuality, abuse, rape, drugs, alcohol, death and depression. One of these alone might have stood up, but all together it's just a little too much. (Think: \\"Rent\\") <br /> <br />What's worse is that sometimes these things are the focus of just one chapter and don't ever come up again. Suicide is mentioned then dropped. Abortion is mentioned and dropped. Rape is mentioned then dropped. It's as if Chbosky had a checklist while he was writing this to make sure every conceivable issue made an appearance. Had the author focused a bit, it could have been a much better book.   <br /> <br />I will concede there were a few \\"perks.\\" The book had some funny moments and there were times I found Charle relatable. However, in the end I didn't feel like the book took me anywhere. It could have ended 50 pages later or fifty pages sooner and I woudn't not have been able to tell the difference. <br /> <br />If you want a book from the perspective of a messed up teenager read \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Personally I feel even that book is over rated, but at least it's more honest than this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E8QVWY|1.0|I am utterly amazed at the number of people that think this is a good movie. Growing up in Texas, I was familiar with Johnny Cash's music from the very beginning, and, while I was never much of a C&W fan, it is very hard not to like Cash's music. This movie, however, it an insult to his memory, not an uncommon occurence in Hollywood; directors seem to love to trash people who cannot defend themselves. <br /> <br />In \\"Walk the Line\\", it's Cash who takes the worst hit. Phoenix plays him as if he were \\"mentally challenged\\", to use the PC parlance. If that were true, the man would never have suceeded as one of country music's greatest stars. Reese Witherspoon turns in an  admirable performance, but never convinced me that it was June Carter she was playing. <br /> <br />I had been waiting for this movie with a great deal of excitement; the reviews raved about it and June Carter Cash had become one of my favorite performers over the years, despite my overall boredom with country music. <br /> <br />When I saw it, however, it made me cringe with embarassment for the memories of Carter and Cash; even now, I cannot even think about \\"Walk the Line\\" without cringing. What a shame; the story of those two people is wonderful, too bad the movie wasn't.
1400079179|2.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a bit hard to quantify. On the one hand, it is a unique and fast opening thriller that had me flipping pages and dodging paper cuts right along with our unlikely heroes: American symbologist Robert Langdon and French cryptologist Sophie Neveu. But then, midway through the frantic adventure, a strange thing occurs. Our author, Dan Brown, pulls over the train and begins pouring the coal, not on the fire, but directly onto the passengers. This screeching halt occurs when grail expert Leigh Teabing makes his appearance and immediately begins suffocating readers beneath enough grail lore to qualify us all for PhDs.<br /><br />The plot eventually recovers, but not before many readers will have disembarked in search of more reliable service.<br /><br />I will give Dan Brown credit for the many puzzles that pop up; giving readers more to do than simply turn pages. However, the believability of the grail quest is often undermined by simple riddles that leave readers waiting pages for the novel's experts to catch up.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Da Vinci Code is a slightly below average read that could have been great if not for the author's endless push to convince readers of the veracity of his characters' beliefs. Even fictional arguments must stand on merit.  It is not enough to rely on overwelming the unsuspecting reader beneath an avalanche of print on the page.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|...in delight. <br />Let me start by saying that when my sister and mom came home raving about this play, the first thing that popped into my head was \\"overrated\\" and I thought they were going on and on just because they'd only seen it for the first time. So, I had no particular desire to see it. <br /> <br />I walked into my sister's room and she was playing \\"Popular.\\" At first listen, it was a nice little ditty, but she'd play it over and over, and I found myself wandering into her room more often. I fell in love with the song. <br /> <br />On Tuesday, I went to the play in Chicago with my family, and words can't even describe how much I love this show. The characters were terribly affecting, and, if it's possible, a few of the songs were even more so. <br /> <br />I realize the show is more of a Disney version of the book than it is accurate, but it doesn't bother me at all. It still conveys the emotion (more so than does the book, I think), and it is still very, very poignant. I deeply regret the fact that I don't live in New York, and as a result I didn't have a chance to see the original cast, but I love the show all the same. Almost every song is irreplaceable. <br /> <br />\\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" - 8/10. This is a great show-opener, and I love the opening chords both played and sung. It does get a bit mushy with Kristin Chenoweth's opera (though by no means am I putting her voice down), but otherwise provides an excellent introduction to the story. <br /> <br />\\"Dear Old Shiz\\" - 6/10. On the CD, it pretty much does nothing for me. However, I love the harmonies and the emphasized \\"zzzz\\" at the end, and being that it's so short, I see no reason to skip it. <br /> <br />\\"The Wizard and I\\" - 10/10. Idina Menzel shines on this song. Every time I listen to this song, I feel a pang of sadness when she starts to sing about the \\"celebration throughout Oz, that's all to do with me.\\" She's so optimistic in this song, and I can't help but be touched by it. <br /> <br/>\\"What Is This Feeling?\\" - 9/10. The only reason I'm not giving this a 10 is because this is a song that's a lot better live. It needs the physical interaction. Menzel and Chenoweth are both hysterical on this song, but this version (for me), leaves something to be desired. When I saw the show in Chicago, Kristy Cates (Elphaba) did a sort of a little Glinda-esque jig to mock her. That alone made me love the song. <br /> <br />\\"Something Bad\\" - 7/10. I like this song because it's important to the plot. But otherwise, it's not exceptional. <br /> <br />\\"Dancing Through Life\\" - 8/10. This song needs to be live to be appreciated. After just one listen, I wasn't impressed with Norbert Leo Butz's voice, but it grew on me. And I absolutely LOVE the little song with Boq and Nessarose. It's the reason I listen to the song. <br /> <br />\\"Popular\\" - 10/10. This was the first song I ever heard off the CD, so I can't help but love it. It's witty, it's funny, and at times, it's touching (when Elphaba says \\"I have to go\\"). <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not That Girl\\" - 9/10. If you're a teenage girl, be prepared to love this song. Be prepared to identify with it. Idina Menzel shows her versatility by singing this song, for it is the one song on the CD where she doesn't have an especially high or belt-worthy note. But it's touching and there are a couple of lines that I love. (\\"She who's winsome, she wins him\\" for one.) <br /> <br />\\"One Short Day\\" - 9/10. This is another song that benefits from a live performance. With that said, it's still fun to listen to on the CD. <br /> <br />\\"A Sentimental Man\\" - 9/10. I like this song. It's nothing extraordinary, but I like it all the same. <br /> <br />\\"Defying Gravity\\" - A million/10. This is, by far, the best song on the CD. Idina Menzel steals the show with this show-stopper. I get chills when I listen to this song, and even more of them when I think of the message behind this song. If you're looking for a really good \\"screw you\\" song, this is it. And it has amazing vocals to boot. <br /> <br />\\"Thank Goodness\\" - 9/10. This is a good Act II opener. It's funny, it's bittersweet, and it's fun to listen to. My only qualm is that there are some cheesy lines in here. Particularly when Kristin Chenoweth sings \\"There are bridges you crossed you didn't know you crossed until you crossed.\\" That's too many uses of the word \\"crossed\\" in one sentence for me. <br /> <br />\\"Wonderful\\" - 9/10. I like this song for the lyrics and Joel Grey's voice. I wish he had more songs on the CD, but hey, beggars can't be choosers. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\\" - 7/10. It's a good song in that it gives you a feeling for the true depth of Glinda's emotions. It's not even a minute, so it's not really that much of a song anyway, but it's a nice lead-in to \\"As Long As You're Mine.\\" <br /> <br />\\"As Long As You're Mine\\" - 10/10. This is a song that grew on me. At first, it was a bit too poppy for me, but it has emotion. I like Norbert Leo Butz's voice a lot better in this song than in \\"Dancing\\" and I think he sounds great with Idina Menzel. <br /> <br />\\"No Good Deed\\" - 10/10. This is probably one of the most heart-wrenching songs on the whole CD. We all feel for Elphaba when she finally decides to become wicked, and my heart breaks every time she screams Fiyero's name. There is so much raw emotion in this song that it's hard not to love it. <br /> <br />\\"March of the Witch Hunters\\" - 7/10. It's an okay song. Not one of the better ones, but it makes you root for Elphaba even more. <br /> <br />\\"For Good\\" - 20/10. This is my favorite song. It makes me cry every time I hear it. The emotion in this song is so believable and real. The friendship between Glinda and Elphaba is so touching, and it's so sad to know that it's finally at end. This is more of a climax to the show than the finale is. <br /> <br />\\"Finale\\" - 6/10. Good ending. `Nuff said. <br /> <br />I'm in love with this entire CD. It's not at all a waste of money to go and buy it.
0553801503|5.0|Albeit the murederous title, i must add a disclaimer. If my expectations and foretelling of why some things happend or will happen in SoIaF future novels, will not come true, then I would back down my recomendation and station my score at a mediocre 3. <br /> <br />I believe there is reason behind what seems like a dreary setting of pawns on some peripherial borders of a chess board. I believe there is a long term strategy behind this act, and i'm basing my belief on Martin's former performence. He hasn't let me down in the former chapters of his tale, and since his website (and him through it) claims the series will most probably conclude in book seven, then book four/five should be the beginning of what should be a delicate and elaborate master-piece of modern fantasy plot writing work. <br /> <br />With great expectations come... well, this time I hope the idiom would end differently. Don't we all..? Not just now, this time..? <br /> <br />N.

B00005JO20|1.0|This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  At first I thought the awful acting was a parody.  Then I realized the movie was trying to take itself seriously.  A pardoy could've been done in 90 minutes.  At 90 minutes, this painful experience was just getting warmed up.  Terrible acting, terrible believability (ok, maybe that's my fault - expecting plausible stories in a giant gorilla movie), boring pace, and awful execution.  About the only thing the movie had going for it were a couple beautiful shots on skull island. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson undid all the goodwill he earned from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

0385510454|4.0|I didn't expect much from this book because Grisham here is a bit out of his waters.  However, I was pleasanty surprised.  In my opinion, the strongest point of this book is the plot.  The CIA using Backman as bait in order to figure out the origin of the satellite system.  I thought that was quite clever.  I also enjoyed the description of Backman's life in Italy: learning of the language, the culture, the cuisine, etc.  For a spy novel such details should be a requirement; however, I confess, I didn't know how accurate they were.  I did notice one inaccuracy, and that kind of turned me off a little.  At some point Luigi says he was dropped off in some foreign cities to see if he could survive, as part of his spy training, and he mentions Stalingrad as one of them.  Stalingrad was renamed into Volgograd shortly after Stalin's death, well before Luigi was born. <br /> <br />I thought Grisham could have done better on suspense.  The plot certainly offered plenty to work with.  This and the research were the only serious flaws, but other than that it was a nice read.
B00005MP58|5.0|I fully disagree with the person below. It all comes down to person taste but I thought it was wonderfully acted (both Ehle and Firth nominated for BAFTA awards, with Ehle winning best actress). The beauty of Austen's dialogue came alive with this production and I for one am grateful that I saw this after the new film. It turns out that I like it even better and that it really does deserve all the adulation it receives.
0780020685|5.0|Characters: <br />Very good character range.  Characters taken from many age groups and all walks of life: kindegarten children, desperate fools, wise old men, wreckless & love-sick teenagers, protective parents, etc.  The Seven Samurai are the most unique.   <br /> <br />Plot: <br />Disaster movie.  Thieves are harassing the villagers; the villagers retaliate.  A compelling plot.   <br /> <br />The story develops slowly, giving the viewer time to take it all in.  Numerous conflicts and side plots are included.  Three hours is just the right length for this film.   <br /> <br />Acting: <br />Legendary Japanese actors and good direction.   <br /> <br />Themes: <br />Un-warranted violence and justice restored, teenage love and over-protective parents, haunting memories & innocence lost, vengeance vs forgiveness, mind over matter.  Pay attention to the different types of characters.   <br /> <br />Worth seeing?  Yes.  You should watch it in one sitting to get the full efffect.  If you watch the parts on different days you will not miss anything, but the movie will probably leave a smaller impression.  So fill up good before the movie starts and enjoy.

As for the kissy-kissy all over the face (literally) ending, I would have preferred it if we got the UK ending instead. Pride and Prejudice is not a trasy romance novel.
B00005JOVN|2.0|Hollywood you better get your act together. Thanks you for spitting out another INSTANTLY forgettable \\"Blockbuster\\" Thank God I only paid $4 dollars to see this. Not only can't the Studios come up with original material. The material they remake is worse than the original. If this crap keeps up you will have even less of an audience. A good cast given nothing to chew on and a Director who has made great films and this is what we get? $150 million and the Ballroom set in the original was more impressive?<br /><br />Video games are so prevalent in society that I fear their mind numbing influence is starting to permeate even NON video game derived movies. The original movie was a good solid, involving movie. This remake takes every element of the original and removes what made it involving. I mean EVERY element. There are people out there making these decisions!! And they are paid huge sums to make these decisions! With the talent in front of and behind the camera this is truly frightening as this seems to be the norm at the present.<br /><br />Right from the start there is almost NO set up. We don't know where the ship is, where it is sailing, even what ocean it's on! Things that actually would create some atmosphere like the originals speech by the Captain explaining the origin of Poseidon. Greek God of the Sea. They are sailing on the Mediterranean, to Greece? Get it? Cheesy but involving. You know it gives the proceedings some gravatis, some mystery. In the remake we get nothing, we are are in Video game land, we don't have time for such things.<br /><br />Even the cause for the disaster has absolutely no set up. Happy new year, bang, the tidal wave hits. Unlike the originals slow build up, as it explained WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHY! Even the effects in the original worked better. They were simpler but executed as a whole created more of an impact because of the tension that was built up. Again a sense of gravity, HUMAN INVOLVEMENT and Atmosphere! Even in the original, Leslie Nielsen's corny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster. It's a very basic cinematic technique. But I guess todays more \\"sophisticated\\" audience don't need this kind of thing anymore.<br /><br />There is no human involvement in the wave hitting in this remake. The Captain isn't called to the bridge, no build up, just some crew members we've had no contact with running around. Absolutely unmemorable. The effects are impressive but who cares, I'm not given anything to latch on to.<br /><br />Straight across the board EVERY situation is diminished from the original. The scene chewing conflict between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine is totally lost in the remake. There is NO conflict with the characters. NONE! It's just one disaster to overcome to the next. You know , like a VIDEO GAME.<br /><br />Even the self sacrificing Shelly Winters death swim has almost no emotional impact because the character doesn't return and die in front of everybody. Like DUH! Hey screen writers perhaps you should learn of something called ELEMENTS OF DRAMA!! Even if you have no talent you could at least COPY the original, not make it worse! Absolutely mind boggling!! If you WANTED to sabotage the original, you couldn't have done a better job. UNREAL! All you film lovers just keep repeating \\"Things will get better\\". Repeat it like a prayer.rny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster.

B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|This has to be one of the best sonic attacks I have ever heard - the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that there are a couple of filler tracks on the album, the most notable being the 10th song which is plain rubbish, but the rest is superb. <br />I don't know quite how to classify this: Goth Metal, Opera Metal, Epic Metal, but considering fire and water don't mix then neither should this amalgamation of Pantera/Anthrax rhythm guitars, Accept (\\"Death Row\\" days) lead guitar, Dokken drums and Kate Bush vocals backed by an orchestra and choir conducted by Edvard Grieg! BUT IT DOES! <br />There have been women heading metal bands before (Doro from Warlock comes to mind) and metal bands playing with orchestras too (everyone from Deep Purple to Metallica), but Nightwish have created something here that just assaults the senses with its uniqueness,it's blend of totally opposing influences that would normally be impossible to merge into one (or in this case: \\"Once\\"). <br />I still don't believe what I just listened to ... Incredible!
0767811070|5.0|This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the \\"real\\" hood is really like.  For me this was nothing less than educational.  I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore.  This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters.  When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me.  What more can I say, except: BRAVO!

B000001C6M|5.0|In 1981, a band out of Southern California known as \\"Dragonslayer\\" was formed by singer/bassist Tom Araya and guitarist Kerry King. A drummer, Dave Lombardo, was quickly found, and Jeff Hanneman was brought in as a second guitarist later into 1981. Most of their music at this time was influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal that was sweeping through the world during the early 1980s, but after attending a Metallica concert in 1982, they were hell bent on playing harder and faster than said band and shortened their name to Slayer. By 1983, they were already signed to Metal Blade Records and released their debut album, Show No Mercy. How did it turn out? Read on for my review. <br /> <br />Well, this album is very different than all of the Slayer albums that succeeded it, because Slayer was still in transition between their NWOBHM roots and the extreme thrash powerhouse they would eventually become. Many of the tempos are modest compared to their later releases and Tom Araya shows off a very wide vocal style (all the way from low-pitch growls to Halford-like schreeches). However, look away from some of the things the band were still growing out of during this timeframe, and you'll find one of Slayer's best releases. <br /> <br />Many of the songs on this album remain classic live staples to this day (Antichrist, Die by the Sword, Black Magic), while others sound like they came straight from a Judas Priest record (Cryonics, Tormentor). I love all the variety on this album, from the progressive monster that is Metal Storm/Face The Slayer (my fave off the album) to the adrenaline-fueled tital track. <br /> <br />Overall, if you are a NWOBHM fan and a thrash metal fan, or a Slayer fan looking to round out your collection, you need to buy this album! It's still one of their best albums!
0385338082|4.0|I'm as much a sucker as the next gal for a good chick lit book -- and Sophie Kinsella still is tops on the list, in my humble opinion! In her latest novel, she has all the winning elements of a Bridget Jones-ish hit... a bumbling yet lovable heroine, a dashing leading man, and a comedy of errors. It's laugh-out-loud funny, with enough romance to keep you swooning. Great beach read.
B00005QIPH|5.0|First of all let me just say this: \\"New York City Cops\\" is way better than \\"When It Started\\". <br />Basically if you don't know what I mean by that what I'm saying is track 09 on the [UK] version is different than the U.S. one, otherwise as far as sound the CD is exactly the same as the UK version. I suggest getting the UK one over this one. Don't be afraid of the controversal artwork of the UK's. Its the music that counts and NYC cops is much better than When It Started.
B00005J6T0|5.0|With this album Madonna found maturity and defined 80's pop music. Her voice on this record has a deep mature sound and in my opinion \\"True Blue\\" contains Madonna's best vocals ever. The Madge completely reinvented herself with this record, became even more sexual and controversial with this album's music videos. This album like the last one was a huge no. 1 record and sold an amazing 8 million copies in the U.S. and an even greater 24 million worldwide. <br /> <br />Papa Don't Preach- This song is really a great statement about not giving a baby up, but keeping and raising it with the father despite her father's wishes. It was bound to be controversial as teenage pregnancy on mainstream radio was simply unheard of at the time. Naturally, it hit no. 1 on the hot 100 for two weeks.  <br />Open Your Heart- Yet another no. 1 single with an amazing beat and a show of Madonna's vocal talents. A true pop music classic.  <br />White Heat- This song is timeless. Madonna has some great vocals in this song and has a very rock-edge. It should have been a single. <br />Live To Tell- Released as a single from the film \\"At Close Range\\" it went straight to no. 1 and showed off the new Madonna with the new deep and mature sound to her voice as well as her new platinum blonde hair in the music video. This song is a timeless ballad which will probably be played on the radio forever. It indeed does deal with a mature subject in a way in that it deals with the fear of taking a very important secret to the grave. It reminds me of Anna Anderson who claimed all her life to be the lost Anastasia. <br />Where's The Party?- The popular dance track showed off Madonna's new vocal talents bubblegum pop track which sounds like it would be from \\"Like A Virgin\\".  <br />True Blue- Despite being a smash hit that went to no. 3, this song isn't one of Madge's greatest. Perhaps it's because of how old it sounds, like a song from the 1960's, a decade of pop music I'm not a big fan of. <br />La Isla Bonita- The pop classic which went straight to no. 4 is still played on airwaves to this day with it's beautiful Spanish vibe hasn't aged a bit in the 20's years since it first debuted. It paved the way for Spanish artists on top 40 radio. <br />Jimmy Jimmy- All I can say is gross. I don't like this song at all. Even Madge's vocals can't save this as it is just so corney sounding and the lyrics don't help. \\"Oh why oh why oh why oh why do fools fall in love with fools? Jimmy Jimmy oh Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Oh Jimmy Jimmy\\". <br />Love Makes the World Go Round- While not a great track, I have come to respect it. Madge makes a great statement here of world peace and love which I like very much. She would later touch on this in a very political way on 2003's \\"American Life\\" album. This song would have been better and taken more seriously however if Madonna didn't scream nonsense noises such as \\"BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIII\\" and \\"La lalalalalala\\" at the end.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I'm not going to tell you how much I loved the song Reptilia because a lot of people have already done that, even know it's a great song. I have had this CD for a long time, infact this was my first Strokes CD. Now that I have listened to FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF EARTH and IS THIS IT a whole bunch, I find myself going back and listening to this one the most even know I own all three.    I absolutely love the part in Between Love & Hate when \\"Never needed anybody\\" is sung along with catchy yet mellow twang guitar follow through.  12:51 is one of the most styled songs on this CD. I wish the strokes would go back to writing a couple more songs that sound more similar to 12:51.  This CD makes me look forward to the next Strokes album more than any of the others.
0689865384|5.0|Cinematic in its storytelling, UGLIES truly delivers a YA futuristic action tale that engages the reader right from the start. Longer than the typical YA novel, UGLIES does not disappoint in its ability to keep the reader involved. <br /> <br />It's not perfect, as some descriptions of places and actions are a bit confusing and tend to make the reader have to re-read a section to understand the picture that the author is trying to create. But with so much happening, that minor problem is acceptable. <br /> <br />As for the story itself, it's a real page-turner! Starting with a unique concept of a future where all sixteen-year-olds have an operation to turn them drop-dead gorgeous, once established, this concept really makes a reader contemplate the wisdom of such a place -- racism and preferential treatment (based on beauty) no longer exists as there is a level playing field for everyone. Sounds promising...except when more information comes out -- deep into the story, where it can have the deepest impact. As a teacher, I imagine that my students would love to discuss the ramifications of living in such a society. <br /> <br />Plotwise, UGLIES really moves and feels very much like a summer blockbuster at the movies with hoverboards, burned out cities, bungee jackets and some great quests to engage young minds who need ACTION! Character conflicts also become engaging with questions of loyalty, inner beauty, good vs.evil, and teen independence motivating the progression of plot. <br /> <br />I wish I had time right now to immediately pick up the next two books in this trilogy because I get a sense that there's more of the same in books 2 and 3. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for teen readers who want thrills on the page!

B000HBK3MM|1.0|This performer should never again be mentioned in the same breath as Billie Holiday. I was very disappointed with this CD - \\"Put Your Records On\\" is the only song worth playing.  The rest of the tracks are a boring blur, and frankly, her voice is not good enough for the ballads.  Too bad.  The only redeeming quality to this experience is that I didn't pay full price for the CD.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok...first off...when folks on this site say that this CD is a patient listening...its true. However, that said, this is one of my favorite Tool CD's to date. It is quite differnet from the alst release...but this is really a quite relaxing experience. A tribute to his mom...nothing short of a genuine masterpiece. If your open..it makes sense...of not...oh well. You miss out on a very interesting idea. These lyrics are very mentally stimulating to say the least. What a great CD.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Way back in the year off 1991 I excitedly picked up Blood Sugar Sex Magik, I loved every single song of it, as many off you agree with me Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a masterpiece, but way back then 15 years ago, nobody seemed to care for it, I mean \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Under The Bridge\\" were both recognised but the whole album was not, now many new RHCP fans have picked up it, and loved every bit of it, time made Blood Sugar Sex Magik amazing, it was already amazing but time made it more. <br />My point is all thoughs poeple giving this a 1 star, will understand in about 15 years from now that this album is a masterpiece, because when poeple look back in time, things always seem better, so naturally poeple will actaully want to listen to this, and thoughs poeple who gave this a 1 star, might feel abit guilty, and thoughs who gave it a 2 star even though thats more understandable and more realistic, thoughs poeple will feel guilty. <br />Time will make this gem shine.

B000002H97|1.0|This is where it all started; the slow and steady decline of a group of talented,pioneering artists.One of the greatest bands of all time.It seemed success had rightfully come through with word of mouth,video play on mtv and chart status .Thus allowing Metallica to poison the mainstream thru the release of And justice for all.Then they had to release \\"the black album\\" just like in the movie Spinal Tap a prophecy of garbage days to be revisited, time and time again each time they would release each shiny new turd to eager awaiting fans on the market. With a highly unsuitable producer in tow. No offense personally to you Bob Rock.I like his song \\"Eye's of a Stranger\\" from his band Payolas, but the guy had no business inflicting his dumbed-down,watered down,non-threatening,waste of talent dream to reality Metallica has become.I know it's too late,and we can't turn back the clocks from the horrible visions of Marriane Faithful,the orchestral wuss-ness,napster bologna,load, re-load,re-re-load,saint crap.I just hope we can learn from our past,and not be doomed to repeat it.

In these distributions a high-frequency or high-amplitude population is followed by a low-frequency or low-amplitude population which gradually \\"tails off\\". In many cases the infrequent or low-amplitude events--the long tail--can cumulatively outnumber or outweigh the initial portion of the graph, such that in aggregate they comprise the majority. In this book the author explains how due to changing technology it is now not only feasible but desirable in business to cater to the \\"long tail\\" of this curve.<br /><br />The author explains how in traditional retail, you have the 80/20 rule, with 20 percent of the products accounting for 80 percent of the revenue.  Online, instead, he sees the \\"98 percent rule.\\" Where 98 percent of all the possible choices get chosen by someone, and where the 90 percent that is only available online accounts for half the revenue and two-thirds of the profits.  He also explains how filters and recommender systems that help people find what they are really looking for are crucial ingredients.  Thus, in a nutshell, Anderson's theory is that mass culture is fading, and being replaced by a series of niches. Thus the subtitle of his book, \\"Why The Future of Business Is Selling Less of More.\\"<br /><br />The author explains that the three forces of the long tail are:<br />1. Democratization of the tools of production such as GarageBand for musicians.<br />2. Minimization of the costs of distribution which in turn minimize the cost of consumption such as wideband internet connections.<br />3. The connection of consumers to one another to minimize the noise down the tail, such as this Amazon review system.<br /><br />In this brave new world of niche markets, the author explains the new producers, markets, and tastemakers all of which are largely driven by the technological forces of cheap hardware and increasingly sophisticated recommender systems that tap the on-line purchasing habits of consumers and match individuals with the products that are likely to interest them the most. Anderson goes on to explain the power of Long Tail economics by citing sales and trend data in three media: books (Amazon), music (Rhapsody) and movies (NetFlix). He postulates the seemingly incredible claim that Walmart is in fact elitist, since they are constrained by physical space to offering only the most popular products. This is another basic premise of the book - that until the birth of the Internet physical space constrained retailers to offering only the most popular 20% of items because they represented 80% of the purchasing power.<br /><br />The author's arguments hold up the best when he examines the entertainment industry. It is obvious that the recording industry is at a loss as to what to do about the fact that their sales are fading fast other than to blame piracy and sue consumers that dare decide that an overpriced vanilla-sounding boy-band CD is not worth the price. You can also see the desperation in the movie industry too, that has resorted to begging people to go to the theaters at the Academy Awards, but continues to mainly output recycled and formulaic products and reaps the expected mundane ticket receipts.<br /><br />However, I think that the author overlooks two points. First, people crave some kind of common conversation with their fellow man. If we are all broken up into groups of a dozen each that all have the same politics, like the same music, and watch the same movies, then the community at large is duller for it. Take \\"American Idol\\" for example. It is obvious that this is not a hit show because America thinks that the winner is going to be the next Elvis Presley. In fact, the winners usually represent the plain vanilla output that has brought the recording industry to its knees in the first place. Can you see someone as gritty as Joe Cocker ever winning this contest? It is the audience participation and the feeling that you are part of the outcome that is the appeal. Also, people flocked to the very successful Harry Potter movies and the Lord of the Rings trilogy just as much because everyone else was going and taking their kids to see them and thus they were part of society's \\"common conversation\\" as they were because of the quality of the films. The second point that the author overlooks is that the monopolies whose death he cheers due to the \\"long tail\\" are simply being replaced by other monopolies. Who else but large businesses with the resources to mine the hugely diverse \\"long tail\\" shall prosper in the long term? A case in point is that the author himself keeps coming back to the same companies when he talks about \\"long tail\\" success stories.<br /><br />In summary, although this book is a bit repetitive at times, it makes some good points. The author does a good job of tying the old familiar \\"long tail\\" statistical graph to the rapid change in purchasing habits over the last ten years, which is something that nobody else had succeeded in doing until he articulated the trend.participation and the feeling that you are part of the outcome that is the appeal.

1592401791|5.0|The story behind this group remains fascinating. It will be retold again and again, each time from a different perspective. This book by Geoff Emerick is great because it offers a candid and detailed insider's perspective. Reading the book is the next best thing to watching a movie of the making of all those legendary albums. You can almost see and hear how they were recorded and you can sense the chemistry of the people involved in bad and good times.
B000F1IQMS|4.0|This movie reels you in at the start. It begins with the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany where 11 Israeli athletes are taken hostage and subsequently killed by the Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September. <br /> <br />The Israeli Government in turn assembles a group of covert agents to track down and assassinate those responsible for the killings of their olympic athletes by any means necessary. <br /> <br />The screenplay, acting, and cinematography are very well done. \\"Munich\\" moves along at a nice, rhythmic pace allowing the story to unfold in a way that translates well for viewers. <br /> <br />By the end of the movie, the covert Israeli agents have now been identified and targeted by other Palestinian assassins for killing members of the Black September whom have killed their Israeli athletes.  <br /> <br />The violence becomes cyclical---- Palestinian assassins kill Israeli athletes, in turn the Israeli agents kill Palestinians and the violence begins to go back and forth. As Amazon.com's review on this movie points out, \\"Munich\\" plunges \\"into complex ethical questions about the cyclic nature of revenge and the moral price of violence.\\" and I couldn't agree more!
B000002GJH|5.0|I bought this as a tape when I was a broke kid in the nineties having never heard a single track but already being a fan of Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. This was a big risk for my empty wallet and the best purchase I ever made. With this album I fell in love with Chris Cornell as a songwriter and his voice became etched in my head. This music has been described as getting you through black days, well it took me through high school and some crazy turmoil. To this day, about 15 yrs. later every lyric is ingrained in my memory and evokes the same feeling. This is the best album I own period and I've had to update a bit and buy the CD too. I guess you could call it an album worth buying twice, take that for what its worth.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I am dumbfounded reading some of the negative reviews of this DVD. <br /> <br />Many are complaining about the video, which was shot in 4:3 aspect ratio and is not a widescreen look.  Given the way the concert was shot, this was a wise decision not to cut off part of the picture for a widescreen look.  Yeah, there are some mild grainy pictures, but unless your a professional cameraman the picture quality is still quite good. <br /> <br />And the sound is flawless, a powerful 5.1 surround that literally blows the speakers away.   <br /> <br />The performance is shockingly good.  Some reviewers are Roger Waters fans bemoaning his absence, but quite honestly you can't write lyrics and create concepts (Waters' strongest suits) during a concert, and his bass playing/singing is not missed at all (with the lone exception of the verses of Comf. Numb, which is more than compensated with a blistering solo at the end).  The band is clearly enjoying themselves here and the song selection is dynamite.  I hadn't listened to 'Sorrow' in a long time but the performance just blew me away.  And songs like 'Coming Back to Life' and 'High Hopes' are now classics in their own right that sound even better with age (they were new at the time of this show).   <br /> <br />This concert is flawless.  Unfortunate that it was not shot in film, for a widescreen view, but the new sound mix as well as the extra goodies (Bootlegging the Bootleggers is worth the cost of the DVD alone, for a super-rare performance of the spine-tingling Marooned) kick this one over the rainbow.  PF fans new and old would be well advised to have this in the collection.

034544678X|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a professional trainer, and I have gained a good deal of insight on dogs from it.  Everyone who owns a dog should read Chapter 8 -- it's everything you need to know in a nutshell.  I personally could do without all the references to primate culture and the study thereof.....I bought the book to learn more about my dogs not chimps.  But it explains nicely why people do what we do, why dogs do what they do, and how we can better communicate with each other.
0375831002|5.0|I have never written an online review, however, this book moved me. The writer illustrates the beauty and the ugly of human nature in a setting so hard to comprehend from our end of history. How fortunate I feel to not have lived through World War II in Nazi Germany as either a German or a Jew. How fortunate I feel to have read this book to show me the horrors that words can cause, and the resilience of the human spirit all in one book. Please don't pass this one up, it will enhance your spirit!
0792841344|4.0|'Phantasm' has become a classic more than 25 years after its original release in theaters. This was a film that, as another reviewer pointed out, challenged the stereotype of the villains such as Dracula, the Werewolf, & Frankenstein - where their prey either fell victim unknowingly or 'lay down & died'. This one had Reggie, Mike & Jody confronting the evil Tall Man & his legions of the dead inside the funeral home - the Tall Man's domain - with a shotgun & Colt pistol. The Tall Man is armed with a series of deadly silver flying spheres that will suck the brain out of their victims, and Mike soon finds himself confronting one of the menacing devices.<br /><br />Bill Thornbury & Reggie Bannister deliver solid performances, but it is Angus Scrimm's amazing portrayal of the evil Tall Man from another dimension that stole the show. Without saying much, Scrimm conveyed a sense of menace & foreboding few actors can match. His mere presence seemed able to intimidate, as if you could sense that something nasty was about to happen.<br /><br />Horror fans will love this classic horror movie from an age when slasher films seemed to 'rule the roost'. This offers quite a change from the stereotype of the late 70's/early 80's horror flicks.
0790734850|5.0|Ahh, I love Guy Pearce.  And Kim Basinger is so nice and likeable and pretty (those eyes) underneath her period maquillage in this movie. This movie is easy to watch even though the story isn't more than just a movie however it's well done which is rare these days.  The movie isn't as gorgeous as I expected from the era.  But the performances are excellent.  Dudley Smith is satisfyingly avuncular and evil (in my mind, it's a given that the latter adjective follows the former one.)
0783240236|5.0|Perhaps, if you navigate through the creative universe you may find this entry simply does not seem to fit inside the well know pattern of his fundamental cinematography. At least that's what I sensed from the first time I watched it.<br /><br />As a matter of fact I guess nobody can deny Hitchcock had a hidden ace under the sleeve. Based on a Daphne du Maurier' s short novel, Hitchcock created an astonishing metaphor around the nuclear nightmare. The sudden rage and aggressiveness against the humans results even now quite terrible to be truth. But let's make a stop and remember: Chernobyl 1986. One of the most ominous consequences derived from this fatal accident was the well known aggressive behavior of the animals around the critic zone, that suffered in major grade the direct impact.<br /><br />From the famous conversations between Hitchcock and Truffaut , we may realize the brutal sequence in which the birds attack a farmer and leave him blind, was really inspired by a real event that happened when a crowd of crows attacked a lamb and eventually left it utterly blind, according a personal interview between Hitchcock and a countryman.<br /><br />On the other hand we may realize this is one the most sarcastic films of Hitchcock: When in the first part of the film Rod Taylor catches the canary and brings it back to its cage and smiling says to Tippi Hedren: \\"I bring you to your golden cage\\", is a caustic allusion to her, because of the fact she is a rich and consented girl. Eventually Melanie (another fine irony of Hitchcock: to use the same name Hedren had chosen for her daughter. Melanie Griffith) is attacked by the birds and decides to search refuge in the telephonic cabin; the director has inverted the logic of the reality (Bunuel would make the same in The phantom of the liberty in the well known sequence of the dinner table) and intends to set us in the same role of the birds. Now the fly free and we are trapped in our own cages.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are three wonderful aspects to remark; the first one has to deal with a moral when the teacher is attacked and murdered by the birds she was acting in defense of her brother and the man she loved: I mean it seems the birds have taken the justice by themselves when the alteration of the natural order has been broken and needs to be reestablished; second realize the order and the nature of the birds; in the first irruptions are gavottes, and what happens in the end on the final attack, are crows. And you know the mythical roots around the significance of this special avis, and finally a very curious casualty perhaps?; the previous film was Psycho: and what did we see as decorative motives in the walls of Alan? Dead birds; here you have it' s like those birds would have returned to life and to take a sort of revenge, flying from Phoenix to San Francisco. After all three years elapsed between both films.<br /><br />At the end; Taylor and Melanie are united for love but the birds seem to leave, to rejoin and prepare a new attack. It's not a farewell is just a truce.<br /><br />One of my eternal favorite films of Hitchcock, because carves in relief the suspense in Hitchcock was always a device and not a goal by itself.<br /><br />Highly recommended.On the other hand, there are three wonderful aspects to remark; the first one has to deal with a moral when the teacher is attacked and murdered by the birds she was acting in defense of her brother and the man she loved: I mean it seems the birds have taken the justice by themselves when the alteration of the natural order has been broken and needs to be reestablished; second realize the order and the nature of the birds; in the first irruptions are gavottes, and what happens in the end on the final attack, are crows.

B00005AQGH|3.0|As always, the towering genius that is Tupac Shakur flexes his muscles in this album, the first of many posthumous releases by the late rapper.  However, this album has one great flaw (as pointed out by other reviewers): anger.  A great deal of anger.  Compare \\"The Don Killuminati\\" to 2Pac's magnum opus \\"All Eyez on Me\\".  In \\"Eyez...\\" the blows of 2Pac's thug life tracks (e.g. No More Pain, one of the darkest songs in my catalogue) are softened by more poignant and concerned pieces (such as Life Goes On, Only God Can Judge Me, Shorty Wanna Be A Thug).  Not so in his posthumous releases.  On albums like \\"The Don Killuminati\\" and \\"Until the End of Time\\",  there is little to hold back the rage.  2Pac's work has always been a reflection of his inner self, his soul (like good art should be; think of Mahler, Hendrix).  Unfortunately, that soul was damned during the 11 months it brooded in Clinton Correctional.  It is that damnation to a hell on earth that is manifest for all to see in the annals of \\"The Don Killuminati\\".  Unless you wish to witness the darkest side of a man that music can show, don't by this album. <br /> <br />My alternative recommendation: \\"Me Against the World\\". <br /> <br />To learn more about Tupac Shakur, visit the 2Pac entry on Wikipedia.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|First, why does every movie that tackles Troy have to cover the whole war?  Homer certainly never attempted to do any such thing in the Iliad.  Aristotle, in fact, praised him for keeping his focus and concentrating on just a few events in the middle of the war.  After all, \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" managed to tell a pretty good story without dragging in either the Munich Conference or the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Second, the movie abounds with spectacular sword fights.  That is all very well--but it is neither Homer nor history.  The ancient poet makes it abundantly clear that the primary weapon of most combatants was the spear--giving special emphasis to Achilles' own particularly massive weapon.  (All right, all right, you Freudians can stop giggling now.)  A minority of the heroes, including the Lesser Ajax and Pandaros, used the bow as their primary weapon.  In all cases, the sword--or more precisely, the Mycenean rapier--was a secondary weapon.  Showing the combats before Troy contested with swords is about as accurate as showing the Battle of the Bulge fought with six-shooters.<br /><br />In Greece, there are numerous examples of both spear heads and bronze rapiers being found buried with the bodies of their owners.  The rapier was a thrusting weapon not a cutting weapon.  The reason for this is that it was made without an extended tang around which a hilt could be fastened.  Rather, it widened at the base and provided three holes arranged at a right angle to the direction of thrust.  The hilt was fitted around the base and riveted to it.  The problem with this arrangement is that bronze is a soft metal.  A thrust will work with no trouble, but a cut with such a weapon will tear through the bronze, leaving an embarrassed warrior waving a sword that has acquired a new hinge or, even worse, with just a hilt in his hand.  Since most of the grave swords are broken in just that manner, we can pretty well tell how it was that their owners came to be buried in the first place.<br /><br />Third--now we're getting picky--there are contemporary illustrations of Mycenean warriors--Homer's Achaeans--using the rapier.  The most famous one appears on a fabulous inlayed dagger blade.  Offhand, I cannot remember ever seeing the rapier used in anything but the overhand position, just as though it were a long dagger or maybe a short spear.<br /><br />Fourth, all the strong-grieved Acheans should be in bronze armor--shining bronze armor.  They should look like an array of bright, new pennies.<br /><br />Fifth, Achilles, who always goes to battle in a chariot is shown on horseback--arrgh!<br /><br />Sixth, the missing gods...!<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br />As for the movie, it wasn't a trainwreck.  Not a total trainwreck, anyway.  Two stars--and a third one for Peter O'Toole rising above it all.in the first place. <br /> <br />Third--now we're getting picky--there are contemporary illustrations of Mycenean warriors--Homer's Achaeans--using the rapier.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Contrary to some other comments about Tom Scholz not liking the remastering job he did on the first two albums (he was referring to the Canadian release which also had bonus tracks and was NOT remastered by Scholtz), Scholz is pleased with the latest re-release. The Canadian release has some bonus live tracks. Scholz was pretty horrified with the sound on the re-release and after hearing them he contacted Sony (he hadn't been contacted before the re-release. They agreed to let him remaster the material himself.<br /><br />\\"Boston\\" sounds terrific correcting issues with the sound.  The result is that the drums have more punch, the vocals are up front and there's better depth, definition. The artwork has also been updated with two brief essays one by Scholz discussing the recording of the album and another by Rolling Stone writer David Wild. The credits for who played on what appear for the first time correcting a lot of myths about the album.<br /><br />The packaging is nice with a booklet and the CD sitting in a digipak holder. A great debut album finally gets a worthy CD release.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is a movie that, let me say, I love.  I happen to be a fan of dark futures in science fiction, either on the printed page or on the big screen.  The fact that ideas and emotions are dangerous to men is nothing new.  The fact that this movie took an almost Buddhism goal, to control feelings, to the point where this future society is out to destroy those who feel emotions is, in itself, fascinating.  The balance between plot and characters, between action and story, is almost perfect.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and even Sean Bean are all great in the parts they were given.  I can't see any other actors doing those characters.  The commentaries, one by the director and one by both the director and the producer, really are interesting.  Beginning film makers would more likely get more out of the commentaries than I did.<br /><br />The idea that by destroying emotions you could better the world is, once again, not new.  In WE the Benefactor's goal, with the help of the Office of Guardians, was to destroy feelings and replace it with Reason (people didn't even have names).  To control emotions with drugs and brainwashing, such as in Brave New World and 1984 with its idea of Hate Crime and Thought Police, is well used in many films and books.  Burning the books, artwork, toys and music comes right out of Fahrenheit 451.  Even in Fahrenheit 451 there is many forms of brainwashing.<br /><br />But this movie is not trying to steal from these sources.  Any more than the reason for writing 1984 was to steal from WE (which is did).  The movie's goal was to tell us how important being HUMAN is.  Some people might say that idea is old yet we still don't seem to understand the need for staying human.  The warning will always need to be there.  And with such a delivery system as this film it can't fail to be passed on to the viewers.
0312995423|1.0|This book is a joke. The plot can only thrill a three-year-old. Besides that, an \\"expert\\" writer on cryptography depicted the most secretive intellignence agency cryptographers using a 5-character \\"secrecy-code\\" as their login password. The author even claimed that it was impossible for anyone to hack the password. Even the calculation was incorrect. The author claimed that there were 36 to the power of 5 combinations - considering 26 letters plus 10 numeric. However, any simple mind knows that a capital letter is different from a lower-case. Hence the correct number of combinations should be 62 (52 + 10) to the power of 5. And this mistake was made by the BEST CRYPTOGRAHER in the world. It may be minute detail, but it was this kind of \\"small\\" mistakes that really killed the appetite for reading. <br />I had to put down the book because I was able to easily guess the \\"bad guy\\" and see through the plot at a very early stage of the book. I am very glad that I had borrowed it from public library rather than wasting some valuable green bucks, as you Americans call it.
068987474X|5.0|There's a saying in this book that goes, \\"once you stop making excuses for the loser that you're seeing, he will disappear.\\" So true. I only wish it had not taken years for me to find this book to realize that. <br />LIz and Greg go into various scenarios in which a woman is dating a man, who for one reason or another has some eccentric excuse for why he won't call, commit, marry or have sex with her. Their answer is always, 'he's not that into you.\\" <br />The authors pull no punches in letting the reader know that she needs to move on when a guy is 'too busy' to give her the time of day to call her amidst his busy work schedule. \\"you should be the bright spot in his busy day\\", they say. <br />Old fashioned yet very true at times, this book is designed to bring women to the realization that they're worth more than the man that makes you call him (the lazy guy and who wants to be with him), the guy who won't commit (love cures fear of commitment), or the guy who just randomly disappears on you (my favorite).  <br />This was the most liberating book I've read in a while and is the only thing that has changed my perspective on a few things in years. Kudos, Kudos, Kudos!!!!!
B000BT97AO|3.0|This movie has 3 flaws: <br /> <br />1.  It lacks depth <br />2.  It lacks animatronics <br />3.  Intended audience is unclear. <br /> <br />I love \\"Labyrinth\\" and the \\"Dark Crystal\\".  This movie does not live up to the imagination created by these movies.  It is nice to look at, but I think the story is weak.  When I finished looking at the movie I felt like something was missing, then I realized it was depth, relevance, and animatronics.  What's the point in making a movie with the Jim Henson production studio if you are not going to use the techniques which made them unique and memorable in the 1980s.  Any production studio can make a visually unique movie with CGI.  Maybe I am being too critical and that I am too old to really appreciate this movie (23).  However, my 8 year old brother had a lot of questions about the imagery, and he did not completely understand the depth of the story line. If the movie is not completely enjoyed by an adult or a child then who is the movie intended for?
B00005JKL8|3.0|Well, not exactly, but pretty close.  This movie is the most absurd piece of cinema that I have ever watched.  I think the director purposely cast crooked-nose Owen Wilson as some kind of sick joke.  This is total fantasy from beginning to end. <br /> <br />That said, I did enjoy it on an action movie parody level.  It plays out like some kind of cartoon and I encourage anyone with a sense of humor to indulge.  Don't expect much and you will not be disappointed.  You will finish with a smile on your face. <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was a reluctant viewer.  All those raving reviews.  The oscar hype and best picture (not getting it) controversy.  The gay theme.  The cowboy theme.  The Ledger mumble. And so on. I feared both the good and bad hype--foolish me.    It started beautifully with some deliberately iconic scenes and poses, framed within the context of but to shatter the Gary Cooper/Shane mystique.  That set piece of Ledger leaning against the wall, Gyllenhall leaning against the car, the surreptitious yet almost lusty glance from JG's character; the glance he throws HL through the driver's mirror as he's shaving. This was an AL shout that either it would be a spectacular failure or a great film.    The much vaunted cinematography is beautiful, but does not slap you over the head with its magnificence as does such films as Lawrence of Arabia--making it that much more powerful in its quiet restraint, which to a large extent describes this film. Elegant as it is, this film slowly, systematically tears you apart, leaving you feeling as barren, ragged and yet as moved as the characters.      The acting from every single character is true.  I think Michelle Williams' performance is a spectacular revelation, who knew that a second banana from a teen melodrama series could act with such depth and restraint and emotional power. The shattering of her illusions is at least as soul destroying as that of the main characters.  And Anne Hathaway has a tremendous moment towards the end; in a few minutes she injects 20 years of tamped down pain and bitterness, yet through that pain, she projects a sympathy for someone else's tragedy which is unexpected, yet still in character.  The performances in this film are truly the best I've seen by a group of actors. Each of the characters breaks your heart, one by one.

B00005AQAW|5.0|First of all, I'm not a super major Feeder fan.  I've only heard \\"Polythene\\" and \\"Yesterday Went Too Soon\\" and liked Yesterday better.  That being said, \\"Echo Park\\" is the best of those three. <br /> <br />This album is solid from beginning to end.  I had a hard time picking a favorite tune.  In fact, it was one of the best albums I've heard since Embrace's \\"Out of Nothing.\\"  It's one of those just-push-play kind of albums.  The content and form of each song is fitting: the rockers kick, and the ballads were true to themselves, not wimpy or contrived. <br /> <br />Check out: Satellite News, Piece by Piece, Turn, Seven Days..., and Under the Weather for a good sampling.  Buy this and let your friends borrow it.
B0000399WC|5.0|Papillon is what other escape tales should be based on. It sets the bar high for prison movies, by invoking emotions you never thought a movie could.

You would never guess you're looking at a movie set, that's for sure.<br /><br />The mood of this movie is slow and dreary, (which reflects the story of course) and when papillon is in the cell, you're in there with him.

You really get to know these characters well, and you feel for them as they go through hell.<br /><br />Overall, I would reccomend this movie 100%. Great actors, great story, excellent scenery, and a timeless classic. Just earned a top spot on my favorite movies list.
B000002IP1|5.0|This is album is not only the best album of Phil Collins but most propably the best pop album that has ever been released. All the songs are fabulus. The orchestrations are unique, the vocals are great, and the lyrics are inspiring. I bought this cd just when it came out and it was either the first or the second cd that I have ever bought (before that I was bying vynil records). I still have it and I love listening to it. I highly recommend it. Check the list of the songs it contains and I am certain that somewhere, somehow you have heard most of these songs.
0156027321|5.0|<br />This is one of the best books I have read in quite some time!   <br /> <br />For me, it is up there with Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera' and Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.  It is story-telling that is reminiscent of bedtime tales - so wonderfully descriptive, yet grounded in a reality that demands hope, faith and will.  I liken it to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, because although it is not technically magical realism, it requires you to have faith in more than scientific reason to believe that a young 16-year old would survive on a boat with a tiger!   <br /> <br />The book is split into three parts, and I found that my interest in the book picked up after the first part.  Truly a page-turner!  The ending is poignant, and is a true character test.  How pragmatic are you?  How strong is your faith? Yann Martel leaves you longing for more pages and wishing you knew the real answer to the ambiguous finale.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|For their third Mainstream album, Foo Fighters released a two disc pack. On the first disc of IN YOUR HONOR, the rock band contains audio of their new Mainstream sound. This consists of heavy  distorted guitars and bass, along with heavy use of drums and Grohl's vocals. His use and effects of dynamics are still present, along with his high pitched wailing. The songs themselves need these sounds and are performed well with those qualities. The most noticible trait for this disc is the different rhythm chages and context for each individual instrument. The drummer's rolls are coming along nicely, and work perfectly in the pieces they are performed in. The second disc contains audio of Foo Fighters' original sound. The pieces are fairly quiet but have dramatic crescendos periodicly. The drums, bass, and guitars are still rhythmic, but with clean tones. Chord progressions tend to be arrpegiated so the musical lines sound more melodic than the first disc. The discs are very contrasting to one another, and yet quite interesting in their sounds. IN YOUR HONOR is a pack of discs containing Foo Fighters' best work, and a must have for any music collection. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"In Your Honor\\" <br />\\"Best of You\\" <br />\\"DOA\\" <br />\\"Hell\\" <br />\\"Free Me\\" <br />\\"The Deepest Blues are Black\\" <br />\\"End Over End\\"
B000065U1N|2.0|Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more. (SARR)        <br />  <br />
0790742780|4.0|Like Deniro's Travis Bickle in 1970's NY, Michael Douglas portrays a man pushed to his limit in the urban environment of 1980's Los Angeles. He's lost everything and decides spontanteously to leave his car in a bumper to bumper traffic jam and begins a chaotic walk across LA to get to his estranged wife and daughter's house near the beach.<br /><br />Meanwhile Robert Duvall plays an LAPD detective enduring his last day on the job and their paths inevitably cross.<br /><br />This is really a very memorable film and both Douglas and Duvall are excellent in it.<br /><br />The reaction of Douglas to some of the urban stereotypes including, two gangbangers, a surly Korean grocer,fast food employees and two goofy old white guys at a country club, while violent are understandable under the circumstances he finds himself in.<br /><br />At the end he asks the cop \\" am I the bad guy ?\\"<br /><br />To some degree the audience is left with the same question.
B00006JJ51|5.0|Well Ice T was talking about the street but NWA was coming out harder and more aggressive with this sound. Man this is where gangsta rap got started with this album. NWA are pioneers and Straight Outta Compton has to be one of the greatest rap albums of all time. Before them no one was talking about police brutality or gang life or even yelling fu@% tha police but NWA had the guts to say all of this. Before people wanta to yell G-Unit or Game man they be nowhere if it wasn't for Eazy E, Dr.Dre, Ice Cube, Dj Yella, D.O.C. and MC Ren. These six men changed rap forever. Now everyone want's to immitate them and sound like them, but you can't they too original and have a sound that can't be touch. People these day's don't even give this album the respect it deserves. They rather hear crappy tunes like Lean wit it Rock wit it or Laffy Taffy. Man forget those wack songs man and go buy this album and blast it in your stereo.Some songs that are great are Straight Outta Compton, Fu@% tha police, 8 Ball, If It ain't ruff, and A Bit@# Is A Bit@#. If you want to get into some hard West Coast sounds than look no further than NWA. They invented it and they will always be rememberd for it. RIP Eazy E.

1558908382|5.0|I'm not one of those people who quotes lines from my favorite movies, though if I were there are a couple in GPB that my friends would be tired of hearing.  This movie had subtlety and nuance, pain and pleasure (yup, that would be me paraphrasing) though the hair and giant cell phones make it seem rather dated.  That being said, the overall theme of going back to high school and having everyone peg you to be the exact same person that you were all those years ago, resonated for me.   <br /> <br />My favorite line? Minnie Driver's character seeing her 'long lost love' and trying to identify the emotions felt: \\"What is this that I'm feeling? Is it pain? Pleasure? Am I hungry?\\" decades later that indescribable gut wrenching feeling took her right back. <br /> <br />God I love this movie.
B000001ESP|5.0|Around the time \\"Moving Pictures\\" came out, Jimmy Page was asked who his favorite band of the moment was, a band that really impressed him and he replied Rush was the only one. It is not hard to understand why. Rush accomplished, at least with the late Terry Brown Albums, what Page was trying to do with Led Zeppelin, which is to turn them into a more progressive act without losing the edge.<br /><br />It is important to note that at this time the members of Rush had gone from their early Zeppelin & Cream influences to being avid followers of various early 70s progressive rock acts such as Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, Caravan, Camel, PFM, Hatfield & the North, National Health & Emerson, Lake & Palmer and from there even further into exploring the mostly instrumental offshoots of some of these bands like Phil Collins' Brand-X featuring the incredible bass/guitar combo of Percy Jones/John Goodsall and The Bill Bruford Band featuring the legendary Berlin/Holdsworth team. They were inspired by all of them and were trying to do work that measured up and they did.<br /><br />They had nothing to worry about until they decided to \\"change direction\\" and pretend that regression into pop was somehow a bold Peter-Gabriel-Security type less-is-more progression with \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" and everything that came after (Gabriel himself fell prey to this anti-pomposity-at-all-costs manifesto starting with the \\"So\\" album and has been going downhill ever since).  I would say that from \\"Hemispheres\\" up until the end of \\"Signals\\" they were officially a full-fledged card-carrying state-of-the-art prog-rock act well-beyond the ambitious hard-rock stage of \\"Caress of Steel\\" through \\"Farewell to Kings.\\"<br /><br />The zenith of all this absurdity in pursuit of imaginative sounds of inspired passion was the paradoxical hit-parade (4 songs that have each been played at least a million times on AOR radio stations) of supreme sonic assault and simultaneous enlightenment called \\"Moving Pictures.\\" \\"Moving Pictures\\" was the perfectly refined, organic machine, the Mercedes or BMW, the ultimate driving machine of all arena hard rock, practical but uncompromising (Colosseum II achieved a similar unheralded engineering feat in Europe with the quite heavily intense progressive hard-rock album \\"Strange New Flesh\\" but didn't stay together long enough to get anywhere near arena-rock popularity levels, finally ending up an excellent mostly instrumental fusion group with the masterpiece albums \\"Electric\\" Savage\\" & \\"War Dance\\"). The perfect machine can still be improved on but only slowly and is a very delicate and fragile thing. One little part missing will ruin everything else. Parts started missing with more and more frequent regularity starting with \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" when one of the more important parts, Terry Brown went missing. Rush, almost overnight became an unhip band, and as the years went on and no previous glory returned, a ridiculous and even boring band just like Yes & Genesis in the 80s and 90s and yet they were still a huge live draw and a great live act (for the ultimate demonstration check out the crazy \\"Rush in Rio\\" pandemonium of a concert on DVD). Why? Because live is where they brought out the ultimate driving machines of 2112 through Signals and drove the hell out of them with the audience in the passenger seat. The large catalogue of songs from those albums are what the fans really pay to see and what they go the most ape-sheeioit for.<br /><br />The reasons \\"Moving Pictures\\" rules over all other rock albums (with the exception of King Crimson \\"Red\\") are many. Here are a few off the top of my head. \\"Moving Pictures\\" rules because:<br /><br />it is not just hard rock with a ball-busting, hyperactive rhythm section that is as ferocious and loud as it is mathematically precise, it is not just so wired and intense that you are amazed the entire band doesn't spontaneously combust from the energy, it is not just bizarre and mysterious and weirderthan anything else this side of Captain Beefheart and Edgar Broughton Band, casting a spell with its surreal moods and screaming banshee vocals, it is not just tonally rich with beautifully recorded tones of pure `rush-inducing' organic orgasm out of very loud instruments, it is not just  progressive and complex with more tempo and time changes and shifts of syncopation in it than all Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple albums put together, it is not just a collection of 7 peerless anthems (even the instrumental YYZ is an anthem, far beyond just a mere instrumental) that have the romance and power of myth and withstand literally a thousand listens and still shine, it is not just a unique combination of music and poetry that stands on its own in the larger sense and simultaneously connects deeply and directly with disaffected youth and whatever remnants of it remain in the so-called adult that has become of that youth instantly and painfully, it is not just corny and pretentious enough to make you smile in amazement that despite all its excesses it somehow works so majestically, making the corny an essential part of its charm like so many other great rock records, it is not just produced better than any other album of any kind of music ever and at the highest decibels possible (you need a minimum of 200 watts for a proper tearing-the-plaster-off-the-walls blast-off, I run a Bryston 4B ST through Polk Rti12s), it is all these things at once in subtle shifts and perfect, mysterious, transcendent balance.

0156030306|2.0|I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, \\"What goes up must come down.\\" right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic. <br /> <br />All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, \\"coming of age\\", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before.
0802136834|5.0|I am a fan of historical fiction, with many books focusing on the women in the time of King Henry VIII. After so much historical fiction, I decided to get my facts straight. This book was fantastic. Though some parts are a little long (the waiting for the annulment of Henry's first marriage) this book is well-written and easy to understand. It was so much fun to learn so much about Henry and his wives. While I was familiar with Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, I enjoyed learning more about Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, and the last two Katherines. This book was great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a historically accurate account of King Henry and his wives. (The photos in the book were an added bonus.)
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album is fantastic as it stands on its own.  Musicians are artists, and as such must expand upon and move into different areas to develop creatively.  If you want growth you must expect change.  If you are the type of person that wants to package and label everything into neat organized boxes then perhaps you won't care for this album because you were expecting it to be exactly the same as the last one or like some hybrid.  Some may say that this album isn't as strong as the first and if you're that type then your missing out on some fantastic music and lyrics.  Listen to this with fresh ears and not as if it has to fit some preconceived notion of what you think Audio Slave should be.
1400049628|4.0|At first i'd thought it be stupid, but after reading it it is informative and humorous. It leaves no leaf unturned as far as avoiding zombie attack and gives many examples.  Great read, would recommend if looking for something different than your average book.
0634049011|5.0|This book is gonna blow your mind. The first 2 chapters alone will teach you more than many entire guitar books. You will be doing a lot of applying what you learn through drawing and playing, which really brings the lessons home and aids your understanding enormously. This book comes highly recommended for guitarplayers of all skill levels. GIT have done it again!
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is unlike any other band on the planet or in any dimension! They are metal, yet progressive, yet not metal. Not your typical Nu-metal or post punk or post rock or whatever label you want to put on them. They have created their own rhythms, styles and melodies that defy everything that most people consider \\"metal\\" or \\"progressive\\" or \\"rock\\". Hard hitting, chanting invoking Tribal infused rhythms that unleash the inner being of animus and energy within, lyrics that speak of healing/magick and pain, bass lines that add a massive depth to the music, and guitar riffs that crunch and wail throughout ones soul. Aenima(IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU SPELL IT PEOPLE, STOP OVER OBSESSING AND OVER ANALYZING EVERYTHING!) at its very core is an amazing work of art that centralizes around the colors electric blue, black, white and green, and emphasizes the unleashing of anger and resentment toward humans, all the while converting pain into power and experience. Raw lyrics sung by one of the most beautiful voices on the planet, laid over some of the most head nodding and soul evoking sounds. Dig deep down into yourself and feel what comes out of you when you hear this music. Some kind of primal feeling of something that is had to remember, yet you know it is there. Aenima is an experience of emotion and pure energy. No other bands can do that. None come close. Tool is in their own catagory. Don't get me wrong, there are no humans on this earth that are better than any other humans, and to think so is pure idiotic and sub-servient. One of the core themes around Tool is the empowerment of the self, which a lot of Tool fans, and metal fans forget or don't know about. Some praise Tool as gods. Please people, they are just people too. Every artists is just a person who happened to speak first. WE all think these things and feel them, some of us just say them first and say them loud. I love Tool, and I think they are amazing musicians. I think that Aenima is chock full of anger, misdirected at that. Anger is good, if one knows how to utilize it and put it in its place. The mystical side of this cd is a wonderful and a great journey into the pain of humantiy and power of us all. I don't believe that this is their greatest accomplishment(LATERALUS IS THE ONE), but this is certainly one of the best albums of its decade and of our generation. But then again, what Tool album isn't?
0694003611|5.0|This book is great! You read the book in soft tone and it is perfect to your little one to sleep. My son on occasion request this book for bedtime. It is a great book to point out objects in the room.  <br />I think this book is calming that is why it is perfect for a bedtime story.
B00005B36H|5.0|This IS the difinitve \\"metal/progressive\\" album of our generation. Listen to this album and it will make you wonder why you would ever listen to another band(save for Opeth's Ghost Reveries of course). NOthing compares or tops this album. Lateralus is one GIANT monsterous masterpiece, an epic of all epic proportions. From the album art, to the final track of static and fuzz, this album delivers. Intense, complex mathematic rhythms and melodies, and lyrics that are hazed in medaphors and spiritual elightenment and healing, Lateralus is literally a stunning piece of art that must be appreciated. Not really your average metal album that you stand around and bang your head to, its more of a contemplative and emotional experience, like all of Tool's works. It is a journey into the healing path and the path to finding your true self amidst the pain and emotions that have \\"backed up\\" and plagued our beings since birth on this planet. It's about remembering what we are and what our purpose on this Earth and in life is. It is about forgivness and healing and overcoming greed, jealousy, anger, hatred and contempt for human nature. It's about opeing our connection to the ALL and to our true power. As Aenima closes with prying open one's Third eye, Lateralus opens with letting go of the grudges and pain and weight that the human experience brings, lifting us up out of the ocean and into our being. Severing that anchor that keeps us down. And what a perfect way to open the album! It sets the stage for the long path of healing and experience that is encountered along the way. The album peaks with the main character in the album finding his eternal self and ends with the character of the album still struggling with the hardest aspect of the human experience, namely letting go of it all, humbleness and dropping the heavy ego, accepting everyone as equal/powerful beings of the universe. The album also holds mysterious magical undertones of the unknown,the endless void of all creation, and the divine nature of humanity. Some call this album self absorbed and self important. Not so much! Its more self empowering and about healing our beings and rebuilding the temple of humanity from its severed state into a whole again. Jambi on 10,000 days has a similar meaning. I believe that Lateralus is the peak of Tool's creativity and their best album ever. The instrumentation on this album is perfection, nothing comes even close to this album. Each Tool album has colors associated with it as well, and the colors for this album are black and all the colors of the rainbow. Inclusion is a reoccuring theme in this work. Such a masterpiece. This is one of those albums that willbe remembered in 50 years. A true progressive work of art.
B000002I4S|5.0|This is another example of how great a saxophonist John Coltrane was. He created a new chord progression that had never been heard before. It was a long journey; even in Coltrane's early playing as a sideman, you could hear that he was trying to take the music to another level. He needed to be free, and he needed changes that challenged himself technically and took the listeners to another level. That was achieved with \\"Giant Steps.\\"  <br /> <br />Today, this is still the standard that every jazz saxophonist has to live up to. Getting to the level that one can actually attempt Giant Steps takes years of practice, and then to fully master the chord changes takes lots more practice. It won't happen in a day or a week.  <br /> <br />No one will be able to do it the way Coltrane did. He practiced 16 hours a day. He continued to take his music to another level and another level, year after year, album after album and never stopped until the day he died. There will never be another Trane. Saxophonists will come and go, but Coltrane set the standard. Everytime I listen back to a Coltrane album I am reminded about his greatness, his humble artistry, and his great work ethic.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|When I first heard about the Mars Volta, I thought them to be just another experimental band out there, like all the others. They scream into the microphone, play some wierd stuff on their instruments, and bam! You have a record. But no! I was way, way wrong. My first forray into the Mars Volta was with Frances the Mute, and I was literally blown into the wall of my bedroom leaving an indent and brown stains upon the plain white walls! <br />If you have not heard of the Mars Volta yet, check them out. They are a sonic experience to say the least. Not really being able to place them in any catagory, they defy all the laws of musical theory and genre. Part Jazz, part post punk rock, part experimental, part rock, part latin infused, the Mars Volta create masterpieces that bend the definition of music at its very core. Most of the tracks on Frances the Mute span over ten minutes save for track no. 2 which is a short but very sweet tune that will have you singing along in no time. One of the wierdest things about this band is that, though their music is far, far, far away from mainstream radio music, they have the ability to invade your head like a deadly infection, you'll be humming their melodies and lyrics long after(they are THAT good!). Their style involves rapidly changing time signatures and infusing each song with multiple styles, which provides for a tasty musical experience. Erratic and mutated guitar solos lurk in these parts, as well as sonic out-of-the-box experimentation into unknown musical realms a-la Miles Davis and a multitude of other Avant Garde artists. The vocals are superb, their singer can hit all the notes, high and low, and his voice is incredible. You WILL fall in love with his voice! The lyrics are cryptic and hidden within medaphors and codes that make listening fun and engaging. This particular album, Frances the Mute is actually a concept album. Each song relates to a character taken from a diary that their late, great sound manipulator found in a car while he was a repo man. This album is AMAZING and I recommend it to all music lovers, avant garde lovers and lovers of anything that expands into the unknown and the uncharted in music and art. The salsa and latin infused touches to this album make you wanna dance, and the electronic and avant garde touches at such ambience and depth, seriously you will be doing yourself an injustice if you do not purchase this album. They truly define the \\"concept\\" album.
0896760839|5.0|If you are really serious about authentic reproduction, this is the book for you. I wouldn't recommend it for beginning or \\"sort-of\\" experienced seamstresses, but if you are skilled, it is THE book to have as far as I'm concerned.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|For an upbeat album such as this one is, the lyrics are really dark and depressing and the musings of a depraved and twisted mad man tortured and experienced in hellish ways and pain of emotions and life. The overall vibe of the album portrays a grey cloud of haze and painful sorrow infused with soul and tight beats. Danger Mouse delivers another masterpiece in the form of amazing beats and production. Cee-Lo shines with dark lyrics and a soulful swagger. There are a lot of throw backs to retro music, nothing wrong with that! Cee-Lo's raps(what little are on this album) are off the hook. The music is full and well thought out and put together. The album opens with \\"Go-Go Gadget gospel\\"(amazing horn stabs and vocals), which seems a little out of place but sets the stage for the theme of the album(a song about being free from constraints, but maybe a delusioned freedom?), especially when the first track fades away out of tune and into one of the best tracks on the album \\"Crazy\\"(which is also their hit on the radio). Crazy is such a great song, being dancable and catchy yet depressing and dark. After Crazy establishes the groundwork for the mind state of the artists, St. Elswhere begins and it depicts an isolated man lost in despair, away from everyone else. Smiley faces seems to deal with being happy in dreaded situations or something like that. The song may be about smiley faces and the beat may be upbeat and happy sounding, there are very dark and sad undertones to the song. Boogie monster seems to be aobut personal demons and haunting memories and a man who is disturbed and a little crazy. The music has a neat 50's monster mash theme to it. Great song. Feng Shui has some flows by Cee-Lo, a song about his peronal space I believe, simplicity(not really sure). Just a thought is about thoughts of hopelessness and suicide. Transformer is a great song with amazing beats and lyrical flow. Seems to be about changes and constantly changing. Who Cares seems to be about relationships and udnerstanding people. On-line is a little ditty by Danger Mouse and minor lyrical input by Cee-Lo. Necromancing, probably the most disturbing song on the album. This song seems to be about the singer rather killing a woman than letting her go(maybe?), either way its a cool song. Storm coming seems to be another tune of a dreary nature. And the final track, the last time is like a farewell about exerting all pain and emotions through dancing. I was very happy with this album, except for the cover of \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\". I don't really care for the original either. I usually find myself skipping over that track. A very enjoyable album that I would recommend to all!
B0002W18MU|4.0|Some times it seems a recitation, a litany, when his voice sinks and air breath misses, but in others there is a powerful gravity of voice that reminds the Johnny Cash of ever. American V: A Hundred Highways is a posthumous record of the greatest country musician and it is described as \\"the final recordings\\" in a notice adhered to the CD. It has just been released what it is the product of a fruitful cooperation between producer Rick Rubin and Johnny Cash since  1994, in the American Recordings seal, one which recovered Johnny Cash back from the memory haul, revealing that quality and authenticity are genuine stamps owned to this big songwriter and Country music icon.<br /><br />There are great themes in this record, like mellow, bluesy \\"Like the 309\\" (track 3), a song by John R. Cash himself, but the 12 tunes represent a walking by compositions of other masters of diversity of popular music, including a version of \\"Help me\\" (track 1) by composer  Larry Gatlin that take us back to that unforgettable duet of Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, by traditional religious topics like \\"Gods' s Gonna Cut You Down\\" (track 2), backed with a powerful support of guitars and percussion, the sad \\"On the Evening Train\\" by singers' hero Hank Williams (track 6), as well as personal themes that bright by themselves like \\"I Came to Believe\\" (track 7).<br /><br />I can imagine John saying \\"I always wanted to sing this song\\" when he interprets songs as far from his usual style as \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\" (track 8), but I believe that at this time in his life, Johnny Cash sung just what he pleased. For instance,  songs from as authors as different like Gordon Lightfoot (track 4) or Bruce Springsteen (track 5). And I believe it is most appropriate the title \\"A Legend  in my Time\\" (track 9) by Don Gibson, one of the famous Gibson Brothers.<br /><br />My friend Jerry Clark, a noted American scholar in Folk and Country music claims this will not be the last record that Rick Rubin will produce with material from Johnny Cash. I expect it is true because many people are longing to continue enjoying the harmonies from the heart -more than from the throat- of Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, © 2006Johnny Cash.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I must be blinded by the off-the-beaten-path time signatures and the tribal drum beats of Danny Carey and the bass heavy songs, but I felt that this was a very accomplished and amazing Tool release that was well worth the wait. Too many so-called \\"fans\\" and \\"experts\\" of Tool's music heckle this CD because they waited 5 years for 'THE BEST ALBUM EVER\\" and all they got was this. Well, you clearly don't know anything about Tool my friends. They aren't out to pacify and cater to you. They have always made the music THEY want to make for themselves, not for YOU. They are about change and progression. 10,000 Days is the perfect progression from their spiritual transcedance of Lateralus. Where else can you go when you have reached the pinnacle of your musical existence? Back to the world of Humanity my friends. What did you want, another Lateralus? Sorry, these guys call the shots, not you.  For those of you that are disappointed with this release, I think that you have no understanding of what Tool do in their music, they express through art, not always making songs that \\"sound cool\\" or head banging tracks for \\"METAL HEADS!\\". For too long the \\"wrong\\" fans have been listening to Tool and trying to call this HEAVY METAL. Its Progressive guys, get it right. Tool hate to be called metal as well because lets face it, the Metal scene is full of ignorant fools who think they know whats going on.    I have read and heard many things about 10,000 days. Mixed reviews, angry fans, lackluster reviews. I'm not sure what album they are all listening to, but it sure ain't the new Tool release, 10,000 days. Ever since Lateralus I have been anticipating a new Tool release, checking with record stores and on-line, waiting for the new album to release. Lateralus did much to slake my esoteric thirst and I knew that a new album by Tool would be, for lack of a better phrase, \\"off-da-hook\\". When I was able to get my grubby little hands on a copy, I was blown away, and apparantly everyone else was too. Everyone(including me) was expecting something that would shatter the very foundations that Lateralus built, destroy the remnants of all the Tool albums to date, and rebuild something so monumental that none could touch it or bask in it's infinite presence. WEll, for the most part, they did do just that. The only problem is that people do not see it that way. Most people expected their new album to top Lateralus, which it does in some ways, and in others, it does not touch Lateralus at all. But thats the point, because its not supposed to be anything close to Lateralus at all! And people don't realize that and they compare and judge. Lateralus is an AMAZING album that is one of the must have albums of our generation, if not of all time. The concept, the instrumentation, the lyrics, the overall production and mastery that is Tool all over the album. Lateralus is saturated and reeking of perfection in all forms. BUT, and this is a big BUT, 10,000 days is an AWESOME album, near perfection in its own right. Not meant to be a \\"clone\\" of any of their previous releases, 10,000 is its own entity, color, sound and vibration. 10,000 days sounds like itself, with minor influences from their past. Many reviews trash the album because it sounds like other Tool releases. But how could it not? Unless they totally changed their style, they are always going to have the Tool sound. And at the same time, the album sounds nothing like other Tool releases. Show me in Tool's discography a song that sounds like Vicarious, Jambi or The Pot? How about the epic 10,000 days/wings for mary? Right in two? Sure the other songs on the album have similar ideas to other songs in their discography, but 10,000 days leans on no shoulders. It is a giant of its own. Another qualm I have heard about is Danny Carey using a electronic drum kit for this album instead of an acoustic one. What's the problem? Not natural? An electronic drum kit just allows the user to incorporate other sounds and clarifies the sounds, thats it. It is still used the same way as an acoustic drum set. I was in a band with a buddy who used an electronic drum set and it allowed for many options. Danny Carey bangs that thing to perfection. I would say that 10,000 days is their most accomplished, in theory wise, in instrumentation and lyrics. Lateralus is the Pinnacle of Tool's existence, bar none, period! That is their best album ever in my opinion. Many would argue. Aenima was amazing, but still in the confines of rock/metal, same with Undertow and opiate. Aenima was the beginning of their true progressive nature, but Lateralus brought in the amazing concept/puzzle pieces style and complex mathematics. True, all their albums have complex rhythms and tribal influence. But its with Lateralus and 10,000 days that the tribal influence and the complexity arise more, more so with Lateralus. 10,000 days is poignant in its own way. I really LOVE this album and do not see why people trash it other than the fact that it did not appease their indulgant selfishness. Everything about this album is amazing. I find myself repeating songs over and over again so I can hear the songs in a cohesive whole, just like I did with Lateralus and Aenima, more so with Lateralus. The segues that everyone complains about are awesome and meant to be what they are, segues, not filler. You want filler go buy Green Day or Sum 41 or any other generic rock band. Lipon conjuring, Lost keys and Virginite Tres are ambient, atmospheric melodies that are not meant to be songs, just enjoy them for what they are. I recommend this album to lovers of music in general, amazing musicianship, and lovers of true lyrics and meaningful music and Tool fans that enjoy Tool's music because it is ever changing. This is Tool evolved, not regressed. You can track Tool's progression through the albums. First album Opiate= very angry and more heavy metal, very raw album, the foundation, Undertow=emotional pain and still angry somewhat metal,the roots, more personal issues on this album, Aenima= pregressive metal and angry but healing, the stalk, Lateralus= spiritual healing and very progressive and very evolved, the trunk, and 10,000 days, less angry and very much so progressive, more mature and evolved than the others, the branches. That's my cheesy anaolgy. I love this new album, do yourself a favor and pick it up!  People need to realize that this aint your typical angry \\"I hate the world\\" Tool release. They have grown up and evolved, and the music on this album shows it fully.  The lyrics are deeply reflective of present day society and ring true to me. The isntrumentation is as awesome as ever.   It is what it is folks, and those expecting the \\"GREATEST\\" thing to ever come out of in like forever!!!! is sadly mistaken as to what the who Tool belief is all about. I am not saying that I know, I just know that they did not make this for the fans, but for themselves. Many say that they did this for money, or that they are a burned out band that turned to \\"mainstream\\". How many times do you hear 10,000 Day's songs on the radio? How many times do you see their video on TV? I haven't ever...but I don't listen to the radio or watch MTV or any [...] like that, so I don't know.  You can judge this album all you want, the fact remains that Tool was in no way trying to \\"top\\" Lateralus or any of their previous albums. That's not the point and those of you who view it like that are sadly mistaken and I feel bad for your horrid outlook on life, always comparing and judging and being the critic when you probably don't create art yourself. Its not about crafting the \\"holiest of holies\\" album over and over again, its about creating art the way you want you.  NUFF SAID
B00000294R|5.0|Big L Is one of the best lyricist to ever touch the mic,if not the best.His flow,voice,rhymes, and hard hitten punchlines.What rapper you know has all of these qualities? Only a rare few.He has God given talent.If he don't have talent,then I don't know what talent is.He also has very good song writing skills and concepts.Thats also something these rappers of today don't have or come close to.What happened to the game? Because today they don't have albums or rappers like this no more.
B000002UJQ|5.0|While I am a bit surprised that this album does not have the five-star rating it deserves, I don't think it matters much, considering just how influential Radiohead is.<br /><br />This album is indeed one of the culminations of a group of geniuses who are some of the most creative music artists of this time. It manifests our era not just in technology, as the title suggests, but in the daily lives of different people everywhere.<br /><br />So, I guess despite the rating, this album speaks volumes about the greatness of Radiohead. And it's no surprise to me that many agree.
0060920084|4.0|Except for the Little Brown Church in the Vale, it is hard to find anything of consequence to put on a viewmaster slide of Iowa, Bill Bryson's native state.  Directions are important to Midwesterners.  There is an absence of landmarks in middle America.      At Pella there is a tulip festival every May.  Speech in southern Illinois is more southern than midwestern.  The author drives to Oxford, Mississippi.  The students at the university there look serene, and it is impossible to imagine their parents rioting against the entrance of James Meredith. Tupelo is thirty miles east.  Columbus, Mississippi is a jewel.  In Columbus, per the COMMERICAL DISPATCH, the police don't have crimes, they have activities.  Next, passing through Alabama, Bryson is in Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Tuskegee.  In Auburn Bryson wonders why there isn't a decent bookstore since it is a college town.      The Little White House of Warm Springs, Georgia is of interest.  The cottage is snug and appealing.  At Lafayetter Square in Savannah there are brick paths, trickling fountains, and Spanish moss.  There are two hundred year old houses.  There is perfection.  There are one thousand historic buildings in Savannah.  Beaufort, South Carolina has mansions, too, and a little parrk and an marina.  At Charleston there is detailed Victorian ornateness.      In the Great Smoky Mountains the author stays at Bennett's Court, and old-fashioned motel.  The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most popular national park.  In Gatlinburg Bryson goes to the Ripley Believe It or Not Museum.  Mount Vernon is genuine, educational, interesting, unlike Williamsburg.  Delaware is the most obscure of all of the American states.  After visiting friends in Philadelphia and enjoying a view of Fairmont Park, Bryson has a good time touring the Eisenhower farm near Gettysburg.  He states a long bus ride in America resembles a prison stay.  He leaves his car in Bloomsburg with friends to go to the Big Apple.  Later he hits New England and proceeds westward to return to the midwest, Clevemland.  He drives to Toledo on the Ohio Turnpike, and then to Dearborn, Michigan.      The Henry Ford Museum is in Dearborn.  It is enthralling and the scale is breathtaking.  No cars or motorized vehicles are allowed on Mackinac Island.  In Nebraska the author looks for Winterset, birthplace of John Wayne, and Red Cloud for the Willa Cather connection.  Dropping down to Kansas to Russell, (Bob Dole), he finds that Dodge City is West.  Holcomb, IN COLD BLOOD, is beyond Dodge City.  Bryson dubs the Clutter murders grisly and sensational.  It seems that IN COLD BLOOD had been banned from the public library in Holcomb.  People hated the book.      Cripple Creek and some of the other famous places in Colorado now cater to tourists.  He visits St John's campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico to see his niece.  Nothing prepares a person for seeing the Grand Canyon.  Nevada is the state with the highest crime rate.  California yeilds recollections of television watching in childhood.  Sequoia National Park is an exciting prospect, an opportunity to drive through a tree.      Sun Valley, Idaho was built in the thirties, it seems, by the Union Pacific Railroad as a ski resort.  Yellowstone is the oldest national park in the world.  Bryson believes Custer was an idiot and a brute.  There wasn't much to the Battle of Little Bighorn.  Bryson tries to eat in Sundance and discovers the restaurant has been comandeered by Shriners.  He travels to South Dakota to Mount Rushmore, seeing it is free, and moves next into Minnesota and Iowa, to his relief.  After Storm Lake, another college town, the trip is completed.      Parts of the book are very funny.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love this movie. It is by far one of my all time favorites and I've seen it more times than I can count. But the introduction by John Lasseter is the most annoying thing ever. Why is it necessary to tell me how lucky I am to watch a movie. Let the movie speak for itself, don't spoil it with your unnecessary and unwanted commentary. Put that kind of stuff in the special feature section for people who are interested.<br /><br />That being said, this is a magical film and lovely on so many levels. I see it like a Japanese version of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, but relying less on words and more on imagery and ambiance.<br /><br />My two year old son also seems to highly enjoy this film.
1594200823|5.0|This book is not only full of valuable information but it is a meditation on the philosophy of eating. Michael Pollan is able to, without judgement, show us why eating closer to our food source is a valuable practice. I recommend it highly and have purchased several copies for friends. It is truly an amazing book!

B000002UB3|5.0|Although I knew about the Beatles in 1974, I first became aware of the importance of Abbey Road when a junior high teacher  told us that the second side of this vinyl lp was the \\"most important in rock history\\" up to that time.  Was he right?  Heaven knows, he was an English teacher at a small Catholic school in metro Detroit,  who knows what his music credentials were.<br /><br />But I never forgot that, and after years of my own modest piano and guitar studies, my amateur sleuthship regarding the fab four running three decades now, and listening to music, I think there's something to that.<br /><br />We've always been taught that \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was the first \\"theme\\" album the Beatles put out.  And true that!  But even so, on \\"Abbey Road\\" they perfected that, with a perfect medley on side 2 that even gives a hint of the heartaches they were going through as a band....This starts in \\"Carry that Weight\\", which is introduced by a lullaby, \\"Golden Slumbers.\\"  \\"You're gonna carry that weight a long time,\\" as if the writer knows this will be a weight, this will be grief, no matter what, it will hurt. A reprise of \\"You never give me your money\\" from the other side comes in, referring to the frustrating legal negotiations, with its refrain \\"in the middle of negotiations, you [or in one case I]break down\\". \\"All the money's gone no place to go\\": not being tied down to these prior obligations is strange, but there's \\"a magic feeling\\". Then comes the delightful end of the medley, \\"The End\\", which is a simple statement often used as a Beatle quote:  \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\\"<br /><br />Prior to the \\"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End\\" medley, which was written by Paul, who also plays piano and  sings lead, we hear a pleasant, airy caribean-like tune by John called \\"Sun King\\" that plays off of George's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" on the previous side.  He continues with the playful \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\", two Pythonesque character sketches, and Paul takes it from there with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.\\" (which legend has it is a true story about one of Linda's escapades).<br /><br />Almost as an afterthought,  Paul squeezed in a music hallish ditty about Queen Elizabeth at the very end of the lp called \\"Her Majesty\\": \\"I wanna tell her that I love her a lot/But I gotta get a belly full of wine...\\"  (No word on what Elizabeth II thought of the song, but she still knighted Paul in 1997, so she either forgot about it or it didn't bother her too much.)<br /><br />The one difference I noted on the CD was the lack of differentiation between \\"sides\\", since I do feel each side was almost an album in itself in this case.  The transfer to CD worked beautifully, I think.  There does not seem to be any background noise.<br /><br />Trivia note:  \\"Abbey Road\\" plays a distinctive role in the Paul is Dead hoax.  Proponents of that ignoble theory claimed clues were planted on album covers by the Beatles for fans to \\"prove\\" Paul was dead.  See if you can find a skull, a corpse, and a message about Linda weeping and Paul's age.Paul takes it from there with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.\\" (which legend has it is a true story about one of Linda's escapades).

B0009X7664|5.0|What is up with the digital touch up of Gregory Peck's face! The DVD cover of this Legacy edition makes him look much younger than he truly is in the picture. *Sigh* I guess that's Hollywood for ya!<br /><br />\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a beloved classic, and also one of my favorite films of all-time.<br /><br />Robert Mulligan directs this film. His style of film-making is one I've come to appreciate and love! He creates character-driven films that are much more heartfelt and personal, plus so much more enjoyable and satisfying to watch. Most would agree that well-developed characters are the essence of great films--same goes for stories, too!<br /><br />Harper Lee's classic novel was a huge success, mainly because of the unforgettable characters. My personal favorite was Atticus Finch (portrayed brilliantly by Peck). He was a brave man who didn't have to use his fist or a gun to get his message across. He embodied goodness, justice, virtue, integrity, courage--all relative qualities that I associate with honorable men. Scout and Jem were fortunate to have him as a father--and as a role model, too!<br /><br />This Legacy edition is definitive for all DVD collections. As for the film itself, it's timeless. It will no doubt be cherished and enjoyed by generation of moviegoers to come. OUTSTANDING five stars!<br /><br />NOTE: Mulligan's last film, \\"The Man in the Moon,\\" is another favorite of mine--a rehash of the nostalgic, \\"Summer of '42.\\" It's a gem and one that I highly recommend!
0743487583|4.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818 is amazing in part because it is still so readable and enjoyable.  Based on my vast experience with bad horror interpretations of monsters, I expected this book to be dull with a main character who was both slow and stupid.  Not so.  Shelly creates a monster who possesses a reasonable IQ and incredible physical abilities.  This book has a good plot, dialogue and fast-paced story.  It is easy to read, understand and has an unanticipated ending.  Highly recommend for middle school and above.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|It astounds me how much growth Muse has undergone since their humble inception in 1999.  Their debut album, \\"Showbiz,\\" was not as polished as their later recordings would become, but it showed what they were capable of, and showed that they had something unique to bring to a long-stagnant music industry.  Since then, the band has gotten progressively better with each subsequent release.  \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" finally got them some of the recognition they deserved, and 2003's \\"Absolution\\" managed to launch them into the worldwide spotlight. <br /> <br />Three years later, their highly-anticipated \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" has finally arrived, and may very well be their crowning achievement. <br /> <br />The album showcases a band that has continually improved and reinvented themselves over their fruitful career, and a singer that has come into his own.  The band's philosophies are still as diverse and mysterious as they have ever been, but the band seems so much more confident, more polished, and more sure of themselves than they have ever been.  Put simply, \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" is Muse's finest work yet. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"Take a Bow,\\" functions more like an introduction than it does a stand-alone song.  It speaks of an awakening to the corruption of the world around us.  It is an enjoyable track, which carries a certain similarity to \\"Origin of Symmetry.\\"  But as delightful as it is, it's only a taste of what is to come. <br /> <br />\\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is the first single from the new album and was wisely chosen, in my humble opinion.  Thought it frightened some veteran Muse fans with its unsettling dance-like beats, it proved that Muse is not afraid to try something new.  Not only that, but it can pull off yet another reincarnation of the band with grace and style not typical of most modern bands. <br /> <br />Following \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is the fantastic \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" which would also make another worthy single.  It features expert percussion and guitar work, as well as some of the finest vocals that Matthew Bellamy has ever served up.  I am prepared to call it the very greatest Muse song ever. <br /> <br />Other stand-out tracks include \\"Assassin,\\" \\"Exo-Politics,\\" \\"City of Delusion,\\" and the fantastic closer \\"Knights of Cydonia.\\"  \\"Assassin\\" is one of the heaviest songs on the album, and its paranoid rambling complements the atmosphere of the album quite flawlessly.  \\"Exo-Politics\\" and \\"City of Delusion\\" are two other tracks which speak of rising up against tyranny and \\"Demonocracy.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Knights of Cydonia,\\" besides having one of the coolest song titles ever, is another exceptional track.  It combines unearthly sound-effects with a theme that would fit in with any Western movie.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable song, and one that makes quite an excellent closing track. <br /> <br />The only real complaint that long-time Muse fans may have is the glaring absence of Matthew Bellamy's insanely talented piano work.  The long piano ballads that permeated \\"Absolution\\" are largely absent on \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" except for the song \\"Hoodoo.\\"  Bellamy's impressive piano solos were part of what made Muse so unique and appealing while they were \\"growing up.\\"  \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" is surely the band's most mature album, but I hope they have not chosen to shed the piano for good.  Still, the band's undeniable prowess with their other chosen instruments makes up for the lack of piano. <br /> <br />Muse's latest is what fans and critics alike have hungered for.  Throughout the years, Muse has tried to prove to the world that they are world-class musicians.  Some of us have never doubted this fact, but their latest album may yet convince the skeptical.  I give Muse's \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" a prefect score because the band has crafted a musically diverse and glorious gem of an album.  Musically and lyrically, this is Muse doing what they do best, the best they have ever done it.
1594200823|4.0|This is the most-hyped food book in my memory, and to a great extent it's worthy of it. There's no other work with so much information about the substances we put into our bodies as food so fascinatingly put together and so pleasingly written. It's journalism at its best. <br /> <br />And like most journalism, it has its share of errors --I recognised one on every two or three pages, from my years of experience farming and gardening and cooking. Not big important errors --how much does it matter to a nongardening reader that greensand is a ground rock used as a slow-release form of potassium, not calcium, for instance?-- but enough of them to make me wonder if the fact-checking was as sloppy in areas out of my competence.  <br /> <br />But never mind. Read about the omnivore's dilemma anyway. You'll never look at a Happy Meal the same way again (and by the way, Mr. Pollan is brave enough to admit that he quite enjoyed his MacDonald's meal --enough to convince you of his utter dedication to honest reporting right there--). And maybe you'll be inspired to track down and devour some of the 'real food' so interestingly treated in this book.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|We just happened to have a VHS copy of this tape when we adopted our son at age four from a foreign country. In his first weeks at home, he watched the story over and over, seemingly endlessly.<br /><br />This should have been no surprise, I suppose. When you think about it, Pinocchio is really an adoption story--the tale of an elderly man who has crafted a new life from his profound wish to have a child.<br /><br />Adopted children are not crafted, of course. They are a great gift from their birth families, who have sacrificed the child, usually (I think) because they know they cannot provide him or her with adequate care. And yet, the child does in fact become \\"real\\" when he or she accepts the adoptive family as his own, and accordingly finds a real place in the world.<br /><br />For our son, Pinocchio provided the perfect metaphor at the perfect time and place. Here was a boy who awoke one morning in a strange environment he did not recognize, who was unable to attach to those who loved him, or even to tell right from wrong, or why telling the truth is an essential trait for all. Here was a boy who had so little self-respect, he could feel \\"at home\\" anywhere.<br /><br />Pinocchio finds himself at Geppetto's home, replete with other puppets on strings, who unlike him, cannot move or speak, not to mention the music boxes, coo coo clocks, Figaro the cat and Cleo, in a fish bowl. Eventually, as most grown-ups know, Pinocchio learns the lessons of love and the importance of family, bringing all his wishes true.<br /><br />For all children, this is a wonderful tale. But for adoptive children, it is especially poignant, for Pinocchio got a second chance, as do all adoptive children.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Here in the case of Blackholes and Revelations, Muse has presented the world with its next album and once again has continued their musical evolution.  With every album Muse gets a little more complex.  On this album Muse expands their talents and it is very pleasing to listen to.  I think readers get a jist of this cd from the other reviews... In my opinion its a turn in a good direction! <br /> <br />... but as for the \\"politics\\" of this cd... i can see how it could be taken that way, however i just saw MUSE live last night and not only was it the best show i've ever been to, but they never took the time to say anything other than thank yous.  If they had a political agenda i think they would say something more... but that isnt the case so take the music as its meant as - ear candy

B000FVQYYK|3.0|Muse have become one of my favourite bands after seeing them at an outdoor festival show in February 2004. Some of their songs have become attached to parts of my journey through life in the time since. So I literally ran out and bought this album as soon as it became available. It's definitely been inspired by the music of the 80s in a BIG way, while still maintaining the Muse sound. I don't find it as gratifying as Absolution, however. They are trying to be challenging and to break new ground. I should note Queen, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin didn't hit 10/10 with every album release, and I don't expect Muse to either. <br /> <br />The first and last tracks are absolutely superb - both 10/10 efforts. It's just a pity the rest of the album can't compete and at times suffers from being a bit too derivative. <br /> <br />* Take A Bow sounds like a soundtrack for the end of the world, it isn't really a \\"song\\" as such and almost threatens to turn into techno at one point. It's also one of the two most blatantly political tracks on the album, clearly aimed at GWB and those like him.  <br /> <br />* Starlight is a good if fairly generic song, with echoes of 90s era Britpop and also their own song \\"Time is Running Out\\". <br /> <br />* Supermassive Black Hole could almost have been released by Prince. Falsetto vocals over a chorus harmonic held together by a strong beat and one-string guitar. <br /> <br />* Map of the Problematique reminds me of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" in more than a few ways. It's darker, it's heavier, but very reminiscent. <br /> <br />* Soldier's Poem definitely has echoes of \\"Love Me Tender\\" by Elvis Presley and vocal chorus techniques that are even older, I found this one a bit flat personally. <br /> <br />* Invincible starts with a military-style drumroll being faded into a tune not entirely unfamiliar but still original. It gets towed through modern prog-rock territory towards the end into its dramatic finale. <br /> <br />* Exo-Politics is a fairly straight-ahead Muse-electro-rock number. <br /> <br />* City of Delusion would be far more solid if it didn't borrow so heavily from \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" - it is otherwise an excellent song with a definite Latin feel and some of Matt's best vocals to date. <br /> <br />* Hoodoo starts off in a Spanish/Middle Eastern-inspired jig which falls away into the album's most downtempo minute and a half before some brilliant piano kicks in to rescue the song and deliver it into the apocalyptic second section. It then eases out with a whimper. <br /> <br />* Knights of Cydonia is one of the two best on the album, and reminds me a lot of Blondie's \\"Atomic\\" but with Queen playing and producing, and it has several changes of pace along the way, building up into a solid rock close. It too has a lot of soundtrack elements (I wonder is Muse going to get into soundtrack production in the future?)

B000FVQYYK|4.0|Muse's new album was good, but a large disappointment (because their albums are usually great.) The songs are far less epic and some are encroaching on the style of more girly American bands like Death Cab for Cutie (and track 4 sounds like Depeche Mode composed it.) I would guess that this change of style is an attempt to get Muse on the radio more, but I haven't heard that from anyone (purely my opinion.)  <br />One of my chief concerns is they are getting too electronic! You can still get the favored Stockholm Syndrome-like sound from Knights of Cydonia and arguably some other tracks, but the rest of the songs aren't as hard I would prefer them. Piano also isn't as prominent compared to their previous albums. <br />It's a good album, but it can't hold a candle to Origin of Symmetry and is beaten by Absolution as well.
B000002AZX|5.0|This is Cohen at the peak of his ability and the last Cohen album to use real musicians throughout. \\"The Hunter\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", \\"The Night Comes On\\", and \\"If it Be Your Will\\" are brilliant. \\"The Captain\\" is a more mature version of \\"The Butcher\\" (from \\"Songs from a Room\\"). At first I thought \\"Heart with No Companion\\" objectionably drab, but now I see the album needs something lighter at this particular point; it actually works well in context. The reviewers who prefer bowdlerized versions (which, by the way, are not \\"covers\\"; this is not what the term \\"cover\\" means) of \\"Hallelujah\\" are nuts.
B00005UEAR|5.0|First of all, I must say right off the bat, as a devoted Dream Theater fan, words just can't describe how much I love this band. They are without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest bands to ever grace our planet, and they're one of my all time favorite bands as well. Not a single word can describe how incredibly gifted and remarkably talented these guys truly are.<br /><br />Now onto the album. Dream Theater's 2002 epic 2 disc masterpiece entitled \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is without a doubt the band's best album, and it's also my favorite DT album as well. This album is also the perfect follow up to their epic 1999 masterpiece \\"Scenes From a Memory\\", which is also a masterpiece too, heck every DT album is a masterpiece, but like I said before, this album is their best. On here you have those epic soaring vocals from James LaBrie, those awesome breathtaking guitar solos from John Petrucci, great hearable bass lines from John Myung, spectacular keyboard effects from Jordan Rudess, and fantastic drumming from Mike Portnoy. Disc 1. of 6DOIT opens up with the heavy as hell 13+ minute epic \\"The Glass Prison\\". This song lyrically is about fighting alcoholism, and keep in mind that this song is also dedicated to Bill W. the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. This song is no doubt one of the heaviest songs on this album. It's chock full of thunderous guitar riffs, blazing solos, rumbling bass lines, heart thumpintg double bass drumming, dazzling keyboard effects, and epic vocals to boot. This song is also divided into three parts as well: I. Reflection, II. Restoration, and III. Revelation. There also the first three parts of drummer Mike Portnoy's Alcoholics Anonymous suite as well, and continues on with parts 4-6 on \\"This Dying Soul\\" from 2003's Train of Thought, and parts 7-8 on \\"The Root of all Evil\\" on 2005's Octavarium. Overall, this song is my absolute favorite on the album. Next we have \\"Blind Faith\\" which is very haunting yet an awesome song with an excellent rockin chorus and some big catchy hooks. Another one of my favorites. Track three \\"Misunderstood\\" is a great power ballad with great lyrics and some ominous soloing that will leave your jaw dropping in delight. Track four \\"The Great Debate\\" lyrically is about the issues of a stem-cell research, and it's another fantastic track with more great lyrics, a soaring chorus, and excellent musicianship. Then we have the 6+ minute piano ballad \\"Disappear\\", which has excellent piano melodies that will just bring tears to your eyes. A great song to end disc 1.<br /><br />On Disc 2. We have the epic 42 minute title song, which lyrically is all about mental illness. Keep in mind, this entire song is broken and divided into eight and yes I DO mean eight parts. The song begins with \\"The Overture\\" which contains orchestral-like melodies courtesy of keyboardist Jordan Rudess. The second part \\"About to Crash\\" is a great tune with lots of great melodies, and a nice melodic guitar solo from Petrucci near the end. The song really gets thing going with part three \\"War Insid My Head\\", and then on part four, \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" all insanity breaks loose. The guitars, the drums, keyboards, bass, and even LaBrie's vocals are pretty intense. This is easily my favorite part of the song. Then we have the beautiful melodic \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" where LaBrie's vocals are very emotional and Petrucci's guitar solo is absolutely beautiful as well. \\"Solitary Shell\\" another melodic and beautiful part has excellent accoustic passages by Petrucci, and more great singing from LaBrie. The \\"About to Crash (Reprise)\\" contains more solid musicianship, and is awesomely rockin infectious, and then we finally reach \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\" which closes this fantastic 42 minute epic. Absolutely incredible.<br /><br />The songs and the ratings<br /><br />Disc 1.<br /><br />1. The Glass Prison (13:52)<br /><br />  I. Reflection<br /><br />  II. Restoration<br /><br /> III.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie (or, as its proper title goes, \\"The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain\\") is a modern fairy tale, and a movie so unique in every way that there really is nothing to compare it with (though the makers of Big Fish took a good look at it, for sure). Set in 1997 Paris (but a version of it with quiet railwaystations, uncrowded streets and no tourists...) it nonetheless has all the atmosphere and feel of the 50s. It is sweet, funny and optimistic, yet has at its core a strange note of nostalgia and quiet melancholy. Its subtle surrealism at times expands into marvellous flights of fancy: don't be surprised to see young Amelie play doctor to a green blubber monster, to hear the bedside lamp and the paintings on the bedroom wall discuss their owner's love life, or to see Amelie's inner conflicts dramatized in the TV broadcasts she watches. None of this, however, gets in the way of the viewer's involvement with the characters, who, strange as some of them are, have a real power to move. The impression of disarming innocence is merely superficial, as becomes clear when we find Amelie wondering, while overlooking the city, how many couples are having an orgasm right at that moment (15, and we get to see them all), or when, later, she tracks down the love of her life in a sexshop. The daring mix of ingredients is thoroughly European, and, indeed, very French. This could never have come out of Hollywood.<br /><br />After a resume of Amelie's childhood that's as hilarious as it is effective, the story proper gets under way when Amelie hears the news of Princess Diana's death. (Don't miss the original French: to Amelie and her friends the princess is known as 'la-dee-dee'). Shocked, she drops the cap of a bottle she's holding, which rolls down the bathroom floor and dislodges a tile. Behind it, Amelie finds an old cigar box stuffed with boyhood memorabilia. Her 'fabulous destiny' is revealed to her in a flash: she will find the owner, and if he's moved by the retrieval of this box, Am&eacute;lie will dedicate her life to making others happy. And so it goes. Amelie starts working her, often very inventive, little miracles among the people in her vicinity. And a colourful bunch they are: the old man who never gets out of his house because his bones are brittle as glass, and who spent the last 20 years painting endless copies of the same Renoir; the hypochondriac Georgette, who, ironically, is a cigarette seller; paranoid Joseph, who sits in the bar where Amelie works day in day out to record observations of his ex-girlfriend's behavior on his dictaphone; Amelie's obsessive-compulsive father, and his inexplicably travelling garden gnome; the concierge, still pining 40 years on for her lost lover; the bullyish grocer Collignon, who, 'unlike artichokes' has no heart (and gets his just deserts in some of the funniest scenes in the movie), and his soft-spoken help, Lucien; and of course the strange young man who collects discarded snapshots from the garbage at railwaystation photobooths. Unfortunately, when it comes to her own happiness, Amelie is pathologically shy. Much like Austen's Emma she goes about arranging things for others, and forgetting herself: she prefers to live a dream. And when despite herself she finds the dream coming true but requiring decisive action, she comes up with some very complicated ruses. While the story unfolds, there are delightful surprises around every corner, both in little asides to the plot (Amelie wants to give some money to a pan-handler, who says 'No thanks, miss, I don't work on Sundays), and in extraordinary visual finds (when Amelie's first hopes of finding her lover are dashed, she literally dissolves into water).<br /><br />The film has a dreamlike quality throughout which has to do with the golden glow of the images, the surprising takes on familiair Parisian sights, and the wonderful cinematography. The effect is greatly enhanced by the fantastic musical score, with piano and musette to the fore.A feel-good movie if ever there was one, yet eschewing every staple of that genre. A must-see.feel-good movie if ever there was one, yet eschewing every staple of that genre. A must-see.
B000062X9B|5.0|There is so much postitve press for Johnny these days, that I wrote it off as hype.  I was so wrong!  Fans of rock, blues, folk, gospel, country, and maybe even heavy metal will all find at least one song on this release that will take their breath away and make the disc worth purchasing.  The song selection is inspired, and the Heartbreakers provide respectful backup to Johnny's time-worn vocals.  Notice I said \\"respectful\\", not respectable.  The musicianship is stellar.  The band shuffles, ambles or swaggers as the song demands.  For me, the song \\"The Mercy Seat\\" is worth the cost of the cd all by itself.  The lyrics are chilling poetry, the music is incredible and Johnny's interpretation of the song conveys deep emotional impact.  The same goes for \\"I See A Darkness\\" and \\"One\\".  I never quite understood what the song \\"One\\" was all about.  When Johnny sings the lyrics, I understand.  That's what makes Johnny and this cd so special:  with each and every track, you will connect with what he's talking about.  He makes every song REAL.  \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" sums up the sorrows of a family man, while \\"Nobody\\" is a tongue-in-cheek ballad about the pains of someone who has no one to love.  Yet Johnny as narrator is equally convincing on both tracks.  I really appreciate the dark and depressing passages throughout this cd, and the moments of happiness and hope shine through like sunlight through dark clouds.  I highly recommend this and every other Rick Rubin produced Johnny Cash cd.
B000002G7E|3.0|That's more like 2.5 stars.  While I do claim that the Velvets' debut IS an unabashed classic, this one ain't.  It's easily the worst album of the Velvets' short career.  Why?  Read on. <br /> <br />To put it simply, this album basically takes the flaws of the first album and develops them.  Of course there are some really great tunes on here (the title track, 'I Heard Her Call My Name') and there's one track that sounds extremely interesting the first time but is excruciating on subsequent listens ('The Gift'), two tracks that leave me indifferent ('Here She Comes Now', 'Lady Godiva's Operation') and the infamous 17 minute waste of a track 'Sister Ray'.  While admittedly 'Sister Ray' is an improvement on 'European Son', it still gets EXTREMELY tedious when you have to listen to it for 17 minutes.  I wish I could ignore it, but by doing that I'm discarding about half the album.  To be fair, it's not THAT bad, but 'The Gift' gets incredibly stale after first listen.  It's an okay album, but it's not essential.  Get it last, after the other VU albums.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|As a Muse fan who only first heard of them after Absolution, for Black Holes and Revelations, I was anticipating the release of a new Muse CD for the first time. I had NO idea what to expect, I love everything Muse has ever done. Showbiz, Origin Of Symmetry, Hullabaloo and Absolution are all amazing, jaw dropping albums and I've listened to them obsessively for a year. Anyways, on with the review of BH&R.  <br /> <br />1) Take a Bow- An amazing song, opening with soaring synth arpeggios accompanied by beautiful strings, but it soon bursts into a techno/apocalyptic monstrosity of a song. This is Muse's most openly political song. The lyrics are as powerful as anything Matt Bellamy has ever written. Great song, and an amazing way to kick off the album. <br />2) Starlight- An obvious single. Catchy bass line by Chris Wolstenholme and memorable drumming by Dominic Howard, who has MANY shining moments on this album. Fun, catchy, beautiful song, and Matt really seems to pour his heart out on this song. Will be a hit single. <br />3) SuperMassive Black Hole- Great song, interesting choice for first single in the UK. Fuzzy Marilyn Manson-esque guitar riff, along with awesome falsetto and throw in a crazy dance rythym, and you have a big hit. Maybe the first prog rock/dance song ever written??? <br />4) Map of the Problematique- One of the best songs on the album. Should be a big single. Great guitar work with a driving rythym section and awesome, yet simple piano thrown in the background. This is the song Depeche Mode WISH they would have written. Beautiful, very powerful song. <br />5) Starlight- The tenderest, prettiest, and unfortunately the shortest song on the album, clocking in at barely over 2 minutes. This is a hate-it or love-it track. I love it. Possibly the softest song Muse have ever written. The vocals near the end of the song sound like Matt Bellamy meets a Beach Boys ballad meets Queen. A truly memorable track. <br />6) Invincible- Good, uplifting song. Starts off with marching drum beat and guitar slides. Pretty song, with a powerful chorus. The bass breakdown is memorable and serves as a great buildup to a truly magnificent tapping guitar solo by Matt. Wonderful song. <br />7) Assassins- This is Muse at their heaviest. Matt's playing a System of a Down type riff, Chris is holding down the bottom, and Dom is playing the fastest, craziest drum fills imaginable. All in all, this is a great rock song with a huge chorus and very political, and yet powerful lyrics. <br />8) Exo-Politics- The only straight forward rock song on the album. Simple drum intro leads into an awesome, catchy guitar riff with Matt's as ever perfect vocals. Throw in some super fuzzed bass and you've got an awesome song. Some of Matt's most interesting and paranoid lyrics come as he wonders aloud \\"When the Zetas fill the skies, will our leaders tell us why?\\". It's not often you hear a song about alien invasion, leave it to Muse to make the most bombastic songs fit perfectly into the middle of an album... then again, seeing as how everything they do is epic bombast, this should be no surprise. :) <br />9) City of Delusion- This song has been a fan favorite. Begins with acoustic, Spanish-influenced guitar work and it blows up into a huge, epic, amazing song. This is an incredible track and it doesn't sound like anything they've ever written, with great bass-lines, strings, and a trumpet solo!!! Not to mention, the chorus features Matt singing as emotionally and powerfully as I've ever heard him. <br />10)Hoodoo- Another Spanish guitar style song. Truly a dramatic, powerful track. Features a dramatic piano breakdown in the middle. Finishes with some of Matt's best lyrics... \\"I've had recurring nightmares, that I was loved for who I am... and missed the opportunity to be a better man.\\" <br />11) Knights of Cydonia- In my mind, undeniably the best song on the album. This is Muse at their finest. Knights ranks right up there with Citizen Erased, Hysteria, Plug In Baby, and Muscle Museum as one of Muse's greatest accomplishments. Fantastic galloping drum beat... fuzzy, tremolo picked guitar line... Matt's amazing voice... a Queen-esque chorus featuring the lyrics \\"NO ONE'S GONNA TAKE ME ALIVE, THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. YOU AND I MUST FIGHT FOR OUR RIGHTS, YOU AND I MUST FIGHT TO SURVIVE!!!\\". What else could you ask for? The perfect ending to one of the best albums I've ever heard. <br />All in all, this MAY be the best work Muse has ever done. I love every song, and I hope this is the album that truly helps them become the biggest band in the world, as I know they have the potential to do.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.  It is a lot of fun to watch.  The behind the scenes film is enjoyable, also.  I highly recommend this to anyone that is an Alfred Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart and/or a classic (suspense) movie fan.
0380713802|5.0|Although Bill Bryson books are very popular (and deservedly so!), what originally prompted me to read one was a comment in a review of John Donoghue's book called Shakespeare My Butt! which likened John's style of writing and humor to that of Bill's.  Since I'd enjoyed John's hilariously funny book so much, which is in part about his own escapades around the strangely named places in the North East of England, I thought I would give one of Bill's books a go too. I was certainly not disappointed. What a great book `Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe' is.  <br /> <br />It chronicles Bill's escapades as a solo traveler around Europe in a hilariously funny way. Being pick-pocketed in Florence, food ordering dilemmas in Germany, hotel nightmares in Luxembourg, lethal motorists in Paris, and more - much more. It's all in there, and we've all been through similar situations too on our own travels. Bill's observation of Europe is spot-on, and the wit that he uses to relate his traveling experiences to his audience takes no prisoners. It's pure comic genius and certainly had me laughing. <br /> <br />Now the only problem is that I can't decide who my favorite author is, John or Bill - so I guess they will both have to take joint pride of place on my bookshelf!
B00006D295|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this movie and raved about it so much that I bought it on a whim, I will have to thank her for the rest of my life.  This movie isn't just a musical on acid, it's actually an incredible story that will forever be treasured by anyone that watches it.  The songs are incredible, the acting is superb, and believe it or not theres a good message mixed in--\\"God Bless Living Sincere.\\"<br /><br />If you've seen the movie before and didn't get it, maybe you should watch it again.  If you've never watched it, it's high time you do.  It's impossible not to sing along with \\"Science Fiction, Double Feature\\" \\"Sweet Tranvestite\\" \\"Touch-A Touch-A Touch Me\\" \\"Dammit Janet\\" and every other song they sing, not to mention dancing along with the \\"Time Warp.\\"<br /><br />I've been passing around the DVD ever since I discovered it, and everyone that's watched it has fallen in love (Most of them so much that they ran out and bought the DVD themselves).  It's a weird story that manages to touch our own strange emotions like nothing else can.<br /><br />PS> the DVD is actually something to rave about as well, the extra features are amazing!  You can watch the movie with special versions that plays the audio of audience reactions when they watch it in a theater (it's an audience interactive movie) and it even shows the audience too which is great fun!  It's funny/really cool seeing all the fans dressed up in costume and throwing rice during the wedding scene and covering their heads with newspaper as Brad and Janet run through the rain to the \\"Frankenstein Place.\\"
6305263248|5.0|I love to watch action movies. Better still, I love to watch Robert de Niro in action movies (15 Minutes, Men of Honour, Godfather...). I also love to watch Jean Reno in action movies (The Professional, Mission Impossible, Wasabi...)<br /><br />Imagine my surprise, when I saw both Robert de Niro & Jean Reno in the same action movie!<br /><br />Ronin is a very interesting movie. Very exciting, too. It has a complex theme, a twisting plot as well as perplexing subplots, exotic settings, rising & falling actions, a critical but unknown object of pursuit, witty dialogue, all compounded by a host of mysterious key characters & their vague relationships (IRA terrorist, Russian mobsters, ex-CIA & ex-KGB operatives).<br /><br />What I have enjoyed most from this movie is watching Sam (Robert de Niro) assuming the role of a strategist in the snatch team. As a strategist, he is always asking clarifying questions & verifying details. I am amazed at his astute power of observation, as shown below...just to name a few scenes:<br /><br />- scanning the surroundings from various angles before entering the pub & checking out possible escape routes;<br />- sensing danger & spotting a sniper at the bridge while conducting a covert weapon buying exchange near the bridge;<br />- sizing up each member of the snatch team, especially Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard playing the rogue electronics expert) by intentionally pushing a cup over the table edge;<br />- reconnaissance, testing the camera & taking photographs unsuspectingly at a hotel lobby & creating a diversion...;<br />- noticing the wrong suitcase immediately after a ambush/shoot out;<br />- spotting a wall advertisement as a possible lead to the whereabout of the Russian mafia;<br /><br />Even Vincent (Jean Reno) demonstrates it, especially when he spots, from a window in a cafe, a young girl carrying a metal suitcase, while trying to figure out with Sam the exact whereabout of Gregor, who had switched & stole the original suitcase earlier.<br /><br />The Power of Observation is obviously a very important character trait of a Ronin.<br /><br />I understand a Ronin is a masterless samurai.

B0002OERI0|5.0|The best thing I can say for this CD, is that its great. <br /> <br />It takes you away from the older versions of Green Day, but in a good way. They always manage to adapt to the generations that follow them. With the song American Idiot, they prove that. The first time you hear it you may feel insulted, but if you listen to what there saying you'll probably agree that you dont want to follow the norms that America has laid out for us. My second favorite song is St. Jimmy for no other reason than that its a fun song to blast in your car. <br /> <br />Hate to sound like a critic here but: <br /> <br />\\"You won't want to miss out on the fun and intelligence this CD has to offer our youth of today.\\" <br /> <br />As a 17 year old. I highly recommend it to all those that have followed Green Day.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Whenever someone asks me what the weirdest movie I've ever seen is, I always mention Eraserhead.<br /><br />I'm proud to say that Eraserhead is one of my all time favorite movies.  Everything about it is dream like, nightmarish, and surreal, making it one of the most unique experiences one will ever encounter in cinema.<br /><br />Eraserhead's content and story can't be explained with words.  You must see it to really understand it.  Basically it revolves around a paranoid man in a decaying industrial world who discovers he is the father to a hideous mutant baby.<br /><br />Like David Lynch's other films, there is no official explanation to Eraserhead.  It is up to the audience to figure out what all of the symbolism means.<br /><br />Eraserhead isn't for everyone.  It is easily the weirdest movie ever made, and it can be disturbing to certain viewers.  However, the artistic quality is great, and the surrealism makes it unlike any other movie.<br /><br />Bottom line, whether you love it or hate it, Eraserhead is definately worth viewing.  The meaning behind it is up to the viewer to decide.
B000FGGE6I|4.0|Watch Milla \\"Yovovitch\\" kill about 5oo guys for an hour anda half. <br />Good that they kept Milla in front of the camera for 90 minutes. <br />Who cares about the plot. <br />I bought Zoolander and Milla was only in it for 2 minutes. Bummer
B000GIXLO8|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when \\"The Two Towers\\" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.<br /><br />This edition contains both versions of the movie -- the original, shorter theatrical version, and the second extended edition with lots of extra footage. While the first one has nostalgia value, the second is undoubtedly the best.<br /><br />The extra scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, although the handling of the Faramir character comes as a mild shock.

B000BKVQTS|2.0|I like Terry Gilliam's stuff. Brazil is wonderful and Twelve Monkeys is the best time traveling movie ever, but this movie does not click. It starts off really slow, I gave up once. The second time I fast-forwarded through sections I saw before and was able to make it all the way through. There are some good moments and it does tie some loose ends together, but it is just too weird. The non-fantasical world is stranger than the enchanted forest. The happy ending works, but it was a very convoluted and nonsensical path to get there. I can't recommend this movie. It is Gilliam's worse movie.
B0002W18MU|5.0|\\"American V - A Hundred Highways\\" finds Johnny Cash at death's door. The listener feels as if at the funeral itself. This is no pick-me-up. Unlike \\"American IV\\" which had its share of outlaw Cash, this recording is The Man In Black about to cross over. Nonetheless, it is beautiful in its raw vulnerability. The voice, though strained and ravaged by time and sickness, still packs a wallop. Raspy, out of breath and as reflective as ever, Johnny Cash apparently had a few things left on his mind. These songs find Cash ruminating over his mortality, and reaching out to his Higher Power as he prepares for the end. <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"If I Could Read Your Mind\\" - a tear-jerking affair as Cash, clearly struggling, manages to deliver a deeply moving interpretation in that one-of-a-kind baritone. And just try to hold back the tears during \\"The Evening Train\\" -an undeniable tribute to his late wife. It's a stunner.  And \\"The 309\\" - the most upbeat of the tracks - is a gem.  <br /> <br />This entire collection sounds like a man putting everything in order before his final call. On \\"American IV\\", Johnny sounded as if he wasn't quite ready to call it quits. With \\"American V\\" it seems as if he's finally ready to go...what a treasure. <br />  <br /> <br />

6305252521|5.0|I remember my brother coming back from the theatre after seeing this film. I asked him how it was and he said he and his friends hated it. They expected the usual Jim Carrey film with him giving a over the top comedic performance. I still couldn't wait to see it and still found it to be a great movie. I thought Carrey was about as goofy as any of the villians in the  Batman 60's series when he played the Riddler. I always thought he'd be a better actor if he took his medication lol. Here he must've took it since he gives a more laidback and heartfelt performance.<br /><br />  He plays a man who was filmed on a set without knowing for his entire life. His whole life was scripted with him not being able to do things that he really wanted to do his entire life. He wants to sail across the ocean. So they had him sail with his tv dad and faked his death so he'd be afraid of the ocean. The girl he really wanted to be with wasn't even allowed to be with him since it wasn't in the script. Since she trys to tell him that his whole life isn't real, she gets rushed off the set never to be allowed on it again. A actress on the show played by Laura Linney gets shoved in his face so much that he eventually marries her.<br /><br />  This isn't the usual hyper-active look at me I'm Jim Carrey and I'm funny comedy. The film is funny on it's own without him trying a little too hard to be funny like he usually does. For instance it's funny how everyone advertises products as they're talking to him. Like when he's having a heart-felt conversation with a buddy of his, he'd be advertising the 6 pack they're drinking. Or his wife advertises what they'll be eating.<br /><br />  It's a clever comedy with Carrey letting everyone around him act without trying too hard to steal the show from them like he usually does. He gives a smart performance where you can tell he's thinking and knows that everything around him is a little odd. While in other movies he talks so much that you'd think he doesn't even take time to even use his brain lol. When Carrey gives a sensitive performance that actually shows he can act he gets ignored by the Academy and by his fans who just wanna see him go back to talking out his butt. It's sad though because this is a really good performance that he deserved credit for. At least Ed Harris got a deserved nomination as the selfish creator of the Truman Show who would rather see him dead than have him escape and...destroy ratings and the show.sn't even take time to even use his brain lol.

B000F3AAUW|4.0|Cee Lo was always a creative force starting with the Dungeon Family, then moved as a solo artist.  This is his most successful work to date under an alter ego with Danger Mouse.  This album is fun & refeshing each time you listen to it, its also not a negative album at all.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite musicals. With breathtaking sets and Minnelli's beautiful eye for detail this movie has a powerful impact and is simply breathtaking. Often forgotten and overlooked by Broadway this movie is powerful with it's music and it's all-star cast. Judy Garland gives a performance that rivals her \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" one and in my opinon deserved an Oscar for her job as Esther.<br /><br />A movie made during the post-war era the movie was all about family and that longing to go home similiar to musical \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" in it's message of the power of the love of home. \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" is a gem to own in your DVD collection and perfect for any true GARLAND fan. Garland's version of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" ALWAYS gets me teary eyed.  Another notable performance is down by the adorable yet sometimes morbid portrayal of Tootie by Margret O'Brian- who won an Oscar for her performance and was one of the youngest actors to ever do so... is simply lovely in this movie and makes this movie sparkle on screen.<br /><br />All about discovering love, family, and having pride in your roots. This movie is more than a musical classic- it's a family classic. Based upon the story of a Victorian family living in St.Louis at the height of invention and the growing anticipation of the World's Fair. The Smith family deals with courting, a huge crush Esther has on the boy next door, and the family's struggle as they learn they must leave their beloved St.Louis. This movie a real treat and a warm-hearted look back at the good old days...<br /><br />With colorful characters and memorable songs including \\"Have Yourself  A Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\", \\"The Boy Next Door\\", and Garland's infamous \\"Clang Clang Went The Trolley\\"... Meet In St. Louis cannot go wrong. Hit the buy now button and see Garlands best performance since The Wizard Of Oz and be enchanted by young Margret O'Brian in her Academy Award winning role.
B000E8LQQA|3.0|I was really excited to read this book being a huge fan of Indian literature. Unfortunately, this book did not captivate my interest and I had to put it down after a hundred pages or so.  It was very slow going and the plot could not keep me interested enough to read the whole book.
B000063DHF|5.0|These Vinyl replica released by Sony are amazing. Yet available since 2002, maybe the fans are waiting for a japanese reissue in mini-lp sleeve, until today not released. <br /> But the US vinyl replica is very good, the quality of sleeve is superb, have the same 2 enhanced videos of 1998 versions, came lyrics booklet, and a little sticking adhesive of Eddie Hunter. <br />  Highly Recommended!!!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|...with Decemberunderground, AFI's latest and greatest album. Wow. The band has come so far in so little time. From whiny Sum 41-ish chords and boyish vocals found in their older efforts, to the grandiose goth-horror presentation that drives Sing the Sorrow, AFI had changed. For the better I might add. And then comes Decemberunderground. A passionate, undefiably eerie blast to the past, it reflects on their influences you might not expect, such as Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, and especially the Cure. This is the lost cure album, hands-down, which isn't to say it isn't also strictly AFI. If you think that this isn't AFI, Kill Caustic will probably change your mind pretty fast. But if you think that this is Very proud of ya pt. 2, pack your things up and go him. With a production budget as large as their wallets, AFI has set out to create the most epic album of all time. Did they succeed? Well, they just got beat out by Underoath in that book, but each song is a musical roller coaster filled with twists and turns you would never find. The Killing Lights is definitely a Just Like Heaven clone. No matter. It is possibly the best song on the album. Hardcore fans won't even recognize this AFI. Davey obviously opted out some of his cherished goth rock for pure New Wave. In fact, this is the most New Wave any album has been since the late 80s. Fuggidaboutit Killers. AFI has trumped you in the New Wave department, while remaining strictly punk and undeniably electronic as well. Techno influences are located everywhere, my favorite being in Love Like Winter. What AFI started with Death of Seasons they finish up on Decemberunderground. And the instrumentals are the highlight of the album. Jade has never sounded more electric, and Hunter's tremendous bass playing has finally taken center stage and flourished with this album. Overall, the best AFI has to offer, but there is definitely better things to come, and even more growth than ever before. One of the best albums ofthe year.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Okay, I know this barely came out at theaters, but does anyone have an inkling to when the DVD might come out? My sister and I are very excited for it!! I love Mater, he is the funniest, and Red, too.
630512762X|4.0|Now if you have seen movies like Hard Boiled, The Killer and so on, then get ready to see what happens when you give this guy a budget.  GUN FU HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER!!!!  The acting is superb as is the story telling.  The story itelf is more than unbelievable, but still fun.  Nicolas Cage and John Travolta put on  some of the best performance of their career.  The whole story with the kid is beautifully done, and the shootouts, oh man, you will watch this movie a few times.
3931141802|4.0|This is a wonderful monograph of Frank's early work, presented in a highly innovative sequence of images based loosly on formal and thematic topics.  The book's meaning grows and changes with every read.  Although it is hailed as a seminal work of progressive street photography now, it was not so warmly received in its postwar days.  For instance, in 1960 a critic for Popular Photography called it, \\"A sad poem for a sick people.\\"  However, Frank maintained an aloof political stance and managed to escape McCarthyism's career-ending scrutiny, unlike many of his coleagues.   <br />If you like this book, you might enjoy Walker Evans' \\"American Photographs\\" and Tod Papageorge's comparison of the two photo-books.  Also see Frank's later works, as seen in the retrospective \\"The Lines of My Hand\\" and such extensive exhibition catalogues as \\"Hold Still-Keep Going\\" and \\"Moving Out.\\"  Frank's later body of work reveals a preoccupation with the passage of time, perhaps inspired by his 40+ years in film.  These photos also bear negative scratching, collage, over-painting, and the deliberate addition of text--all of which vastly different from his Americans-era images.  Although these photographic accomplishments, stunning in their own right, have been ignored by scholarship for some time, the 1990s establishment of the Robert Frank Collection at the National Gallery promises to preserve as well as present Frank's later works in a new and interesting light. <br /> <br />Also: <br />Dear Benjamin, <br /> <br />Per your inquiry, Robert Frank's book was published in Switzerland because the photographer is SWISS.  Scalo has made an effort to publish most of Frank's books in his home country, as well as the US, England, France, Canada (where he lives now), etc.  Frank emigrated to the US in 1947 and became an American citizen in 1963.  Knowing these simple facts might help you examine this work with renewed clarity.  Also, people in Switzerland enjoy books just as much as Americans.Perhaps you should conduct some research every now and again, it might make you look less ignorant. <br />
B000BTJCRM|4.0|Wolf Mother might be the hardest rocking band to come from Australia since AC/DC. Don't let the Roger Dean-esque cover art fool you, these guys are not proggers. They are more Led Zeppelin than Yes, though the band incorporates just about every British classic rock sound there is. They take many notes from the Led Zep playbook, but you can also hear some Tull influences as well as much from the punk rock period. Wolf Mother's vocalist sounds like Jack White, and his bandmates play like up-tempo Black Sabbath. Imagine the White Stripes with a bassist and more drum fills and you have Wolf Mother. The band only goes slightly acoustic on a couple tracks here, and they are comfortable enough with there sound to throw in a bit of organ and flute-playing. Mostly, though, they rely on loud power chords. Not an album to be played softly. I'll be interested to see what they do on their next album.
B00004TWZF|5.0|The movie is an absolute must see but i actually like the music in the US version a little better. The director's cut made more sense but the music seemed to be very out of place and mood altering.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's American Idiot sets a new standard for Green Day and all other punk rock bands.  It begins with the rockin' \\"American Idiot\\", which takes to task America's obsession with the media.  Followed by \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", the first of two 9-minutes songs that sets the stage for the album's theme of disenchantment and alienation.  Traces of the Kinks and Mott the Hoople echo through this song, which is broken into parts much like the Who's \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\".  \\"Holiday\\" follows, an indictment of the Bush administration with thundering drums catchy guitar work. The pace slows with \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" with the haunting backing track and an anthemic finish.  \\"Are We the Waiting\\" highlights Billie Joe Armstrong's voice, which is in better form than on any other album.   \\"Saint Jimmy\\" is a strong, punk tune with fast guitar work and rolling drums that you can't help but move to.  Next is \\"Give me Novacaine, a slower song with a beat that will remind you of every prom you've ever attended.  \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" sing the praises of women who deal with the world today.  \\"Letterbomb\\" is an all-out rocker again with echoes of the Who in the power chords and melodic strumming of the guitar.  Things are slowed down again with \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", Billie Joe Armstrong's homage to his father, who died when Billie was 10 years old. Afer that is the second of the 9-minute songs, \\"Homecoming\\", which features solos by drummer Tre Cool and bassman Mike Dirnt, and brings the protagonist Jesus of Surburbia back home.  The final, \\"Whatsername\\" wraps up the saga with remembrances of lovers and things past.  A slow starter with a wonderful finish that shows the perfect harmony of Billie Joe's and Mike Dirnt's voices. <br /> <br />All-in-all, this album shows off the musicianship of Green Day, and the maturing of their musical talent.  This band has evolved into a full-on rock and roll band that equals any other, and surpasses a majority.  If you like Green Day, you must have this album in your collection.  If you like Rock, this album is essential.
B000002JS6|2.0|This album isn't terrible however, if it hadn't became legendary and sold over 10, 000 000 000 copies I probably wouldn't have reviewed this CD, but what drives me to write this review is because of the question mark that hovers above my head about how? And why? Everyone considers this CD to a classic and some kind of landmark.   <br /> <br />I bought this CD about half a year ago now and have given it many a listen, and I can honestly say that every time I haven't really enjoyed it that much.   None of the songs have any particular deep meaning to them with the exception of \\"Hell's Bell's\\", the drumming is pretty much the same on every song, the vocals are very tedious and difficult to listen to after a while and the guitar works good but their isn't much variation and generally sounds similar to a majority of the bands other material.   <br /> <br />Maybe I just don't understand \\"ACDC\\" that well or \\"Back In Black\\" was important back in 1980 when it was released and not now in 2006, but in my eyes it certainly isn't anything special. <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|I only review stuff when I really like it. If I feel strongly enough about it in a positive way then I'll take the time to write about it. Give Up is still a favorite of mine. For me, I pull this CD out on days I want to relax a bit. And I absolutely always make sure it's in the car for the long drives.
B0002DB50E|5.0|David Cronenberg was giving us a taste of things to come when he made this instant classic in the early '80's. Without the technology of today he still produced great effects; but the film gets its strength from the inner conflict of humans being not only contolled by technology, but actually becoming one with it. James Woods gives a good performance as the main character who takes the next step and is transformed into \\"the new flesh\\". Some of the same elements will be evident in the hallucinations of Naked Lunch and other films by Cronenberg as he sees the horrors of the world originate in the human mind. Highly recommended.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The extra 50 minutes are well worth viewing. It is my only copy of the film and it did not disappoint. The 'extra' lepracy storyline made a vivid contrast between a succeeding man wearing a mask and a young boy about to embark on a journey of great pain. His parent makes the decision of life itself.<br /><br />The camera view of listening characters responding to key passages was a little strained at times but again such views encourage a broader perspective from the viewer.<br /><br />The none widescreen TV aspect ratio is annoying but does not detract from what is an excellent dvd package. It still resonates.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. I love history, the Titanic, and romance, and this has all three. PLease, do not listen to the reviews that say \\"LEAVE OUT THE ROMANCE AND JUST SINK THE SHIP\\" Well, if you don't like romance, then DON'T SEE A ROMANCE MOVIE, IDIOTS! Also, they say that Rose is a sleazebag. Well, it's not like they got drunk, or somthing. For heavens sake, reviwers, review WELL.
B00009P1O5|5.0|Look here -<br /><br />When you see a bunch of people giving this 5 stars and falling all over themselves with superlatives, and then a bunch of other people giving it 1 star and calling it the worst album Neil Young ever made, you gotta know something interesting is going on...<br /><br />Reactor is perhaps best for listeners who have enough self-esteem that they are happy to be thought fools for enjoying something like Reactor...that is, listeners who can let go enough to enjoy music that has been stripped of all the trappings we ordinarily think of as nuance and sophistication.<br /><br />Moronic? Repetetive? Relentlessly inane?  Maybe so, or much of it.  But after all, what is \\"T-Bone\\" but the lyrical equivalent of the great one-note guitar solo?  And I'd be willing to bet these folks who are so disappointed in Reactor think \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" is a brilliant song, and never even realized the guitar solo was a one-noter (talk about an over-rated song...blech)<br /><br />I personally found it very refreshing that with Reactor, Young felt he could largely scrap his quasi-sophisticated sentimentalism just for once, and be satisfied to rock for rock's sake. (He's somebody, satisfied with winning...)  No, you won't be getting another \\"Harvest\\" here, or even something as brilliant as \\"Tonight's the Night.\\"  Reactor is far more dangerous and uncompromising.  It's just a pure freaking melt-down of an album, and deserves to be recognized as one of Young's best pieces of work.  Turn it up.  Louder.
0060899190|4.0|If you like visiting the website, or have never even seen it before, this book is a perfect compliment to the hard work frank warren has done.  The postcards are amazing and the book is eye-opening to a lot of different situations, both the same and different from your own.
0375410341|4.0|This book was very captivating. Don't be fooled by its length, however, because there are a lot of extras, such as an index and two appendices. The typographic layout of the book is revolutionary, though it wastes a lot of paper. I must say that this book really exercised my mind. I felt intrigued throughout the novel, but at the end I was disappointed there wasn't a more objective answer to the Navidson's house of the paranormal. I would, however, recommend this novel to anyone looking for something fresh and interesting.
0380799006|5.0|i found it very clear and complete, easy to read but also useful and with a lot of good ideas
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Here I am looking at a promo poster from the 1995 VHS release of the origial trilogy. It was given out at a few stores on the day the VHS's were made available. A hard to find item, for sure. Contact me if you want a photo of it. It says, \\"The original. One last time.\\" I got it framed and loved having it. Now it's a lie. Jeez!
B00005JO9J|4.0|I recently became a Grey's fan during Season 2 and purchased Grey's Season 1 for background info.  The first season is great too.
B000301YY8|5.0|I'm very picky and I have a short attention span with music.  It takes me about a minute to get bored of a song before changing it.  And I normally end up liking only 2 or 3 tracks in a whole album.  But this album... Wow!  It's the kind of album you can just leave playing without touching the skip button!  It's great if you want to just enjoy some good sounds; and it's even better if you want to hear some great lyrics.  James Blunt writes his own music so when he sings you can hear and feel the emotion pouring out of him.  He's a true artist and a total pleasure.  I really recommend this CD.  Enjoy! :)
B00068CVJ4|4.0|Omar's high woman-ish but extremely awsome voice hasn't quite shown itself that much in this CD. Songs like \\"Mannequin Republic\\" and \\"Non-zero possibility\\" are probably what got him the idea for Mars Volta. If thats you'r favorite part about At the Drive-In you should definitly look into some Mars Volta. But don't think of them as an \\"underdeveloped Mars Volta\\" because they differ in many ways and have more of a EMO style.
B00005JP4W|4.0|No matter what Al Gore's motivations may have been in making this movie, it is a carefully crafted, well-articulated, science-based, superbly visual presentation of what almost all respected and Nobel Prize-winning scientists have been saying for some time, that we are going through a period of global warming that is caused by greenhouse emission in the atmosphere.<br /><br />His style is relaxed, articulate and sincere as he explains the threat of increased carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. He explains this in such a way that he can hold an intelligent audience while still explaining things for those who may need more time to understand. He manages to make his message without losing anyone.<br /><br />This is made easier by his colorful and effective use of graphics that invite comparisons and trends. Vice President Gore always remains the focus of attention and uses the visuals to support his message. It is a very persuasive documentation.<br /><br />The one part I did not care for was Mr. Gore discussing his family's prior income from tobacco and his sister's death from lung cancer caused by smoking. While he may have been very close to her in life, I think grief should be more private, so I found this a bit heavy-handed. Thus, four stars.<br /><br />I admit to having read some of the one-star tirades, and could address them, but I think it is better to ignore them. I hope you will too, and buy the DVD. Maybe you will invite one of them over to watch it with you!<br /><br />One more thing, I never looked at my watch.
B000002G7G|3.0|Don't get me wrong, folks, The Velvet Underground is perhaps the greatest band of all time. This album, though, it just dosen't live up to The V. U. and Nico, and White Light/White Heat... <br />Let me put it this way <br />In the early days of The Velvets, there was John Cale. There was Lou Reed. It was the greatest music combo the world had to offer. Lou Reed would write elaborate, moving lyrics as John Cale composed intricate, brilliant songs. They pumped out The Velvet Underground and Nico, delivering incredible life changing classics such as \\"Heroin\\", \\"Venus in Furs\\", and \\"Black Angel's Death Song\\". They stayed strong as they released White Light/White Heat along with their excellent guitar player Sterling and a loyal drummer Maureen. It all fell apart though, this team. John left. Lou Reed, an incredible man that could do incredible things, could not perform these amazing things without Cale. It went downhill. He threw these soft instrumental riffs and whiney, un-Lou Reed-like vocals to make the self titled album. The Velvet Underground was built on noise, raging amplifaction, some-what offensive yet epic lyrics, and perfect instrument lines and melodies. This album is well done, and it has some okay songs (\\"What Goes On\\" is a wonderful track) but its just whimpey love songs that didn't appeal to me. After that Loaded was an improvment, but it was never the same when Cale left.  <br />The Velvet Underground is a nice one to have, I can find some of the songs listenable, but The Velvet Underground and Nico is vastly greater than this. Start with that. Thanks
0060899190|4.0|****<br />This collection of post cards of \\"secrets\\" sent to the author is more than just a coffee table book.  It is a testament to the universality of human emotions and the human experience---fears, guilt, regret, and loneliness especially.  Oftentimes as I read, thought, \\"I've felt just this way!\\"  Some of the secrets are profound and some are trivial , but all are secrets that one can relate to and have compassion for.<br /><br />It is not a depressing, but an uplifting book, in that seeing how we are all the same somehow paradoxically makes us feel less alone.  It is a very honest book.  And it is a beautiful book, too, because the post cards are made creatively to express the feelings the post card writer wants to convey.<br /><br />It is a great book to pick up and read in one sitting (as I did in a couple of hours) or just to browse a couple here and there when you have a few moments.  It is also a great book for those of us who are introspective and enjoy exploring our \\"shadow side\\".<br /><br />Kudos to Frank Warren, the author, for thinking of such a creative idea that can benefit so many people.  It is still worth buying the book, though, in my opinion, because of the overall impact of the book when read in one sitting, and because a hardcopy is so much easier to share with others.<br />**** [...]

1594481938|3.0|Seems to be a habit of mine that I don't get around to reviewing Hornby novels until a month or two after I've read them. Still, I suppose Nick would be sympathetic to the last disruption being watching far too much world cup football.<br /><br />So casting detail aside my hazy impressions were that this was good, but not as good as About a Boy, How to be Good or High Fidelity. As ever his characters and dialogue felt authentic, like he was imagining people he'd met, and he's clever, enjoyable and occasionally insightful. However in this book he seems to have pretty much thrown them together to see what popped up - particularly with the Lodge technique of writing from the perspective of different characters. This has its pleasures but I would have enjoyed the greater coherence of his other books. Perhaps that's partly deliberate: there isn't a simple structure to apply to suicidal thoughts, and to have his characters do any less than bumble around unsuccessfully working it out as they go would be misleading. Still, I suppose I liked the reality to be tempered by the freedom of fiction: transcripts of diaries of suicidal people (there are probably myriad blogs that cover this by now) may be interesting and educational, but they're hardly a novel.<br /><br />OK, sure, he does get to throw his characters into unlikely situations, and we do get the interaction, but I would have like him taking the solid material of this book as the basis for telling a story.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie is a different kind of comedy than most. I've come to the same conclusion as a lot of other reviewers have. This movie is either loved or hated. There is no middle ground. I absolutely love this movie. I could watch it all day, everyday. But then there are people like my girlfriend who can sit through the movie and not even crack a smile. She says its stupid and not at all funny. I can't pin point the reason that people can have such different opinions about a movie. But since I'm writing this and I loved it, it gets five stars. Will Ferrell is hilarious in this and Steve Carell had me rolling on the floor. The one liners in this movie were fantastic. My friends and I quote this movie to death. If you haven't seen it, rent it first before you buy it. Just in case you fall in the \\"haters\\" group for this movie. However, if you enjoy the comedic genius of the following, go buy it immediatly. If you love Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Jack Black, and/or Luke Wilson...you will love this movie.
B0009P42S2|4.0|Made by the same creator of the hugely popular, and genera revolutionizing, Akira.  Strangely, this film is set in England during the industrial revolution.  Sepia tones make for an excellent mood, and the visual effects alone make this movie worth watching.  Yet, what makes this film so intriguing is how it sets up a unique juxtaposition between the `old feel' of 19th century England, and the `new feel' of high paced, technologically extravagant, modern day science fiction film... Sort of like Charles Dickens meets The Matrix.
B000002KDO|5.0|I've been hypnotized by Ozzy & Sabbath for years.  This album is at least as good as Paranoid and for sure better than their first self-titled album and better than Volume IV.  Riff-meister Iommi continues to pull awesome riffs out of his left-handed guitar on this beautifully dark masterpiece.<br /><br />I won't go over the tracklist as others have already done a great job here, but I do want to mention that this album has the most consitently awesome songs over all of their other Ozzy-era albums.  The arrangement of the tracks just flows from one into the next.<br /><br />My favorite Black Sabbath song happens to be on this album, \\"Children of the Grave\\".  I never get tired listening to it.  The lyrics are written such that the song is just as relevant today as it was back in the Cold War years.  The song is a warning and at the same time inspires hope in the current generation.  The fantastic drumming by Bill here on the track is the icing on the cake.  When the opening riff swirls into the first verse, your imagination really takes over.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|We've all seen it, but when is the last time you went back and `re-watched' it as an adult.  This movie is, in my opinion, quite possibly the greatest movie ever made.  Truly magical, timeless, endlessly entertaining.  It's got songs, dancing, laughing, crying, animation, live action, special effects, great acting (minus Dick Van Dyke's attempted `cockney accent'), and a great story.  What more can be said?  Walt Disney's finest cinematic achievement, at least while he was living, and his most deliberate work of `magic.'
0380977273|2.0|I can't believe the constant showboating of the writing in this book. The metaphors per paragraph (MPP) is just ridiculous and totally distracting from the story. Simile and metaphor are meant to communicate meaning. In this book, however, many of them, while sounding interesting or \\"peotic,\\" simly don't do their real job, which is to help tell the story. Or maybe that's the problem - the story isn't very interesting so the author hopes to distract the reader from that fact with the spastic writing style. Bradbury here writes like a college kid whose only real chance of getting laid is by impressing some girl in his creative writing class. Really sad; I thought Bradbury was better that this. He apparently needed - and went without - a reasonable editor who certainly would have taken him out in the parking lot and slapped him around until he remembered what writing was supposed to sound like. Real writers use literary devices sparingly, if at all. And when they do, they make sure they are dead-on and impactful. Ray, read a little Carver or Hemingway before you write another next 70 pages of pap. If I sound irritated, I am.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This film was a widely popular, major blockbuster release.  Although, it seems as though it fell a little `flat' with most audiences.  Not so much a `superhero' film as it is a psychological study of repression.  It is for this reason that I think this is such a fantastic film.  In my opinion, Ang Lee has single handedly managed to revolutionize the comic book genera.  Don't get me wrong, I think the recent comic films (e.g. Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, and the X-men movies) have all been excellent films with good plots.  But this film is different.  If people could move past their `preconceptions' about `the Hulk character,' in all probability, this film would have had a more direct appeal to fans of intelligent psychological thrillers, opposed to your usual comic book audience (...even though I readily admit that a level of sophistication can be found in many comics and comic films).
6305897786|5.0|Ah..., the left-hand path, how delicious! This is one of the best, decidedly occult films I've seen in a long time. What self proclaiming occultist wouldn't be fascinated with the concept of the existence of a rare book titled, The Ninth Gate, claimed to be co-authored by Lucifer. Only three are said to exist. A wealthy American occultist named Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) has obtained one copy. He hires nefarious book seller Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) to travel to Europe and examine the other two copies to see if they are originals, or forgeries. At least that's the reason he gives to the unexpecting book dealer.<br /><br />Amazing film, dark, evil, atmospheric and hypnotic from beginning to end. You almost expect Aleister Crowley or Kenneth Grant to step out of the shadows at any moment. It gives me goose bumps just to think about it.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is magnificent. Also strong performances by Lena Olin, Frank Langella and Emmanuelle Seigner.<br /><br />A thinking persons occult movie. Highly Recommended!
B00005QEO1|3.0|you'll sure enjoy Pump too! I was hesitant about getting this album as I thought that Permanent Vacation was so good for a \\"comeback\\" album that the band were bound to lose their lustre. However, I was wrong and Pump is every bit as enjoyable as Permanent Vacation. Great lively rock with some tracks you'll remember from the radio back in the late 80s / early 90s (Jamie's Got a Gun, Love in an Elevator). And it's not just these tracks that stand out, overall the album's quality is consistently good in and of itself.

0156029065|4.0|Of the four Eco books I've read (Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, Island of the Day Before, Baudolino) this is the most accessible and so it's a good place to start reading Eco and get a sense of his style of writing. What I liked most about this book is that (and I can say this without spoiling the plot!) because Baudolino states at the outset that he is a liar, the reader has to interpret the truth of the text as the story unfolds. This extends the book beyond the usual one-dimensional reading of fiction. If you like books to be bigger in this way then Eco is your man, and I'd also recommend Milorad Pavic. But let's not get carried away, here's a good place to start!
B00005JOML|5.0|I am one of those 80's child who grew up with Miami Vice and Ferraris, and this movie is sure to bring back a lot of memories! Even though there is some negative publicity surrounding Jamie Foxx on the set, I am sure it would not affect the success of the movie in anyway! Viva Miami!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|This is by far the most seductive album of the summer.  Though the single \\"put your records on\\" is a great uplifting track, I think the hidden secret of this album is \\"Til it happens to you.\\"  Her voice is so enrapturing and her lyrics have some definite weight to them.  With many female vocalists out there, it's refreshing to find one that has such poise and grace throughout her entire album.  If you like Corinne's smooth sounds also check out Gretchen Lieberum and her new release \\"Siren Songs,\\" a hidden gem in the female vocal world.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I understand some fans may think Lucas is just trying to make more money off the fans and you're right he is. However I'm still going to purchase the new releases. I own the original un tampered trilogy on VHS and have been waiting a long time to get it on DVD. I agree with another reviewer that I prefer the old Ewok song at the end of ROTJ and the smaller celebration at Endor. However, I also like some of the enhancements to the 2004 versions and I don't own them, so I feel this is a good opportunity for fans like me to have my cake and eat it too.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The prequel trilogy begins it's legacy of contradicting the original with a bang. Jar-Jar Binks and poop jokes abound, it only proves to show that Star Wars has no idea who they're target audiance is. Two movies later, the main character will be killing children, will lose all of his limbs and have the flesh burnt from his body. <br /> <br />It's a non-stop parade of characters from the original trilogy because this movie simply cannot stand on it's own. The acting, dialogue, editing, and plot are terrible beyond words. The movie is filler, and nothing else. They wanted to show Anakin joining the Jedi Order and he didn't do anything important until he was a Jedi Knight. Rather than skip ahead ten years he decided to waste our time with trade routes, a half-baked droid army scheme, \\"slap stick\\" antics and a constant barrage of puns.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I don't know where to start to even say how awesome this film is. I will just say this is what Tim Burton COULD NOT do back in 1989, nor could he really do it now either. I do like Burton's take but it was very shallow in terms of what makes Batman tick (Tim has always been all style and no substance), Nolan on the other hand gives us what we all wanted and that is the man behind the cowl, the motivation and lessons learned to make him the Knight that he is. Nolan delivers a great cast with a great scrpit, all told with great direction. The years spent making taunt psychological/film nior films like Memento and Insomnia have all lead up to this and Chris did not fail in the least bit. Bale makes the most promising Batman and Bruce Wayne since the casting news of Michael Keaton, whom would go on to drop the ball as Batman in the Burton films along with Jack Nicholson dropping The Joker too (sorry Jack DID NOT KNOW how The Joker should be). Along with Bale there are some very good actors fleshing out, and I mean fleshing out the roles of some of Gotham's citizen such as Micahel Cain(Alfred), Gary Oldman(Gordon) and Cillian Murphy(Dr.Crane/Scarecrow) just to name a few. The use of actual sets and stunt scenes are most welcomed instead of being once again exposed to CGI. <br />I know there are people that will argue that this movie was too long or boring, and if they do they just don't get it. And if they are like me and have read the comics of Batman and still say they don't get it, then there just might be a room in Arkham for them.
B00003CXCT|2.0|The changes make this unwatchable. Only The Empire Strikes Back made it out okay.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|I don't know exactly what happened to one of my favorite bands but I know they aren't to be found on this latest release. Up to now I have been buying the albums when they come out, and I have been less than impressed. The band has not had a great studio album since Vs came out. Now don't get me wrong the other albums have there moments, hell even Yield was good in the midst of all that muddle, but this album is just junk. At this point in life it is hard, VERY HARD to believe Vedder and crew are still angry and feeling unwanted after selling millions of records and quite honestly being FLITHY RICH. They are just like their hero Neil, still acting like they are against the system yet at the top of the finanical food chain.  <br />The very last song is the best and shows the kind of soundscape and experimenting the rest of the tracks should have been. I am sure that this stuff sounds just fine live, it always does, that is why I bought the albums in the past, cause I have caught this band quite a few times and yes they are a live band. They should just start putting out the new material as live albums and save my ears the pain.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|After i heard that headly had left the band i thought i wasn't going to see this band again. so to see that the band was up and working was great to see. but not much can be said about the work. fieldy's role which i think is very vital for the band and the genre they play has been greatly reduced here. its more hard rock than proper nu-metal. the guitar works are not as intricate as they used to be. well i guess every band needs to change... metallica for eg. did and paid heavily. i think its cool to define your music but it should be something you really wanted to do not just for money. <br /> <br />to me twisted trans. sounds like their radio hit word up.. coming undone another radio friendly track. actually its filled with stuff that is aimed at the mass. its actually a good try if you don't like nu-metal. otherwise you can get this album listen to it and bury it. <br /> <br />neverthless this album is probably the best releases of 2005 (next to audioslave's out of exile). its definetly not one of those albums which is seriously bad. its pretty cool. but it ain't no evolution of heavyness as it claims. <br /> <br />Verdict: A fun album when driving. <br />
0060764899|4.0|I loved this book as a child. I remember having it read to me when I was six. Of course, I was oblivious to the Christian theology running through it at the time, and in later books some of the references to other races is questionable. But this first book remains a classic and an innovator. If you enjoyed it try reading Lightsleep by Matthew S. Batham, a new fantasy about a bratty boy who finds himself in another world.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One of the most unexpectedly pleasant movie surprises I've had this year was the Wachowski Brothers' brilliant screen adaptation of the DC Comics graphic novel, V For Vendetta.  <br /> <br />It's not often you find yourself somewhat moved by something advertised as a Hollywood popcorn action movie, but V For Vendetta had that exact effect on me. After seeing the movie (twice), I bought the graphic novel and devoured it in about a day. <br /> <br />You see, even if it has been somewhat cleverly dressed up as a Hollywood popcorn movie, V For Vendetta is clearly a movie with a point to make. It's a story that has been told numerous times before (though not nearly enough lately given the times we live in) of the people rising up against an oppressive government. The closest comparison you would find in literature would be something like George Orwell's 1984. <br /> <br />The paradox of V For Vendetta lies in it's hero and central character, the mysterious (and sympathetic) masked terrorist known only as \\"V,\\" expertly played beneath the mask by Hugo Weaving.  <br /> <br />V is something of a cross between the masked serial killers of slasher fare, like Friday the 13th and Halloween, and the avenging angels of Reagan-era action movies like RoboCop and The Terminator. But in between blowing up government buildings to symphonic soundtracks and slicing and dicing his enemies with his ever so trusty knives, V is also something of a renaissance man.  <br /> <br />He quotes Shakespeare, lives in a crypt like underground \\"Shadow Gallery\\" filled with priceless artifacts banned by the government, and dances alone to the torchy slow jazz songs on his own personal jukebox. <br /> <br />But \\"V\\" is no angel.  <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it. \\"V\\" is a terrorist who has a vendetta with an agenda, which is what makes this such a fascinating film. You see, \\"V\\" is a sympathetic terrorist. Remember that scene in the movie \\"Independence Day\\" when the aliens blew up the White House? That scene actually had movie audiences cheering in the theatres. When V blows up the British Parliament, you likewise actually find yourself cheering him on, which is no small accomplishment given the post 9/11 era in which we live. <br /> <br />In a not too distant future, America has been destroyed by civil war and England is ruled by the iron fist of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt, who ironically played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of Orwell's 1984), with the aid of jackbooted goons called \\"The Fingermen,\\" headed up by a very nasty guy named Creedy. <br /> <br />As the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that the rise to power of Sutler, Creedy, and company comes through the exploitation of fear created by a national crisis that, as it turns out, they manufactured themselves. This may all sound quite familiar if you follow the various conspiracy theories floating about on the Internet about 9/11. <br /> <br />Anyway, it turns out that \\"V\\" was rounded up with the rest of the minorities, homosexuals, and other undesirables and placed in an internment camp once the goons took over. In the internment camp, some very nasty medical experiments took place which V survived. And now, V is pissed. <br /> <br />After he rescues damsel in distress Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), an employee of the state run propaganda television network, from an attempted rape by a couple of the Fingermen goons, \\"V\\" takes her to the rooftops to watch him blow up a government building.  <br /> <br />\\"Do you like music?\\" V asks Evey in one of this film's several great lines of dialogue as the 1812 Overture blares the soundtrack to the fireworks over loud speakers in the streets. <br /> <br />But V is just getting warmed up. <br /> <br />Turns out \\"V\\" has taken a cue from his spiritual mentor, 16th Century Catholic Guy Fawkes (whose mask he wears), and has decided to send a message to his oppressors by blowing up the British Parliament building on November 5th (the anniversary of Fawkes' original attempt to do the same). Leading up to that event, he slices and dices his way through an array of villains ranging from the fascist government's television propaganda mouthpiece to everyone's favorite pedophile Catholic priest. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, with the none too subtle assistance of \\"V\\" himself, Evey has her own spiritual and political epiphany and becomes his accomplice. <br /> <br />As I noted above, there are so many great lines of dialogue in this movie. I couldn't begin to note them all, but here are a few of my favorites: <br /> <br />\\"A revolution without dancing isn't one worth having.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Beneath this mask lies an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.\\" <br /> <br />And my personal favorite: <br /> <br />\\"People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.\\" <br /> <br />Though cleverly disguised as a popcorn action picture, V For Vendetta is a movie that makes you think. Even as it entertains you by blowing things up and slicing and dicing it's way through all the bad guys (loved the knife trails in the fight scenes), there is a definite statement being made: <br /> <br />Question authority. <br /> <br />The double disc DVD comes with some great extras, too. In addition to a short documentary on the making of the film, there are features on the new wave of comics focusing on the eighties and nineties rise of the graphic novels which spawned V For Vendetta, as well as a history piece on the Guy Fawkes backstory which inspired it. <br /> <br />V For Vendetta is a thinking man's action picture. I loved this movie in the theatres and I loved watching it at home. It comes to your nearest video store August 1.
B000687M48|5.0|For a \\"live\\" performance, Amy Lee's vocals are just amazing.  The lyrics are deep, the sound is heavy, and most importantly, the music is musical.  So, amazing it's beautiful. <br /> <br />The DVD contains the live recording of her concert in Paris, France.  Great venue.  (I wonder if its the same venue that The Cranberries shot their Live Concert?!?!) <br /> <br />There are also copies of her 4 music videos. <br /> <br />The behind the scene's stuff is great.  Most of the time when you look at the \\"behind the scene\\" stuff from other DVDs, its just boring and stupid.  It's like watching home videos of people you don't know.  BUT, this one is just hilarious!  You also get a more candid interview of the band and look into their life on tour.  Just watch it.  You'll see what I mean.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Topping Madonna's The Girlie Show and U2's Zoo TV for mega stage spectacles of the early 1990s, Pink Floyd's Division Bell tour finally emerges on DVD. The tour, which unofficially marks Pink Floyd's retirement from the live arena, not only wowed audiences with amazing screen visuals, laser effects and lighting but also included startling oddities such as inflatable pigs, floating spaceships and burning planes. Offering a wealth of extras and sound options, Pulse remains a staggering visual production more than a decade on, with the band performing key albums The Division Bell and The Dark Side Of The Moon almost in their entirety. \\"I suppose we better get on with it then,\\" Pink Floyd frontman David Gilmour grumbles after a mammoth introductory version of Syd Barrett tribute Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with the subsequent lavish Storm Thorgerson visuals elevating classic Floyd tracks as High Hopes and Another Brick In The Wall and neatly complementing the stereo assault of this pristine DVD. Pink Floyd: after all, they're only extraordinary men.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|OUTSTANDING!!!! Just got back from her amazing \\"Confessions\\" concert in Miami. She brought this album to life. It sounds 10 times better to me now. If you are a Madonna fan, this is definitely an album for your collection. Every song is a hit and you will find at least one track that speaks directly to you. I LOVE THIS ALBUM and you will too.
6305268843|5.0|This is an exceptional period in the Jane Austen style.  Everyone else here has established the plot, but I can just add that if you like Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility you will like this film.  It will tug at your heart strings, and make you laugh.  My wife and I really loved this film.  I wish it was available on DVD in widescreen format ... maybe someday!
B00008WT5M|3.0|This is a HUGE improvement over 80's albums such as Flick of the Switch, Blow Up Your Video and For Those About to Rock. It still feels kind of uninspired, but at least it contains three of my AC/DC favorites: Thunderstruck, Moneytalks and the title track, plus Fire Your Guns. But it dies out after this, and AC/DC churns out pointless song after pointless song. It's an improvement, though.
1932100660|4.0|It was a good book, very readable and engaging. However, it dealt only briefly with the China Study he helped to conduct. When he talked about his findings, he did it in a very generalised way, more to sell a \\"point\\" (eat a whole food, vegan diet) rather than to convey the nuances of his findings. This was disappointing. <br /> <br />However, there was some interesting (and scary) discussions about how excess protein in the blood can trigger cancer growth, and the havoc that cow's milk can wreak on children. <br /> <br />I'm giving the whole foods vegan diet the one month trial (as he suggests), just to see how I feel on it. He's given plenty of evidence here (through other studies, not just his own) that it can reverse diabetes, heart disease and cure obesity, and for those reasons alone, it's worth experimenting with.
B000HBK1TM|5.0|Miles Davis has been responsible for many fantastic records, and this definitely belongs in the first rank of them. It might not be as good as Kind of Blue or In a Silent Way, but it's still one of my most-played Miles Davis albums. Other than the mediocre but enjoyable \\"Tadd's Delight,\\" every song here is classic Miles.<br />The album starts off with \\"'Round Midnight,\\" the definitive version of an already classic Monk tune. Miles' pensive muted trumpet carries the song's odd but gorgeous melody, and Coltrane kicks things into high gear with an explosive solo. Then the song settles down into moodiness once more. After that comes \\"Ah-Leu-Cha,\\" a furious cover of Charlie Parker's bop classic. Philly Joe Jones' madman drumming is the big highlight of the song, though the weird melody also deserves mention. And, for another violent contrast, \\"All of You\\" is a swinging pop song, highlighted by the sensitive interplay between Miles, Trane, and bassist Paul Chambers.<br />And then there's side two, which contains my two favorite songs on the record. His cover of \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" is my pick for the album's best song, and one of the greatest tunes of Miles' whole career. It's genius, right from Red Garland's brilliant piano intro. The solos are wonderful, the melody is made beautiful by Miles' mute, and I love the sad-but-optimistic vibe it gives off. \\"Tadd's Delight\\" is a bit of a letdown, but the melody's nice enough, and it's not a bad song. Besides, the closing \\"Dear Old Stockholm\\" makes up for it. The bass playing, Coltrane's explosive solo, and the melody (which eventually becomes a harmony part) come together to make it a jazz classic.<br />This is an unbeatable album. It's one of my most-played Miles Davis albums, and it's also one of his best. An essential for any Miles fan, or any jazz fan in general.
0553588486|5.0|If you're just getting into the fantasy genre, don't read this novel, yet.  I think one has to experience some of the grade A suck out there before one can truly appreciate how awesome Martin is.  I would guess that over half of Martin's readers are jaded Robert Jordan fans who just could not take one more description of a woman smoothing her skirts.<br /><br />  What makes Martin so great, you ask (I'm assuming here, you might not be)?  Many things, but above all else it's characterization.  Everyone, even minor players, are fleshed out and crafted into believable human beings.  Now, there are a lot of people moving about in Martin's world.  At first you might be a little bit overwhelmed, but something incredible happens as you move further through the novel.  You actually remember a lot of them.  Why?  Because Martin took the time to make them living, breathing individuals.  And they're not just unique, they're unbelievably complex for a fantasy novel.  You want real strong female leads?  Martin gives you Daenerys, Arya, and Cat.  You want a roaring, drunken king reminiscent of Alexander the Great if he'd lived to forty?  Martin bestows upon us Robert Baratheon.  You want the GREATEST antihero ever to grace the fantasy genre?  Ask, and you shall receive Sandor Clegane, The Hound.<br /><br />  Game of Thrones is a character-driven novel, but behind that you have a world, although largely copied from history, that feels like an actual place.  Magic is downplayed in this first novel, but becomes much more prominent as the series progresses.  And, best of all, Martin doesn't employ some contrived system.  Believe it or not, magic is actually mysterious and, get this, magical.<br /><br />  One criticism that has been laid against Martin is that he is too merciless with his major characters.  Things continually happen in this series and many of those things are people dying.  But the deaths always seem...right.  They always contribute to the story and press the characters forward.  As I said before, things are always happening.  The plot doesn't stagnate like in some larger series.<br /><br />Anyone who likes fantasy novels needs to pick this series up.  Soon, Robert Jordan will fall into obscurity and George RR Martin will rise into his place.  If only it had happened sooner.e characters forward.  As I said before, things are always happening.

I know I'm dreaming with Night Flight, Boogie With Stu and Bron-Yr-Aur, but along with Ten Years Gone they make up the best of Physical Graffiti - in my mind anyway, though few will agree with that perspective. (that being said, I am a fan of Kashmir, Trampled Underfoot and Houses of the Holy). And why no one's thought of including Traveling Riverside Blues or Hey Hey What Can I Do on a Zeppelin collection is beyond me. Early Days and Latter Days still makes for the ideal overview of Zeppelin, arguably the most overrated band that I can tolerate.
0552998486|4.0|Vianne Rocher blows in to the small French town of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes on the Caranval wind, the final celebration before Lent begins. On the first day of Lent, the season where Catholics traditionally take vows of abstinence and fast, she opens a delightful, beguiling chocolate shop that, much to the chagrin of Reynaud, the town priest, becomes a favorite to many townsfolk. Vianne and her shop seem to exude an influence on the town and its people as Josephine finally finds the strength to confront an abusive husband, Armande's friendship with Vianne blooms over into other parts of her life, and changes in spirit and personality--even slight--seem to magically stir change. Even Reynaud has a bout with temptation.  <br /> <br />Chocolat is an enchanting story filled with folklore and magical realism as well as real life situations and people. The religious current, especially as told through the voice of and seen through the eyes of Reynaud, moves through a spooky labyrinth of guilt, denial, self-righteousness, pity, fear, hatred, and loathing, with surprises around each corner.  <br />

0380713802|3.0|Bill Bryson has a talent for turning his travel adventures into a humorous celebration of the obscure, the bizarre and the frustrating. He has a keen and often sarcastic eye for what will entertain the seasoned armchair traveler, and books like `Down Under' and `Notes from a Small Island' are filled with hilarious anecdotes and interesting insights into the areas he is exploring. Unfortunately `Neither Here nor There' is not as engaging or amusing as many of Bryson's other efforts, and seems like a rather hotch-potch attempt to fill a book with as many destinations as possible. <br /> <br />With around 25 destinations visited in `Neither Here nor There', Bryson does not have the time or room to exercise his trademark ability to unearth unusual facts and figures. He seems to rush around Europe and not greatly enjoy his travels, although a large beer and a big meal often appears to soothe his frazzled spirits. One thing that surprised me was that Bryson proudly refuses to learn even the most basic foreign phrases, which seems a little rude and ignorant. I started to suspect that this is partly because he relies upon language-barrier humor a little too much. He also does not meet with locals a great deal in this book, denying us the Bryson knack for meeting people who are either a little odd, or filled with fascinating information.  <br /> <br />Although I did still enjoy parts of `Neither Here nor There' immensely, I found myself occasionally wanting to skip a chapter or two, which saddened me as I am a great admirer of many of Bryson's other books. I ended the book feeling I didn't know a great deal more about the cities he visited, and that the book was more an attempt to gather enough material for publication rather than a great travel story that needed to be shared.
0440241413|5.0|This is my all time favorite girly book.  If you even like to shop at all, you will be able to relate to the constant dilemmas of the Shopaholic.  It is an easy book to read and enjoyable.  It is predictable but still good.  I have reall all of the Shopaholic and this was my favorite.  I also liked Shopaholic in Manhattan as much.  If you go on after that, give some time in between or it becomes too repetitive.
0684824906|5.0|When it seems that more and more books are being written with an ever narrowing focus - a battle, a speech, \\"A Day in the Life ...\\" - it's a pleasure to pick up an old fashioned well researched and well written history that one can sink his or her teeth into. Team of Rivals is just such a book. Although per se there is nothing \\"startling\\" or \\"new\\" in this biography, the author's perspective/premise - examining Lincoln's growth, evolution, his success(es) and failures in conjunction with the members of his Cabinet - does yield a fascinating look into the multi-faceted character/mind of Abraham Lincoln and proves that 140+ years after his untimely death there is still much to learn from this man. Because of this, Team of Rivals is a welcome and worthy addition to the ever growing catalog of Lincoln history. The only caveat I have in recommending this book would be to a reader who wanted to start here in understanding this complicated time in U.S. history. The amount of information and the number of topics covered might be overwhelming. (Starting with other Lincoln bios by Guelzo or Donald; Battle Cry of Freedom by McPherson on the US Civil War would provide background and are excellent books in their own right.)
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|I was very disappointed with this one. I was expecting a smart movie full of imagination and beautiful animation. Well, the animators did a great job, but the writing was really bad as was the direction. Most of the characters I didn't care about. The rest were just annoying. Like the pig. I was bored all through this movie.
B00003CXCW|5.0|SUNSET BOULEVARD is a drama that reveals the unsightly day-to-day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense. Joe Gillis (William Holden), a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers, holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. While walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool, he is shocked to discover it's occupied by old silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson).  <br /> <br />Living with a devoted chauffeur, estranged from Hollywood and forgotten by fans, in Desmond's mind, she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years. Knowing the script doesn't have a chance, as a writer, Joe looks at this as an opportunity to \\"fine tune\\" it to earn some extra cash. However, the working relationship is not all that tidy. It seems lonely Desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo. His payment is a warm place to stay at night, a closet full of clothes, nice meals, private \\"parties,\\" and Desmond's ever-present company. <br /> <br />If it were possible for Desmond's self-admiration to be supplanted by anything, it would be the possessiveness for Joe's affection. Young Joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend. Through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and, naturally, develop feelings for one another. The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge.  <br /> <br />With some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod, this is a wonderfully produced \\"noir-comic\\" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions, not only of each character, but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent. Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE, AN IMITATION OF LIFE, and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head. <br /> <br />Movie quote: \\"There's nothing tragic about being fifty. Not unless you're trying to be twenty-five.\\"
1576751988|2.0|Brian Tracy really has developed himself into a formula.  This book...though completely correct in its assersions...reads like one long fortune cookie.  If he of decided to name the book 31 great ways, you get the feeling he would have just made up ten more.<br /><br />It contains substance...but not necessarily wisdom.
B0000942HV|4.0|Well this album is the result of a long journey and my personal opinion is that it has those new small changes that makes it refreshing than Tubular Bells I, but of course the spontaneity and passion of Tubular Bells I is unique as well as many others <br />on those years; \\" It's a good album.\\" <br /> <br /> Well I think that Mike can deliver an insuperable music as he showed to us in \\" Songs of Distant Earth \\" and many others.
B00005JOML|1.0|This film is NOT based on the TV show. Michael Mann created the film as if the show had not existed.(L.A.Times) Word from the inside is that the film is pure garbage. As a fan of the show I will not be wasting my money on the film. Remakes of old television shows are a stupid idea, but I understand why Hollywood makes these films. People will buy into anything and Hollywood has not had a decent idea for new films in years.
B000E97X66|5.0|After owning a dozen or so Springsteen live CDs, I was not really excited when this was released to celebrate the 30th aniversary of Born to Run last year.Wow, a lot can change in a year. This monumental set has since become my all-time favorite rock set.     The band was so hungry focused and full of passion,well up to the task of winning over the hearts and minds of the cynical critics armed with pens and clipboards.     Perhaps only The Who could match Springsteen's sense of drama and anticipation. And eagerly anticipate I did thoughout the opening Thunder Road for the band to become unglued send the song to the heavens. Instead,the song remains a duet and Springsteen grinds with determination energy and passion and makes some of rocks greatest lyrics more audible and meaningful than on the orginal.     The band just flys into great version of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out. Who cares if not even the author himself knows what titlee lyrics mean, the song sounds still sounds fantastic.Spirit in the Night just rocks and by the way if your hair does not stand up on your back during Clarence Clemons sax solo disconnect the breathing machine and die with some dignity.  One of the joys of this set is hearing Born to Run in just out of the embryo, before the song went on to become the greatest rock anthem of all-time.     Side two opens with the rarely played live Kittys Back. This is the highlight of the album and possibly rock history. The jazz snob who resides within me cannot find anything to attack. Clearly, this is the best rock band ever formed and every musical group will be compared to the E Street Band a century from now.Roy Bittan is just a joke tearing up on the Moondance interlude.I can only wonder and speculate about Van Morrison hearing this and thinking \\"what have done to my baby\\" yet, all the time realizing only Bruce and company could improved something that sounded so perfect to begin with.  Jungleland sounds the closest to any of the orginals on this set perhaps because Springsteen spent so much time on the studio recording trying get this right. Clarence to this day is so grateful that Springsteen kept him doing take after take after take after take to get his fantastic and career changing solo just perfect.  Rosalita (Come out Tonite) is a showcase for Wax Weinberg's drumming only the Rolling Stones Charlie Watts close to him in the rock arena and both have obviously listened to substantal amount of jazz.  Sandy may be the weak point of the album the song wanders yet, never realy goes anywhere.  But, do not count this band out just yet.After Sandy they launch back into greatest band in the world form with a bullet in the name of Devil with a Blue Dress. The Detroit Medley also includes two sparkeling Little Richard covers which match originals,something the Beatles could never claim.I would have hate to be one the critics choosing between a deadline and a possible job and the what certainly was an overwelming desire to dance the night away.  The first encore, For You is another Springsteen Bitton Duet that is emotional lovely and sexy. I cannot imagine any female in the audiance not wanting to lick his sores as the lyrics invite.     Closing out the show is a stunning, nasty powerful version of Quarter to Three featuring a classic false-ending that rivals Otis Redding at Monterey.     Many people have wondered what would have happened if this had been released 1976. While I world politics would have not changed much, I do believe Frampton Comes Alive sales would have been meager at best. I mean who would choose a 15 minute voice-box workout over a real genuis at the height of his vast powers, on monumental night sympathectically supported by the best R&B,jazz and rock n roll in the land.

B0007GAEGC|4.0|I kept seeing bits of this on PBS so added this to my collection.  It will be in my \\"trip\\" rotation for our 6 disk changer.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|All of the songs on this DVD sound efing awesome. The version of Let there be rock along with a whole lotta rossie in this concert would have to be the best that I have ever heard them and that goes for any live version or studio version of these songs. The only thing missing is Bons voice. I think that if you could somehow remove Brians voice from these two songs and replace it with Bons voice from the IF YOU WANT BLOOD LIVE album  you would have the greatest ever version of these two songs.  Brians voices was at his near best during this performance, Although sometimes you can hear his voice break and loose a bit of power. But still not even worth complaining about. I give him 5 stars for his performance.  Angus put on a great performance, but he's not as agile as what he was in the 70's. If you want to see angus at his absolute best buy or hire a copy of the LET THERE BE ROCK DVD. This is Angus at his craziest, he goes absolutly spastic in this performance , just unbelievable. Its Angus like you'v never seen him before.  But still 5 stars for his perfomance in this vid.  I thought the rythim guitar lacked a bit of volume. At times it was overpowered by angus's guitar especially when he plaid a solo. During a solo I think the base stood out more than the rythim . So a about 30% more volume from Malcoms guitar would have been good.  I would have to say that this perfomance is mind blowing, so I rate this DVD 5 stars. One of the greatest live perfomances from any band ever.
B00005NP04|4.0|I kept hearing Independence Day on Sean Hannity so went searching for her.  I'm happy discovering a overall excellent listening CD.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Like hundreds of other comic book fans worldwide I was eager to watch SUPERMAN RETURNS on the theater. The very same feeling I also had about its music score, considering 'maestro's' John Williams masterpiece recorded for Richard Donner's 1978 blockbuster starring the late Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder. Well, may I say the waiting has worthed. Bryan Singer does a terrific job revisiting the original 1978 movie and John Ottman brings out a refreshing and vibrant score that pays a beautiful tribute to John William's work. I've just listened to the new score again, this time on the CD, and I can't stop repeating it over and over again on my player. I recomend this score to any true fan of the movie and the character. The Man of Steel is really back, folks. You can bet.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I'm convined. <br /> <br />I'm not a Beach boys fan but all the hype around this album made me listen to it. <br />It's wonderful, truly wonderful. There are only a few songs that can make me cry just thinking about them. One or two of them are on this album.  <br /> <br />Of course the classics are instantly likeable. Wouldn't it be nice & God only knows are on here, but listening to them close up makes you realise just what masterpieces they are. The arrangements are delicate & fresh (How Wilson uses the harp (?) intro of Wouldn't it be nice as the underlying melody in the bridge. Ahhh, simply beautiful!) & really unusual instrument sounds are used throughout the album to great effect.  <br /> <br />This is not to say that it's the `perfect' album. At the risk of copping flak, a couple of songs present production that sounds to me a little too much like demos for my liking. (Percussion that's not in rhythm, dead air in the mix). Some songs get away with it, others don't, but this is overshadowed by the overall brilliance of most of the songs. The subject matter of some of the songs are a little dated & verge on corny at times but that's also something you need to get used. Times have changed. <br /> <br />I was surprised to hear such amazing Beach Boys songs for the first time. Ever. I'm waiting for the day & I know there's an answer both house the thunderous timpani's & powerful `ahead of their time' shuffling snares. The title track Pet sounds is truly bizarre & a little too `Shagadelic' for my liking, but the other instrumental, Let's go away for a while, shows Wilson at his best.  <br /> <br />Overall, not THE best album of all time, in my mind, but definitely an album that needs to be listened to all who love truly great music. It's really, really good. <br />
B000EMGAGW|1.0|Im not surprised that this album is garbage because fiddy has been putting out trash lately (think tony gayo). There are no standout tracks and prodigy doesnt even rhyme anymore. All prodigy does is spit run-on sentences throughout every track and havoc sounds like he's just there to be there. Amerikaz nightmare was a sign that it was over for them. Did we really have to hear this one to see that? If you are a mobb deep fan buy every album before amerikaz nightmre and keep it moving.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done a masterful job of enlightening the reader about the pitfalls of decision making.  Due to weaknesses in our cognitive processes, we are subject to flawed decisions that have a wide range of negative consequences, from missed opportunities to deadly results.<br /><br />The book contains a wealth of information for improving organization decision making.  For example --<br /><br /> - Gladwell's examination of insight is particularly powerful.  Organization leaders are often their own worst enemy.  Their demand for justification for new ideas often kills these ideas before they have a chance to mature.  \\"Insight is not a light bulb that goes off inside our heads.  It is a flickering candle that can easily be snuffed out.\\"  This has strong implications for organizations seeking to nurture new ideas for innovation, especially since creative ideas are typically the result of intuitive insight rather than deductive reasoning.<br /><br /> - Our preconceived notions work against making effective decisions without our slightest awareness.  These biases prevent people from objectively seeing what is actually right before their eyes, even when they are sincerely attempting to be objective.<br /><br /> - Frugality in decision making matters.  Overloading decision makers with information destroys their ability to intuitively pick up the underlying pattern necessary to make effective decisions.<br /><br />Fortunately there are methods to improve the use of deduction and intuition as well as reduce the impact of biases.  Gladwell's engaging writing style brings these points home in colorful stories of real dilemmas for all types of organizations and decision makers.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This album is one of the greatest Dylan-albums and therefore one of the greatest albums of all time. <br />What's so great about it? <br /> <br />1. The music <br /> <br />This is music as it is supposed to be, the melodies are great, great musicians, the music is 'free', it's pure art, not a slave to the mainstream (music created in order to produce 'hits').  <br />If you have a good understanding of music, wich is not only a matter of taste, but also something called quality, you must like this album. If you like art, and I mean real art, you must like this album. What is art? A highly creative work, which transmits emotions and thoughts through various things, like painting, poetry, a song, a book etc. and always has that fine balance between form and content. Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Dylan Thomas, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Chopin, Bach, Monet, Warhole, Bob Dylan <br />Yes, he belongs there. No one can defy that. <br />Dylan's music on this albums simply showes genius musical talent and creativity. <br />And if youre still complaining about his nasal singing voice, please do yourself a favour, go and review Brtiney Spears or something. What are you doing here. It's the same as saying van Gogh's painting abilities were pore because of the way he paints, it's something called Exspressionism. <br /> <br />2. The lyrics. I always enjoy to read the lyrics while listening to the music. Try it, it's great. As far on the lyrics on this album; genius surrealistic poetry. Visit his site, you'll find all the lyrics there. They speak for themselves. <br /> <br />(btw. forgive me if my English is not 100% correct, I'm not English, I'm sure you understand me though)

B0000013GT|5.0|Simply put OutKast has made my favorite music of all time and this is their best cd. This is the definitive OutKast. The basis of the entire album is spacey, smooth, and bassy beats with Dre and Boi rapping over them at a dizzying rate. The beauty of the album is how cohesive it is. This truly is an album you can and should listen to from start to finish. Another special thing about this album is the almost uneasiness you can sense within both rappers. Not in their skills or flows but in their actual state of minds. Dre was in a very transitional point in his life and you can hear him questioning and bringing up fresh ideas that resemble a definite change in him since the last album. This fact makes their music even more special and unique. Every track on here is great maybe with the exception of Decatur Psalm which is really only good whereas everything else is superb. Please pick up this album if you have any interest in hip-hop or are a bandwagon fan of OutKast due to Hey Ya and all that ruckus. (Don't get me wrong Hey Ya is a great song)
B000EHRVP6|1.0|You'd have a better time enduring a root canal than sitting through  \\"Hostel\\" a 90 minute torturefest of decapations, gouged-out eyes and  endless carnage, but without one single witty idea or an ounce of suspense.    Three young backpackers travel to a village in Bavaria in hopes of finding sexual utopia instead they discover of group of faceless sadists , led by a character cleverly nicknamed \\"Edward Saladhands\\" who get their kicks using electric drills, chainsaws and a whole cornacopia of surgical instruments to slice off  heels, fingers, toes and corneas.    Writer-Director Eli Roth (\\"Cabin Fever\\") supposedly based his screenplay on a news story which told of a group of whealthy European Aristocrats who paid top dollar for unsuspecting backpackers to torture and mutilate.    The whole mess is mometarily saved by the manic performance of Rick Hoffman as an American psychotic who can't wait to have a go  at an exspensive pre-paid torture session.    There's not one believable moment in the unplesantness and \\"Hostel\\" seems to have to made for people who get a charge of watching old ladies and French poodles being endlessly abused.
B00005JOQS|3.0|...than he lay down his wife for his friend. When Superman returns he finds that Lois Lane is in a long-term relationship, and that she and her not-quite-husband have a son. The film teases us a bit about the paternity of the child, but the ending makes it probable that Superman at least thinks the boy is his, and the long-term-committed partner of Lois obviously owed him a few favours. I would never have believed it all the same - I just didn't think Superman or Clark Kent went in for that sort of thing at all. Another idol shattered I suppose.<br /><br />When I had a few hours to kill waiting for a flight, the obvious and natural thing to do was surely to go and view a film whose opening sequence is a spectacular episode featuring a plane engulfed in fire in mid-air. My own journey seemed the last word in tame predictability after that. In fact I thought that the 777-ablaze was probably the best thing in the movie. It's not a bad effort in general when one has nothing better to do. Spacey is quality, whatever he does, and the rest of the cast acquit themselves quite creditably too. For some reason they have shaved Spacey's head, making him look rather like Patrick Stewart, Brandon Routh as Superman/Kent has obviously been chosen for his resemblance to our lamented Christopher Reeve, but I'm not sure whether anyone really intended Parker Posey in a hat to look quite as much like Ruby Wax as she contrives to do. Lois herself (Kate Bosworth) doesn't have a lot to do except look ornamental, which of course she does very well, and I suppose that this film is more about how it looks than about any acting it might be said to call for. We are rather spoiled these days when it comes to cinematographic effects. They're certainly good in this film, but I'd say only fair-to-middling compared with some others. I'm sure a bit more effort and imagination could have gone into the Krypton/crystal scenes for instance - I almost felt that this civilisation might have died out from the sheer dullness of their environment rather than from supposedly more catastrophic causes.<br /><br />Now that there is a new Superman who looks the part I imagine we can look forward to more in the series. Whether I myself shall bother watching any of them may depend as much on my journey-schedules as on anything else.the sheer dullness of their environment rather than from supposedly more catastrophic causes.  <br /> <br />Now that there is a new Superman who looks the part I imagine we can look forward to more in the series.

B000002MQ9|5.0|What a blast from the past.  I hadn't heard anything from Dead Can Dance in years so I was ecstatic to find their music here on Amazon.  The music is wonderful, the best way I can describe it is goth meets Middle Eastern.  I was also very happy with how quickly I recieved the product once it was ordered.  Very fast service!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD is awesome.  I went to her concert in New York, and she is just amazing.  The songs are great, and she is a great performer.  I can listen to the cd over and over again.  If you like madonna, then you better get this cd.  Its just amazing.
B00005JOYM|4.0|All though this movie should be a great movie, there is one thing that I already don't like, hence me not giving it 5 stars. <br /> <br />I haven't seen the movie at any special screening.  I just wanted to clear that up first.  But, what bothers me the most abou this movie is that, as it seems from the preview, the NYFD is just a passing bleep, like they weren't even there.  I'm not saying that they need to do a complete 180, and show this from the FD end, making the NYPD a passing speck.  What I think that Oliver Stone should have done with this movie is make it a 2 part, where you profile both parts equally.  Pick up John Travolta as the fire chief, and things of that nature. <br /> <br />I do understand that people forget that 50 or so policemen did die on 9-11-2001.  It was once mentioned in an episode of Rescue Me.  But, with this being the very first movie about this day, both ends need to be covered. <br /> <br />Again, I'm not trying to say that this movie is going to bad.  Far from it.  I'm just saying that all aspects should be included.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If you go into this film thinking that the war in Iraq is wrong, you will come out of it still thinking that it is wrong. If you go into this film thinking that the war is right, you will come out of it still thinking the same. Either way, you will be entertained, unless, of course, you take yourself too seriously.<br /><br />As Spalding Gray once said, \\"Part of being a liberal is questioning your own liberality\\". That is exactly what this film does, and although I do not agree with Matt and Tre's conclusions in this instance, as an adult I am free to hear someone else's viewpoint without feeling that it threatens my own.<br /><br />The fact that Matt and Tre are somewhat conservative in their outlook is, I think, due to their anti-establishment posturing, and in their little corner of the world (the entertainment industry) being liberal is definitely part of the status quo. Either way, if you seriously think a film that involves copulating puppets can sway a person's political views, than you must have a pretty low opinion of people's ability to think for themselves.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|You know what? I'm glad these are coming out, I know what anamorphic is and I could care less that these aren't anamorphic. You know why? Cause I didn't buy a single version of these films past the deluxe \\"letterbox\\" boxed set, as it was first called, VHS tapes, I never even bought the first version of the Special Editions. You know why? because I heard about DVD players coming around soon, then when he wouldn't release the orginals I just decided I was OK with that I'd just wait him out, knowing folks would complain, myself included, untill he did.    And now I can get the new edits and the original films and even if it isn't anamorphic (I have a LCD widescreen tv by the way) I don't care becuase I never wasted all the money so many others and just remained patient.    Thanks George, this set is good enough for me!
B00008YJH5|3.0|Yes, many consider this not only the greatest pixies album, but one of the most influential rock albums of the late 80's, 90's era. However, if you have heard other Pixies albums you notice that there are so many melodic songs, an aspect that this album really lacks. If you just recently began listening to their music, then I advice you to get this album first. I myself decided to save this Album (Their \\"Best Work\\") for last and was very dissapointed. See, this is great Rock music, but if you have heard all their albums you will see that this one stands out as the heaviest, loudest album, an aspect that i was not looking for in Pixies music. <br /> <br />Here Are My Comments For Each Of The Songs: <br /> <br />    Bone Machine- Good rock song, but not a good Pixies song. Sounds like Grunge and I refuse to call the Pixies a grunge band. <br />    Break My Body- Good Chorus, but the rest of the song has a pretty bad rhythm and no melody. <br />    Something Against You- I try to pay no attention to the vocals and I get one of the greatest Pixies songs ever. The guitar is great, it's Pixie-ish. However the distortion in the voice is horrible. <br />    Broken Face- This song is great. It has a good melodic rhythm and a cool speedy chorus that somehow fits in with the Pixies. <br />    Gigantic- What can I say? Great Melody, Great Vocals by the one and only Kim Deal, and great energy. Mix it up and you get one of the greatest Pixies hits.  <br />    River Euphrates- I have mixed thoughts about this song. It starts off with a beautiful chant. But when it gets to the chorus, it turns into a real mess. Frank's voice sounds pretty good here, but Kim sounds horrible and pretty soon it gets really annoying. Then we are back to the beautiful melody. <br />    Where Is My Mind- You all should have heard this song by now. It is the greatest Pixies song on earth. No need for me to say anything. Just listen to it. <br />    Cactus- Again, great rock song. But it doesn't sound likea Pixies song. This might be one of the various Pixies works that Nirvana was \\"influenced\\" by. I call it \\"Audio Theft\\" <br />    Tony's Theme- This song is nothing but noise. No melody whatsoever. If it wasn't for Frank's voice i would never believe it was a Pixies song. <br />    Oh My Golly!- This song supprised me. It's just as loud, fast, and energetic as most of these songs. But the music sounds great. The chorus is vintage. Definitely one of the greatest Pixies songs ever. <br />    Vamos- How many times does a song need to be remade. I liked the original better, and I hardly liked that one. Their spanish is horrible and the song is merely mediocre. However, this is one man's opinion. Many people like this song. <br />    I'm Amazed- The beggining blend of Frank and Kim's voice is great, but the chorus sounds lame. The guitar is still pretty good. <br />    Brick Is Red- I am so glad that this is their outro. The guitar is awesome. The rhythm is melodic and awesome. This song is AWESOME.    <br />    <br />    It's still a very good album. It contains a couple of the greatest hits ever released by the band. Listen to it. If you really love it, i'm not sure you will like the more melodic, slightly softer songs found in their later albums. But if some of your favorite songs are amongst: Gigantic, Where Is My Mind, River Euphrates(Only the melodic part), and Brick Is Red, then I think you would really enjoy their later albums. <br />    You might want to listen to the albums in chronological order (To me that means worst to best): <br />     <br />    Come On Pilgrim- I actually liked this more than Surfer Rosa <br />    Surfer Rosa- Very good but not their best <br />    Doolittle- This is a great album, still maintaining the energy while taking in more melody. <br />    Bossanova- Superior... this album is very underrated. Too bad because people are missing out on music that touches your soul. You get plenty more melodic, chantful tunes. <br />    Trompe Le Monde- This album is beyond comprehension. Their very last and greatest. I can't explain the music in words. Discover on your own the greatest album of that generation of rock. Nothing else even comes close. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E33VWW|2.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman's characterization is the only and lonely reason to see this film.  Art design and some shots are OK, but the music is of the TV drama kind (sorrow represented by lonely piano accords) and the story fall flat right after the beginning.  No character is really affected by the events, and I don't believe when they say they did because they're saying so.  Probably \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a masterpiece, and if this movie is useful in some way is by prompting you to read that book.
0375831002|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is heart-breakingly sad, but at the same time, full of hope. Like many other reviewers, I will read it again. This book deserves to be read by many - it's a powerful tale beautifully told.
B00005JOQS|2.0|***SPOILER WARNING***<br />So unnecessary.  Superman lifts a plane, superman lifts an island, and superman lifts a building's decorative garments.  Superman feels bad because Louis Lane is now married and with a child, which is Superman's son (they're trying to build a series).  There is no growth, no discussion of the problems of the world, no real heroes here.  The devil plan of Lex Luthor is worst than something concocted by \\"Austin Powers\\" Doctor Evil.  Effects are ok, thought, but since good CGI became cheap, that is not enough.
0689865384|4.0|When I first picked up this book, I endured the first thirty pages and then put it down... for a month, but when I picked it up the second time i finished it within a few days.  I think that this goes for a lot of sci-fi novels. [Harry Potter, Ender's Game, etc.] After I got the initial concept and writing style of the author I enjoyed it. Suspense and action made up a good deal of the book, but not in the usual science fiction manner. It was more geared towards teenagers [something appealing to me]. The only downfall of the book was, well, it was geared towards teenagers.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey is a shameless nut-bag whose talent can only be measured by the length of her skirts.  She has a good voice but it is completely over-shadowed by her skankiness.<br /><br />P.S.  This is not good music.
B000000I0K|5.0|This is Mike Oldfield's best album. I've loved it since I had it on LP. Sheba alone knocks me out. One of the pieces borrows from Mozart. The original Tubular bells is a close second. His Best: <br />1. QE2 <br />2. Tubular Bells <br />3. Crises <br />4. Hergest Ridge <br />5. Platinum. <br />A lot of his other stuff is uninteresting. Crisis has 3 great vocal songs by Maggie Riley and Jon Anderson. Hergest Ridge copies Tubular Bells style of long pieces constantly changing.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Last night I watched a free television concert featuring Billy Joe Armstrong, Green Day's brilliant if not frenetic leader and Elvis Costello, one of the original punk rockers from yesteryear in a series of remarkable and glued to the set duets. Elvis exhibited the finesse of a tried and true whiskey throated veteran lounge singer while Billy Joe came to work, period, as he always does equipped with his mercurial energy and his groups message to the legions of fans that fill his stadium concerts.<br /><br />The following songs on American Idiot  in my view hold the piece together and prevent you from any disappointment in the content of the CD- Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Wake Me Up when September Ends and Holiday. Green Day started as a garage band in a Northern California suburb which may just have well been a Chicago suburb or a Miami suburb, kids are all the same. They just want something to do and and they feel the forlorn disillusionment of a generation slapped down by the actions of an older generation that appear to be unprecedented in the history of our country and falls directly on their shoulders with the realization that there will never be another Free Love movement anytime soon just when their hormones are raging with no place to go and every American is in tension mode on a regular basis. I readily perceive these emotions in Green Day's music and I can discern the symbolism of Billy Joe standing up there hitting his guitar like a woodsman annihilating a tree and literally barking the message of detachment that almost every suburban youth feels on a warm Saturday night when they start roaming and getting into trouble. The courts and the psych wards are jammed with these children of the baby boomers who somehow managed to straighten out their lives only to see their kids get swept into a new world of seemingly insurmountable turmoil. Green Day, with their music also confronts the inner turmoil of today's youth and through their own problems is saying that we are affected just as you are so let's shout it out. Green Day albums are good to buy for the quality of their band even if you could care less about their message. There is no question that as a music reviewer of some success, I can unequivocally say that any Green Day product has a buy rating.<br /><br />Jay Adler-  Massapequa, New Yorke affected just as you are so let's shout it out. Green Day albums are good to buy for the quality of their band even if you could care less about their message.

0312857063|4.0|As the first, Terry Goodkind's penmanship flows well in the second.  It was a great read as Richard and Kahlan find themselves mired in ever deepening political and personal `adventures', the story develops numerous twists and turns.  Unlike the first, the story does bog down on occasion as the author lays the ground work of history and develops new sub plots for the series.  All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you like the first, you'll get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the second.
B000002ULO|3.0|Flaming Pie was very well received by fans and critics alike upon it's release, coming on the heels of The Beatles Anthology, Paul was definitely on the upswing. <br /> <br />I can understand why the praise for this album was so fullsome as it contains some textbook McCartney moments. <br /> <br />The first single 'Young Boy' is a nice bouncy pop song recorded in collaboration with Steve Miller. I've never really been a fan of Paul's collaborations with others (except the Elvis Costello one!) and this one really doesn't do much for me either. It's a very strong song but it doesn't really pull up any trees for me musically.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album to me can be spilt into two sections. The very very good and the distinctly average. <br /> <br />The good far outweighs the bad though. <br /> <br />'The Songs We Were Singing' opens the album and is quite an epic production in the 'Tug Of War' mould, building up from a simple acoustic guitar backing to a climactic end with military style drumming. Excellent start. <br /> <br />'The World Tonight' follows this up and is a bit of a rocker that could fit nicely on any Wings album. Again a great song. <br /> <br />There are also an abundance of classic McCartney acoustic numbers in 'Somedays', 'Little Willow', 'Calico Skies' and 'Great Day' - all of which are gorgeous and are up there with some of the best things Paul has written.  <br /> <br />'Heaven On A Sunday' is a very nice laid back ballad with some gorgeous backing vocals. Nice to listen to on a sunny English Summers day with an ice cream I would think! <br /> <br />The title track is a piano based rocker with some fun lyrics similar in feel to 'Fine Line' from the 'Chaos & Creation..' album. <br /> <br />'Souvenir' is another of Paul's gospel tinged ballads. An interesting production with a fantastic vocal performance. This would be nice to see live! <br /> <br />The album really climaxes with the big production number 'Beautiful Night' a melody right outof the top drawer which features all the bells and whistles (Ringo, George Martin score, extended singalong ending). It all works extremely well and really drives the album home ('Great Day' is a nice little way to return to earth and close the album). <br /> <br />Now, everything excellent up to that point. So why just the 3.5 stars?? <br /> <br />I have always kind of had a problem with listening to this album as a whole. To me it is too long. There are songs on here that I feel really let the rest of the album down. 'Really Love You' and 'Used To Be Bad' are basically just jams that ended up on the album. Neither of them are bad but they really should have just been b-sides. They don't really fit the overall mood of the album and to me disrupt the flow. 'If You Wanna' is another mid paced track that I could live without. Nice enough but not of the same quality of the tracks around it. <br /> <br />And as much as I like Jeff Lynne I feel that some of the production here is a bit pedestrian and generic. Some of the songs could lend themselves to more interesting arrangements. It's a minor quibble - the quality of the majority of the tracks more than makes up for this. <br /> <br />So I'm probably in the minority of people that prefer 'Off The Ground' to 'Flaming Pie'. Sure, the songs on FP are generally of better quality than those on OTG, but I feel that OTG hangs together better as an album than FP. <br /> <br />That said though, there are some absolute classic McCartney moments here and it is an essential purchase for the collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a lot of fun. The characters are interesting and well written. The dialogue is witty. The individual episode plots are entertaining within their own borders and also neatly capture tidbits of greater themes that weave through the whole series. Okay, I've hit the writing, check. I've hit on plot. Check. Oh, yes, the acting... what use is great writing if acted poorly? Rest assured the actors, all of them, do great work. You will enjoy visiting the setting of Firefly and its characters. Enjoyment. Entertainment. You've got nothing to lose in betting on this one.
B000000H4V|3.0|I really like this album. Probably the most notable thing here is Sepultura's creative use of rhythms. There is a fine balance between heavy, compelling grooves, and corny \\"brootal breakdowns.\\" The 1993 release date probably helps this a bit. Coming out the same year as Earth Crisis's \\"firestorm\\" and before Hatebreed, this was before the approach of chugging away on open D/C minor chords while drums play the simplest beat possible had been done to death by every metalcore act under the sun. Here the rhythyms are slowed down from typical thrash, but there are still enough interesting elements in the drumming (and other instruments) to keep the album enjoyable and fresh after 10 or 15 plays. The vocals are pretty goofy, but what do you expect, it's metal. Plus it's a Brazilian singing in English. I respect that. Overall, I'd recommend this.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I have no idea if this movie was actually released in any Red State.  Regardless, so long as films such as this, which are unafraid to challenge and illuminate the dangers of creeping religious-based autocracy and dare the viewer to exercise one's intellect, continue to be made and seen by a widestream audience, hope remains.<br /><br />Unfortunately I fear that those who would most benefit from this film's message are probably the least likely to watch it.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|to be truthful Dylan hadn't released anythingh amazing since \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", ans that was almost a decade ago when he released \\"Blood On The Tracks\\". This is a seminal work of subtle beauty and brillient story telling. Each track tells a tale of deep characters being created from the conscience of a depressed and destrought man (Dylan's marriage had collapsed) and this leads to a wondeful album, both depressing and uplifting in equal measure. This is a must buy.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I've watch this movie for many times.. I love it and already put it in my list as the best musical movie ever! The emotion that this movie brought.. everything is fantastic. You have to watch it to feel it. It's absolutely a great great movie.. but don't put it out of it's catagory.. It's a great musical movies..
0375831002|5.0|This book is so well written, it's totally unique and fun to read...and then it will completely expose your soul. My heart breaks to think that this is not just the story of one girl, but really about the lives of so many regular people caught in a horrific time in history. I feel just the same way as the woman here who said she's thinking of people to whom she can send a copy of this book, because it is so special. Markus, you are truly gifted.
B000002LK1|4.0|I discovered Depeche Mode lately and simultaneously realized why so many sad little kids back in the day loved them so. <br /> <br />Setting the spotless synth foundations for other milestone groups like Nine Inch Nails (who broke into the scene only a year earlier) Depeche Mode combines their dreamy sound with deep expounding lyrics and quavering vocals.  <br /> <br />Obvious hits like Personal Jesus will leave you hooked. The beats, lyrics and raging guitars create a song no short of awesome. <br /> <br />My personal favorite is Clean, the final track which I presume is about drugs. <br /> <br />The album fits like a glove but falls short when you question it's consistency. Depeche Mode remains the pinnacle of gothic techno-beat producing mongols that they are surrounded by. With the exception of Nine Inch Nails, which is another discussion.
B00003XB8K|5.0|im a heavy listener of faster material, mainly trance and progressive. Like nice solid beats, and always appreciated a good melody and a background. Never did I think that I would ever actually end up addicted to a chillout or new age album, and here it is, im puttin my Dj Tiesto on hold, puttin all my CDs away, to listen to this beautiful and rich album. I cant go an hour without playing Push The Limits or Traces. Whether you like clubbing, or staying at home, or getting drunk, or whatever, its a sin not to give enigma a chance with this, even if your a fan of faster stuff like drumnbass or trance.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Okay, I know I'm not alone when I say that 'Jaws' scared the crap out of me.  Not so much anymore, cuz I'm used to it, but show this to someone for the first time and they're sure to think twice about taking a swim, that's for sure.  The great thing about this film is the way Speilberg directed it, keeping us glued in suspence, never showing us the shark really until the very end...and don't even get me started with the theme music.  Just hearing that alone makes my skin crawl.  Yes, granted I was very young when I saw 'Jaws' for the first time, and yes this is 'outdated' sort-of-speak compared to todays graphics BUT the graphics are not what made this film.  Sure the shark looks fake, but you ONLY SEE HIM AT THE END OF THE FILM.  Up until that point you see a fin and blood.  Brilliance. <br /> <br />The story is also great because, while it may be unlikly that a Great White of all sharks is gonna end up close to shore feasting on children, having lived in Florida I know that there are many instances when hammerheads and the like travel close to shore and attack.  Fact is that most shark attacks occur in waist high water.  That said the story of a Great White attacking a Long Island local beach is not too far fetched.  The reactions of the town folk, espiecially the mayor, is also pretty accurate.  I mean, what mayor is gonna bypass money?  So what if some people get killed. <br /> <br />The final frames of the film are chilling...and I'm sorry but watching Brody and Hooper (Scheider & Dreyfuss) swim back to land made me anxious.  I couldn't have done it...be in the water after all that.  But that's just me.  All involved give great performances, from shark hunter Quint (Shaw) who offers to take Hooper and Brody out to find the shark...to Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) the entire cast is brilliant.  Like I said, while it may be 'outdated' it's still so superior to any 'shark' film released since...it really does stand alone as one of the scariest and smartest films to date!
0316172324|4.0|This is one of those books you read through with mild pleasure, only to realize at the end that the author's entire point could have been summed up quite well with one simple sentence. In this case, the sentence is: Trust your intuition, because it offers insights that logic can't.<br /><br />That's certainly true. And the anecdotes and research Gladwell uses to support his thesis are entertaining, even if not all of them are as conclusive as he seems to think they are. But basically, this book is an somewhat belabored series of articles connected by the theme \\"Trust your intuition.\\" If you already believe in the power of intuition and trust your ability to sometimes make snap judgements based on gut feelings seemingly without reason or research, then this book will be a fun little read, but you won't really learn anything new. If you believe intuition is a poor tool in decision-making, and you prefer to research everything into the ground and ignore gut feelings, then I doubt this book will convince you otherwise (but who knows?)<br /><br />I bought this book because I'm studying improv, and my teacher recommended it. Improv requires snap decisions made without deliberation, and I was hoping this book would examine the transcendent state of suspension of deliberation that so many improv students have trouble achieving. How do you turn off your logical brain and react wisely without thinking? Sadly, Gladwell can't tell us how; I don't know whether anyone could. However, if you're interested in a more thorough and in-depth study of a closely related topic (how people can turn off the chattering parts of their brain and get into a groove where decisions come easily and without \\"thinking\\"), I very highly recommend Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's \\"Flow,\\" one of the definitive works in the field.<br /><br />Either way, buy \\"Blink\\" if you'd like some light airport reading. Don't expect anything very meaty, and don't expect any revelations.
B00005JOX6|4.0|Adam Sandler does it again.  Sure, his characters are slightly repetitive(every role he seems to have to get revenge on some shmucks for messing with his lifestyle).  But, I cannot deny the comical and dramatic greatness of this film.  It is one of if not the best film of the summer thus far.  I am not Sandler's biggest fan, but a few of his films have made it to the top shelf of my movie cabinet.  And, when this reaches DVD, it will join that number(when the saints go marching in--everyone now...). Full of laughs and tears(surprisingly good tear-jerking moments), Click is definitely worth repeated viewing/visits.   <br /> <br />   Additionally, I would add that Christopher Walken's character is a bit confusing during the film, and I wasn't sure how to rate his performance.  Kate Beckinsale is just absolutely dreamy even with an American accent(even if her role is ordinary or sub-par, she can't do much wrong looking so good&lt;smiles>).  There is one minor character that is a little disturbing/questionable at the Bed, Bath and Beyond store(for those who have seen the movie, you know who I mean).  And, the young \\"bully\\" of the film takes a page from the toy-melting psycho-kid from Toy Story.  Henry W's portrayal of Sandler's dad is touching though still semi-typical.  Perhaps the best line of the film is when Sandler flashes back to his first kiss with Beckinsale.  And, I have to admit I really enjoyed his way of handling his boss played by Mr. Baywatch&lt;grins>.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Once again, following the rule rather than the exception, the sequel does not quite live up to the original. While Matrix Reloaded has exemplary action scenes and state-of-the-art CGI effects, the movie is not as cohesive as the original Matrix.
0743201140|1.0|The code won't work and they are terrible in their customer support to trying to fix this. <br /> <br />Mr. Buckingham- you need a new book jacket design which mentions that code is only usable once. Very very disappointed.
079284131X|4.0|I saw this film when I was 10 years old and I don't remember getting much sleep afterwards.  If you want a decent scare I'd recommend this film for it far outways the films that follow.  This is a genuine thrill ride with state of the art effects and a creepy as hell plot.  A murderer comes back as a doll and starts killing everyone.  Brilliance.  Too bad it could never be repeated, at least not effectivly.
0380713802|2.0|In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to \\"do Europe\\". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack. <br /> <br />In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip. <br /> <br />\\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had. <br /> <br />Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees \\"the sights\\" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications. <br /> <br />This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.  <br /> <br />But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe: <br /> <br />1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result. <br /> <br />2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by. <br /> <br />3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign andsatirize everything that is unfamiliar. <br /> <br />4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices. <br /> <br />This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean: <br /> <br />\\"Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team.\\" (pg 32) <br /> <br />\\"The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there.\\" (pg 91) <br /> <br />\\"In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide.\\" (pg 97) <br /> <br />\\"But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime.\\" (pg 110) <br /> <br />\\"I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people.\\" (pg 123) <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you're someone who \\"did Europe\\" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen <br /> <br />PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul).
B00005JNRY|4.0|I had low expectations for this film.  I think the title is pathetically uninspired and lifeless.  I thought the Cable Guy would be the overly talkative, obnoxious character like Donkey in Shrek.  And, not being a big expert/fan of cars in general, I thought I might be overall underwhelmed. But, my father wanted to see this, so I took him to see it for Father's Day.  And, I had the best day with him in a long time.  Amazingly captivating--with a few details that are culturally overplayed groaners--and well paced, CARS takes a checkered flag in my book.  I have seen probably more computer animated films than I'd like to see in one year. [I was equally surprised by Over The Hedge.  Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.  But, I wouldn't like that to ruin the film for me.  One of the funnier highlights is the use of cars as even the insects of the film.  Oh, and stay through the credits for a satisfying end note.
1401302378|1.0|I was excited when I first got this book.  As I began to read it though I discovered many problems with the conclusions Anderson was making.  For example, he made Google out to be an ingenious search engine, capable of retrieving exactly what people want using \\"Wisdom of the Crowd\\".  And in most cases this \\"Wisdom\\" was given out of a sense of purpose and not for profit.  Reality could not be further from the truth.  I find Google to be increasingly less useful.  Made-For-Adsense websites dominate the top search results of everything which contain nothing more than link farms, useless link directories, and of course Google advertisements made to make Google and the Adsense partner rich at the expense of small business owners on the Long Tail.  In fact there was so much indirect praise for Google I began to wonder if Anderson was somehow making a commission through Adsense.<br /><br />Then there's Wikipedia.  The body of knowledge where whoever is the most persistent wins, including high school and college students with nothing better else to do.  Hardly a crowd wisdom I'm interested in.  Anderson seems to believe crowds are smarter than individuals.  While crowds might be better at predicting crowd behavior they certainly don't solve any significant problems.<br /><br />The references to and quotes from Karl Marx were never ending.<br /><br />I could keep going but I won't.  If you generally lean towards classical economics or you think America is better off not being a true democracy because you don't want the \\"crowd wisdom\\" ruining what's good, then you probably won't like the book.  You probably won't even finish reading it.  I couldn't.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|...Sufjan Stevens is the only artist known to man who has embarked on a project this expansive.  this is his second album in a series of recordings based on each of the fifty states.  the different melodic techniques he uses are accessible to nearly anyone who takes the time to listen.  his songs go from driving, pulsing beats such as the track \\"they are zombies\\" to the beautifully poetic \\"predatory wasps of the palisades.\\"  this album is a change from his previous album on the state of michigan which was mostly carried by a folk influence.  if you have not yet heard of sufjan stevens, it will not belong until you become one of the elite cadre sharing the revelation that you've become a party to.

0767818040|3.0|I just finished watching another Brian De Palma movie, the one with Travolta running all over the place trying to save a girl.  This one is similar in that you have an inept \\"hero\\" running all over the place trying to save a doomed girl and failing, with De Palma stretching it out to squeeze out every bit of \\"eek\\" value he can.  But this one is better, which isn't saying much.<br /><br />The story is actually interesting and has a good twist to it.  What we thought we were seeing turns out not to be what we were seeing.  What we thought the movie was about turns out not to be what the movie is about.  Deception lurks beneath the surface.<br /><br />The one thing I hated about this film is that it made me dizzy.  It resorted to a camera technique of circling.  The camera circles as our two heroes kiss each other.  It made me as dizzy as the old video game where you have to go down halls and kill Nazis, you remember the game.  These spinning scenes make me carsick.  Wolfenstein.  A combination of Adolf the Wolf Hitler and Frankenstein.<br /><br />De Palma returned to that circling technique later in the film when it was necessary to remind the audience of the earlier scene of the two protagonists kissing.  It made me dizzy again.  I had to look away and say Damn you, De Palma, stop making me dizzy.<br /><br />There was one hysterical scene where the hapless and moronic good guy, who should have just called 911, the idiot, tried ineffectually to save the girl from being bored by a drill through the belly.  The stupid idiot good guy ran so far and tried so hard to break into the house of the murder (thank you De Palma for stretching out that bit of nonsense) and then the good guy was attacked by a guard dog.  You'd think the guard dog would protect a woman being murdered, but noooooooo, it doesn't attack the attacker, it attacks the rescuer.  That was pretty funny, if you stop rooting for the good guys and start laughing at what De Palma is putting us all through.  That's what De Palma does.  He is a Johnny One Note.  He puts us through agita and makes it last too long.  He's a hack director, a joke, less creative than soft drink commercials.  He should have directed Perils of Pauline.  Hahaha, I come to collect the rent, do you have the rent, or will you marry me, or shall I throw you on the train tracks and tie you up?h.  That's what De Palma does.  He is a Johnny One Note.

B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life is a true trooper. Surpassing even Ray of Light in its cohesion, Madonna's most infamous album is also her strongest. Forget the highly publicised criticisim it has received - never has Madonna been so bold and entrancing at the same time. Never failing to be innovative, she here takes it to the extremes alongside producer Mirwais Ahmadzai, who also co-produced her 2000 album Music. But Madonna sadly is a victim of her own image, and this album even more so, for it became the worst-received album of Madonna's career. All image and commercialisation aside, though, there is much to like, to say the least, about American Life.<br /><br />We kick off with the infamous title track, \\"American Life\\". While the ever-more infamous video was never aired, replaced by a weaker one (while still appropriate in a way), the song in itself is deceptively profound. Subtly criticising the shallowness of American high society, Madonna instantly shows that she's going no way but hers for this album. Mirwais' hard synth sounds pound on you throughout, apart from those moments when you get lost in the chorus, a surprising guitar strumming, where Madonna states that she's \\"living the American dream\\". The intended in-your-face amb flows throughout, climaxing in the closing rap segment. Undeniably, when the song draws to a close, one is thinking harder.<br /><br />We stroll into \\"Hollywood\\", whose lyrics are as deceptive yet clear as \\"American Life\\"'s. Careful to stay in the background, Madonna asks the listener whether Hollywood really is the great place it's made out to be. All this is accompanied by Mirwais' flawless guitar arpeggios and windlike sounds. Certainly at this point of the album, we learn that it is not all societal confrontation; \\"Hollywood\\" is a beautifully crafted song, both delicate and powerful at the same time.<br /><br />Following is \\"I'm So Stupid\\", and if you think you are about to get a rest from the pointed finger, you've got another thing coming. Madonna openly admits to her having been \\"stupid, `cause I used to live in a fussy dream\\". Furthermore she sings that \\"everybody's looking for something\\". The song, with its cut guitar arpeggios and sounds courtesy of Mirwais, attributes to the statement perfectly.<br /><br />The listener is prompted into \\"Love Profusion\\", and if you had second thoughts for the first three tracks, you certainly won't now. A beautiful acoustic guitar number with perfectly situated keyboard sounds and haunting backing vocals by Mirwais, completed by Madonna's singing of wanting a solution \\"and a love profusion\\", this song is sure to mesmerise you like only Madonna can.<br /><br />\\"Nobody Knows me\\" verges on being paranoid, but we all feel like that, and certainly Madonna must, whose practically every move is put under the magnifying glass. The most computer-orientated track yet, its hard beats accompany Madonna's stand that while it's frustrating to be misunderstood, she doesn't care what the world thinks of her. You can hardly get bolder.<br /><br />But all boldness and stands vanish with the next track, the entrancing \\"Nothing Fails\\", a love song dedicated to her husband Guy Ritchie. There are subtle confrontations found, in the lines \\"I'm not religious, but it makes me want to pray\\" (underlayed by a gospel choir), but this song certainly doesn't fail in ranking as perhaps the most beautiful track American Life has to offer. It is not a coincidence that even the critics have praised it as the standout song from the album; Madonna strikes gold with Guy Sigsworth's old melody, uplifting it to great heights, expressing the power of true love.<br /><br />Next is my personal favourite, \\"Intervention\\". Starting out as a simple guitar-arpeggio stroll, one is not sure what to expect. But then the chorus appears out of nowhere - one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard from Madonna - and sweeps you away with it. Here, Madonna sings of encouragement and courage, assuring the one she sings ofthat she knows that \\"love will change us forever\\". Essentially, how love changes things. Adonned with an appropriately subtle and self-interpretative title, \\"Intervention\\" casts all doubts of the album's integrity into the deepest abyss. This is pure musical perfection, as beautiful as \\"Nothing fails\\", but in its own way.<br /><br />The guitar theme continues, and softens even more, with the entirely strummed \\"X-Static Process\\". This simple melody can be looked at in many ways, but essentially it's an expression of how love can make you forget who you are, as well as how you are just as good as the one you love. It's the simplest song in terms of effects; it's almost entirely strummed on an acoustic guitar, and is co-written by Stuart Price, with whom Madonna would go on to produce her following album Confessions on a Dance Floor.<br /><br />We cut to a more serious tone with \\"Mother and Father\\", where Madonna confronts, with the most direct lyrics on the album, the loss of her mother, and her resulting anger at her father. The guitars vanish and the keyboard sounds are as confrontational as the lyrics. Again we hear Madonna \\"rap\\" rather than sing, as she states, very plainly, how her mother's loss affected her.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the (then) latest James Bond film will immediately recognise \\"Die Another Day\\", a strong, catchy tune with cut symphony segments. A song never failing to inspire hope, Madonna takes the title of the movie and says how there's \\"So much more to know\\", and that it's \\"Not my time to go\\". Certainly it's worthy of the Bond name, but as a stand-alone song, it still is a real killer. Apparently most think so, as it was the most successful single off of American Life, and revered as the best Bond song since Duran Duran's \\"A View to a Kill\\".<br /><br />Things draw to a close with \\"Easy Ride\\". This thoughtful song constitutes almost certainly the lyrics with the most depth and space for self-interpretation that this album has to offer. Madonna sings of how she wants to work for her life - wise words to close the album with, accompanied by clever lyrics of \\"When I touch the ground I come full circle\\". The cut symphony of \\"Die Another Day\\" is still present, but in a totally different sense. The easy-going melody, which the title fits, zooms out what I, after the sound of the violins fades out, feel is Madonna's most underestimated effort.<br /><br />Don't listen to the critics - it may have been met with unjust criticism (largely responsible to her stance with the title song), but American Life, while remaining certainly Madonna's most uncompromising album to date, is also the strongest that she's conjured up. It certainly isn't for everyone, but hey, when has Madonna ever been? She shows here, once again, that there is more to her musical prowess than you can deduce at a glance. She completely goes her own way, to the max. And in that lies her great strength as an artist.<br /><br />Madonna has created another work to be proud of; an album of songs that do it all - confront you, soothe you, sadden you and inspire you. And the pondering lyrics, no matter how simple or complex they are, are the bonus that Music, sad to say, lacked. American Life certainly is much more whole an album, good as Music is. It's even as thoughtful as Ray of light. But American Life definitely cuts the most impressive image. Well done, Madonna.

B000002J03|5.0|I can't write anything anyone doesn't know about this album it's a classic of course. The very first Zeppelin cd I ever got when I was around 15, blew my mind of course. 8 Great tracks, the last one is a stinker but that's ok this is still easily a 5 star album and perhaps their very best.
B000062XFG|4.0|Like the first season, the second round of Star Trek: The Next Generation is short of fantastic. There's still a healthy dose of cheese interspersed with the good stuff, but right from the get-go it's clear that there has been a significant improvement. Also notable about season 2 is the fact that the writers went on strike toward the beginning of the season, causing old scripts for a cancelled 70s Trek show to be unearthed and filmed.  <br /> <br />The greatness here is truly great, however. Season 2 contains the single best episode of the series, The Measure of a Man. This is a bold episode in every sense - it takes on massive ideas (no less than the very meaning of life) and comes out pretty well. It also sparkles with witty writing and a thrilling courtroom scene. All told, this is the best of what Trek does best. The flops are also spectacular, like The Outrageous Okona, an episode about humor that isn't even remotely funny. This is Trek at its most shrill and stuffy, and should be avoided at almost any cost. Also pathetic is Shades of Gray, a clip show. Consider how weak clip shows are even in fluffy sitcoms that have run for years, and you get the idea about how lame this one is. <br /> <br />The characters have developed into good niches, however. Data takes an especially cool arc this season, as he learns that there's more to poker than just the odds. No longer is he the most demonstrative emotionless robot ever made. Riker also evolves from Picard Jr. into TNG's answer to Captain Kirk from the original show. Dr. Crusher is also replaced for this season with Dr. Pulaski, a McCoy type. Worf is no longer an idiotic berserker, but a fully developed and far more interesting character.  <br /> <br />Highlight episodes include Where Silence Has Lease, a brain-bender featuring a great climactic gambit by Picard. The aforementioned The Measure of a Man is also stunning, as mentioned before. Contagion is suspenseful and action-heavy, Time Squared is a good thriller,Q Who introduces the show's most feared villains, and Peak Performance offers an exciting duel of wits between Picard and Riker, punctuated by a real crisis. <br /> <br />All told, Season 2 does everything bigger (but not always better) than Season 1. It is relatively disposable, but some of its best episodes are as good as they come. The next season will truly inaugurate the golden period of The Next Generation. Recommended for completists.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Adam Sandler plays \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe, a retired football player infamous for \\"shaving points\\" off a football game many years ago. He's a drunk these days, and in his drunkeness takes off with his rich girlfriend's car, where he ends up in a mad car chase and a colossal crash. He is sentenced to three years jail, in a prison full of wardens and guards who take a little too much pleasure in punishing the prisoners. The guards have a football team, and since Crewe was once a professional football player, they turn to him for advice. Crewe suggests they play a game against a weaker side and beat them to get their confidence up. The guard's agree and get Crewe to make the weaker team, out of the prisoners! Crewe agrees and convinces his cellmates (who he isn't too popular with) to try out. Will they agree to join the team? If they do, will Crewe force them to lose? <br /> <br />I remember back in high school, there was this really funny guy in our drama class. He was a fan of Adam Sandler, actually. Anyway, whenever we'd do improvisation, everyone would expect him to do something really funny. He'd end up just going through the motions, kind of a little tired and deadpan. It's kind of how Adam Sandler plays \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe. Maybe Mr Sandler's heart wasn't in this film, maybe making all these films are exhausting him, I don't know. His dialogue gives the impression that the character's kind of rebellious, but from Sandler's performance, I didn't exactly know why. Sandler's best acting here is when he has to get himself hyped up, like in the drunken car chase.  <br /> <br />Chris Rock, who plays the friendly cellmate Caretaker, is his usual chirpy self. The inmates are well cast, and are all interesting enough characters. Though they're criminals, they're likeable, and I ended up wanting to see them win. Being a Adam Sandler film, Rob Schneider makes a cameo, as he always does. Oh dear... <br /> <br />I don't know that much about American football, but the football parts of this film were easy enough to follow. The teams strategize, play plays and such, and you don't really need to know what they are, which is good.  <br /> <br />Three and a half stars, but I'll round up to four. Worth a look for Adam Sandler fans. A little different, not his best, but interesting, even if it is a bit silly at times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Recently I rewatched the entire series and capped it off with watching the movie.  I can't say enough about the series and 5 stars doesn't seem like quite enough stars to give...    Firefly was an awesome and sadly very short lived series.  It blended in a very believable way a high-tech sci-fi world with a very distinctive flair for western frontier motifs and style.      But backdrop and special effects aside (the fx are quite good, by the way), the real prize in this short lived series is the way in which Joss Whedon presents and develops his characters.  If you have been a fan of his other projects (Buffy, Angel) then you know what I mean.  If you are not familiar with them, you are in for a treat.  Each character in Firefly is complex and fully realized.  Their interplay and dialogue are wonderfuly crafted and the large cast is deftly handled in this respect.      With the shortness of the series, however each is left with much more to explore.  Yet while this fact greatly frustrates the watcher, in a strange paradoxical twist it makes the characters and series even better because of the history and nuances of each one that are left unrevealed.    I realized that this was a very special and unique series when I could not pick out a clear favorite in either the cast, nor amongst the characters they played.      The Complete Series on DVD offers you treasures in the form of 3 never aired episodes, behind the scenes featurettes, and audio commentary on selected episodes.      An awesome, awesome show that was left hanging in space with so much more potential and so much more to offer to the viewer.
B000002J09|5.0|Not their best, just best selling and with Stairway To Heaven which is their best song no matter what anyone says it's no suprise. People like to pretend they are true hardcore fans of a band if they \\"deny\\" that the band's biggest hit is their best song, it's pitiful but Stairway is Zeppelin's best. Black Dog and Rock and Roll are classics as well. The others are good too.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|As a watermark of arrival, this is a definitive work - regardless of the naysaying by the wannabes and never-weres who choose to revile music that they shouldn't be wasting their time on anyway. (I won't say mean things about what you call music, and you can stay on your side of the playground, and let's just all agree to disagree.) I loved this work from the start - it only took me about half a minute to realize the singer wasn't who I thought he was - and, coming from a musical background, I immediately recognized the craftsmanship and style in the guitar playing. This is a master in his early days, already approaching the top.<br /><br />It takes a skilled hand to deliver the cadences and musicality that are clearly evident here, and for it to be a debut work shows that all the stars must have been in alignment for these guys. There was luck involved; luck has followed Mark Knopfler throughout his career, with getting the right musicians together, making the right executive decisions, and being in the right place at the right time. The band was down to their last bit of cash when they submitted a cut of \\"Sultans of Swing\\" to one of the leading musical kingmakers in London, who liked it and began featuring it on his radio show - and that's what got the ball rolling.<br /><br />I danced to \\"Setting Me Up\\" and \\"Southbound Again\\" every time I heard either one; this album was a staple at the cafe where I worked at the time, and the kitchen was a livelier place because of it. \\"Water of Love\\", a morose, mournful tune that still manages to have a good beat, is the last word on a breakup; \\"In the Gallery\\" was written about the artist father of a friend, and is one of the more interesting songs, lyrically, on the album. Mark Knopfler has said in the past that he's not too keen anymore on \\"Wild West End\\" but it always makes me want to find a bench in that part of London and people-watch for an hour or two.<br /><br />This was the debut for a band that continually defied pigeonholing. Nobody seemed to know exactly how to style them, and MK as their center has continued that tradition; I'm always looking to see what he springs on us next. To have successfully kept a talent like this going for almost 30 years can't be all luck; there is perserverance, determination, and a full understanding of what constitutes good music. This was evident in this, the first Dire Straits effort; you can love it, as I do, or hate it (I don't think he cares if you do), but the work itself should be respected. This is a seminal album that should be in any musician's collection, if for no other reason than to fill that uncategorical niche.ed pigeonholing.

B00005ASHM|5.0|1966 was an annus mirabilis for rock music. The greatest bands of the British Invasion - The Beatles, The Stones, The Kinks - began to reliably deliver sets of all original material instead of dividing their LPs between covers and originals. (The Who's first great album was released in 1967.) Moreover, the LP became more important as a complete artistic statement, resulting in great records (Revolver, Aftermath, Face To Face) rather than simply great singles. While great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year, 1966 was the year in which rock bands began to challenge themselves, and their audience, with more sophisticated songcraft.<br /><br />The Beach Boys' 1966 release Pet Sounds was the best example of an American band making this leap. Inspired by the previous year's Rubber Soul, Beach Boys mastermind Brian Wilson,along with lyricist Tony Asher, was determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the Fab Four commercially and artistically. Many - including Paul McCartney himself, maybe - would argue that Pet Sounds surpassed Rubber Soul's achievements, only to be outdone itself a few months later by Revolver. (I flatter myself to think that people have read my other reviews, but I make it clear time and again that Sgt Pepper was just another Beatles album, so I am going to disregard it here.) Whatever the case my be, Pet Sounds turned out to be a huge critical smash on both sides of the Atlantic. Strangely, it was less of a commercial hit in America not only than it was in Britain, but than its predecessors in the US had been.<br /><br />I will try, even if I have already partially failed, to avoid rehashing everything that has already been said about Pet Sounds, and attempt to review it strictly on its musical merits and how well it has endured over the past 40 years. By these standards, it is factually a great and  truly unique record. One would search in vain for Chuck Berry-style riffs and solos that were a trademark of their previous records. In fact, the closest thing one finds to guitar riffs at all are the plethora of plump, high-pitched bass lines. But not to worry about the trademark vocal harmonies. They are as plentiful and as gorgeous as ever. The singles are clearly the pillars of the album, and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record. But while \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", and \\"Caroline No\\" are all great, \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\\", \\"That's Not Me\\", \\"Here Today\\", and \\"I Know There's An Answer\\" are also exceptionally vital numbers. The remaining songs are not quite as great, but they are good enough to help earn Pet Sounds the reputation that it has. Even the two instrumentals are quite strong, and serve as highlights for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc, including tympanis, horns, tubas, Christmas-y bells, and of course, the Theremin. The overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical, and finds kindred spirits in late-Sixties LPs such as Love's Forever Changes and Odessey and Oracle by The Zombies, and in more recent releases like The Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin. Hence, Pet Sounds was not a traditional rock record at all when released in May 1966. Rather, it was the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop.<br /><br />Influence and endurance are essential to an album's \\"greatness\\". However, it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record's songs are not really all that good. Ultimately, what good is a great record if it doesn't have great songs on it? Pet Sounds needn't worry about lacking any of the necessary elements. But most importantly, it is the songs themselves that would earn this record the high rating that I have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring. In terms of its standing in the Beach Boys catalog, it is obviously their best record, but it is also something equally important: the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys' endless summer. Gone are the surfboards, fast cars, and hamburger stands. That isn't to say that they wouldn't return, but at this time Brian Wilson was dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasures of youth, embodied by Caroline, who said she'd never change, but did. In doing so, he created a record that is artistically influential, historically enduring, and - with nary a weak track - truly Great.ortant: the point at which the sun began to set on these California boys' endless summer.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|This film is very well done, Oscar quality even. However this film managed to make me cry throughout most of the film. It put me in a depression for several days afterward. So, well done film but too emotionally depressing for me. Those of you that don't mind films like this will likely enjoy this tremendously.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I don't feel I need to repeat the various synopses that have been presented here.  The story is basically a day in the life of Dante, who works as a clerk in a Quick Mart.  During the day he is constantly visited by his friend from the video store who likes to insult customers and gets Dante in trouble.  Throw around that, Dante's ex and present girlfriends and Jay and Silent Bob hanging out in front and you have a movie about \\"nothing.\\"  Like Seinfeld, the tv show about nothing, what makes this work are the verbal exchanges between the characters.  For what it cost to make (about $27,000) this movie has a lot more funny and witty scene than most of the high-priced, overblown comedies that Hollywood seems to churn out.   The hockey game on the roof of the store is priceless.   The actor who plays Dante appears to be so talented, that you wonder why he hasn't been in a lot more films after this one.  This is definitely a film you can watch several times, and it leaves you with a lot of quotable lines.  Shouldn't be missed!
B00004Y6NX|4.0|In the manner of the band as a whole and Mark Knopfler in particular, this album evolves a bit from where they were with the first self-titled work and Communique, containing more dancy, more hard-rock types of songs. I had more or less forgotten this one until lately a couple of the songs popular way back when - \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" and \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" - surfaced in my head to nag at me. I'm really glad I dug out the CD - I had forgotten how tuneful most of the songs are. \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" in particular - as evidenced by its longevity on MK's set list even now - is one of the best-crafted songs, in all regards, that he ever penned. The music is sweet, starting as it does with his beautiful National guitar creating its own sound, and the lyrics are beautiful as well, yearning and sad with the inevitability of the story. \\"Skateaway\\" is another favourite; the windows always come down on this one and the volume goes up. \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", written about an amusement park - still, apparently, in business  - near Mark Knopfler's childhood home, brings the whirling colours and sounds of the midway right into the car with me. My only real dislike on the album is \\"Les Boys\\". It does nothing for me and I generally skip over it.<br /><br />I gave this CD 4 stars for something that has nothing to do with the music - the graphics on the CD insert are microscopic. I gave up trying to read them two seconds in.
B000F48CD8|2.0|The music is overproduced, the melodies are boring, and the performances seem uninspired.  None of the songs are great although some of them are ok.<br />It reminds me of a failed version of what XTC did as The Dukes Of The Stratosphere- talking their love of 60's psychedelic music and wearing their influences unabashedly on their sleeve.<br />If you are expecting anything close to the originality or energy of A White Stripes' album this will be a big let down.<br />P.S.- I had no idea that Jack White could do such a dead-on imitation of Robert Plant (a la Immigrant Song) on the title song.
0823023494|5.0|There are few books that tackle the art of character design. This book does so in an informative and fun way.

Well done. From another artist I am highly recomending this book..
B000002ADT|5.0|I spent three hours with Bill Evans--at his motel room north of the Capitol Records Bldg. on Vine St. in Hollywood. This meeting occurred during Bill's second visit to L.A. in the mid-sixties. It was one of those sublime events in my artistic life. During our talk, I asked him about \\"Kind Of Blue\\". I asked, \\"Was the prospect of greatness with regard to this music at all anticipated?, . \\"well, not really; this was just another recording date at the time\\", Bill replied. I assume that none of the musicians, at the outset of the session, realized the staying power or the sublime attainment of artistic expression that would result from this date.<br /><br />Bill Evans' contribution to this recording is much greater than most people realize. His comping and soloing approaches were so different from Miles' other pianists, his uniqueness becomes apparent to the listener right away. The whole sound-scape was laid out by Bill. Just listen to Miles' other recordings prior to this one. The differences in approach are immediately noticable.<br /><br />The contributions of the other musicians were enhanced by the under-pinning of Bill's accompaniement. I personally never heard 'Trane or Cannonball or Miles play more lyrically than on this recording--and I heard these artists, all in live performances, often in  the ensuing years.<br /><br />This is a must-own recording. All the artists are in peak form and respond to the musical challenges with great insight and empathy. This material required new approaches of each player--a more thoughtful expression in performance than these players were used to in the hard bop style. Trane's solo on \\"Blue and Green\\", and Cannonball's--as well as \\"'Trane's solo--on \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" are some of these artists' most lyrically eloquent on record.<br /><br />Buy this CD! It could change your life. The moments of peace and tranquility offered up here will be welcome relief in our turbulent times. Oh...by the way; I asked Bill point-blank if he, indeed, did write BOTH  \\"Blue and Green\\" AND \\"Flamenco Sketches\\". His reply was a quiet, but definitive, \\"Yes\\".nd Green\\" AND \\"Flamenco Sketches\\". His reply was a quiet, but definitive, \\"Yes\\".
B0007MAO0M|5.0|Cowboys. Horses. Gunfights. Thievery. Dance hall girls. Smokey saloons. Showdowns. Corrupt sheriffs. This movie has it all. (Even,in passing, throwing in tepees at a fort, so Indians are represented.)<br /><br />This is a western western, and it shouldn't leave anyone bored. It's as though Lawrance and Mark Kasdan took every western they ever saw growing up, shook them up in a jar, and dumped it out on a coffee table, and randomly grabbed plot bits to string together into a cohesive whole. They populated their film with a cornucopia of the best in character actors; it opens with Scott Glenn, a man made to do a Western, with his craggy looks and gunmetal voice; it adds along with Kevin Kline, dubious, adaptable, unhappy that his \\"whole rig\\" was hijacked by bandits but equally ready to do something about getting his stuff back; Kevin Costner - in about the only role I've ever thought he didn't act like a block of wood - playing Scott Glenn's goofy younger brother with a penchant for getting himself into seemingly inextricable trouble, but who is a whiz with a Colt and an acrobat on a horse; and Danny Glover, a man returning to the family ranch to assist his parents,and who is wrongly set upon by bigots in a saloon - much to their dismay.<br /><br />This is the core group of a cast with so many other excellent additions - most notibly Brian Dennehy, as the corrupt (and formerly bandit) sheriff; Linda Hunt, in an absolutely luminous turn as a saloon manager (I know that sounds like a contradiction in terms; trust me, it's not), Jeff Goldblum, playing, essentially, Jeff Goldblum (his characterizations, regardless of content - here he is a professional gambler - are inimitably his to run with), and John Cleese as a wildly out-of-place sheriff in the little town where all the core protagonists come together.  Everything can, and does, happen on the way to Silverado, and once there, the Snidely Whiplashes of the picture take over, and it's totally the good guys against the bad guys in fine old Western style.<br /><br />There are LOTS of extras in this two-disc set (I've had it almost a year and still haven't worked my way through it all)and the cinematography alone is worth buying it. There is a lovely use of hues here, more than colour; soft browns and grays, almost like old daguerrotype photos; one scene where Kevin Costner's character comes home to his sister's house has always remained with me, a still life etched in my brain; a kerosene lamp turned low, a slice of pie set out for the latecomer, all in sepia and gold.<br /><br />I've loved this movie since I first saw it in the theater and rate it up at the top with all the Westerns I've seen in my life (and I grew up with them so I've seen a LOT). Highly recommended.the bad guys in fine old Western style. <br /> <br />There are LOTS of extras in this two-disc set (I've had it almost a year and still haven't worked my way through it all)and the cinematography alone is worth buying it.

B00005JPE7|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer that one cannot make rash judgements and reviews when the movie is not even close to coming out. I've read excerpts of the plot and I just saw a brief trailer furnished by Real Player. <br /> <br />This movie could end of being closer to the original Rocky than all the other sequels thus it has real possibilities. I for one will go see it. <br /> <br />The premise, as I understand it, the story line has sentimental tones and of course the ususal boxing action. Rocky is now widowed from his beloved Adrian. He is down on his luck and aging. (What guy over forty doesn't know what this feels like).  Balboa just wants to, as he used to call it, ham-and-egg some fights for money and self-respect. A computer simulation is created of a match between the current champion and Rocky, the old champion. Does anyone ever remember the simulation btween Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali? Same thing. In this simulation, Rocky beats the current champ and this sets the rest of the plot in motion. The younger boxer wants to prove it wrong, the promoter wants to make a quick buck and make a circus out of it and Rocky? Well, Rocky has his doubts as well as his self-pride. Thus the fight. <br /> <br />I do not know if he wins or loses or what but, if nothing else, it should be very entertaining. Sly at 60 looks better than most guys in their 30s and I think he knows how to reach an underdog audience. <br /> <br />So, give the guy a break and don't bash the movie before it comes out. I hope this does turn out as a true feel-good story. We can all use one these days.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have to add my 2 cents about this adaptaion.  It's really hard to turn a terrific novel into a film since they are totally different mediums, but this film does a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book.  Excellent casting, great direction and who can be more Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth?? <br /> <br />My favorite thing about this version is that Jane Austen's humor is not really in her dialog; it's in the comments she makes as the 3rd person narrator.  This version takes the best lines from the novel and turns them into dialog (and makes really smart choices about who should say what) so Jane Austen's humor really comes through. <br /> <br />I suppose the new version is a good enough movie on its own, but for a true Jane Austen fan, it's too far removed from the novel.  If you love the novel, then this is the film adaptation for you!

B000F7CMRM|2.0|Too many storylines! The scenes jumped around all the time. The filmmakers didn't blend the the storylines in \\"Syriana\\" very well together, so it left the movie ending hanging out there as to what the meaning of the movie was really suppose to be.  <br /> <br />The only redeeming feature was the acting and the cinematography.
B00005K9LN|5.0|This was the first Judas Priest album I ever got, and along with Black Sabbath's \\"Heaven And Hell\\" (which I also got around the same time, summer '81), these are my two \\"Desert Island Discs\\".  I've owned various permutations of both on vinyl, cassette and CD.    This remaster is, of course, excellent, but curious in a couple of ways.    1. Why change the track order? It was fine as-was.    2. The extra tracks are more of a curiosity than anything else. The live \\"Grinder\\" is excellent, but \\"Red, White and Blue\\" is from the \\"Turbo\\" sessions (in my estimation, Priest's lowest point) and is a typical mid-80's lighters-in-the-air chant-along. Clever (if contrived) title, though, since both the British and U.S. flags are red, white and blue.    However, as to the actual music, this is music that has, and will last, the test of time. At this time the New Wave of British Heavy Metal was happening in the UK, where bands would go to a studio, set up, play live, and put the finished product out as a record (the early Iron Maiden and Saxon efforts were done this way).  Priest did this on \\"British Steel\\" and the results showed the new upstarts that the elder statesmen had as much energy as they did.    Some have said that Priest \\"commercialised\\" on this album. With the exception of \\"Living After Midnight\\", I disagree.  This is as heavy as anything they've done, the Tipton/Downing guitars are well upfront, and Rob Halford (with hair!) sounds as angry as ever. Listen closely, bass fans: Ian Hill is actually AUDIBLE doing the intro to \\"The Rage\\"!    Dave Holland (is he still in prison?) made his debut on this album, and while he is the weakest drummer Priest ever had (not a patch on predecessor Les Binks or successor Scott Travis), he does a credible job here, though his drum sound is a bit \\"boxy\\". Still, though, he'd have to have done his drum tracks on syn-drums to let these excellent songs down...but wait, he did that on \\"Turbo\\".    As stated, this is the first Priest album I ever got, and I would recommend it as the first Priest album to buy (other than one of the many compilations) to a neophyte Priest fan.    They did other good, sometimes excellent, albums after this, but their steel was never this sharp again.
377571622X|3.0|i was excited to see this book, before i actually saw it, and disappointed by how few excellent images the artist has produced over the 20 years the book covers. the black and white aerial creations were fascinating, but the earlier color work seems average when put up against other similar work of the time. the later stuff is also very interesting, but they need the scale of a gallery with huge walls to have the intended effect - in a book they just don't translate.  <br /> <br />i would suggest jeff wall or philip lorca di corcia before this book, and mitch epstein or joel sternfeld for the real choice stuff.
B00007KQKM|5.0|This BBC miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce (here the source material is not just one work but several works of DH Lawrence)than most literary adaptations for English television. Also, while most BBC productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward-thinking characters: in this case the sultry and sophisticated, and somewhat libertine (in a 1920's kind of way), Lady Chatterly & the earthy and irreverent and smoldering (smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class) Oliver Mellors.  Both of these factors can be attributed to director Ken Russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the BBC's best programs (many of them about musical composers). Russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking. Of course most of us in the states know Ken Russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as TOMMY (1975), ALTERED STATES (1979),and, GOTHIC (1986); all of which feature lurid dream sequences and, some would say, gratuitously lewd situations. But Ken Russell is actually a director with many facets, and Russell's interest in DH Lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best DH Lawrence adaptation on film, WOMEN IN LOVE (starring Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed & Alan Bates). He then followed that up twenties years later with THE RAINBOW (starring Amanda Donohoe, and Sammie Davis). Both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though Russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books; his additions, however, were tasteful and even added clarity to the material.<br /><br />What is interesting about this new DH Lawrence adaptation is that Ken Russell seems to have remained interested in DH Lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons. DH Lawrence more than any other author in the English language, or any language for that matter, stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason. This was the main theme of his earlier DH Lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest. But this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that Joely Richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening; the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms.  Its always a big deal when a high profile actress (especially one with the lineage of Joely Richardson) sheds her clothes on screen, but to do so on British televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness. The nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this BBC classic; no question about that. The greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity, however, but, the vision Joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods. One night after hearing her blowhard husband, Lord Clifford  (who cares more for his family estate \\"Wragby\\" and his \\"class\\" than he does about any individual), read from Socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire, she dreams she is riding through a Greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone. This is not something that DH Lawrence ever wrote, this is pure Ken Russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries; plus its the best way to deliver Lady Chatterly's state of mind (or body) to us. DH Lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but Ken Russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those Lawrentian themes with nice visuals. I only wish there were more moments like this. The most sensual acting is done by Joely Richarson when in her private chambers. And Russell seems to be keenly aware that it is Lady Chatterly's imagination that fires her body. After the horse dream Connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to Lord Clifford's first-floor room. This scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow.<br /><br />The actual affair between Lady Chatterly and Oliver Mellors is a little odd; in fact its very awkward. At first they just agree (sort of) to use each other for sex. But of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other, body and mind, and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows; then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be Lady Jane and John Thomas. Their \\"understanding\\" involves a mutual appreciation of nature, and a mutual loathing of Lord Clifford and the upper-class privileges that he defends as birthrights. Russell gets a lot of mileage out of the Racine and Proust reading and piano and chess playing Lord Clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself (pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns; this actor really has fun with this role and Russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many). Lord Clifford is actually a pretty forward-thinking guy, in his own way, as he does give his wife permission to take a lover, but, arguably, its for selfish reasons: he merely wants an heir. We certainly pity this WWI vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions (metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps; what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body) but he just won't allow anyone to actually like him except his live-in nurse who finds him curiously attractive (a plot thread that Russell leaves undeveloped). He even vents about the lower classes \\"knowing their place\\" in the \\"natural\\" scheme of things right in front of his house servants. Russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so (another striking Russell touch). No mistaking whose side this film maker is on. So this affair of the body between Lady Chatterly and Mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy (which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body). In any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons: the one perhaps fueling the other.<br /><br />Lady Chatterly's own father and sister are free-living  bohemians; so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob Lord Clifford Chatterly is a bit of a mystery. Both her father and sister encourage Connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as Lord Clifford. We're not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper Mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for Lady Chatterly herself.<br /><br />The ending is a bit ...well I don't want to give it away. Suffice it to say that it's different than the book and it doesn't quite resolve those class issues that it raised. The answer seems to be: leave England. Perhaps the ending is based on one of Lawrence's short stories. In any event Ken Russell's creative attitude toward the \\"classics\\" is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity started out as a TV show on Fox called Firefly. It was a vision of the future as viewed by the mastermind Joss Whedon. Unfortunately, Fox screwed over yet another quality show and cancelled Firefly. But due to the overwhelming demand of the fans and the cast and crew's love of the show, Firefly was reincarnated on the big screen. <br />Serenity is merely the next episode of Firefly. Though it can be watched as a stand alone film, to fully appreciate it, it must be watched as part of the series. Sure, it's a step up from the TV show, but the acting stays superb throughout. By not using big name Hollywood stars, (not to say that the actors in the film aren't great) Joss Whedon achieves something unique without Hollywood's usual taint. His direction allowed this movie to achieve the great success that it did, though it was not met well by the public. Apparently the ignorant masses want the same old crap and not something fresh. But if you want to set yourselves apart from them, you will buy this movie and Firefly the tv series and you will see what we can do when we step outside the box and think for ourselves.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm a little behind when searching for good music, but when I heard about this new artist, I had to check her out.  I normally do my searches through iTunes, but (at the time) Evanesence wasn't available there.  (NOW they are!!)    So I switched my search to their official web-site to read about them and preview some of their songs.  Which I found to be just what I was looking for..., Deep, Heavy, and most importantly, Musical.    I decided to buy both the Fallen CD and Anywhere But Home DVD from Amazon because of the free shipping and no tax.    When I received the shipment, I immediately opened it up and put it in my stereo to hear the whole CD.  It was AMAZING.  The vocals from this girl is just..., AMAZING.  And, it just goes great with the heavy, nu-metal (musical; not irritating) sound.  Beautiful; what more can I say.    In the \\"live\\" concert DVD Anywhere But Home, her vocals are still amazing.  For a live performance, the vocals and music are still amazing.  Granted, you don't get the same mesmerizing studio quality of her voices (primary and backing tracks) and full music makeup and effects with orchestra and other sounds.  Still.  I don't regret for one second that I bought it.    If you haven't bought any of Evanesence's CD/DVDs, you have to buy these.  You won't regret it.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|After 18 years, The Phantom of the Opera finally hit the screen without either Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman, who originally played the roles of the Phantom and Christine Daae in London and on Broadway.  The new casting of Gerald Butler in the role of the Phantom is visually pleasant - he's young and handsome, except for that nasty bit under the mask - and Butler can carry a tune, but he clearly wasn't chosen on the basis of his vocal powers.  The film gives the Phantom a past - a childhood of abuse, a rescue by the young Madame Giry - that seems sappy and unnecessary, and takes away from the revelation of his despair at the end of the film.  The two-disc edition contains one new song, \\"No One Would Listen,\\" in which the Phantom gets to share his pain to the audience.  The song was wisely cut from the theatrical release.  It's too bad the scenes of the Phantom's childhood stayed.  Rethinking the Phantom as a young man is a good idea, despite it making hash of some of the lyrics, but Butler fails to carry off the role.  His voice is just not good enough.  And Butler is physically graceless at times.  He is wooden in climbing up the staircase in \\"Point of No Return\\" - Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, just seethes with lust on her way up, chest heaving and nostrils flaring - and Butler descends the stairs clumsily when he interrupts the New Year's Eve masquerade party.  It is hard to believe in his powers as a magician, given his awkwardness.    <br />  Emmy Rossum is very good as the new Christine.  She is as sweet and pretty and innocent and wide-eyed and wounded as the role calls for, and she manages to be all these things without making the audience giggle.  Her voice is fine, but it lacks the brilliance of Brightman's.  It is probably too much to ask that the ingenue be everything;  Rossum comes pretty close.     <br />  The secondary roles are extraodinarily well-played.  Patrick Wilson is a dashing Vicomte, and his voice is right on the mark.  Minnie Driver plays a very young Carlotta, and she manages to make the spoiled diva child-like and charming, which she never was in the stage version.  Miranda Richardson reimagines the role of Madame Giry, the ballet mistress, into a warmer, much more fully rounded character. The theater managers Andre and Firmin are well cast.  Their performances are witty, and the actors make their main song \\"Notes. . ./Prima Donna\\" a lot of fun. <br />  The production is gorgeous.  It was going to be tough to top the imaginative production design of Maria Bjornson for the theater, and the film wisely goes in a different direction.  The chandelier does not disappoint.  The Opera Populaire comes to life with a huge cast and spare-no-expense sets.  Director Schumacher is inventive in creating detailed business for the actors while the overture plays, and during the musical numbers.  While \\"Notes\\" starts out lamely - why is the manager singing to the cleaning staff? - it ends hilariously with both managers grovelling in every possible way in \\"Prima Donna.\\"  And the graveyard for \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is eerie in shades of grey and white, dotted about with wonderfully excessive angels and hooded figures, a dream landscape.  The Phantom's lair is still complete with boat, lake and candleabra that rise from the water, all of which are Gothically tasty.  But the journey to the Phantom's lair comes off as clumsy.  The scene in which the Phantom appears in the mirror and snatches Christine away is thrilling onstage, and anti-climactic as filmed.  At times the pair to be out for a very slow, pointless stroll in the corridors under the theater.  And why does Christine need to ride a horse for a hundred feet or so?    Since this is part of the key sequence of the film, the failure here makes a big thud.  It is partly rescued by the boat trip at the end of the journey, and a sensuous \\"Music of the Night\\" coming immediately afterwards.  One note:  I wish the director trusted the audiencemore.  Carlotta is unbelievably bad when she starts singing \\"Think of Me.\\"  No real diva would lose breath control like that.  And just so we don't miss how awful her performance is, two cleaning ladies stuff their ears with cotton when she starts her solo.  We get the point.  Put down the hammer.   <br />  The screen is so full of detail at times that the widescreen version may be hard to see on smaller television screens, like mine.  The full screen version (sold separately)has the usual problems, but if you have a 27\\" screen or smaller, you might want to go with it. <br />  The costumes are a disappointment.  The main characters wear some version of the theatrical costumes most of the time, and they work well enough.  (It's hard to be creative in dressing an ingenue in a black cape and hood, after all.  But Adrian managed to make a much more exciting one for Greta Garbo in Mata Hari.)  The costume failure really shows up during \\"Masquerade,\\" in which the wonderfully colorful and inventive stage costumes have been tamed down to black, white, gold, and silver, and the bizarre beasties have yielded to plain domino masks.  The dance number fails have to the impact of the theater version, too. <br />  The extra material on the second disc is worthwhile.  There is a longish documentary on making the stage version of Phantom;  but as neither Sarah Brightman nor Michael Crawford are interviewed, it seems incomplete.  There are some wonderful snippets of the play in various stages of completion, along with promotional videos and other goodies.  I wish there had been more and longer bits. <br />  I would really like to see a filmed version of the orginal London or Broadway play released on CD.  It appears that one exists.  Until then, for Phantom fans, this will satisfy your cravings. <br />   <br />

The book which explains that the modern education system no longer provides students with what they need to excel financially is enthralling to say the least. The writing technique allows readers to follow the authors life as if watching every major step whereby a new lesson on becoming wealthy is learnt. Whether it be the idea of literally \\"making money\\" aty the age of 9 or understanding the simple yet supposedly complex difference between assets and liabilities, i was compelled to keep reading.

B00005JOYM|3.0|****Contains spoilers****    There is a debt we owe to the heroes (every hero) of 11 September 2001: the least of which is, quite simply, remembrance.    Oliver Stone's new film - previewed last night at the San Francisco Metreon - is a hallmark on this nation's memory for these heroes, even the ones who did not have a chance to assist a single person before the buildings collapsed, but who had the spirit and willingness to risk their lives in the hope of saving others. But once the Towers fall, these men now trapped in the rubble will use their last breaths to keep one another `alive' while hoping for their own rescue. Meanwhile, their families await word of their safety.    So I applaud the making of this film... but, unfortunately, I cannot give it a standing ovation.    IMPRESSIVE and PRAISEWORTHY. A few of the heart-wrenching, blood-boiling scenes of devastation flash upon the screen. The major set details of Ground Zero had me believing that some of the scenes were filmed at the time of the event. It was difficult to watch, as it should be. The sound design - especially that of what I presumed were the bodies falling from the towers and hitting the ground - made me gulp and wince.    And yet it still remained somewhat subdued.    PROBLEMS     I understand that this movie is about the heroes, an attempt to hold on while trapped, but this movie also suffers from having such a limited viewpoint. Perhaps it was out of respect, perhaps sensitivity, perhaps artistic judgement, but there are many volatile scenes abbreviated or excluded from this film. We don't see the initial attack - though it survives by sound and shadows and is then replayed on telly later while the families watch. We see only one person falling from the Tower. Jimeno says in disbelief: How is that suppose to help? (or something similar and perfectly disturbing) But the impression - just like the impression that something may have just slammed into something in the sky a moment ago - is that manypeople are falling or perhaps even leaping from the Tower. The extreme lack of suicides/accidents visualised on-screen diminishes the tremendous devastating effects this would have on the psyche of our heroes, not to mention ourselves.    Why is Mr Stone holding back his punches? Is he making a film that can be shown to kids in elementary schools? Or is he trying to spare us from having to relive the true horrors of that day? If so, then why make this film?     While we are economically introduced to the specific group of men who will later volunteer to follow their sergeant (Port Authorities) into the Tower, while on their way to work that morning, and though many of them are quickly killed, we are introduced to only the families of the two main characters left trapped in the rubble. A wider spectrum of hope and loss would have paid greater tribute to the memory of all the men had we seen the other families notified of their loved ones' `missing' status along with our two main families. It would have increased the dramatic impact as well. Instead, and again economically, we will have three all-too-brief moments to recognise that other families were left hoping for reunions to take place: 1. Jimeno's wife sees a bunch of families sitting in a hospital waiting room (for two seconds - barely enough to register emotion); 2. McLoughlin's wife consoles another mother in tears; and 3. one of the families walks past a bulletin board covered with home-made `HAVE YOU SEEN...' pictures of missing individuals thought lost in the attack. And when Jimeno mentions their names to McLoughlin, trying to remove the burden of guilt for their deaths from him, they were left feeling like extras in the latest Schwarzenneger movie, quickly dispatched and forgotten. And this is certainly something this film has no real intention of doing. But it happens all the same.    At Ground Zero, we see rescue workers being turned away from giving assistance. This was a good scene, but it lacked potency. There simply was not enough confusion here. Had Mr Stone broken away to show authorities discussing the precariousness of beginning a salvage operation, I could have `lived through' what it must have been like to be there, want to help, but not knowing how to attack the problem, making me feel helpless. Without more understanding of the scene, I felt disconnected and simply waited for the Marine to get through.    Ah, Staff Sergeant Karnes and PFC Thomas... Two more heroes. Men with a burden to help others, to fight back. Gawd, I loved these guys. And Staff Sergeant Karnes has one of the best lines: `I'm not going anywhere. YOU are now my mission!' I'm not embarrassed to say that I nearly cry every time I think of that moment.    More rescuers arrive.    Then it's over.    The rescue attempt feels abbreviated, but then so does the whole movie, every aspect of the film feels truncated. The powerful drama of Jimeno and McLaughlin trying to keep each other awake and alive till help can reach them; the family drama of loved ones awaiting word while holding onto to fragile hope; the semi-triumphant drama of rescue (`There were thousands in those buildings. Where are they all?'). I should have been living through a thousand emotions watching this film, but where were they all? It wasn't the visceral experience I had expected. Indeed, many a documentary has left me quivering with awe at our heroes (common every day people thinking of others before [or including] themselves), outraged and angry at being attacked, thoughtful and disturbed about our reaction as a nation, hopeful that there will come a day when Peace will be prized above war.    But there are two minor scenes which reflect the way I was left feeling after watching this film.    After the first plane hits the Tower but before it collapses, we see McLaughlin race past a fireman headed toward this scene of great horror and panic, carrying a hose round his shoulder, casually walking along the street, rather too nonchalantly, I thought. The man was obviously an extra, he's not really even meant to be noticed. But I noticed him, and along with the best scenes in the movie this one will remain, unfortunately. The other scene involved our Staff Sergeant Karnes when he's getting a haircut at his local barber. He's preparing to don his marine uniform and go into action. But it looks like he asked for a light trim around the edges the way his barber is gently trimming his hair with electric razors. But the next time we see him, he's flat-topped like a Marine.     So I came away from this film feeling the lapses in both small and wider details that would have made this an evocative historical document and an emotionally-charged drama; that is to say, a better film. As an intimate portrait of courage and anxiety, or a microcosm of the human spirit both brought to the brink of despair yet to find courage and hope still able to soar, the script falls flat.    It is difficult not to tout patriotism and, regardless of the execution of the finished product, simply hail this or other films regarding the events of 11 September 2001 as effective, praiseworthy and necessary portrayals of that day, but capturing such calamity and resilience MUST be accepted as a herculean task. Many will fail at the attempt to capture it in various art forms. Some will resonate with our memories. And in others, like this film, one will find glimpses of something worthwhile that is being communicated. And I am thankful for the attempt. It is honourable.

B000003CUJ|4.0|Even Wagner had the good sense to construct his monumental \\"Ring\\" Cycle as four distinct operas!  So when Loren Maazel got the idea to record a \\"Ring without Words,\\" what was so important about making it one long movement?  No one knew better than Wagner the emotional impact of a well-placed fermata or a crash-bang finale, but this spark of genius seems to have eluded Maazel in his obsession to keep the musical Rhine flowing from beginning to end non-stop for 67 minutes.  What seems at first to be a really novel idea starts to break down early on when we begin to anticipate the throbbing final pages of \\"Das Rheingold,\\" only to discover that for the sake of seamlessness, the whole dramatic passage is skipped over by an awkward leap from Donner's thunder into the depths of \\"Die Walkure!\\"  Other cuts can be forgiven considering time limitations, although there is still room for ten more minutes of music on the CD.  Edo de Vaart gives us something more on his \\"Ring\\" recording, since he has no fear of finales.  Otherwise, Maazel's handing of the score is quite exciting, and the Vienna Philharmonic is totally responsive to his every gesture.  Here's a good idea for some future recording, one I'd certainly buy and which would appeal to thousands of other \\"Wagnerites\\" like myself: why not a four-movement \\"Ring Without Words\\" across two CDs, with every possible voiceless note from the pen of the Master, one opera after the other?
B00000099Y|5.0|This has been out for a decade, has been in my music collection for that long, and still gets airplay in music collection (though the CD was scratched to oblivion long ago). I don't profess to know about nu-metal, art metal, dark, goth or whatever genre people want to try apply to them. It's just easier not to... they really put together a good bunch of songs on this one, which feel appropriate for a broad spectrum of moods I might be in. Not all of the tracks are for me though, the baby screaming one still gives me shivers and listening to the odd message on the answering machine threatening cancer again feels like a bit of a bad omen to be replaying (I had a family member with cancer which probably doesn't help). Still, even with those two tracks and the funky instrumentals at the back, it's still one of my favourite all time albums. In fact, those odd tracks probably actually make it better by breaking it up a bit. <br /> <br />I'm not quite sure why people would ever give this one star? I guess heavy just attracts people who get overly attached to one band and sledge all others. You're one of the one star reviewers? Well then I bet you've got your own favourite bands who have no faults at all - none, zip, nadda: BULLCRAP!!! We all see our favourite bands through mothers eyes, and if you're not prepared to open yourself to something new what the hell are you doing reviewing music? <br /> <br />At the end of the day, it's just music, and if you like dark music and are prepared to listen to something new, you'll probably like it. If, however you like dark music but aren't yet ready to try out another band, leave it alone, nothing would sway you in your tastes anyway.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok so this record got 4.5 stars or whatever. Its a great album. 5 stars in my book. Every song is great and innovative and sonically enjoyable. SO what if other people have given it 0 stars ? Even if this record had 1 star, id still give it 5 and still LOVE it. <br />So just calm down, YOU enjoy the record, and let other people have an opinion. Even if it stinks :p

B0002EXH54|4.0|Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? (1986.), Megadeth's second studio album<br /><br />From the early-mid 1980's, thrash metal slowly began to gain popularity in the underground music scene. 1986 was the big year for the main thrash metal bands; Metallica released their classic 'Master Of Puppets' and Slayer took the genre to further levels of fury with the release of 'Reign In Blood'. Also in that year, Megadeth truly came of age as a band. Dave Mustaine, since being booted out of Metallica had been out to better his former band and prove he was the real godfather of thrash metal. Megadeth's first album, 'Killing Is My Business...' received decent reviews, gained the band a decent fan following and was overall a pretty cool debut album but it lacked true cohesiveness and that classic touch. Due to this, there was no doubt in many peoples minds that the real genius behind the thrash metal sound was in Metallica and not with Dave Mustaine. However, a year after their 1985 debut, Megadeth released their follow-up in 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying'. Suddenly, here was an album which was praised much more greatly by fans and critics. It was clear now that Dave Mustaine meant business and people had to take him and his band much more seriously. 'Peace Sells...' has gone on to be seen as one of the pivotal records in the development of thrash metal and is looked-up to by many fans to this day. So, had Dave Mustaine and Megadeth really hit the mark with their second release?<br /><br />There's no doubt about it, this is a great album full of excellent songwriting, energy, aggression and a good dose of humour! Megadeth improved leaps and bounds with this album and made metal fans sit up and notice them. Also, Dave Mustaine's rivalry with Metallica was now much more matched (on a personal note, my opinion is that Metallica released stronger material in the 1980's but Megadeth were far superior from the onset of the 90's onwards). 'Peace Sells...' is up there as one of Megadeth's finest releases although admittedly it's not quite got the 5* quality of 'Countdown To Extinction' or 'Rust In Peace', the latter being perhaps the all-time greatest thrash record. Although not as lyrically political and incisive as later release, Dave Mustaine does a much improved job with the lyrics. Songs like `Good Mourning...Black Friday' have some brutal lines, whilst `Wake Up Dead' and `Peace Sells' have a number of amusing lines. Plenty of the riffs throughout are awesome, especially the opening bass riff to `Peace Sells' which is one of the all time famous metal riffs. The soloing on the album is vintage Megadeth, with every song containing loads of them! The soloing on the whole is pretty good on the album although I find Chris Poland's solos a little too bluesy and it doesn't fully go with the classic Megadeth riffs underlying them all of the time. He's a good guitarist but is no Marty Friedman. Overall though, Megadeth's second effort is an awesome album and cemented their place as one of the main underground metal bands of the time. `Peace Sells...But Who's Buying' also saw the band mascot Vic Rattlehead come time life on one of the band's best front covers.<br /><br />Following Megadeth's re-union in 2004 with the release of 'The System Has Failed', Dave Mustaine personally helped remaster the band's back catalogue. With 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying', the remaster is excellent. All of the guitar lines shine through the remaster, the drums are crisp sounding and the bass is ever present. Mustaine's vocals also sound great. The remaster of the album also has demos for 'Wake Up Dead', `The Conjuring', `Peace Sells' and `Good Mourning/Black Friday. A great remaster version to get hold of.<br /><br />The album gets going with opener `Wake Up Dead'. The song starts with an funny opening verse before 2 minutes of instrumental riffing breaks in filled with solos and pounding riffs. The best moment of the song for sure comes after the `Other lover.......Diana' line where the song totally changes rhythm and pace and the song finishes with a screamed `Wake Up Dead...You Die' chorus. `The Conjuring' to follow is a thrash staple and a damn good one too. More high pitched solos over galloping riffs are here in between more vintage Mustaine vocals. The shout of `Obey!' at the end of the song leaves a strong mark. Then next up is the legendary title track. `Peace Sells'  has that legendary opening bass line cleanly executed by Dave Ellefson before the chugging verse breaks in with more memorable lyrics from Mustaine. The stop start choruses are also very effective before the song builds into all out attack with rapid solos and a `Peace Sells...No No No' exit. A fantastic song, as is the next in  the underrated `Devils Island'. Another fast, galloping song which is pure thrash. The song cleverly builds its way to a climax with the chanted `Devils Island!' chorus at the end.<br /><br />After 4 very strong opening tracks, the second half of the album begins with what is for me, the albums best track. `Good Mourning...Black Friday' starts with a slow acoustic feel which slowly builds in intensity before a huge wail from Mustaine leads into the second half of the song which is all out aggression, with more lightning fast riffs falling into place with lots of brutal verses and another chanted exit chorus. However, from this point the last 3 tracks, although not bad don't quite live up to the greatness of the first 5 tracks. `Bad Omen' has another slower, acoustic opening before screeching guitar lines arrive which sound like an evil cackle. However, the problem with the song is that it's slow to fully get going and the fast second half of the song feels a bit jumbled and ironically rushed. `I Ain't Superstitious' a Willy Dixon blues cover is next. This is a good little song, an old time tune with a metal makeover. Poland's solos sound most at home here on this song and the fast exit to the song is really energetic. However, you can't help but think this song sounds a little out of place when placed with the other songs on the album. `My Last Words' is a reasonably good finish to the album. Mustaine's urgent vocals are the highlight of the song and carry it quite well however, the riffing in parts is a little repetitive and the song doesn't quite have the overall finish of the earlier songs on the album.<br /><br />`Peace Sells...But Who's Buying' is Megadeth's first landmark album and it got the band on the map. Dave Mustaine proved with this work he wasn't bullshitting about Megadeth's potential and people had to give him a lot more respect with his songwriting on the album and rightly so. Although the album falls down a little towards the end, there's no denying the intensity and power of the metal on this album, especially in the first 5 songs which some of the band's finest songs. `Peace Sells' is an album for any metal fan, from a time when thrash and speed metal was really gather momentum (as if it didn't have that already!!) and popularity. This is a must buy and is a good place to start with the faster side of Megadeth's great albums.

0767812166|5.0|What can I say? I saw this movie a long time ago in the cinema, then I rented it several times in VHS. I felt a little bit disapointed when I read the DVD version was in full screen format. But these people are talking about a different item, I ordered it anyway and it came in a double sided disk with a full screen version in one side and a wide screen one in the other. This is one of the best movies of all the time. It was done many years ago but I think it's still actual and timeless.
B00004VXT6|5.0|What is this movie about ? Tough one to answer. <br />How about : What kind of movie is this ? Hmmmm <br /> <br />Noir? War? Adaptation? Seduction? Black Comedy? Sci-Fi? Psychological Thriller? Historical Drama? Horror? Vietnam? <br /> <br />Word has it not even the actors ( Cruise , Kidman, etc) knew what Kubrick was doing, and the reviewers seem to flop around in their own analysis. So, what kind of movie is this? Why does everyone seem to be so thoroughly in the dark?  <br /> <br />That's it !!! A CONSPIRACY MOVIE !!!!!! <br /> <br />Forget about that ridiculous keystone-cops style farce called the DaVinci Code, Eyes Wide Shut is simply the best conspiracy movie ever made. <br /> <br />What do Venice - London - New York have in common ? <br /> <br />Check it out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

I cannot figure out WHY Hollywood adds any kind of bad, vulgare language, let alone blasphemy. <br /> <br />This was a BIG let down to me pertaining to the \\"Lord\\" of the Ring trilogy, Peter Jackson.  He really was magnificent in those movies... and gee, they didn't use bad language. <br /> <br />The original B&W King Kong movie is still the best.  It's too bad, too.  At least the special effects were superb in this new one.

This movie is such a great mixture of enormous plot holes, ultraviolence and phenomenally bad Schwarzenegggerjokes, that it is just pure fun to see all actors take things so serious! In the future criminals are being punished live on television during the Running Man game show by sadistic scum (one of Schwarzenegger's quotes during the movie) Of course the big former Austrian is also put on the show as a criminal contester and guess what happens? This truly is a classic! (SARR)      <br />

B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis-Kind Of Blue *****<br /><br />To say that this, Kind Of Blue, by the man, the one and only Miles Davis is the perfect Jazz album is well a complete understatement. Kind Of Blue is THE Jazz album. To be able to put together a album so good could have only been done under the order of the great \\"king of cool\\" Miles. But he didn't do it alone, oh no far too easy for a man of his stature. He called upon such heavy hitters as the amazing John Coltrane to blow some sax, which is always a wise choice as he is the best. But not just Coltrane alone he also called upon \\"Cannonball Julian Adderley. The great Bill Evans on piano. Jimm Cobb and Paul Chambers on drums and bass. Talk about an all star line-up. What these musicians came together to do was create the greatest jazz album of all time, and the coolest jazz album of all time, and that they did.<br /><br />To sit and nit pick the album in it's completeness would be too hard. With a album full of nothing but good tracks you can't find any stand outs or any weak links. The textures of each song and the mood of all the songs bring together one of the best feelings of satisfaction at the end of the record.<br /><br />'Blue In Green' being a personal favorite of my own, a true classic in Mr. Davis' musical cannon. 'All Blues' is a real classic among classics. Here you have everyone in the group especially Miles at the top of their game. The alternate version of 'Flamenco Sketches' is in my opinion superior, but thats not to say that the other is of lesser quality, quite the opposite in-fact it is fantastic. 'Freddie Freeloader' is a nice piano driven song which just an all around good feel. And as the album opens with the upbeat 'So What' which couldn't have opened the album any better then it did, it asures that this album is a sure win for any listener.<br /><br />So to realease my final verdict on this album, well if you can't tell I think it is absolutly amazing. Quite simply the best album in the genra of Jazz. To any one who is even curious I do recomend this to all.nra of Jazz. To any one who is even curious I do recomend this to all.

B00004XONN|5.0|maybe i'm the odd-man out, but this album actually clicked with me quicker and more efficiantly than \\"ok computer\\", possibly because i've spent more time listening to autechre and can than any prog-rock.  after listening to \\"kid a\\" probably hundreds of times, i'm still not bored with it in the least, because it's not an album that relies on immediate hooks or cheap thrills.  it's mellow as hell for one thing; it's charisma is based quite a bit on atmosphere for another, and to be frank, it's not catchy at all.  if you get it, it's beautiful, but it's apparent that not everyone does, and i understand that not everyone will.  this is not an album for everyone.  if anything, i feel that this album was made for me because it feels so personal.  the best i can recommend is to keep an open mind.  don't fight to understand it, because you won't.  don't try.  it's not a difficult album until you make it one.  years later, this album still blows my mind. i don't know how else to describe it.

The reviewer said he reads it every two years or so because it is that riveting.<br /><br />It was a long time since I read it so I bought it and enjoyed it once more.<br /><br />It does get repetitive and boring at times the way detective work and good spy work gets repetitive and boring at times.<br /><br />There is a lot of fantasy in the story. Jackal's weapon could never be as accurate as that, period.<br /><br />But the only flaw I do fault in the novel is that the Jackal was focused on doing his mission AND escaping. He would have never been able to excape the net he was in. Never.<br /><br />But what a great read!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|as a recent convert to the joss whedon world, i probably should've watched the 'firefly' series before jumping into 'serenity.'  i might have a better understanding of the core characters and backstory, but that in no way prevented me from thoroughly enjoying 'serenity.'<br /><br />comparisons to other 'sci-fi' flicks are inevitable.  while i don't normally like to compare films to other films (i think books, movies and films should generally be judged on their own merits, not for what they aren't or what they're similar to), i think in this case the comparisons to star wars are pretty justified.  i think it's safe to say that 'serenity' is a superior film than any of the star wars prequels and here's why: whedon uses actual physical locations when shooting.  where lucas relied on antiseptic, cgi worlds, whedon's worlds are organic and real, and it gives the movie a lot more credibility.  these are 'real' places--not a green screen. the movie absolutely benefits from it.<br /><br />whedon is also great at directing his actors.  i watched 'serenity' a second time with whedon's commentary (he's a joy to listen to, by the way. he's full of self-effacing humor, wit, and warmth), and he talked about how he'd often reshoot scenes dozens of times until he had the take he wanted. i doubt lucas ever did more than one or two takes. the actors, for their part, are great. they're fully-fleshed, multi-dimensional, flawed, and heroic.  nathan fillion's 'mal' is the ideal gang-leader with sometimes questionable morals, but he does what he believes it right, and more often than not he is.  the crew (i don't know all their names yet) are fantastic in his or her own way.  zoe and wash's marriage is sweet, kaylee's crush on simon is sincere, jayne's machismo is stereotypical but believable, and inara, well, she's just hot. you can tell the actors love what they're doing and it makes you pull for them all the more.  the secret weapon of the cast is summer glau's 'river tam.' she's one heckuva an actress.  she's 100% convincing as the troubled prodigy holding a terrible secret.  in her fight scenes she's nothing short of a revelation.  glau's training as a dancer obviously benefits the character.  her scenes with her brother, simon, are devastating.  in the commentary whedon comments on how summer was nervous her dramatic scenes, but she pulled them off so effectively that she had the crew behind the camera in tears by the time she was finished.  i was in tears, too.  she's that good.  she does a beautiful job of balancing the her role as a human weapon and the holder of terrible secrets.  where her performance anything less than it was, 'serenity' would have been a significantly inferior film. (and to learn that the bulk summer's fight scene against the reavers was done essentially done in one take is incredible).<br /><br />finally, whedon's dialogue is almost second-to-none.  he injects a lot of geniune warmth and humor--something totally lost in the star wars prequels. each character, it seems, has a foil--someone to banter with--and whedon fully takes advantage of it.  the banter is great, witty, and just plain fun.  whedon's characters are so fully fleshed that we're able to see their different facets through whedon's dialogue.<br /><br />in all, 'serenity' is a great film, one i wish i had seen on the big screen. it really *is* a sci-fi western.  and it's great. i'm off to netflix to rent the 'firefly' series.  it's too bad 'firefly' didn't have a longer life.  i don't think 'serenity' faired to well at the box office, either.  i don't think anymore sequels are likely, but it'd be nice to see one some day.  thanks, joss & co.<br /><br />(it makes me sad to wonder what star wars would've been like in whedon's hands...but that's not meant to take anything away from 'serenity')ss.  she's 100% convincing as the troubled prodigy holding a terrible secret.  in her fight scenes she's nothing short of a revelation.  glau's training as a dancer obviously benefits the character.  her scenes with her brother, simon, are devastating.  in the commentary whedon comments on how summer was nervous her dramatic scenes, but she pulled them off so effectively that she had the crew behind the camera in tears by the time she was finished.  i was in tears, too.  she's that good.  she does a beautiful job of balancing the her role as a human weapon and the holder of terrible secrets.  where her performance anything less than it was, 'serenity' would have been a significantly inferior film.

6305232660|4.0|After a number of viewings I have decided to share my thoughts on this one.  Deep Impact was not reviewed very favorably when it came out but I think most of that the reviewers missed something. <br /> <br />A comet is discovered that is on a collision course with Earth.  That the government is aware of it and keeping that the public unaware while it spends big money on countermeasures.  A reporter accidentally stumbles onto that the story and pushes up that the date for public awareness.  A complex capable of housing one million people has been built underground.  A joint US/Russia project is building a rocket to travel to that the comet, plant nuclear warheads and blow that the comet to bits.  A back-up plan calls for a massive titan missile strike to change that the comet's path. <br /> <br />That the nukes are buried one-hundred yards into that the surface of that the seven-mile comet (a bit shallow if you ask me) and only result in blowing a piece off making two comets out of one.  Both will impact Earth.  That the Titan missile strike also fails.  All that is left is for those selected to make it into that the bunkers before that the impact. <br /> <br />That the first, and smaller, piece hits in that the Atlantic creating a tidal wave that reaches that the Ohio Valley.  But that the second piece does not hit.  That the surviving astronauts locate a vent deep enough that blowing their remaining nukes should destroy that the comet.  Their plan works and that the Earth is not completely destroyed. <br /> <br />Sounds like it could make a good action film but it doesn't.  That the comet is really secondary to that the plot.  That the real plot is imminent destruction and how people handle it.  Several families are highlighted and even a broken family makes peace to face that the end together.  In this respect that the movie excelled.  I have watched a lot of disaster films and seen plenty of people die in them but this one was different.  I am not ashamed to saythat I had tears in my eyes for much of that the ending.  That is that the true deep impact of this movie. <br /> <br />On another level you can see some excellent performances.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job playing that the President.  While he does not inspire me to go out and vote for him (as was that the case in Independence Day) I would like our leaders to show as level a head as he did.  Tea Leoni was pretty much what you would expect from her television show.  But that the best performance came from Robert Duval (no surprise there) as an aging astronaut and that the last man to walk on that the moon.  How he handled that the young hotshots and took command was one of that the finer bits of acting I have seen in a long time.  That the scenes where that the astronauts get one last chance to see their families before they make that the ultimate sacrifice was one of that the most touching and emotional I have ever seen.  So see Deep Impact but not for that the comet.

6305127638|2.0|I finally managed to see Star Trek: First Contact.  One of the first impressions I had was that Jonathan Frakes did not know how to describe the plot of a movie he is directing.  Most of what I heard him say in an interview just before the opening turned out to be false of nonexistent. <br /> <br />This film does not suffer the fate of the odd numbered movies but was not as good as the even numbered movies.  Personally I would give it about two and a half stars. <br /> <br />The movie concerns the Borg but ignores much of their history.  If the movie is to be believed, Picard has not encountered the Borg for six years (when he became Locutus of Borg).  No mention was made of the Borg's earlier assault on the Federation (under the direction of Lor).  Instead it was as if that season finale cliffhanger never happened.  So the movie did not fit well with the series.  But how did it hold up on its own? <br /> <br />I felt it was a bit too campy.  The future was changed as hundreds of people in one of the most important places on Earth were killed by the Borg.  So first contact might still have been made but history was still changed.  Most of the good scenes and best acting were included in the trailer.  After the high-energy opening battle (almost completely shown in the trailer and commercials) things settle down to a dull pace. <br /> <br />The Borg are assimilating the Enterprise and its crew but still ignore the bridge crew when they walk amongst them.  With the Enterprise under partial Borg control the away team is unconcerned that they have lost contact which effectively strands them in history.  Some extra scenes were added to try and give us a glimpse of the main crew (as they no longer appear weekly) even though they were not necessary to the overall plot.  The historic flight that leads to first contact had William Riker and Jordy LaForge as bridge crew thus changing history even more.  Technically first contact was third contact as Lily had met a Klingon andthe Borg.  DS9 history still has not made an allowance for Worf or the Defiant to be near Earth.  The Defiant, the most sophisticated war ship in the fleet, used none of its technical advantages.  Of course how the Defiant exists in defiance of the treaty with the Romulans has never been really explained either. <br /> <br />Okay, so the movie makes less sense that many of the episodes and it may not be worth paying full price to see or to own, but it was fun, if for no other reason than to see some of our favorite characters back in action.
B00025ETIW|5.0|i know a lot of guys don't like my chemical romance and other emo bands well those guys are probably the stupid cavemen types who watch football and go hunting for a young gamer/tv watcher/music listener like myself my chemical romance is a great band their songs rock who cares what the singer sounds like not every guy has a low voice so i like to hear some guys sing high once in a while if you still aren't convinced mcr is good go check out their videos for helena and ghost of you those videos are the best new music videos out there
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I never saw any of the animated series, so I can't compare it to that.  But as a straight up sci-fi action romp, it's okay.  The movie had some pretty nifty gadgetry and a fairly decent story, which was a nice surprise.  Charlize wears the role of the action heroine well.<br /><br />Overall, it's an okay film to rent.  If you're a Charlize Theron fan but not a sci-fi fan, skip this one.  If you like sci-fi, I'd reccomend renting before buying.  IMHO, it's not a movie that would bear repeated viewing.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Don't think this is a masterpiece of ecological, political or cultural thinking. Certainly not but it is a good entertainment, even if the editing could have been slightly more dynamic at times. They have dared ressuscitate him, like the simple comic strip character he used to be. They suddenly remembered that he would not be the first one. Sherlock Holmes was ressuscitated by Conan Doyle. Aliens were ressuscitated for a fourth episode. Even Harry Potter will be ressuscitated in a few years by Ms Rowling after she has has him killed in billions of various sufferings and ordeals. They also say that Jesus started in a way the literary trick for the second episode of the Bible, the New Testament, which became a real bestseller since then. What's more, they're even preparing the next episode by grooming the next generation. Yes, indeed, Superman had left a child, a son, behind him when he left last time he was around. And the son promises : he kills a gangster by knocking him down with a grand, a very grand piano. The bad man, Luthor, is back too, just out of prison, not the man in black like with Stephen King, but a man in white to cultivate differences in a way. And he even finishes his carrier the same way as in `The Stand', though in this case there is no savage he can start preaching and manipulating on this desert island. It is really funny at times, and very emotional when our Superman manages to save a whole family in one single flight. Of course you may wonder if the world really needs a saviour, a new Jesus. Even if you are a Christian Born Again you may have doubts about it, especially if you see the mess some of them Christians Born Again create as soon as they open their mouths. Note the only emergency number they do not dial in this film is 911. We understand why since they try to destroy the whole city in one single attack. That would have been a little bit too simple. A good summer film for this hot season when we can go around without any shirt nor any pants on, at times even without any shoes. Superman will keep you cool even if his human girlfriend had forgotten the heat of his body. You're not obliged to come too close.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonnepants on, at times even without any shoes.

B00004WKII|5.0|I bought this box set not knowing what I was going to experience. I've been a Hendrix fan since my early teens and now that I'm nearly twenty my musical tastes are changing. Starting to turn my back on all the new age rock and going back to the classics. You get your moneys worth with this set. Pop in the four discs and get ready to go on a inner stellar ride. You get four hours of music to enjoy. THe live songs are my favs. Most of them I've never heard along with the demo's. If your into blues Jimi more than takes care of you blues fans with \\"Hear my Train a Comin,Red House and a few more I believe. He plays the blues just as good as that good old rock and roll. The box set has a 80 full color page book that is ontop of the CD cases. The read on this thing is intresting. I would say it is similar to the one that accompanies the Doors '97 box set. If your a hard core fan and don't own this you'll be glad when you purchase this. Newbies get the greatist hits and see what you think. This box was also released in VINYL for those of you with those good old record players.
0743424425|4.0|What makes a book scary? Is it a story of demons, or ghosts, or a few murders? Or is it the inexplicable madness that could taunt the mind of a reader long after the story is over and the book is closed and returned to the book shelf? The Shining is one such story. It's the account of a family, their battles with their own demons in a hotel that somehow feeds on their fears and emotions.<br /><br />Often, the case is made that a book is scary because it unexpectedly freaked a reader with a sudden twist, a ghostly encounter, or a creepy voice. In `The Shining' there is something different. There is suspense, ever so slowly building, until the trickle becomes a river that pulls one toward a vortex of twisting horrors, of something evil that has been molded and cooked and stored until the one to be fed stumbles on it unexpectedly and then its so horrifying that he is left stunned, numbed, petrified.<br /><br />King is a king in the world of literary terror. He is a king of his own domain, of the masterful horror story, of a universe where hedge animals stalk, hotels share emotions and people communicate via their minds. Oh, and `The Shining' can not be told via a word of mouth, or seen as an interpretation by Kubric or any other director for that matter. `The Shining' must be experienced only through the words, because only words can make alive that which is too dreadful to share, or show. For all fans of the horror genre believe me when I say:`The Shining' makes one heck of a memorable experience.<br /><br />-by Simon Cleveland
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Now I know you may I'm crazy for saying that but it's my personal opinion. Blade is good but Trinity although good it left me very disapointed. This Unrated 2-Disc extended cut will not disapoint you and that is a fact. The story line feels a bit more detailed and you get to know Micheal Corvin a litte better as well. This is worth $20 bucks. I read one reviewer her spend $33 for this movie well all I have to say is dude you got robbed. This movie I got it two weeks after it came out and it was on sale for $14.99 at best buy so you should have held out a little longer. But as long as you get this movie your still smart and have good taste.
B00005JM20|3.0|Ok, so Rowan Atkinson doesn't literally play James Bond in this silly send-up of espionage thrillers, but he is still the funniest secret agent since Woody played Bond (Jimmy Bond) in Casino Royale. He combines unjustified self-assurance with his usual fumbling antics to good effect, and his sidekick Bough (played in a delightfully understated way by Ben Miller) repeatedly saves the day in \\"Wallace and Gromit\\" fashion. Malkovich's portrayal of stereotypically French billionaire and supervillian Pascal Sauvage is very funny, and the gorgeous heroine, \\"Exotic Woman,\\" is played beautifully (pun intended) by Tasha de Vasconcelos.<br /><br />I could tell you more about the film. But then I'd have to kill you.
B000024D4R|5.0|In many respects, Pink Floyd's Animals is their most underrated album, and possibly one of the most underrated rock albums of all time. There is some brilliant stuff here, and while their albums like The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall (my personal least favorite) get all the attention, this one simply blows me away every time I listen.<br /><br />This is definitely Roger Water's album vocally, and his distinctive voice is found throughout, but David Gilmour's amazing guitar is what really blows me away. If you buy the CD for any reason, this would be it. The guitar beautifully winds around dreamy synths and Water's harsh voice singing meaningful lyrics expressing the band's thoughts on society (based on Orwell's Animal Farm), with the occasional animal noise thrown in.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Pigs on the Wing, Pt. 1\\" a nice acoustic intro to the album, and is followed by \\"Dogs\\". Starting out with a bang, this song is brilliantly put together as it slows down to guitar solos, synth noises, and some of the classic piercing, intense vocals of Waters, however, Gilmour's guitar plays a major part and works wonderfully. His mastery of the instrument is clearly exhibited here, and this makes it one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />The middle song here is \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\". A beautiful synth solo by Richard Wright starts us off here and then we are led to guitars, along with Water's spiteful singing, with the lyrics \\"Ha ha, charade you are\\" being a recurring phrase. The next song, \\"Sheep\\" is great as well. Wright gets a chance to shine in the beginning, and then Waters just takes off with the closest you'll get to hard rock from Floyd. The highlight here though is an eerie effect here as Floyd tells us a tale through music: a climax of guitar and suddenly silence, representing the slaughtering of the sheep by the dogs (makes me wonder if \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" got the idea from this song...)<br /><br />We finish here with \\"Pigs on the Wing, Pt. 2\\", a song in the vein of the track that led us off here, a fitting end to a spectacular album.<br /><br />Now, I know this album won't be for everyone, but for music lovers and most definitely fans of Pink Floyd, this CD is tops. It is a masterpiece; a journey into the minds of musical geniuses.he vein of the track that led us off here, a fitting end to a spectacular album.

B0002Y4T92|5.0|As a blues guitar player I cannot get enough of this DVD.  The greatest lineup and song lists are to many to list.  If you are into guitars and all the top players on the circuit today, buy this!  The weakest moment was ZZ Top who closed the show, this once great band is basically a tired act that should should be playing Vegas and Reno.
B000055ZB8|3.0|Mildly Disappointed    Nosferatu - Special Edition: Although the added color tints and new musical and organ scores might lure the newer movie connoisseurs and critics, the purist will be sadly disappointed that the original unmodified release and score is not available on this disc. Another disappointing fact is that not once is the original release year mentioned on the cover/insert - something I consider a must. While I welcome remake technology and enjoy it's new dimension, without a baseline knowledge of the original context, it's like trying to understand Shakespeare by only reading the Cliffs Notes.    What saves this release is the excellent commentary track, the `then and now' comparisons which beautifully highlight poignant scenes to how they look and exist today (example: opening scene of Wismar city center in 1922 and present day), and the still gallery which provides even more material for the movie and history buff.
B00006878K|4.0|A great introduction to Albert King, this is a collection of Stax hits for release on the radio, so all the tracks are short, not much stretching out!  I am a blues guitar player who is having a ball learning these songs.  This great bluesman had a unique style that influenced Clapton and SRV.  I didn't care for tracks #'s 7, 10, 11.  I highly recommend this CD!
B00000AFWW|4.0|Hole's final album, Celebrity Skin, is a great album of melodic alternative rock. Courtney Love's raspy voice is in fine form throughout and she proves quite the wordsmith with her strong lyrics. The first half of the album is nearly flawless as the title track mixes wicked riffs with melody very well. \\"Awful\\" is a catchy pop-rocker while \\"Hit So Hard\\" is very dreamy and melodic. \\"Malibu\\", which would be the biggest single off the album, is also very good with its minor chords ala REM and Love's more restrained vocals. Despite its simple riff, \\"Dying\\" is very gripping. Although she was married to the late Kurt Cobain, who also wrote a lot of great tunes in the `90s, only on \\"Reason to Be Beautiful\\" and \\"Playing Your Song\\" do you hear any influence to Nirvana. Other great tracks include \\"Heaven Tonight\\", which recalls Cheap Trick who ironically had an album with the same title, the folky and dramatic \\"Northern Sky\\", and the pop/rock of \\"Boys on the Radio.\\" The remaining tracks, \\"Use Once & Destroy\\" and \\"Petals\\", are also very good. All told, Hole truly ended their career on a high note with Celebrity Skin as it's one of the better albums to emerge from the grunge era of the early to mid 1990's
0790729369|5.0|This is why I love this film.  It's mature, intelligent, thoughtful, real, and in the end, sad and heartbreaking, but not despairing.  Some have expressed surprise that Eastwood directed this film so well, but I'm not.  Eastwood is a great handler of actors and has always displayed great sensitivity to them.  He never makes an actor read for a role, and he never says \\"action\\", because it makes actors nervous.  Despite a little too much sentimentality at the end, this film holds up very well, and is entirely believable.  Streep and Eastwood give phenomenal performances here, and you really believe that they are 2 souls that need each other.  The line \\"certainty like this comes along once in a lifetime\\" really haunts the film.  Rarely do you fall in love at first sight.  You may become infatuated at first sight, but love is a much deeper feeling.  Even though Streep and Eastwood's characters know each other for only 4 days, the rapport they have here is geniune and very honest.  It's a story for adults, and considering it was made in 1995 (when idiotic teen comedies were everywhere polluting the multiplexes), it's even more of a treasure.  Hollywood should do more adult romances, and not silly, vapid \\"chick flicks\\".  I don't like chick flicks, I prefer my romances to be more grounded in reality and intelligence, and this film is one of them....
B000002MIY|3.0|Kamikiriad almost turned me away when I opened the CD case and read the \\"plot\\" of the CD, about a guy who recieves some \\"super car\\" for his birthday. A little hokey, so disregard it and just listen to the songs. The first song is a good introduction, and kind of sets the leisurly jazzy tone for the album. But there are a few suprises like the upbeat \\"Florida Room\\" , and the oh so clever \\"Tommorows Girls\\". <br />  The real prize of the album though, is the 7 minute \\"On The Dunes\\", which has your attention at first note and keeps it all the way through its nostalgic musings of things gone.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Up to this point, this is probably Floyd's best greatest hits compilation, and it does contain some pretty good tracks, but I think it leaves off too many crucial tracks to be considered the best Pink Floyd greatest hits compilation.  Most of the important tracks from the Syd Barrett era are all pretty much included, though I'd have liked to see tracks like Lucifer Sam and Interstellar Overdrive included as well.  One important track that should have been included is Roger Waters' first composition for the band, Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk.  Seeing as he'd go on to the writer for the band throughout it's prime, I think it would have been a neat glimpse into his first material for the band.  Moving on, I also think that \\"Free Four,\\" Floyd's first song to receive significant airplay in the US should have been included.  While it may not be a huge track today, it did bring them to the spotlight in the US, and is just as crucial as any other.  Some other complaints of mine stem from the tracks they included from DSOTM.  Time and Money are both included, but where's Brain Damage / Eclipse?  One of the first Floyd songs I remember hearing from a young age, and possibly the one that got me into them is not included, but tracks like Great Gig in the Sky and Us and Them, while great tracks, aren't quite as important to a compilation like this, when Brain Damage / Eclipse should have been included instead.  From Animals, we have \\"Sheep,\\" which is my personal least favorite on the album, and not a track I ever remember hearing before I got into Floyd.  Why not \\"Dogs,\\" or \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" instead? Much better tracks.  And where's \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" from the Wall?  What about \\"Not Now John\\" from The Final Cut? <br /> <br />Like I said, while a fairly good compilation, I think it misses a lot of crucial tracks to Floyd's history.  Sure, it's still Floyd, and all Floyd is going to be awesome anyway, but if you're going to make it reflect over Floyd's 40 year history, then better make sure all you have all their best.
B000E5N62U|4.0|This album opens strong with \\"Morph The Cat\\"s incredibly pleasing vocal harmony, performed by Fagen himself, but you'll instantly become apethetic to the individual songs themes. However excitment from having another productin from your favorite artist, will make you spend more time with the album-and it will be well worth it. \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\" is a deep and unsettling song, disguised by slightly a upbeat tempo and very listenable vocals, now my favorite on the album. This song is quite infectious. \\"May Shut The Garden Door\\" will leave you wondering what the song is really about, but understanding that its serious anyway. Its a little haunting, but a great song, nonetheless. If you like Fagen even a little youll grow into this album.

B000BKVQTS|2.0|<br />The other reviews of this strange film cover it well, but I can't resist adding a few words. I bought this second-hand out of curiosity, but, having seen it, my curiosity is greater than ever.I can't figure out why it was made at all. It is a confusing mess. <br /> <br />It is (in parts) too violent for a children's film (severed heads, a kitten chopped up); it is too silly for an adult film (and I say that having greatly enjoyed Shrek); its special effects are very ho-hum compared to what else is available. The Brothers Grimm aren't a very intriguing duo; the French general is ridiculous (but of course those Brits do like to make fun of the French). <br /> <br />The film is set in 1811, but the plot--witches, enchanted forests--seems very out of place for the height of the post-Enlightenment. Why not a medieval society? What is added by having the film take place in French-occupied Westphalia? <br /> <br />I really cannot recommend this film to anybody. Director Terry Gilliam--whom I revere as a former Python--should apparently stay on the other side of the camera.  <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|What is their to say about this record that has not been said all ready.   I'll tell what it means to me.   The first or second time i ever herd it, was like 4 years ago, and it blew my mind.   I was done with west coast rap for a while after that[no disrespect to the west].  Forget that, Nas is a lyricl giant among many men and his debut and many of his other albums prove it.   The album starts with N.Y state of mind, which is just that.   I know the first time i herd a young Nasir Jones say i never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of deth, i was in for something special. never have i herd a mc like this ever[i discoverd rakim shortly after].   Illmatic whent down so smoth too.   He's like a AK with a silencer.   The stores he told reflected where that 20 year old boy was coming from. Songs such as lifes a bitch, the uplifting The World Is yours are all classics.   When it came to the lyrical tip nas was and still is amazing when he said im sneaking' an uzi on the island in my army jacket lining, off of It Aint Hard To Tell that was brillant.   The album had very little room for mistakes, which i liked about it. It was short and sweet.   Whit Premo,Large Proefessor,Peat Rock,Q-tip, and L.E.S at ther grimy'st what more could you expect, but one of the best east coast albums of all time.   You also had the show stealing AZ on the 3erd track when he starts to spit hot fire man, the only cameo in this creptic love letter to the N.Y.C.   By all means this is not for the weak at heart[fake hip-hopers].  He was keeping it real on this one, it aint't hard to tell. <br /> <br /> <br />KEY TRACKS <br />-Lifes A Bitch feat.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|I don't care how you come to own this cd but you MUST own it!  Nothing on this is throw away. The best album I have heard in years.  Has not left my cd player for months.
B00005YW4H|3.0|After avoiding the hype for a long while, I finally purchased this album upon seeing my favorite new artist compared to Norah Jones.  While the songs are performed with precision and polished to perfection, they lack emotional involvement.  Why should I be interested in Norah's songs when she doesn't even seem to be interested herself?  In the future, I envision this being the sort of music that will be created by Artificial Intelligence...
B000002J0B|5.0|No bad songs here. Now when do you see that now-a-days?<br /><br />1. The Song Remains The Same..........9.5 - starts out with a guitar, then switched between slow blues and hard rock<br /><br />2. The Rain Song..............8.2 - slow tempo, a nice song<br /><br />3. Over The Hills And Far Away..............9.8 - just so cool<br /><br />4. The Crunge.............8 - kinda weird, almost funk-ish<br /><br />5. Dancing Days...............8.5 - bluesy rocker<br /><br />6. D'yer Mak'er.............9.3 - 100% reggae, now when do you see hard rock and blues and reggae all on the same album and all are classics? No where but on a Zeppelin album.<br /><br />7. No Quarter............8.7 - of course, it's a blues song with a cool riff.<br /><br />8. The Ocean............9.4 - a classic riff song
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Ok I could make this really lengthy and go on and on about vocals and chord transitions, Pearl Jam's long and diverse history, and the fact that I thought this band was basically retired. <br /> <br />But instead I'll make this short but sweet.  New Tool?  Eh, ok.  New RHCP?  Better.    <br /> <br />New Pearl Jam?  HELL YES.  This is the best release since VS, go ahead and argue with me, I don't care.  This is a must have, my favorite CD in the past five years other than yes, \\"their hero\\" (as some idiot stated) Neil Young's Prairie Wind. <br /> <br />Different styles of music of course but get this, you won't be disappointed AT ALL.  Thank god at least one band can make a comeback these days.
B000002J09|5.0|1. Black Dog..................10 - amazing vocals, and memorable guitar riff<br /><br />2. Rock And Roll..............10 - it's such a rock anthem<br /><br />3. The Battle Of Evermore.....7.2 - folk song; lyrics are about LOTR<br /><br />4. Stairway To Heaven.........10 - always been known as the greatest rock song ever; starts folk for 4 minutes, then drums kick in and becomes rock, and has the most famous guitar solo ever, and ends with memorable lyrics.<br /><br />5. Misty Mountain Hop.........8.4 - very quirky beat and singing<br /><br />6. Four Sticks................8.6 - very rock, little bluesy<br /><br />7. Going To California........7.8 - a popular folk song that i don't like that much<br /><br />8. When The Levee Breaks......9.2 - very bluesy with harmonica, but don't let that get you down...it rocks!
1860498825|3.0|I knew nothing about Sarah Waters or the story when I picked up Fingersmith; I had seen that there had been a dramatisation of it on BBC, but hadn't watched it. This is probably the best way to approach Fingersmith, as a blank page.<br /><br />You can't fault Waters' language or storytelling; the numerous twists and turns of Fingersmith are breathtaking, and you don't see them coming. What I find fault with is Water's characters.<br /><br />In the movie \\"In and Out\\", there is a wonderful scene where jilted bride Joan Cusack screams \\"Is EVERBODY gay?!\\" I have no qualms with gay or lesbian literature, but in Fingersmith, it seems no one is \\"normal\\". Heterosexual relationships (such as that between Dainty and John Vroom) are violent and dysfunctional, the men are all perverts and women are either victims or beasts themselves. Waters is shattering the myth of the \\"proper\\" Victorian age, where piano legs were covered up but in the streets, prostitution thrived. However, her approach is overly two-dimensional, making her characters flat. For instance, if Uncle Lilly is a purveyor of pornography, why would he be so outraged by his sister's affair? Surely he would recognise a kindred spirit, and have the sister be his helper, rather than shut her up in a mental instituion! Had Waters made him impotent or otherwise unable to act out his fantasies, we could then understand his rage (jealousy) and subsequent actions. But no, she keeps the Uncle as an unexplained and unexamined misogynist, \\"Gentleman\\" is a bizarrely  asexual predator who neither deflowers his bride nor overtly takes advantage of the adoring Knife-boy and Mr Ibbs as a distant secondary character.<br /><br />What rankles most is the story of the hanged murderess Mrs. Sucksby tells Susan - what is the purpose of this? All it does is make Mrs Sucksby seem prophetic and provide a terrible case of obvious foreshadowing. There is no reason to tell Sue this fiction. As all the other pieces of the puzzle fall into place, this lie remains like an unmatched piece from another game.<br /><br /> Fingersmith is a good third draft, but needs some final polishing for it to be a truly good book.

0224076051|4.0|I've been reading popular accounts of physics, esp. cosmology and quantum physics, for the past 30 years. Inevitably, the past 10 - 15  years or so a lot of these books contained many pages extolling the virtues of the new miracle theory (perpetually) on the horizon aka \\"string theory\\".  <br />I was always led to believe this theory would finally merge quantum field theory and general relativity, and soon the very first moments of the Big Bang would be a mystery no more.  <br /> <br />I should have known something was amiss. Whereas one (a non-physicist I mean) can at least understand the gist of quantum physics and general relativity with at least a minimal understanding of calculus or topology, no such luck with string theory. The message always seemed to be: \\"string theory involves very, very complicated mathematics, and except for a very few lucky people everyone is just too much of a moron to understand any of it\\".    <br /> <br />After reading Peter Woit's book, I understand why none of the popular books on string theory seem to make much sense. String theory is a dream that someday the magical formula that explains everything will pop out of the vacuum (sorry, infinite number of vacua).  <br /> <br />I will continue reading popular science books, including those of the string lovers. But this book is certainly a must read for everyone interested in the frontier of physics.   <br />
B00027JYLC|4.0|Just what is it that makes a film a `cult-classic'? Why is it that a film such as \\"Frankenstein\\" can be declared a `classic,' while at the same time its, admittedly dissimilar, sequel \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" will forever be relegated to `cult-classic' status? The term `cult' suggests a limited but devoted fan base, but I believe that the term goes beyond this definition, if only for the reason that many cult-classics are decidedly more popular than several films decreed as classics (see Frankenstein example). Ultimately, the categorization of `cult-classic' is one of genre, dictating less the popularity of a film than certain aesthetic and narrative characteristics. Classic films are typically perceived as highly polished, rigidly acted studio affairs, whereas the cult film could be described as the slightly disturbed, often rough and unruly, step-sibling of the `classic' film. Cult-classics are usually strikingly amateur in quality, often poorly filmed on bad stock, hosting a cast of unknown actors, and driven by unusual plots and campy humour. It is often the amateurish quality of the film that is, whether intended or not, ultimately the appeal. Often the `cult-classic' is a film we enjoy at, rather than with, if you get my meaning.<br /><br />\\"Freaks\\" is without a doubt a `cult-classic.' Its plot is unlike anything you would see in an `A' picture, its actors far from the usual Hollywood fare, and its technical achievements of a decidedly low grade. And yet the film is unabashed in its intentions and ultimately highly enjoyable in a good many ways. The movie is about a traveling circus and the troupe of `freaks' that are exhibited as its side-show attraction. These `freaks' are the stars of the film, and consist of people born with various abnormalities and deformities that today would be more likely politely ignored than gawked at. The story consists of one of the `normal' members of the circus, the acrobat Cleopatra, pretending to court and fall in love with one of the `freaks,' a little person named Hans, in order to gouge him for money. Cleopatra eventually marries Hans, upon learning of a secret fortune in his possession, but proceeds to spill the beans of her plot on their wedding night, and consequently incurs the wrath of Han's fellow freaks.<br /><br />The plot is not especially important and the first half of the film has honestly little to offer, aside from the display of the film's unique cast of characters. It is the latter portion of the film, wherein the freaks turn dark and menacing, that earns the film its cult-classic status. As to whether this segment is empowering, in the way director Tod Browning has his `freaks' rise up against their truly deformed oppressors, or exploitative, in its use of physically deformed people as creatures of horror, I have no answer. Once crossed, however, the exploited yet content freaks of the first half of the film turn into night-stalkers and shadowed foes worthy of any horror film. The cinematography takes on a new force at this point also, providing shots of the `freaks' creeping through rain-soaked darkness, exacting vengeance, that are among the most chilling I have seen. Again the `correctness' of this segment will pray on the minds of many viewers I am sure, but with that put aside (although a complete dismissal may not be appropriate) one can both route for and fear these pitied men, these `freaks,' who despite their own misfortunes in life have still a way to defend their own and to exact revenge against those who mock and abuse them.<br /><br />One thing that makes a cult-classic often so great is its complete lack of desire to be a classic. Films such as \\"Freaks\\" were never made to win Oscars, or even particularly large audiences, but they were made with the intention of shocking or disturbing the living hell out of the audiences they could find. And the best among them, the true cult-classics, of which \\"Freaks\\" is surely an example, continue to disturb, shock,and ultimately delight a similar minority of viewers to this day., shock, and ultimately delight a similar minority of viewers to this day.            <br />
B00005R1N3|5.0|\\"Black Christmas\\" should be spoken about in the same way horror fans talk about \\"Halloween\\" or \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\"! I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but I have to tell you I was not expecting to be as riveted, and chilled like I was while this movie played out!! There are some truly frightening moments in this film, and not the jump-at-you scares found so often in today's horror, but the slow build, tension filled kind of terror all but lost in today's flicks. If you are a fan of horror, no matter what era, YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS MOVIE!!!! Sure, some of the 70's hair-styles and fashions are tough to look at, but once you get beyond that you are going to find a gem of a horror film. The acting and directing are way above par for a 70's B-movie. I can't recommend this movie highly enough!!!!<br /><br />I know this review is fairly vague as far as the plot of the film...and there is a reason behind that. Do yourself a favor and read as few reviews posted here as possible, go into this movie not knowing what it's about, avoid any spoilers possible, just buy this DVD and set aside a 2 hour block late at night and let the story unfold. You won't be disappointed!!
B00005JOQS|2.0|I didn't like this movie, really. I watched it two times in theatres. The second time, I was totally looking for reasons to like this movie, always searching for redeeming qualities that would save the movie. But were there any? No, not really. (aside from the action sequence where Superman saves the airplane. That is about all the real excitement there is.) <br /> <br />The movie was weak; Routh and Bosworth deliver almost un-interesting performances as far as actual acting goes. Most the time they either have blank looks on their faces, or they are babbling bland dialogue. The only 'good' actor was Kevin Spacey, but his acting abilities weren't near strong enough to make up for the lack of talent on Routh and Bosworth's side of the fence.  <br /> <br />The suit: why did Bryan Singer change the suit so much? Not only does it subtract from the movie, but it is an EYE-SORE! I found it hard not to keep concentrating on how terrible the suit was... it takes away the viewer's concentration from the almost non-existant and unentertaining storyline. The reds were too dark, and the suit eats up all of Routh's muscles and makes him look like a scrawny whimp! <br /> <br />The storyline is basic: Lex Luthor wants to grow a continent out of crystals he found in the Fortress of Solitude. But not only was Singer not original, but he managed to make a plot that was pretty much already done. No one wants to see another of Lex's real-estate scams.  <br /> <br />I hope in the sequel they decide to make some improvements, and actually create a reasonable, enthralling storyline and plot that will keep the audiences at the edge of their seat... <br /> <br />And don't even get me started on the Jason kid...  <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|What if the spirit of Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and \\"Californication\\" had reincarnated? What if the music that made them uberfamous (1991) and then reintroduced them to a new generation of fans (1999) were still around? Well those questions are not mere speculations any more. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" with its 28 songs broken down into two discs has plenty for the longtime fans of the band and newcomers alike.<br /><br />Me? I became a devoted fan with \\"Californication\\" but over time have gone back and learned to respect their entire legacy. To me, still BSSM and \\"Californication\\" continue to rank as their highest accomplishments... until \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" arrived. With the two discs (named Jupiter and Mars) the Peppers' latest production ranks up there with along with their best works. These guys don't still got the magik in them: they have evolved since \\"By The Way\\", their previous album, which they've left in the dust.<br /><br />In a year that the music space was dry and boring, Red Hot has come back with one of the best albums to have been released in a good while. And with them touring the US and Canada alongside The Mars Volta over the summer of 2006, they are sure to turn even further into cult icons that continue to pave the way for new generations of musicians.
B00005JO20|5.0|The 1933 version of King Kong, which is the original, is perhaps the first film to rightfully be labeled a 'classic.' It was unique in its day and age, and was during an era where the citizens of America wanted to really watch adventure movies that had them on the edge of their seat. The entertainment industry was small back then, so you can bet that when King Kong came out, the audiences were LOVING it!    Now it is many years since then, and the citizens of America have watched many adventure/horror/monster films. Less and less films seem to be putting people at the edge of their seat, however. But this version of King Kong, which does justice to the former, really does do just that: it entertains!    Follow the characters on an epic (sometimes dull) adventure to Skull Island, where they meet savage natives who desire to sacrifice one of the main characters, Anne, to their god-on-earth: Kong. However, as time goes on, Anne and Kong experience a strong friendship. The things they went through on Skull Island (fighting dinosaurs and sliding down vines,) bring them close together. This truly is a modern-day tale of Beauty & The Beast.    Like mentioned before, some moments are dull, and the movie could have done with some editing. It is long, but perhaps rightfully so. The story is enriched in this new version, and we get to delve deeper into the characters and their psyche.     Peter Jackson undoubtedly worked tirelessly on this film: he deserves our applause!     Buy this DVD; it is definitely worth the money!
B0001LYH9S|5.0|This is a true masterpiece.  I am a Bowie fan, but not a major Bowie fan.  I have 3 or 4 of his albums.  I prefer his sound from the ninties, rock with effects and electronics.  Having said that I am also very fond of \\"Scary Monsters\\" from the eighties.  So you may be getting a feel for my preference of his very varied sounds.  This one has great, great, great songs.  The segues between the songs are brilliant and captivating.  There just are not that many albums, in music, which I would rate as high as this one.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|I like the Original Trilogy of Star Wars just as much as the next person, perhaps even moreso. These movies were classics in film history, and will never lose their status as such. Star Wars came along, and changed the way movies were made from then on. For the better? Definitely! New directors and writers aren't afraid to make fantasy or sci-fi movies anymore. We have a lot to owe to the Original Trilogy.    But do we have a lot to owe to the DVD's?    A New Hope: Lucas goes on to further change this one since he made the first real changes back in the Special Editions of 1997. Not only is Mos Eisley crowded, but we get 'new aliens' in the cantena. Sure, the graphics and CGI are good, but they subtract from the actual storyline. One instance of this is Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo by the Millenium Falcon. The CGI on this version of Jabba is just TERRIBLE to say the least: he looks like an half-finished piece of computer work that a CGI student did in college or something. Not only does he NOT look real... but he looks downright pathetic. Remarkably, he is a step-down from the CGI of 1997. In this scene, Han Solo proceeds to step on Jabba's tail. There are technical reasons for this having to do with a Jabba stand-in being originally a human, but it totally confuses the story and characters. If Jabba is such a feared and exhalted being, how could Han get away with stepping on his tail and showing BLATANT disrespect and disregard for his authority? Jabba comes across as very unscary now, thanks to the DVD and Special Editions.    The Empire Strikes Back: The change of adding in the snow-monster happened back in '97. It wasn't a plausible and useful addition to the movie: instead of being elusive and more scary, we get to see the snow monster now. I have to admit that some of the shots of Cloud City were interesting, and perhaps forgiveable. But what about the original unedited versions? Were they so bad? Did they subtract from the story? No! Not showing all of Cloud City helped the movie be more mysterious... But now the city is layed bare like a nudist woman.     The Return of the Jedi: This is the weaker movie of the Original Trilogy, in my opinion. But that is for another time and place to discuss its actual weaker points. With the exception of the abomination that was Jabba's palace, the CGI changes were almost non-existant to the naked eye, right to about the time at the end when the spirits of the Jedi are standing and watching the celebration of the Ewoks. Notice anything? Of course you noticed! Hayden Christensen has replaced Sebastian Shaw! Why? I don't know! George claims continuity... but if he really cared about continuity, he would have made the Prequel Trilogy better, wouldn't he? It is a cop out and disgrace. This is unforgivable, in my opinion.    There are some bonus features on this DVD, but they hardly make up for the bastadization of the actual movies. Such as commentary (sub-par commentary by sound effects artists, George Lucas, and the director of ESB.)    Also, there is a documentary called 'Empire of Dreams.' THAT is indeed worth watching, if you fail to understand the point of view that older fans of the Original Trilogy have of Star Wars and its legacy.     Do I suggest buying this DVD? No. Would it be a good edition to your collection of ridiculous and cop out editions of classic movies? Yes.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Boy does Mel Gibson like torture.  It's hard to think of a Mel Gibson movie that doesn't involve someone (often Mel) suffering prolonged, excruciating pain.  I'm sure there are exceptions (I didn't see Air America).    Usually the torture is part of the plot, but in this movie the torture is the plot.  The victim is Jesus Christ, who recovers and goes on to be one of the most worshipped people in history.  In fact he's currently #1, with a substantial lead over Allah and Buddha.    In Lethal Weapon 1 Mel Gibson plays Martin Riggs, who is tortured by a diabolical character named Endo, but then recovers and goes on to shoot Gary Busey and have Christmas dinner with Danny Glover.    Mel Gibson was inspired to make The Passion of the Christ by his very literal interpretation of The New Testament of the Bible (also a huge bestseller, ranked #1 ahead of \\"Quotations from Chairman Mao\\" and \\"The American Spelling Book\\").    Possible sequel:  In the future, when fuel shortages and global disasters triggered by conflicts over oil have plunged our ancestors into a dystopian nightmare populated by ruthless gangs who terrorize innocent civilians in search of gasoline, people turn for solace to a historical record of someone who can offer them salvation.  Naturally they find the Lethal Weapon Box Set, and a new religion is formed around a heroic man who was able to withstand torture and abuse in the name of all that is good.  Riggsianity is born!

B000A0GYD2|5.0|Some customers have complained that this version has been chopped from the original.  This is untrue. <br />The original was shot in widescreen, and then cropped (\\"pan & scan\\") for television broadcast.  The first release of the DVD set included all of the episodes as broadcast, in the television aspect ratio.  What you get here is a remastered version of all of the episodes, restored to thier original widescreen aspect ratio.  The listing on IMDB does not list what the show was originally shot in, but only what it was originally produced in. <br /> <br />This is definitely the definitive version of the series.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|As I listened to this set the first time, I was struck by the clarity and quality of the remixes.  Every track sounds better than ever!  Next - the selection and sequence began to remind me of Paul McCartney's \\"Wingspan\\" (will the parallels between these two men ever end?).  Even though Yoko was responsible for this, you had a sense of it being a near mirror-image of Paul's effort.  One big similarity stands out:  the self-indulgence of some of the deep-cut selections.  As Paul includes a lot of his cutesy album cuts (\\"Bip-bop\\", \\"Waterfalls\\", \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"Backseat of my Car\\",) that only he would like, so Yoko selects the most gag-me Yoko this, Yoko that cuts.  \\"You Are Here\\", and \\"Oh Yoko\\" for instance, could have given way to \\"How Do You Sleep\\", \\"Crippled Inside\\", \\"Old Dirt Road\\", \\"Remember\\", and \\"You Can't Catch Me\\".  But really, I'm not complaining - I'm pretty sure John would have wanted the Yoko cuts in there.  As a fan of both John and Paul, I have to say that hearing their selections does tell us a little more about them (in this case Yoko), and either way. I enjoy it.<br /><br />But CD2 . . . oh baby!  First we get this delicious alternate cut of \\"I'm Losing You\\".  That alone makes this \\"yet another\\" greatest hots package worth it.  But as I progressed further down the track list on CD2, I wondered what I was going to get when \\"Real Love\\" played (I do not have the John Lennon Anthology).  Would it be the home-made scratch demo of the Imagine soundtrack?  NO - it was the final arrangement of the song,  a wonderful, beautiful rendition featuring John and the piano.  I was thrilled to hear that the Beatles Anothology version was not the Threetles spinning of John's concept.  All they did was layer instruments and background vocals onto a completed product.  What a thrill to learn that the introduction and breaks are all John.  John writes beautiful melodies with massive hooks, without Paul - and sometimes it is so good that even Paul will not mess with it!<br /><br />But that's not all . . .<br /><br />Again, with \\"Grow Old With Me\\", I wondered what I would be getting.  The version that I know already, is the scratch demo from Milk and Honey, a syrupy, almost affected sappy thing that I thought John wrote to show how timeless and classic his love for Yoko was (more John and Yoko blah blah blah).  I could picture John quickly writing it at the Dakota some afternoon, in between folding laundry and watching soaps.<br /><br />But wait!  Produced by George Martin?  I dared to hope that it would sound good!  And indeed - like \\"Good Night\\" on the White Album, this is definitely a Beatles-era George Martin production.  And what a way to end this mega-set!<br /><br />Did I sense some ice thawing?  A George Martin production on a John Lennon album? A first-time (almost) release of essentially a Beatles song, on a Lennon album?  Folks, this arrangement is so beautiful musically, that when you realize that Yoko is tipping her hat to the Beatles and Martin, with the closing song of this set, it almost seems like a missing track from the Anthology.  And it shows what can happen to a John Lennon composition when someone other than himself or Phil Spector gets a ahold of it!<br /><br />Grow Old With Me is like a little Beatles reunion, in a sense.  I just love the way it closes out this anthology!<br /><br />These three tracks gave me my money's worth.<br /><br />And now - I am wondering how many other Beatles or near-Beatles songs are STILL hidden away down in some vault?r /> <br />But that's not all . . .  <br /> <br />Again, with \\"Grow Old With Me\\", I wondered what I would be getting.

B000003TAR|5.0|This is Nirvana's 2nd major label album and is probably a perfect mixture of Grunge and Experimental Rock. This is exactly the way Kurt wanted the music to sound. Heavier. Weirder. Greater. I don't know if you'll like it if you're not a fan of Nirvana. <br /> <br />Serve The Servants: [4/5] A nice opening track. Once you listen to this, you will be drawn into the masterpiece and will love this whole album. I really like the lyrics. <br /> <br />Scentless Aprentice: [5/5] This is an awesome song. The main riff is a masterpiece and the chorus is just madness (in a good way). Perfect and one of the best tracks. <br /> <br />Heart-Shaped Box: [5/5] This is the hit from In Utero with a great verse and a very excellent chorus. The distress in Kurt's voice is great and the solo is a fuzzy masterpiece as well. <br /> <br />Rape Me: [5/5] The controversial song. I don't see the problem with it and it has the great chorus. If you watch their preformance on Saturday Night Live, you'll automaticlly love it. <br /> <br />Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle: [5/5] One of my favourites on this track. The verses are catchy and I really like the one that has the heavy strumming and feedback while it's supposed to be clean. Genious. <br /> <br />Dumb: [5/5] Cool and laid-back song.  <br /> <br />Very Ape- [5/5] This is a weird song with cool lyrics and the chorus's guitar playing is mind twisting. Too bad it couldn't be longer. <br /> <br />Milk It- [5/5] Don't be fooled by the intro because this is a great song. The depressing lyrics and screaming choruses are so awesome. <br /> <br />Pennyroyal Tea- [5/5] This is my favourite Nirvana song because its acoustic and then the distortion comes on and the singing is wonderful. <br /> <br />Radio Friendly Unit Shifter- [4/5] The feedback in the beginning is cool and I really like the bass line and guitar work in this song. <br /> <br />Tourrette's: [5/5] Cool punk song, and do note that there is acual lyrics to the song.  <br/> <br />All Apologies: [5/5] An awesome closer because it has nice lyrics and the chorus has distortion even though its a ballad and the ending is really cool too. <br /> <br />Another great Cd from Nirvana. Get it if your a fan

B00005QG9J|5.0|Since \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" Incubus has kept impressing me. \\"Morning View\\" is another example of a great release by the band. Of course things have changed since then but it isn't for the worse. No that didn't happen until \\"A Crow Left Of The Murder\\", I'm not too big on that album. Anyway back on the subject at hand. \\"Morning View\\" is a little softer than the others but that doesn't make it bad by any means. It's actually really great. It's not quite as good as the others but it's still awesome nonetheless. My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Nice To Know You\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"11am\\", and \\"Have You Ever\\". Here are my track ratings...<br /><br />1. Nice To Know You - 10/10<br /><br />2. Circles - 10/10<br /><br />3. Wish You Were Here - 10/10<br /><br />4. Just A Phase - 9/10<br /><br />5. 11am - 10/10<br /><br />6. Blood On The Ground - 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Mexico - 9/10<br /><br />8. Warning - 9.5/10<br /><br />9. Echo - 8/10<br /><br />10. Have You Ever - 10/10<br /><br />11. Are You In? - 9/10<br /><br />12. Under My Umbrella - 9.5/10<br /><br />13. Aqueous Transmission - 7/10<br /><br />Overall: 93% A-<br /><br />This is just another example of how awesome this band is. It just seems they always give me something to love with each release. The really cool thing is that with each cd it's all unique and different from the last in some way. It just helps show that Incubus is a band of all its own.

B00005JNEI|1.0|The biggest lie in this movie slipped past just about everybody. Michael Moore says in this movie, not a documentary, that we attacked a country that never killed an American. How did everyone forget the attack by an Iraqi jet using French made weapons, two exocet missiles, fired from a French made mirage jet fighter on the USS Stark that killed  thirty-seven sailors March 17, 1987 ?  That was an act of war that was never really settled.  Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> <br />
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham has done it again. I had read this book originally a year after release. And I just finished my second read. And though it all started to come back to me as I read it...It was still an exciting page-turner as it was the first time. That says a lot about this book.    A self-made billionaire, the tenth richest man in America, has all his heirs come in to prove he is sane and competent before signing his last Will and Testament. Which he does, right before he commits suicide in front of those still present. And of course as he leaves out each and every known heir from his will. And as you learn how greedy and selfish they are, you are pleased he did.    He does pay off all his children's debt and leaves the remainder of his holdings to his illegitimate daughter no one knew he had. Nor does anyone know where she is. His law firm sends a drug/alcohol addict just out of rehab for the fourth time to find her. He finds her an M.D. who has dedicated her life to God and is working deep in the jungles of Brazil.    I found the book a very fast read that has some plot twist and is well written. Well worth the read.
B000025H0Q|5.0|I have a hard time understanding why Drake didn't make it into the bigger time. I can so easily picture him doing a \\"classic\\" Saturday night live performance in the mid-70s. Some of these songs sound a little like Joni Mitchell, do they not? He is regarded as not fitting into the era he was born into, but from my standpoint, his music is of that era, and is some of the finest music of that era. You can put him in the category of Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Van Morrison, Steven Stills, Neil Young, Arlo Guthrie, John Sebastian, and other early 70s acoustic-based singer/songwriters. He fits right in there, yet is also very uniqie and influential on many of today's singer/songwiters.  <br />I wished somone could have kept him alive and forced him to do more live work. I'm reading a biography on him now, and I read that some audiences gave him a hard time...yet, this should not have disouraged him from performing altogether. I read that Tom Waits was booed, quite severely in fact, when he was opening for Frank Zappa once. Also, I recall that Niel Young--yes, the great Niel Young--was booed quite severely when opening at a Pearl Jam show! So, given these examples, it is safe to say that being booed occasionally goes with the trade of being a performer, even for the very greatest, and Drake should have definitely kept going, especially at his tender age (he had just turned 21 when his first album came out, and recorded Byter Layer when he was 21-22 years old).  <br />I only hope that his soul reincarnated into a life that was more successful, and that he achieved, finally, the success that was due to him. <br /> <br />
0452285186|1.0|I can't believe a human being would actually laugh at this sort of thing.  Watching rabbits die is NOT funny.  They are tender, adorable loving creatures that mother nature brought into this world for people to respect.  You're not supposed to enjoy suicide bunny stories.  Please don't buy this book.  I don't want a book like this falling into the hands of an innocent child.  Even an adult purchasing something like this is wrong on SO many levels.

B00006RCPM|4.0|Science fiction films have always been films that can either be really enjoyable or pretty silly.  This one delivers, fortunately.  Tom Cruise's character is really good and exciting throughout the movie.  Sometimes it may appear like he's not always on his game but by the end of the film you'll agree that his performance was wonderful.  You simply must give Minority Report a serious watch.
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins were a wonder for the world of music in the 1990s, and their music still lives on today.  Primarily, in \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" a glorious double album with more than a few wonderful, immersing songs, and, arguably, absolutely no filler material whatsoever. <br /> <br />At slightly over two hours in length, the album is divided into two discs: \\"Dawn to Dusk,\\" and \\"Twilight to Starlight.\\"  The first disc starts out with the title track, \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" a solemn piece, but beautiful and absorbing, with a piano prevailing.  Then the famous \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" comes along, featuring amazing songwriting, both musically and lyrically.  The album then dives down into a long set of hard rock, including \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" which spawned the famous \\"Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage\\" line.  Toward, and at, the end of the first disc, the music softens and lightens, including my personal favorite from the entire album, the sometimes underrated (in my opinion) \\"Muzzle.\\" <br /> <br />The second disc, \\"Twilight to Starlight,\\" dives quickly back into the heavier, angrier stuff, with a softer one thrown in here and there, such as \\"Thirty-Three\\" and the famous \\"1979,\\" nostalgic and reminiscing.  Toward the end, the album finally once again mellows out, with songs of love and beauty, such as \\"Lily (my one and only)\\" and \\"By Starlight.\\"  Topping it all off is \\"Farewell and Goodnight,\\" ending with a great piano sequence, excellent in itself, but also rather reminiscent of the album's title track, way back at the very beginning. <br /> <br />John Craig's accompanying illustrations are also interesting, bizarre beyond any doubt, and, one could say, almost grotesque in their obscurity.  There are rabbits playing baseball and smoking a hookah, children carrying a goat through a field of flowers, human-shaped felines joining in holy wedlock, and strange birds flying in odd war planes.  On the frontof the album is an angelic woman emerging from a star surrounded by planets, stars, and comets, and on the back, a smiling sun peeks over the ocean through a cloudy sky. <br /> <br />Billy Corgan, the lead singer, whines, rasps, and goes off-key.  I won't deny that.  However, to me, and to the many fans of this brilliant music, singing isn't so much about voice clarity and pitch control as it is about passion and emotion, which Corgan donates to the music like has rarely, if ever, been seen before in any production.  The entire album is filled with all different emotions: happy, sad, angry, loving.  This is the case with many albums, but often these emotions are just slapped together.  Here, they are woven into a delicate flow.  The lyrics are thought-provoking, the songwriting is creative, and the instruments are superbly played.  The drum rhythms particularly appeal to me, especially in \\"Muzzle,\\" and may very well to others also. <br /> <br />This album is a masterpiece.  It is one of those few pieces of artwork which can truly survive the tests of time, not like crappy faddish mainstream stuff (no offense intended to any fans of crappy faddish music =D ).
B000FGGE68|1.0|This movie was horrible. It had awesome ideas that were all just kind of thrown together retardedly.  Good special effects.  It was a big disappointment.
0812976525|5.0|It's hard to find someone who roots for the tobacco industry.  I sure don't, having lost loved ones, directly and indirectly, to smoking.  I guess I'd be listed as, in Nick Naylor-ese, a \\"Gasper.\\"  Yet you can't help but love a guy who is depicted as completely, utterly, amoral, as Chris Buckley has done in this great book. <br /> <br />Nick Naylor is, in fact, a tobacco spokesman working for a large tobacco lobbyist.  Able to hide his knowledge behind distracting language, good looks, and an uncanny ability to deflect the main issues toward a discussion of utter nonsense, he is the perfect person for such a job in this novel set in the '90s.  He's able to because this is just before the record tobacco settlement where \\"Big Tobacco\\" HAD to divulge most of its \\"trade secrets.\\"  Nick is not ignorent, just dedicated to doing the best job he can.  He's not perfect, in fact, he's too smart for his own good, a character flaw that he realizes later.  His journey takes him from the main office of his boss, who is trying to replace Nick with his pseudo-dominatrix girlfriend, to the stage of the Oprah Winfrey show, viciously attacking a Health and Human Services shill while surrounded by societal do-gooders and an unfortunate high schooler stricken with cancer. In short, Nick is \\"us,\\" a man stuck with a thankless job dealing with a loathsome boss and trying to relieve this tension by doing what \\"Yuppie-enablers\\" do - namely becoming the lobby chairman's fair-haired boy, being electrocuted-as-therapy by his osteopath, drinking his midday meals with fellow \\"Merchants Of Death\\" (fellow spokespeople for the gun and alcohol lobbies), endless sex with said boss' girlfriend, reporters, and his secretary, and, of course, smoking, smoking, smoking. <br /> <br />Chris Buckley is as erudite as his father, while not assuming everyone else is less intelligent.  He also has a fair way with wit and satire, depicting folks we'd rather see as villains being heroes by showing them in mere extensions of what we deal with every day, except that the heroes here work with things that will kill us.  It's the normalcy mixed with the ridiculous that makes \\"Thank You\\" work as pure comedy.  The reader finds that it's the very things that we think are bad are actually funny - if one is stuck in the tough job of making them palatible to the general public.  Yes, there is salvation for Nick and his friends - the one thing in the whole book that seems rushed and ill-planned - but in the end, Nick remains Nick, and that makes the book sweet. <br /> <br />By the way, the movie based on this, while still uproariously funny and true to its spirit, is significantly different in story.  But equally as enjolyable.
B00000AFGM|3.0|This cd has always been something of a frustration for me as a Manson fan, as I believe there was a lot more potential here than this album achieved. <br /> <br />To begin with, this album came immediately after Antichrist Superstar, which was then and always will be the definitive and greatest Manson album.  Manson therefore wisely decided to alter styles slightly, and go for more classic rock 'n' roll and ballad sounds on this album. <br /> <br />Some of these songs are absolute classics, such as the anthem for the masses \\"Rock Is Dead\\", and the AC/DC-esque \\"New Model No. 15.\\"  This cd also features two of the most beautiful songs Manson has ever written, namely Coma White and The Last Day On Earth.  For all those who say Manson is a one-trick pony, whose only good music is hard-as-hell head-banging tunes, the emotion and and nostalgia/romance evident in these tracks may be very surprising.  This cd also features one of Manson's highest selling songs of all time, \\"The Dope Show\\", which is a glaring indictment of 20th century society and the Hollywood lifestlye that artists and performers are able to live.  This is also reinforced by the track that is perhaps Manson's tongue-in-cheek justification of his own lifestlye, \\"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me).\\" <br /> <br />However, included with these offerings are some of the more disapponting tracks that Manson has released.  The title track \\"Mechanical Animals\\", \\"Disassociative\\", \\"The Speed of Pain\\", \\"Posthuman\\" and \\"I Want to Disappear\\" all fall short of the standard set by the better songs on this album.  What is even more disappointing is that the message or themes of these songs seem largely confused or even irrelevant, which is a real let-down following on from the deep, significant meanings behind almost all tracks from Antichrist Superstar. <br /> <br />I think the main problem this cd has is that the persona created by Manson for this album, that of rock-star Omega, was never going to be as monumentally significant as his previous personification of the Antichrist Superstar. In many ways, this cd suffers from comparison to its peerless predecessor.  It deserves three and a half stars, as there are real moments of Manson brilliance in this album, but as I cannot include half-stars in the gradings I will settle for three stars.
B0009UC810|1.0|Are DVDs playable all over the world or is there a geographical limit? We could not get this to play
B000929AJQ|3.0|One of the major problems facing many artists is that, once they have released an all-time classic album, us heartless music fans want, nay DEMAND, equal or greater brilliance from any future albums.  Just ask the Young brothers (Angus and Malcolm) how much pressure they felt after AC/DC released \\"Back in Black\\". It is little coincidence that it took Acca Dacca almost a decade to finally achieve another cult-rock offering, the inimitable \\"Thunderstruck.\\" <br /> <br />Such was the problem faced by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails with the release of With Teeth.  This album was following on from not only one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, The Downward Spiral, but also from Trent's most sophisticated and complex offering, The Fragile.  What's worse is that with a six-year gap between albums, fans were expecting something special from With Teeth. <br /> <br />And, to be perfectly honest, there is nothing truly special here.  In comparison to all albums released in 2005 (boy bands and Britney Spears et. al.), this album ranks very highly.  In comparison to the other albums released by Nine Inch Nails, this album ranks as one of the worst. <br /> <br />The major problem is that, with all of his other abums, Trent was achieving real, ground-breaking progress in the development of a new and unique style of music.  Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral and The Fragile all seemed to take his music to a new level of originality.  With Teeth makes no forward momentum whatsoever in this regard, and thus will never achieve the cult status reserved for the Nine Inch Nails albums preceeding it. <br /> <br />There ARE, however, still some moments of musical brilliance on this cd, from the opening ballad \\"All the Love in the World\\" and the fascinating final few songs \\"Sunspots\\", \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" and \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\" <br /> <br />However, there are some major disappointments in between. <br /> <br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" seems to be a shallow attempt by Trent to recapture some of the rage that was evident in his previous albums, but he clearly doesn't have that anger and dissatisfaction anymore.  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is almost painfully like a contemporary pop song, a style that most would never expect or want to hear Trent reverting to.  \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\", \\"Only\\" and the title track \\"With Teeth\\" are both impeded by over-indulgent musical refrains that detract enormously from the lyrics and 'meat' of the tracks. <br /> <br />But most importantly, these songs all seem to be rehashes of old styles, most notably those evident in Pretty Hate Machine.  This album gets three stars because there are some great moments and tracks here, reminding us all that Trent and Nine Inch Nails are still capable of achieving the type of musicianship that ranks them as an all-time great band.  However, this album pales into insignificance when compared to the band's previous offerings, and frankly does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral or The Fragile. <br /> <br />Put simply, Trent seemed capable of writing better music when he was an angry, substance-abusing young man.  I am sure that he has achieved more happiness and satisfaction in his life as a well-adjusted member of society.  Unfortunately for music fans everywhere, it seems that the contentment in Trent's life has eroded the intensity and angst which made him one of the greatest musicians of the 1990s.

B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is an absolute masterpiece, whether Christians and conservatives choose to admit it or not.  For all the positive attributes of Lest We Forget, the band's greatest hits album, the truth of the matter is that this cd could undergo a track-by-track comparison with Lest We Forget and still come out on top.  This truly is Manson at his absolute best, and although his next two albums (Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood) were also of a very high standard, he has never come close to re-attaining the heights he achieved with Antichrist Superstar.  A large part of this success must be attributed to Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), who was responsible for producing the album, and also performed in several of the tracks. <br /> <br />The cd begins with the song that bascially encapsulates all that Manson and the band represent, Irresponsible Hate Anthem.  This track fades out immediately into one of the greatest rock/metal songs of all time, The Beautiful People.  Even for people who hate Manson and what he stands for, or dislike heavy metal music in general, the greatness of this track is undeniable. <br /> <br />The cd also features other songs that must rank as some of Manson's greatest, such as the death metal ballad Little Horn, the creepy and beautiful Cryptorchid, and the classic tracks Deformography, Worm Boy, Angel with the Scabbed Wings, and Mister Superstar. <br /> <br />However, Manson reaches new heights with the heaviest song on the cd, The Reflecting God.  This is intense, loud, head-banging music at its absolute best, and along with The Beautiful People would survive comparison with any other rock/metal song of the 1990s. <br /> <br />But most all-time classic cds are recognised for more than just the music, and such is the case here.  This isn't just a cd: it is the very establishment of a cult figure in contemporary society. This is THE Manson album that all his fans rave about, that parents tut-tut over, and that church groups everywhere are up in arms about.  Whether you like the man or not, whether you like the music or not, you cannot deny the power and reputation of this cd, which spread the image of Manson across all four corners of the globe. <br /> <br />Depending on who you speak to, Marilyn Manson may or may not be the Antichrist.  But as a result of this cd, he is unquestionably a Superstar.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I've been a fan of Firefly since it first started on television a few years ago. I never got a chance to see all of the episodes though before it was canceled so when I found out it was on DVD I jumped at my chance to buy it. <br />The entire first season (and unfortunately the only season) is on these four DVDs including a couple that were never put on tv. The only thing about the set that I would have changed is to have more special features. There are a couple very nice commentaries though and a gag reel. <br />This is a must have for an Firefly fans out there!

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I remember seeing this at the theatre so many years ago and even as a kid, I knew I loved it.  I have always loved dance and so this back then was a main draw for me.  But now as an adult, I can really truly appreciate the talent of Mikhail Baryshnikov ('Koyla') and Gregory Hines (Raymond).  These guys are/were legends. <br />As a kid, I didn't understand/care for the political side of the movie (why they wanted to get out of Russia), but I get it now and it makes the story so much more than about dance only.  It is such a great film, that while dated now, is still very enjoyable and great to re-watch again and show to younger people as well to see these genius' dance together.  I can't wait to throw away my VHS copy and replace it by this long awaited DVD edition.
1401201911|4.0|I am not a fan of superman.  I think he is ridiculously overpowered and since his creation he gets a new ridiculous power every 3-5 years. <br /> <br />BUT, I enjoyed this immensely.  Some other reviewers have complained about various other characters being in different positions that they don't believe they would have occupied just because they didn't meet superman.  I think most of it is plausable  and when it isn't, it's more interesting to put known characters in a different situation than to just make up new ones to fill places in the plot.  I don't see what others are complaining about.
B000A59PMO|5.0|...that you should be watching Veronica Mars. Heck, you should stop reading this review and buy the first season. I did. I bought it with only having seen three episodes. I was a latecomer to the world of lovely Ms Mars. I had seen Joss Whedon talking about it on Whedonesque and even bits here and there about Allyson Hannigan being on the show once and awhile but still I stayed away. UPN? I wasn't even sure what number it might be on my cable list? Surely, it's not a marked favorite channel on my Tivo! Then CBS decided to air two episodes back to back on primetime. So I watched and... man was I wrong! Here's this great show, this weekly mystery novel in TV format that leaves me breathless and eager for the next episode. Noir ala high school. Like Buffy with Horror ala high school, VM gets into the drama of what it's like to be a teenager and much, much more. And VM has drama. It has sweeping Shakespearian tragedy drama set in a high school. It's also funny and delightfully wicked and clever (hell, it's brilliant) and exciting and... well, people it's what good TV should be.<br /><br />So why aren't you watching? Here's your chance! Buy first season. Watch it in a few weeks then buy season two (which in many ways is even better than season one - like Alias Season 2 to the first year) and watch Season Three when it airs in September. You will be able to watch and enjoy VM, gloat over others who don't, and go online and geek out with the rest of us VMers.<br /><br />Long live Mars!
1582403589|5.0|My all time favorite movie is George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead.  Every time I watch the movie I just really enjoy myself.  The first time I watched the movie I was positively ecastic...then it ended.  What happens after that?  Where do the remaining characters go/do? <br /> <br />In the introduction to the series Robert Kirkman expressed identical sentiments and says that this will be a series that won't just abruptly end.  I've read the first four volumes and I have to say I have not been dissapointed for a moment. <br /> <br />The artwork is really well done, and the dialogue is good too.  This IS NOT just another zombie comic.  This has all the intelligent social commentary and situation exploration that caused George A. Romero's series to blow every other zombie movie out of the water.  Not to say that there is any lack of animated rotting corpses in the pages of this book. <br />Fans who appreciate all aspects of the subgenre will definitely appreciate this comic on multiple levels.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|So having seen the second season on TV (thank god for Tivo), I knew I had to own it. My fianc&eacute; is getting to a big Veronica Mars fan and I really wanted to watch the second season with her.<br /><br />As I knew, we weren't let down. The second season is amazing. From the cameos (Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon - it was like a \\"geekgasm\\" for me), to the great storylines (stand-alones and season-long arcs), to the characters (Logan, even better in this season than last, Duncan, who I actually liked, Kendall (and that great scene when Allyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter get all bitchy with each other - it was like old Buffy times!) and even Beaver! Kristin Bell's acting is unbelievable and why she doesn't get nominated for an Emmy is beyond me!<br /><br />One of the best things has been to watch it with her and see her discover all the great things about the second season with her. All the twists and fantastic character moments. All the heartbreaks and laughs. God this show is amazing!<br /><br />A word about the DVD packaging itself: nice. It's a more tight system and the extras are packed with stuff. A lot better than the first set. Not to mention the sound and the transfer look great! Good DVD job!<br /><br />So, to sum it up: Veronica Mars is the best show no one but us diehard VMers are watching! And part of me likes that because I know good TV and others just don't have a... well, a clue.
0375831002|5.0|This novel contains so many thematic threads that one must be careful not to pin it down as an anti-war story or a condemnation of the Holocaust or a study of how language influences our lives or an extended parable about good and evil or stepchildren or poverty. Markus Zusak takes all these threads and weaves a brilliant tapestry depicting the life of a poor girl who becomes the foster child of a poor German couple struggling to make a living during Hitler's reign of terror. He offers readers a cast of characters who touch us in far-reaching and wide-ranging ways. He offers an edgy narrator, Death himself, who is far from an archetypal Grim-Reaper. This Death is, despite his omnipresence in the world, confused by and fearful of humanity. He is also affable, sardonic, and witty, but he insists, \\"not nice.\\"     Through the life of Liesel, the book thief, Zusak reassures us that the combination of words and story-telling and love have redemptive power--for characters and readers alike.    I suppose that because Zusak has written for young adults in the past, this book has been thoughtlessly labled \\"young adult,\\" as well. On this point, I suppose the book can speak for itself. One of the characters writes a story for Liesel and has this to say about it: \\"I thought you might be too old for such a tale, but maybe no one is.\\" Please read this book and reap the double reward of excellent storytelling and outstanding writing.
B000301YY8|4.0|OK we've all heard James Blunt's song You're Beautiful on either the radio or the TV but the album is more than that.  For a start you have to really listen to the words and I just love his voice.  The album has some adult language but I don't think that detracts from the songs which I have been playing over and over since I bought the album.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the Beatles but I think James has been influenced by them at some point.  Move over Robbie Williams you've got competition!
B00006JSS8|4.0|I have been such a huge fan of Stevie Wonder since I was a little girl.  I have bought other Stevie compilations before, but was really blown away by this in particular.  It was well put together, and flows pretty well from one song to the other.  A good buy for all the \\"popular\\" songs of Mr. Wonder.  Buy this and pop it in the car cd player and settle in for a long drive across country.  Will keep you entertained and smiling!
0767834739|1.0|To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didnt even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didnt even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series.
B0002W18MU|5.0|Many performers, and quite a few artists as well, might have recoiled from the idea of recording an album during what they were all to aware of were their final months. For Johnny Cash the choice to make this album was in total synch with much of his public life. Throughout the 1960s when drugs and demons kept a dark cold hand on him and a long shadow over him, Cash turned out ground breaking album after ground breaking album, any one of which could have been his last. Remembering those years I'm reminded of the quote from Merle Haggard's first attempt at biography where Hag recalled his experience meeting Cash backstage in the early 1960's. Hag recalled his impression watching Cash stalk the stage, in total command of his sound and his audience, then seeing him shaking, scarcrow shallow, and trying to score his next fix in the men's room.  Hag wrote of coming away with the sense that John Cash would change the face of American music . . . provided he lived long enough to do it.<br /><br />Cash more than lived long enough, but wrapped in his sound and his larger than life existance was the ever present challenge of keeping death and so much more from dragging him down. The victory for Cash, for his fans, and for music in general was that the end came when it did, after his work here was mostly done.<br /><br />The song selection on American V is intriguing, both in terms of the songs Johnny Cash chose to spend his final months singing - and given the nature of the American recordings where more vocal tracks were recorded than found their way onto the CD, the choices made by Rick Rubin and John Carter Cash also factor in so far as the songs they wanted to have a part of what baring future archival releases will be thought of as his 'final album'<br /><br />The performances are uniformally effective. Back in the day Johnny's destructive ways took their toll on more than a few live shows. Now the difficulty he sometimes had getting breath and vocal strength only add gravity and character. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the opening track, 'Help Me' He rebounds in power and hard earned wisdom in the second track, where he makes the old standard \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" his own in much the same way that he did with 'Hurt' or American IV.<br /><br />From there each track is loaded with meaning.  It depends in large part on the individual listener and context which songs penetrate most deeply. I find it telling about Johnny's reach that several reviewers here have spoken of Johnny covering 'Four Strong Winds' and referring to it as a Neil Young song. The song was actually penned by Canadian Ian Tyson back in the 1960's and first recorded by Ian and Sylvia. Mr. Young was just one of many singers who'd recorded it since. While my favorite version remains the one Ian recorded solo for his 1989 CD \\"I Outgrew the Wagon\\", Johnny's cover is to my ear the most transformative. Much the same can be said for the new meaning he gives Canadian Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\".<br /><br />Johnny has been covering Bruce Springsteen since 1983 when he plucked a pair of songs, 'Johnny 99' and 'Highway Patrolman' off Bruce's stark and accustic 'Nebraska' album.  (Using the former as the title track for a strong CD which saw little commerical attention, coming as it did during the early 1980's when the Nashville establishment did its damndest to put Johnny out to pasture so that we could be treated to more Eddie Rabbit). At the time Johnny's more crafted and fuller versions gave the songs depth that to some ears they'd been denied by the raggedness of Bruce's recordings. On this CD the effect is somewhat different, Johnny's paring down of 'Further on up the Road' gives the song an intenisty that the origional lacked.<br /><br />Also interesting is the presence of the last song Johnny wrote 'Like the 309' which is a contemplation of his coming fate and the Hank Williams cover 'On the Evening Train'.  While Johnny's influence acrossthe vast scope of American music exceeds Hank's, the two men rank together at the top of post 1950 Country Music. Hank burned up and out in his 20's and did the dying young thing (age 29 - probably the oldest looking 29 yr old I ever saw ) that Johnny narrowly avoided. At the time of his death, drunk and sick in the back seat of a Cadillac somewhere in West Virginia Hank's most recent single had been the foreboding \\"I'll Never get out of This World Alive\\"  In many ways, allowing for the differences between 1953 and 2003, as well as the differences in song writing style between Hank and Johnny, 'Like the 309' calls Hank's parting effort to mind.<br /><br />As for the Hank penned song Johnny covered, I'm not familiar with the origional, but it sounds more like something that would have been issued under Hank's 'Luke the Drifter' alter ego. Many today forget that there were two Hanks, the one who lived in and cronicaled the world of beer joints, cheatin women and lonesom broken hearts, and the Luke character, morose and morbid who walked weary and wise through a world of funerals, deathbed old mothers and careworn Christian caution, sending pictures from life's other side in the hope that someone would head his words even though Hank himself never could. Back in the day the marketing boys thought Hank's hard living commercial success would be blunted if his cautionary and worried Luke songs were released under his name, hence Luke The Drifter was slapped on labels as a way of telling Hank's core audience 'no fast living here, but don't worry, ol Hank will be back drunker than ever next month'.<br /><br />With Johnny there has never been the partitioning, diverse themes and songs coexist on all of his best albums and that element of the man was summed up quite well by daughter Roseanne in her 1984 song 'My Old Man', \\"He believes what he says he believes, but that don't make him a saint\\".<br /><br />I hear the echos of that song a lot as I listen to this CD . . .remembering other lines \\"The old man's lonesome tonight / and he just wants to go home / and all the fools who stand in his way / why wont they leave him alone\\"<br /><br />Kris Krisstofferson wrote a song about Johnny too . . .spoke of 'taking every wrong direction on that lonely way back home' Looking over Johnny Cash's life and journeys, 100 highways is an understatement, tired and weary from it all he's offered up a memorable fairwell before leaving us for that final trip home.uence across the vast scope of American music exceeds Hank's, the two men rank together at the top of post 1950 Country Music.

B00020X88O|5.0|I have seen the movie several times & I love it. It is in my top 15 movies. <br /> <br />When people say the entertainment busines is not all glamourous happy happy joy joy ,I'm going to get famous & rich. They are right. If you don't believe them. Watch This movie. This is what they are talking about. <br /> <br />Gina & Elizabeth were awesome & I loved what Nami did for her friend at the end. <br /> <br />I don't have the box set yet,but I do have the original DVD,a movie poster & The Soundtrack. So I'm a fan. Believe it or not there should be a sequel somehow.
0743201140|4.0|Purchase of this book gives access to an online assessment tool (access code is printed on the inside of the book jacket) that determines the top 5 of 34 talents/strengths.  It has helped me to understand some areas of myself around which I'd felt conflicted that I can cultivate instead of trying to suppress.  My only criticism is that I would like more detailed descriptions of the strengths in the text--but other than that, well worth the price.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Just when you thought that Van Hunt couldn't do any better, he goes and creates a sophomore effort that sounds more confident and potentially fulfilled than his debut. Not only that, nearly every song sounds more like a Van Hunt song. Highlights on this album include the sleazy 'If I Take You Home (Upon..)', the drop-dead funk of 'Hot Stage Lights', the powerful rockers 'Ride Ride Ride' and 'At The End Of A Slow Dance', the attractive pop of 'The Thrill Of This Love' and the innocent but funky 'Being A Girl.' Hell, Every song is perfect. It just took me a while to pick my favourite because every song is that good. You will not regret this should you purchase this (And believe me, you should). Excellent album.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|All perfomances were well videographed. Sound quality was great. Lots of close ups of the performers and of the crowd.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Okay, I love this album. I recommend it to anyone who is anyone. My only problem is with the new remaster.     The first time I purchsed this CD I was aware that the sound quality wouldn't be as good as most CDs. When I put it on I was amazed. I thought the sound quality was incredible with the excepton of the drums being tinny at times. I picked up a vinyl copy at a pawn shop and it sounded just as good.    With all the reviews I had read on this very page, I had forced myself to sell my old CD and buy the new one, and I did just that yesterday, with a difference of $10 being paid. When I put it on I was expecting something completely different. I was excited once I heard the intro to the first song fade in faster, but then it seemed nothing else was happening. Prior to buying this copy I had burned my old one for comparison, so I began doing that. From what I could hear, the sound was indeed fuller than the original, but by a small margin. I read something about the treble being fixed, but it sounded the same as the original.     After listening to it in it's entirety I began reading the booklet. It has a lot of rare pictures of the band (and yes, it still includes the infamous photo of the band on the inlay), and includes two essays. The first is by the genius himself, Tom Scholz, talking about how all this almost never happened and process of putting it all together. The next essay is by David Wild - upon reading the name alone I became infuriated. This guy gets overexcited about everything and makes himself sound like an idiot most of the time (if you have the Fortry Licks collection, you probably catch my drift. He referred to Keith Richards as \\"the Lickmaster General.\\" That's just disgusting.)This guy starts comparing \\"More Than a Feeling\\" to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"    \\"Cobain... did all that with a central riff that had what might be termed a decidedly strong Boston accent. Take another listen to 'More Than a feeling.' Now put on 'Smells like Teen Spirit.' You can't miss it.\\"    The chorus riffs of the two songs are played a little similarly, but \\"MTAF\\" is built better and was well written by an amazing songcrafter, unlike \\"SLTS\\" which has the complete opposite of both.    Anyways, if you don't have this, you need it. However, if you already have the original release, it would probably be up to you whether or not to upgrade. I'd intially say no, but due to the value of an album like this you should just do it, especially if you're a big fan like me. The sound's not bad at all, just not a colossal improvement over the original.
0345440900|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tracy's Eat-Activity-Sleep cycle. It helps you anticipate your baby's needs. How do you know if your baby is hungry, tired, just wants to suck...or maybe something else is wrong? EASY takes away a lot of the guesswork. <br /> <br />I struggled with my first child. I was attachment parenting and afraid that anything other than demand feeding and co-sleeping must be on the other side of the AP/cry-it-out dichotomy and therefore cruel, unnatural and potentially harmful to baby's psyche. But it's not all black and white (I know a lot of people could have figured that out on their own but I guess not me). My first son had to be nursed to sleep and would wake up if I tried to get out of bed. My second son goes to bed beautifully in his bassinet after a nurse-bath-lullaby routine. When he wakes up for his nighttime feed I just take him into bed with me. He naps well also. I cannot describe how great it is to be able to shower daily and take care of my older son and get my work done (I work at home). <br /> <br />The methods in this book really helped inspire my parenting strategy and keep me from feeling bad about not embracing every aspect of attachment parenting. I am much more whole and sane than I feel I would have been otherwise. <br /> <br />That said, there is some advice in here that I passed over completely, like not to co-sleep. I also feel that the \\"5 types of babies\\" thing is silly armchair psychology. And she says stuff like \\"babies like to look at lines because they look like they are moving\\" - I doubt there is any proof for that. But overall, it is a great book to have in your parenting toolbox - not a replacement for your own instincts!

B000E97X66|5.0|1.  Buy this album...NOW <br />2.  Do not look at the track listing. <br />3.  Put the album on you stereo. <br />4.  Raise volume to max. <br />5.  Sit (if you can) and enjoy. <br /> <br />Listening to this album as it was performed 30 years ago will make you never want to listen to anything else ever again.  Every record you have ever heard will sound cheap compared to this.  Any band that has ever performed, whether they know it or not, was trying to sound like this.  Songs that are now classics sound new and fresh on this recording.  Listening to this concert will make you happy you are alive.  No joke.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|A great sequel.. although the 1st Underworld is the best.. this was not a dissapointment!
B000FVQYYK|1.0|As a BIG Muse fan, I couldn't wait for this disc to come out in the US.  I even ordered it wihout having heard a single note from it.  Unfortunately, I was immensly disappointed.  This album is as completely different from Absolution and previous efforts as you can get.  But it's not a good difference.  There is one, count 'em ONE song on this disc that I'll call Muse-worthy, that being City of Delusion.  The rest of the disc is just a god-awful mess, that does not even sound like the same band.   <br /> <br />Most of the songs sound like depeche mode dance tunes, except for the dreadful \\"knights of cydonia\\" which, I swear, sounds like Europe.  Remember Europe? - \\"The Final Countdown?\\"  Yeah, there's a reason it went away. <br /> <br />Damn it, Bellamy - I want my favorite band back!
B00000IQC8|1.0|Some reviews... <br /> <br />\\"The funniest movie of the year\\"--New York Newsday <br /> <br />(Must have been a bad year for comedies.) <br /> <br />\\"Screamingly Funny!\\"--Rolling Stone <br /> <br />(Screamingly bad is more like it.) <br /> <br />\\"Two thumbs up!\\"--Siskel and Ebert <br /> <br />(With the eight other fingers down.) <br /> <br />Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!  The dialogue is as stimulating as the U.S. Tax Code, and the actors are as animated as John Kerry on downers.  It would take too long to list this film's bad points.  Just watch five minutes and you'll completely understand why it would be a waste of 87 minutes of your life to watch the rest. <br /> <br />But I would have to say that having Jay in this movie was the clearest indicator of how moronic this film would be.  (Nothing against Silent Bob.  He was about the only interesting highlight of this calamity.) <br />
B00000IPAX|5.0|I remember ripping open the plastic on the album and going to heaven...seriously, this CD is that sweet.  Yes, everyone has heard of Blink thanks to the likes of 'What's My Age Again' and of course the outragous video...but this album is so much more than just three naked guys and a hot nurse.  Yes, 'All The Small Things' and even the downer 'Adam's Song', which tackles the before-thoughts of suicide, are great songs to reference when speaking of Blinks talent, but this album has real gems admists all the radio hits.  Take for example the blistering opener 'Dumpweed' which is one killer way to start off the album, or the horndog brilliance of 'Mutt' which is probably the best track here.  And there's the happy-go-lucky feel to 'Going Away to College' and 'Dysentery Gary' and of course the amply titled 'The Party Song'...and then there's 'Aliens Exist'...I just love that song!  Anyways, hands down one of their best all around CD's, strong throughout and completly entertaining!!!
0060578793|5.0|I just finished writing a review of \\"The Complete Wilderness Training Book\\" and had recommended Lofty Wiseman's book, but then I realized that I hadn't reviewed that book. Since it is one of my favorite books on the subject, let me now correct that oversight.   I just counted the outdoor skills books in my personal library-138. About half deal with survival. Lofty Wiseman's book is the best general survival book I've found. Being the survival instructor for the SAS is serious cred. SpecOps soldiers, along with military pilots and professional explorers, are right at the top of the list of people who are very likely to need advanced survival skills. This book is extremely down to earth and realistic.  A broad range of subjects covered here, and plenty of detail on each subject. If I had to go and live off the land with only 5 minutes' notice, this is the book I'd grab if I had to choose just one.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|I like Rhianna as a person i think that she is beautiful on the inside and out. However i did expect more from her album.Maybe i need to listen to it more. I must admit it does take time for me to like a song. However I wish her well.
B000001DYD|4.0|Eh, angry chick rawk usually isn't my realm, but PJ Harvey has more than what it takes to stand out in such an inconsistent genre. And Rid Of Me is probably the favorite of the PJ albums I've heard so far (hey, it's produced by Steve Albini--were you expecting it to suck? C'mon now).<br /><br />Numbered lists rule, so here I go:<br /><br />1. PJ can actually SING. She doesn't do the obnoxious talk-grunt thing like Kim Gordon or screech like that harridan from Bikini Kill, but nor is she precious or wispy (not that I don't like that on occassion). Her bluesy, grittier intonation can pull off both soulful singing and a gutsy wail, often on the same song, without being overwrought or shrill.<br /><br />2. PJ does sing about relationships on a rather personal level, true, but it's rarely offputting or loaded with embarrassing lyrics like most of her peers (*cough*Tori Amos*cough*). She can be credibly seen as a storyteller looking through the eyes of a character rather than some clumsy wielder of feminist agitprop. And she is at her best here--raw, energetic, powerful, credibly angry where other female artists only irritate.<br /><br />3. She effing ROCKS. Listen to the awesome, rockabilly-esque riffs that open 50 ft. Queenie or the caustic assault of Snake and tell me PJ can't wield a six-string like nobody's business. And while her songs feel off-the-cuff and unrehearsed, there are enough little compositional tricks (violins, the occassional odd time signature) to keep you engaged in the long term.<br /><br />Alright, enough. Highlights include the quiet-to-loud roar of the title track, the beautiful Missed, both versions of Man Sized (one a rocked-out version, the other an eerie atonal string sextet backing PJ's frantic vocals), the grinding blues of Hook, and an able cover of Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited. Fans of early 90's alternative will devour this album. Too bad PJ made quieter and slighty less interesting albums after this one.

0440180295|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five is not what I expected it to be... then again, in the first chapter, the author tells the readers exactly what to expect. Or at least an idea but even after being told the first and last sentence or two and the climax I wasn't prepared for what I got. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Nothing happens. Let me correct that: people die, Billy Pilgrim (the main character) is abducted by aliens, he is part of the most horrendous bombing that took place in the second world war, and he becomes a common image on the TV. But none of it matters because none of it ever takes any precedence. A climax is impossible, a beginning and end are impossible for that matter. This book does not start or finish it is endless and rambling. <br /> <br />Kurt Vonnegut is writing of Billy Pilgrim, a man that has become \\"unstuck in time\\". This means that he travels to the future and the past, although that statement isn't entirely correct. All moments coexist universally, thus there is no possibility for a future and a past. The problem is describing the book means to enter into the book's world, which is impossible if you don't know what that world is: paradox.  <br /> <br />The book supplied me with a lot of thought. My mind was always screwing itself up in reading it. The book makes you trip over the guidelines you lay out to understand it. I realize that much more powerfully in describing it now. The peculiarity and tendency to perplex however does not make it a bad book, it's very good on the other hand. <br /> <br />Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five brought up interesting issues although what it brought up is not what it's famous for in my opinion. They say it's an anti-war novel but I would say it's more like an anti-human mind novel. Oddly enough it says to us that humanity has no control whatsoever over what happens but it also says that there is nothing else that is in control but just what exists. What exists is there and is unalterable. Everything is laid out carefully, a perfect law that appears to be extreme chaos.  <br /> <br />I don't necessarily agree with all that Kurt Vonnegut brings up in this famous novel but I do admit that I enjoyed the book for bringing these things up. I felt a new perspective stated clearly and without baggage. I could read this book without applying a philosophical label to it. All in all Slaughterhouse Five is a good discussion novel. It's great for its themes and the conversation that I'm sure will come out of it. The book though well written has very little to it without its ideas though. I would suggest it but only if you leave time for discussion and debate afterwards.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|1979 saw the year off \\"The Wall\\", a highly anticipated album by Pink Floyd, on that album say the number 1 smash hit, \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\", also came which was voted the best guitar solo, \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (check the solo at the end off this song, it will blow your head of) at the time everyone was disapointed with it saying it was to long, because at the time it was a 2 both sided vinyls, in other words 4 cds, I personally loved it. Everyone at the time said it was to long, I was there I remember the critics. <br />2006 brings \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", an excellant underated Red Hot Chili Peppers album with two hits, \\"Dani California\\" and \\"Tell Me Baby\\", with more great singles coming soon. Everyone says this album is too long, believe me in 27 years time, you will east thoughs word and miss the days when \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", was popular. <br />The best songs in my opinion has to be, \\"Make You Feel Better\\", \\"Animal Bar\\", \\"If\\", \\"Strip My Mind\\", \\"Wet Sand\\", \\"Slow Cheetah\\", \\"Especially In Michigan\\", \\"Charlie\\", \\"Hump De Bump\\", \\"Desecration Smile\\", \\"Readymade\\". <br />Good album definately worth getting.
0553801503|4.0|When this novel came out, I think some folks started to think that Martin might be catching the same bug that struck Robert Jordan.  That being the inability to keep his mass of characters and plotlines in check, which eventually leads to the plot grinding to a halt.  Myself, I don't think this is the case.  Sure, less happens in a Feast for Crows than in the previous novels and some of our favorite characters are absent, but the plot is far,far,far from stagnant.  The root of people's discontent is that the last three books were so pants-wettingly good that Feast sort of killed their euphoria.  By no means is this a bad novel, it is simply not as good as the last entries into the series. <br /> <br />  The are two reasons why I decided on a four star rating for Feast.  One, several of the POV's (cough-Brienne-cough-Samwell-cough) do pretty much suck.  You just don't come to like either of them very well as characters and they do very little.  Two, the agonizing psuedo-cliffhangers.  Martin leaves us on the edge of what will be some pretty world-changing events and it just...hurts.  As for what enraged the majority of his readers, that being the absence of so many POV's, well, it made me angry at first.  Then I read through Jaime's chapters.  And I through Arya's few appearances.  And then I read through the one-time POV's set in Dorne.  And it was good.  His characters are still as deep and incredible as ever.  Prince Doran is a testament to that. <br /> <br />  In closing, I say that while Feast suffers when compared to its older brothers, it is still the best fantasy has to offer.  Whether it be in prose, characterization, world-building, or plot, Martin is still king.  But, dear God, I hope he moves a little faster with A Dance with Dragons.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I first heard of a television show called 'Veronica Mars' in an interview with Joss Whedon in which he declared it his favourite t.v. show.  Anything that Joss Whedon the master of great televison, gets excited about is surely worth checking out.  Over here in England Veronica Mars is not that well known.  It should be because it is a consistently brilliant series.   <br />   Veronica Mars is a really cool show with lots of great dialogue, some awesome twists in the overall narrative arch and a lead heroine who is just an absolute hottie.  The only quibble I have with the show, and its a problem I have with most American television shows, is the fact that all the High School kids look at least 25 years old.  It's a shame because suspension of disbelief is quite hard.  Veronica herself barely passes the test, but I'll let it go for the sake of a good story and some awesome dialogue.   <br />   The first season sees Veronica trying to find out who killed her best friend Lily Kane.  There's tonnes of other stuff in there too, from High School cults to teachers accused of sexual misconduct.  There are some cool cameos from the likes of Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein, but come on...Paris Hilton, that was another low point in an otherwise great show.  I would highly recommend Veronica Mars because it has the potential to be a classic series.

0451191153|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Everyone should read this book, not because the philosophy it espouses will be one that will have unanimous consent; not because the story is realistic or plausible; not for any of the wrong reasons, or even for any of the right reasons. For example, this book is an extremely fast-paced read that manages to suck you in within the first 50 pages and not let go of you until the very end. This book is also interesting and worthy of thought. However, this book's greatest merit, and if this were its only merit, then it would suffice to make the book great just by it being there, is that this book will change you. <br /> <br />After reading Ayn Rand, you will see things differently. You might not become a Howard Roark or a John Galt. You might not even become one of the lesser, but still virtuous characters. You might even have nothing but contempt for all of these supposedly virtuous characters who design their lives around self actualization through egotism and selfishness. But, you will see the world differently. You will suddenly see these traits of people. You will make comparisons. You will ask yourself the question \\"What would Ayn Rand think?\\" That is just how the book is written. It is written to create an indelible impression on every reader.  <br /> <br />I know this, (Actually, I think that Ayn Rand uses this expression constantly in her book.) because my life was changed by this book. Not only because I neglected to do a lot of things because I would rather have read another chapter of this long book, but in the sense that my current ideology is shaped by the philosophy that she espouses. I don't necessarilly agree with all of the precepts, but I certainly sympathize with many of the more overarching ideals.  <br /> <br />Sure, after reading this book you might become a jerk. Many people do, but at least as a jerk, you will be one that is somewhat well read. Any maybe, you will become quite the opposite, just to spite objectivism, but that's not too bad either. <br /> <br />In this way, the book is a work of art. It is guarenteed to create an impression of some sort and afterall, I am dubious that  this could be said about every book, or even most books. In this way, Ayn Rand is more than a self-obbsessed philosopher, but a legitimate artist, whose works should be read by everyone who thinks. Yes, even if you are a liberal or a communist or a christian or even a Muslim.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I own the Firefly DVD series, bought on a whim due to an overzealous friend's recommendation. It was OK for TV, but not spectacular; given the choice, I prefer Law and Order reruns. So, no complaint about Firefly other than it wasn't for me. But Serenity, on the other hand, other than the explosions simply wasn't big screen material. The plot is laughable. Teenage psi chick goes berserk, showing herself as part of a central government plot to create an uber weapon out of a 100 pound stick with breasts. She kills a bunch of baddies and, by the end, everything is A-OK. What a surprise.   <br /> <br />Is it any wonder why this flick flopped? It's less original than popsicles on a stick. Perhaps Whedon could arrange to merge his two pet projects, Buffy and Firefly, into one supershow: Firefly, the Vampire Slaying Space Ship, with Gina Tores as Commander Big Boobs and Sarah Michele Geller as Ms. Woody Staked.   <br /> <br />Sheesh.  <br /> <br />Perhaps it's worth a rent for those interested in Firefly. Otherwise, if you're just coming to the series and movie, I'd say, don't waste your time.

0393327345|2.0|I loved the movie, but the book... meh.  Didn't blow me away.  I keep hearing about how much more awesome it is than the screen adaptation, but I just found it to be a little too boring.  Besides, the author said in an interview that he liked the movie's ending over his own.  HINT:  It's never good when the author prefers the movie.
0553103547|5.0|This first book in 'A Song of Ice and Fire' is titled 'A Game of Thrones', but really the entire seven-book Song is just that: a game of thrones. The story basically tells of the power struggles of the noble houses of Martin's fictional world, and it is one of the most powerful, gripping stories I have ever read.<br /><br />Martin's prose is masterful, his world is brilliantly created, his characters are amazingly complex and the plotline is so intricately woven, with so many complex subplots and so many unpredictable twists and turns, that it is nearly impossible to predict what comes next - the story never goes the way the reader expects it to. This lack of fantasy cliches, cheesy endings and perfect heroes was such a wonderful relief to me.<br /><br />But a warning: If you are very young and/or have not started the fantasy genre yet, this book is not for you...yet. Martin's Song is harsh, unyielding and extremely realistic, and some find the graphic violence, horror and sex in his books disturbing. I think that his unflinching depiction of these things is brave, and it helps to accurately portray the real horror of what the characters face - if he glossed these things over, it wouldn't have the same effect. Martin is never really too excessive with this - he does what he needs to do to tell the story properly. But I repeat, young children should not read these books until they've been introduced to other fantasy series. And anyone new to the genre would do well to do the same.<br /><br />All in all, I'm amazed with Martin's skill as a writer. There are few books which have affected me so much, and which I have gotten so involved in emotionally. I recommend 'A Song of Ice and Fire' highly. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that George R. R. Martin is one of the greatest writers of our time. Fantasy readers - he's as brilliant as Rowling and Tolkien. Maybe more so. That should tell you something, eh?
0812968255|5.0|this is the finest translation of marcus aurelius's meditations that i have read. previous translations i have read were loaded with so many thee's and thou's that the reading was tedious and slow. i found my self scanning the pages instead of reading until i would come across an obvious jem. this made me oblivious to the hidden jems that make up this excellent work.  this book gives the emperor's words a modern flair that doesn't lose the original flavor. i highly recommend it.

0743487486|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for parents who want to move away from parenting children who are simply obedient  and \\"apparently\\" no trouble.  Because the world has changed, and the family context is very different from that in which most parents were brought up, it is extremely important to help them develop strong resilient families where children learn emotional competence as well as how they belong and care in their relationships- skills they will need for life in the world of 21C.  This book offers well researched strategies for achieving these goals and helping parents find a credible way to cope with the changes they face.

B000BB1MIC|4.0|Well, I can honestly say that so far, the fifth season is turning out rather refreshing. There is a sudden thrust of comedy in the writing, an air of change on the horizon for the characters, and most importantly; some very out-of-character behavior going on. <br /> <br />I personally felt that the third and fourth seasons had ruined all hope for the show (in my eyes at least), as they were quite clearly less enjoyable from a male's perspective, and quite a bit more \\"girly\\".  <br /> <br />I haven't finished the fifth season yet, but from what I can see, things are looking up for the comedic value of this Warner Brothers \\"classic-in-the-making\\".
B000002IOJ|5.0|This has got to be the best Testament album! This band ranks up there with Slayer. Hardcore thrash and yet the melodic subtleties blow your mind away during the slow song \\"The Ballad\\". The lead singer Chuck has an awesome voice and if you've ever seen them in concert he bangs his head NON-STOP! My personal favorites on this album are \\"Sins Of Omission\\" and \\"Nightmare(Coming Back To You)\\". There's some really cool hardcore bass goin on in \\"Confusion Fusion\\". Every single song on this album rocks. You can listen to this album from start to finish without wanting to skip any songs. In other words...go buy this album NOW!!! And then buy some of their other albums. <br />NOW!!! <br />

B000EHRVP6|1.0|Why? That is the question any intelligent person will be asking themselves after they watch this piece of garbage. Why did they make this movie? It is utterly pointless, devoid of entertainment, joyless, and nihilistic. At least \\"Saw\\", which this movie is clearly formatted after, had some virtues. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies. The story is stupid in so many ways that I cannot even bring myself to describe it. The characters evoke no sympathy and are bland and unlikeable. I write this review to warn potential buyers of this movie that you can't get that two hours of your life back if you watch this movie. If you have read this far you can't say that you haven't been warned.
B000EULJLU|4.0|It's good music, but damn, is it evil. I'm talkin' 'bout Cannibal Corpse-type evil. If you're Christian, stay away from this album, just listen to it like... 5 times... but that's it. No more than that! It's evil.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I heard \\"Revolution\\" on the radio a year ago and I thought, \\"oh no...this is it? This is the long awaited reunion? This is horrible!\\" Then recently I saw the recent tour on video and it was full of energy so I listened to \\"Angels of Retribution\\" and I was really surprised. The songwriting is decent, a lot better than some of their past albums. There's an edge, Rob sounds great and some songs really kick a--. The majority of the songs are short, there aren't any complex diversions or progressions or long searing guitar solos or double solos. But it doesn't matter, it's in your face. I like this better than Rob with his own band. The mix is absolutely excellent: it's balanced and you can hear everything. It sounds great really loud in the car. I'm glad I picked it up! Not bad for guys who have been around 35 years.

B000002J2F|5.0|THE BAND: Mike Rutherford (electric guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals), Phil Collins (lead vocals, drums & percussion), Tony Banks (keyboards, 12 string guitar, backing vocals).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1980) 12 songs clocking in at just over 55 minutes. Originally released 3/31/80, this \\"definitive\\" remastered edition released in October 1994 (no bonus tracks). Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, production crew, and a center page listing all albums and album covers released between 1970 and 1993. Recorded at Polar Studios, Stockholm, Sweden. Album cover artwork by Lionel Koechlin. Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This was my favorite Genesis album of the entire 1980's. To say the least, it was a transitional album. Leaving behind the progressive mark of Peter Gabriel in the early to mid 70's, and truly entering the dominating Phil Collins era of pop and rock. The sound is BIG - especially Collins' drumming (even if some/all is done on a drum machine). I like \\"Duke\\" because it's more rock at this point than pop. I also like the song structure in perhaps the 3 best songs here... there's a long 2 or 3 minute jam before the vocals come in (\\"Behind The Lines\\", \\"Duchess\\", and the 8+ minute \\"Duke's Travel's\\"). \\"Duke\\" hit #1 on the UK chart and eventually hit #11 in America. The biggest hit to come from \\"Duke\\" was Phil Collins' \\"Misunderstanding\\" (reaching #14 on the U.S. charts). Seems like a lot of people trash this song for it's dull \\"pop\\" feel... however, I think it's still catchy after 2 decades of being overplayed on the FM airwaves. Other charting hits included \\"Duchess\\" (#46 in UK) and \\"Turn It On Again\\" (#8 in UK, #58 in U.S.). An underrated gem is Tony Banks' \\"Heathhaze\\"... as well as Collins' sad \\"Please Don't Ask\\". I still have the ticket stub from an incredible concert at Madison Square Garden (NYC) on June 29, 1980 where Genesis played so many songs from this album - Genesis was always tremendous live. Still a classic album in my book (4.5 stars).c album in my book (4.5 stars).
B00004TJKI|5.0|Using a popular novel by an actual attorney, director Otto Preminger pushed the bounds of 1959 American movie censorship by directing and producing one of the most frank, hard-hitting, and engrossing films of the 1950's.  It was certainly the most adult film that James Stewart had made up to that time and, given his preference for \\"family films\\" in later years, this may have been the most shocking film of his career.  Its honesty and innovations are such that it remains remarkably realstic and relevant today. <br /> <br />Filmed mostly on location in and around Marquette, Michigan (on the picturesque Upper Peninsula, near Lake Superior), \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" has few dull moments, if any.  It is certainly one of the most accurate, authentic courtroom dramas ever filmed, especially since the judge is played by the legendary attorney Joseph Welch, who had presided over the Army-McCarthy Senate hearings of 1954.  Welch is absolutely delightful and fascinating to watch, a true natural in his portrayal of a \\"country judge.\\" <br /> <br />James Stewart is the defense attorney in the story, defending Ben Gazzara's character, who is accused of murdering the man who allegedly raped his wife (played by the sexy and beautiful Lee Remick).  He matches wits with a prosecuting attorney played by George C. Scott in one his earliest major roles.  The legal sparring between the two attorneys, sometimes including a local prosecutor, makes for great drama. <br /> <br />Stewart is aided by a crusty, alcholic, older attorney played by veteran actor Arthur O'Connell, and his wise-cracking, sarcastic secretary, played by Eve Arden, who was then best known for her work on the long-running \\"Our Miss Brooks\\" television series. <br /> <br />As Stewart does some investigation of the case, he visits an inn that is run by Kathyrn Grant, who was actually Kathryn Crosby in real life.  He eventually learns an amazing secret from Miss Grant. <br /> <br />Adding to the delight of the film is an encounter with the one-and-only jazz musician Duke Ellington, who also composed the syncopated, magical music for the production.  Stewart was a gifted amateur musician and, when he sits down at the piano with Ellington, there is a special, quite enjoyable treat. <br /> <br />Otto Preminger continually strived for greater originality and innovation in his films.  Known for his autocratic direction, Preminger nevertheless sought to make more realstic films as he battled with those who wanted to keep Hollywood within strict moral bounds. <br /> <br />Preminger obviously recognized that Hollywood needed to tell the truth, even if it might be unpleasant or disturbing.  Perhaps the presence of James Stewart helped to make the mention of women's underwear and even rape more palatable during the trial in this rather controversial film.  It may be hard for younger viewers to imagine that this film was quite incredible for 1959, especially in America; only the French and Italian filmmakers were able to go farther during the 1950's.  Perhaps things have gone too far in recent years, but this film is clearly honest and realistic. <br /> <br />The stark black and white photography adds to the atmosphere of the Upper Peninsula location filming, particularly in the scenes in the woods, around the lake, and even the towns.  Overall, this remains a very entertaining and fascinating film.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Live Scenes From New York (LSFNY)is Dream Theater's third live release (following 1993's Live at the Marquee and 1998's Once in a LIVETime) and is 3CDs and 4 hours of prog greatness, captured on one of those rare nights when legendary bands are at the height of their powers (sort of like The Who's Live at Leeds, Rush's Exit...Stage Left, and Hendrix's Band of Gypsys).  LSFNY was recorded on the last date of DT's Metropolis 2000 Tour at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City.  The original pressings of the CD (of which I have one) had a flaming apple (based on their flaming heart logo) with the New York skyline (and the Twin Towers) visible...and was released on September 11, 2001 (being a tuesday, when all new CDs are released in America).  The CD was recalled and reissued with new artwork, so the burning apple covers are rather rare.  That being said, enough of this boring stuff...ON TO THE MUSIC!!! <br /> <br />The first disc and a half consists of DT performing their 1999 masterpiece of an album, Scenes From a Memory, in its entirety.  And it is simply stunning to hear them pull it off live.  Additionally, the live presentation adds to the music, with extended sections, improvs, and guest star Theresa Thomason (who sang on the album) and a gospel choir.  Truly fantastic stuff, from the soaring Overture 1928/Strange Deja Vu to the solo trade-offs at the end of Fatal Tragedy, the sweeping Beyond This Life, the poignant Through Her Eyes, all the way to the absolutely majestic sing-along The Spirit Carries On.  And how can I forget the technical wizardry of the four instrumentalists contained in Home and The Dance of Eternity, one of the most complex instrumentals EVER!  Through it all, singer James LaBrie sounds fantastic. <br /> <br />The second set is started off by an excellent rendition of Metropolis Part 1, and they just move from strength to srength with the material....Just Let Me Breathe, Caught in a New Millennium (a mash-up of two of their songs, Caught Ina Web and New Millennium), even throwing Liquid Tension Experiment's Acid Rain (the side project of keyboardist Jordan Rudess, drummer Mike Portnoy, and guitarist John Petrucci).  The third disc has the only released live rendition of the entire Mind Beside Itself trilogy (Erotomania, Voices, and the Silent Man), which is excellent, especially the full-band Silent Man.  After a marathon Learning to Live, the band returns for the encore to top all encores...the ENTIRE 24-minute A Change of Seasons, which is simply stunning.  After the 4 hour show, James LaBrie apologizes for the \\"short set\\".....quite the joker, he is.  This is also the show where Mike Portnoy collapsed afterwards and spent two hours under blankets recuperating from exhaustion and dehydration! <br /> <br />I have all of DT's live albums and while all excellent, this one is the king of them all (Score isn't out yet, it comes out in a month...that one may top this, who knows?).  While anyone new to DT should seek out all of their studio albums (starting with Images and Words) before embarking upon listening to the live ones, they are completely worth purchasing.  And this one is simply stunning.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is possibly the finest western tale ever made;  perfectly produced, directed, and cast perfectly.   I did not want it to end.  My only regret is that the sequel, Return to Lonesome Dove, did not have the original cast.  Lonesome Dove was perfect in every respect!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly.  What can i say?  It's the best tv show ever made!  Who knows why it was cancelled, but everyone i have ever showed it to has loved every minute of it.  This is a must have, if not just to support the series, since there's a rumor they are going to make a second season.  If it was put back on tv, i bet it would have a much greater viewing population because all it needed was a little publicity, which it has definitely gotten.  I have never met a single soul who didn't like firefly, even those people who hate sci fi and westerns, there is something about mal, jayne, inara, zoe, wash, kaylee, simon, river, and shepherd that make it amazing... it is constant fun, and you won't forget buying it.  ever.
B000069AUI|5.0|First, quit with the comparisons. \\"They're just Radiohead!\\" If they were just Radiohead then they'd be Radiohead wouldn't they? Radiohead is Radiohead and Coldplay is Coldplay. Same goes for U2. And I don't like it when people tell others to listen to Radiohead instead of Coldplay. Radiohead are a tad overrated. I like them but somtimes it seems like Thom Yorke has gone \\"Hmmm... I'll just write some random chords and they'll sound good... C#m7add11#5 sounds good... I like complicated chords.\\" an example of this is Just on The Bends, that guitar chord progression is just random and stupid.  <br />Now to A Rush of Blood to the Head. I'm a new Coldplay fan. I used to dispise them. I don't know why but I think it had something to with Clocks being used for the Peter Pan trailers and I hated the kid who played Peter Pan... That was probably it. But then, just last year I was looking for music that was... Beautiful, shimmering. I reluctantly put this album on iTunes but I didn't listen to it. Then one day whilst listening on shuffle In My Place came on... It was the one that got me... It was just so pretty. The chord progression, the riff, it just works. After that I got all their albums and I think I like almost every single one of their songs. <br />People also tend to say that this album (and Coldplay in general) are depressing but I think that they, inside, are depressed and are trying to find something easy to blame their problems on. This music isn't depressing, I haven't ever felt the need to kill myself whilst listening to Coldplay. Also I think that people always mistake melancholy for depression. <br />This album will be a favourite for mine for a long time I think, and I just feel sorry for the people that hate Coldplay but instead like to hear a guitar being shredded and distorted and people singing about drugs, death and sex, because they're missing out.
6305841861|5.0|Did I say scary? Yeah, this movie is a little scary, not too much though. But it's more frightening than most of today's \\"scary\\" movies. It's also much more enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Bruce Campbell is the ultimate b-movie actor. He has the greatest facial expressions in history. For about 30 minutes during the movie, there are no words, just grunts and facial expressions by Campbell as he's getting attacked by the evil spirits. That part of the movie is great fun. These sequences of Campbell fighting off the spirits show how much of a genius Sam Raimi is. <br /> <br />The sequences with Campbell were so good, it's possible to tolerate the non-Campbell parts of the movie.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie. It is perfect for those nights when friends are visiting and you are all debating what to watch. Chances are they wouldn't have seen this movie and if they did, they'll be excited to know you have it.
B000002HMH|4.0|I remember the first time I had listened to LOAD and just threw the booklet I was reading after listening to the very first song. I guess it would have been a shock to everyone who would have got so used to their old thrashier stuff that something close to rock becomes unacceptable. It was the case with me too; I refused to listen to the album whole heartedly and branded them as sell-outs. But one day I took the album and decided to give it one good listen. It did not sound bad, then another. As you spend more time with the cd it slowly seeps through.  <br /> <br />We ought to be more acceptable to change... I guess. This is definitely a must buy for all Metallica and for all those who love hard rock. The guitar riffs in this one are not the fast furious, heavy ones. They are slow and unhurried (unlike Megadeth), yet they somehow make you feel like you are listening to a heavy album. May be its due to the good rhythm maintained throughout the album. \\"Mama Said\\" is another track that is unlike anything Metallica has played. I really love it. \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"Outlaw Torn\\" are those long heavy tracks which are dominated by vocals and a very catchy solo towards the end.  <br />I'll just review those tracks that are not so famous but which I thought are pretty good. <br />There is \\"Ronnie\\" that is a cross between country and rock. \\"Cure\\" is a short, fast and hard rocking track. \\"Ain't My Bi***\\" and \\"2x4\\" can be grouped together, these are the medium length songs with a really solo.  <br /> <br />Verdict: A definite must buy. But be sure that you won't get to listen to any \\"seek and destroy\\" (actually a personal fav.) kind of songs. Just be open and then you'll enjoy it. <br />Also try listening to it all in a single stretch. <br /> <br />
B000F39MAQ|5.0|With some reservations, I enjoyed the two-disc CD recording of this fulsome performance of Verdi's \\"La Traviata\\" released late last year. Under the direction of Carlo Rizzi leading the Wiener Philharmoniker (Vienna Philharmonic), the classic opera represents a prime opportunity to intertwine grand romantic melodrama with many of the composer's most famous arias and duets. Even though there are choruses and set pieces, it is really more a chamber opera, and you need three powerfully sculpted voices to make this a momentous occasion. Removing the visual element, the performance feels variable in spots despite the immense talent involved.<br /><br />However, now that I can see and appreciate director Willi Decker's spare, modernist staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival on this 2006 Deluxe Edition DVD package, the opera becomes a more emotionally transcendent experience. He takes the passing of time as his primary leitmotif in the form of a gigantic clock with Death taking an ever-present human form. The costuming is stylishly modern-dress, while the few color-coordinated set pieces would look appropriate in an Upper West Side art gallery. Based on Alexandre Dumas's play, \\"The Lady of the Camellias\\", the opera's tragic love story is the same in this adaptation, but the overall attitude reflects a greater sense of liberation with the period melodrama mostly excised. Purists will be offended, especially those married to the Callas or more recent Angela Gheorghiu versions.<br /><br />As the passionate Violetta Val&eacute;ry, Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is an inarguably stunning woman made for the camera. Less the courtesan of the classic version and more a hedonistic party girl (like a more melancholy Holly Golightly), parading in her deep red cocktail dress, she convincingly performs the role with alternating waves of gusto and poignancy. Vocally, Netrebko complements her fiery presence with an impressive performance that gives way to equal parts great passion and deep love once she discovers renewed life with her lover Alfredo. Offering shimmering roulades, she nails her much anticipated Act I climax, \\"E stano...Ah, fors'&egrave; lui...Sempre libera\\", and maximizes her lower register in her burnished handling of the final aria, \\"Gran dio! Morir si giovane!\\". Her less-than-perfect Italianate diction is not as problematic here as it is on CD when we are robbed of her beauty.<br /><br />Given the dominance of Violetta, Mexican tenor Rolando Villaz&oacute;n more than holds his own with Netrebko as the smitten Alfredo. In fact, he is a better actor than she in displaying his character's tentative nature at the beginning, followed in turn by his swooning romanticism, seething anger and broken-hearted resignation. Displaying an exceptionally agile voice and an almost improvisational-sounding style in his phrasing and inflections, he brings his arsenal of skills together most effectively in his Act II opening, \\"Lunge de lei... De' miei bollenti spiriti...O mio rimorso\\". In this scene, Alfredo and Violetta prance around in persistent afterglow in their floral bathrobes on a matching floral sofa.<br /><br />In fact, there is a great deal of physicality in the production to make the sexual tension reverberate, and the party-loving, black-suited chorus is equally as animated. All the while, Netrebko and Villaz&oacute;n generate true chemistry while blending seamlessly in their duets. American baritone Thomas Hampson comes across much better on the DVD than the CD, where he is recognizably the weak link. Looking more engaged onstage, he brings the appropriate emotional fervor to his confrontation scenes with Violetta and sounds effectively resolute in his ending aria in Act II, \\"Di provenza il mar, il suol\\". The death scene still seems too elongated for the drama preceding it, and Rizzi does not help with his lugubrious pacing at this juncture.<br /><br />The entire opera is on the first disc of the 2006 two-DVD set, and it is blessedly captured with clarity both visually and aurally. The second disc contains a number of extras, the most important being a 45-minute behind-the-scenes featurette chronicling the painstaking preparation of the production. Netrebko and an especially precocious Villaz&oacute;n are interviewed throughout. Villaz&oacute;n also does a three-minute introduction of the opera in German, obviously done for its TV airing. There is an automatic slide show of photos from the production set to the \\"Brindisi\\", a Netrebko discography, and lastly, a ten-minute highlights segment of Netrebko's rather self-aggrandizing video collection, \\"The Woman...The Voice\\".ains a number of extras, the most important being a 45-minute behind-the-scenes featurette chronicling the painstaking preparation of the production.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|Overall this is a good quality recording (it is a Broadway show, after all - what else would you expect).  There are a few parts where the characters are speaking rather than singing, and those are hard to hear.  But in general if you loved the show (and I did!) this is a very enjoyable CD.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Originally released in 1973 as a live triple album, this excellent 2-disc offering from Yes features mostly songs from Close to the Edge and Fragile, with some others from The Yes Album and keyboardist Rick Wakeman's solo effort, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. All sound as clear as if they were recorded recently, even though these performances are from the early seventies.  The quality of the recording and precision of the music is just what we have come to expect from Yes. It doesn't sound dated at all and the performance is inspired. This stuff rocks! The live version of Heart Of The Sunrise on Yessongs sounds even better than the also great studio version found on Fragile. Yessongs is a great collection of live music from the classic Yes years.<br />Highly recommended.
B000002LCI|5.0|\\"Music for the Masses\\" marks Depeche Mode's true emergence as a full-fledged musical force.  For awhile in the 80's it seemed like simply everyone with a synthesizer was cutting an album.  But what makes Depeche different from, say, Howard Jones, was their ability to grow beyond their synthpop roots and expand their sound, as witnessed by \\"Masses\\" and its richer textures, deeper songs, and a new direction would would continue on the other great Depeche Mode album, \\"Violator\\".<br /><br />I am especially fond of such unusual tracks as the Aggro remix of the album's opening track; a very different interpretation of essentially the same song, both more hard driving and darker.  This remix still stands as one of my most favorite 'hard' electronic songs of all time, and convinced more than a few of my hair metal buddies that Depeche Mode was absolutely NOT \\"sissy music\\".<br /><br />\\"Music for the Masses\\" functioned as my personal soundtrack for much of the summer of 1989, and if I had to finger any single Depeche Mode album as being \\"The\\" Depeche Mode album, this would probably be it.
B000E33W1C|5.0|I seen this when it first came out in the theaters and I was laughing so much,tears were running down my face.The great thing about this movie and so many like it,is that it still holds up.It's not dated.Great writing,pacing and directing throughout..Wonderful cast...It's got a little bit of Python thrown in as well...How can you go wrong? You can't! I'm looking forward to the all of the extras,too...This is Cleese's finest hour,since leaving Python and Fawlty Towers....BUY THIS!!!
B000002LK1|5.0|Whereas \\"Music for the Masses\\" was my personal soundtrack for the summer of 1989, Depeche's follow on album \\"Violator\\" was my soundtrack for the summer of 1990.  Neither as long nor as eclectic as \\"Masses\\", Violator still rocked my young world when I popped it into my car stereo in the spring of 1990, and kept me rocking until the first frosts hit in October.<br /><br />As noted in the official review, this album is more \\"dancy\\" than the previous album, but the fully-grown sound of Depeche Mode is in fine form on such classics as \\"Policy of Truth\\" and \\"World in My Eyes\\".  In many ways Depeche Mode's most commercially viable album, \\"Violator\\" in no way sacrifice's Depeche's signature style for mass-market appeal.  Rather, I think \\"Violator\\" was something of a 'perfect storm' album: the right ground with the right combination of songs at the right moment in U.S. and U.K. pop history.<br /><br />No Depeche Mode album since \\"Violator\\" has come close to capturing my attention as this album did.  \\"Ultra\\" being, perhaps, the exception to this rule.  Otherwise, I have found problems with the successive albums that came out in 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005.  If it wasn't production it was composition, if it wasn't composition it was the lyrics.<br /><br />On \\"Violator\\", DM seem to have got it just about perfect.

0064409422|4.0|I loved this book as a child. I remember having it read to me when I was six. Of course, I was oblivious to the Christian theology running through it at the time, and in later books some of the references to other races is questionable. But this first book remains a classic and an innovator. If you enjoyed it try reading Lightsleep by Matthew S. Batham, a new fantasy about a bratty boy who finds himself in another world.
B00005ASOI|4.0|It probably won't terrify you as some other horror films like \\"The Exorcist\\" or \\"Ringu\\" will, but \\"Suspiria\\" is definitely an iconic film that all horror film fans must watch. What make it so effective are the strange atmosphere (i.e., visuals, sounds, etc.) and, of course, the now famous score. It'll easily be one of your favorite films of the genre after seeing it.
078322687X|5.0|There was a jock, a brain, a burnout, a princess, and a basketcase. They came as complete strangers. But they left as soul mates.<br /><br />In this classic story, five teens from different social classes come together for eight hours of secluded Saturday detention at Shermer High. At first, they are all tense and annoyed that they have to be there. But as the hours ware on, they begin to learn more about themselves then they ever knew.<br /><br />Mr. Vernon, an uptight, child-hating principal keeps a close watch on the group from across the hall. Each time he decides to make an entrance, another classic quote is deveoped. \\"Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\\" John Bender, the high school burnout asks him and a sarcastic tone. This movie's scrips is so well written, that in every scene something that will always be remembered is said.<br /><br />This story teaches about learning to accept people who are different from you. Each and every student is strange in their own way, but \\"some are better at hiding it\\", to quote Andy Clark, played by Emilio Estevez. They quickly learn to see past the outside and to bare their souls, and understand each other.<br /><br />If there were more movies out there life The Breakfast Club, I believe children might be more accepting. This movie teaches true moral values, while being funny and dramatic at the same time.<br /><br />My all time favorite movie.

This monograph is very useful in making the book work for an organization that is driven by a different kind of results. The monograph also allows you to get this info without having to buy another copy of Good to Great,so it is well worth the cost for its small size.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Before buying the CD, i only heard their number one single, \\"Helena\\" during the music awards on TV. It sounded okay at first but as i heard the song on the radio, it grew on me and i had to buy it, to hear what kind of music they wrote. My Chamical Romance is a rock, metal, and post hardcore band all in one. THe band technically go started when Gerard started writing songs, calling over buddy Matt Pelissier to help out. Ray hadn't been playing guitar seriously for about three years, but went over there anyway to check things out. He went to pratice in thier attic and ended up bein glbown away by the style of music and writing Gerard had done. It was a real dark, edgy theme, still containing a slight pop element. After a couple of weeks of practicing, there was an obvious energy they felt playing together. Mikey started plaing bass with them, and soon they got Frank a couple of months later to fil out the other guitar spot. He happened to be in another band that had helped them get some of their first shows.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|If you're looking for a fun, well-executed, entertaining to the very end, temporary escape, then Inside Man is your movie. Directed by Spike Lee, in what would seem like a string of films designed to tug at your intelligent side, yet fill your craving for action, Inside Man manages to deliver to the last drop, leaving you with Indian Bollywood music playing in your head. It retains all the elements of a solid caper film, basking in the smarts of the old police caper genre and leaves us with something greater than forced twists and clich? shoot-outs.  <br /> <br />The movie starts out with full confidence in holding the audience's attention. Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) begins by telling us he's devised the perfect bank robbery, and on an average post-9/11 New York afternoon he and his small team walk in to a branch and proceed to hold about 40 people hostage. Enter Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), who maps out the negotiation strategies. Both men are smart, naturally. Suspense, as we've come to expect, evolves from watching and wondering who's outguessing who.  <br /> <br />At the core of Inside Man is a sharp caper/thriller that's well-crafted by Lee and his group of collaborators, including actors Washington, Jodie Foster, Owen, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as well as screenwriter Russell Gewirtz in his ground-breaking debut. This thriller about the perfect bank robbery, wherein both the cops and the robbers are genuinely smart and motivated, yet not superhuman nor without humanity, gets as close to \\"excellent\\" as any similarly concerned Hollywood feature has come in the past decade or so. Inside Man will likely be remembered as one of those better films.  <br /> <br />Hardly anyone in Inside Man has to stretch much--and that's just fine. No one really has to since the parts are tailor made for them. Washington, a long-time Spike Lee favorite, fits right in as the streetwise cop, who doesn't necessarily play by the rules but gets the job done. He and Ejiofor have a nice, easy-going rapport as partners who've been together awhile. Owen plays another calm, collected, no-nonsense guy you empathize with, who can look straight into the camera and tell it like it is. You definitely want him to get away with it. Only Foster steers away a little from her usual intelligent heroines to play someone who is still smart but also very cunning--and a little mean-spirited. It looks like she had a lot of fun doing it, too, in her smart, three-piece suit and subtle smirks. In supporting roles, Dafoe does a nice turn as the befuddled S.W.A.T. leader, while Plummer, as a banker with a shady past, sort of plays the antithesis to his goody too-shoes Captain Von Trapp in Sound of Music.  <br />Inside Man, right up to its very title, is multi-layered on top of it's already many surfaced layers. It's sense of flawed people trying their hardest to do the right thing despite the wrongs they've committed (and may continue to commit) is rich for the very discussion that Lee is prone to provoke. As its post-robbery third act resolves to satisfy all the questions and plot strands for the audience, it raises further eyebrows in testing the ethical resilience of everyone's motives. What was it all for if not just for personal gain? The final scene where Washington stares down the past and his own future in his very hand is a brilliant summation on the lengths we can go to for personal happiness and success. We've come to expect such statements from Spike, but never before in such an entertaining fashion.  <br /> <br />credit for review is to t T squires, Couldn't put it better than him  <br /> <br />Jubril <br />Jubril.com <br />Business Phenom

All the chapters are told from one person's point of view so you get their secrets but not everything is as it seems.  I couldn't put it down.
076781326X|5.0|This is a great film and true in spirit and basic plot to Dickens.  The songs are melodically  wonderful and the choreography is original, fresh and keeps your eyes constantly on the screen.  The movie is very well cast and Ron Moody is wonderful as Fagin.  He is \\"nicer\\" than in the book (maybe it's the pet owl they gave him)  but his basic motivations and actions remain the same albeit he has a happier more ambiguous ending in the film. Oliver Reed is probably a more physically attractive Bill Sikes than the one most people imagine from reading Dickens' work but he is certainly menacing and scary.  Nancy, also, is much lovelier (as well as older) than the novel describes  but the part is excellently acted and sung by Shani Wallis.  The child actors are all engaging and do not have the smugness (well the Artful and Charlie are supposed to be \\"cheeky\\") too many times seen in young kids in movies. <br />    The plot is simplified from the book and a few characters like Rose and Oliver's evil half brother Monks are left out for time's sake but it does not hurt the story since it could be argued that the original has too many complicated subplots.  Some \\"exciting\\" scenes are added for the action loving moviegoer and rather disturbingly innocent Oliver is present at the scenes of both Nancy and Bill's demise. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble do not have the larger, very comic, parts they play in both the novel and the originial musical though  Mr. Bumble's \\"the law then sir is a bachelor...and may he learn from experience\\"  speech is included and is almost word for word from Dicken's original writing as are many other critical speeches throughout the film.  Oliver is a wonderful gem the whole family can enjoy.  The DVD does have to be flipped over and there are not many extras but these are minor quibbles in such a great viewing experience.     <br /> <br />

Kisses Don't Lie- Really annoying after awhile <br />3. Unfaithful- Very good vocals, another popular one <br />4. We Ride- I don't get the point of the song, but it has a single out, so... <br />5. Dem Haters- An attempt at being gangsta <br />6. Final Goodbye- Boring  <br />7. Break It Off- Great idea featuring Sean Paul... but it doesn't work for me <br />8. Crazy Little Thing Called Love- Another love song <br />9. Selfish Girl- Uh... Has Rihanna ran out of topics to sing about? <br />10. P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)- ANOTHER love song <br />11. A Girl Like Me- For being the album's title, it's not too great <br />12. A Million Miles Away- Not really a typical Rihanna song <br />13. If It's Lovin Pt. 2- A sort of remix on the original.  i still like the first better.  oh yes another LOVE SONG <br /> <br />Well there it is.  the only reason i'd buy it is if you haven't already got SOS and Unfaithful off iTunes or Limewire or something like that.

0553801503|5.0|I completely agree with Robert A. Leibowitz's review.  Although I was a little frustrated with the limited POV chapters (and they weren't my favorite characters. . .although George keeps killing them!!!) there was so much going on in this book I still couldn't put it down.  The never ending plot twists, secrets unveiled and suprises will keep me coming back until the end.
0783225725|5.0|This movie is amazing.  The Stranger comes out of the ether in the beginning of the movie as a lone horserider appears like a blurry mirage riding through the desert.  He enters the small mining town of Lago.  All eyes are on him as he rides down the street.  What happens next is original, violent, and politically incorrect.  This movie should be seen by all fans of westerns and the twilight zone.   <br /> <br />This is Eastwoods best work in my opinion.  And the stranger is as removed from \\"The man with no name\\" as he is from \\"Josey Wales\\".  People lump this movie in with the trilogy sometimes, but there are great differences between them.  The Stranger is never in trouble, never in a position of weakness.  He came to destory the town and deal out vengence on the people.  This has more in common with \\"Needful Things\\" than anything.  And King probably got some of his ideas from this movie.   <br /> <br />The ending is up in the air.  Was he the dead marshal, an avenging angel, the marshal's brother?  You decide.  I like the look of this movie, the sound, the premise.  It is a classic.  A friendly warning though there are some strong scences in this movie.  But if you are as jaded as I am you will love this movie.

B000000W5B|5.0|You want proof Charlie's the best drummer in rock? Listen to Heartbreaker then Angie and you should know. Heartbreaker starts unusually for a Stones rocker with a keyboard riff then with a brief but perfect drum roll then the song begins to drive with a simple but oh so swinging pattern. Angie has beautifully understated drumming which both eases the song along and plays subtly along to acetuate the vocal. Gorgeous.  Heartbreaker deserves more recognition than it gets as it is one of the best big arrangement songs they've done with driving rhythm from Keith, Charlie, Bill and the keyboards and some nice wah wah guitar and a great solo from Mick Taylor. <br />The album has lots of other songs that grow on you such as 100 Years Ago, Winter, Coming Down Again and CanYou Hear the Music. I'm not quite as keen on Silver Train as it seems like a poor cousin of All Down the Line. All in all this should be in all Stones fans collections. And you've gotta love that drumming!
B000002JSR|2.0|Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.
B000EGF0B4|4.0|Brokeback Mountain is the story of Ennis del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), two young men who meet and fall in love in 1963 on a sheepherding job on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. The film documents their complex relationship over the next twenty years.    Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.  When the two men first begin work on Brokeback Mountain, Ennis is stationed at the base camp while Jack watches after the sheep higher on the mountain. They initially meet only for meals at the base camp, where they gradually become friends. After a time they switch roles, with Jack taking over duties at base camp and Ennis tending the flock. One night, after the two share a bottle of whiskey, Ennis decides to remain at the base camp overnight instead of returning up the mountain. Ennis is at first reluctant to even sleep in the same tent as Jack, but late that night the men share a brief, intense sexual encounter. Over the remainder of the summer their sexual and emotional relationship deepens further.    After the two part ways at the end of their job, Ennis marries his long-term fiancée Alma Beers (Williams), and starts a family. Jack moves to Texas, where he meets and marries rodeo princess Lureen Newsome (Hathaway). The couple soon has a son.    Four years later, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack asking if he wants to meet when Jack passes through the area. The men reunite, and their passion immediately rekindles. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch. Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a gay man in his hometown, fears that such an arrangement can only end in tragedy. He is also unwilling to leave his family. Unable to be open about their relationship, Ennis and Jack settle for infrequent meetings on camping trips in the mountains.       Ledger as Ennis Del Mar.As the years pass, Ennis's marriage deteriorates. Unknown to him, the relationship was discovered by Alma who eventuallydivorces him and takes custody of their two daughters. Jack hopes that Ennis's divorce will allow them to live together at last, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Meanwhile, his oldest daughter, Alma Junior, visits Ennis on a periodic basis, and Ennis meets and dates a waitress. On another trip with Jack in the mountains, Ennis insists, to keep his job, he cannot meet with Jack again before November. Ennis and Jack's frustrations finally erupt into a bitter argument and a struggle becoming a desperate embrace. However, the two men part upset.    Months later, a postcard Ennis sent to Jack, about meeting in November, is returned in the mail, stamped \\"deceased\\". In a strained telephone conversation, Jack's wife Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died in an accident. As she explains, a brief scene of Jack being beaten to death, by 3 men, illustrates Ennis' fears that Jack's death was not accidental. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wished to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain. She suggests that Ennis contact Jack's parents about this.    Ennis visits Jack's parents and offers to take Jack's ashes to Brokeback Mountain. Jack's father refuses, insisting that Jack's remains be buried in the family plot. Jack's mother is more welcoming, and allows Ennis to see Jack's boyhood bedroom. Ennis discovers in this room, two old shirts hidden in the back of the closet. The shirts, hung one inside the other on the same hanger, are the ones the two men were wearing on their last day on Brokeback Mountain in 1963.    Shortly after Ennis meets Jack's parents, his daughter visits him at his home. Now 19 years old, she's getting ready to marry a boy, and asks for her father's consent in giving her away at the wedding. Ennis seems initially reluctant, citing that he might have to work, but decides against it and pours two glasses of whiskey for him and his daughter with which to celebrate. Ennis asks if her fiance loves her, and she affirms that he does.    At the end of the movie, Ennis opens his own closet to reveal that he has hung the two shirts reversed, with his plaid shirt hugging Jack's blue shirt, inside the door beneath a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis carefully fastens the top button of Jack's shirt. With tears in his eyes, Ennis mutters, \\"Jack, I swear . . . .\\" [9], and then, he slowly, carefully straightens the postcard of Brokeback Mountain and closes the door. As the door closes on the closet, it opens a long view to the outside, through the window, to the green and yellow fields and the dirt road outside  Heath Ledger has putten his best in the movie. Michelle Williams was good in her role as an innocent wife who discovers her husband's secret. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well Jake ....., Anne Hathaway and Randy Quaid.   The movie is outstanding. Great direction by Anglee. Brilliant Cinematography. Lots of Profanity especially the F word, Nudity, Sex and Homosexuality as well. A little violence included. Not a movie for children to watch at all.     Above All a very touching love story. Recomended viewing.
B00008WT5E|4.0|Mostly good, but not entirely. Still, it's got Down Payment Blues, Sin City, What's Next to the Moon and Riff Raff, all of which should be (but aren't) AC/DC classics. I'm no fan of Kicked in the Teeth or Up to My Neck In You, but no AC/DC album (except Back in Black) is perfect. Overall, Powerage is good.

1421506270|4.0|Somebody in the Yotsuba corporation is killing off the company's business rivals and L, Light, and the few remaining detectives have figured out that someone in Yotsuba is Kira. The problem is figuring out who it is. If they try to move in on the group of seven suspects, then Kira might go into hiding or pass on his power to someone else. No, L MUST know how Kira kills before he is arrested. Misa is sent undercover with a coverstory that she was once suspected of being the second Kira and that she wants to meet Kira because he killed the murderer of her parents and wants to thank him. Something unexpected happens when Rem, Misa's ex-Shinigami touches her with a piece of Death Note, making her visible to Misa and reveals the truth about Light and herself as the first two Kiras and the identity of the new Kira! Now Misa will have to use all her acting skills to not upset Light's plans or reveal her newfound knowledge to L AND keep herself from getting killed at the same time!  <br /> <br />Death Note is really starting to get good now. You'll pretty much find yourself sitting down and reading the whole book in one take and wanting more. One of the most interesting aspects of this volume and the previous one is to see Light playing the good guy, and perhaps he IS a good guy. I mean, would the killing of vicious criminals really be a bad thing? Everybody would probably have a different answer to that one, based on their own life experiences. Death Note is also great because over these six volumes you really get to know the characters because there isn't a ton of action. Most of it is characterization and mental chess playing, which is a welcome break from most Hollywood-type entertainment in this day and age. Death Note is a good read.
B000006045|4.0|Wow is all I can say about this one. Of all the Massive Attack CD's I own this is by far the best and darkest. Heres a little in depth review for ya. <br /> <br />-Angel (5/5) - Awesome song. It blows me away everytime I hear it. The hard beats w/ the moody landscapes do it for me. It's been used in alot of movies so you've probobly heard it before. <br />-Risingson (4/5) - Another great track. We get some nice rapping here which isn't too stale, accompanied by a nice beat. Pretty good. <br />-Teardrop (5/5) - This is awesome. The piano really adds to the depth of the song. Vocals (Liz Fraser) are pretty darn good as well. This was used in the opening to the \\"House\\" series so if you've seen that then this should be recognizable. It's a slow song, but it holds my attention pretty well. <br />-Inertia Creeps (4/5) - \\"Intertia creeps, she's moving up slowly\\"...yep this pretty much describes this track. Everything about this is worth noting. I especially like the guitar the've been using, which honestly hasn't been heard in any of Massive Attack's songs. <br />-Exchange (Instrumental) (3/5) - Gotta love this one. Kinda has a lounge feel to it. Even though its just an instrumental is worth listening too. <br />-Dissolved Girl (5/5) - Beautiful. It's my favorite track on the album. The vocals (Sara Jay) once again are top notch. This was the first song by Massive Attack I heard and it's still great. I love the way they change things up around the 3 min mark. <br />-Man Next Door (3/5) - Kinda wierd, but its still listenable. The beats and electronica are dead on, but the vocals seem a little weak. One part sounds like he's saying \\"always a forseen fart\\". <br />-Black Milk (2/5) - I dunno about this one. Vocals arn't as good as the others. I just thought this was kinda boring. The remix \\"Black Melt\\" is a little better. <br />-Mezzanine (3/5) - Not bad. It's the title track so you'll be hearing something good. <br />-Group Four (1/5) - Don't like this one. Seemed more likea filler, but I can give it a little credit. <br />-Exchange (3/5) - We get the full vocal line this time, but it doen't help much. The same guy that did the singing for \\"Man Next Door\\" is on this one and his voice is pretty interesting. This is a great closing I must say though. <br /> <br />And thats it. Once again this is Massive Attack's best CD which deserves to be bought. If you are already a fan of Massive Attack...what are you doing? GET THIS! You wont be dissapointed.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I have had this album since it was released,and it really has taken me some time to digest.  It overall reminds me of an amazing blend of Zeplinish vocals/rythms with Sabbath hardness.  An interesting revival of an older sounding music, with the crispness on new mastering.  An interesting piece for any collection. If your a fan of the older sound, this will work great for you.
B0002S64OG|4.0|I got this DVD as a gift, and thought it would be just another standard baby DVD.  But it turned out to be much better than our others -- definitely hits the mark.  Both of my kids (6 months and 3 years) love it -- my older one for the animated nursery rhymes and Rokenbok toys; and my younger one is glued to just about everything, the whole time.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|It is no co-incidence that while John Frusciante is clean and sober, the chili's keep producing there best work in a long time. While this album does not reach the heights of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, it is painfully close and only a matter of time before these four great musicians reach there peak again.<br /><br />All four members have battled there demons over the years, but none have had the rollercoaster ride of guitarist John Frusciante. Here is a man who basically had to learn his trade all over again after surviving a terrible heroin addiction and almost gave music away completely. But it is good to see after 8 years back with RHCP, he is back to his creative best.<br /><br />Anthony's vocals on this record I believe are the best sounding yet while Chad and Flea just keep delivering album after album.<br /><br />After listening to this record there is no reason why the Red Hot Chili Peppers won't keep going for years to come, delivering us more great records and more great live shows. These guys will just keep getting better now that John is clearly here to stay.<br /><br />Also check out my reviews on John's solo work. Anyone who hasn't discovered the world of John Frusciante yet, is missing out on something very special.
B000FWI8Q6|5.0|You can't miss with this one - All 12 tracks are THE CROONER's original recordings from the late 1950s. All are the most recognized and loved versions we heard on the radio and got on MCA's LP when it became available. Sound is great for an earlier CD release, we haven't heard a more recent release that is any better.
B00018TI5E|5.0|This is definitely Johns best work yet. It is also the most commercial but I won't hold that against him. From the opening note of 'carvel' to the final sound of 'the slaughter', this record will ring in your head long after you've played it. The songwriting has taken another big step forward, the melodies on this album are the catchiest yet, whilst the lyrics are filled with honesty and make perfect sense, unlike the drug-filled ramblings of his first two releases. It almost feels like John is singing the songs to you and not into a tape.<br />The presence of John's good buddy Josh Klinghoffer on this album makes it even better. They are both very talented musicians in there own right, but together they form a partnership which takes them higher than anyone. A partnership which fortunately still lasts today. A highlight of this album is Josh's vocals on 'Omission'.<br />Also lending out on this album is Chad Smith on drums, while Flea lends his bass to 'The Slaughter'. Charlie Clouser of Nine Inch Nails fame provides orchestral programming on a couple of songs, 'Regret' and 'Chances'.<br />My favourite tracks on this album are 'Regret', a song so simple but yet stirs up so much emotion from within, it is hard not to be moved by this track. And 'Second Walk', a song which sums up John perfectly.<br />Also listen out for 'Ricky', 'Every Person'(I think the line \\"A ship out in the distance is here if I draw it\\" is just the best ever), the catchy' Song To Sing When I'm lonely' and the experimental '23 Go In To The End'.<br />I believe this is a must have album for all RHCP fans as it will open your eyes to a whole new world. The world of John Frusciante, the greatest living musician in the world today...
B000EMGJM2|4.0|I think this is a great CD with a different type of R&B sound.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I was all prepared to accuse Rise Against off selling out after the release of their single \\"Swing Life Away\\" from \\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture,\\" released in 2004. But after listening to their 2006 album \\"The Sufferer and the Witness\\" I realize that they haven't sold out, they have simply outgrown the limitations of the punk-genre. And it's all good. <br /> <br />2001 saw the release of \\"The Unraveling,\\" a quality punk album with 16 tracks clocking in at under 37 minutes. (Do the math.) With 2003 came \\"Revolutions Per Minute,\\" which is as much hardcore as punk with its pummeling drums and group-shouted refrains.  \\"Siren Song\\" displays Rise Against's evolution as a band, mixing into the hardcore-punk base a few more fleshed-out rock songs that break out of the three chord mold.  At a mainstream length 12 songs and 40 minutes and the inclusion of several acoustic moments (not to mention the MTV-embraced \\"Swing Life Away\\"), this album shows definite growth. <br /> <br />Now we have the completion of the process, \\"The Sufferer and the Witness.\\" The leadoff track \\"Chamber the Cartridge\\" proves their punk bona fides have not withered away.  Next is \\"Injection\\" and the pattern of complex, melodic punk-rock is established.  Most of the album continues with this pattern, with occasional deviations, always for the better.  Some of the best tracks are in the middle of the album. \\"Prayer of the Refugee\\" for example begins with an acoustic-ballad sound before roaring into a dramatically uptempo screaming chorus.  Next is \\"Drones,\\" which hews toward punk-emo if there is such a thing, and I mean that in a good way. Rise Against forgoes the typical social commentary/establishment criticism for a personal song with the refrain \\"If you see me please just walk on by, walk on by...forget my name, and I'll forget it too.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Sufferer and the Witness\\" might not be a purely-punk album, but neither is it a sell-out album.  It is, simply, an awesome, genre-defying rockmasterpiece showing a band at the apex of their career. <br />
B0000255CL|5.0|As any black metal fan will tell you, Immortal are easily one of the best bands of the genre. They never disappoint and remain one of my all time favorite bands over the years. Many consider At the Heart of Winter to be their best album and although I could never bring myself to pick one as I enjoy all of them since each offer their own unique sound, this definitely contains a few of Immortal's best songs. One thing that easily stands out throughout the  album is that the songwriting and musicianship is absolutely fantastic. The intro to At the Heart of Winter is simply brilliant, causing the listener to suddenly feel as if he has been transported into the depths of winter. The songs contain an eerie cold atmosphere yet also display a sense of beauty. Anyway, if your a fan of Immortal you should already have this album but if your just starting out with them, this is a great album to start with.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|This album has continued to grow on me.  I've given it 5 stars, but would give a higher grade if I could.  It's not quite like anything else I've heard so I can't really classify it.  But, the bottom line is whether or not it sounds good to the listener, not the category of music it might be placed within.  And this album sounds great.  This is a group of tremendous talents, writing, playing and communicating with their audience.  Also, Fantastic Place is spectacular (for you Seinfeld fans).  From beginning to end one of the best songs I've ever heard.  Can't wait for their next release.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|This was a good movie, although I think more background/history of the storyline should have been provided. Overall I would recommend.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Finally, a CD you can feel like you got your money's worth. Every song is so different and clean, it's really refreshing to the ear!
0060920432|5.0|If you are a runner, a cyclist, or other endurance sport type, you're probably familiar with something similar to what Csikszentmihalyi calls \\"flow.\\"  Think of that moment when you stop feeling as though what you are doing is \\"work,\\" when you no longer think of giving up, but only of going on. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, many of us go through life rarely ever experiencing \\"flow.\\" <br /> <br />The concept is simple.  Happiness comes when we feel in control of our actions -- and these moments don't happen when we are at rest (usually), instead, \\"the best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.\\" <br /> <br />Flow is not a self-help book, at least not in the sense of offering you \\"ten steps to eternal happiness\\" or worksheets or exercises.  Instead, it is a popularized examination of the intellectual bases for the concept of flow.  Instead of quoting long lists of scholars, Csikszentmihalyi uses copious \\"real life\\" examples to illustrate the concepts he introduces (this is an aspect Flow shares with self-help books). <br /> <br />Even without the exercises or the ten steps or the motivational quotes, Flow can be very helpful for a reader who is experiencing boredom, anxiety, lethargy, lack of purpose, and hasn't figured out why. <br /> <br />For me, Flow helped me understand the reasons for a years-long depression and gave me the language necessary to begin to describe what I felt was missing in my own life.  I started reading this book about the same time I started seeing a life coach, and it has really helped me in those sessions. <br /> <br />Your mileage may vary, of course, but Flow is still a fascinating and not very dense look at an important aspect of the human condition.
087349976X|4.0|I've learned a few new techniques in the book.  Well illustrated.  Thank you.
0767812166|5.0|This is our favorite Jeff Bridges film.  The story and the cast are exceptional.  We still use several quotes in our daily lives, like \\"You're not from around here?\\"  Great film that is timeless.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This Director's cut is way much better than the theatrical release. This latest dvd release displays Ridley Scott's original vision of the film & it incorporates all the deleted scenes into the movie. I thoroughly enjoy Ridley's movies & this one ranks up there. I won't give anything away on this review, just watch it when you get a chance...it is definitely worth watching again. The whole thing just makes much more sense.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I thought this movie was slow to get started -- too much character development.  The 'horror' scenes were pretty well done.  The hero gets away a little too easily.  Overall, pretty good, but I would probably rent this instead of purchasing if I want to see it again.
