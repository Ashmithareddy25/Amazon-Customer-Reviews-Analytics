030745455X|3.0|Millenium publisher, Mikael Blomkvist has commissioned a young journalist to write an expose on Sweden's sex trade. However, the journalist and his partner are murdered in their apartment. The murder weapon is left behind by the killer, and the clues lead the police put Lisbeth Salander in the frame for the murders.<br /><br />This book gets off to a faster start than its predecessor, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but I felt as the story unfolded, it was not as good as the earlier book. For me, this was because the story was too long, by a couple of hundred pages.  As a result, there was exciting parts in the story, but also large parts where I was almost skimming through the pages. Overall, it was okay, but I had expected it to be better.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|The Kindle pricing is exploitive.  The Kindle sales pitch was that the initial cost would be defrayed by the reduced cost of electrinic publishing.  Now the publisher hase sent out a letter implying that the one time cost of setting up for electronic publishing is greater than the cost of actually printing, warehousing, distrinuting and shipping millions of books.  He has transformed himself from simply greedy to a greedy liar.  Amazon should focus its considerable negotiating power to adocate for its customers on this issue.  It is just wrong.
B004SKJIEC|5.0|One of Stevie Wonder's seminal albums, \\"Songs in The Key of Life\\" receives the audiophile treatment from Audio Fidelity. This new remaster is a marked improvement on the remaster from a decade ago; the album sounds full, warm but without the goosed bass and bright sound of that previous remaster.<br /><br />How does this compare to the original CD issue? Detail and clarity are slightly better but the biggest improvement comes in area of the bass and soundstage the latter particularly has greater depth and dimension to it. Stevie's vocals also sound marvelous here--a marked improvement over some of the previous editions.<br /><br />I've had some issues with some of the Audio Fidelity reissues on CD. For example \\"The Pretenders\\" and reissue of The Doors' \\"The Soft Parade\\" both suffered from peak limiting (and in the case of \\"The Pretenders\\" there was at least one overdub that was missing because it was \\"flown in\\" later for the original release)and The Cars' \\"Heartbeat City\\" although a stronger, sharper sounding release didn't have the flow of the original album with its overlapping and quicker fades. I can happily report none of these issues are apparent here.<br /><br />The artwork which also was an issue with some of the early AF releases isn't an issue here either; the full booklet with all the lyrics has been included. Although the type is a bit smaller than I had hoped for the lyrics and credits, the print is clear and the quality of the glossy paper is more so what one would expect from an audiophile release. As with all AF releases (a carry over from the old DCC)we get images of the original vinyl labels included in the booklet which continues to be a nice touch.<br /><br />I do wish that AF would adopt the SACD/CD hybrid format for their releases (although even Mobile Fidelity only uses it on select titles based on their licensing agreement). Although this is marked as an HDCD release that has to do with (if I recall correctly)the use of the HDCD converters during the analog to digital process and the peak extensions characteristic of most HDCDs isn't presented here (which could be good or bad depending on how you listen to your music--on a regular CD player for example HDCD can sound a bit shrill and bright to some folks).<br /><br />For those who do have SACD players the SHM SACD recently reissued from Japan reportedly sounds remarkable and has a slightly better soundstage and detail than this CD remaster. I don't own it but that has been attributed to everything from the fact that it's an SACD (although NOT a hybrid--I only purchase hybrids which is why I don't have this so I can play them anywhere)to the remaster being slightly goosed. I can't comment on the latter but the former makes sense. For a regular CD issue however this is probably the best one out there with an improved soundstage, depth and less \\"thin\\" sounding compared to the original CD issue and a marked improvement over the goosed remaster from a decade ago.<br /><br />Over all this is an impressive presentation of a classic album and I'm happy that AF has done such a fine job with this release. Kudos to AF and Kevin Gray (who did the remastering here)for doing such a fine job with this seminal release.ess and the peak extensions characteristic of most HDCDs isn't presented here (which could be good or bad depending on how you listen to your music--on a regular CD player for example HDCD can sound a bit shrill and bright to some folks).

B000VDDWDS|5.0|Still my favorite movie, Master and Commander is an excellent story intertwining friendship and what one does with duty and having to choose the \\"lesser of two evils.\\"  Excellent writing, filming, music (the sound track is equally excellent and enjoyable).  I love the books that this movie is based on as well, and the fact that the movie takes parts from various books to make a type of synopsis doesn't bother me a bit (and that's saying something); it just goes to show how good Weir is at telling the deep gist of a story. [I can't believe this movie has an overall lower rating than The Truman Show.]

0307592839|1.0|This book is mediocre at best, but I actually hated it. I really cannot believe it won the Pulitzer Prize. I checked it out at the library after it was on nearly every recommended summer reading list in 2010. I read a little more than half and decided life was too short to waste my time finishing it. This reeks of the all-too-common situation in which critics and book industry insiders feed off of each other to propel a book/author to the top, with or without merit. I didn't care about any of the characters or the ridiculous story lines in this book. I am in my 30s and interested in the music scene, but there was nothing to maintain my interest in this book.

B0043RSE2M|4.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />There are about 32 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, another 11 around 25% and 4 more that exceeded 25%. At least 10 of the 32, 10% effects were just a nose sticking out. The in-screen 3D is fairly consistent but has a SLIGHTLY shallower depth of field compared to other 3Ds.

B0041IXVIK|3.0|Fair movie not near as good as the first. Much better than the second one. My main problem with the story line. Is with the predators handling of the aleins over thousands of years! I think that the safe guards would be in place to prevent the aleins from doing what they did in this movie. The writers should have looked to the comic books for ideas. All this movie seemed to me was a rip off of the series Deadlest Warrior. I'm surprised they didn't include the Spartan.

0061205699|5.0|Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is the feistiest girl in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's.  She's six years old and doesn't care to be a lady. She wants to wear pants all her life and mess around with her older brother Jem and their friend, Dill, who visits every summer.  To Kill a Mockingbird spans over a couple years of Scout's life, during which she becomes engaged to Dill, attempts to befriend a reclusive neighbor - and, most importantly, witnesses a trial during which a young black man is accused of raping a poor young white girl.  These events are seen from the young, questioning eyes of a little girl who wants to understand.  It is heart-breaking, eye-opening, and a book that everyone should take the time to devour.<br /><br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />My thoughts -<br />This is my first time reading To Kill a Mockingbird (people have looked at me, shocked, for saying that), and not only can I say that I've read it, but I can also say that I loved it.<br /><br />I was quite moved by this story.  Moved to laughter, moved to sorrow, moved to anger, moved to love.  I was inspired by this little girl Jean Louise who saw the world so innocently.  I wanted to be like her.  I want to be like her.  She was precious to read about.<br /><br />Character notes -<br />Scout Finch has a sarcasm that's hard to miss.  It adds life to the story and made me laugh.  She's one smart little seven-year-old.  She understands most things - and when she doesn't she asks questions.  Questions that made me think.  Questions that seven-year-olds now would never think to ask.  Scout is also a deep thinker, pondering the world in that innocent light that she views everything.<br /><br />She loves her family.  She has a heart for her brother...wants to do everything to be like him.  When he starts to grow up, she doesn't understand it, but she tries her hardest.  Because she loves him.<br />And she loves her father, too.  Oh boy, their relationship tugged at my heart more than anything else in this story.  Atticus Finch is older, has no wife, and would be lonely but for his lovely children.  Scout and Jem mean everything him, and he means everything to them, even when they would like to say otherwise.  Atticus very easily became my favorite character - for his bravery, his selflessness, his humility, and his desire to do what is right...at all costs.<br /><br />Story notes -<br />This story is well told from the first word to the last.  It weaves in family troubles, characters being built, the culture in the south in that time of history, the town's trials and triumphs, strange neighbors, unlikely friends...  All of this is seen through the eyes of an observant six/seven/eight year old, and I can't imagine it any other way.  It was the perfect touch for the story's progression.<br /><br />Speaking of the progression...it was slow.  But not in an \\"I'm bored, please get me out of here\\" way, but in a languid, beautiful, floating way.  It was a current, slow and constant, and it pulled me along until we reached the shore, where I sat, watching the tide drifting away, knowing that I would never forget that experience.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book, I expected it to be mainly about the rape trial.  While I was at first confused that it wasn't, I couldn't stay confused for long.  The depth and intense character development in the rest of the story led up to the trial and its outcome - and even events after the trial.<br /><br />One word I'd use to sum up this novel (final thoughts) -<br />Eager.  Because while the whole town is languid, underneath the surface a passion is stirring - and it is seen in Atticus and his bravery; Miss Maudie and her garden; Jem and his desire to be like his father; Tom Robinson and his innocent friendship with the poor white girl; and little Scout, who cannot get enough of her world, and who won't let it fly by without having a word or two with it.  This really is one exceptional story.
B004SQS9FA|4.0|Radiohead's latest release, \\"The King of Limbs\\", is by all means a solid album, despite its size.  As a whole, the album gives a unified impression of being lost, and, as it resolves, found.      At the opener of the album, Bloom, we hear an electronic loop before the rest of the band joins in.  To me, the loop itself gave me the impression of Muse's \\"In Your World\\", and then immediately the other instruments began to play, and I was confused.  My first impression was that the song deliberately sounded discombobulated.  However, as the song progressed, or rather, bloomed, it began to sound unified, and gradually the song began to sound less like a poor mash up of several different tracks, and more like a coherent and strong piece of work.    Other than Bloom, I am of the opinion that Lotus Flower, Codex, and Separator are the strongest songs on this album, Separator being my personal favorite.  Lotus Flower is reminiscent of the Hail to the Thief era Radiohead, with added influence from Thom Yorke's solo album, the Eraser. However it also reminds me of the beginning of I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab For Cutie.  Codex, a piece in D Aeolian (Otherwise known as D Natural Minor, which is the F Major scale, but starting and ending on D.), is breathtaking.  My only problem with the album, comes in the form of the placement of the song Give Up the Ghost.  When placed after Codex, it gives the opinion that the album is beginning to get stuck in a rut, because of the lack of change in tempo     Finally, we have the album's closer, Separator.  It is more up tempo than Codex and Give up the Ghost and as a song, it takes a slightly more conventional approach.    For those who do not quite understand where this album is coming from, I point you to these albums, which should hopefully help \\"explain\\" \\"The King Of Limbs\\" to a certain extent.    Thom Yorke- The Eraser  Jonny Greenwood- Popcorn Superhet Reciever (You can hear it on NPR's website)  Jonny Greenwood- Soundtracksto Bodysong and There Will Be Blood (Part of which incorporates Popcorn...)  Phillip Selway- Familial.    After listening to these albums, you can begin to understand where this album has come from.  The electronic influences from Thom Yorke, and to a certain extent Jonny Greenwood, and the atmosphere certainly bares a resemblance to that of Phillip Selway's album, which is quite surprising.    Overall, this is certainly not the Bends, OK Computer, or In Rainbows.  It's the King of Limbs.  But if you're a Radiohead fan, you should have learned by now not to expect the same thing twice and to just go with the band, because it's usually worth it eventually.      Just my two cents.    PS.  After exploring a website, listen.[...], a free streaming website, I discovered an early version of Morning Mr. Magpie.  They should have left it in its original form.  It sounds like a lost track from the bends!

B004A8ZWT2|4.0|Once again I think the bad reviews are based on people's expectations. Modern spy thrillers tend to throw constant action scenes at you. This film was meant to be a throw back film to older films like Charade, To Catch A Thief, North By Northwest, etc. It's light-hearted, fun entertainment, without explosions and freaky stunts.  The stars, Deep and Jolie are great together. Angelina Jolie wears beautiful clothes in this film and looks amazing. The movie is filmed beautifully, mostly in Venice. My favorite scene, however, is in the train when she meets Frank, witty and cute dialogue. Very entertaining, just don't take it too seriously. We saw it on Blu Ray, excellent picture quality and nice extras.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|Who goes into a ACTION movie and expect Oscar winning acting ? No one, you go to an action movie for ACTION, and on that standpoint this movie delivered, great action,Now it definitely wasn't Independence day(the cream of the crop in alien movies) but Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum wasnt in this either. But it reminded me of playing Killzone(PS3) or Gears of War(XBOX), it was a lot of fun to watch, now yes the acting and one liners were pretty corny, but who cares?, it was a good, fun, shoot em up bang bang type of movie, that me and my girlfriend enjoyed...Worth buying.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|This sucked. It cured me of the alien invasion craze. I was really into them, or so I thought. Independence Day, 10 stars. Cloverfield, 10. War of the Worlds, 9 stars (the original probably 5). Day the Earth Stood Still (the original) 9. Even the lowly Battlefield Earth and Skyline, 8 stars. . . I have now met an alien invasion movie I didn't like. If this film was intended to be some kind of recruitment-ad for the military the joke is on whoever financed the movie. Another reviewer writes that this movie only serves to make 'Skyline' look like an academy award winner.<br /><br />There was one point in the movie where I did like it. When the rag-tag team figures out they need to destroy 'area X' and they finally have a mission, I just knew they would succeed. So do the soldiers. They have a mission and they're confident they are going to complete it. Lots of things will be blown up no doubt. This probably reflects badly on me, although perhaps I was just desperate to see anything entertaining at this point. In defense of the movie, it's probably tough being a shinning star covered by a giant NATO helmet. It is Hollywood, perhaps they should have used custom made/identical but scaled helmets rather than real ones.<br /><br />The soldiers in the movie spend most of their time, not fighting aliens, but trying to protect and cover the escape of 4 or 5 civilians. They would have been better off given a map or pointed in the direction East. Perhaps I'm cruel and heartless but when one of the soldiers gets injured it seemed idiotic the whole team rallies to save them. It's surprising the aliens didn't wipe all of them out while they made the effort. In one scene we learn the aliens don't 'leave anyone behind' either.<br /><br />I've been in a situation where I thought I might go to war, myself. What they tell you to get you to fight is not what you think it would be. You're going into combat as part of an effort to 'rescue corporal John X' who's been captured by the enemy. I suppose the unconscious message being leadership cares about you. Perhaps we feel guilty when faced with their superior morality, as they send us off to die in whatever numbers necessary.<br /><br />Battle: Los Angeles could have been interesting. There was an Outer Limits episode where aliens capture Australia (it was really a love story similar to Casablanca). Another episode had the various nations on Earth more frightened of each other, their main concern being collaboration with the visiting aliens. Watching the commercial, I wondered whether the aliens from District 9 had returned, or, since their technology seemed similar to ours, if maybe the aliens intended to lose the war. Thinking we'd defeated them and seen their worst being the only way we'd let them 'stay' on Earth. This was as interesting as a World War I movie. It may have been based on one.<br /><br />The water angle was almost interesting. There were some interesting parts in the movie. When one of the soldiers sacrifices himself to kill some aliens it reminds us (me at least) of suicide bombers trying to kill Western soldiers. They experiment with and kill one of the captured aliens (while they are in danger of being captured by his alien friends), I suppose if we're feeling guilty we feel better at the end when sarge becomes a hero. At the end, when the tide has somehow turned, and one says, 'lets take back Los Angeles', all I could think was, haha good luck with that my white brothers.<br /><br />To take the ending more seriously, for a tiny moment - it would be interesting to compare the ending to All Quiet on the Western Front, where one of the characters is killed near the end of the war on a day only noted as 'All Quiet'. This movie has an aggressive ending, as did the invasion movie Skyline.<br /><br />Us darn audiences are getting too sophisticated. . . they can't have us thinking we're being pacified as they set about on our extermination? And that they have, white Americans will soonbe one minority in the country among many. Perhaps such a demographic split is only the beginning of being fair, nothing however, will stop white population decline in North American. No matter what's done or what happens, white population numbers will drop lower and lower for succeeding generations while most other racial groups increase in number. White numbers could eventually stabilize. I'm guessing it's unlikely, and something not desired by everyone. By some, yes, by some, less likely. For such a scenario I would suggest checking out the year 2022 and 'Soylent Green'.be one minority in the country among many.

B003L77GRO|3.0|As a self-proclaimed Dexteraholic (my wife and I watched all 5 seasons in under a month) I feel somewhat guilty writing a 3-star review. This show provided us with many hours of great entertainment. But in comparison to Seasons 1-4, three stars seems appropriate. I suppose were are all a little spoiled after the twists and turns and intricate plotlines in earlier seasons. But this season leaves almost nothing to the imagination. It's completely watchable, but it's also completely forgettable. The dark humor is also notably absent this season. If you've watched the first 4 seasons then I know you will watch Season 5 despite any negative reviews. And you should watch it, if only to stay current. But if you're new to this great series, don't start here. Seasons 1 and 2 are much stronger.
1594481717|1.0|I wish I could get contact info for the editor(s) at Riverhead Books / Berkley Publishing / Penguin Group so I could get such a lightweight book idea as this \\"Whole New Mind\\" into print myself! It has the look-and-feel of a magazine article that's been \\"puffed up\\" into a book-length manuscript.    Pardon my left-brain talking, but this book has little to no factual content. No figures or statistics, it's all anecdotes, or \\"stories\\" and \\"metaphors\\" such as this guy Pink is so fond of. Pink cannot be contradicted because he has nothing substantial to say. Just stuff like:    1) Abundance, Asia, and Automation are making knowledge-based work obsolete, or at least less important. Duh. Where's this guy been the past 32 years since Carter normalized relations with the PRC, and then Reagan deregulated every business area in sight? So we all have to learn this touchy-feely feminized right-brain \\"thinking\\". Ahem. (he does hedge with a perfunctory \\"oh don't get me wrong, we'll still need some left-brain thinking. No, this isn't really calling for a pussification of our labor force. etc etc. Then he goes right back to the commie-pinko right-brain lecture.)  2) High Concept High Touch aptitudes raised to the stature of Social Law by being enshrined as the \\"Conceptual Age\\" -- \\"now we're progressing yet again to a society of creators and empathizers.\\" Creating just what? he cares not to say except that we will all become \\"artists\\" (and no explanation there either). Empathizers? Who's going to make livings doing that? Self-indulgent pontification of this Author. This I do not call \\"progress\\".  3) The Search for Meaning and the Cultural Creatives. Okay. the USA labor force of 150+ million is going to become en masse a collective of \\"Artistes\\" who will light the way for the unwashed masses and lowly left-brainers of Asia/Africa who will continue slaving in the manufacturing/informational Satanic Mills.    Just how many livelihoods can be sustained doing \\"art\\"? The few examples of these \\"artists\\" actually performing paying work that Pink cites -- lawyers going into the graphic arts/presentation business, auto body \\"sculptors\\", marketers -- are businesses where there is room for only a very very few practitioners. There are two prominent examples of nations that are known for having a large presence in this area: Italy and France. Relatively large segments of their national economies are in the crafts and novelties business: \\"art\\". And look at their rates of chronic unemployment. If an economy the size of the USA were to try to transition to such a labor structure, TENS of MILLIONS of workers would be thrown permanently out of work. From the website \\"Trading Economics\\":  From 1983 until 2010, Italy's Unemployment Rate averaged 9.00 percent reaching an historical high of 11.50 percent in April of 1998 and a record low of 5.70 percent in April of 2007.  From 1983 until 2010, France's Unemployment Rate averaged 9.54 percent reaching an historical high of 11.80 percent in March of 1994 and a record low of 7.30 percent in February of 1983.    If we had these AVERAGE labor statistics in the USA for such a lengthy period we'd have CIVIL WAR!    Now look at Germany and to a lesser extent, Japan. They are enjoying tremendous success exporting high-end machine tools and manufacturing equipment to the PRC and the lesser Asian nations (with which they are bleeding white what little is left of our manufacturing industry). (Japan's economic woes have nothing at all to do with the performance of their export manufacturing sector -- they're purely political, financial, and market woes). Germany and Japan, contrary to the wisdom of our American business \\"experts\\", are not ceding their industrial and information sectors to Asia as are we. It's because of jerks like this guy Pink spouting their \\"post-industrial\\" pollyanna that we've willingly atrophied our industrial capability that will always be in market demand. PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS NEED THINGS! To make things companies need MACHINES. $$$ high-profit high-tech left-brain machines and PEOPLE.    Actually, Pink is worse even than this! Not only are we giving away our industry, but even our information sectors. Just saying as does Pink that we cannot compete with Asia makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy, to the detriment of millions of American workers. It's BS. I cite Fareed Zakaria [[ASIN:0393334805 The Post-American World]] the truth is that the thousands of information professionals being created by Indian and Chinese universities aren't worth spit compared to the capabilities of American graduates. That's just why so many of these foreigners are coming here for their professional educations. One of our technology graduates is worth three of theirs. Don't believe it? There was an episode of the show \\"Global Voices\\" on PBS that told the story of one such import from India. His boss at his US employer was complaining \\"a guy with a masters in CompSci shouldn't be constantly asking so many elementary questions.\\" And the worst part is that our business and government \\"leaders\\" are complicit in this treachery against the American worker.    Now we have the Pink prescription for American dominance of the new Post-Information-Age economy: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning.    Starting with Design: what's new here? The first mass market consumer item was arguably the automobile, specifically the Henry Ford Model T. You could get it in any color you wanted, so long as it was black! Who doesn't remember that? And then comes along General Motors, with a complete range of products tailored for every consumer niche, and they cleaned Ford's clock for a good many years? Hasn't Pink even heard this tired old story? This is material fit for a printed book?? Come on!    Then we have Pink's anecdote about how Design helps improve patient's experiences recovering from illness/surgery in hospitals. Oh boy! What nice decor and lighting, everything's so cheerful I just feel better already!! YET, he neglects the lack of attention by the medical community to the most basic of medical necessities. To wit: the 100,000 or 200,000 (?) MEDICAL MISTAKES that result in needless patient DEATHS injuries illnesses and SUFFERING. I do not want my medical caretakers diddling around with the decor and stylish furnishings -- I want them taking measures to end this negligence and incompetence! And how about doctors and nurses not even bothering to wash their hands and causing needless hospital infections? Not to mention breeding antibiotic-resistant bacteria which threaten entire communities when they spread off the hospital premises. Have we completely lost touch with our proper priorities ???    Then Pink goes on to the decor and atmosphere of our public schools. How about the fact that half our schools are physically, literally FALLING APART ?? How about dimwit apathetic students? Lazy unqualified teachers? Creationists always trying to expel Darwin from the classroom, and sloppy history texts? Students who consistently rank at the bottom of the international rankings? And can't say when the Civil War happened or locate Europe on a map? I'll stop there. How much time, effort, and money do we have to spend on Design in Education ?    Then there's the Designer Toilet Brush and the Designer Toaster. Pink says nobody can compete anymore on Quality or Price because of global hyper-competition, so the only way to get people to buy YOUR stuff is to prettify it into a piece of art, since 90% of the time it just sits around doing nothing so it might as well be nice to look at. WHAT A CHUMP! What about features? New innovative features? Whatever happened to good old fashioned American Ingenuity? Did that fall away with our crumbling public education system? I'm no Designer nor even an Engineer, but here are just a few ideas right off the top of my left-brained head: 1) how about a toilet that cleans itself? Too sci-fi? But why not? Have we become so weak-minded and weak-willed that we cannot even consider the possibility of a self-cleaning toilet? Okay, how about different kinds of bristles that make cleaning easier? How about more effective chemicals that can make washing off the toilet grime effortless? Now for the toaster: how about one that can clean itself of all the crumbs? How about a toaster that can tell the difference between a slice of bread and a bagel? How about one that can recognize little Susie apart from Dad or brother Timmy, and make toast just the way each one of them likes it? How about improved safety features (they CAN start fires, you know).    Basically Pink is talking like the Knights Who Say 'Ni' from Monty Python's Holy Grail: \\"We want...a Toilet Brush!!! (vice Shrubbery) One that looks nice. (Of course) And not too expensive.\\" And then we can all become specialists in fancy toilet brushes: \\"My name is Roger. Roger the Toilet Brusher (vice Shrubber). I design, arrange, and sell Designer Toilet Brushes.\\" To which I rejoin with a hearty \\"Ni Ni Ni !' For chrissakes! IT'S A FRICKING TOILET BRUSH! Am I at last getting through to the 200+ morons who gave this bonfire-worthy book 5-star reviews ??? I say we need MORE left-brain ingenuity, not this airy-fairy right-brain rubbish.    And I find it absolutely disgusting the way Pink so casually and callously dismisses the tens of millions of struggling American workers by his saying that the majority of us enjoy the plentitude of American consumer Nirvana. We are all so filthy rich we can surround ourselves with workaday artistry and endless hours of liesure so cloyingly satisfying that we need to ponder The Search for the Meaning of Life. Tell me how many millions of Americans were thrown out of work (and health benefits) by George W. and the \\"Committee to Save the World\\"? And continue to suffer and struggle. How many families thrown into the street with the ongoing avalanche of mortgage forclosures? How many businesses and inventors/entrepreneurs who cannot survive? How many stalled college educations and graduates drowning in debt? How many consumers who cannot spend because they cannot get credit? Just how many of us feel so rich we can indulge in idleness such as \\"neurotheology\\" as described on page 222? Why, even scientific \\"researchers\\" have concluded that religion can \\"cut people's risk of death\\". Here Pink betrays his utter misunderstanding of even this simple exercise in left-brain thought. He confuses causes with effects, the most rudimentary of errors. Just what is this guy's educational background anyhow? -- English probably, or Liberal Arts or General Studies or some other retarded right-brainer pussy curriculum.    In short, I say it's time to stop whining and roll up our sleeves and get America back to work doing what it does best and what made us great and a World Superpower, (which let's not forget we still are, for the time being at least until the jerks like Pink get their way) -- down to earth Left-Brain innovation and brawn.    But, if you want to know the Real right-brain Killer App, I can say it in one sentence: Interpersonal Relations and Office Politics. Contrary to traditional American wisdom, ability, talent, good ideas, and hard work are not the true keys to career success. It's blunt and uncouth but here is The Truth: it is sucking up to the Boss and schmoozing influential coworker friends. Why cannot the 200+`5-star morons grasp this most basic of social facts that date back to the time when our evolutionary ancestors were MONKEYS? Save yourself some bucks and hours of effort reading, and instead get some good books on interpersonal Machiavellian relations and office politicking. Pink's book is a complete waste of time and as well an act of treason against the rank-and-file American worker.
1936594234|2.0|I actually found this book to be fairly enlightening - but I really had to read between the lines. What I got out of it was that our subconscious minds are immensely susceptible to suggestion from our conscious minds. Whatever we think is true or fear is true consciously, is magnified in our subconscious mind, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to escape. I think this really is a major cause of depression, phobia, and other mental ailments.     But where the author goes wrong is his support of faith healing. Perhaps it is true that people were healed of certain ailments this way, through the power of suggestion, but if so the author does an extremely poor job of arguing for it. His arguments consist entirely of unsupported anecdotes, mostly from the 1800's. Also he relies heavily on the Bible - which does not hold much weight for me as an atheist.     Its just flat out ridiculous that no doctor has ever healed anyone (its all the power of the subconscious) and anything you want can be yours if you just think the right thoughts. Grow up, people. These kind of beliefs cause real harm and suffering. If you are convinced by the shoddy arguments in this book, you need to go back to school.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I enjoy reading this author's books but absolutely refuse to pay more for an e-book than what I could pay in the store for a hardcover.  The publisher needs to get the message that this price is totally unacceptable
B004SBX112|3.0|I gotta admit, this leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Pay money, but don't get updates until 3 days after google? Hardly worth it imo. This isn't the first time Amazon had got me either... I paid 4 bux for an app that was the same FREE app google has at no cost. Amazon needs to communicate better before they think of challenging google.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Very happy with this item, listing to this 24/7    excellent service and prompt delivery.    return costumer
B001DF68MA|2.0|The item is described as being suitable for kids up to 4 years old. My son is just 2 and a half and it was too small- The distance from the seat to the foot holders is just too short, even when they were adjusted to the max. So unless you have a really short 3 or 4 year old, you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, it appears sturdy enough.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I have been counting the days until this movie came out in DVD form. My opinion upon seeing it first in the theater was that it was undoubtedly the best movie I had seen in 20 years - and I haven't changed my mind one iota. I would like to echo the opinion of another reviewer who commented about how refreshing it was to watch a movie that didn't insult his/her intelligence by relying on scene after scene of flashy special effects, eardrum-splitting explosions, silly chases, and cheap vocabulary. Although I had some knowledge of the historical events depicted in the film, I was prompted, after seeing it, to spend several hours researching the history and delving a bit more into the personalities of King George VI, as well as discovering what occured during the remaining years of his reign. Although I'm sure that the abdication of Edward was traumatic for both the royal family as well as the British citizens, I'm convinced that it was truly a \\"blessing in disguise\\" as Edward never had the strength of character and determination that his younger brother had - traits which were absolutely  essential during those dark days before and during World War II.    Colin Furth did a magnificent job portraying King George and his struggle overcoming his stuttering difficulties. One could really see the pain, embarrassment, and frustration on his countenance each time he attempted to talk. But in spite of this, he realized what he needed to do in order to be the kind of King that Great Britan needed, and was willing to expend time and energy to achieve it.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I read The War of Art (Steven's previous book on this subject) last year, and I loved it. Recently I picked up the audiobook and listened it through, and I loved it the second time, too. I have the occasional small disagreement with Pressfield's worldview, but never enough to take issue with his approach -- and The War of Art has been an enormously positive influence on my mindset and my work (over and over). I was excited when I saw that Do the Work was coming down the line, and my feelings on it are almost entirely positive.    An interesting note: As of this writing, all the 1-star reviews for Do the Work are about someone having received this book without ordering it. Some may have hit the pre-order button when the ebook was free and then forgotten; some may in fact have received it as a glitch on Amazon's part. But those negative reviews still have to do with the delivery system, not the actual content of the book. This seems a bad basis for a book review. So my review is about the content. ^_^    I am surprised to have found that it's NOT necessary to read The War of Art before reading Do the Work. Pressfield periodically reflects back to The War of Art for important preceding information (which he repeats, rather than just referencing), and a new reader will enjoy this book just as much if she reads it first instead of second. (I love this, because of course it makes it easier for me to recommend the book to others.) And even as someone who'd read The War of Art originally, the repeated bits (surprisingly!) didn't annoy me; they only served to reinforce the material, which was a nice effect.    Do the Work is like a workbook -- like a seasoned veteran holding your hand through trial and tribulation. Read it from cover to cover, but then pick up any project and let it guide you from beginning to the end. Through Resistance's clutches and out the other side!    Pressfield says in the beginning that Do the Work is created in the parlance of writing, but I'm notsure that warning was needed -- he gives dozens of non-writing-related examples throughout the entire book. He may have started with writing, but from my perspective, the book has very little bias towards writing projects.    A few of my favorite parts throughout: The section on creative panic. His in-depth description of the (imagined) creative crash of Herman Melville on the way to completing Moby Dick. (This made me giggle.) And Pressfield's bit of graduation speech at the end? Quite an excellent experience!    If I have any issue with Do the Work, it's that Pressfield begins by describing the artist's territory as fundamentally adversarial. Later on, it becomes more clear why he might be doing this -- Navy SEALs are put through as much hell as possible early on, to see if they will give up the fight before actual lives are at stake. Is it possible that he is putting the reader in this position, too? Art often IS war. The down and dirty, in-the-trenches, professionals-only quality of The War of Art is why I fell in love with Pressfield a year ago. As Do the Work progressed, I found him just as willing to describe the surprising benefits and creative power of ASSISTANCE as he was to describe the fundamental malignancy and evil of RESISTANCE. So in the end, I was cool with it. It served a purpose.     There is no sugar-coating here. There's LOTS of powerful mojo. Artists are well-served by the warrior mindset, and in the end, Pressfield is creating warriors with this book.
B000FCKBCU|3.0|I'm a big fan of all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This was the last book I needed to read to be caught up with all of her books. Unfortunately, this book is probably my least favorite of her books. The story was kind of boring and predictable and I felt that the ending was a little over-the-top.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My daughter wanted this movie for her birthday.  We couldn't find it in local stores though. She loved it!!
B000002GXS|5.0|These days I find Tom Waits' music to be just too difficult to listen to. I admire the artistry, and recognize his brilliance, but I can't get past those tortured, damaged vocals. The first two records by Waits, on the other hand, are a totally different story. Closing Time was the first real album I bought in my teens. I know every word and note of that beautiful, brilliant work. To think that Waits could actually exceed Closing Time with The Heart of Saturday Night seemed impossible. But he did. Released in 1974 The Heart of Saturday is a perfect record from the rollicking New Coat of Paint to the lovely affecting closers Drunk on The Moon and The Ghosts of Saturday Night. The album is bluesy, gritty but utterly breathtaking in its beauty and scope. There's lots of piano on this one and the sound of resonant, rich upright bass throughout. Bones Howe's production is damn near perfect. The Heart of Saturday Night is essential for any good album collection.
B004SBQAL0|2.0|When i saw the trailer for this movie i was not sure if i would like it or not. But i am the type person to give a movie a chance because i just love movies. So in short, this movie is a let down in every way. The story centers around Number 4 and his protecter, as they constantly are on the run from.... some other... aliens, because...well...who know why but that is the plot of the movie. Number 4's power consist of having flash light hands, and jumping really high...whooo. The first half of the movie is the best when he arrives at his new school and of course tries to lay low. Unfortunately the big bad bullies will see that the new guy will receive his just deserts..for..being...new.. i guess. Then Number 4 falls in love with a girl at his new school and is willing to risk everything for love, but the movies gets real Twilight after that. I am not just saying that because there is a love interest plot, he says things like: \\"Once our kind loves another we love forever.\\" Even though they have know each other for two days. I think that Edward and Number 4 should fight to the death for stupid love movie supremacy. The aliens hunting him are a joke, and i much prefer the cliché bullies to the cookie cutter aliens. Guess what the aliens want....THEY WANT TO RULE THE WORLD!! Imagine that aliens who want to kill everyone and take our planet. The fight scenes sucked, and that was the part i was really looking forward to, but again fell short. In a nut shell if you love yourself stay away from this average, seen it been there done that movie concept.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Even Kings need help sometimes.  This is the true story about King George VI (Firth) and his problems with dealing with a stutter.  After many failed attempts with therapists his wife enlists Lionel Logue (Rush) to help him overcome it.  After Hitler begins to rise, England looks to King George for support.  The stuttering king works to overcome it in order to lead his country.  Knowing that this movie won Best Picture at this years Oscars there is a certain expectation going in.  This movie does not dissapoint and is a very deserving winner of the award.  Colin Firth (who won the Oscar for this movie) does an amazing job, and much like Christian Bale in \\"The Fighter\\", without Firth this would not be half as good.  After all the talk and hype most movies dissapoint when you finally watch them (especially when you are one of the last ones to see it).  This is one of the few exceptions, it is as good or better then you have heard.  For a movie about speech therapy it moves pretty quick and is very entertaining to watch.  This is one not to be missed.  Movie and acting are both great.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Definatly, I would.  This is one to buy.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Its a normal ps2 memory card. if you only have like 10 games this is good. but if you have 25+ you should probibly get a 64mb
B004SBX112|1.0|I love this game as well as the original and Rio. Funny thing is, this gets updated to Easter on the most important day of the year for me. My wedding anniversary, my wife loves angry birds BTW, and the ''unofficial'' global holiday ;)
B004SBS8LA|2.0|it worked great but now does not even open . i am using a moto droid. give me my angry birds back! other versions of the game (ad versions ) work just fine
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is more of a workbook - a way to get you through your own work or creative block. It is fast paced and well written. I read it in about 30 minutes- but will go back to it over and over again for help with, well, life. Great read.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|It seems like I waited forever to get this item, even though when I was tracking it, it had been in my home town for 3 days, just didn't show up at my house until a few hours ago. As I watching this DVD, it started skipping, just a little at first and then so badly that I had to skip entire scenes... I'm very upset that after I spent money on this DVD and waited for it to arrive, all I got was a DVD that skipped. I could barely watch it. I would not recommend this DVD to anybody. Go buy it at the store, which is what I now have to do...
B004SBX112|2.0|I would like to know when Amazon plans to allow this app to be updated? Why would anyone pay for the apps if we have to wait for Amazon to push the update throukegh whenever they like.  Okay so I understand that they are making sure that the apps are up to snuff. But let's face this version of Angry Birds depends on timely releases.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|This is a bit of an odd request- last week I returned my Bob Dylan dvd as the quality was pathetic (among other things), and am still waiting for my refund.<br />Btw- postage was $4.50 au.<br />Today (1 week later), I want to buy the dvd called Schindlers List, and I can't seem to find ANY copy that will play in Australia.<br />Can you help- maybe a swap can be arranged- if that is not too late.<br />I would prefer new condition; don't mind waiting.<br />Awaiting your reply<br />S Cameron.
B0034G4OY0|4.0|Well acted and written story. It certainly contains a few twists and turns but comes together in the end. My family liked it.
B004SBX112|5.0|If you crybabies would pay attention the update is out. I have never seen such a sad group of whiners in my life. Rovio said it was their fault so you blame Amazon and Rovio. Sometimes these things happen,calm down people. I love angry birds but its just a game. Big deal you had to wait 2 days. I promise you will survive.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have no complaints about the movie but,I have only seen it in the theater. The Harry Potter that I PRE- ORDERED still has not arrived. I guess that I was under the assumption that pre-ordering was a plus. NOT SO!
1400079144|2.0|Is it possible for a novel to be can't-put-downable yet preposterous, even maddening at the same time? With \\"The Lost Symbol\\", the answer is undeniably yes. Fast paced yet redundant, insightful yet constantly tripping over its ridiculously excessive use of symbology, Brown's latest is the quintessential metaphor about eating lots of empty calories and even feeling a bit queasy afterward. Oh, and Dan Brown is an author with such annoying habits, like : something incredible happens in one chapter - and then later on he spends pages retroactively explaining how it happened; dozens upon dozens of chapters that end in a variation of \\"He couldn't believe what he was seeing\\" (something we'll get to see several pages later); tons and tons of exposition on symbology, history and whatnot - often while characters are caught in a life-or-death situation; etc.    Would I recommend it? Only to die hard fans of the genre, and even then, I'd say lower your expectations.
B004ISVH6G|5.0|John is back and in a major way!  Like a fine wine, he has certainly gotten better with age.  His signature \\"voice\\" is still very much in tact and his band locks in real tight with him.  I can't recommend this enough.  The first listen will convince you of this 5 star rating.  The title track is my personal fav (at the moment).  Very strong on all fronts (performance, production, etc...).  Thank you John for delivering this masterpiece.  Check him out live if he comes to your area (heck, travel to see him if you can as you won't be disappointed).

B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is one hour and four minutes and was released in theaters on October 23, 1941. Dumbo was the shortest film to date until Saludos Amigos came out in August of 1942. Dumbo basically the movie tells the story of a baby elephant born with birth defect, big ears. He is seen as an outcast from his fellow elephants; the children make fun of him, and the circus clown make fun of him. His mother is put in cage for protecting him. Dumbo's only friend is a mouse; real name is Timothy Q. Mouse. It is only with the help of Timothy and the crows (and the magic feather) that they convince Dumbo that he can fly. In the end Dumbo has the last laugh on the people who hurt him.    Dumbo won the Academy Award in 1942 for Original Music Score. Because Fantasia and Pinocchio were financial flops, the movie was made using watercolor backgrounds and paint. The movie cost around $800,000 and made almost twice as during its release. One other thing to note, on the DVD disc in the Casey Jr. sing-along song, it is a combination of the Dumbo movie and the short call The Brave Engineer. Dumbo is one of Disney's finest movies ever made and gets an AAAAA+++++.    DVD FEATURES    Chapter Selection  Set Up  Bonus Features  A. Audio Commentary  B. \\"Baby Mine\\" Music Video  C.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|I was pleased with the vid. Saw it at the movies and enjoyed it had to have it the special features were great don't know how the FEW that gave it bad reviews can be content that they were giving a fair review, but it was just thier opinion.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|Two lovers in Japan sat on a strawberry swing and thought of the cemetaries of london for 42 minutes straight, thinking one day we'll go to London, so we can viva la vida, and say no to death and all his friends. Oh, and we'll live our lives in technicolor! The lovers in japan said yes, we should go, but let's get a map so we won't be lost!and end up at violet hill instead. Heh, corny story, but VIVA is like one long, elaborate adventure that you wish would never end. The songs on here never get old, and I just keep playing them over and over.<br />Each song is special, so picking a favorite's like saying pick your favorite child, or would you rather be deaf or blind? As far as I'm concerned, there is no filler song on this CD. Each one's equally good, and it's almost impossible to sit still while listening to a Viva La Vida. You just want to get up and try to conquer the world, any way you can. While the song Viva La Vida got the most radio play, all these songs are worth listening to. If I could only have one CD on my ipod, I'd probably pick this.
B004FOA84A|2.0|It seems like a cool game, when it works. I'm having problems with it force closing about 50 percent of the time. I uninstalled it which was too bad since I just bought it a few days ago.
B000TENKEK|5.0|ME: (Singing)Are we the last living souls? Are we the last living souls? Are we the last to get away?<br />FRIEND: Err...no.<br />ME:(blush)<br />Oh, wait, so this isn't the appocolypse? Oh, my mistake! If you listen to Demon days too much, you might just convince yourself it's time to stock up on flashlight batteries. It's the stranges album I've listened to with crossovers from every genre on it. You would self destruct trying to classify this thing. It's not even alternative, but it certainly is brilliant.<br />I will warn that it takes time to get into. At first, I actually disliked some of the songs, because I didn't understand what they were trying to say. The next thing I know, the CD becomes an obsession and my ipod's playing it in a constant loop.<br />Most people know Feel Good Inc, but Demon Days has much more to offer. A must listen!
B002G4FQAC|5.0|I can't recall the title of any of the songs on the first two albums, but I liked them enough to purchase this masterpiece. Great Rock&Roll, with loud guitars, drums a bangin', and one of the best voices in music providing the vocals. The ballads are also really well done, of course particularly, The Only Exception. The album is remarkably well balanced and exciting. My favorite rock album of the last decade was Fallen, by Evanescence, but this is definately a close second.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|There are already many reviews applauding this series so I'll just say that this is good corny, cheesy, bucket of popcorn fun for the whole family. I love this instant classic. A must have!!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|No room for anything other than ABSOLUTE praise for this album.  Adele has such an amazing pure voice.  I liked her first album but this one is pure gold.  Cannot stop listening and the songs have permeated my life so that they are constantly playing in my head.  All my other albums are feeling neglected because this is the only one playing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not a phone game person, but this game is fun and addictive. I went back and picked up the original after downloading Rio and this game is better, IMO.

630521610X|5.0|This truly is my favorite film of all time. I love the creativity and originality of the film. Truly a masterpiece.    The product itself is indeed fine. The only drawback is the picture size (kinda small). Other than that, this is pure entertainment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The more I listen the more I like it but I can't tell you why.  It is sonically very interesting but I often don't know what to make of it.  The album is challenging but quite possibly brilliant.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|Watched it on TV on Movies on Demand.  No problems.  Great sound, great picture.  Don't know what people are complaining about.  Also, I didn't find it \\"darker\\" at all; in fact, a lot less so that previous versions.

0670022411|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it was an easy read.  I didn't give it a full five stars because I thought it dragged a little in some parts.  The author could have compacted a little more. Overall,  great book and I am looking forward to the next one.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|This is a good headset with great sound and even has some nice feature.    although there are lots of things good and bad.    Pros-  Thick cable  good quality sound  stero sound      Cons-  severly uncomfortable this is the issue i returned then they hurt your hears if you plan on playing more than 30 minutes at a time.  buzzing in the back round, there is always a constant buzz   stero expander makes for a disadvantage
0439023521|5.0|You just can not put it down!  I had to start reading the next book right away! It is just awesome! A unique story!
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey on TV is (in my humble opinion) brilliant, funny, personable and multi-talented. I expected the book to be funny, but not also so full of truths for women, men and everyone else who she mentions who fall somewhere in-between those specific and precise genders.<br /><br />Immediately she let you know that she is not sparing anyone - her mother or her friends or anyone she has known over time or currently knows. She is quick to throw praise and humorous anecdotes out that are funny and so easy for most anyone who grew up in the past 40-50+ years to identify with and remember. She is not shy (which did not surprise me) to use the kind of language that most people who enjoy Tina Fey and also like SNL and 30 Rock must assume that those who act with her or who are her friends use with regularity on the set, at parties or in telephone conversations with each other. It is the honest language and the honest statements of how she viewed herself growing up and currently, that make this more than just a very funny book. She is candid and very willing to point out her strengths and what she sees or has been told are her weaknesses. And she does it with humor and lightness boldness.<br /><br />This book is a great mood lifter for any woman (and men, and people who are not sure where they fall within that spectrum), because Tina includes all kinds of people in her recollection of her younger years and in telling how she really feels about her current day-to-day life. I laughed all through this book, and admired the way this very quick witted woman told her story with many inserted \\"side comments,\\" keeping me wanting to go to the next page and chapter. I knew she was a smart and funny and a very talented woman. This book simply reinforced what I already thought and then some. If I am ever very sick or even dying, I would watch old classic comedies and read books like this to make me forget my troubles and lift my spirits. It really is a very clever, well written, very funny book.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|The film by itself is an intriguing proposal about what if you make a decision instead another one. So, when you decide to make a decision a set of unchained events will undertake, but perhaps they are very related. Reality or existential fiction. In last instance, the destiny is the way you live.<br /><br />Of course, there have been many others related films, in which \\"The butterfly effect\\" the randomness and the destiny's trickeries are extremely united. A man close to death ponders the many lives he might have led in this fantasy from director and screenwriter Jaco van Dormael. 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is ill and facing his last days as he looks back on his past and a particular crucial moment -- at the age of nine, Nemo's parents divorced, and as his mother (Natasha Little) and father (Rhys Ifans) stood on a train platform, he had to choose who he would go with, and whether he would live in the United States or Great Britain. Either choice would bring with it a wide variety of possibilities regarding the sort of life he would lead, and Nemo imagines nearly all of them, including two different wives -- sweet but emotionally blank Jeanne (Linh-Dan Pham) and lovely but troubled Elise (Sarah Polley) -- and another woman, Anna (Diane Kruger), whom he loves but can not marry. But as Nemo considers the many different paths his life could have taken, his memory begins to fail him, and he finds it increasingly difficult to be certain which was his real life and which is a product of his imagination. Mr. Nobody also stars Thomas Byrne as nine-year-old Nemo and Toby Regbo as Nemo in his teenage years.<br /><br />The initial sequence is a marvelous tribute to 2001 Space Odyssey's last shots.  marvelous artistic, superb edition and magnificent performance of Jared Leto make this film a winner. Don't let it pass.
B0012CH350|5.0|Works great but get ready to do some experimenting.  A lot of \\"touch and feel\\" needed to get good results.
0439023513|3.0|Spoilers ahead:    I think the main problem people have with this book (me included) is the fact that the book resolves everything too quickly.  Nevermind the point of the uselessness of the assassination mission or abrupt death of Prim or even the half-drugged state Katniss is in the last 15% of the book.  I can forget about all those things if the book just resolved well.    The resolution between Katniss and Peeta just lacked oomph.  We go through so much of the book with Peeta hating Katniss and then slowly changing but never trusting.  And then towards the end, they just magically let time heal their wounds and get back together?  Fine, but at least explain some of that.      I can understand that Katniss can never return to a state of peace again in her life after everything she's gone through, but at least spend some time developing her life after, or leave it up to us for us to discern.  Don't leave us with something that was edited in last minute.

B004R13U6Y|3.0|I have a lot of pdf's that require me to zoom in and out constantly (trail maps, diagrams, etc.).  I tried out this app to see if it would be quick in zooming in and out because the Adobe reader app took 2-3 seconds to display whenever I zoomed.  This app would load up instantly an initially blurry display of the zoomed area and then take upto 10 seconds to display it clearly.  No good for me.    Other features of the app are nice but I primarily wanted a pdf reader that could zoom in and out with easy.  Adobe Reader is still the quickest.  This app was too slow for such a task.
1936719010|5.0|Steven Pressfield loves his reader enough to be perfectly honest.  The book is short, because Mr. Pressfield gives you the crucial information you lack, then expects you to GET TO WORK.<br /><br />Like his indispensable The War of Art, Do the Work gives the writer/artist a taser jolt to the lazy, deceptive, self-indulgent, fearful part of herself that keeps her from achieving her dream.  I owe Mr. Pressfield a great debt, and now I will end this review and GET TO WORK paying it forward.
0439023491|5.0|As trilogies go, second books tend to just die off but Catching Fire just continues everything nicely.  No slowdowns.  Just continues off where the first book ended and keeps pushing all the elements of the first book far and beyond.  Katniss/Peeta relationship continues to be expanded.  Introduction of new characters that you really feel for come about.  Great read.

On the other hand if you feel stuck or like you have hit a road block in your life and you are not sure about what to do next. This will give you the needed inspiration to keep moving. Get ready to fuel your tank with a little bit of high octane energy. This book will move you to action.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year.  I beg Deborah Harkness to write a second book with the same characters telling us what happens.

0307272702|1.0|How does anyone really believe this stuff?   Sure, it is obvious that some people do store fat more readily than others... but are there REALLY that many people in America who are so handicapped?   Some of what he says makes sense...  we all know already that sugar and refined carbs are bad, because of the insulin reaction and the lack of real nutrition.   But, please, people, THINK!!  There are far fewer fat people in other countries than in America.  And virtually all of them eat a pretty balanced diet, with plenty of carbs.  The main reason most of them are not as fat as we are is because they are not as sedentary.   Like the movie \\"Wall-E\\" indicated, it is our entertainment-based, remote control lifestyle, with plenty of snacks and plenty of encouragement to buy more snacks, that keeps us putting on the pounds, year after year.      Fat people will love this book.  All they seem to look for is another excuse for being the way they are.   But let me ask...  how many people do you know that have lost weight on the Atkins diet?  I myself know quite a few.  My friends lost a lot of weight on that diet... and gained it all back and then some.  Your body will crave carbs because it needs carbs.  You cannot go on the rest of your life without them.  BUT you can choose to feed it good carbs-- whole grains, fruit, legumes.  These foods were made for your body, and your body was made to thrive on them, along with the protein and other nutrients.   If you plant a vegetable garden, and stay away from the TV/computer and grocery stores, you will undoubtedly find yourself by the end of summer quite a few pounds lighter, and considerably happier, than if you follow Mr. Taubes's advice.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|This might be one of the most intensely bizarre movies I have ever seen. Completely original and flat out amazing.<br /><br />The screenplay is difficult to review without giving away the entire plot. I haven't read all the submissions, so I can only presume some spoiling jackass has already done so. And what a tragedy for anyone who hasn't yet seen this powerful film.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to be free from any spoilers as I was: Old Boy is completely original (how many times can you honestly say that about a film?), independently creative, performed meticulously and is deliciously twisted.<br /><br />Top marks in every category that I can think of - and well worth the full purchase price. Don't even blink if a clean used copy is available - buy it.<br /><br />One important note: Absolutely do not get the dubbed version. So much emotion, so much power is felt thru the original Korean dialogue.<br /><br />A full five stars with no qualifiers. One of the best dramas I have ever seen.

B00008G9JM|4.0|I've read that some people love Passion Play and hate Thick As A Brick, or vice versa.  Well if you're reading this and trying to decide whether to buy Passion Play, I would say that it is very similar to Thick As A Brick, and maybe a bit better.  For me, their crowning achievement was Aqualung, which had a good mix of hard rock and folksy stuff.  TAAB and Passion Play do not have the catchy hard-rock bits of Aqualung, but both have their redeeming features.  I think they both grow on you, but will never have the power of My God or Locomotive Breath.  I guess Ian didn't want to get stuck in a rut, so opted to change his style every couple of years.  Passion Play is good, but not great.  I'm still looking for a great album from the 70s that I somehow missed.  Is there something out there that is as good as Machine Head, or Aqualung, that somehow missed mass radio airplay??

B004LWZVZC|4.0|Once again, the young actor JAMES McAVOY gives an earnest and altogether convincing portrait of a man assigned to be the defense lawyer for Mary Surratt, accused as one of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Since the whole story is told from his point of view (and Redford's), it emerges as a somewhat biased look at how events might have unfolded, but taking no firm stand on the innocence or guilt of the accused. As the nation mourns the sudden death of its leader taken from them just as the Civil War ended, we are told that justice must be swift to heal the wounds of the public and satisfy a thirst for revenge. It's that viewpoint that makes this film relevant today, in view of other controversial historical events, but first and foremost the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.<br /><br />One glaring quibble: Apparently, to fully immerse the viewer in this time of history and to suit the flavor of the grim tale, Redford has chosen to use very muted color photography so that this is almost a sepia tone experience. But do we have to be reminded so flagrantly that this was the candlelit era? Scenes outside of the courtroom could have used flashes of real color, as could the social circle interiors of other scenes instead of keeping the low-key lighting so constant. It became a distraction for me. He may as well have used glorious B&W.<br /><br />Other technical aspects are fine and the background score is effective without becoming overwhelming. ROBIN WRIGHT PENN plays Mary Surratt with quiet dignity and strength. KEVIN KLINE is almost unrecognizable as the stubbornly determined EDWIN STANTON seeking quick justice, EVAN RACHEL WOOD is effective as the distraught daughter Anna Surratt, and JOHNNY SIMMONS is sobering as the accused woman's son who manages to escape imprisonment for his role in the John Wilkes Booth caper. However, his character and motives are not fleshed out at all by the script, nor is his key relationship with his mother, Mary Surratt made at all clear.<br /><br />Biggest supporting role goes to TOM WILKINSON as the man who urges McAvoy to take the defense case against his wishes. He and McAvoy share most of the running time on screen and do magnificent jobs.<br /><br />History buffs will no doubt find this more interesting than the average movie fan looking for a more adventurous look at the past, but it is competently made, despite some flaws, and does recreate the actual events in a satisfying manner by use of flashbacks and an intelligent script. But did it have to be so dark?y Surratt made at all clear.    Biggest supporting role goes to TOM WILKINSON as the man who urges McAvoy to take the defense case against his wishes.

B003Y5H55Q|1.0|Atheist Paul<br /><br />So, this is a heads up to all of you who do not want to be sucker punch for your Christianity. Paul was advertised as a comedy about a couple of Science-Fiction nerds who take a road trip and run into an space alien who needs their help. Sounds like this could be a fun movie. The advertising and trailers has nothing to do with Christian bashing. So I go and hope that this will be a fun movie but what I get is sucker punched. The movie goes way beyond the usual Hollywood slap in the face toward Christianity. The first slap comes when one of the characters is represented as a low life, gun toting, Christian fanatic. The sucker punch comes when Greg Mottola represents the Hero of his movie Paul, as a highly intelligent alien who has a deep emotional hatred directed against Christianity. Paul's dialog goes out of its way to evokes feelings of hatred toward Christian and Christianity throughout the movie while promoting Atheism in a positive light. I was not surprised with the low life, gun toting, Christian fanatic character because that is a given but I was surprise at the underlining attack on Christian's and Christianity in such an angry, hateful way. I know for those of you who are not Christian will not see it this way. You have no value in Christianity and that is OK with me because that is what free will is all about. You have a right to your decision that determines your fate as I do for my decision. All I ask is that we respect each other decision. Greg Mottola hides the fact that he used his movie to promote his atheist beliefs by attacking Christianity because he knew that fact would hurt his bottom line and that is not OK.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I was absolutely mesmerized by this show the first season. Second season was still amazing, Third season kind of dropped a bit, and I waited to get the fourth season. While it's not quite up to the home run of the original season, it's solidly good.     When you finish, HBO has a preview of the first episode of season 5 up online. It gives me the impression that a lot of season 4 was the harbinger of what's to come in season 5, because it blew my socks off, and I wasn't even wearing socks at the time.
0316056863|1.0|Tina Fey is egotistical to be likable, too pretentious to be funny and too unattractive to be worthy of attention when humour & charisma fail (which they did).. so why did she write a memoir? No one likes you, Tina, except women's magazine editions. For comedians who are not an embarrassment to women, focus your attention to Kathy Griffin, Sandra Bernhard and Margaret Cho.<br /><br />For shame... just retire already.
B000V698WE|1.0|What's with everyone saying this album was Coltrane's message to God? Random saxophone noise is random saxophone noise, nothing more than that, so don't pretend this album is something it is clearly not. The \\"songs\\" have no verse, chorus or melody; they're really just recordings of a bunch of guys goofing around with their instruments. Listening to this album with even an open mind will just leave you shrugging your shoulders and asking \\"...is that it?\\". Plus, where are the vocals? Surely that would make the album more enjoyable. For jazz that is enjoyable to a larger, more intelligent audience, check out Michael Buble, Diana Krall, Norah Jones or Kenny G, and ignore the senseless noodlings of Coltrane, Monk, Mingus and Coleman.
B000V698DI|4.0|Nirvana's debut album \\"Bleach\\" was undoubtedly their worst effort, which was nothing but a Mudhoney (who sucked) ripoff. They tried to fit in with the Seattle grunge scene, but it wasn't meant to be. Nirvana's true calling was MTV music videos, selling out stadiums and forever having songs for teenage boys to play on guitar, and that's why they're so great! \\"Nevermind\\" is not only full of catchy songs with angst-ridden lyrics, but Nirvana ended up having a lot of cool t-shirts sold at Hot Topic, so it's win-win. Also, avoid their later works because Kurt started name-dropping Leonard Cohen (ugh) and covered lame bands like Meat Puppets.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|My grandma owns this CD.<br />Just think about it for a second.<br />She's 82.<br /><br />Shouldn't that be enough of a reason not to listen to The Beatles? People who experienced \\"\\"Beatlemania\\"\\" are probably living in retirement homes by now. Unless you were brainwashed by your parents that this is \\"real music\\", there is simply no logical reason to buy this album. Why do people choose to live in the past, while wonderful pop music is being created today? Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Mika and Bruno Mars are creating groundbreaking music as we speak. Get with the times. Lyrics like \\"she loves you yeah yeah yeah\\" and \\"all you need is love love yeah love is all you need\\" are mindless and something that would be heard on television shows for children.. check out Bruno Mars' \\"Just The Way You Are\\" for lyrics that are truly empowering, something that John Lennon himself would be envious of.
B003L77TZI|5.0|With songs about drug addiction, living a teenage dream, getting trashed and living in California, it's safe to say that Katy's lyrics have reached a new level of depth since her 2008 hit \\"I Kissed a Girl\\". Exploring lyrical themes that are both philosophic and enlightening, it's safe to say that she has cemented her status as one of this decade's most masterful poets (along with Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Enrique Iglesias, Wiz Khalifa & Chris Brown). Lyrical musings aside, \\"Teenage Dream\\" is full of catchy pop tunes that are, in fact, so good that they've been dominating the Top 40 radio airwaves for awhile now. With no sign of slowing down, I suggest that Brian Wilson & Paul McCartney (McFartney) step aside so Katy can take their so-called \\" living legend\\" title.
B001OGLSBE|1.0|\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is not cool enough for hipsters to enjoy (at least non-ironically), not mainstream enough for soccer moms to enjoy, just awkward.

For music that is both artistically and commercially satisfying, check out Jason Mraz, Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.
0316069353|4.0|Good story. I think there was some character steering going on that was as important as the story though. The other Lincoln Lawyer books had more of an on the street feel, this was a courtroom book. Read more like a Grisham book, thats a compliment to most. I'm a fan of Connelly's and his characters, this was worth reading just to keep current.
B004P9FAK2|3.0|I remember when these versions were first announced to launch they would included extended versions of the movies. First two came out, had a few minutes each of extra footage and we were excited for the rest to come out. I wasn't too surprised there was only a little extra in 1 & 2 since the books were tiny as well. I was very disappointed when the release of 3 & 4 had no extra footage. As the books got bigger, more and more of the story was left out. Many of us, undoubtedly were excited about seeing more of the books brought to life. Take \\"Goblet of Fire\\" for example. We all read the play-by-play of the Quidditch Cup and I, for one, would have loved to have seen more of the game in action. Or how about Quidditch being cancelled in OOTP, maybe when they learn to apparate, etc... Too many things we were anticipating in the extended versions are disheartening to know we'll never see.    I had planned on purchasing the Ultimate Editions for movies 3-8 as they became available but I see no reason to spend the extra money on a little bit more bonus content.  Yes, they will still get my money, but not as much (and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way). As it stands I can upgrade my standard dvd's to blu-ray for $10 each (already have Deathly Hallows on Blu-Ray) as opposed to the $30 for each Ultimate Edition. With many of us feeling the same way, that will add up to quite a loss for WB.

0142000671|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a novella by the great American writer John Steinbeck.  Somehow, I avoided reading this very short work through my years of public education and over the course of 1-2 hours recently rectified the omission, in the course of which, I realized that I had seen a cartoon adaption of the leading characters (\\"I used to have a friend.  I petted him and squeezed him and he don't move no more.\\")<br /><br />The book is the tale of two California drifters, George and Lenny; George being the brains behind the duo and simple minded Lenny, a huge beast of a man, the brawn.  The two men show up at a Salinas valley farm as day laborers, bringing in the barley harvest in an effort to \\"raise a stake\\" for purchase of their own small farm.  Here we meet a collection of characters, richly drawn by Steinbeck, whose interaction lays the foundation for this excellent tale.<br /><br />I compare this work very favorably with Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, a novella of comparable length and quality.  Both are quite short, yet very powerful in the emotions they stir in the reader.
B004PGO25O|5.0|\\"Do the Work\\" is a surprisingly helpful book on how to get started on and complete that dream project of yours.  Pressfield tells his readers that \\"Do the Work\\" is \\"designed to coach you through a project from conception to finished product, seeing it from the point of view of Resistance.\\"  This is an excellent one-sentence summary of the book!  Not only is \\"Do the Work\\" a very encouraging work: it's also a very practical and easy to read How To book.  Often, books are big on cheerleading and short on practical wisdom: this book has both!<br /><br />But \\"Do the Work\\" is much more than just another self-help book.  Seth Godin and his Domino Project have set out to revolutionize what a book, publishing, and influence mean.  \\"Do the Work\\" is the latest addition to this daring and innovative project.  Though it may not seem like it to some of you, \\"Do the Work\\" by Stephen Pressfield, is actually a radical work - or, more properly, the result of a radical work: the re-definition of the book.<br /><br />How does \\"Do the Work\\" manifest this revolution in publishing?  For starters, this \\"book\\" was free!  By now, many of us are used to books coming in the form of e-books.  But the potential for e-books to transform the publishing world is already present: a book like \\"Do the Work,\\" and especially the Domino Project push this revolution further and faster.  While a book like \\"Do the Work\\" is relatively short, that (along with its free cost) is actually a strength, once you've learned to think of how books, publishing, and influence all work differently in the digitally connected world.  I'm reading \\"Do the Work\\" largely because it's free, but I'm also reading it because it's relatively short and to the point.  I'm benefiting from it because it has a lot of sound practical advice about how to start and complete the important projects in my life.<br /><br />But I'm also aware that by reading \\"Do the Work\\" for free I'm volunteering to be a part of Seth Godin's \\"tribe.\\"  \\"Do the Work,\\" therefore is about much more than just helping me learn how to start and complete projects: it's indirectly teaching me about the way that things work in the new digital world.  As a teacher, priest, and writer who hopes to influence people, this aspect of the book and Project should not be ignored.<br /><br />\\"Do the Work,\\" in fact begins with an Forward by Seth Godin that we are all now connected to a publishing platform that can connect us to anyone, anytime and that levels the playing field.  And now it's time to do the work.<br /><br />Pressfield names the \\"enemies\\" of the work we wish to do, and there is power in naming:<br />1.  Resistance (which may take the form of fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego, self-loathing, and perfectionism).<br />2.  Rational thought<br />3.  Friends and family<br /><br />The activities or projects that will most elicit Resistance are those that reject immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth.  Pressfield has hit upon an important universal truth here.  For example, Henry Hazlitt \\"Economics on One Easy Lesson\\" basically makes the same point: we hurt ourselves and other economically by acting for short-term instead of long-term gain.<br /><br />Pressfield guides his reader through some of the characteristics of Resistance, because, again, there is power in naming our enemies.  The paradoxical thing is that we can use Resistance because it always keeps pointing to the very thing we want to and should be doing!<br /><br />Just as we have enemies, we also have Allies: stupidity, stubbornness, blind faith, passion, assistance, and friends and family.  Some of these seem counterintuitive, but this is precisely why \\"Do the Work\\" is such a valuable book: it helps us to see truths that are right under our noses but which we can't accept because they are either invisible or they don't fit into or worldview.<br /><br />All of the above comes from the first section of the book: ORIENTATION: ENEMIES AND ALLIES<br /><br />In the remainder of the book, Pressfield attacks the specific parts of starting and completing any project: BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END.  Rather than giving away the details as I have for the section on \\"Orientation,\\" I'll let you discover for yourself how powerful Press field's ideas are.<br /><br />I came to \\"Do the Work\\" expecting to find a fluff piece, worth the price I paid for it: free.  Instead, I found something that's not only taught me about working on projects but has taught me about influence and the way things work in the new digital world.  As Godin and Pressfield hoped, I find that this is a book I want to share others.  And that's how things work in the new digital world.tacks the specific parts of starting and completing any project: BEGINNING, MIDDLE, and END.

0316056863|5.0|IMO this autobiographical book is best appreciated by Tina Fey fans like myself as it is laced with her brilliant humor and is very referential to her life and career track.  So if you are not a SNL fan, or haven't seen Mean Girls [[ASIN:B001QU9RTS Mean Girls [Blu-ray]]] or followed her 30 Rock [[ASIN:B002GP5VLK 30 Rock: Seasons 1-3]] series, then you need to check them out because not only are they great but it will also give you a deeper appreciation of her creativity.<br /><br />This book is a laugh out-loud funny but also gives the reader insightful information on breaking barriers, good management techniques and how the male-dominated world of comedy works.  Tina is a trooper and spent her time in the trenches before breaking into the big time.  I have always respected Loren Michaels but now even more so after reading Tina's experiences with him as boss, mentor and friend.<br /><br />And as for the author, her often self-deprecating humor, subtle observations and amazing intelligence have combined give the reader insights into her upbringing, her love life and successful marriage, and her amazing career as a performer, writer, producer and director. She is indeed the queen of comedy in my book and I urge you to get this book today!

0865479186|4.0|This is a good book, and a good debunking of much \\"sciency\\" stuff that tries to masquerade itself as \\"scientifically proven.\\" And which sadly apparently intelligent people fall into believing.<br /><br />It particularly skewers homeopathy, nutritionists, Gillian McKeith, Patrick Holford and Matthias Rath. It then skewers Big Pharma for the incompleteness of the evidence it presents to doctors who then are then prescribing medicines with only part of the picture about their good and bad points. He's superb at skewering the scientific record, and its deliberately created gaps (unreported negative studies, company suppression of critical papers etc.) He's good at skewering the newspapers and TV journalists for their distortion of scientific evidence, and their inability to understand what they are reporting on, and their higher level ignorance that there's even a problem needing sorted here.<br /><br />In other words this is a good book on our cognitive failings (as is [[ASIN:1846270731 Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error]]), and how easily we are being misled.<br /><br />I cannot help but feel that Goldacre comes over as an intellectual Roundhead. In [[ASIN:0413775275 1066 & All That: 75th Anniversary Edition (Methuen Humour)]] the authors summarise the English Civil War as being between the Roundheads who are \\"right, but repulsive\\" and the Cavaliers who are \\"wrong, but romantic.\\" In this I suspect that Goldacre is an example of the problems experts have at present- namely that, for an example, in the media a man with a lab in his garden shed can be held up as an equal expert to a professor in a large department in a well established university. This is roughly as silly as equating an amateur footballer with David Beckham. Yet it happened over the MRSA scare (Chapter 15 of the book). Meanwhile romantic and free floating pseudo-experts float pretty, \\"sciency\\" but wrong explanations throughout the world with the aid of much marketing, little true research and less ethics.<br /><br />I think Goldacre uses reason well in this book, and it is a necessary enterprise and corrective. Whether people will thank him for it, or prefer the false alternatives remains to be seen.<br /><br />But this is a good book and the targets he skewers fully deserve their skewering.Goldacre uses reason well in this book, and it is a necessary enterprise and corrective.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|I'll admit that I went into this film expecting just another stupid vampire film.  Like zombies in video games, every big film these days just has to have vampires and it's all thanks to Twilight and Friends.  It has become the comedy staple of many satires (including the horribly made Vampires Suck) and online parodies that makes any member of the general audience just roll their eyes when they hear about a film coming out about vampires.  Because of this established norm, my friends and I scheduled a movie night hoping to heckle or \\"riff\\" the hell out of Let Me In just like we had done with Sharktopus the week prior.<br /><br />When the credits rolled and we all looked at each other, we made the startling observation that we had not really done any riffing at all.  We got a few jabs in early on during the opening scene in the hospital (they were Dirty Harry references BTW), but they quickly began to trail off as the film went on.  We began to get drawn into the film and soon the entire audience, myself included, just watched the film intently.  We enjoyed it, thoroughly and couldn't believe what had just transpired.<br /><br />The film has a very basic premise, forbidden love between a bullied preteen kid and a girl vampire (this ISN'T a spoiler as it's written in the description and on the back of the box).  It kinda reminds me of any Disney film pertaining to forbidden love but much, much, MUCH more graphic.  Definitely not for kids (the falling body parts in the pool at the end of the film put this one over the top for an \\"R\\" rating).  The love part isn't overdone like it is in Twilight and the characters are real people, not hairless musclebound teenagers that use any excuse to take their shirts off.  It's a cute little love story.<br /><br />Now, normally I am very black and white on villains, killers, moral vagrants, etc. in that I believe one must atone for their mistakes in one way or another.  However, despite the vampire character randomly attacking and killing innocent people, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.  She is no more guilty than an alligator taking a victim that got too close to the water in a swamp.  It also adds to the character development of both the boy (I never could remember names) and the vampire as they struggle with this horrific truth and try to go on with their lives.  It kept us reeled in.<br /><br />Now, I did not see the original so I cannot comment on whether it is better, worse, or about the same.  While I never pass up a good foreign film such as Das Boot, My Sassy Girl (the Korean version), or any good anime, this one slipped under my radar.  Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, I was very impressed with this one.  I might actually show my girlfriend this one and that's a big deal since I've only shown her my favorites.  Well worthy of viewing for anyone... except children.I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.

B004NSULHM|1.0|Ever since I heard their debut \\"Pablo Honey\\", I've been listening to all of their other albums in hope it will be as great. Sadly, I've been disappointing time and time again; \\"King of the Limbs\\" is no exception. It sounds like a rough take, like something has yet to be added into the mix to give songs that oomph. I suggest that Radiohead ditch the weird, experimental route and go back to what they were best at: guitar driven, catchy post-grunge tunes. \\"Pablo Honey\\" was also their greatest effort because it was the most successful; how often do you hear \\"Creep\\" on the radio in comparison to, say, \\"Lotus Flower\\"?<br /><br />Think about it.<br /><br />I don't even think KOTL made it on MTV.

B003AO1SVS|1.0|First, what's with the ridiculous album cover? It's like The Black Keys are just trying to be ironic by making it on Microsoft Paint. Pretentious. They're the kind of band who rely on \\"mainstream\\" hipsters and Twitter for their fanbase, and the kind of guys who wear glasses without the frames. The music itself is quite difficult to stomach. The fuzzy vocals are headache inducing. I'm tired of this band calling themselves \\"blues rock\\", they quite clearly are not. Listen to John Mayer, Bonnie Raitt or the Dave Matthews Band for a true taste of the genre. By the way, the guitar/drum duo was lifted from the great classic rock band The White Stripes. No originality whatsoever.
B004WMMFBY|5.0|This episode was great. It kept my attention all the way thru.  It takes you to a point where you feel as though you are through with it and brings you right back to loving it. Can't wait to see the next episode.    That's VD for ya.
B0011Z10PC|5.0|Weird to think that the dopes who wrote the immature \\"Dookie\\" have managed to achieve such great heights in their music, and create the best album of the 2000s.<br /><br />In short, this album tells the story about a suburban kid's transition into a rebellious punk livin' in the city and his eventual downfall; though it sounds simple, but it's a carefully nuanced, heartfelt tale of wasted youth that triumphs over the likes of \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\", both in it's message and in it's music. American Idiot is Green Day's chef d'oeuvre in which the trio shows off their serious chops in the songwriting and instrumentation categories, and the turning point in musical history: Billie Joe earned himself the \\"Most Important Songwriter of the Decade\\" title, previously held by Michael Bolton & the New Kids on the Block crew.<br /><br />Buy this album now, and ignore their childish 1990s antics. American Idiot is the real deal.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great graphics, and runs silky smooth on original Droid. Got it from Amazon for free, but I'd pay a buck for another one from this developer.
B002ZG99J0|2.0|Everyone in the theater laughed at the most \\"suspenseful\\" parts of this movie. It is overly dramatic, poorly written, and not believable. By the end, I felt more sorry for the stalker than I did for the \\"heroine.\\" The one positive of the movie is that the acting is pretty decent. Billy Zane gives a nice performance as a fashion professor. All in all, if you are going to see a PG-13 thriller (NOT HORROR) starring the chick from Gossip Girl, then you are probably just looking for a fun time. Sadly, this fails even on that level. Instead of this, rent \\"Single White Female\\" for a GOOD stalker mix of thriller/horror movie! C
1400052181|5.0|This book has it all: science (without going over the lay person's head), ethical behavior, ownership rights, family drama, and racial tension. I will never be the same now that I've read this book!
B004FOA84A|3.0|This was a Moderately fun game. It was tough enough that I did need to find some hints online.   When I got to the end I thought there would be more but it just ends. It took me about an hour to play. I wish it had a longer play time. It would have been great if the character found one of Grandpa's time travel devices and we had to travel through time to find and help him.
0743277465|4.0|Using the metaphor of his own exceptional life, Josh Waitzkin opens up the secrets of learning in this book. His stories take you deep into his own experiences as a chess prodigy and where that led him. The kind of learning he describes does not happen in the classroom, but rather is an inner discovery driven by passion and natural abilities. So you won't learn how to learn in this book. Enough has been written about that. Instead you will read a description of natural learning that comes from the heart. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has exceptional abilities, whether those abilities are currently expressed or not.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This movie is amazing for all ages. The muppets and plot can get a little corny, but it's a kid's fantasy movie. I highly suggest enjoying it with family sometime.
B004FOA84A|1.0|they really should have run a compatibility test on the various phones and OS's before offering it to all droids. Sad but it being free, I'm not too upset.

B004HGBUVG|1.0|Upon the advance release of the single \\"Buttercup\\" I was shaking my head in disappointment knowing this was perhaps the best track on this release intending to help \\"sell\\" the total package. What a complete disappointment! And this is the case with the rest of the material on this collection.    Listen closely to Buttercup's verse; it's of the non original, generic, paint by numbers faire. A stock I, IV, V blues chord pattern is what we have here. Songwriting examples like this certainly let you see how untalented the artist is. Can they come up with their own original catchy melodic lines? Are there some interesting backing tracks to propel the melody? Does the tone of the voice make a interesting bridge between the melodic content and the mesh of the backing tracks? In this case, NO, NO and NO!    What makes \\"Buttercup\\" even worse is the tone of her voice. It`s perhaps the worse garbled & slurred it's EVER been. Output like this puts everything into perspective. Lucinda Williams has never had much talent. If an artist did have talent they would be pushing themselves into creating of a higher nature each time a new release came out. This effort is just plain dull, lacklust, & lazy.    The arrangements of each song are very much so thrown together with no attention on flow. \\"Oh, let's just do a standard verse, chorus, verse, chorus, middle 8, verse, chorus. Or perhaps we can just add some extra long sections of someone can kind of pick at some type of solo lines to fill in the dead space.\\" Is is exactly what's going on, arrangements that are thrown together with no attention to detail. Poor, Poor, POOR!    To add insult to injury a great many of the non commercial stations are playing this is high rotation. Why? In this world of constant rotation there are a certain amount of slots to fill in any aspect of life. Lucinda has been around a while and is known so it's easy to pick this release out of familiarity and push it in a heavy rotation slot. Is it worth the attention? Absolutely not! Steer clear of this one and avoid the hype. It's just not worth it especially if you care about the quality of music. This one is quite \\"dumbed\\" down on the quality and content aspect, pass this one over and find someone deserving to give your available cash supply to. File this under extreme nothing special.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I hear it is a fun game, but I wouldn't know because it never loaded. I may give it another change one day, but I can't say when that day will be.
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|This review is based on my 7 year old son's view of the item.  He is a big fan of the t.v. show, and so I ordered this for his 7th birthday.  He just got it today and he has listened to it at least 5 times through, between the car and at home.  He was even playing it while showering, and singing in the shower.  So I'd say it's a hit...for a 7 year old boy anyway!  The disc arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|With the rising prominence of documentary filmmaking over the past decade, it is great to see a sizable production budget and artistic competence go to into a project as intelligent and relevant as this one. Refreshingly free of Michael Moore style hijinks or maudlin anecdotes of personal suffering, Ferguson is sparing in his use of the more obvious visual signifiers of the wreckage of the global financial meltdown of 2008 in favor of three things that powerfully cohere: textbook-style graphics that quantify the magnitude and outline the basic characteristics of this collapse and its causes, Matt Damon's cerebral voiceover, and beautiful cinematography.    Framed in high definition widescreen by the opulent surroundings of their own offices and dens, and given the imperative to defend the indefensible, Ferguson's interview subjects are repeatedly reduced to evasions, stutters, grimaces, and lip smacks as they are forced to acknowledge their participation in a corrupt industry. For very good reasons, many of the ripest subjects for Ferguson's grilling declined to go camera with him, only to be involuntarily cast in this film through their many media appearances.    The irony of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's patronage of high end Wall Street prostitutes is expertly handled: Spitzer, with known ambition to prosecute financial malfactors, gets disgraced, while his madame's extensive client list, rich with a who's who Wall Street players, gets ignored. In a reserved, factual tone, Matt Damon's voiceover identifies the deliberate failure of prosecutors  to use this list as leverage to investigate financial corruption: \\"In an industry in which drug use, prostitution, and fradulent billing of prostitutes as a business expense occurs on an industrial scale, it wouldn't be hard to get people to talk if you really wanted to.\\"    The restrained delivery only makes this indictment of our current political leadership even more powerful.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Always force closes.  Just downloaded no working. Currently on ginger bread. Stupid 25 word minimum response. Not much else to say other than that. Peace out
B004FOA84A|5.0|I'm very pleased with this game. The graphics are sharp and vibrant. Its one of those mystery/discovery type games. It kind of reminds me of those bathroom escape games but a lot more interesting with way Better graphics. I highly recommend this.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is one of my childhood favorites...and now I have it to pass on to my two year old daughter! Happy with the quality of the DVD! Thank you :)
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Great CD, not a bad song on it. Worthy of CD of the year, can't see anyone else beating it, except maybe once the new Seether comes out. It's gonna be a good year for music.
B00005KARK|2.0|Unfortunately the Dumbo DVD that I ordered for my daughter and I didn't work when we received it. It skipped and froze throughout. However, when I contacted the seller about the problem, he was very prompt in his response and very helpful. I sent the DVD back and I was issued a refund. It was a bummer that we don't have the DUMBO dvd to enjoy, but I was thankful that it wasn't a problematic situation to deal with. Thank you to the seller for helping to make this an easy process!
B004FOA84A|5.0|One reviewer says it worked great on their phone, but if it doesn't work good on your phone, your phone must be a piece of junk.  That's like saying Paris Hilton is a good role model or that the Garth Brooks 90's model block color shirt that you keep insisting on wearing still makes you da man.  Gotta level with ya, that kind of thinking tells me the reviewer is probably not the brightest bulb in the pack and looks like they've got some issues with flawed logic.  That being said, I see why they would think that, it WAS force closing my EVO phone too, but still.  A little advice from someone much wiser than I...\\"Tis better to be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.\\"  Not hatin' on ya, just throwing out how it looks from where I'm sittin'.    My review:  Cool app and pretty fun.      Now, if you want it to work, make sure all your crap is up to date, apps, firmware, PRL, software, etc.  Also make sure you're not maxin' out your internal memory with too many apps.  Move 'em on over to your SD card.  Make sure your RAM is not maxed out also.  Finally, try a reboot after doing all of the above.  If none of that makes any sense or if you've had your phone a while and your fav app remains the one that makes it sound like you fart every time you move, Android phones may not be yo' thang.  Give some serious consideration to filing for a divorce with your phone because your relationship with her is probably not going to get much better no matter how much you put into it.  Trust me, it's you, not her.    Might I recommend joining all of the beautiful people and marrying into the iPhone family where you will probably find the most iPeace, iJoy, and iHappiness.  Oh, and iWomen.  Us Android people are almost all men (94% by last count), most of which aren't great marriage material, who love digging into these little jewels of technology to figure out how to improve our marriage with 'em while causing as little damage as possible with as little communication as possible.  Plus, most of us are ugly.  If that still sounds appealling, welcome to our dysfunctional family.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game but much too short. Still, I had fun and it is worth a download. Runs fine on my Droid X, no problems. Amazon apps are always so poorly reviewed, makes you wonder who's on here.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Crashes before it even opens on the Motorola Xoom. I wish I knew how the other Xoom owner got his to work. I'll wait for an update.

1604680547|5.0|From the editors of Quiltmaking Magazine comes a book that is truly inspirational.  It is a must-have for any quiltmaker.  It contains designs for hand and machine quilting and has many, many motifs and designs.  Some of them include children/teens, feathers, flowers, geometric shapes, hearts, seasonal/holiday, and vines and leaves.  There is a section on circle and angle patterns, a size index and a section on how to choose motifs.<br /><br />The motifs are wonderful and there is something for everyone and every quilt.  Whether you quilt by hand or by machine, this is a must-have book.
B0047IIYQI|5.0|I have been listening to Mumford & Sons nonstop for about a year, and I cannot get enough of their music. This deluxe edition includes the original Sigh No More album, plus the bonus track \\"Hold on to what you believe\\", which is brilliant (and it's not available on iTunes). The edition also includes a live album, which I can't say enough about. \\"Feel the tide\\" is the live bonus track, and like \\"Hold on to what you believe\\", it's a beautiful song and not available elsewhere. Buy this edition-you won't be sorry!
B004FOA84A|5.0|It is nice to play a game that is not like most out there. I have always been into these kinds of games. It's really just a click (or touch) and go kind of game. Fun puzzles in it. I really do hope that more of these kinds of games come out with this great of detail in graphics. I have seen some other games that are like this but this one has the best rendered scenes and sounds. I say that if you are into puzzle games then this is a must get.<br /><br />Other notes: Yes the game is short but it's what I expect. I don't understand giving it low rating just because it's short. Also the game does have some bugs when starting up. It does force close a few times randomly but it's nothing to yell about. That again will not make me give it low rating. I rate it high because it's a very well made game with great graphics and fun puzzles. I am sure the maker will update it with patches.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I've made sure all the pistons, calipers and valves are properly calibrated. The compressors, chamber and shaft are also working correctly. Yet when I try to run this game, it just shuts down and this thing is a pain to restart. Developer needs to add support for legacy devices.
B004FOA84A|1.0|For this today and keep getting message how program has stopped unexpectedly. You would think the featured game of the day would be a working one. Droid 2.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Loved the game. Fun and just challenging enough to keep you entertained. I do wish it was longer but that won't stop me from searching for more like it. Runs great on my HTC Thunderbolt.
B004GHNHVW|1.0|I usually don't bother to write a review of an album unless I love it, but in this case, I'm making an exception.  Before I start, I want to say that I really spent some time listening and re-listening to \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" thinking that perhaps this will be one of those albums that require repeated listenings before the listener  \\"get's it.\\"  This was not the case.  Repeated listenings only confirmed what I thought:  Rhythm without melody doesn't work.  Pops and grunts and utterances and very few chord changes without resolution just becomes noise and unpleasant.  I was so disappointed as I was very much looking forward to this new release.  I can't imagine this album will be able to find an appreciative audience no matter how devoted a fan of Paul Simon you are.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I can't wait to have this DVD in my collection.  It is a family friendly feature that I can watch over and over again with my grandchildren, nieces and nephews, (and the adults won't be bored by it either).  It is about family and faith and overcoming adversity and giving back.  Every actor was perfect for their role.  The scenery is beautiful as is the message.  I am also looking for a soundtrack for the movie.  If I could give this movie 10 stars I would!  Bethany Hamilton is a true American Hero, for all the right reasons!
B004FOA84A|2.0|Sadly, I couldn't run the app on my LG Optimus S even after clearing the cache and ending unused apps with ATK. Repeatedly force closed. Too bad.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|This is a journey in to man's mind and his perseverance to escape from the clutches of sure death. Aron Ralston sets out to explore Utah's Canyonland without telling anyone. While exploring here he is trapped by a boulder, without a way to freedom. Clearly everyone knows the outcome of the movie but the movie's strength is in the journey of taking you there to that end. Danny Boyle and the camera team have done some amazing camera work because most of the work takes place in the confines of a narrow space. The camera is very intimate and only one actor.  The one thing that I thought worked in making this movie a worth watch was the reality of this harrowing experience that the real Aron faced. James Franco acts superbly and looks the part of the mountaineer Aron Ralston. During the 127 hour ordeal, he reflects on his life and we get a few glimpses of his family and lost love, all packing an emotional punch. The final few minutes have many people grimacing in their seats especially because they knew all this happened. I was too, but amazed at the hikers will to survive. Beautiful locations and music complement this amazing human drama. 4 stars. 4/19/2011
1416550550|3.0|(CONTAINS SPOILERS)  The Forgotten Garden was a bit lengthy and all-over-the-place, but overall I did enjoy it. It was a fun escape, but not exactly great literature. I find it extremely hard to believe that (according to the interview with the author on this book's Amazon page) Kate Morton did not realize or intend to draw parallels with The Secret Garden. Are you kidding me? ...Not only the obvious garden itself, but the sickly child who is \\"brought back to life\\" by the fresh air and \\"magic\\" of the garden ... with the garden serving as a metaphor for the child's life. That's the exact plotline for The Secret Garden!  Also, I thought the story wrapped up a bit too neatly (the storyline with Cass and Christian was worthy of much eye-rolling), with all of the coincidences a bit hard to swallow.  The fairy tales within the novel were a nice addition, but I wish they would've been included in an appendix, rather than right in the middle of the story. I thought they were really distracting and disrupted the rhythm of the narrative.  There were some positive notes to the story, as well. I really enjoyed Eliza's character, especially the background story and details about her life growing up as an orphan with Sammy. Also thought Adeline was a great villain! Didn't you love to hate her? I loved the setting and descriptions of Cornwall, as well.  I'd recommend this book to someone looking for a fun diversion.

B004FOA84A|5.0|this game works great on my Evo Andy wifes Evo Shift, I see the negative reviews are coming from those with lower end devices like the Optimus V etc... The big problem with some of the apps on the Amazon app store is the inability for it to  distinguish properly if it will run properly on each device...
B004FOA84A|5.0|very cool game with awesome graphics.  would love to see an update to make the game longer.  really like this kind of game.<br /><br />five stars especially for free.
0307279189|5.0|Let me first say that I hate running and this book may have changed that for me. It's not only a story about amazing physical abilities but the emotional connection that comes with them. The runners in this book find meaning and inspiration in places I never thought possible. Their ability to transform running into a state of nirvana is truly awesome. Now if you will excuse me, I am going to go outside and look for my inspiration.

B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed this game, but I played through the entire thing in about 30 minutes. I was hoping there would be another story or level after that, but it was the end. I'm glad it was free, or I would be disappointed that I wasted my money on something that was only half an hour of fun. No loading or force close issues on my Droid X.

I'd love to see more of this type of game with the same high quality.  no disappointments here.  just lots of fun!
B004FOA84A|2.0|Graphics and sound are great, game looks like it is well designed and fun. The bad news is that it is over 16m and can't be moved to the SD card. Since my phone does have other things to do, I had to uninstall it.
B003N7GATM|5.0|This album is a great surprise. You will definately think NIN when you hear this album because of Trent. I don't care about all the speculation and gossip talk about how or why Mariqueen Maandig is in this. I think she sounds fine and her voice compliments the production well. Can't wait for more.
B004G600A4|5.0|I loved this movie! So cute! My mom got it for me off my wishlist and it was uber cute. I loved it.  It arrived in a timely fashion and in great condition. Definitely a keeper for your collection. My favorite characters were the horse Maximus and the little lizard Pascal.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I am rating this higher because I am pretty sure it is better than  the rating it currently has.  It runs fine on Vibrant.  It seems like a decent game that is worth a buck.
B00008OWZC|5.0|My boyfriend heard this cd playing at a friends BBQ and liked it so I bought it for him.  He loves it!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I first seen \\"Band of Brothers\\", (B.O.B. from hereon in) on \\"The History Channel. Yes, it took forever because of commercials. However, I couldnt quite afford it since my husband and I are both 100%.  One day I was at a store and B.O.B. DVD Set was there with a $15.00 price tag. I couldn't pass it up.  I thought it was mis-priced but the checkout assured me that was the price. So, my husbands birthday was days away and now we watch it without the commercials!  It has been watch over 50 times and I never tire of it and I always catch something I missed during previous viewings.  I lent it to my dad and made him promise to have it back it a week. I went and picked it back up after that. This is one movie we will enjoy for years to come.
B003MC5N28|1.0|i didnt like it at all. the story is strange and the ending was weak. i would not reccomend it!!!!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|After falling in love with \\"Band of Brothers\\", I had to purchase \\"The Pacific\\" to go with it.  I was disappointed in the movie.  Perhaps if I had watched it before \\"B.O.B.\\" it would have been better.  There was so much hype that my expectations were high.  Unfortunately, it's only been viewed twice, yet we still watch Band Of Brothers.  : (

B004FOA84A|5.0|Good game, good graphics. A lot like the PC game Myst from the 90s.  Puzzles were a bit too easy and game play was short (about an hour).  Ending leaves room for sequel.  Overall fun game.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Reminds me of the older games from the 80s that Sierra use to make. Bit on the short side but what do you expect from low cost phone games?
B004FOA84A|4.0|I loved this game. Had a few more FC than I'd like to see. Needs to have move to SD option, game very big in size.  Can't wait for part 2 or another one

B004S5OEK0|5.0|The English Riviera is the newest album from British eclectic electronic music group, Metronomy. I am a recent fan of their stuff, having followed youtube 'related' videos around one day until happening upon their video for 'A Thing for Me'. The release of this addition to my Metronomy collection was highly anticipated and rather than being disappointed, as I half expected from the hype I had assigned it in my head, I was completely blown away.     Taken together, Mount takes the listener on a journey through more than an album. Each song is another step down a path: a solid mix of sentimentality, rhythm, and fun. This album has it all. It stretches the bounds of normal just enough to still be mostly mainstream and appealing to the ears of the masses, but also push those ears just a bit more to enjoy some notes, rhythms, and melodies that they wouldn't normally accept so readily. It's ear-expanding music (this is a terrible phrase and I'm ashamed that I've said it).     At any rate, I could not be more into Metronomy and I look forward to seeing how they evolve. For now I'll be listening to The English Riviera on repeat and thanking god I'm an ocean away from Mr. Mount or I'd be up one restraining order.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Despicable Me is a very entertaining animated feature film that captures your attention even if you're an adult and pretty much know where the plot is going. Young children will clamor to see this film over and over again; one of its strengths is that the humor can be appreciated by both children and adults. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the quality of the animation is outstanding. The voice-overs impressed me; the casting for the character voices is just perfect and that's grand. In addition, the musical score enhances the film.<br /><br />When the action starts (and there's plenty of action at that), we quickly meet evil Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) whose mother (voiced by the great Julie Andrews) wasn't exactly nurturing when he was growing up. Gru delights in stealing things to maintain his reputation as the world's most evil villain; but Gru is upstaged when another, younger villain named Vector (voiced by Jason Segel) has a shrink ray machine--something Gru needs badly for his master plan to steal the moon from the sky and make the world pay for it. However, there's quite a bit of competition between Gru and Vector for the shrink ray machine--and that's where three young adorable, innocent girls come in. Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier) and Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove) are all living in a run-down orphanage for girls run by the malevolent Miss Hattie (voiced by Kristen Wiig); they are ordered by Miss Hattie to sell cookies by the dozens to avoid being stuck in a public \\"box of shame\\" and the girls desperately want to be adopted by a great mom and dad.<br /><br />The plot really heats up when Gru has an \\"aha\\" moment (he says \\"light bulb\\"). Gru and his tiny little helped called the \\"minions\\" make up a false background for him so that he can adopt the three girls from the orphanage. Gru tells Miss Hattie he wants the girls to add light to his life as a highly respected and award winning dentist; but in actuality Gru wants the girls merely to sell \\"robot cookies\\" to Vector--robot cookies that will steal the shrink ray machine and get Gru the ability to steal the moon and realize his evil dream that he and his sidekick/mentor Dr Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have yearned to do for years.<br />The rest of the plot may be obvious to some readers, but of course I'm stopping here to avoid any spoilers--and there will be some at that! I haven't mentioned everything up to this point and I'm not about to tell you more, either.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some nice bonus features including a featurette about the film itself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in animated feature films and high quality control family entertainment.s merely to sell \\"robot cookies\\" to Vector--robot cookies that will steal the shrink ray machine and get Gru the ability to steal the moon and realize his evil dream that he and his sidekick/mentor Dr Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have yearned to do for years.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I have never heard \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" in such vivid detail. I remember hearing it in Quadrophonic vinyl in the 70's, but the 5.1 mix is much better. It was like hearing the album as I imangine it sounded when Alan Parsons was mixing it in the studio. A very pleasant listening experience.

B004KA9MQO|5.0|I don't even know where to begin in stating how much I love the power house singing sensation that is Jennifer Hudson. I loved her on American Idol... I loved her in Dreamgirls... [[ASIN:B000O174CM Dreamgirls (Two-Disc Showstopper Edition)]] I loved her in Sex and the City... [[ASIN:B001DDBCUU Sex and the City: The Movie (Special Edition)]] I loved her first album... [[ASIN:B0019T9FL6 Jennifer Hudson]] I loved her when she was heavier... (And thought she looked AMAZING then too!) And I love her new svelte DIVA look and the sparkling attitude (Two snaps!) that goes with it...<br />  And so I've been waiting for this album for a long damn time...<br />  Let's start with the cover art... If Wonder Woman were black (And I've always thought there should be one!), and if she wore purple, then THIS is what she'd look like. Check out that dress! And those bracers! UMMM!<br />  So let's get down to the songs...<br /><br />1). No One Gonna Love You: A- rating. A good mid tempo jam.<br />2). I Got This: A solid A rating. A REALLY good slow jam that just overflows with self reliance.<br />3). Where You At: A+ WOW! A hell of lead single, and it's obvious why it was chosen. This will become one of the songs best known in the aftermath of a breakup or a betrayal.<br />4). Angel: Another solid A. A really nice upbeat take on that special someone being an angel.<br />5). I Remember Me: Also an A. An unbelievable song about trying to find your way back to yourself. In fact, I think it would make an AMAZING single. Guess we'll see.<br />6). Gone: A+ This song is stellar. A fresh and modern take about wanting to be with someone so much that you can't imagine your life without them.<br />7). Everybody Needs Love: A- A solid effort on a song with a great retro sound and vibe. You can almost hear Jennifer Hudson as one of the Disco Queen of days gone by.<br />8). Why Is It So Hard: A- Another powerful song with a great retro vibe, and amazing soulful vocals.<br />9). Don't Look Down: A- A great uptempo song that matches the tune and tone of it's positive message.<br />10). Still Here: A++ THIS is the reason this album was born. If you buy the album for this song alone, you'll have gotten your money's worth. You can HEAR, no, FEEL, Jennifer Hudson's pain over the loss of her mom, brother, and nephew. That event gave birth to the power house ballad that is this song. I cannot listen to it without crying... For her loss, and for the loss I've experienced in my life, which this song evokes. And that's what any great song is supposed to do. And this one delivers!<br />11). Feeling Good: A grade. Jennifer Hudson's unbelievable spin on an old classic. And more than that, this is the theme song to some of her Weight Watcher's commercials. Oh that's right. Jenny lost some weight, and looks DAMN good, and she's telling the world she's 'Feeling Good!'<br />12). Believe: A+ This is one of the best gospel flavored songs I've ever heard. Such a powerful message about being a Christian, and believing in something more, something unseen, but certainly felt.<br /><br />  So okay folks, that's my 2 cents on the matter. As I said, if you buy this album for Still Here (and Where You At, Gone, and Believe) alone, you'll have gotten your money's worth. VERY few albums can get A's of some sort on EVERY song. But this one does so, and easily. A solid A+, and destined to be a classic for all time. If you're even remotely a fan of Jennifer Hudson, grab this album, because you'll love it.

B004OKFIYU|4.0|When I saw this album being released on sacd I had high hopes (like the stranger sacd 5.  1). this transfer is the best of piano man by far but why isn't there a 5.1 version?? The stranger sounded so great in 5.1 and I wanted so much the same for piano man. In any event the 2ch sacd version does sound the best that you will get, as of this date, for this album.

B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is well put together, but feels short if you are good at these types of games and figure it out too easily. the only way I could suggest making it better is simply making it longer with more involved puzzles and a higher difficulty.

B002ZG99N6|3.0|I tried watching this movie a month or so ago with my teenage boys but my 17 year old wanted to switch because of the constant swearing. Yesterday, I watched the whole thing, but this time alone. This heist story is fast-paced and entertaining, the acting is quite good, and the dialogue is great. Good mix of drama, action, tension, suspense and even some humor.<br /><br />The film is about a group of robbers, led by Doug McRay, brilliantly played by Ben Affleck, who grew up together on the wrong side of the tracks in Charlestown. Doug falls in love with their hostage, Clair, played by Rebecca Hall, from a heist. The robbers let her go but after discovering that she lives in their neighborhood, Doug tracks her down to make sure she won't talk. That part was somewhat unbelievable because first of all, she didn't see their faces since they were wearing masks, and second of all, since Doug's best friend Jem or James, superbly played by Jeremy Renner, does not hesitate to kill at any other point in the movie, it is somewhat far-fetched that he would just let a hostage go if he had any doubts as to whether she could identify them.<br /><br />Nethertheless, in the process of following Clair, the somewhat vulnerable and sensitive Doug develops a relationship with her which causes him to question his life of crime. The FBI, already suspicious of her since she is the assistant bank manager and the one who opened the vault for the gang, discovers that she is in contact with Doug which causes them to suspect her even more.<br /><br />At first, she doesn't know that Doug was involved in the robbery but later finds out through the FBI. The edgy and vicious Jem is not happy to learn that Doug is becoming involved with Clair, and even more unhappy when Doug tells him that he wants to leave his life of crime. But the crime bosses won't let him and threaten him that he has to do another job and of course, this time, it all goes bad. Chris Cooper briefly plays McRay's father who has been sentenced to many life sentences and Jon Hamm the FBI agent who is after the group.<br /><br />What works well in this movie is that even though MacRay is the bad guy, you end up rooting for him all the way.tences and Jon Hamm the FBI agent who is after the group.

B004PGO25O|5.0|Any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower will elicit Resistance, according to Steven Pressfield in this book. Resistance includes fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing and perfectionism, and it is the worst enemy of the artist or entrepreneur; the second worst is rational thought which wants to control our creativity; and the third worst is family and friends who want us to remain as we are.<br /><br />On the other hand, the allies of the artist and entrepreneur are stupidity, stubbornness, blind faith, passion, assistance and friends and family. The book goes on to describe how resistance might be encountered and countered  at the beginning, middle and end of any project. You can defeat resistance in the beginning of a project by starting before you are ready, and at the end of the project by having the courage to ship your finished work.<br /><br />The themes in the book are very similar to those in the author's previous book The War of Art and to those in Seth Godin's book Poke the Box. That does not make them any less relevant. Nearly everyone struggles with one or more of the negative influences which constitute the Resistance, and as a consequence every family, school, workplace and country suffers an enormous loss of productivity. The writing style might be a bit too confrontational for some readers, but the underlying message is an important one.
B000006OHL|5.0|Amazed when this arrived and I read the liner notes describing how composer Bernard Herman died in his sleep on the night he wrapped this recording. As my composition teacher told me, \\"at least he died happy!\\" Great music, thought-provoking and of the times.
B000C20VRS|5.0|I guess the reason I like this movie is that it is really a spoof.  No one comes from Cuba and within 2 years becomes drug King pin of South Florida, but forget the plot, it is the characters that make this movie work.  Trying to recreate that late 1970s feel is done quite well.  Al Pacino's Latino accent is a bit off at times and on more than one occasion I heard a little NYC in some of his words, but easily forgiven.<br /><br />I watched the DVD with Spanish dubs AND Spanish sub-titles and I even noticed that there were several mistranslations there, too.  The Spanish voices are pretty poor.  You would think the post production people could have come up with nastier sounding dudes.<br /><br />All in all, I still give it an A+
B004FOA84A|5.0|fun game, but i finished it in 20 minutes? glad it was free today cause i dont think 20 minutes is worth a dollar. fun though
0307454541|3.0|Mikael Blomkvist is really the protagonist in this novel. The Girl... is really more of a supporting actress. Larsson draws the reader in with mundane detail that makes a fiction story seem like reality. The book comes to life with enough plot line to have an engaged reader remember every turn towards the finish. The parts when Salander makes an appearance are the most exciting. I Plan to read the rest of the series to continue the adventure.<br /><br />As fiction goes, this is pretty standard. The story has a way of working itself out that is masterful in the way it is crafted (with each character fulfilling his/her role) but also too perfect to be believable. Larsson's attention to detail earn high marks as well as the interwoven complex story with many identifiable personalities, however the sentimental lack of conflict is hard to grasp in a supposedly suspenseful mystery novel. In fact, I think the suspense is too far drawn out in between climaxes, that it doesn't allow the reader to continue interest through some of the dull parts. There seems to be an endless supply of money, resources and energy in this book that allow an impossible mystery to be solved by the most tedious scrutiny of a single detail.
B000SQJ2JG|3.0|When Tommy Bolin enterned the frame of replacing Ritchie Blackmore in one of the most popular hard rock bands of its time, it certainly seemed an interesting coupling to see how an American guitar virtuoso could fit into an otherwise, British band. Bolin's pedigree had ranged from early bands such as Zephyr and Energy to being a session musician on jazz records like Billy Cobham's Spectrum to replacing Joe Walsh in the James Gang. Blackmore left after the lacklustre Stormbringer album, which began to incorporate an R&B flavor into its sounds. From the opening salvo of Comin' Home, its obvious that Bolin slipped easily into Deep Purple's musical palette with absolute ease. And Bolin contributed heavily to this album on the songwriting aspect co-writing all but 3 numbers. Come Taste is actually a breath of fresh air compared to the previous Stormbringer, even though the direction the band was in may not have been the most popular with Purple's older fans, let alone Blackmore aficionados. Tommy's style stands on its own merits however and he possessed a very creative, malleable style that suited this record very well. Dealer, Lady Luck, Drifter, Love Child and I Need Love all have a purposeful focus and a great blend of Purple's newfound groove rock intact. Bolin and Hughes co-wrote Gettin' Tighter which would provide the two to really stretch out together in the live shows supporting this release. It's a funky number but it rocks and rolls too. The only tracks I find a bit hum-drum are Hughes' This Time Around and the closing You Keep On Moving; the quality is strong on these tracks, I just don't care for what they are. As much as I love the Mach2 lineup with Gillan and Glover the best, its hard not to like this album even if it was a one shot deal. Bolin more than proved himself worthy on this record, its only when they began to tour that things went south, unfortunately. Give this disc a chance if you haven't heard it. You might be pleasantly suprised at what comesout of the speakers. I give this album 3 and a half stars....
B003UESJHY|5.0|This is a great film. From the opening sequence played out to the song \\"How you like me now?\\" this never lets up. The characters are all really well rounded. Bale is well deserving of his oscar for playing a part that could have ended up looking daft, but somehow he pulls it off without ever overacting. The mother is also brilliant and provides some very funny moments. Mark Wahlberg does a great job in the lead role of just allowing the others around him to hog the limelight. This film is well worthy of its award nominations and victories.

6302510341|5.0|Saturday afternoons were made for great adventure yarns, and serials dating all the way back to the silent era played upon our love of a rousing good jungle story, filled with danger and the thrill of discovery, with just enough romance thrown in to suggest love sprung from such exciting endeavors. RKO would make the most supreme adventure of all time and in 1933 change the expectations of moviegoers forevermore once the lights dimmed and their logo adorned screens across America. A new bar for adventure was set, and the film which raised it was King Kong. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Shoedsack helmed this fabulous RKO film from an idea by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.<br /><br />King Kong was much more than a girl screaming as a huge ape held her in his palm, just as Fay Wray was much more than a \\"B\\" icon with one great sound film to her credit. She had graced many silent productions, including Coast Patrol, Street of Sin, The Wedding March, and Paramount's last silent, The Four Feathers, where she worked with Merian C. Cooper. She made an easy transition to sound, her lovely presence and vulnerability boosting many early talkies from average to worth watching. Her importance to the success of King Kong is often not given its full due due to the staggering technical achievements behind the camera, often overshadowing everything else. Wray is simply wonderful at the beginning of King Kong, making viewers fall in love with her Ann Darrow long before Kong appears. If this was only an extraordinarily polished jungle adventure, it would be a film classic simply on the basis of Wray's performance and a timeless 1930's sense of style and adventure. With the added element of King Kong, a fearsome beast protective of something too beautiful to allow harm to come to it, it became one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong is Carl Denham, a filmmaker known for his exciting tales of adventure. A ship bound for a mysterious location only known to Denham to make a film needs only a bit of romance to satisfy the studio. Finding the lovely Ann Darrow about to pass out from hunger during the depression is a stroke of luck for the brash director. Ann is suspicious of Denham's proposal at first, but hunger and his enthusiasm, and his assurance that there are no strings attached, give Ann hope that her luck has changed. Fay Wray is wonderful in these early moments, which often get forgotten amidst the thrilling adventure encountered in the later half of the story. She endears herself to the audience early on and cements our affection for Ann once onboard. Bruce Cabot is excellent as John Driscoll, weary of having a woman onboard but soon falling in love with Anne just as viewers have. Their romance is sweet, filled with the innocent love of the era that has a timeless appeal.<br /><br />It has been breezy fun for the viewer until the ship is west of Sumatra. Denham reveals a map he has obtained in Singapore pinpointing an uncharted island where legends of a high wall and a beast called Kong are said to exist. As they approach Skull Island adventurous fun gives way to fog shrouded waters and jungle drums. The high wall does indeed exist, and after a scrape with natives enamored of Ann they find themselves confronted by a world untouched by time. Great beasts from prehistoric times roam the jungles of the island, Kong the most fearsome of all, ruling his kingdom from a high cliff where he will take Ann. Harrowing action and thrills ensue as Jack tracks his love after Kong disposes of everyone else but Carl to protect his lovely prize. The special effects still offer excitement but it is the story which makes this film such a classic. We are rooting for Jack to rescue Ann just as in the best serials, only this is no serial, but rather a topflight production creating an astounding adventure heretofore unseen in theatres.<br /><br />A gripping escape over a cliff edge will lead to Kong's demise when he follows Ann and is capturedby Carl. Billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history. High above the New York skyline, atop the Empire State Building, Ann will find herself in the arms of the man who loves her when Kong faces down dangers he never had in the jungle. It is both romantic and bittersweet. Max Steiner's score, a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose which perfectly balances romance and adventure, and sterling photography from Eddie Linden, Veronica Walker, and J.C. Taylor make this a memorable experience.<br /><br />Though Fay Wray is terrific in this film, it is a shame that many viewers only know her from King Kong. Born in Canada but raised in the United States, she was a big supporter of events held at the Empire State Building over her lifetime, and after her passing, the lights of that landmark were dimmed for fifteen minutes in her memory. King Kong is perfect viewing for a lazy Saturday and if you haven't seen it in some time, or perhaps never seen it, it is much more than you might have imagined. A lovely way to remember Fay Wray.h Wonder of the World, the flash of cameras perceived by Kong as an attack on his Ann creates chaos in the streets when he breaks free, leading to perhaps the most famous ending in film history.

B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I loved this book...I must admit I have seen this book on bookshelves for a long time. The only reason I \\"listened\\" to it was because it was free..However I fell in love with the characters and story line...I would recomend this book!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|fun times. great little puzzle game. you should definitely give it a try. i hope they make another one! but longer next time please! Thanks.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I never got a chance to even try it. Would never open. Force closes on every attempt to use. It's a shame because the game looked interesting.
B004G8QHKO|4.0|Nothing earth-shatteringly new here. But if you like Arcade Fire, Passion Pit, School of Seven Bells and MGMT's first album...this will be right up your alley. Good stuff. I dig it a lot.
B003Y74KC0|3.0|This is a basic silicone case that's good for protecting against nicks and scratches on the iPhone's body. The screen is still unprotected, so if that's a concern you should pick up a screen protector too. Remember, this isn't a heavy duty case like an Otterbox -- dropping your phone on concrete will likely result in a crack even with this case on.    As a bonus, this case (like any other case) helps with the iPhone's attenuations problems (i.e. the grip of death). While the antenna problems aren't as pronounced due to Verizon's stronger network, they still happen. This case prevents that issue.    On the downside, the material picks up dust and pocket lint easily. It can be rinsed off with water easily, but you'll have to do that more often than you like.    For the price, this case offers very basic protection. Personally, I suggest either going \\"naked\\" with the phone or getting something heavy duty like an Otterbox.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Game premise is simply, you launch different types of brids from a slingshot at pigs hiding inside structures made of wood, glass, and concrete. Each bird type has its own \\"powers\\" and each works a bit differently against the different materials. The goal of the game is to destroy all of the pigs of which there are usually between 3-8 per board. Concept is very simply, but the various combinations of buildings, placements, bird types, etc...... lead to a great variety of levels and challenges.    I started with the freebie \\"Angry Birds Rio\\" when amazon launched their app store. Really liked it and also picked up the buck version of the regular game afterwards. Very happy. Have been playing for a few weeks and still not through all the levels yet. What I like most is that I can play this for 30 minutes or just do a quick board for 5 minutes. I have the droid x, and it is running fine on that device. I think the bigger screen does help with the game play. I would be interested to see how this runs on a tablet with an even bigger screen though as you can often not see both the bird launcher and the target at the same time, which makes the game a bit harder. Also some minor gripes on actually launcing the birds from time to time, but really for the price of this app and the time I have gotten out of it, I would give it 6 stars if I could.    Like the popcap games, this is one that appeals to all ages and demographics. You can pick up the game play very quickly and the combination of godd graphics, physics, and destruction is addictive. If you are on the fence on this one, risk the dollar it is well worth it.
0345522478|5.0|Anyone wandering into Atticus O'Sullivan's shop 'Third Eye Books and Herbs' in Tempe, Arizona would assume that the tatted up young man working there was just another student, or more likely dropout from the nearby university.  They would be surprised to learn that he was the store's owner, and even more surprised to discover that Atticus was actually a Druid and thousands of years old.  So how and why did a Druid who had known Shakespeare personally end up in Tempe, Arizona?  Atticus is a bit vague on the details but it seems as though the fae find the area a bit difficult to travel to and through, which is a good thing if the little people are intent on doing a person harm, as they seem to be to Atticus.  Despite the scarcity of portals problems from the other realm do manage to catch up with Atticus leading to many complications for both him and his Irish wolfhound.    This is the first in a new series of urban fantasy novels featuring Atticus.  In many ways it is similar to Butcher's DRESDEN FILES novels, and would probably appeal to fans of that series.  HOUNDED comes complete with a wise cracking hero who has some supernatural powers attempting to live unnoticed in the mundane world.  Like the DRESDEN FILES Atticus' world is large and richly populated with both supernatural beings and ordinary humans who are largely unaware to the extraordinary events taking place around them.  The pace of this novel was a bit slow but this was primarily due to the large amount of 'world building' that has to take place in the introductory volume of this sort of series.  The author has thoughtfully included a pronunciation guide for the numerous celtic names and terms that figure in this story.    HOUNDED gets this new series off to a great start and has this reader looking forward to the release of HEXED, the second book in the series.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Love this cd.  What a great voice this artist has.  This cd is such a breath of fresh air.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Really fun game. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it's so short :( I'd really like to see a longer version. What happens with the time travel!!!???
B004FOA84A|2.0|Force closes like a fiend on my froyo 2.2.1 Optimus.  About 99 cents worth of length to the game.  A couple of the puzzles are illogical (close the secret study door after you open the regular door). Ending was meh.  At the beginning I was hopeful because the ambiance was reminiscent of the start of \\"Eternal Darkness; Sanity's Requiem\\".  But, I'm not sure the author knows what the word \\"grisly\\" means.  For a just a buck, it is probably worth an hour's entertainment (3-3.5 stars).  But with the constant force closes it rates around 1.5 stars.
0440246008|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the series overall but there have been one or two \\"less than thrilling\\" thrill rides, including The Hard Way.  The first two hundred pages or so are not at all exciting.....rather, they're nearly DULL.  The story starts to shift a little and pick up right around the middle of the book and then BAM - the action, excitement and story itself all get rolling and do not stop.  You definitely do not want to start with this book if you are new to the Jack Reacher series.  If you're reading them in order, as I am, no need to skip this one.  Just know it might take a little while to get into the story.
0307272702|3.0|I started reading this book with high hopes.  At first, the book started out really good - citing the start of obesity in the United States.  Then the author made a radical claim that exercise and cutting calories (the calories in/calories out approach) won't make you lose weight and that it is what we are eating that is making us fat.  The diet that is recommended is somewhat similar to the Atkins diet - it does not restrict fat intake at all.  Taubes actually points out that a low fat diet is not healthy.  I definately agree with some of Taubes' points in the book.  I think a low carb diet is essential for health especially since most of the carbs that we eat today are processed.  I don't agree with eating a diet high in animal fat.  Everything I have read and have come to believe in is that because animals are fed a diet of mostly corn and are no longer grass and grain fed causes them to be high in Omega 6.  When your body has too much Omega 6 and not enough Omega 3, your body becomes inflamed and disease is born.  So, while this book is very interesting, I will not be trying this diet.
0525422943|4.0|I thought the ending was perfect for If I Stay.  I wasn't itching for a sequel, in fact the thought never crossed my mind.  But, I learned that there would be one shortly after finishing it, and told from Adam's point of view no less!<br /><br />I was sucked in to the story right from the start.  I really enjoyed Adam's voice and the style of the story is no different from If I Stay.  I love catching up with characters you've come to really enjoy.  But, its not long before we learn that the 3 years since the events in If I Stay have not been kind to Adam.  He's on edge and having a hard time coping with all the events that have left a superstar.  You can really feel his struggle and I completely understood how he ended up at Mia's concert.  I really loved his internal dialogue the entire evening he spends with Mia.  I felt him come to terms with everything that happened since the accident.<br /><br />I was actually most surprised by Mia herself.  I didn't expect her character to put so much distance between herself and her past.  She hasn't even been back to Oregon once since she left for Julliard.  I was afraid that she had completely cut everyone out of her life, but we learn that's not the case.  It's just Adam that she left.  It turns out that Mia had to come to terms with a lot of things that concerned Adam.<br /><br />The heartbreaking part of the story was watching both of the emotions come to head.  They both feel so much.  While Adam wears it on his sleeve (and the music gives it to everyone), you can tell Mia has been bottling it up for 3 years.  I really loved watching them both hash it all and realize that they still really do love each other.  There was a particularly touching moment involving Adam's guitar!<br /><br />I ended up loving this book way more than I thought possible.  Almost a 5 butterfly, but there were times that Adam's character was a little too whiny for me.  Not being able to let go and move on is a  trait you tend to see in girls after devastating breakups, and it was a bit much at times to have it be the guy instead.it was a bit much at times to have it be the guy instead.
B004FOA84A|5.0|works great on the HTC Evo. Fun adventure/puzzle game, puzzles are interesting without being too hard.  it was kind of short - if you've played these kind of games before, you'll beat it in an hour.
B004FOA84A|1.0|not working on my motor xoom, force closes as soon as I start it, was never able to play it. 25 word min really bites
B004FOA84A|5.0|This worked fine on my droid x.  The game is short but perfect for me - I hate long games.  I'm unsure why there are so many problems with the app for some people.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is an amazing resource. I was extremely happy to see tht it was the free app of the day. I remember whenit was released for the iPhone for$ 49.99 so this is still a steal.<br /><br />This is great for math and I wish I got it earlier in the semester. But this can give you plenty of information on anything from sports to history.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun game that keeps you thinking. Yes, it's fairly short, but enjoyable in a similar vein to Myst, which I loved. The graphics and puzzles are well-done. It's clear that a lot of thought and work went into it!
1936594390|5.0|The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.<br />I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.<br />Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.<br /><br />The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.<br />Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours.
B0033Q5AUI|3.0|I don't think I'm alone in saying that the Twilight books aren't especially well-written.  Nor do the characters travel down any path others haven't traversed a thousand times.  If over-analyzed, yes, Jacob and Edward can easily be seen as abusive and the books themselves obviously un-feminist and pro-abstinence.  But I think by and large, the audience isn't thinking too hard about the undertones--it's simply a love story, one that's quick to read and immerse yourself in.  It's not fine literature and doesn't try to be.  The series is romantic and just plain fun for those of us who don't try to take it all too seriously.<br />This final book was um a departure from the tone and stories of the other three.  Bella and Edward do finally have sex and pretty much the very next scene spells the inevitable trouble from that act--in keeping with the horror (and \\"abstinence only\\" programs) mantra of sex=death.  For the next 1/3 or so of the book things just get *weird*.  It was like a mix of the classic \\"V\\" series and Rosemary's baby with the Z-grade level of horror movie blood geysers thrown in for effort.  It begins to feel very much not like a Twilight book.  Added to that feeling is the sudden perspective shift for a large chunk of the book from Bella to Jacob--for the only reason I can tell that the author wrote herself into a corner with Bella's confinement and needed to move the story \\"outside\\".<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br />The entire book (and actually ever since New Moon) builds to a massive end-all fight between the Volturi and any clans who stand with the Cullens.  It's been promising to be a knock down, drag out, bloody, deadly, bodies-will-roll type of fight.  But it ends up being...nothing.  The characters more or less talk it out and everyone calls it a day.  WHAT!?  No, seriously, WHAT!?  Even Harry Potter finally had his epic fight...<br /><br />Very disappointing way to leave the series and the (inactive) characters.
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|La Boheme is a classic introductory opera and this film conveys it beautifully. Young artists starving in a garret has a romantic appeal but reality invades when the poet Rodolfo realizes that living in poverty is hastening the death of Mimi, the young seamstress; the woman he loves. Even in today's world poverty still takes a murderous toll. Love is a balm to soothe it's sting but not a cure all.    Though Rolando Villazon is in good voice, his scruffy visual image and anxiety portrayal mars the spirit of Rodolfo, the poet who declares in song that he's a millionaire in spirit. This performance is not on par with Villazon's dynamic Alfredo of the 2005 Salzburg Festival La Traviata.    My ideal Rodolfo remains the world famous tenor, Neil Shicoff. His 1982 Royal Opera Boheme filmed at Covent Garden is a cut above and now is available on DVD. I first saw Neil Shicoff in the 1980'S in this role at the Metropolitan Opera. My first thought was that he was my ideal Rodolfo and I've been duly mesmerized since then. A 2003 La Scala Boheme on DVD with Marcello Alvarez portrays a softer yet convincing Rodolfo. Both tenors are far more appealing as Rodolfo than Villazon.    Anna Netrebko as a saucy Mimi has great chemistry with Rolando Villazon. She's a genteel, dreamy Mimi with just a touch of the accustomed defiance with which she endows her heroines. This film is considerably enriched by her vocal elegance. She's a jewel of a Mimi languishing through a cruel fate in bleak surroundings.    Netrebko's interpretation of Mimi differs from that of Mirella Freni, a favorite Mimi, who graciously autographed my musical score of La Boheme backstage at the Met in 1985. Freni's incredible Mimi is truly angelic; a portrait of a tragically ill woman with a noble spirit.    The overall view of life in much of La Boheme is through rose-colored glasses; that is until the calling card of Mimi's impending death trumps it into stark reality. A wise physician once told me that despite the tragic themes in opera, people who listen to opera have a positive outlook on life. Perhaps this is because the music itself lifts everything into a higher realm as we fall under the spell woven by passionate artists doing what they do best.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director.  The stories he tells and performances he extracts from his actors really are nothing short of brilliant.  Whether or not you like Black Swan, it's impossible not to think about and analyze long after the credits roll.<br />The movie is unique in that it's a character study wrapped in a horror/thriller.  This is a character-driven movie.  Do not come in expecting car chases, gun fights, or slasher film blood and gore.  There is blood and gore, but it's all germane to the story being told and the character's descent into madness.  I don't typically care for Natalie Portman, but she does an amazing and thoroughly convincing job as a prima ballerina, a young girl who was never allowed to become a woman, and someone driven to madness in the battle to achieve perfection and essentially \\"adulthood\\".<br />Every frame of this movie, each scene can be analyzed for the subtext, what wasn't being said.  The visual effects are haunting and occasionally blink and you miss it--all of which help the audience to feel as unsettled as Nina.<br />The final act is simply amazing.<br />Know what you're getting into before watching this though.  It's not your typical schlocky broad Hollywood boring crowd pleaser.  It's quiet, understated, and masterful.  This film is all about story and its flawed characters.<br />I think of The Wrestler and Black Swan as companion pieces--brother and sister.  I'd recommend watching them both back to back.
0743289692|5.0|I found this book rivetingly interesting.  I read it almost nonstop for a day.  It is a fascinating story.  It is fairly rare to have such an intellectually curious, formerly devout Muslim person escape Islam's grip, obtain an education and lay Islam's many faults bare for us Kufars. This book is a priceless treasure that should be required reading.  I only have two criticisms of the book. One is that she has turned into an atheist and implicitly presents it as the natural result of enlightened thinking.  I do not agree, but one can hardly blame a person whose early life was made so difficult by such a malevolent religion as Islam to turn away from all religion so adamantly. My second criticism is that she seems to suggests at times that the answer to Islam is for people to begin to interpret it in a more modern light in light of enlightenment values.  I believe that Islam is a revealed religion that must be accepted or rejected for being what it purports to be. If it is a fraud perpetrated upon humanity as I so strongly believe and Ms. Ali would seem to agree, then it must be relegated to the trash heap of history as it is an inherently dangerous ideology that has and will continue to cause untold human suffering.  Despite these flaws, this book is priceless in its dissection of real Islam and its secondary theme that despite the religion's inherent flaws, some people, like her father, rise above those flaws and are nonetheless decent people capable of sincere love.  My heart was warmed by her father's continued love for her despite the incredible strong influence of his religion upon him and its mandate to kill her for her, from an Islamic viewpoint, blasphemy and apostasy.  I was also incredibly impressed with her drive and courage.
B004L49K20|5.0|Well, after 30 years, the pop sensation boys from the UK prove they still have it.  I have picked up every album of Duran Duran's from the first to the current, (some twice after CD's became popular to replace my cassettes) including some import B-sides CD's, deluxe DVD editions, 2 greatest hits albums, 2 live albums, a remix CD, Arcadia's spin off, and more.  I have more MB of their music on my MP3 player than any other artist.  I buy the new albums without question on release date, never waiting for reviews, hoping that I'll have the pleasure of discovering another \\"Rio\\" or \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" before waiting for everyone else to say it's great.  And although I've never been completely disappointed, I've waited a while to give a whole-hearted \\"buy it\\" recommendation to any of my friends or family.  The last few collections have had some really standout songs (\\"Falling Down\\") but they're always accompanied by some pretty annoying (\\"Nite Runner\\") or just bad ones (thankfully not too many).    I can say, without hesitation, if you like good music, especially if you're tired of today's pop scene with all the 13-19 year old artists, you need to get this CD.  This has taken lessons and pieces of all their other albums in some form or other, and it's an impressive collection.  Another reviewer said there weren't any \\"favorites\\" on this album, because they are all good. I mostly agree, but there were a few standout titles for me. Check out \\"Mediterrania\\" for some haunting harmonies that just seem to transport me somewhere else, or \\"Before the Rain\\" for a hint of \\"Sing Blue Silver\\" flair.  I also really loved \\"The man who stole a leopard\\", the title track, \\"Blame the Machines\\", \\"Too bad you're so beautiful\\", and ... well, never mind, they really are all good.  I've listened to the CD through completely four times in my car since I opened it three days ago, and am planning on enjoying it a few more times before picking up all my Duran Duran CD's and putting them inthe car to start a reminiscing trip through their musical history.    Just one additional note, I've now had a chance to watch the DVD that came in the Deluxe edition, and I am thrilled with the content.  The track by track creative process from the band is something I've always wanted from a band, any band!  And to think it comes from my favorite, that's even better!  There is the music video for title track, some smaller things like interviews with the artist that did the cover and inserts, etc., but really, the amount of time the band spent on being heard on the DVD is fantastic!  Thank you Nick, Roger, Andy and Simon!  Let's get another album out soon!
0316056863|3.0|Like most women of my generation, I am a fan of Tina Fey.  She is a weekly beacon of joy in a sea of unlikable, unrelatable portrayals of women in the media.  So it kills me that I didn't like her book!<br /><br />Two things:<br /><br />1.  Her dry, punchy humor is wonderful for writing performances, but I don't think it works well in long format.  She's not so much the best story-teller.  Rarely did I find myself captivated by anything in the book or wanting to read more, which made me feel like....<br /><br />2.  She's a very reluctant memoir-writer.  The tone often made me feel like I was intruding somehow by reading what she wrote.  There are points where she outright says she doesn't want to discuss certain events (*perfectly* understandable.)  But her stories feel glossed-over and the people she discusses feel liks frameworks of characters.<br /><br />(I loved the chapter about her father.  It felt rich and I totally understood who he was and how he shaped her life. If the rest of the book had been like that, it would've been great.)<br /><br />Love Tina Fey and I'll continue to watch 30 Rock like a junkie.  But it kills me that I'm not recommending this to my friends.  (I'm not a total downer: if you want a fun memoir, I'd choose Kathy Griffin's instead... just because I think she's a bit better at crafting a story.)
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I'm surprised this book has as many stars as it does. That's the only reason I decided to give it a go, that and one of my friends swore it was \\"Twilight\\" for adults. \\"Right up my alley\\", I thought. Boy, was I wrong. If writing long passages of your heroine doing yoga and exercising passes for narrative nowadays, I feel we're doomed. There were so much boring descriptions of ancient manuscripts and nut eating (and not in a good way), that I really struggled to finish this book. It doesn't even have any really good romance stuff for me to recommend it as a nice get-you-hot kinda read. Bundling? Really? BUNDLING? I can honestly tell you I could have gone my whole life without finding out what that was, and it would have been just fine. At least that made me laugh. I believe Ms. Harkness chose the wrong two characters to write about. I instantly liked Sophie and Nathaniel a hundred times more than the two main characters, and they were only in the book for like forty pages.<br /><br />The ending suggests there will be more coming in this series, I'm gonna go ahead and skip it.
B000GG4KTU|4.0|Good cd. It just had a scratch on it when I got it so I don't listen to it very often.  Pamela in Arkansas
0312360258|3.0|A couple of my friends (who are admittedly a bit younger than me) have been raving about the House of Night books for MONTHS now so I decided to listen to the audiobook version of Marked.<br /><br />First of all the woman who reads the book is awful. Her voice is squeaky, she over enunciates, and its hard to tell which characters are speaking because her voice always sounds exactly the same. I've heard that she reads the next three books as well so already we're looking at a dealbreaker.<br /><br />Secondly the book is pretty gratuitous at times. I don't think my younger friends really needed to read about oral sex.<br /><br />Lastly the book doesn't make a lot of sense though I am told it gets clearer as you read the other books.<br /><br />So overall i'm not going to read the second one and honestly the book straight up just was not good.

0307593495|5.0|When Linda told Kurt Wallander she was pregnant, she took him to the same beach where she told him she was going to be a police officer.  This time Kurt was much happier.  But something troubled him and he couldn't remember what it was.  Linda's lover/boyfriend/fiance (Hans) came from an upper class family who had been involved in the Swedish Military for at least four generations.  His father had been a submarine commander and involved in Swedish defense most of his life.  At seventy-five Haken von Enke was still active and on top of his game.    On the night of the party for his seventy-fifth birthday, Haken takes Kurt aside and tells him a story of Cold War collaboration and spying.  But he never comes to a conclusion of the story which leaves Kurt perplexed as to what it all means  At the same time Kurt finds himself totally confused as to where he is, who he is, and what he is doing where he is.  The doctors that Kurt visits tell him that he is fine but that stress can do strange things to peoples minds.      One day on his regular daily walk, Haken disappears, no one (including Kurt) can find any evidence of what happened to him.  It's like he vanished off the earth.  A few months later, his wife Louise goes missing and Kurt is determined to find out what is going on.  Needless to say I can't say anymore without revealing the truth of the story.  I just need to say that fans of Kurt Wallander should be very satisfied with this book and the ending.    Zeb Kantrowitz
B004SBX112|3.0|Glad to see the update hit the Amazon Appstore... However, I'm unable to update my version through Amazon or Android Market. Anyone know a fix for this? I know I'm not the only one, my friends are experiencing the same issue
B004FOA84A|2.0|Droid x would force close almost everytime I opened it. When it did work the game was fun but very short. 30 mins to beat.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I am not sure what is happening with some of the other reviews but this game works wonderfully on my Xoom!! I love this kind of puzzle game much in the lines of Myst and hope to see more like it for Android. I had a lot of fun playing it and it would be great to see an update in the future with more levels.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game started out great but after playing for an hour I went to use one of the clues that I picked up that was critical to continue and it was missing from my bag. I restarted the game thinking I dropped it somewere but this time it started doing the same thing again only sooner.  Every time I picked up cetrtain new pieces it would replace other items I had, and therefore would have to start over again. Very dissapointing, the game showed so much promise.    *Samsung epic*
B0030Y11XS|2.0|Michael Moore blames \\"capitalism\\" for the economic problems in this country. He is mistaken; it is \\"corporate socialism\\" that is at fault.    When the judge (in the documentary) was sentencing juveniles into a privatized detention complex, we viewers are led to believe that this is an example of capitalism run amok. Wrong! Because this involved government money being funneled into a private company, it's really corporate socialism.    In contrast, within a \\"free enterprise\\" system, private companies are allowed to succeed or fail on their own merits -- without government subsidies. Michael Moore needs to do his homework.
B004FOA84A|2.0|With all the necessary stuff, and the fact that this won't install to the SD card, this is impossible to install on my Android. Nice idea, BUT . . . Really sucks that it wasn't written better.

B004FOA84A|1.0|Every time I try to play game it crashes and phone does a force close. I want to play a game. The only grisly thing I see is the reviews.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a nice headset, very comfortable, the sound is crisp and clean, even at long distances from the computer.  The customizable buttons on the headset are a plus.  Battery life is fantastic.  They look great and the cable management for the charger is very good.    A few negatives include interference with other 2.4 Ghz devices if they are in the same room.  I cannot use our baby monitor and have the headset in the same room.  The bass is distorted with the default settings for most games, had to adjust the levels to make it work properly.    Overall I think this headset is worth the money for being wireless.  If you do not need wireless, buy one that is wired that has better quality and zero interference.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Can't help it, know I shouldn't- but I still love this series.  Such a strange premise - high school chemistry teacher teams up with former (awful) student to make and sell meth, yet, it works.  My husband and I found ourselves wondering with each episode what could possibly happen next.
B00008D1NF|5.0|Marisa Monte, Calinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes are well known contemporary Brazilian artists.  Combining their creativity in one CD with original songs is pure pleasure.  Buy the DVD and you will have an even better understanding of how imaginative, collaborative, and musically rich their work is.  This CD is guaranteed pleasure for the lovers of Brazilian music or simply music lovers in general.  As typical with Brazilian music, this work goes beyond using standard musical instruments, they use a variety of acoustic objects from rain fall to music box, from bells to whistles...  all harmonically and melodically integrated into the songs.  Simply put a collection of the best there is.  I've had this DVD for years and haven't listened to it in a while.  Just tonight I played it back after adjusting the surround settings on my equipment and again was amazed by how beautiful these songs are.  You cant go wrong with this CD or the DVD.
B00425S1H8|5.0|install the included driver, plug in the cable and it works just fine. it does exactly what is described in the literature. this is the way plug and play is supposed to be! no settings, just plug it in and get to work.
B004FOA84A|1.0|On my Samsung Galaxy S the game did not resolve the last puzzle, got all three wheels to light up but nothing happened. Stepped back to try to open the door several times but nothing happened.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This is a puzzle game that reminds me of Myst. However it only takes a couple of hours to finish. Easy controls and graphics. A longer game would make it a five star app. Not bad if you pick it up for free today.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Love this type of game, would have given more stars but way too short. Last puzzle was a little odd. I don't have 25 words for this review.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game. Graphics and music were perfect. Too short though, Needs more levels or sequel. Worked perfectly on galaxy phones.please give us more asap! C
B004FOA84A|3.0|It is way to short.  Good concept, graphics, challenging puzzles, but does not take long to go through.  It was worth the free download load but no way worth paying for. There is about a half dozen puzzles and a lot of searching for objects to place in things to open the next clue or puzzle.  Then the end is pretty stupid and anti climactic.
0553805460|4.0|This book is so entertaining and very well written... no one boring moment! So many times I laughed out loud. Would definitely recommend to others.
B004FOA84A|1.0|downloaded the game and I am not even able to open the game.  keeps stating that an unexpected error occurred and force closes. please fix for the  HTC evo.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a very fun game and plays kinda like an extremely simplified MYST. The environments are well drawn and the puzzles are OK, if a bit easy.     My main problems with this game is that some of the rooms in this game are a challenge to find since there is no visual information indicating that you can travel in the required direction. I am not talking about hidden passages or anything, I am talking rooms that are part of the main house. If you know they are there you can get to them easily but if you don't know they are there they are nearly impossible to find.    My other problem with the game is that once you do find all the rooms of the house, it is very short. Like half an hour short. That is fine for a free game (I got it free) but I don't know that I would want to pay for a game and find out that it only takes half an hour to complete. Especially since puzzle games like this have very little replay value since you already know the solutions.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Reminds me of the flash games on newsgrounds. Loved it and looking forward to more games like this. I hope there is a sequel in the works. Worked fine on HTC incredible.
0061537969|5.0|This book will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you fall in love with Enzo. Probably my favorite book ever.
B004FOA84A|4.0|good puzzles and a fun distraction.  My only complaint is that I wanted it to keep going.   Looking forward to further work from this developer or maybe just more levels added to existing game.   Remimded me of playing Maniac Mansion as a kid.
B00005B1W5|1.0|This is my third update of this particular album (VHS, CD, DVD) and though most of Yanni's work leaves me yawning, the Tribute album ranks in my top five ATF's.  And the venues are gorgeous! (The Taj Mahal, and The Forbidden City.)  But the bass is so amplified on this DVD that I wonder if this a bootleg copy.  This is the only CD or DVD in my entire collection that I find it neccessary to turn max down the bass.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game is full of fun, casual puzzles. The graphics and sounds are pretty decent. My only complaint is how often this app force closes, especially when starting it up.
B0014BEDBG|4.0|I like Justin's music but I am not a Superfan, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The concert takes place at Madison Square Garden and is in the round.  Justin belts out many of his solo hits and the NSync track Gone, record producer Timbaland joins Justin for Sexy Back and another song.  I use concert dvds to workout while on the exercise bike and I am able to get at least an hour of up tempo songs from this concert.  The band, background singers and dancers make this an eventful and enjoyable show.
B004FOA84A|1.0|the game is fine but missing inventory makes it unfinishable. played twice, first time mallet went missing. second time the wooden box.hope a fix comes out soon.
B004FOA84A|1.0|It won't run on my Optimus V! Keeps on force closing! Too bad! It looked fun! I am so glad it was FREE! It must mean that I should get up and clean something! It's a sign! :P
B004GHNHVW|5.0|I'm just a raindrop in a bucket  A coin dropped in a slot  I am an empty house on Weed Street  Across the road from the vacant lot  You know life is what you make of it  So beautiful or so what...    Paul 'Simon is one of the most gifted artists of his generation, right up the there with Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and John Lennon. He has a pleasant though not spectacular voice ( imagine signing with Art Garfuncle!) with limited range that he exploits so effectively. It is his incredible sense of rhythm, his concise lyrics that always leaves space for the listener's imagination.and his remarkable good taste that puts him, on his best days, head and shoulders above anyone else.    In reading reviews of his new offering, So Beautiful or So What, I find many attempts to compare this album with Graceland.  In my view, nothing can be compared with Graceland.  Every artist is entitled to his or her masterpiece. There just won't be another Graceland and this is no exception. That said. this is simply the best record to come out in the second decade of the second millennium. That is, if like me, your taste for music dates to the 60's.    Here is Simon is all his playful.lyrical,whimsical ways dealing with love, God, and family, But  there is always  an awareness of the present just a line away: The war, the environment, poverty, politics, and the commercialization of art. On Questions for the Angels in one line he goes from JZ selling cloths on a billboard to this:    If every human on the planet  And all the buildings on it should disappear  Would a Zebra grazing on the African Savannah  Shed one Zebra tear?    On \\"The Afterlife\\" he finally meets his Maker and is so struck with awe that all he can mutter is \\"Be-bop-a-lu-la\\"    On the infectious  opener, Getting Ready for Christmas Day, Simon uses the 1941 recorded voice of a black preacher imploring his flock to \\"get ready\\". It works brilliantly and tells you right from the get-go that this is not just a record, it is an album.Above all SBOSW is musical.  The uptempo numbers make you want to get up and dance your ass off.The rhythms are African, Caribbean, Cajun, blues, and, well, pure Simon. No one does it better.    Be-bop-a-lu-la    RHL  April 2011
0415575397|5.0|SOME TRENCHANT COMMENTARY ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF JUSTICE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Does the architecture of a court building necessarily affect the outcome of the trials that take place within its walls? You might say it shouldn't. But Linda Mulcahy, Professor of Law at the London School of Economics, argues convincingly that it might... and presents a body of overwhelming evidence that it does!<br /><br />Mulcahy asserts that the legitimacy of the trial derives from the setting in which its rituals take place - in other words: prescribed procedures...codes of conduct...the law itself...and the resulting documentation.<br />`Public buildings,' she states, `can both inspire and degrade those within them; they can calm or oppress.'<br /><br />We are tempted to digress here by saying that this utterance should be carved into the stonework on the front of the RIBA's London HQ in Portland Place - just to remind those guys to have a care in designing public edifices such as court buildings, in which decisions are made that affect the lives of others, often for generations.<br />Ms Mulcahy also quotes the American Chief Justice Hennessey, who, in 1984, pointed out that `our courthouses...are not merely buildings, rooms and furniture, but are rather monuments that evoke several centuries of human effort and progress'.<br /><br />Describing her book quite modestly as a monograph, Mulcahy reveals her extensive and detailed knowledge of this surprisingly vast subject in closely argued yet graceful prose. We've used the word `surprisingly' because, as is pointed out, there is rather a dearth of comment, or research or informed observation on this subject... so far.<br /><br />Published by the Routledge Law, this important book indeed deserves urgent and critical attention. If barristers and commentators like us find themselves dismayed by the often forbidding exteriors of so many courts, as well as by the almost complete lack of basic amenities for those who use them - we can only imagine how much and how ordinary people - including innocent witnesses - are thoroughly -- and unnecessarily -- cowed and intimidated.<br /><br />Legal dinosaurs (and there are plenty still about) who think that courts should strike terror into the souls of all who venture therein will not like this book. Most practitioners, though, will heartily welcome this clear-eyed examination by an incisive mind, of the very real issues of `legal geography' raised in this very readable work - especially in the light of new technologies which now assist the processes justice.<br /><br />To facilitate further research and inquiry, the book lists sources, cases and legislation- plus, there's an amazing sixteen page bibliography, and useful index at the back to dispel the myth that they are just `mere buildings'!se who use them - we can only imagine how much and how ordinary people - including innocent witnesses - are thoroughly -- and unnecessarily -- cowed and intimidated.

B004I1AGTM|4.0|I can't speak for everyone, but this was how I've come to enjoy this series of movies:   1) I saw a jaw-dropping clip of the first movie and was swept by the elegant yet brutal fight choreography.   2) After researching reviews on Amazon by those who've seen it already, I struggled to find it and was ultimately disappointed that it hadn't hit our shores yet.  3) Patiently waited, thanks to the distractions of life.  4) Saw it in Walmart one day and was so excited that I used my feet to purchase it.   5) Watched it and was thankful to all Gods that it was not some complete throwback to the time when Kung Fu movies had some weak plot carried by poor actors that served as filler in between fight scenes.  I cared about the characters for the actors carried them well, it had roots in actual history and the portrayal of it wasn't goofy, and after it had ended and the credits rolled, there was yet another reason why I respected it, that Ip Man was an actual historical figure, key in training a martial arts icon: Bruce Lee...kick ass!  Finally, the cherry of all revelation, the second one was on it's way (of course to our American shores for I was sure that the film had probably been enjoyed and is old news in its country).   6) Patiently waited yet again though I supplemented my anxiousness having seen many trailers on YOUTUBE, though they weren't as much of a spectacle as the first clip that won my interest, but seeing the first film in its entirety had won my faith, so I kept myself excited.  7) I caught a fan-edited trailer which included at the end the arrival of a young Bruce Lee into Ip Man's school...kick ass! I found a reason to reinstate my full excitement on par with the anticipation I had with the first film.  8) Saw it in Walmart one day (the wait being a lot shorter than with the first film) and was so excited to buy that I purchased it with a dowry of cattle and blocks of goat cheese.  9) Watched it and something happened: I found myself just watching it, not with the fervor of a clapping seal eyeballing a fish mid-toss, my viewing of it had a remarkable lack of the \\"oooooooooooo\\" of an down-turned axe kick hammering someone's upturned jaw, nor did it have the \\"daaaaaaaaaaaamn\\" of Ip's use of random objects to repel multiple opponents. After watching to the point to where Ip's wife hands him their newly born child I paused it and wrote this immediately...AS A WARNING...DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM HOPING TO FIND THE SAME SPECTACLE THAT ATTRACTED YOU TO THE FIRST, BUT RATHER BY THIS FILM FOR THE LOVE OF THE WISE AND RIGHTEOUS MOUNTAIN OF INTEGRITY OF IP MAN'S CHARACTER!!!!  It does have very good fight scenes but those scenes don't seem to be the emphasis, instead they are second to the man...that is the IP MAN (yes I realize that was a cheap kernel of corn).  After the viewing and the credits rolled, I am very happy that I bought this as a continuation of the character's story, and when I think of it, wishing that there should have been better fight scenes seems rather...selfish of me.  It was great to see Samo Hung again, and seeing old characters return to resume their roles but have become totally different people (we don't see the development which is an acceptable shame, the pace and story would have drug). I did enjoy this film thought not in the same way as the first, it's more about the struggle of life after war, it's emotional and at times as uplifting as the first, especially after Ip Man rising above but still being the modest and gentle soul that he is(except when he's bashing your nuts in with a wooden pallet but if that happened it's more likely because you were being an ass).  10) I like this film and would understand if others won't find it as entertaining as the first and detest it, maybe even say it is boring, to that I say that Samurai Power Rangers now comes on in the afternoon on Nickelodeon...go...and be at peace...
B004FOA84A|1.0|rebooted phone while it was trying to start.  keeps forcing close.  glad it was the free app if the day bc it's not even worth the .99.  Droid incredible.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game has some nice graphics.  It was decent fun completing the puzzles.   I just wish there was more.  The end implies there is more to come.  Where is it?

B004FOA84A|3.0|Decent game with a few challenges (the clock took a minute for me to figure out). The ending appears to have been written by a 3rd grader and there are a few glitches here and there, but nothing to detract to much from the gameplay.
B0011Z5CV0|3.0|This toy was a gift for my 5 month old son. The online product description and pictures look interesting. However, the toy turned out to be quite a disappointment. The musical notes on the trunk are quite hard to press even for an adult. The music does not last long at all. The only attactive features are the vibrant colors and the feet which make a crackly noise. Also, the ears are shaped like loops which makes it easy for my baby to hold on to the toy.
B004FOA84A|3.0|but force close on DROIDX running gingerbread whenever I exit and try to relaunch.  have to restart phone to launch the game again.  I will keep checking for updates.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it....best update and game hands down...graphics are awesome as well. The movie is great too..just need to come out on wii, xbox or ps3 as a game
B004FOA84A|3.0|Pros: very nice graphics mostly intuitive puzzles good use of touchscreen  Cons: waay too short;  I hope the developers come out with a feature-length follow-up the music is good but gets repetetive fast while the puzzles are intuitive, they're mostly a little too obvious  Bugs: when I balanced the scales, I got a message about the wrench instead opening and closing the hardware keyboard on my Samsung Epic forced the app to restart (without losing progress)
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I have to say that Black Swan caught me completely off guard. Watching the trailers I thought it was the typical underdog movie where a ballerina overcomes the obstacles and becomes the \\"Swan Queen\\". When I saw it in theaters, it was a completely a different experience. Black Swan is about a ballet ballerina but her biggest obstacle is herself. Being raised by an over-protective mother and being treated like a child, poor Nina never has \\"loosen herself\\". Her primal goal it's to be perfect and when her director casts her as the Swan Queen in the new production of Swan Lake she pushes herself to the limit both physically and mentally to be able to transform herself into the virginal White Swan and the seductive Black Swan effortlessly. This will cost her sanity and ultimately she succumbs to dementia.<br /><br />Black Swan is such a crazy film in the good sense of the world. It's a psychological thiller that captures you since the very beginning and never let you go until the very end. Aronofsky's direction is bold and masterful and the cast is superb. Natalie Portman carries the picture spectacularly and the film wouldn't have the same impact if it weren't for her masterful performance. She really earned her Oscar.<br /><br />Black Swan is without a doubt one of the best pictures of last year and with an excellent direction, wonderful score and spectacular performances this thriller will take you in a roller coaster of high quality entertinment.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Black Swan arrives on BD with a great transfe. Filmed with a variety of cameras, the film has a thick grain structure and skin tones are really detailed. Blacks are solid and there are no signs of compression artifacts or other anormalities. A great picture transfer by Fox. Likewise the 5.1 DTS-HD MA  is a great companion to the picture enhancing the score and providing a solid audio presentation. Dialogues are crisp and clear. Well done Fox.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />You have some goodies in the bonus features department. First and most important is the documentary \\"Black Swan Metamorphosis\\" which deals with all the aspects of the production of the film. It's a great documentary. Then also you have short promotional featurettes dealing with the ballet, production design, costumes, cast profiles and interviews and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />A digital copy is also offered.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Black Swan is an instant classic and has a lot of good qualities that makes this film a must-own title. With great video and audio and a good quality of bonus features this BD is highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good movie.t.

0740797719|5.0|I have a large library of instructional books and training videos. When I need to learn some new skill, I look for a book that will get straight to the point - hand over all the secrets without holding anything back. Usually, I end up disappointed to find that the amount of actual knowledge being passed on is minimal and it tends to be hidden in flowery language or egotistical rambling. Occasionally, a book or video will surprise me with rich content but I had never found that stripped down tome of all-knowledge that I really wanted. Until now, that is! Yeah, it's a big build-up but Color and Light is just that good! So is the book that preceded it, Imaginative Realism. Quite simply, it teaches you what you need to know in order to be able to understand what we are seeing and trying to capture in our own paintings.<br /><br />I wish every instructional book could be like this...
B002MXA7TC|3.0|As many others before me, I first heard \\"Sweet Disposition\\" which led me to find out the name of the band and eventually to buy this cd.  I initially heard the song in the movie theater commercial for Diet Coke (embarrasingly enough).  I often refrain from writing reviews of music because I get slammed by those who either really hate the music I love, or really love the music that leaves me nonplussed.  Ultimately, I like this cd.  I don't love it.  It took at least six listens for me to really enjoy anything other than \\"Sweet Disposition\\", and that is quite a long time by my standards.  Occasionally on a whim I'll just buy the whole cd without hearing multiple tracks from a certain artist and I like about half of their songs from the first listen.  It just didn't happen here.  This cd is quite pleasurable for car rides or doing something around the house, but it is not the type of cd I would put on my ipod and rock out to.  Just bein' honest, people.  We all have different tastes but for me it was a very slight letdown after reading reviews that liked other songs on \\"Conditions\\" as much or more than \\"Sweet Disposition\\".  I don't think that will happen for me.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Like many others, I was excited to get this one for free! Looked like a great game, but would force close every time I tried it. Too bad. Won't work on my LG Optimus V or my Nook Color with Phiremod 5.3.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I like these kind of games and this one was presented well, but it crashed on me a few times, and I blazed through it in about an hour.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Not only did it keep force closing, but it was a bit buggy. For example, it would replace random item with another every once in a while. For instance, it replaced my wrench with something else even before I could use it in the bathroom, with no way to get it back other than to reset the game.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Excellent!  It's a shame his life had to end so early.  Michael Jackson was a perfectionist of art.  He surpasses Elvis Presley as the King in singing and dancing.  I feel bad for those dancers that were chosen to work with Michael that is was so short lived.
1569242739|2.0|I couldn't wait to get this cookbook, and with all of the rave reviews all over the web, I was sure I'd be baking vegan confections that would even make my meat eating husband eat his words. While the recipes are creative and the book is adorable, the recipes just don't live up to the hype. I have baked four recipes from the book (plus three frosting recipes) and they have all turned out dense, somewhat chewy, and even on the dry side. I am not a novice baker by any means, so I really don't think it was anything I did. I wish I had taken this out from my library and tried a recipe before I spent the money. I'm really disappointed!
B004FOA84A|5.0|People leaving negative reviews need to realize that the developer has to make this work across hundreds of different phones. Just because it's Android, doesn't mean all Androids work the same! EMAIL THE DEVELOPER IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM ! It's the only way to get it fixed. Save your review for an honest, working, tried out the app, opinion!   This app is absolutely wonderful! If you like games like &quot;Mist&quot; you will love this!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Solved in less than 20 minutes....too easy to figure out. Good game, but disappointed it was not longer and more challenging. Please add more levels to the game!
B004FOA84A|3.0|It is a good game but short finished it already.  no replayability. I couldn't turn the sound off or down. worked on the moto droid.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ, this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution, it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Where do I start with this movie? The movie Rango was a good movie overall with a good theme and great graphics.  After this movie I wanted to be in a shoot out.  But besides that I think that the message of the movie was to complicated for children.  It seems that it would fly by children's head.  There were somethings that seemed unsuitable for a children's movie.  For example, the language they had was a bit extreme for children.  They used words in the movie like \\"Son of a ....\\", who was not able to finish phrase because he got carried away.  The complex theme of this movie also had me considering why this was a children's movie.  You have a lizard that is look for who he really is in life.  A misunderstood character.  Most children do not think about this growing up and seems that it was aid at an older audience then children.  If I had to rate this movie I would give it a pg-13 rating.  Not just because of the complex theme but because of the language and references to sexual things.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Works as expected.  User interface makes layout of information easy to read and interpret.  The expanded keyboard makes search entry fast and easy.  A plethora of examples included to get you started.  Worth the $2 by far.  Quick response & low resource use; runs smooth on HTC Incredible.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Glad it was free because I'd be ticked if I paid anything for this. I liked the puzzles but gameplay was remarkably short, less than 2 hours for me. :(  And 16mb with no app to SD? Unacceptable. Uninstalled.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I've been a Bonamassa fan for several years, and I've watched as he's gained acceptance as a certifiable blues guitarist, yet I still feel that he's under rated.  I'm not sure what it is about a guitarist that brings them to the forefront of musical capability, the likes of what Stevie Ray Vaughan had before he passed away, but whatever it is, it hasn't quite reached Bonamassa yet.  However, Bonamassa has all the right stuff.  He's an exceptional guitarist and I do feel that at some point he'll break through.  Dust Bowl is a very good display of his talent, demonstrating not only his musical ability, but also his song writing and singing abilities.  For the most part, he's straight forward; in your face, hard core, just this side of rock, blues.  His solo's are incredible, and his vocals are gutsy and strong.  Dust Bowl is but another step toward his ultimate consideration as one of the best guitarist around.  I think he deserves it!

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The Foo Fighters continue to demonstrate their versatility and musical strength with this album.  There's plenty of heat here, mixed with cord changes, mood inspirations, and straight ahead rock which we've come to expect from the Fighters.  This is a musical treat for anyone who likes good solid (talented) rock and roll.  So much out there these days is simply in your face walls of sound without any substance.  The Foo Fighters have substance, and they please on all levels!
B002ZG994U|1.0|Absolutely no plot -something about stolen US monetary plates-by Iran while fighting in Iraq- that only the A Team can solve.  Lots of exploding cars/tanks/drones/helicopters and noise.  According to this movie, The A Team is capable of fighting the entire wars in Iraq and Afghanistan- solo.  The dialogue is ridiculous and someone please explain  what Jessica Biel's character is doing in the movie. Her part is so unbelievable-that her actual function within the movie is a big plot mystery.  The entire movie makes absolutely no sense.  Add 1 star if you are a 10 year old boy.  If you are an adult, check your brain at the door-prior to watching.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app will not even launch on the motorola xoom. If it wasn't free today, and I had paid for it I would be very irritated.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors brings to life the saying that history is people. A wonderful production,marvelous acting and for the most part,historical accuracy. Poetic license is kept to a minimum and the bonus disc explains many of the customs of the day. If one thinks that current day politics are bad,watching the Tudors will give one an entirely different perspective! Some of the torture scenes are off-putting  but that's the way it was. For me it stimulated interest in the time period and led to further investigation of Henry VIII,who turned out to be much more interesting than anticipated. Money well spent!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Although the game is short, it is only 99c. I feel I got more than I paid for. Works great on the droid x. Maybe all these whiners just need a reliable phone...
0321543726|5.0|Just finished reading it from cover to cover, including the appendices and glossary. The book was written primarily for college students and beginners, but as stated on the back cover, \\"practitioners and advanced students will gain new insight and guidance by seeing how a recognized master approaches the elements of his art,\\" which has turned out to be so true. The two other C++ books also written by Stroustrup and listed in the bibliography on p.1179 -- \\"The Design and Evolution of C++\\" and \\"The C++ Programming Language\\" -- are absolutely masterpieces as well.    The only drawback in this book I noticed: there are some typos and errors, sometimes obvious. They were likely because of the publisher's rushing to press to meet the deadline. One can find corrections in the online errata (separate pages for three different printings).

B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a fun game, though it is a little short, still worth downloading. I would give it 4, but I feel I have to offset the many 1-star reviews that I feel are invalid.  I hate to see a bunch of 1-star reviews just because the app force-closed on your device. that may not completely be the developer's fault, especialky if you're using a &quot;leaked&quot; os. How about sending a report to the devs and wait to review the app when you can review it based on the app's functionality, usefullness, and level of enjoyment, which is what reviews are for, not for bug reports.
B004FOA84A|1.0|force closes when you try and run the game. doesn't even work on the motorola xoom. Pictures look good for the game to bad I can't play.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Inspirational, great acting, great everything. Finally, a great movie that isnt filled with a lot of nonsense garbage. I could watch this over and over. Just a beautiful story.
B004FOA84A|5.0|dont know why every one is complaining. its a game for a phone. not ps3. was short but fun. didnt crash on evo shift. ran fine and hope more games like this come out for android
B004FOA84A|5.0|First off I am not a gamer I only downloaded this for my son to play. I had to try it though. The graphics are amazing and the hunt for clues and how to use them is so much fun. This game is very addictive. I am now anxious for the sequel. Try it. It's free and you won't be sorry.
B004CR7TE2|5.0|Back when I bought my macbook air I bought my first sleeve from this company and was highly impressed.<br /><br />When Apple released the new laptop series this year (quad cores) I got very excited and started looking for a nice sleeve that I could use when I bought the laptop.<br /><br />Somehow automagically, I got offered this sleeve and it fits the bill perfect.<br /><br />One cool feature about this sleeve is the pockets on the front, this is just amazing.  (They are roughly 7 inches wide, and you get 2 separate compartments.)<br /><br />I have room to store some legal pads, cards, you could even put your passport possibly a small kindle (mine's the dx so I can't test) all thanks to this wonderful sleeve!<br /><br />I love it!  and I can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sleeve that not only looks good (this does) but also has great function (the pockets really set this guy apart) you can do no wrong by picking this up today.
B004FOA84A|3.0|A great game but has 2 problems. 1, it's a bit short. 2, cannot move to sd card. The game is too large to be left on some phones.  If it wasn't for those 2 problems it would have 5 stars.  Google nexus s
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I liked the app. I even liked the fact that you could link online. What I didn't like was the fact that you could share information/lists with your friends.<br /><br />I like my data to be stored on my device and not in the cloud by some company that I'm not familiar with. Tried the app for a few days, then I uninstalled it.<br /><br />******* Update *****<br /><br />I have since started using Evernote - and storing data in the cloud. I'm not sure... there was something about that app that made me take the plunge.
6305090564|1.0|I'm very surprised at the positive reviews on this film. I started to watch it for the first time today and could barely take much more of it. Really bad acting, uninteresting charactors and flat \\"humor\\".  This ranks as bad as the movie \\"Solar Crisis.\\" I've seen Treat Williams in others movies and he was sometimes pretty good. Someone told him how to act in this bomb, to turn on the supposedly witty, carefree, tough-guy act. It's unbareable to see. The supporting actors are all trying desperatly to raise the bar only to raise the embarassment level. It's overacting nonsense.                         I actually decided to watch it based on a review at the web site All movie .com. Three stars, and the word \\"gem\\" was mentioned! This is a 90s flick that cost mega-millions to make and no wonder I never really heard much about it. Have we been reduced to actually giving this sort of garbage a pass. I buried it where it belongs in my forgotten mess pile.
B004FOA84A|3.0|16 MB and no app to SD?   Really?  Are you freaking kidding me?  Uninstalled until your company learns to better take its customers into consideration.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|When I think of it, this movie should feel cheesy. Some sets look like they'll blow away, special effects noticably of the time, conversations where you know what cliche is going to be said before they do, and a goofy robot who is now a cliche.<br /><br />But the story line is so interesting, Walter Pidgeon lends authentic gravitas, Anne Francis is such the innocent kitten, and Leslie Nielsen, even in a serious role, makes you smile - and so, it all hangs together wonderfully with a theme that certainly feels like it could be Shakespeare, whether or not &quot;The Tempest&quot; actually inspired the script.<br /><br />I finally broke down and bought the DVD because our VHS was wearing out.  Our teenagers like the film as much as my husband and I do, and that's saying something. One of them, for example, is a 14 year old boy with whom I recently had this exchange:<br /><br />Me:  &quot;Well, you know, I was watching movies long before CGI.&quot;<br />Son:  &quot;... and a bleak and desolate place it was!&quot;<br /><br />Happy Reader
B0041CGP02|1.0|Jon Bon Jovi is the typical \\"my folks are rich and they realize that I am never going to amount to anything - AT ALL - so, hey, lets make a 'rock musician' out of me.\\"  Sure, Jon's cousin Tony Bongiovi is a record producer/engineer - I mean, he was all over the Ramones second 2 albums, and, from what I understand, he even put up $$$ for something called (sic) \\"John @ the Power Station.\\"  As you can imagine... Still...a cutesy first name change, and the \\"mighty-mousse\\" hair so stylish in the eighties...well, it didn't matter that lil' \\"Jon\\" had the vocal talent of an animated mouse, he was simply set up.

B004MGMJ3E|5.0|...and i think this and Person Pitch are considerably more endearing than anything either of those artists have released. Yet there is a grain of salt--somehow put there by naysayers. I can appreciate how the right mood or approach could render these songs somewhat purile with their swelling, wide-eyed cuddle-psych tendencies. But it's not as self-conscious or corny as Simon or Wilson (albeit open-heartedly) can frequently be and its much more about straight feel than doing a ditty in the place. You don't have to get high to like Tomboy, but it could easily be the thinking druggy's sunny day reverie. For those not knee-jerkingly mistrustful(Dusted's Brad LaBonte comes to mind) of wooze or ambiguity or drone, the music alone can be a high. To me it's like Person Pitch's stoic mirror opposite - still dense and swampy, but more concise and tentative. The almost stilted quality here is so ideal as to be expansive. The most song-oriented, \\"Alsatian Darn\\" is just remarkable. It's got that classic Lennox melodic propulsion and can and should be a popular single. \\"Afterburner\\" is a new high for the artist -- a windtunnel trance that puts fizz in your spinal fluid. While I don't like the backlash against this artist, I don't like some of the preciousness about him so I'll just watch myself here. This is a fantastic record, though there's for much for me to prefer about the previous one. Folks who call this overhyped should remember how many people we have lived or worked with that would never in a million years give it a second glance. It's a big world, and Panda Bear makes up his own little corner of it. Seems to me he's just been hyped beyond expectation, but no more than the music merits.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Good graphics and music. Fun to play but too short. Had a couple of force close problems but nothing I couldn't handle. I think my daughter would enjoy this as well.
B001B223TW|4.0|Great, and actually outstanding singing, but unfortunately the too dark stage almost destroys the whole performance. Light, light and more light is essential, even if the topic is DARK. SHOW THE DARKNESS of the STORY with LIGHT. Unfortunately this was not done in this performance, causing me to drop one star from my rating.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game plays just like the original angry birds but has some nicer visuals. It also has a Rio the movie tie-in.  You have to rescue tropical birds from cages in the earlier stages.  Overall its a very nice game well worth the price!

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I've been a fan of REM since I first heard '1 Million' on college radio in the early 80s. This album shows that the REM well has not run dry. They continue to write intriguing songs, melodically and lyrically, and arrange and perform them with confidence balanced with a tinge of tonque-in-cheek and wry humor. Their music can be serious but they don't take themselves too seriously, in my opinion. I'm not going to get into comparisons with the rest of their repertoire - which is so prolific and varied in style that one can only name favorite discs or periods, not qualifying one over the other. I am giving this one five stars because it has a warm quality. Overall, it's less edgy in feel than some of their more recent work. It has heart and, even, soul - listen to 'Oh, My Heart' and 'Walk It Back'. In other words, for me this album is a rewarding listen.
B0046W1692|5.0|After waiting for a few years it was worth it! Mana is the only Latin Group that i will still spend my money in buying the CD. My favorite song \\" Amor Clandastino\\" which remain me of \\"Labios Conpartidos\\" Great music and lyrics. Once again Mana have deliver a wonderful album!
0312330537|5.0|You have to read it believe it. Amazing from beginning to end. You have to buy this book. I'm an avid reader and this shook me. Just research the author and this will give you a taste of what you're in store for. A fantastically written masterpiece. BUY IT NOW if you enjoy books that you find difficult to stop reading. Wow!
1416955070|5.0|I was actually shocked to see the number of mediocre and poor reviews that this book got on Amazon. There are the inevitable comparisons to other series- Twilight and Harry Potter most notably among those. Currently, Young Adult paranormal lit is HOT, shows no signs of slowing, and anyone that can't deal with it needs to avoid those books. DUH. Also- teens are reading. Why does it matter that what's attracting them is vampires/werewolves/etc?<br /><br />I admit to being guilty of comparing a number of fictional worlds to Harry Potter, only because of how well Rowling created her universe. In this case, comparisons are apt as Ms Clare actually got her start writing some spot on Harry Potter Fan Fiction. Like Ms Rowling, Cassandra Clare has created a detailed supernatural version of New York, where everything is far more than meets the eye.<br /><br />Clary Fray is out at the Pandemonium Club with her best friend when she witnesses a murder. Not exactly your typical Saturday night fare. Even more strange is the fact that the murderers are a group of tattoed teenagers, that apparently only Clary (short for Clarissa) can see. Before she can become the NYPD's newest detective, the victim's body disappears, leaving her feeling like a crazy person.<br /><br />Fortunately, one of the tatted teens seeks her out the next day at a poetry reading, and introduces himself as Jace. She learns that he and his partners in crime are Shadowhunters, also known as the Nephilim, and charged with ridding NYC of demons and other nasty beasties.<br /><br />His timing is impeccable, as shortly thereafter Clary's mum is kidnapped by one of said nasty beasties, and Clary is forced to take refuge among the Shadowhunters. There, she learns that-- well, that would be spoiling a great deal of the plot, so I'll leave the summarizing there.<br /><br />(Other than this: right now? I am PEEVED at Ms Clare because of a certain plot point. She has 2 more books [actually 3, but I'm not in possession of the recently released fourth book. YET.] to resolve it, or we are not on speaking terms.)<br /><br />Let it suffice to say the book is a great deal of fun, and despite similarities to our other favorite Wizard/Vampire/Werewolf fiction, original enough to keep me very entertained. No, really. They made fun of me at the hairdresser this weekend because I had to bring in both \\"City of Bones\\" and \\"City of Ashes\\", heaven forbid I should finish one and be without a book.to resolve it, or we are not on speaking terms.)

B004SBX112|5.0|Unless it was a matter of perfect timing, I did a refresh of my apps and found the update waiting for the Easter version. This time you get to kill pigs with bunny ears.  Mmmmm! Hausenfeffer pork, or however it's spelled.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This dvd should be required viewing for anyone sitting on the fence of whether they should buy organic foods.  It's an eye opener for those that think they don't care or can't afford better quality food.
B002ZG98FU|2.0|It was ok. A little on the boring side (about as boring as Daybreak News). A couple of good parts, but that's about it.
0525951652|4.0|Book reminds me some of Winds of War / War & Rememberance by Herman Wouk. I've read over 600 pages and have enjoyed it very much.  Almost falls into the category of book that I can't wait to pick it up again.  Looking forward to the new two of the series.
0307887960|3.0|First off, let me say I'm an unlikely candidate for this Diet.  I'm a mostly-vegetarian (I eat seafood once in a while), but I'm a little overweight because of my sweet tooth.  My husband likes junk foods and snacking, so we've both got a bit of a problem.  We decided to try this because it says vegetarians can do it too, and we do eat fish.  Basically, for the first 2-5 days you eat nothing but protein (no carbs, no fruits or vegetables, no fat, no cooking oil).  This sounded do-able.  We were allowed unlimited fish, shellfish, tofu, seitan, fat-free yogurt and dairy, and eggs.  You also have to drink 1 1/2 quarts of water a day.    The book has a few recipes at the back, and in the section that talks about vegetarians, says to go to the website for more recipes.  At this time, the website has none.  I even checked the British site, and they also have none.  So I was creative and made a few things that turned out really good (we thought).  You're supposed to make \\"oat bran galettes\\" every morning, but I'm an American - I get up at the last minute, chow down what healthy item I can find, and walk to work.  I tried making some ahead of time in my food dehydrator, but it took forever and they tasted too weird.    I followed this diet very strictly for 5 full days, and overall, I felt like the food I ate on this diet was way more unhealthy than what I was eating before.  Almost everything was white and had little to no flavor.  I drank more water than he suggested, and my body stopped producing stool.  One egg has more cholesterol in it than almost anything else existing in nature, and I was eating about 3 a day!!!      That being said, I did see results.  The first two days I lost a few pounds, the next two days I lost nothing, and then I pushed it on the last day and lost a little more.  But it wasn't worth it.  I had absolutely no energy, and I often felt confused and forgetful, not to mention dizzy!  We started on a Monday, and by the time the next Saturday morning rolled around, we went for a walk in a park, and I got so weak I had to stop a bunch of times - whereas I usually walk about 3 miles a day with no problem.  My husband lost it and yelled \\"I hate this diet - your boobs are disappearing!!!\\"  So we decided to wean ourselves back on to our usual diet (to avoid rebound weight gain), using a few lessons I learned from the book.    In the book, Dr. Dukan says when you're losing weight, the amount of weight you lose in a day, it's to your body like you ate that amount of pure butter that day since it's coursing through your system on its way out.  This is terrifying.  And if you're predisposed to atherosclerosis, you should maybe look at a diet where you'll be losing weight more slowly.  I have gained back a few pounds since I stopped this diet, but I think I'd rather weigh a little more and enjoy myself and have energy than be super skinny and unhealthy and weak.      Just my opinion - hope this helps!
1427209758|4.0|Overview:<br />I listened to all 40+ hrs of the story on tape, so I can't comment accurately on any grammatical mistakes. The two narrators did a nice job with the story, but I was waiting for the story lines to intersect somewhere.<br /><br />Good: There are a lot of interesting characters and some really neat concepts. Who doesn't like the idea of mystical warriors who can summon blades of light to valiantly fight the hordes of enemies. In short, a lot of cool ideas and characters you know a lot about. (I mean geez, you practically know hair-count on these guys by the end.)<br /><br />Bad: The CDs sometimes skipped (thanks very much, stupid library copy) so I'm pretty sure I missed a few parts. The crazy amount of backstory kind of muddled the \\"real\\" story. There's so much detail mixed with flashbacks and dreams that it's sometimes hard to keep the who's who straight. There's such a thing as too much of a good thing, and I think that comes up here. As a general rule of thumb, an author should work on the art of brevity if the book gets too crazy big.<br /><br />Conclusion: I definitely like Mistborn better. I'm never, ever (ever!) reading this book... when the sequels finally come out I'll probably (8/10 chance) borrow the CD from the library (chance at skippage notwithstanding).
B004FOA84A|4.0|I got is as free app of the day, but it's worth the buck for the hour's worth of gameplay you get out of it.  Had force close problems when starting it up a couple times but otherwise ran fine on my Epic.  Agree that the ending is lame.  don't really see the need for app to SDCard as it's the type of game you'll only play once through then uninstall.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|I had been looking forward to watching this movie since I first heard about it in theaters. Unfortunately, I missed it on the big screen but I was first in line to rent it! Though I am glad that I watched it, I wasn't as enthralled as I thought I would be.     The story is about a 28 year old woman who has just been fired from her job as a morning show producer. When she lands a as the producer of \\"Daybreak\\", she makes it her mission to raise the show from the depths of morning-show despair to the heights of \\"The Today Show\\". Of course there is something standing in her way, a crotchety Harrison Ford who is a veteran newscaster. She tries to coax him to join the show but his appearance on \\"Daybreak\\" has the opposite effect than she had desired. In order to save her career and the show, she must find a way to reign in Ford before it's too late.    I think that the best word to describe this movie is \\"cute\\". Rachel McAdams plays a delightful spunky producer who has boundless energy and spirit. Harrison Ford plays an exceptional curmudgeon the likes of which have not been seen since \\"Grumpy Old Men\\". However, the film is still lacking. It was overly predictable even for a chick film. The acting seemed stilted and shallow. Though there were certainly a couple laughs, I wasn't as tickled by the film as I thought I would be. It certainly has some charm, but not enough to be memorable.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Lots of fun...made my brain hurt.  FC a lot on DX...just have to try to open again. Look forward to an update. Should be free in the market though.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Stunning graphics on myp droid X. First time playing this game and I find very entertaining.  I'll be looking for more games from this developer.  Thank you very much.

B0006HB84Y|1.0|I met an old friend and he played me Josh Grobans''You Raise Me Up'.  It sounded lovely and I wanted to get that lovely love song.  I could not find the exact album on your Amazon site, so I chose something that might be near.  Well, I am very sorry to say that this CD is highly depressing to me; not uplifting at all; so in fact a total waste of money.  Also, what was confusing, it said that this CD was coming from the U.S.A. It had a price in dollars, 16 something.  I do not know what I have been charged and the ultra confusing link the the U.S. was very strange to me, but I went along with it.  If we get a huge bill my husband won't be happy!  Please, Amazon, make your site easier.  With many thanks, Helen of Troy.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this is a great start for a game series. this was short, but lots of fun. It felt more like an episode than a full game.  fc'd on first try, but opened again and it worked. running froyo on samsung galaxy s.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Too short to enjoy, too boring to be a good time waste. I was shocked to realize I had &quot;beaten&quot; this game. So glad it was free, or I would want my money back.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Great CD, however it came with a smudge on it that doesn't come off, so the last song on the first CD skips.  Not worth the shipping costs to send it back, so I'll probably use the free download that came with the order, to get that song.
B004GHNHVW|3.0|This music is as wonderful as ever, but Paul Simon seems to be getting a bit too spiritual for my tastes.     To each his own, of course, but I recommend this with a caveat regarding to lyrical content.    Fortunately, I got this on my Zune Pass, so it didn't cost me anything.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I liked this a lot.      PROS:  High intensity in a short period of time.  Not too difficult.  Jillian mixes things up.    CONS:  Too \\"shoulder\\" intensive.    SO MUCH of the strength moves involve the shoulders and static shoulder exercises and that just bugged me personally, but might not bother others.    I did like the workout a lot and felt like it was pretty productive.  Claims that it's hard on the body or knees were not legit as far as I was concerned.  Just follow the correct technique.
1936594293|5.0|I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game is perfect for me. I love the simplicity of the interface, I just want more. Is there a grandma in the picture? Maybe a whole series of inbred cousins?
B0040E5PWA|5.0|I've seen reviews that suggest that there's no real difference in sound quality between the stereo and mono versions of the White album remasters. The truth is: it depends on what track you're listening to. I can hear distinct differences in songs with acoustic guitars like, \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" \\"I Will,\\" etc. The mono version definitely sounds crisper. Songs with heavy bass are a little different. On the one hand sometimes the bass seems a little muddy on mono. But on some tracks it sounds richer and a little fuller. For example on \\"Long, Long, Long\\" there's a very low note that I used to hear on vinyl, but never heard it on the stereo CD. Well, I can hear it on mono. And all this time I thought my ears were failing.    It's a little odd to listen to \\"Revolution 9\\" on mono. I'm used to the sudden switching from channel to channel that runs throughout the track. So it sounds flat. But that's the only track that really suffers at all on mono.    There are a few tracks where the stereo and mono versions differ in arrangement, and it's fun to discover the differences. \\"Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" has a slightly different opening. \\"Yer Blues\\" sounds different. The most noticeable differences are on \\"Helter Skelter.\\" The endings are very different.    Oh, and on the mono, Ringo no longer has blisters on his fingers.
B003Y74AXO|4.0|I'm not a big fan of screen protectors.  They all seem to inhibit the feel of the iPad.  This one, however, is one of the best in my opinion.  Serves the purpose well but also doesn't seem to give that \\"somethings not quite right\\" feel I get with most screen protectors.

B001FB55HQ|1.0|If what you look for in a movie is a bunch of generic people spouting a bunch of generic duologue, this is the movie for you!    None of the charm, subtlety, depth, or focus of the first two Terminator's (or, dare I say, even the third) survived this adaptation. The locations are stale and lifeless, the people are as robotic and artificial as the CGI robots they're fighting, and only name recognition gives us any indication that this is even related to the original movies. I don't like any of these people, I don't care about any of these people, I'm not interested.      In the first three movies we got the sense that the protagonists were running away from a powerful and malevolent menace. Attempting to survive an implacable foe, in order to achieve a goal that meant the difference between humanity's survival and its annihilation. But here, the wooden, generic pod people run from a summer action blockbuster in order to survive long enough to set up another special effects shot.     Some lip service is given to the the issue of \\"identity\\" \\"choice\\" \\"free will\\" and \\"prejudice\\" but it's underused and unconvincing. It comes off as an attempt to 'remind' the audience that \\"Terminator\\" is about ideas, rather than actually presenting them.     The most I can say about this movie is that, as you watch it, you will quickly feel (as i did) as though you might as well be watching anything.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|Just wanted to leave a quick 5-star review, based on the book itself and not the publisher's price.  It's unfair to punish the author's ratings based on the price of the book!!!  I was hooked from page one.  I am new to Michael Connelly's work, but after reading The Lincoln Lawyer I searched out his other books with Haller as the main character.  I am not disappointed in the least bit.  If you don't like the higher price, then don't purchase it.... but don't leave a bad review unless the novel itself deserves it.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|loved the short and succint descriptions of each of the characters experiences and situations.  the scenarios were set up as if to answer any questions that the usual plot novel leaves unanswered...such as, strategic planning, forming of intelligent rescue teams, training dogs, spreading awareness, dealing with issues like deep sea floor clearing, and establishing new societies, etc.  makes one wonder if some of these ideas can be instituted in a real life catastrophic event.  maybe not with the living dead but more so with the dead living, the feral human or terrorist who like a zombie has no conscience or will to live.    very entertaining read with just enough encounters to bring up your pulse a tiny bit.      wonder if the movie will ever get made...the novel's set up leaves much opportunity for a succesful flick.
B000K1P66W|1.0|Unfortunately the book I ordered never arrived (The Four Agreements...).  They tell me it was lost in the mail.  I canceled my order and expect to see a refund for the book and postage soon.<br />R. Kropp
B003UESJH4|5.0|A nicely done DVD extras package although I was disappointed not to find the deleted scenes promised in the Amazon ad. And apologies to Anthony Andrews for the \\"making of\\" featurette: Tom Hooper mentions the members of his stellar cast but when he names Anthony Andrews (PM Baldwin) the film clip shown is of David Bamber (Theater Director). An inexcusable error.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Works great. Never force closed. If it closes on you the issue is not the game but actually the phone your running it on.definitely worth a play especially when free
B000W9399S|1.0|Given that this book has spawned over three dozen sequels, I should have suspected it would be less Tolkien and more Piers Anthony. The stock review is that it's what might happen if Douglas Adams had written fantasy. Except it's not very funny, and not very good.<br /><br />Might I have enjoyed this had I read it as a teenager? Maybe. But I'm not. It starts out only slightly dumb, but gets worse with every page. And the ending is just terrible.<br /><br />Boring, unfunny, and utterly pointless. Seriously, seriously awful.
B004FOA84A|4.0|No FC here, and the game looks great and is.fun. The only problem is that it took half an hour to complete. For a free game it was a great buy, but I'd have been mad if I'd paid for it.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|While not as impressive as \\"Bullet In A Bible,\\" this live CD/DVD provides an excellent account of the \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" tour. Old stuff, new stuff, stuff you haven't heard before, it's all here. It's a document of where the band is now - live and in person. Check it out if you're a fan. If you're not - well why the f**k not?
B000001ES9|5.0|\\"Rush,\\" the self-titled inaugural album by the Canadian band from Ontario, is a great and underappreciated effort that lurks in the shadows cast by such monster albums as \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Signals,\\" and \\"2112.\\" This album features the lineup of guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee, and the late drummer John Rutsey performing eight songs, each of which foreshadows even greater efforts in later works.<br /><br />The keynote song on the CD is \\"Working Man,\\" a great blue collar rock-and-roller that is still as vibrant in concert today as it was when recorded in 1974. (A version with a reggae introduction was my favorite in the entire set when I saw Rush at the Yum Center in Louisville recently.) People who stop listening after playing \\"Working Man\\" are robbing themselves, though: there really isn't a song on the CD that I don't like (which is unusual for me.) Besides \\"Working Man\\" my other two favorites are \\"What You're Doing,\\" a catchy uptempo number, and the laconic blues-intensive \\"Here Again.\\"<br /><br />The album certainly lacks the prog-rock tendencies and polish of later Rush efforts, but that doesn't mean this isn't a great album in its own right: comparing \\"Rush\\" with \\"Moving Pictures\\" is as inappropriate as comparing \\"Meet the Beatles\\" with \\"Abbey Road.\\" In both cases the albums are both great, but in different ways and for different reasons. While I generally prefer the incredible technical prowess of Neil Peart to Rutsey, I think Rutsey is solid on \\"Rush\\" and matches the understated nature of the material better than Peart would have. I especially admire Lifeson's guitar work here, it's conservative in comparison with later Rush recordings, but spot-on perfect at every turn, while Geddy Lee turns in an excellent and typically idiosyncratic vocal performance that presages his career as one of the most distinctive voices in rock.<br /><br />\\"Rush\\" is a great CD overshadowed by later and greater successes, but I recommend it to music lovers everywhere without reservation.rvation.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is simply the best CD by anyone I've heard in the past ten years.  Thank god real rock and roll is not dead.
B00014TJ6Q|4.0|To my ears, `Blow Away', `Love Comes to Everyone', and `If You Believe' are the outstanding Beatlesworthy tracks on this album. `Here Comes the Moon', `Dark Sweet Lady', `Soft Touch' and `Your Love is Forever' make up the send tier. `Not Guilty' is a remarkable song, on the `Beatles Anthology III' and on the bootleg `George Harrison: Rarities', but not here. Enough said: there's lots of Beatles action on this George L.P.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Amazing game great graphics.  Unreal how it gets 1 star from people who have a phone that FC' s ....ever think about maybe its your phone moron...maybe all the other Free crap on it is sucking up your memory. Anywho..Fantastic game!
B004RUF9DC|2.0|A complete deception, the graininess is so visible and distracting. This is the worst blu-ray release I ever seen. Very bad restoration work, nothing comparable to \\"The Ten Commandments\\" and \\"King of Kings\\".
B004FOA84A|1.0|I'm afraid to say that I have to agree with the others - I can't open this as it force closes on my DROID X.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game is surprisingly short. If you're any good at games like its, it will take you a half hour max to beat it. I thought I had beaten the first level when actually the game was over. Don't recommend, there are a million better uses for a dollar.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was addicting! I love that you actually had to think to play the game and solve the mystery. Worked fine on my DroidX.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is really fun imho. It is a simple game but there are a couple of real brain teasers in it. The game looked and performed flawlessly on my Galaxy Tab. If you like point and click games like Myst then I highly recommend it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I paid for this game before it was the free app of the day and it was worth it. It's has the right amount of complexity to keep you interested. I look forward to more games like this from the developer in the future.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Doesn't work at all. Forces close as soon as its opened... :-( LG Optimus T. Good thing it was free, or else id be really mad.
B004SBX112|2.0|So where is my update.  I see Easter edition icon but it doesn't update. Almost a week behind standard app market. Amazon your Appstore is starting to seem a little 2nd rate.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I loved this movie I loved the actors who were in it and the way they portrayed the characters. I have seen a couple adaptations of the book \\"Persuasion\\" and I think this one for me is the best version.  The only thing that made me sad was that it seemed to take so long in the movie for them to get together and then jump to sailing off into the sunset I would have liked to see a little more emphasis paid on after the engagement how people reacted and how her status in the family changed.  I have watched it numerous times and always find something new every time I watch it.  Great great movie wishing there was a sequel!!!!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|The best just keeps on getting better. DO NOT miss this CD....it is a MUST HAVE for fans of Joe!!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I think I have read practically every Jane Austen book and seen every movie adaptation I have been able to get my hands on and I have always wondered what it would be like to live as one of her characters in that time period or what would they think of the way things were now compared to then?  This dvd did a good job of answering that I liked that both women switched places so the viewer could see both scenarios and how each fit.  I wish they would have focused a bit more on what Lizzie did in the real, current time.  I liked how they made the viewer think about how there could be more to scandal or event (Mr. Whickam and Darcy's sister) then what was told.    The only thing I could have done without was the language was a bit much in certain areas and I wish they would tone that down. I wish the main character would have gotten into the time period and at least in one scene put her hair up but besides thatI felt it was very well done.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This brought back some  good memories of playing myst. While it did take me about 45 mins to complete, it was definitely worth the play. Oh ya...Its FREE! The reason its got such low ratings is probably because those idiots don't know how to solve basic puzzles. Download it!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun game! I was surprised how little battery it actually used too. Well worth the time! My only complaint is the end was kind of anti-climatic.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|When I heard that Britney Spears was making a new album I was like, \\"Whoa, is this really happening?!\\" because we know that her ex-husband Kevin is a total douchebag, has 2 kids of it, cut her hair, kissed Madonna, made a no-kids video \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", and even damaged a car. Well, she has changed quite a bit... NO MORE HATING HATERS! Also she's divorced Kevin, treats her kids motherly, won't cut her hair, is straight, still does explicit music videos (Um, that's her decision?), and payed for the car's damages... WHAT NOW?! *Sigh* Anyways! Even though I think Britney could've done better, in which all album's need improvement, has great album pictures and some likable songs as well. My favourite songs are: Till the World Ends, Hold it Against Me (Radio Remix), Seal it with a Kiss, Gasoline, Up 'N' Down, and Scary. In my opinion, the most played are \\"Seal it with a Kiss\\" or \\"Gasoline\\" because it has a groovy beat to the both. Otherwise, Britney did the best that she could to this album.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game!  Love it!  Thanks to the dev and to Amazon... the reviews would have kept me away were it not offered free.  Just love these Myst-style games.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Runs great on my Nook Color (nookie froyo)! A tad short, but easily one of the best Amazon free Apps. I'd buy an expansion if it ever comes out.
0596805527|4.0|Javascript: The Definitive Guide (Sixth Edition) is an excellent addition to the bookshelf of anyone who deals with Javascript on a regular basis.    Those having some prior exposure to Javascript should gain useful insights into the language while reading this book.   At over 1000 pages, the author has space and time to cover most topics in detail, although examples are relatively brief.    Some of the topics are necessarily dry, e.g., how Javascript handles semicolon delimiters, but even these are handled directly and without unnecessary \\"fluff\\".    The cover description of the book indicates that the intended audience is experienced programmers, and I would concur with that statement.  While it would be possible to learn all the elements of Javascript using this book, it is not a tutorial nor is it structured to tie language elements and practices together for the novice.  A reader who has written a few functions or debugged a web-based script should be at home with this text.    In addition to the narrative portions, the book is, of course, a reference to the Javascript language.  This was actually the segment of the book which I used most in previous editions.  It's handy for troubleshooting other people's code when you can't recall what a particular function does and cannot locate a simplistic example on the web.    Disclaimer: I was provided access by O'Reilly Publishing to an electronic copy of this book for review purposes.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I wish I wouldn't let my personal disdain for Tim Robbins continue to get in the way.  It was the main reason I stayed away from THE SHAWHANK REDEMPTION when it made its theatrical run; it was definitely the reason I never caught the film on cable--even after I had heard from countless folks what a fabulous movie it is.  And then recently I stumbled upon it late at night on one of the classic movie channels; the film was well underway, but as soon as I began watching I was hooked.  Subsequently I've seen it several times, rented it, and very much plan to add SHAWSHANK to my DVD collection.  Because--like or no like Robbins--THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the best movies of its--or any--era.<br /><br />Here we have a story of patience and persistence--a story of deep friendship and ultimate triumph.  In SHAWSHANK, a New England maximum security prison, as Morgan Freeman's character, Red, laments, \\"All a man has is time.\\"  So it's what you do with that time that measures a man's worth; for (wrongfully) convicted murderer and former banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins), he elects to eat that proverbial elephant, one bite at a time, because, as we eventually learn, he has the discipline and the fortitude to celebrate a victory of almost unthinkable proportions.  Pitted against a corrupt administration and a brutal prison culture, Andy has the patience and the persistence to score a stunning victory; his journey to the film's superb ending is spellbinding.<br /><br />Freeman and (yes, I have to admit) Robbins are spectacular; all of the cast is terrific, but special kudos to Bob Gunton as the sinister warden and the late great James Whitmore as Brooks, an aging lifer suddenly released back into the \\"real world\\"--a place he no longer recognizes, a place he now very much fears.  It may or may not be a coincidence, but the two greatest films to celebrate the indomitable human spirit are both products of the mid-nineties:  [[ASIN:B00005V9IJ Cast Away]] and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  Both are must-haves for serious movie buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoningare must-haves for serious movie buffs.  --D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0439023491|5.0|MILD SPOILER WARNING - This review contains mild spoilers.  I don't think that they will detract from anyone's enjoyment of the story, but you have been warned...<br /><br />I picked up \\"Catching Fire\\" almost immediately after I finished \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I couldn't wait to find out what's the next chapter in Katniss and Peta's journey, and what comes in this book did not disappoint.  I am just so glad that I get to read the books back-to-back.  Having to wait for months or years between books would probably having driven me insane...<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" picks up where \\"The Hunger Games\\" left off, with Katniss and Peeta living in the Victor's Village in District 12 and preparing for their Victory Tour through the districts.  Since the game, Katniss and Peeta's relationship has become somewhat strained, since he is genuinely in love with her and she was only putting on a show for the audience during the games to keep them alive.  To make matters worse, President Snow, the cruel and sadistic leader of the nation of Panem, is none too happy with the way Katniss got both Peeta and herself out of the hunger game alive, and is out to get her.  It turns out that unrest has been brewing throughout the districts, and Katniss's one desperate act of defiance that got both her and Peeta out of the game alive has made her a symbol of the rebellion.  In order to destroy her and squelch the rebellion once for all, President Snow announces on live television that for the next Hunger Game, the contestants or \\"tributes\\" will be selected among the past victors.  Since Katniss is the only girl who has ever won in District 12, and Peeta one of the two guy who has won, it wasn't long before the two found themselves back in the arena, fighting for their lives again. One has to wonder, how will Katniss get them both out of the game alive this time?<br /><br />I imagine that the second book in a trilogy much be the hardest to write, since the premise has already been set up and the characters introduced. So how can you make things new and interesting without giving up the essence of the book? Suzanne Collins, for one, managed this feat brilliantly.  Just like its predecessor, \\"Catching Fire\\" chronicles Katniss and Peeta's preparations for the game and the game itself.  What's different about this book, and made it even better than the first book, is the introduction of a wonderful cast of secondary characters in the other past victors who are forced to vie with Katniss and Peeta for that one final survivor's spot in the game.  With stakes being as high as they are, these secondary characters could have easily become hateful, one-dimensional villains.  But through the author's wonderful skill, a complex relationship was built between Katniss, Peeta, and many of these characters that the story became all the richer for it as the theme of loyalty and self-sacrifice both come into play in that final showdown between good and evil.  The game itself is shorter in this book than in the first one, but this time, Katniss and Peeta aren't alone as an alliance is formed between them and a couple of other past victors; and guessing how the author is going to get them all out of the mess is what kept me turning pages well into the night.  I never doubted that the author would find a way to do it, I just didn't know how.<br /><br />In \\"Catching Fire\\", the author managed the incredible feat of retaining all the elements that made the 1st book such a huge success.  There was adventure, and there was romance.  There was also the ever-present theme of rebellion that is only hinted at throughout the book but will be more fully explored in the third book.

B004FOA84A|1.0|I was really looking forward to playing this game, but every time I try to open it, it forces close. I'm using it on a Motorola Atrix.
0439023513|3.0|Hum...this is a tough one.  Whatever I had expected from this third and final book in the trilogy, it definitely wasn't this...    At the end of \\"Catching Fire\\", Katniss and 2 of the other contestants have been broken out of the arena by the rebels.  When Katniss finally wakes up from a drug induced stupor, it was to find that Peeta has been captured by the Capitol, and that District 12 has been turned into a pile of smoldering ash by President Snow's fire bombs.  Katniss, her childhood friend Gale, and her mother and sister all end up living in District 13, a district that serves as the base of the rebels and a district whose existence President Snow has taken great pains to conceal.  Life in District 13 is not easy, as your every movement is planned out through a rigidly set schedule and every scrap of food you eat is rationed.  To top it all off, the rebel leaders are determined to make Katniss the symbol of their cause without giving her any real power, while far away in the Capitol Peeta is being tortured for his associations with her.  What is Katniss to do, and does she have what it takes to become The Mockingjay, the symbol of rebellion that the rebel leaders want her to be?      If you start this third book in the trilogy expecting more of the same, you are in for a big surprise.  Gone are the hunger games, and gone are the moments of triumph that brought some much-needed lightness to its two predecessors.  Instead, this book is grim and bleak - each word, each passage mired in such hopelessness that you just know it's not going to get better..that it can't get any better without the author compromising the integrity of the book.  With President Snow torturing Peeta in the Capitol in an attempt to break her, Katniss has become a brittle husk of her former self - jumping at shadows, going through her days in drug-induced stupor as she tries to forget what has happened to Peeta, to her friends back at District 12.  As a matter of fact, despite her best efforts, throughout most of the book she is merely a pawn in the hands of the rebels as they wrest for control of the districts, just like she was President Snow's pawn in the hunger games.  She did come up for air a couple of times during the book, as rage at what the Capitol is doing to Peeta and the determination not to let President Snow win give her some needed incentive to stand up and help the rebels succeed, but those moments of brilliance are often short lived.  Often, just when it looks like she's about to triumph and rise above herself, something tragic would occur to turn her back into this hollow shell for whom even going through the motion of living is a chore.  And then there's Peeta, a formerly loving and gentle character rendered unrecognizable by his torture at the hands of President Snow. We do get to see a lot of Gale in this book, but what we get to see if often not flattering, as Gale's hatred of the Capitol often paints him as a guy who would be willing to do anything to crush the Capitol regardless of the loss of human lives.      Intellectually, I can understand why the author chose to go down this route, and that maybe, she had to go down this route.  After all, it was clear even from the beginning that this trilogy is more than just an adventure story, that it is about the lasting effects of war and the myriad of questions they raise.  Another side of me, however, still cannot help but wish for a happier ending for the characters that we have come to care about.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Like many others, I was excited to get this one for free!  Looked like a great game, but would force close every time I tried it.  Too bad.  LG Optimus S
0439023521|5.0|I don't remember when is the last time I actually picked up a book marketed as a young adult book, so I had a lot of reservations about reading this one.  I ended up being very glad that I started this on Saturday night because I could barely put it down!  I finished it within 24 hours and the only reason it took me that long is because I had to meet some friends for dinner on Sunday.  I almost did not go because I was so loath to put the book down.<br /><br />Some time in the future, the North American region has been divided into 12 districts, with all districts being ruled by a central government housed in a city simply named The Capitol.  Life is hard in the districts, with people starving and having access to the bare minimum of technology that we have now.  But the lack of material comfort is nothing compared to what the residents of the each district go through each each during the annual Hunger Games, a gladiator type of reality show that pits their children against each other.  Because, you see, once upon a time, about 80 years ago, the districts banded together to try to overthrow the Capitol.  Since then, as punishment and a reminder to the districts that the Capitol holds their lives in its hands, each year, each district is required to send 2 of their children between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Game, where the 24 contestants will be dropped into an over-sized arena and fight each other to the death until there is only 1 left standing.  The 1 left standing at the end can then go home to his or her district with all the favor and money the Capitol will see fit to bestow upon him or her.<br /><br />Sounds brutal?  It definitely is.  But for a book in which the majority of the pages are devoted to describing a games where teenagers do their best to kill each other, the author manages the incredible feat of not making the violence over-the-top or gratuitous.  What happens in that arena -  as these kids battle the elements and each other to stay alive - is interesting enough to keep the readers turning the pages.  But there is also a message here - that it is possible to retain one's humanity and common decency under the most trying of circumstances.  This is demonstrated by not only Katniss and Peeta, our 2 protagonists and the contestants from District 12, but some of the minor characters as well.  It is these glimmers of common decency that we get to witness during the in some of these characters that provide the proceedings with some much needed lightness of moments of triumph. Otherwise, the Hunger Games would have been too grim and bleak for the common reader to bear.<br /><br />In Katniss and Peeta, the author has created 2 memorable characters that are the perfect foil for each other.  Katniss, a 16-year-old coal miner's daughter who lost her father at the age of 11 and who has been the sole provider of her family since then, is definitely the more practical and calculating of the duo.  Having volunteered to join the game after her 12-year-old sister's name was called during the drawing in which the contestant's names were announced, her entire focus was on trying to survive the game so she can go back to her family.  Peeta, on the other hand, having been raised as one of the more privileged children in District 12, is more idealistic.  While survival is important to him as well, his refusal to let the Capital turn him into a monster killing machines makes him a more likable character than Katniss and the person that keeps Katniss grounded during the game.  Watching Katniss and Peeta form a tentative alliance in the man-made jungle, and seeing Katniss go from being distrustful of Peeta's every move to being willing to risk her life for him is one of the more satisfying aspects of the book.  And with all the character building and the world building that is going on, the author still manages to put in a jab at the reality-TV culture, where so-called \\"celebrities\\" are made overnight and judged not on their merits or talents but on how well they are able to manufacture a \\"personality\\" for themselves in front of the cameras.  It takes some major talent to be able to create a cast of  memorable characters, a fast-paced and interesting storyline, and so much food-for-thought within the confines of a 288 page novel.<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that will stay with you even hours after you have closed the pages.  And I highly recommend it for anyone who craves adventure along with a dose of romance in their books.  Just make sure that you have lots of time on your hand before you sit down to read it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Hate to give a one star review but it doesnt start force closes on Samsung Galaxy S    maybe developer will fix, maybe not, waste of bandwidth to download...
B004FOA84A|5.0|Takes me back to the good old point and click days of yore. There are very few games today that can get it right, much less on the mobile platforms today that can take full advantage of it. Gorgeous graphics and an adorable storyline, hard to beat this type of nostalgia. Galaxy S Vibrant
B004FOA84A|4.0|A fun game, I just wish it was longer! I beat the whole game in one lazy afternoon. A sequel would be great... reminded me of Maniac Mansion!
0316056863|3.0|I'll go with the pack and say that I love Tina Fey, her dry as a bone humor, 30-Rock, SNL and all the rest; this book was funny enough but lacking. First of all, I do agree with her father that cover is disturbing.  Second, it was short enough to be a long article. Finally, a disproportionate amount of the book was spent on the Sarah Palin act, and I found myself bored with it. Overall the book felt a bit contrived, impersonal, and a little too \\"smarty-pants\\" to be considered a memoir. I recommend waiting for the paperback (which most likely will be the size of a pamphlet).
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This is a great, must see, movie. It arrived in a short amount of time and in great shape. Thank you.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes every time on Samsung Captivate.  Doesn't work! If you have one of the phones this works on, maybe you'll be ok.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Enjoyable for about five minutes and then it's over long before it should be.  Somewhat disappointing. It would be better if it would last a little longer. Great graphics and storyline though.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I always liked this type of adventure game played on a PC.  This is the first similar game I've tried on an Android device (Droid 2).  Considering the screen size and memory limitations the developer has to work with, I consider this very well done.  If you don't enjoy this type of puzzle/hunt adventure game, this isn't for you...but if you do like this type of game, give it a try... you will be pleased.    People who are so critical of these apps, consider what you're getting for free or a dollar or two... what do you expect?  These apps are bargains for the entertainment they provide.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I love these kinds of games. Unlocking more and more of the mystery as you go along. The only problem is i beat it in about an hour. It's worth a buck.
0385474547|4.0|Whilst I had read many reviews about this book, I did not expect to love it, as I bought it to read for a thesis on African literature for school. I was very suprised then, when I not only devoured the book in a couple of hours, but thoroughly enjoyed reading it. A candid and realistic view on the period of colonialism in Africa, Achebe writes with style and simplicity, which is evidently European influenced, but very much African at its core. Unlike many other African authors of the time, Achebe does not attempt to reify the African past, but accepts that both Africans and White people alike have faults, in a poignant reflection on not only colonial rule, but humanity itself. Beautifully written, this book takes you into the heart of the Igbo society, and more importantly makes you feel; not as a European or an African, but as a human being. You will celebrate and mourn as the Igbo society falls apart, and the stunning conclusion will not only devastate you, but leave you questioning. Beginning with a quote from one of the greatest poets of our time, Yeats, Things Fall Apart is set to challenge your views from the outset, and it does just that, being, not only a beautiful piece of anticolonial writing, but also, a modern literary masterpiece.  I have and would recommend it to anyone, for an enjoyable, but thought-provoking read.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I have every Foo Fighters album.  This is the best one!  My previous favourite was The Colour and The Shape, which really rocked and had great lyrics.  This album rocks even more!  And the lyrics are excellent and delivered with passion. The Foos have really pieced it all together and focused on what they do best.  No filler tracks in this.  Just one awesome track after another. Excellent album!    I can't help thinking that getting Pat Smear back in the lineup has assisted and augmented Dave's creativity.  Both The Colour and The Shape and Wasting Light feature Pat and these are their best two album's in my opinion.  I hope Pat remains with them from here on in.      It was great to hear Krist Novoselic's bass guitar booming once more,(Krist, forget academia. Its over-rated. Keep ROCKING!)     My favourite track is Rope.    Wasting Light is unbelievably great!  Get it!

The recipes are laid out in an easy-to-read format and there are PLENTY of pictures showing the methods! I can't wait to get to baking!!!
0316056863|2.0|I brought the book because I read Tina Fey was going to do a signing after a stage performance with Steve Martin and since both are very funny I wanted to go. The problem was I read the book before I brought the tickets.     I was so disappointed, I didn't want to spend more money to get it autographed. Simply put, it's not funny, I'm confused by all the positive reviews here - but read the preview and see if you laugh once. If you do great, ignore my opinion but trust me on one thing, the rest of the book is not funnier. And there is not a single essay - the book is made up of disjointed essays - that is memorable enough to want to retell to anyone.    I finished the book in two nights, not because it was so interesting I couldn't put it down, but because it was so easy to read. It's not boring, but would expect if say, Larry King wrote about his life and show (perhaps he has, I have no interest in him) it wouldn't be boring either. It's just that a comedian's book should be funny.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Sucker Punch is a grand slam, 5-star, diamond studded allegorical tale of the triumph of the human spirit over the dark forces of misogyny, malevolence and grindingly wicked evil. Come-on, we've all encountered these \\"gutter rat characters,\\" in real life, albeit for most of us in lesser form. Don't you want to see the pimp, schoolyard bully, morally corrupt politician, obnoxiously controlling boss, or rapaciously greedy Wall Street Financier get obliterated? Sure you do! These and other societal miscreants imprison, manipulate and control for their own selfish purposes. And, I'm sure you can conjure up other communal deviants; they are all represented in this movie by the step-father and certain staff members at the insane asylum who are then cast in the metaphoric form of the zombie storm troopers, orcs and mindless robots in Babydoll's dreams where she and her companions destroy them: Domina  Victoria!  And here Babydoll, empowered by her dreams (remember, dreams are all that she has - she's locked up in an insane asylum awaiting a lobotomy) finds her true inner strength and saves herself and her other companions,  if only in self- redemption, while Sweat Pea is literally saved. Good triumphs over evil while Love triumphs over lechery, avarice and the objectification of the powerless female, or any human being enslaved by undeserved, ill-fated circumstances. In this movie, the innocent victims empower themselves and ultimately triumph -- a noble theme in a mostly ignoble world today. It is truly inspiring, especially if you've ever been figuratively \\"sucker-punched\\". Assuming we all have (been sucker-punched) this movie becomes universally relevant. And, the music fits like a cashmere glove on this unfolding allegorical tale as it completely envelopes and immerses  you into the story. Haven't you ever fallen into a metaphorical rabbit hole ... like Alice in Wonderland or, as in the movie, Babydoll entering the insane asylum? Been in a place where all is not apparent and much is hidden?  Been the victim of, for example, a destructive and manipulating malignant narcissist?  Well, in this movie they are all destroyed. Vaporized! Finally, simpler, better lines could not have been written for a movie ... they are captivating, especially those at the end and also from the character played by Scott Glenn. The director skillfully unfolds this well written and produced allegorical masterpiece through the rhetorical device of metaphor and in doing so achieves a work of Genius!   Go \\"through the looking glass\\" again. See it a 2nd time with some intellectual flare, fired-up imagination and eyes wide open.

B004K4IZ3G|3.0|I am one of the few die hard Tron fans who apparently enjoyed Legacy in the theater.  I have seen the original probably 100 times since the 80's.  Heck the video store ended up giving me the VHS one day saying that I must have purchased it several times over we rented it so much.      I expected nothing from Legacy and was surprised.  I caught it in IMAX 3-D and while I could care less for 3D films I loved the IMAX.  The original film wowed audiences with a style and sound never heard before.  Well, Legacy managed the same effect.  The style was amazing and Daft Punk's score is brilliant.  The IMAX experience was over the top and more than made up for the atrocious plot.     Sadly, the film doesn't live up to the hype on marginal home theater systems.  Don't get me wrong it;s good.  I have a 42 inch 1080p HDTV with a meager surround sound system.  The film looks beautiful but it lacks that real in your face wow factor.  Because of that I found myself really focusing on the plot more.    The original was no Oscar worthy story to be fair.  It was pretty ludicrous but Legacy really went further with some of the ridiculous elements as well as just some gaping holes.  This is Disney after all and they generally aren't known for tight stories, just stunning animation.  The biggest problem in the film I think is that the director is a professional architect.  What happens is the guy spent so much time focusing on set design that the world of Tron ends up being the principle character.  The actual actors are nothing but a vehicle to move you around from one impressive set piece to another.  Successful directors tend not to let their production elements dominate the story.     Acting wise the film is ok I suppose.  Jeff Bridges is a great actor but I suspect that the CGI for his CLU character distracts you from his performance and his Kevin character is a bit too much Big Lebowski meets Obi Wan Konobi this time around.  (Granted the plot is a heavily borrowing from Star Wars)  The two youngsters in the film were passable largely because their roles were more physical than emotional.  Basically if they could move they were pushing the film.  I garner that both will gain sex symbol status from their respective fan clubs but to the older crowds they are pretty forgettable.      One major gripe I tend to have is that there was very little attempts by the Director/writers to incorporate Tron/Rinzler in to the story more.  Frankly we rarely see Tron and even when he is on screen you don't even realize it.  Kind of silly.    Overall I think Tron Legacy was a major visual and auditory success which will forever be plagued by a lousy story.  It's a fun mindless film to throw on once in a while but much of its appeal will be lost from it's translation from the theater to your TV.  Had the director not been so set oriented maybe he could have tightened up the script but alas, it's Disney...  Traditionalists will despise this, casual or new fans will find it enjoyable.  I suspect the films soundtrack will outlive the popularity of the film.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It had problems force closing, but I turned off and on my phone and that worked. It was fun just way too short! I beat it in less than a day in my little bit of down time at work. HTC Evo.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I didn't realize from the description that this would turn into a kind of irritating master of each race love story. Too much down time, sitting around eating or bathing or being tired. The end was clearly written so that book two could start but I found it disappointing. I did like the beginning..and I do like some of the characters, the aunts are great, as is MIL vampire...
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Although I love almost all the major hits Fleetwood Mac has released, there are four that I absolutely had to have on the same album.  I looked at their other Greatest Hits and live albums but none had all the songs I wanted.  This was the only collections that had pretty much everything I love about Fleetwood Mac.

B004MKM8L8|4.0|Quality: I watched the Blu Ray on a 52\\" KDL-52Z5100 Sony LCD using my PS3 slim (latest update and connected to the Internet). The picture quality was near flawless, even when zoomed in. No artifacts in the bright white scenes (like when Ron gets slpinched) nor in the dark black scenes. I saw some very minor ones in only one scene.     Player: I like that this Blu Ray does not use Java. So, when I turn off/on my player, the movie picks back up wherever I left off without having to do a bookmark and go through the FBI warnings and crap (like you do for Half-Blood Prince).     Extras: So disappointing. There's only deleted scenes and a behind the music.

0393338827|5.0|The book was very well-written and detailed.<br /><br />It explained concisely for both laymen and professionals what the insider trading market was about and how Wall Street took down the nation's real estate market in one single blow - mainly the homes belonging to middle and low-income people. It also discusses at length the way America's middle class was sucker punched out of all of its current and future wealth and opportunities. It appears that what they didn't take into consideration is that the poor of this nation are always intricately attached to the middle class, who are living only \\"one paycheck off welfare\\" themselves. The middle classes come from those that they had no care for, and those who got hurt the most were the hard workers who ended up taking care of their stiffed relatives.<br /><br />Great read! I haven't read Liar's Poker yet, and after this one, I don't really think I need to. What else is there to say? I get it.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|First - the sound of the record is warm and amazing. This is the best record sonically that Foo Fighters have ever put out. Recording to tape gave it a fat, warm, solid feel and the mix is the best mix they've had since The Colour and the Shape. Second - Speaking of TCATS, Wasting Light is the best record they've put out since TCATS all those years ago. It's just a cohesive, solid, spectacular rock offering and I am in love with the record.    I can't get enough of it and the guys deserve this to go multi-platinum.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Once in our lifetime we have a singer who comes along who can sing the emotions we have buried deep inside.  We turn up the song and suddenly we're laughing, and crying all the same time because we can finally express those feelings that express our humanity in all its naked glory.<br /><br />Adele is the kind of singer who, through grappling her way through her own pain and despair, sings it out loud and clear for us all to join in, almost relishing the worst pain of our lives, because getting it out feels so good.  Adele carries us along on that great, big, beautiful voice of hers, that aches with emotion, and soars to the heavens allowing us a glimpse of what it feels to be totally in the moment of a great passion.  Adele doesn't need any whistles and bells, no voice enhancement, no dancing and pyrotechnics to distract us from what's really important about music, and what music can do for us, which is that it allows us to feel.<br /><br />The fact that Adele writes her own songs, I find astounding. I can't name one other singer's singer, who also writes songs any singer would give up their first-born to be allowed to sing.  Sure we have great writers, Dylan, the Beatles, Lenoard Cohen, Neil Young and songwriting teams from the past that have written classic songs for great singers like Streisand, Celine, and dozens of others, but to have both of these gifts in one package is mind-boggling.<br /><br />Adele's great ballad(Someone Like You) dedicated to a guy who dumped her, probably saying he wasn't ready for get serious, and then finding out he's now married, speaks to all of us.  Who doesn't have someone who taught us that a heart can truly feel like it's breaking?  Who hasn't wanted to yell at that person, warning them 'don't underestimate the things that I will do'?<br /><br />I had previously warn out Adele's first album (19) and was anxiously awaiting her second, but as much as I enjoyed her first album, I couldn't have imagined that she'd outdo herself so thoroughly.  I can only imagine what her ex-lover put her through to inspire her to write such heartbreakingly beautiful songs.  I don't know whether to thank him, or hit him for putting her through all that pain.<br /><br />This album is already in my top-ten favorites of all time.  True genius in both writing and vocal ability.horoughly.  I can only imagine what her ex-lover put her through to inspire her to write such heartbreakingly beautiful songs.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|It's not quite four months into the year, but this is probably the best album that's going to be released in 2011.<br /><br />Is Wasting Light the best Foo Fighters album yet? It's all a matter of opinion, of course, but unlike previous albums you won't find yourself skipping a song or two along the way. The first two songs, \\"Bridge Burning\\" and \\"Rope\\", set the tone for the rest of the album: hard rock with deep (or catchy) lyrics, except \\"White Limo\\", whose lyrics make no sense, not that one can understand them. It's the hardest song on the album and it rocks. Any of the first four songs are better than virtually anything one will find on the radio.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the next four songs, but they're just not as special as the rest. Let's call them very good, but not great. The album closes with \\"Miss the Misery\\", \\"I Should Have Known\\" (an instant classic), and \\"Walk\\". The pacing of the tracks is perfect, and because one isn't going to find an acoustic ballad on this album, the flow is perfect as well.<br /><br />In 20 years, when we're arguing with our friends about the best albums ever, this will be on the tip of my tongue. If you are a fan of the Foo Fighters, get this album. None of the tracks disappoint.
B004PGO25O|3.0|I have been a fan of Steven Pressfield ever since I read \\"Gates of Fire\\". I was excited when I heard he was doing a book for the Domino Project, and you can't beat the price tag on the Kindle edition.<br /><br />The instructional content in \\"Do the Work\\" definitely deserves five stars. It is motivational in the extreme, especially for writers or aspiring writers. I found myself itching to finish the book and get started on a monumental new project of my own. Mr. Pressfield's sense of humor shines through and makes the book very enjoyable to read, save for one glaring flaw.<br /><br />For some reason, Mr. Pressfield felt that it was necessary to include a liberal sprinkling of profanity throughout \\"Do the Work\\". I realize that profanity has it's place in lending realism to works of fiction, history, etc., but why is it necessary in a non-fiction work that is meant to inspire and elevate readers? The authors featured in the Domino Project seem very eager that their works be read and shared, but my many of my friends and family would be offended by the coarse language in \\"Do the Work\\", and I would feel ashamed to recommend it to them for that reason. I hope that future authors of Domino Project pieces will exclude the profanity.

0307454541|3.0|With over two thousand reviews and counting, this single review is probably going to be lost in the mass, but hey - everyone's a critic, right? Like almost everyone else, I became aware of the Millennium trilogy due to the overwhelming amount of hype surrounding both the books and the films. Though I'm a little late to the party (the first English translation was published in 2008), the band-wagon doesn't seem to have died down just yet, especially with news of a Hollywood adaptation in the works.<br /><br />Though Stieg Larsson sadly passed away before the publication of his novels, the popularity of them in the wake of his death has shone further light on his political convictions, most of which are also present as themes within \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" The original Swedish title of the book is \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" and the author is quite merciless in tearing apart the preconceptions of Sweden as an enlightened, liberal country and exposing a more corrupt, violent underbelly.<br /><br />The premise is sufficiently intriguing. After losing a libel case against a millionaire industrialist, journalist Mikael Blomkvist is contacted by the wealthy magnate Henrik Vanger who offers him a tempting proposition: in return for inside information that will expose Hans-Erik Wennerstrom for the corporate fraud he is, Vanger wants Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece Harriet Vanger. The catch? Harriet disappeared over two decades ago, and Vanger is certain that because of the circumstances of her disappearance, it was a family member who murdered her.<br /><br />Since then, every year on his birthday, Vanger has received a pressed and framed flower. He's convinced that it is a taunt from Harriet's killer, and despite her disappearance being dismissed as a cold case, he's determined that there be one last attempt at solving the mystery before he dies. Hired for one year of work and working under the cover of writing a Vanger family biography, Mikael agrees to the contract.<br /><br />But he'll need help. Enter Lisbeth Salander, the namesake of the title: an introverted, anti-social twenty-four year old computer hacker, covered in tattoos and piercings, and a phenomenal researcher who is able to dig up all kinds of obscure information on whomever her employer requests. That quote in my title is from her lips. It was her skills that Vanger employed in order to judge Mikael worthy of hiring, and she finds herself drawn into the disappearance of Harriet just as surely as Mikael is. With a dark past that will surely be explored in later novels, Lisbeth is easily the most compelling part of \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" described by the author himself as a \\"grown-up Pippi Longstocking\\" and with a slightly skewered but strict moral code: that everyone is responsible for their actions, and that the guilty must be punished for their indiscretions.<br /><br />It is the odd friendship forged between Mikael and Lisbeth that makes up the emotional center of the novel, as the two slowly learn to trust each other, depend on each other's skills, and finally bring the truth to light in a fairly harrowing climax. It's an engaging basis for a story, and is enough to hook any reader into completing the entirety of the novel, but often its execution is somewhat flawed.<br /><br />Although the disappearance of Harriet is the crux of the novel, there is a vast array of other plots and storylines that make up the bulk of the book - swathes of exposition on rather irrelevant issues, complex backstories for people who are tangential to the plot, and some rather questionable decisions in pacing and characterization.<br /><br />The biggest mistake is probably the fact that after the mystery of Harriet is solved, the book continues on at length in regards to the score Mikael has to settle with Wennerstrom, the latter being a character we never meet and who encompasses a storyline that has no real emotional weight to it, especiallyafter the watershed of the Harriet-plot. It's like two books have been squished into one. In this respect, there's simply too much going on in a novel that contains a lot of excess padding (I could have happily done without the insight into Mikael's love life considering that practically every woman who crosses his path wants to sleep with him, and none of it adds anything to the plot).<br /><br />There are other little niggles. Mikael uncovers a clue in a photograph that I refuse to believe the diligent police-investigator didn't pick up for himself, and I saw the twist concerning the numbers that Harriet had written in her notebook coming a mile away (if movies have taught me anything, it's that if faced with a series of obscure numbers, one should simply reach for the Bible). Finally, the ultimate fate of the killer is immensely unsatisfying. To avoid spoilers I'll just leave it at that, but readers will know what I mean.<br /><br />As a side-note, many of the book's detractors point to the sexual violence of the novel as excessive and sadistic. Well, I am a very queasy person when it comes to this subject (I flat out cannot watch the depiction of rape on television), but I was not particularly disturbed by what I read here. Naturally everyone has a different threshold of tolerance when it comes to this sort of thing, but for what it's worth, I found it relatively easy to stomach. There is nothing gratuitous or titillating about Larsson's treatment of the subject; in fact, I was interested to discover that this aspect of the novel was inspired by the fact that Larsson was once witness to the gang-rape of a young woman, leaving him with continual feelings of guilt that he did not/was unable to help her.<br /><br />It seems inevitable then that a character like Lisbeth Salander would be born out of this experience, and Larsson even goes so far as to name her after the original rape victim. Unfortunately, this leads to another trip-up, probably the most glaring of the entire novel. It will come as no surprise to the reader to learn that Lisbeth is raped (by her legal guardian appointed by the state, no less) but Larsson completely glosses over the emotional trauma sustained by rape victims to a rather jaw-dropping degree. Lisbeth is completely calm and self-assured as she meticulously plots her retribution, making the whole thing little more than a revenge-fantasy. Larsson appears to try and cover for this towards the end of the novel by insinuating that Lisbeth has Asperger's syndrome, but since this is also brought up only to be ignored, it becomes just as irrelevant as the rape itself.<br /><br />With that in mind, the central theme of the novel is almost ludicrously simplistic: rapists, religious fanaticism and Nazis are bad. Perhaps the reason I wasn't so bothered by the rape/violence was because it caters to a message that is hardly shocking or profound.<br /><br />Of course, it's easier to point out the flaws of a novel than the strengths, and ultimately - this *is* a strong novel. I found Lisbeth to be a fascinating character, and the hunt for Harriet's killer kept me committed to seeing it through to the end. I'm not in a huge hurry to get to the sequel, but I will definitely get there eventually.

1416955070|5.0|Overview:<br />City of Bones is the first book in The Mortal Instruments series, and it is set in modern day New York--only a little different. Little do we mundanes(regular human beings) know but all around us is a supernatural world where all legends are true in part. Clary Fray found this out the hard way. In one night Clary and her friend, Simon, go from being regular everyday teenagers at a New York club to teens thrust into the world of werewolves, demons, faeries, vampires, and Shadowhunters.<br /><br />The book follows Clary's introduction to the Shadow World through her journey to find her mom who has been kidnapped. Along the way, she discovers that things aren't how she has always supposed them to be. She discovers unexpected secrets, makes new friends as well as new enemies, and has to face the biggest challenges of her life. Will she survive it? Only time will tell.<br /><br />My Opinion:<br />City of Bones is an extrememly well written fantasy with detailed and rich characters. The book leaves you begging for a sequel and thankfully there are currently three more books in the series to satisfy those cravings. It is fast paced and has a detailed and twisted storyline/plot. Just when you think that you have it all figured out you get thrown another curve ball. I recommend this book to readers 5th grade and above although it has just as strong of an appeal with adults. If you love Harry Potter, you will love City of Bones and the rest of The Mortal Instruments Series.

B004FOA84A|1.0|This app failed before it was even started.  It was forced stopped.  Don't waste your time or your money.  I downloaded this free  app of the day and still feel like i was over charged.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is entertaining for an hour or so. It hooks you in but then it leaves you wanting more. needs more story and perhaps a cg cutscene. overall: good effort, could've been great.
B000O59A2K|5.0|I really like both these movies by the Duke. \\"El Dorado\\" is another of his westerns where he is a gunfighter that works for the good guys. \\"El Dorado\\" has a lot of time spans between several of the scenes which lets the viewer know 6 months or so has passed since last scene. There are actors who are a lot of the old guys that have the usual small parts, like Johnny Crawford of \\"Rifleman\\" fame who Wayne \\"accidentally\\" shoots, Bruce Cabot, a long time co-star, Paul Fix also of \\"Rifleman\\" fame, Charlene Holt - Wayne's hottie girlfriend, Arthur Hunnicut, James Caan (co-star) - we know where he has been since 1966, and Michelle Carey - one of Elvis's love interests at one time, and Ed Asner (co-star) is the bad guy, along with Christopher George - of \\"The Rat Patrol\\" fame.<br />In this movie Robert Mitchum is the Sheriff that John Wayne describes as \\"a star with at drunk pinned to it\\" for a very good reason. You know the plot, the sheriff gets the hots for some wandering petticoat and she drops him like the proverbial hot potatoe and he crawls inside the bottle for consolation.<br />Needless to say, Duke succeeds in helping Mitchum \\"dry out\\" and get his head back together while fighting the hired guns who give the town a lot of trouble, not to say the McDonald family.<br />I always enjoy the westerns of John Wayne and this one is no exception. I really like the musical score, scored and conducted by Nelson Riddle, with its recurring theme and the \\"oh crap\\" music when something unexpected happens, like when Michelle Carey's character ambushes the Duke after shooting her little brother, Johnny Crawford. I think all who like the Duke's movies really like this one.

0316056863|2.0|I didn't dislike it but it was a surprisingly quick read. Not a ton of \\"substance\\" and basically affirms what I've always thought of Tina Fey: she is a rapid fire joke teller who almost tries too hard all the time to make people laugh/like her. I get the impression that in real life she would be totally overwhelming to hang out with - which is to say that she's probably a lot like me. Which isn't a terrible thing but makes for a less interesting book.     I admire that she is a businesswoman and to that extent takes a lot into consideration (should she have another baby when doing so jeopardizes hundreds of peoples' jobs?) outside if her personal wants, even when that means crying in a bathroom stall at work. And that she gives credit where it's due (Lorne Michaels) but her \\"story\\" isn't anything particularly interesting since a great deal of it was innate talent and being in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately this is a weak spot of publishing: take any \\"it\\" person of the moment and get them to write a memoir, regardless of whether their story could best be summed up in an essay or 5 minute video clip. This isn't Tina Fey's fault, of course, but the filler material for the rest of the book felt a little uneven and tried too hard to win you over with comedy. To me it felt pushy and unnatural. I would have preferred a shorter book with more stories of who she is and fewer silly lists (filler material).
B0000028UK|4.0|Many people may have forgotten about the fact that by the time of October 1993 Pearl Jam had become the most popular band of the alternative rock genre, bigger than Nirvana. I was one of the nearly 1 million buyers of \\"Vs.\\" beneath the first week of its release which earned the band a Guinness book entry as \\"fastest selling record in rock's history\\". Certainly this was more a result of the band's rapidly increased popularity since 1991 than a proof of the new album's quality. \\"Vs.\\" still contained many good songs but in contrast to \\"Ten\\" it had an edgier sound and was lacking of smash hits like \\"Alive\\" or \\"Jeremy\\". Two aspects which in those days for a grunge band were important proofs of realness, credibility and not-selling-out. But I always felt that the raw production quality and the absence of some epic hit singles withheld \\"Vs.\\" from being a real outstanding album. Unfortunately the band also refused to make videos for MTV to promote the album in the following months so that \\"Vs.\\" never really achieved the status of its predecessor \\"Ten\\". When Kurt Cobain committed suicide in April 1994, a new Nirvana hype began and many people forgot what a disappointing album \\"In Utero\\" was and that the band was slowly going downhill in popularity. Instead of 1994 becoming Pearl Jam's great year at the top, MTV constantly played Nirvanas \\"Unplugged In New York\\" and Soundgarden's \\"Black Hole Sun\\", which now made Soundgarden to be the #1 existing rock band. By the end of that year Pearl Jam released \\"Vitalogy\\" but most of the hype and public interest about the band was gone and couldn't be revived, since the band still tried to escape from all the MTV and media thing. From that point of time onwards they slowly faded away into oblivion album by album and year by year. They could have spent a long time career at the top instead of wasting everything. Now Pearl Jam is considered as just another grunge band beind Nirvana...nothing more. Sad.
B001UJUGZY|3.0|'Possession' was really diappointing because the movie is too short. They could have done so much with this to really keep you on the edge of your seat, keep you guessing, and could've made many twists and turns. It doesn't and it fails and falls short of what it could have been.      The movie itself is about 2 brothers.. 1 good, 1 bad. The good one is Gellar's husband. One night there's a car accident and ironically, the accident is between the 2 brothers. They're both in the hospital, both in a coma. One comes out of the coma.. yes u guessed it, the bad one. However, he talks, acts and remembers things that only her husband would know. Is the brother actually her husband? Did their souls switch bodies? Or is it something more? That's the basic plot.       Sounds good enough, but the problem is that the movie is so short that they cram all the answers in there way too quickly, leaving no time to try and fit puzzle pieces together or be surprised. They give everything away in a very short time. The movie itself is only a little over 80 minutes long. By the time the car accident happens and the one brother comes out of the coma.. they leave very little time left for all they could have put in there to really make this a really good suspensful movie.        A real let down.
1400052173|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  I am not a fast reader, but finished this in 2 1/2 days while doing many other things. I just can't explain the effect that it has had on me.  To be able to read about a lady who has given mankind so much and then to see how her family has suffered is haunting and illuminating.  I really, in all my naive ways, had no idea how Blacks were treated back in the 50's.  I was far too young.  It causes me shame and has a profound way of changing my way of thinking about life in general.  We all owe so very much to Henrietta Lacks and to her family who suffered immeasurably.  THIS BOOK IS A MASTERPIECE.  READ IT!!
B004FOA84A|3.0|Loved the puzzles and interaction (Droid X), and the story was good....until the very end. It was kind of a letdown. I hope there's a continuation on the story line. Or even just more apps like this one!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Tried numerous times to start, even rebooting phone and  still force closed every time. Not a  gamer,  but was looking forward to playing this type of game. Running on Droid X with all updates.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I thought Dr Who was gone twenty years ago. The last time I saw Dr Who was back in the 1980's. I loved that show with all of it's inexpensive special effects and great actors that really made the show special to me. I didn't know it's been revived until I accidently seen it here on Amazon. I'm glad it's back!    The new Dr Who series still has the same story formula as the older series but it's been modernized for the 21st century. Dr Who is still Dr Who from past series. He travels in a police box called the Tardis through time and space. There's always an adventure and there's always something strange that will keep your attention thoughout the each episode. What's really changed from the past is a love relationship with his young assitant which gives it a little twist. The love relationship starts off as small hints throughout each episode but it tells you straight out and end of the season. All the special effects and sets are not cheap looking and all the actors are top notch!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I purchased Inside Job after it was unavailable at Blockbuster.  It should be a must view for every American who wants to learn how the unethical behavior and greediness of corporate giants caused the financial disaster.  Many of these crooks are now making public policy having moved into government positions.  Is there any surprise that financial regulation has been stalemated?
B004FOA84A|1.0|I can't say that I can give much in regards to a review on this, since it Force Closes EVERY time on launch.  Motorola Atrix.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Awesome search engine for scientific, geographical, and biographical material. Not a simple google like search provider, it provides the facts in a great format from several reliable sources.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes every time on HTC Evo. Couldn't even get the app to run. Would have been really mad if I had paid for this, but since I didn't, oh well.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes on gtablet every single time I try to start it.   Waste of time.  Glad it was free. bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad  more than 25 words
B004FOA84A|3.0|Will not run on a Motorola Xoom tablet (Force close on launch).   Seems to work fine on Archos 7o tablet though.   Would rate it higher if it worked on newer devices (Xoom,  Atrix,  etc.).
B004SBX112|1.0|Paid for this app a while back but don't see an update for the easter version. Get in the game Amazon. Where if my update. So far I am very disappointed in the Amazon appstore!
B004FOA84A|1.0|First, it is a fun game. I enjoy the graphics ana gameplay. The biggest problem with it is you can not install to sd card.  I will be uninstalling shortly.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was a fun little time waster, but a few nitpicks. It's way too short for a seasoned adventure gamer, the ending being fairly terrible only makes that issue worse.  The install being so big with no apps2sd support is annoying.  Other than that it ran fine on my Evo and was definitely a good little game. I'd now probably pay to buy a similar game from this developer.
B004P6EQE6|4.0|i already have a decent vinyl mono original, but i got this anyway because of the Steve Hoffman remastering. It's GREAT.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This book does not offer any simple recipe for making checklists in a particular situation as I thought before purchasing, but it does outline the ways in which checklists vary, the reasons why they vary, and several real world examples of their implementation.  As a whole, the book is more about why we should use checklists than it is about how they should be constructed.      The book is a pretty entertaining read; there are several case studies which are narrated semi-autobiographically.  These case studies outline several extremes of checklist.  It helped me to understand what is required in a checklist and what considerations might be required in specific circumstances, so in many respects I got what I wanted from this book in the end.      I think the only thing this book was really missing was a summary of the main points of the book, something like a checklist-checklist would have been nice.  Overall, I think this is a worthwhile read for nearly anybody; when you start thinking about the topics in this book you will realize that you might be able to use checklists too.
1591843790|5.0|Yes. Yes. Yes!<br /><br />These are the words that I kept saying in my mind as I turned the pages of Guy Kawasaki's latest book, Enchantment.<br /><br />Enchantment, the tenth book from this best-selling Silicon Valley guru, is an all-in-one guidebook to personal, product and company branding. This is something I've been doing for 25 years, so I can say with authority that this book is the real deal. He encourages us all to dream big and to have a meaningful vision that inspires others. Whether that dream is personal computing (as in the case of Apple and the Macintosh) or your own desire to change the world, you need to have a worthwhile cause that can engage others.<br /><br />Guy knows a thing or two about making companies and products enchanting, having been the chief evangelist of Apple in the early days, a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur. With a large Facebook and Twitter following, he is also a poster child for personal branding in the age of social media. Two chapters are devoted to his sharing of \\"push\\" and \\"pull\\" technology in our digital world.<br /><br />What I love about this book is that it's about branding from the inside out. Before embarking on your quest for enchantment, you need to be likeable and trustworthy--basically, you need a winning personality and the right set of values. If you are thinking Dale Carnegie, you are on the right track. Guy writes about knowing who the influencers are and how to influence people--ethically and authentically. He also understands the need to enchant your employees (Chapter 10) and enchant your boss (Chapter 11). Those looking to manage change in their companies would do well to read this book.<br /><br />I did not find the personal stories contributed by others at the end of each chapter to be that inspiring or illustrative, but they don't distract from the overall excellence of this book. Another small nit is when he says his positioning statement is two words: \\"Empower people.\\" This is really his mission, not his unique value proposition, which is what positioning is all about. The important point that he makes is to be clear on what you do and to communicate it in a compelling and credible way.<br /><br />So much of what Guy says in this volume is common sense, but he has a way of making it all sound fresh. I found the book, quite simply, enchanting!on, not his unique value proposition, which is what positioning is all about. The important point that he makes is to be clear on what you do and to communicate it in a compelling and credible way.<br /><br />So much of what Guy says in this volume is common sense, but he has a way of making it all sound fresh.

B004RJZA1E|4.0|`Amaranthe' is the self titled debut album by the newcomer Swedish melodic metal band. \\"Amaranthe\\" is a multi-fronted metal outfit; essentially the group features three lead singers: female vocalist Elize Ryd, male singer Jake E. Lundberg and screamer/brutal vocalist Andreas Solvestrom. The instrumental line up features guitarist/keyboardist Olof Morck, bassist Johan Andreassen and drummer Morten Sorensen. One has to agree that `Amaranthe's band format is rather unique, although perhaps slightly over the top in the eyes of a more conservative rock/metal audience.<br /><br />In terms of song-writing `Amaranthe' is melodic metal, built on thick guitar riffs, melodic keyboards, double bass drumming, a mixture of clean and brutal vocals, inventive guitar solos and the catchiest choruses one could wish for.<br /><br />Focusing on the singers, all thee vocalists participate on each and every song, Elize is probably the most featured voice, followed by Jake who duets her and adds to the musical dialogue, while Andreas screams a couple of lines of each song while having minimal presence during the choruses (which as mentioned are very melodic and have a rather mainstream quality). If one had to pick a vocalist, I would say that Elize is the most impressive character of `Amaranthe' being easily one of the most vocally proficient female singers in metal and with each song she uncovers a bit more of her vocal ability; never forgetting to mention her physical statue (to say that she is just beautiful, is an understatement). At this point one suggest that you check their promo video \\"Hunger\\" which is nothing less than a mini-action movie, being also representative of their musical style. Favorite tracks include \\"1 million lightyears\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Enter the maze\\" and \\"Automatic\\".<br /><br />\\"Amaranthe\\" definitely emerge under an original band concept, solid song-writing and talented performers yet-as with any musical novelty-it is up to each individual listener to decide whether the approach of \\"Amaranthe\\" works for them.e\\" works for them.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie as well as the first two are amazing!  My 2 year old daughter is obsessed.  She watches them over and over again.  And, I don't mind.  I actually still find something that Disney/Pixar did that I find genius every time I watch it.  I can only imagine how much time they took brainstorming and putting this movie together.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I highly recommend this movie, both as a piece of history and for those who need to overcome a personal obstacle. The story of how HRH King George VI overcomes his stammer and fear is inspiring and this is a very well written movie that deserves the awards it has won. The cinematography is beautiful and the characters both believable and also yet somewhat larger than life. I rented it on pay-per-view and will still purchase a hard copy to add to my movie collection.
B004FOA84A|4.0|enjoyed the game very much.  puzzles were fun to solve and challengeing.  highly recommend it.  play with your friends and family for a group adventure.
0756404738|4.0|I was introduced to this author from a friend after discussing our similiar interests into fantasy literature.  After reading The Name of the Wind, I really had high hopes for the story that was to follow.  Luckily for me, WMF came out just before I finished The Name of the Wind and I rolled right into it.  If I had to rate The Name of the Wind from 1 to 10 as it goes along the whole book, I would say that it stays around an 8 for most of the book, peaks at times to 9.0/9.5 and only once dips to the 6.5/7.0 range (the Trebon section).  WMF seems a little slower in terms of story, as in my opinion floats in the 6.5/7.0 range, peaks at times to 8.0/8.5, and dips to 3.5/4.0 range more often than I would have liked.    The problem with rating this book now is that we don't know how the third book will play out and if the investment in some of the lower points of this book \\"pays off\\".  One example would be all that frankly boring scenes with Denna.  At this point, I am saying what is the purpose of all these pages we are forced to read about this girl?  I keep thinking if Kvothe is so clever, he would probably remove himself from this situation quickly, since he clearly has the aptitude to do even when under the spell of legendary fairy of fornification.  However, readers are bombarded by all these near impossible chance meetings with Denna in random town across the world.  However, are they chance meetings at all?  Is Denna something more than simply human?  Is Kvothe being tested as a result?  We don't know at this point and don't know if all those dry encounters will pay off in the end, but at this time I wish Denna was written out of the book.    Fortunately for readers, Rothfuss knows how to write an interesting story even if the parts seem a little loose.  There is enough humor both subtle and direct, that can give you a chuckle.  The writing is easy to read and easy to visualize.  I would say that this fact alone makes the book good even if the underlying story seems fragmented at this point.  In addition, I give high levels of goodwill to Kvothe from my feelings about this character from the first book.  What I mean by this is that I like the character so much after Name of the Wind, that I was able to still enjoy this book despite the story being inferior overall.  I wanted to see more of what he did.  My 4 star rating give 5 points for the writing and character and 3 stars for the story.  Overall, it is not a horrible book, but in my opinion is not as fun as the first.    Possible minor spoilers below.    My concern for the next book is how Rothfuss will pull together all the elements that have been introduced, hinted and told in the last two books.  At the end of WMF, I am not convinced that Kvothe is the butt-kicker he is hinted to be (or will he ever be?).  So, does he still become more powerful and how many pages are needed for that.  I know he saves a princess from a sleeping barrow king (from book jacket).  He apparently kills a king (series title implies that).  He still needs to be expelled (though the end of WMF does give some idea how that might occur).  What will happen with Ambrose (does he kill him, help him down the road, the princess?)?.  There is war in the current times due to Kvothe apparently, may or may not be be wrapped up.  He faked his death, the hows and why need to be explained.  Auri, how I like her.  What happens to her?  Denna (enough said there).  When does he speak to a god?  Does he kill the Chandrian? If so how? If he does not, I might be dissappointed.  He is not that powerful yet to even imply that he can.  Does he find out the mystery of the Amyr?  What happened to his Adem sword?  How and when does he meet Bast and become his master?  When does he become powerful enough to be a master?  This Bast question seems to have some history alone according to the current time accounts.  Does he meet up with Abenthy again (I sort of hope so)?  Apparently he seems very wealthy in the current times, why? (I have a guess, though saving a princess has to be luctrative.  Can't count too much on a Maer though).  How did he become so good at being an innkeeper and cooking?  He lost all of his magic and fighting mojo.  Why?  What ultimately happens to Kvothe?  He is waiting to die, why?  Why wait? He is informed in Alchemy.  There are others as well, but this is off the top of my head.  So, how will Rothfuss put all this info in the next book.  To me, that is my wise man's fear after reading both of these books so far.  Good luck with that Patrick :-)    Lastly, Patrick if you read this, don't do what George RR Martin did and leave your fans hanging for many years waiting for the last book.  He lost what was once a guaranteed sale because of that and from what I read, many more.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this was a fun game for what it is. if it is fc on you then maybe you should report it and not give it 1 star. it is a good game.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Rooted HTC Evo, I had an FC immediately after downloading, wait a couple of second and try again, it worked fine for me after that.... As for the game: Great graphics, game play was fun, difficulty was perfect. I just wish it was either longer or had more levels. I beat it in about 40 minutes. Had I payed I would be grumpy, but thanks to Amazon it was the perfect game before bed. G' Night.

B004H4XDBI|4.0|Originally posted at [...]<br /><br />I'd like to begin by first admitting that I have not read If I Stay. But, I can also say that I felt Gayle Forman did a great job making sure that wasn't necessary! I read this because I was looking forward to hearing a guys perspective on love, loss, and relationships. The concept for this book left me intrigued enough to pursue it without reading it's companion book.<br /><br />Let me say Adam's inner thoughts and sarcasm are quite entertaining! I found that even though this book was centered around something so depressing, it was still hopeful and funny at parts. I would definitely describe Where She Went as a rollercoaster! I cried and smiled and laughed my way through this book. It was great!<br /><br />Gayle Forman definitely outdid herself with this book. It was extremely authentic and believable. Now, I'm not a guy, but I definitely feel that is exactly how they think sometimes! She did a great job. I also loved that she added in lyrics from Adam's songs... You can see how they tie into the story. Music is such a HUGE part of this story and being a music junkie myself I loved every second of it.<br /><br />For the most part, the chapters alternate between the past and present.. I found this to be somewhat difficult at times. As much as I loved hearing about Adam and Mia's past, I wanted to know what was going to happen then! I would have to wait for another whole chapter before I could resume! Found myself speed reading through the chapters from the past at times. I had a love-hate relationship with this layout... I liked it because it fleshed everything out for me. This was super helpful, not having read If I Stay. At the same time, I hated getting pulled away from the present story!<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great, inspirational read. It's inspiring in the sense that you see two people who have been through so much, find peace in their lives. I definitely suggest you all check it out! You don't need to have read If I Stay because it's great as a standalone read. Enjoy!cause it's great as a standalone read. Enjoy!

B002VPE1OS|5.0|These screen protectors are comparable to the best out there. I was finally able to install one recently and the thing that makes these stand out is the fact that there is a film on both sides of the protector to keep it from being marred during installation. This is a great method of packaging. These can be installed quickly and simply. Using the installation card without worry about possibly scratching the matte screen protector itself.<br /><br />My fingers slide across with ease, reduces the glare and reduces the fingerprints.<br /><br />Overall right up there with the 'premium' brands. highly recommended.

0345529057|2.0|So I loved these books.  Read them a few times and have them in hard back.  Being a complete-ist I ordered this compiled set with the HBO tie-in covers.      Immediately I was struck by how flimsy the box was for the set.  Thin, thin, thin.  As a result of this real flimsy box (and some poor packaging choices) the shipping resulted in a several dings in the book corners as the box was no protection for them.  Additionally, the box is assembled via a folded tab system, much like putting together a shipping package.  What this means is that whatever book gets placed into the fourth position will jam its cover and pages on the tab itself.  Poor design that.  Because the books fit so snuggly into this box you would have to remove the third position book, insert the fourth and then reinsert the third to avoid this from happening.    As for the books themselves, there is a strange tightness to them which makes me fear for them holding up to reading. Let me also say that is speculation on my part being an avid reader.  Perhaps they will hold up fine.  I just wanted to mention it as it occurred to me as I was examining the set.     With all that said, the fifth book comes out in months so I would wait for the next iteration of sets which will hopefully be of better quality all around.  I would think a hardback compilation would be coming eventually (and deservedly so).    Final thought- Pass.
B004FOA84A|4.0|great concept, just too short.  this was a pretty entertaining game.  good graphics, and nice flow.  was disappointed when it ended.  I would have liked to play it for another couple of hours.

1595822003|5.0|I am devoting this review to the Bernie Wrightson edition of Frankenstein. I wrote another review of the book itself, which readers can find on amazon and lunch.com. Stephen King wrote the introduction to this edition. He points out, among other things, that readers who only saw the movie versions of this classic will be surprised how different the original is from the screen versions. He also tells us that he recognizes that many people started the book and never finished it. This is deplorable, because the book is excellent and should be read. He himself first started it when he was 13 and did not finish it. However, later when he taught a literature class, he read it again and discovered how marvelous it is, and made it part of his course.<br /><br />King tells us that Bernie Wrightson's forty-some pen and ink portrayals of the book are excellent. They are \\"filled with a clear and feverish energy.... There has never been a finer exhibition of black and white work than the one you will find here.\\" His artistic studies \\"enhanced Mary Shelly's story.\\"<br /><br />I agree. Wrightson portrays Dr. Frankenstein as a handsome man with a face expressing strength and determination, perfectly appropriate to the Shelly story. His creature is shown to be muscular, as we would expect, for Dr. Frankenstein must have given him, at least at the beginning, before he changed his mind and became disgusted at his creation, the best body possible. When he stands next to his creator, he is a quarter taller. But his face is distorted. It seems to be unfinished, as if it still needs to be smoothed out. Most significantly - and this is the marked difference between the novel and its screen depictions - Wrightson captures the being's sad and yearning look.
0316776963|3.0|After listening to everyone raving about this book for years, I finally broke down and bought myself a copy. It's entertaining but after all the reviews of everyone saying how hilarious this book is, I expected to be rolling on the floor laughing with tears in my eyes from the hilarity. For a book that starts off with 5 pages of glowing reviews of how ridiculously funny this book is, I was expecting more than an occasional snicker. There were lots of parts where you might say to yourself, \\"Oh, thats funny\\", but you don't actually laugh out loud. Not a terrible read, but not exactly what I'd call a side splitter. But, thats just me.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I bought this on a whim because, despite loving Evangelion the series, all the movies have been lackluster. I disliked the original movies and the first Rebuild was nice to look at but it was the same stuff I'd seen before. This movie is not that.    2.22 takes things in a completely new direction while keeping everything familiar. The sound design, visuals, and voicework are all top notch, except for Kensuke. After watching the end I could only think that it's going to suck having to wait a few years for the 3.33, but I'm sure it will be well worth it.
B00009L1TA|1.0|The company I bought this DVD from advertised it as being in it's orginal packaging which implied it was new.  When I received it, it turned out to be a used copy that was re-wrapped.  The quality was awful and we missed several parts.  I will not buy from this company again.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Forced close several times before opening.  Played on XOOM. Once it finally opened I didn't have any problems.  Game is fun but short. No replay value.
0525422943|5.0|I finished this book about a week ago and am just now getting around to reviewing it, but that doesn't mean I didn't love it. I'm pretty sure I even liked the sequel better than the first book.  Writing Where She Went from Adam's point of view was a great twist, because it allowed the reader to get to know Adam and how he felt about Mia, because in the first book we only know Adam through Mia's view of him, and only saw their relationship through her eyes. And believe it or not, Adam brings more depth to their characters and their relationship than even Mia did.    We get to see Adam the rockstar, though he hates that term, Adam the bad boy, though he's really not, and Adam with a new life, though he's still mourning the loss of his old one. Throughout the book we find out what exactly happened after Mia woke up, and even though she's not telling the story herself, we come to understand why she left and never came back. The whole story actually makes sense, like it would actually play out this way in real life. Mia resented Adam for making her stay, for changing after her family died, and essentially for loving her so much. Because of that, he was the only remaining part of her life that she couldn't keep.  Enter, Adam the rockstar. He turned his anger toward Mia into songs, which became an insanely successful album and turned his band into the \\"new Nirvana\\" or something along those lines (probably the most unrealistic part of the book). But he hates every minute of it, because he can't let her go. I'm sorry to give basically a plot summary of the book, but there's no other way for me to describe how perfect it is. It's the best possible conclusion to their story, and it respects every character the way they deserve. Not one character is given the blame for their lives taking the wrong turns, and Adam and Mia find their way back to each other (even if they had both been hanging on to each other the whole time without the other knowing it).    I suppose reviews of this book aren't really necessary, because if you liked If I Stay you're going to read it, and if you didn't, you're not; but I just had to say how much I loved it. READ IT, maybe even if you didn't like the first one.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Samsung Vibrant here and the only thing this app is good for is force closing. Amazon free app of the day should not have this issue.

B0033TJATW|5.0|this is a wonderful classic made by MJ. My grandson has the MJ experience game and when I told him there was a movie of one of the game videos he didn't beleive it now he can't stop watching it*s*
0061726826|4.0|I recently discovered that I'm a big fan of the dystopian genre, and I'm a dark-and-twisty romantic (as my sister calls it), so this book was absolutely perfect for me. Okay maybe not \\"perfect,\\" because at certain points the signature Lauren Oliver overdescription had me a little uninterested, but by the middle of this book I couldn't stop reading. I always try to pace myself so it takes no less than a week to read a book (can't really afford a higher reading rate), and it was pretty difficult with this one despite the 441 pages. I was hesitant to read another Lauren Oliver book because I absolutely hated Before I Fall, but I'm glad I did. I started it exactly one week ago, just finished it, and am already writing a review.  The characters in this book are realistic and believable, and the romance isn't exactly out of nowhere. It might seem like it at first, but once you realize that Alex has kind of known Lena longer than she thinks, it makes you a little more comfortable with it. There were funny parts, especially between Lena and her best friend Hana, and heartbreaking parts. I liked that this book is considered \\"young adult,\\" because even though I'm 20 years old and prefer more mature books, I'm not a fan of graphic love scenes. In Delirium, the author found a way to convey the romance without such scenes, for which I was grateful.  This is the perfect book for fans of [[ASIN:0525423648 Matched]] and even The Hunger Games (though of course, it is a lighter subject material than in The Hunger Games books, which are still at the top of my list). Be warned: the end is a bit of a heartbreaking cliffhanger-- reminiscent of the end of the first Hunger Games book-- so you'll be dying for the sequel to come out, which doesn't seem to be anytime soon enough.
B004FOA84A|1.0|app force closes every time I try to open. no point in installing an app that does not work, just wastes disk space. I should have listened to other reviews and not installed this. HTC incredible.

0893815233|4.0|View the work included in Sally Mann's Immediate Family just once, and it will be sure to stay with you forever.  The haunting images of the artist's children living their lives and acting like adults have an almost ethereal, otherworldly, dreamlike quality.  She poses her children for these portraits of them growing up and running around their Virginia home, but she poses them in a natural, realistic way.  Mann does not rely on tableaus and grandeur to tell a story with her photographs, she instead uses simplicity to create striking works of art with subjects whose eyes stare straight through you.    Her third and most successful photography book, Immediate Family's photographs are shot only in black and white with a large format camera.  The deliberate choice to use an antiquated photographic process such as an 8 x 10 camera give Mann's photographs a timeless feel.  The fact that the subjects are mostly naked and the smoothness of the photo quality lends to this feeling as well; they could almost be oil paintings from another era.      The beauty in these works all but hits you over the head with a mallet when first viewed, but it is only after multiple viewings that you realize what makes them so pleasing.  It's the subtle textures and the small, almost hidden details that capture your eye and never allow it to leave.

B004927I50|1.0|Well, I had ordered a \\"special edition\\" of Taylor Swift's CD, \\"Speak Now,\\" which was supposed to have included extra tracks and videos. Unfortunately, the seller who advertised the product delivered a truly inferior disk. It had only a total of six tracks and didn't even include the title song! Well, I contacted the seller and pretty much just got the runaround. I really want to let other buyers know about this seller, so they don't get ripped off like I did. I've been an Amazon customer for more than 12 years now, buying both new and used items, and this is the very first time I've been wantonly ripped off. Here is the \\"company\\" in question:      \\"press_play_connection - Amazon Marketplace\\" [...]    I recommend that you avoid them. They simply don't make good on their promises.
B004FOA84A|4.0|didn't take too long to finish but very enjoyable. no issues while playing. loved the music. I hope they make a sequel or three. well worth the null money spent
B004FOA84A|3.0|overall great concept, but it needs more substance and some more storyline. While playing it, it gives the sense that something is missing. Devs should put more in or find a way to add more substance.

1594202559|4.0|More money than God : [hedge funds and the making of a new elite]Mallaby, Sebastian. **** NY Times Top Books of 2010 review, SPL 332.64524 M<br />I thought this was a great overview of the hedge fund industry.  In truth the older stuff, like A.W. Jones, is vastly less interesting to me that the more current history, I could have used a bit less of that, but it does provide valuable context I suppose.<br />The stories about Steinhardt does much of the same, and you do get a feel for how the industry has changed which is helpful in understanding trends and thus how to project out to the future.<br /><br />One of the most thoughtful analyses of the conflicts behind regulation and the lessons from LTCM.  Analysis of leverage is not straightforward, let alone regulation of it. Capital at risk v. value at risk calculations need to be and are rarely straightforward.  The LTCM partners had their own capital at risk, which shows my \\"skin in the game\\" theory is not an adequate protection.  Brokers didn't adequately police (although I would argue that short term thinking there was a part of the culprit).  A lot of this does support Taleb's black swan thinking generally.<br /><br />The one area I felt was perhaps the least fair and balanced is the one, perhaps not coincidentally, that I'm most familiar with, namely John Paulson and the Goldman Sachs SEC investigation regarding CDOs.  I think there's real evidence that Paulson was fairly unscrupulous, although perhaps not illegal in the way he participated in influencing the creation of CDOs he subsequently bet against, and this book makes no mention of that at all.  Given this omission in the area I'm most familiar with, I can't help but feel there are others as well.<br /><br />I found the mixed strategy funds the most confusing, I'm not sure whether this is due to the fact the are less philosophically coherent or just that the explanation was less complete.<br /><br />He concludes with a well reasoned recommendation for regulating Hedge funds, noting that \\"Between 2000 and 2009 5000 hedge funds have failed and not a single one of them required a gov't bailout.\\"  But also notes that going forward they are heading in the direction that will cause them to get larger, go public and thus lose not just the incentive structure, but their \\"small enough to fail\\" status as a result of their size and leverage.n 2000 and 2009 5000 hedge funds have failed and not a single one of them required a gov't bailout.\\"  But also notes that going forward they are heading in the direction that will cause them to get larger, go public and thus lose not just the incentive structure, but their \\"small enough to fail\\" status as a result of their size and leverage.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Beautiful romantic thriller shot with the gorgeous backdrop of Italy and it's two stunning stars, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.  It doesn't get anymore exotic than that.  I found this film entertaining to the senses.  I was pleasantly surprised as I expected it to be bad after not hearing anything great about it.  That's a good way to watch a film.  Go in with low expectations and form your own opinion.
B00000K3D4|2.0|On the positive side the musical numbers are among cinema's most ridiculous, especially David \\"Goblin King\\" Bowies'  warbling. This is the moment when any whiff of cool Bowie had disappears in a puff of fairy dust. Its also rare that a movie achieves a level of awful so profound on so many levels and even rarer that the end result is as entertaining as Labyrinth. Its true I enjoyed watching it for the bucket loads of  unintentional comedy that it supplies more than anything else. Actually to the exclusion of anything else. But alas that high level of gawdawful can't possibly be maintained and the movie gradually devolves to what I imagine The Wizard Of Oz would have been like if it was made during a writer's strike. I have to say about half way in I ceased to care. But then I'm far from being a twelve year old girl which appears to be the target audience.

1594484775|4.0|After returning to Gooleness, the dismal seaside town in North-Eastern England where they live, Duncan receives a CD of 'Juliet, Naked', an album of solo acoustic demos of the songs on 'Juliet'. Annie opens it first and listens to it on her own. Duncan is angry, especially when she expresses her dislike for it. He writes an enthusiastic review for the fan website he is a member of. Annie writes a passionate article criticising it and receives an email response from Tucker Crowe himself. Further email correspondence ensues, much of which consumes Annie's thoughts.<br />Tucker Crowe is in Pennsylvania preparing for a visit from his daughter Lizzie whom he has never seen before. He has five children from four relationships, and his youngest son Jackson and Jackson's mother Cat are the only ones he lives with. Lizzie reveals she is pregnant and this has caused the visit.<br />Duncan meets a new colleague called Gina, whom he sleeps with. He tells Annie of his affair and she insists he move out. The next day Annie talks to her judgmental therapist Malcolm. Duncan regrets leaving Annie but she refuses to take him back.<br />Cat breaks up with Tucker but Tucker remains looking after Jackson. Annie places a photo of Tucker and Jackson on her fridge and invites Duncan round to make him see it, gleeful that he doesn't know the significance, and tells him she is in a relationship with him.<br />She ponders the years she has wasted with Duncan and ends up going to the pub with her friend Ros, during which she meets Gav and Barnesy, northern soul dancers. Barnesy comes back to her house and tells her he loves her but she says she won't sleep with him and he leaves. Annie discusses the incident the next day with Malcolm.<br />Tucker discovers that Lizzie has lost the baby and Cat talks him into visiting Lizzie. On arrival in London, Tucker has a heart attack and is taken into the hospital. Lizzie invites all his children and ex-wives to visit for a family reunion.<br />A mini-narrative describes the events which caused Tucker to end his career after hearing that he had a daughter, Grace from the relationship before/during Julie.<br />Annie visits him in the hospital and he suggests staying at her house to avoid the family reunion. The next day Annie visits again and they do, though Annie discovers he had not yet met with Grace. Tucker tells her about Grace and Juliet and Annie insists he call his family.<br />They discuss his work; Tucker sees it as inauthentic rubbish while Annie thinks it's deep and meaningful music while clarifying that while the music is good it doesn't mean that Tucker as a person is good. She also admits that she was in a relationship with Duncan, whom Tucker knows of from the website. Annie encourages Tucker to meet Duncan but he refuses. The next day they bump into Duncan. Tucker introduces himself but Duncan doesn't believe him. After considering it, Duncan comes over and Tucker shows Duncan his passport as proof. They have tea together and Tucker clarifies some of Duncan's beliefs about him, while Duncan expresses his love of his music.<br />Grace calls Tucker. She says she understands how he and she can't be close because it would mean giving up 'Juliet'.<br />An exhibition Annie has been working on opens at the Gooleness museum, where she works as a curator. She suggests that Tucker could open it but the councillor in charge says he's never heard of him and invites Gav and Barnsey (two local Northern Soul dancers) to do it instead. At the party Annie admits to Tucker that she likes him romantically and afterwards they have sex. Annie says she has used a contraceptive but didn't. Tucker and Jackson return to America. Annie tells Malcolm about it all and tells him that she would like to sell her house and move right away to America to join Tucker and Jackson. Malcolm's paternalistic comment lets her realize that she's cured. She can then leave him.<br />In the epilogue, Duncan and other fans review on the fan website a new release from Tucker, which they think is terrible because 'Happiness Is Poison', as one of them writes. Only one new member says she and her husband love the new album, while they find 'Juliet' gloomy for their liking.<br /><br />There's a summary I borrowed from Wikipedia.  I just wanted to give my opinion on the book after that.  A book about obsession with a singer who hasn't performed in over 15 years, and his last album, called Juliet, is considered by his obsessive fans to be the best work of art ever made.  Then, a \\"bootleg\\" copy of Juliet comes out, one that was an acoustic and earlier version of the songs on Juliet comes out.  Duncan is so eager to post a positive review and to be the first in his little community to do it that he becomes a little too enthusiastic about a record that became another record, and that record being seen as far superior upon closer examination.  This guy owns all the bootlegs of almost every performance this Tucker Crowe ever sang at.<br /><br />A lot of people have obsessions with particular bands, especially ones that disappeared suddenly for one reason or another.  I know that I am guilty of this when it comes to the ska-punk band Sublime.  I own everything they've ever put out, before and after the lead singer's death.  So I know the mindset of this guy, but I don't make it my whole life, like he has.  Very interesting novel about obsession and how it can cause you to do crazy things, like cheat on your partner of 15 years because the person you talked to liked the album your partner did not.

0142403873|5.0|I recently bought this book and a few others for my five year old son. I chose it based on reviews alone.  When it arrived I read through it first.  I was not impressed and could not see what all the hype was about.  But I read it to him anyway for his opinion. He loved it!!! He did not want to read the other books and even after we did Gruffalo remained his favorite by far.  He asks for it every single night.  My nine year old daughter even likes to sit in when we read it.  Definitely a great buy.

The double pack is supposed to come with a digital copy as well, and I was looking forward to loading that on my iPad.

I liked how even though Ender was an \\"underdog\\" he was very clever and came out on top when others made things tough for him.<br /><br />If you like stories about mind games, leadership, friendship, military strategy/training or science fiction, you will like this book!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie. The script is audacious, the cinematography is in your face and gritty, and Robert De Niro's holds up the movie on his very own.     Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi driving nobody who has served in a Vietnam and goes to pornographic movie theaters, making small talk with the woman who sells the food and candy. The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with \\"trash\\". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story.    No one could have made this movie except Scorsese. Everything you would expect, the camera angles, settings and cast are done perfectly.

Needles to say it is a standard formula but well acted. Well maybe the dialog is a tad hokey but that is part of the fun.

Keep these type of games coming!
B000MX7V5M|4.0|So much has been said about this classic already that I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />To Catch A Thief (1955) is a very classy and lighthearted Alfred Hitchcock romantic thriller.  This was Grace Kelly's third and final movie with Hitchcock.  The following year she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco and became the Princess of Monaco and it marked the end of her acting career, though she still wanted to act.  The story?  This is one of those movies where I care less about the story and more about what I see on the screen.  In other words, Grace Kelly.  Duh!  Her presence lures me in.  I say who cares about the story!  I think of this movie as a movie that was really meant to show off Grace Kelly, the French Riviera, and the immense talent of costume designer Edith Head.  There are times when watching this movie that I actually forget that it's about a retired jewel thief who is suspected of stealing again and is out to clear his name because the movie starts off strong, then slows down a lot, then finishes strong.  The beginning and end of the movie have the most Hitchcock \\"feel\\" of suspense.  The slower middle part, in my opinion, is a fancy and often lighthearted show -  a romance between John Robie (Cary Grant) and Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly), with fabulous wardrobes, fireworks, and the scenery of the French Riviera.  I don't mind this.  I think it's refreshingly different.  But if you're expecting to see a Hitchcock movie with a lot of suspense and some darkness, see one of his other movies, such as Psycho (1960), Vertigo (1958), Rear Window (1954), Notorious (1946), The Birds (1963), Dial M For Murder (1954), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), North By Northwest (1959), Rebecca (1940), Strangers On A Train (1951), Frenzy (1972), Saboteur (1942), Spellbound (1945), or Marnie (1964).<br /><br />One eerie thing about this movie is that the high speed driving scene with Grace Kelly driving and Cary Grant in the passenger seat was filmed not far from the area where Grace Kelly was driving when she had a stroke and crashed her car with daughter Stephanie in the car with her in September 1982.  It's kind of spooky to see this.  It's a shame what happened to her.<br /><br />The musical score by Lyn Murray is good.  This DVD has a lot of extras, which include Writing and Casting To Catch A Thief, The Making Of To Catch A Thief, Alfred Hitchcock and To Catch A Thief: An Appreciation, and Edith Head - The Paramount Years.  It also has the theatrical trailer and audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and Laurent Bouzereau.<br /><br />Overall, I give this movie 4 1/4 stars, rounded down to 4.  It's a good movie that I recommend.far from the area where Grace Kelly was driving when she had a stroke and crashed her car with daughter Stephanie in the car with her in September 1982.

B001992NW4|5.0|I remember waiting on a long line outside the Paris theater in Manhattan to see The Exorcist during its original run in 1973.  About 6 months later it made it to my local theater in Brooklyn and I waited on an enormous line to see it again.  If you weren't around at the time, this film created quite a stir during its original release. Its all that people were talking about and everyone (including myself) were out reading the novel as a result.<br />This blu-ray edition is the best edition I've seen yet.  This 2 disc set includes the version that was released in the movies and the version with the eleven minutes of additional scenes (including Regan's infamous \\"spider-walk.\\")  The picture and sound are obviously excellent.  The disc with the extened version includes a new 3 part retrospective with director William Friedkin, Producer/Writer William Peter Blatty, Cinematographer Owen Roizman and Linda Blair.  The disc with the original version includes a 1998 BBC documentary including interviews with Friedkin, Blatty and most of the surviving (as of 1998) cast members.  It is interesting to see how young Max Von Sydow actually was when he made The Exorcist.  The make-up turning him into an old man is almost as impressive as Linda Blair's demonic make-up.)  It is interesting to note that Blatty states his objections several times to labeling The Exorcist a horror film, he prefers a religious suspense thriller. I agree with him, I've never considered The Exorcist a horror film.  A shocker perhaps, but a horror film seems wrong.  (For the record, I still think \\"Psycho\\" is  the scariest film ever made.)  There are commentaries on both discs, trailers, etc. etc.<br />If you own a blu-ray player, this blu-ray release of this all-time classic is the  one to get.  I highly recommend it.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This is a great futuristic, dystopian sci-fi. THis is probably my favorite Christian Bale movie but booooyy did Tate Diggs go out like a hoe? Oh well what do you expect?
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Emily Rose stars as FBI agent Audrey Parker, in Haven (2010) a 13 episode series produced by the Sy Fy Channel, that like The X-Files, contains a strong paranormal element.  Very loosely based on the novel \\"The Colorado Kid\\" by Steven King, Haven is a program with an atmosphere of mystery, where you are never quite sure what may occur.  Woven into the events of various episodes are hints of hidden secrets, and indications that some bigger master plan is in motion.  The plot is convoluted, so viewing the episodes in order is highly recommended.<br /><br />After going through some stressful times, FBI agent Audrey Parker is sent by her boss agent Howard (Maurice Dean Wint), to the town of Haven, Maine, to investigate the death of an escaped prisoner.  On the way to Haven she is introduced to \\"the troubles\\", weird paranormal forces and events, that the town is known for.  The city girl experiences some problems with being accepted by the locals, but manages to affiliate herself with the local police department, headed by Chief Garland Wuornos (Nicholas Campbell), and his son Nathan (Lucas Bryant), who does not feel pain.  Nathan and Audrey become partners, and begin to investigate further manifestations of \\"the troubles\\".<br /><br />Audrey Parker's past becomes an ongoing mystery.  She is an orphan who never knew her mother, and is intrigued when she finds a newspaper article with a photograph of a woman named Lucy, who looks quite like her.  The title of the article is \\"Who Killed the Colorado Kid?\\"  After an unexpected fall into the water, Audrey is rescued by Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour).  Crocker runs a restaurant, lives aboard a boat, and apparently has some connection with the mysterious Lucy.  Audrey's interest in discovering more about her nebulous past, and pressure from agent Howard , leads to her resigning from the FBI, and joining the Haven police force.<br /><br />The stories usually feature some whacky supernatural phenomena.  If you are looking for a CSI type police procedural, you may be somewhat disappointed.  In the episode \\"Sketchy\\", drawings of a real person or place, have the power to physically affect that real object.  When a portrait falls into the water and sinks to the bottom, the person in the drawing drowns.  In \\"Fur\\", members of the local hunting club are dying, apparently killed by attacking animals that appear to be stuffed.  The strange events seem to be tied to a local taxidermist.<br /><br />Season One Episode list:<br />1.  Welcome To Haven (7/9/10)<br />2.  Butterfly (7/16/10)<br />3.  Harmony (7/23/10)<br />4.  Consumed (7/30/10)<br />5.  Ball And Chain (8/6/10)<br />6.  Fur (8/13/10)<br />7.  Sketchy (8/20/10)<br />8.  Ain't No Sunshine (8/27/10)<br />9.  As You Were (9/10/10)<br />10. The Hand You're Dealt (9/17/10)<br />11. The Trial Of Audrey Parker (9/24/10)<br />12. Resurfacing (10/1/10)<br />13. Spiral (10/8/10)<br /><br />As the season closes, the paranormal activity ramps up, and some of the threads start to come together.  As Haven has been renewed for a second season, we can hopefully look forward to seeing the master plan unfold, and some key questions being answered.  With a quaint rural setting and slower pace, Haven may not be very trendy, but it's a series that usually keeps you engaged, while delivering some unpredictable results.  Emily Rose does a competent job carrying the series, as her character rolls with the supernatural punches, while trying to discover more about her past.  Audrey, Nathan, and Duke, have a dynamic evolving relationship, that has yet to be settled.  Haven is a town with many mysteries, and there is potential for more revelations, but will we ever know who killed the Colorado kid?  Tune in starting July 15, 2011 and see.<br /><br />With recent efforts like Haven, Warehouse 13, and Eureka, the Sy Fy Channel demonstrates that they are capable of producing quality TV series.  With only 13 episodes, the initial retail price for Haven is quite high, but hopefully will decrease over time.  [[ASIN:B002BWP2IK Warehouse 13: Season One]] also had 13 episodes, and the cost of that set has gradually come down to a more reasonable $19.99.des, and the cost of that set has gradually come down to a more reasonable $19.99.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Cool classic point and click puzzle game, reminded me alot of the 7th Guest which is one of my favorite all time games.  Nice crisp graphics, spooky sound and clever puzzles make this an enjoyable, satisfying but short ride.  The game leaves you waning more but cuts short. Beat the game in about an hour and wish there was more game to play which is why i i was glad it was free today. Seen it before wanted to try it and finally goto and was pleased. Hopefully there will be a part 2 or another game based on similar mechanics, story and setting.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great way to have books on hand anywhere you go. You do not have to have a Kindle to use this. Classics like Dickens and Austen are free e-books. Downloading is simple.
B004FOA84A|1.0|it does not even open.  the minute you tap the launcher icon it crashes.  this is pretty sad considering it says its compatible with the xoom.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Don't think of this book as... a book. Think of it as a reference guide. Here, Kawasaki shares some of his most valuable insights about life, business, excellence and communications in short, concise, eminently digestible lessons. Aside from being a great read, it is the perfect gift to a boss, colleague, employee or business peer.<br /><br />I could be wrong, but this is the type of book you will want to keep around and consult from time to time, just to make sure you're doing things right. Definitely worth the money.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I had a blast but finished the game in like twenty minutes I'm glad Amazon put it up for free cuz I would have been pissed to have wasted a dollar on this game. but I guess I could have gotten the 24hour refund lmao
B004FOA84A|1.0|All it does is force close, it won't launch at all. I'm glad I got this when it was free, I'd hate to pay for something like this.
1401310400|5.0|This book is based on a television series \\"Castle\\".  The storyline is very good, and not as complicated as the next book in the series, Naked Heat.  If you enjoy the seies you have to read the book.  If you enjoy the book, you have to watch the series!
B004FOA84A|1.0|game force closes on my moto xoom at startup.  apparently works for some xooms but not others. fix it for a new review. 25 words.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I only got this because it was free today, but I'm so glad I did! Super fun, love all the clues and thinking you have to do. I only wish it was a longer story, or there were others to do once you were done.
B004SBX112|1.0|After waiting a couple of extra days for the game to come out, I can't play it because it cannot connect to the amazon app store even though I have a connection and the app store installed.    After rebooting my phone, it worked.  Only then did I find the ad free version still has ads, just fewer ads.  Moreover, you need the amazon appstore and a data connection to play.  I've since uninstalled this and the amazon appstore.  For all its faults the android market is still better for the consumer.
B004FOA84A|1.0|looked cool but would force close everytime I tried to open it.  hopefully it gets fixed.  amazon won't let me reinstall which is weird   need 25 word min
B0045U9WPU|5.0|With a strong headed girl who lives in fear of catching the delrium. She adn her best friend do everything until She meets Him. She falls in love, the forbidden law for all citizens. She discovers there is a whole new world outside the city she lives in, and that not everyone who they say they are.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Received this knife today and went to work with it. I spent a couple of hours using/testing it. I will say that the first thing I did was to put it in my vise, take a drill with a sanding disc installed and work the handle over. It was necessary to smooth up some poor fit on the scales and sharp ridges that would eventually rub you raw. It only took about ten minutes and wasn't hard, so don't fret. Firstly, I cut a piece of 2\\"X3\\" seasoned hickory in two in about four minutes. The knife is a pretty good chopper and I was surprised at the size of chips this knife could pop out. Then I cut a nice spear point on a 1 1/4\\" rod, the edge bevel on this knife works well for chopping much  like a hatchet chops and control was pretty easy cutting the point. I then shaved the bark off of a stick and feathered the stick for fire starting, it took a little getting used to with such a thick, heavy blade, but all in all it wasn't bad. The edge held up very well and the finish on the knife was hardly marred. The knife arrived sharp and was still sharp after using,(not razor sharp, but sharp).  The sheath was very adequate and has alot of nice features. The knife handle is plenty big for the average man and the knife is fairly well balanced. So, if you are looking for a heavy duty, all around good survival knife at a good price, buy this one.  For the price I would rate it a 9 and if cost were of no consequence, I would still rate it a 7. The knife has lots of pros and few cons, weight and fit of handle scales being the only major cons.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Not long enough, though. The only way I'd excuse the lame ending is if there would be a sequel (hint hint).
B004FOA84A|1.0|tried rebooting my droid 2 and still would fc. too bad, these are great games to pass time with. glad it was a free app download and i didn't waste my money.
0529064847|5.0|Great compliment to my NIV edition. Having at the least, 2 versions, is good to have in my bible study group since some versions of the bible do not contain the same books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great on samsung fascinate.  I love it.  Easy to use.  I recently got a new phone.  All my books synced to my new phone.
0307454541|3.0|This is one of the most hyped books of last couple of years and this reviewer cannot see why.  The story has a cast of too many just for the sake of confusion.  The plot is plodding, the prose is poor and from a standpoint of a mystery, only the confusion of the many characters can mask the whodunit.<br /><br />The main characters are cold, quirky and barely likeable.  There are many times when things just happen to go our \\"heroes\\" way.  Without giving anything away, it is inconceivable that one person could do all of the high tech damage being done without any training at all.  And not only was this person perfect with a keyboard, but was simply able to outwit an entire corporation and the banking system in Switzerland.<br /><br />The plot was hung up on religious fervor and then, suddenly, it wasn't.  The finale was satisfying but hardly described.  The financial attack was basically an overview without any detail at all.  This is from an author that needed nearly fifty family members to smoke screen the mystery earlier in the story.  I guess the editors woke up and decided that enough was enough.<br /><br />Other Scandinavian authors have written better novels that bring the atmosphere of that region to the reader.  The locale of this novel could have been anywhere for as much as the author used it.<br /><br />I am rounding it up to three stars for an adequate plot and at least a satisfying ending.
B004FOA84A|4.0|a little to short, but for the price of a candy bar well worth it. my 7 year old son and I loved this. I assisted him in solving a few of the puzzles but for the most part he was able to figure them out. this game brought back memories of the game Myst. I would love to see that game brought to android....
B00280LYIC|5.0|I downloaded this to Kindle for Android its very clear and easy to access and a great read and movie
B000PHNHMQ|4.0|I have to begin by noting that there is a noted price difference between this Makita model and its competitors...I can't say peers as I think this product is not a peer of the cheaper made models by any comparison.  But I have to note that it is much more expensive which begs the question? Why    Well its better made, this is not the weekender model, its made for the everyday JOBSITE.  That being said though it is not heavy it is well built and hence heavier than the competing models.  It's nearly 7#'s dry...but it has a metal in feed and casing. The cheaper Hitachi has plastic ( the more comparable porter cable has metal also).    This unit fired all nails equally well but really stood out on the 2 inch nails. Some guns (porter cable) tend to over fire on the longer nails and dialing in the depth can be problematic resulting in sometimes proud heads or sometimes overdriven heads.  This may seem trivial till you shoot 1000 nails of trim and then go back for fill and finish (ie: filling in all nail heads for a perfect finish for paint or staining)    As a PRO carpenter I have to say I appreciated the consistency of this unit and the flawless nailing. The case is a must for any pro or even homeowner that takes care of his/her tools. I also have the Porter cable 2inch brad and if I had to purchase another would get another Makita.  They are close in price but I feel the Makita is built better and more consistent with nailing.    Cons of the unit: the huge head for nail placement...its 1/8 by an 1/8th which is fine for wall trim but not for ¼ round  or bead trims...I marked it with whiteout so I could find center more easily (this is the one thing my porter has over this unit)    Second and this applies to all manufactures in this category of nailer...give us a bigger window for seeing how many nails we have left.   Especially when your on a dedicated trim job its annoying to not notice till your locked out...a 10 nail warning would be great (that's one window basically)     All and all an excellent unit
B004FOA84A|1.0|All it does is force close immediately. HTC Evo Shift 4G. Would like to at least try it. Dang 25 word limit, im just trying to rate the app lol.
B004FOA84A|2.0|this game has a great concept. fans of old point and click adventure games like the Myst series will find a lot to like. However the game is way too short and easy. Possible to beat in 15 min. also there are some game killing bugs. you have to pick the inventory in the right order or else items will disappear forcing you to restart the game.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Pretty fun, but was able to beat the game in less than an hour...  Balsa wood is fun to carve into pine wood derby mobiles...
1593272774|4.0|Everybody loves Legos.  Heck, my 8-year old son is still using the Legos I saved in a storage bin from when I was a kid.  A timeless classic.    Lego books can be good source of inspiration for the Lego builders of the world.  This book achieves that as well by providing inspiring pictures and ideas.  Like typical Lego instructions, just pictures and no words.  My son was able to build a few models based on the pictures and on a few others he didn't quite achieve the model but his attempts still evolved into some interesting creations.    The main thing to note with this book is that the typical Lego player will not have all the parts as represented in this book.  So you can either do what you can with what you've got (as my son did), or treat it as an easter egg hunt and scour the internet to add the missing pieces to your collection.    My review title says \\"not so simple\\" because there are pictures only and you probably won't have all the parts, hence minus 1 star.  Overall, good book and if you are a Lego jockey the price of this book is reasonable and there is no downside to adding it to your collection.
0316056863|4.0|As a fan of 30 Rock (and Mean Girls!), I was excited when I heard that Tina Fey had written a book. And just from a look at the back cover, it seemed like it would be funny. (\\"Totally worth it.\\" ~Trees) Not to mention the very positive review from Entertainment Weekly.     I started reading the book and though at first I wasn't enjoying it as much as I expected, there were still good moments and funny and even a little illuminating. Despite the slow start (particularly the chapter about her father Don Fey), the book got funnier as it got into more familiar territory (specifically, her time on Saturday Night Live and how that transitioned into 30 Rock).     There is more in here than just a bunch of self-deprecating humor. Mixed in between her humorous anecdotes (her makeup tops, for example) are an interesting look into the male dominated world that is comedy writing. (I have a friend trying to break into this world and she is finding much of what Fey described.) We also get some good tips about how best to manage people (using examples of how she runs the show). Fey shows a sarcastic, determined, funny persona that has helped her become the successful, if quirky woman that she is. She is clearly hardworking and has earned her way.     At the same time, this isn't a tell-all. We don't delve deeply into any particular experience (for example she talks about being slashed in the face as a child but discusses how other people bring up her scar more than the actual incident, we get only a cursory look at her time on SNL, etc). There are times when I would have liked to hear more, such as a look into her work on Mean Girls or some more about the people she has worked with (we get a decent amount about Amy Poehler and Alec Baldwin, but few others). Even with that, it was enjoyable and insightful. (This would probably be hysterical as an audiobook read by Fey.) It was nice getting to know a little more about Fey, who seems to be a slightly higher functioning version of LizLemon and I would definitely not be opposed to reading more form her in a few years.
B003JR1JV0|4.0|I give 5 stars for the Can't Be Tamed music content; however, I was bored with the extra Dvd content (maybe because I listened to the songs too much that I got sick of it.), but also because her performances I felt were sloppy? rushed? It's just like a normal concert that is video taped and professionally edited into a dvd. I shouldn't complain though because it is considered an extra, but I just wanted to weigh that in. Good quality audio/good miley voice in the concert dvd, but performances could be better and so could her wardrobe. I'm sure I might be able to watch it in a few years.     Like the cover, love all of the songs -great new change from her previous albums. Her songs are really great. Her cd is a must-have or at least the songs are.     Bottom line is you can't go wrong with the regular or deluxe cd. I got deluxe just because I always have to have the deluxe version.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Good game, great graphics, sound is OK, story is good but TOO short. Beat game in less than an hour, second play through was less than 10 minutes.
B004SBX112|5.0|The update finally came out and we all learned that it wasn't amazon's fault for the delay,  it was rovio's. Amazon app store is still great.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I think this is a fun puzzle game. Yes it is short, and has no replayability, but it kept me busy for a while, which is exactly what a dollar game should do.
B004G6009U|5.0|My kids could watch this over and over again! Great for adults too. Great story and in HD the colors, animation and details are amazing. My family gives it five stars!
B004FOA84A|1.0|&quot;bought&quot; it because it was free today. Never got a got a chance to even get a taste of it because it forced close on startup
B004FOA84A|3.0|The game is a great way to pass the time and the puzzles are fun to solve, but the game felt entirely too short. Needs an expansion or something.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|They change up some of the story chronology and keep out the temple build and trial. It doesn't take away from from the overall story that still stays true to the ideals Rand displayed in her fantastic novel. I don't need to justify this movie anymore. If you read the book, you will enjoy this film.
B001G4C9T4|4.0|Jennifer Hudson has a great voice and the music is right up my alley. Her newer tracks, I think, really show off her style and how she's settled into being an artist.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|I found Black Swan to be one of the most suspenseful but also beautiful motion pictures I have seen in recent years. It is impossible to take your eyes from the screen as the story unfolds its disturbing story-line. A tale of increasing madness that rushes to an inevitable ending. Fantastic acting by the whole cast and in its own way, totally plausible. See it, you won't be disappointed.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I'm not a music expert, I just know what I like and I really like this CD.  What a new and wonderful sound this band has.  The Cave is my favorite.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I really enjoyed this game. The puzzles were pretty decent and clever. My only complaint is that the game is on the short side. I think I put about one hour in on this, maybe a little less.
0307595862|4.0|For whatever reason I'm intrigued by the new wave of Nordic fiction. This was an enjoyable read if a little choppy in transitions for me. Sometimes you finish a book and there's a scene or two you still don't get or understand. There were definitely a couple here for me but it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment. Interesting characters with their requisite foibles and histories. Not the most surprising developments although some were a bit bizarre. If you liked the Larsson trilogy it's probably worth giving this a try and giving it a chance to settle in. I would read something by Nesbo again...
B004FOA84A|4.0|great graphics... fun gameplay... just went by too fast and now I want more... can't wait for some updates or a sequal great free app of the day
B004FOA84A|3.0|this game Is a a lot like myst . the graphics are pre rendered pictures.  the game is not awful but its very short . if it was longer and the end wasn't so Meh then I woulda gave this a better rating .
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great, but too short. Definitely need more games like this on Android. HTC Incredible CM7  What's up with the 25 word minimum, Amazon? So annoying.
3836503050|5.0|I am a fan of all kinds of retro 'pop art'.  This book is a great addition to any art collection.  The book is hardcover, large photos, bright colors.  At the price it is at, this is one of my best purchases from Amazon.  The girls are all in similar poses, situations, but they are all gorgeous and take you back to the golden years of Americana.  I would warn any parents that their is some photos/drawings of full nudity (which I didn't expect). Not many, but a few. I planned on keeping this out as a coffee table book, but with some young boys running around the house, I will keep it in my bedroom bookcase.  To wrap up, at this price in my opinion this is a no brainer purchase.  5 stars.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Its a great puzzle and really had me thinking at times. Gotta admit it was a little sort and I'm glad I didn't buy it. But for a .99 game its awesome
0345529057|5.0|I love this series and I always wanted all the books. Yay! Dream come true!    If you have never read the books, the show on HBO is sticking fairly close to the main events right now. But if you don't watch the show, the best part of all of the books, is the rich description of a land steeped in history and culture. Someone described to me as a fantasy series for people who like Merlin and King Arthur a little more than orcs or fairies.
B002ZG976U|1.0|Looking at the other reviews for this film, I am forced to ask myself if this page is some kind of meme I missed on reddit. Burlesque is the worst film I saw in the last decade. People claim to have been choked up by the performances, but the only gagging I did was after any of Aguilera's lines. Others claimed they cried-- the only cry I had was after Cher's absurdly melodramatic numbers, and my tears welled up as part of the laughing fit that I had to contain so as not to disturb the other poor folks who also made the mistake of buying a ticket to this camp fest. I knew what I thought I was getting into, but this was so ridiculous, it was not any fun. The plague is more favorable than the dynamic duo of divas that comprise the cast of this mediocre piece of trash.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am one of the many fans who got totally involved in the series \\"Firefly\\", even though the network did just about everything they could to sabotage it.  I mean, really??  The pilot wasn't aired first and several episodes were out of order.    And I am ever so grateful that \\"Serenity\\", the movie, was made to tie up the storyline left open by \\"Firefly\\".  Of course, it left me wanting even more from the crew of \\"Serenity\\".  It was so well done it has become one of my most watched tv series and movie.  Every now and then I just HAVE TO see it all unfold all over again.
0061537969|5.0|I had seen this title on the bestseller list for months and always ignored it.  A dog's view of auto racing?  Not for me, I thought.  But I finally gave in and bought it, figuring it must have something to have remained up there so long.  Well, it might be one of the best reads I've had in quite a while (and I've read some pretty good books of late).      You'll fall in love with Enzo right out of the gate.  And believe me, he deserves it.  Every time I look at my dog, Carmie, now, I hope that someday she'll have as good a tale to tell and do it as well as he did.  Without benefit of Garth Stein, probably not, but one can always hope!
B004FOA84A|1.0|I read the reviews and it seems that some Xoom users were able to use the program with no problem. I installed the program, opened it and it crashes every time.....  BOOOO!!!  and I don't mean boo in a scary way. LOL
B004FOA84A|1.0|Does not work on LG Vortex. Force closes before it even opens. Tried restarting phone, but no change. Will rate better when or if fixed.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force close on wifi xoom.  Does not open at all.  At least I was not out anything because of the free app from amazon.  I would really like to see this game work on the xoom.
B0017JKEL8|4.0|Cro-Magnon sensibilities and habits combined with modern self-doubt and self-destruction yields a potent and intriguing television drama. There is great joy in celebrating the era which is shown in the wonderful attention to detail. This attention also is shown in the way Mad Men delves into the effects of that era on the American psyche. If you grew up in that era you will be constantly be entertained by the period detail and the take on the rise of the American corporate beast. This is the Industrial Military Complex defined. If you are younger and seeing it for the first time you should not discount the hedonism, greed and avarice that permeates every episode. They were and still are the defining characteristics of the post WW II American evolution. It's also what built the powerful economy that now is in tatters. The same types of men doing the same types of jobs you see in Mad Men now worry about how fast they can get out of the American market. They only want to tap into the international economy that is swiftly passing us by in order to continue the ritual. This series is highly recommended to fans of ennui and the smoking of many cigarettes. Hey, that sounds almost...French.
B004FOA84A|5.0|the game is lots of fun.  would definitely like to see a sequel.  it force closed a couple times on xoom but not a big deal.
0525422943|5.0|Three years ago Mia made a choice. Her boyfriend Adam was prepared to let Mia go if it meant she would be okay. He thought that would be enough.<br /><br />Three years later: Adam knows he was wrong.<br /><br />Mia is gone. She left. She's on the opposite coast at Juilliard just like she should be with her bright star on the rise. She walked away from Adam and never looked back.<br /><br />Adam is living in LA. He's dating a beautiful actress. He's partly responsible for his band's meteoric rise to rock stardom. He has everything he ever wanted. Except without Mia none of it seems to matter.<br /><br />Three years ago an accident changed Mia and Adam's lives forever.<br /><br />Three years later an accidental meeting in New York City will change everything all over again in Where She Went (2011) by Gayle Forman.<br /><br />Where She Went is the sequel to Forman's poignant novel If I Stay.<br /><br />Narrated by Adam (If I Stay was written in Mia's voice), Where She Went follows a similar structure to its predecessor. Chapters written in the present tense explaining Adam's current state and the central plot alternate with chapters written in the past tense (prefaced by song lyrics from the album that launched Adam into the world of rock stardom) relate key events that led him to this point. These looks at Adam's past also answer a simple question about Mia, namely: where she went three years ago.<br /><br />In addition to looking at Adam's evolving relationship with Mia, Forman does something really hard in this story. She looks at recovery and rehabilitation without glossing over the messy parts. And she does it really well.<br /><br />When I finished If I Stay I thought it was a perfect book. Forman's sparse writing is poetic and beautiful and so painfully heartfelt. The ending made perfect sense. Even with a tragedy at the core of its plot If I Stay remains one of the most gorgeously optimistic books I've ever read.<br /><br />Where She Went is all of that but, somehow, also more. It's an evocative look at New York City. It's a story about love and loss. It's charming, it's funny, it's moving. In short, Where She Went is everything readers want not only in a sequel but also in any good novel.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Dash and Lily's Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, Falling Through Darkness by Carolyn MacCullough, The Piper's Son by Melina Marchetta*, Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater<br /><br />*I know this is a total pain because The Piper's Son is another sequel and you'll need to read Saving Francesca in addition. BUT I was struck while reading at how similar The Piper's Son and Where She Went are in terms of voice, structure, and just general vibe. I can guarantee 100% that if you enjoy one you will enjoy the other. Trust me.arming, it's funny, it's moving.

B004FOA84A|3.0|the game is fun I enjoyed playing it but it was way too short and I had some problems starting the game ( force close issues).
0756405890|5.0|Honestly, there isn't much I can say about this one that hasn't been said here already. The Name of the Wind is one of my all time favorite books, and one of the best books I have ever read. Patrick Rothfuss is a genius, and I will ready everything he writes for the remainder of his career. Everyone who likes fantasy, epics, orphan stories, underdogs, or magic should read this.
B000002KGT|5.0|Is it even possible that an album from way back when can still be brand new? Yes it is. There are a few of them and this is one! Rubber Soul by The Beatles is another, but I can say without hesitation that I can listen to Rumours in any mood and like it. I can't say that even for the Fab Four on Rubber Soul.    I have literally looked through my entire music collection of Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Classic Rock, Opera, Classical, Alternative and on and Rumours is literally the album that I listen to when I cannot decide on anything else. It's that good. It never gets old. Not even Dire Straights 'Brother's in Arms' is as 'multi-season' as this ultimate masterpiece.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Gads.  It's a really cool looking game (I guess I must be one of the lucky Evo Shift folks that hasn't had the app crash.  Yet.)<br /><br />But it takes a full16MB on a droid's internal memory.  That screaming sound you hear ain't the game.  It's your phone trying to work with this ten-ton game crammed in to it....
B004FOA84A|4.0|it was good. i finished in 30 mins. i like games that are quick. not really a who done it. you are trying to find your grandpa who is missing and he leaves you clues.
1608191664|1.0|If you like big government and socialism you will like the book. However, if you like individual freedom you will not like the book. If you choose to read the book I would balance it with a book with an opposing view point like \\"Economics In One Lesson\\" which is free online([...]
B0018BB20W|5.0|Soundz great to me and my wife. nice to have \\"Days\\" filling the air of our home again. and with this particular release, there's all those bonus tracks. most excellent. I will recommend this disc.
B002DMJL9E|1.0|Bad, crappy, horrible  picture quality!!!    48hours is the best action comedy of all time!   Why doesn't the director, producers , studio, or someone involved with it feel the same way I don't know.  Someone needs to fix the picture quality.  Don't buy this Blu Ray version unless you have to have it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|fun puzzle game, but a little too short for my money. would like more episodes in the future about the grandpa and his findings. the game ran fine on my evo
B004SBX112|5.0|Very fun, entertaining, and time consuming. Ive spent many hours playing this game, would recommend to everyone to try it. Thanks for the constant updates!
B004FOA84A|4.0|It's a pretty short game but I liked it. It's easy to control and has a reset option in case you ever want to play it again. No errors or force closes on my Droid Incredible. Ultimately not bad for being free.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I wont to a spoiler here but I am just so frustrated with the way this book turned the series around.  I put the book down about 1/2 way through and I have to process what I just read and the ramifications of the events that unfolded.  So yes, complex story lines and endearing characters. I will finish this and move to the next, but darn it. I liked the first 2 books much more
1607886278|4.0|This is a moving story.  I realize Room is fiction but could very well be true today.  Some of the words Jack uses are beyond most 5 year old children but his mother does give a fairly plausible explanation.  She has been the only tutor he ever had and not much more to do but teach and play made up games in this exceedingly confined space.  Also the captor did provide a small TV but Ma limited Jack's viewing to only a few hours each day which also helped.  I recommend Room to anyone wanting a good novel.
0143038419|3.0|I saw the movie and enjoyed it, and expected the book to be a lot better, but it actually bored me a bit. It was empowering and uplifting in some parts, but other areas, I felt it was a tad whiny. It did inspire me to look at my own life and ways I could try new challenges.
B004FOA84A|3.0|While the game does look good and is fairly challenging, it is much too short. This was the first app I ever paid for, and I finished it in an hour. Very disappointing. None of the game content changes, so it's exactly the same every time. If you're going to get this game, don't wait; do it today while it's free.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Game worked really well until my screen went to sleep and that wad the end of it.  If I want to play this I need to reinstall and finish it in one sitting.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I can't argue with anything that is free but I did not find the game to be any fun at all. I hope to see more fun free Apps and games from Amazon
B004BLJQOK|4.0|This story is more of a drama, whereas I expected a horror film.  It's a story of love and friendship and accepting people for who they are; something people rarely do.    Reading some of the other reviews may be more useful - I watch movies for entertainment - others were able to evaluate it and dissect it with more knowledge.    As I said - it wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't bad.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app is not working on the motorola atrix. It forces close as soon as I run it. Glad I got it thru the amazon free app a day otherwise I would have been really mad right now.
B00000J048|5.0|What a fantastic toy! Kaleido Gears are so versatile. They are very durable and colorful, too. My son is two and a half, and he loves this toy. I love it because it's something unique and fun we can play with together. This toy can be as simple or complex as you make it. We love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn´t put it down! Read through all three book in the series over a weekend after the first one left me hungry for more.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Won't open at all... Just gives me force.close errors. Sorry folks, I must uninstall.  Too bad. I was hoping for just this kind of game on my Droid.
0393316041|5.0|A regular guy, a genius, a mischievous prankster, a true problem-solver, and out-of-the-box thinker, and ultimately a great role model for distrusting ALL authorities and proving things to yourself.<br /><br />His life reveals how many scientists these days are pretenders.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Just like many other people have stated, there is a major force close issue happening. Droid X here, and I couldn't try it out. Glad it was free or I'd be pretty irate.
B0019NG73G|5.0|This movie (Along with \\"Gods and Generals\\") has to be the two greatest movies ever to depict the civil war. God Bless Ted Turner. He funded both movies. But originally, this was to be a trilogy. The third was named \\"The Last Full Measure\\" from what I have heard, no major studio wanted to fund it, so it was scrapped. What a shame. It all comes down to the almighty dollar.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Will never open, force close every time. Samsung vibrant. I already installed it from my phone, I did not get it to open even once.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Very nice - great graphics and clever puzzles.  Runs great on xoom and droid-x.  for those of you having force close issue on xoom, I had it too - turn off the &quot;lock orientation&quot; in settings.
B004FOA84A|5.0|For all those people who is complaining about it not working on certain phones don't blame amazon they went to alot of trouble getting these free Apps blame the developer. An if it doesn't work on your phone upgrade jeez.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Not a bad little game overall. As was said before... there is no replay value at all. For a feeebie? 5stars... as a paid app? Meh.. 3 stars. If the author keeps adding to the story line, then it'd become more towards 5,rather than 3. Last puzzle was a bit annoying due to some alignment issues. (If you make it to the end, you'll see what I'm talking about.)
0316017922|4.0|Outliers is a book about the exceptional people and businesses that most people know about in today's world. It covers a great many factors that can cause a person to \\"make it big\\" from the effect that birthdays can have on sports players as well as the incidental factors of being born in the right place, at the right time, and with the right genes (though Malcolm Gladwell never covers DNA). Additionally, Gladwell writes about the factors of ability and how IQ only goes so far when it comes to mastering any given subject. There is a roof that humans reach when mastering a subject that is reached sooner than expected. The idea of IQ is also questioned in this book by showing a contrasting kind of intelligence: practical intelligence. This intelligence has little to nothing to do with books and memorization and has everything to do with knowing how to speak to people interpersonally to get what you want. Despite all of the evidence that points to coincidental success, Gladwell also shows research that these successful people also put in a great deal of work, and that work comes to about 10,000 hours of practice before being able to \\"make it big.\\" This last bit of information gives the reader some hope that they, too, may have been born at right time, from the right family, at the right place, etc, and that all that they have to do now is spend the time practicing their passion.<br /><br />The only downside to this book is that the reader is left with little to do with the information that he or she just read about. The reader is left wondering \\"OK, so I've learned about what has made all of these successful people become successful; what now? Can I do anything with this or am I a product of coincidence?\\" Gladwell fails to address the uses for this topic in a practical manner. It's informational, but the information has no place to go.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The reviews by:Dennis A. Amith (kndy); Richard Leafgreen (poiseidonboy)and Tate are all spot-on. this is a 5 star plus blu-ray movie. Still an exellent story - nostalgia from my secodary school years.   Why can't all dvd's / blu-rays of this quality.  Quality DTS sound should be STANDARDIZED to ALL dvd's / blu-rays. We won't mind paying a couple of bugs extra for quality. Those with the gear to utiluze DTS etc. could then still select the other sound options in the set-up menu.  a must buy for all customers of all age groups.  enjoy.  andre
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a pretty good puzzle/find-this game. The graphics are very well done, the music is very atmospheric, and the simple animations (which played well on my Galaxy Tab) added a nice touch to round things out. The story, and ending are pretty weak, and it's a tad short (beat it in under an hour), but it's all about the journey, not the destination right?    Anyone know what's up with that dang bird's nest?
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This movie caught my eye because of the previous satisfaction I have had with other BBC Masterpiece movies. In purchasing \\"Emma\\", I can surely say that this movie was one of the best renditions that I could have added to my collection. The actors capture each of the characters of Miss Austen's work in a flawless, captivating, touching, and highly entertaining manner. I wish to give this movie more than 5 stars. Divided into 4 parts, I simply could hardly wait to begin the next episode. The video clip is good, but the movie is a million times more than that. I cannot stress how enjoyable and quality this \\"Emma\\" is. Buy it now, and you will never regret your purchase. \\"Emma\\"- to be cherished always...
1936719010|4.0|The book was an easy read that respects the reader's time. It wasn't revolutionary, but I'm not reviewing what I wanted the book to be, I'm reviewing the actual book.<br /><br />And the book is a good road map for navigating the resistance and doing the work. Pressfield lays out the 6 things you'll need to succeed, and you might be surprised to find 'stupidity' among that list.<br /><br />The book progresses logically and if you follow the path Pressfield lays out you will start doing work. You will start gaining momentum, you'll come to understand the seven principles of resistance, and you'll produce an emergent outcome. If you do that, Pressfield has succeeded -- and if you don't maybe you need to re-evaluate how bad you want it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Game force closes on Xoom. The force close occurs on startup so unable to evaluate further. Will revisit review if or when it is fixed.
B004FOA84A|1.0|force closes every time. have never been able forum this. Viewsonic gTab fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill fill
B0000669JL|5.0|I have to say that I've been very satisfied with all the purchases I've made through Amazon.com.I've been able to find different artist's music on CDs for a more than reasonable price. I work for Walmart,where I get a 10% discount,and it still cost me less to buy from Amazon.com. Not to mention that they have a wider variety of what I'm looking for.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I bought this case 2 months ago and the easy access is not so easy. I returned it and i get a new one that works better.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I found the puzzles to lack challenge. Would like to see more difficulty, more story, and an over all lengthier experience. On a side note my phone was able to run Windows 7 Ultimate after installing this.
0316069353|1.0|Another disappointing effort by Connelly. That's the problem when the author starts churning two and sometimes more books every year. So the right characters are there, the legal knowledge is there, and who cares? Especially since a highly contrived ending is supposed so spring a big surprise. And there will be a sequel!  Stop press,  the Lincoln Lawyer wants to be District Attorney! However before that story is on the shelves, there is a new Bosch coming in October.  But this time I shall wait for the paperbacks.    Incidentally, though I bought this book hardcover I agree with the Kindle protesters. Too much is too much.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This was a very informative video about our lack of health care in America. The lies that the GOP tells so as not to get universal health care for all Americans is ridiculous. Excellent video.
B004SBX112|2.0|I have read a couple reviews about the update that is now here. seems that the paid version now has ads, wtf!!! what kinda crap is this?? if this is the case I will not be updating. rather have no ads than a studip extra level. can anyone confirm this??
B004FOA84A|5.0|I've been mulling over purchasing this game for a few weeks now.  Yeah, yeah, I know, it's only a $1.  But, if I spent $1 on every game/app that I thought I'd spend more than a few minutes with...<br /><br />Anyhow, I am happy to say I'm very pleased with it.  The graphics, background music, and sound effects all blend well together into a spooky feel.  Controls are easy to work with and respond well.  Gameplay is similar to the old Myst titles, where you wander around solving puzzles and finding clues.  Performance on my Epic was perfect, not a single hitch with it.  Hope to see more games like this one!<br /><br />Hopefully this review was helpful for you.  If not, feel free to leave comments/questions.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Never got to play it. Forced close every time I tried to start it. I heard this game was fun. Very sad :( Samsung fascinate
B004FOA84A|2.0|Really nice graphics, interesting concept, but I was shocked when I reached the end of the game in less than an hour.  What's the point?  To show off the graphics?  Waste of space on my phone's memory!  I would have been really ticked off if I had paid for this!
B004FOA84A|3.0|Decent game but I beat it already after playing it for about an hour. It never force closed on me like all these other people said. DX user..
B004FOA84A|3.0|Nice layout and game play.  Beat the game in under an hour.  Glad I didn't pay for it (thanks Amazon free app of the day).  (so, should I just leave the goldfish in the tub then? LOL).
B003L20IFQ|4.0|Considering there is pretty much only one actor this is a good movie. Somemay have trouble with the amount of air in the box and the Zippo that never runs out but if you can suspend your belief this is an entertaining film
B003UESJHE|2.0|The movie itself was simplistic in its story. Acting was good all round. Still definitely not worth more than one Oscar at the most. Think about this: the number of characters were a handful. Nothing big on costumes. No special effects at all. Shots could have been done with a good handycam. Wonder why the Oscars? Regarding the product itself: the bluray quality was awful. Don't waste money on the bluray. Probably the regular DVD may have a better resolution. Worst bluray resolution I have ever seen.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game was fun, but it was far too short. Had I paid for it, I'd be pretty disappointed. Still, a good brain teaser to kill 30 minutes to an hour on.
B004SBX112|3.0|Just got hit with a nice Ford commercial after 5 min of play. Thats not cool. How come the Android, paid version, dose not have the statistics scale next to each level?
B004FOA84A|4.0|This program does run on Xoom, but I had it force close on me three times before finally launching. Once it launches it seems to be fine. This type of game really lends itself well to a tablet interface. I haven`t played this a whole lot, but what I have played is typical for the genre. You don`t walk around as much as view slides of different rooms and areas. The idea is to locate items and useable objects by tapping various areas of the screen. You use items and objects in the form of `puzzles` to progress the plot.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Keep getting force close on my Evo and gTablet, just goes black and then force close. Funny thing is when I uninstall Amazon app store it works, I can see the start screen below the window that says I must install Amazon app store, ugh!  Please fix this Amazon.
B004FOA84A|3.0|completed this in about 30 minutes. very linear with not much brain power required to figure out what to do. would be a good puzzle set for a 10 year old to figure out. hopefully there will be additional puzzles added otherwise this should really be a free app.
B004SBX112|5.0|Thanks for the update.   Works perfectly.   It amazes me how much complaining most of you are doing.   Come on,  really?   Is your life really that bad?   This is a game that costs 99 cents.   To the people complaining &quot;get a life&quot;. Rovio keep up the great job,  this is still the best game.   Thunderbolt.
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I've been listening to \\"The Fame Monster\\" in my car for weeks, and I think that it's good--not great but good.  There are 4 good songs--\\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Alejandro\\", \\"Speechless\\", and \\"Telephone\\".  The CD is short though, only 8 songs altogether, so the length of the CD doesn't last that long--good for short trips in the car but not long ones.  I recommend it but not exactly enthusiastically.  It's good for easy listening.  It is what it is.
B004FOA84A|1.0|i downloaded the app becuase it sounded interesting, but i went to launch it and it wouldnt even open it just kept force closing. uninstalled- Droid X
B004FOA84A|4.0|I see some reviews complaining of zoom incompatibility.... I have the Wi-Fi only xoom and its working great on my system.   I just downloaded the free app of the day so perhaps any issues that the developer had running it on the xoom has been fixed.  it reminds me of myst .... pretty graphics and decent story line thus far. I just downloaded the game so I cannot see myself giving it 5 stars but it works, its pretty, and its free. that is my 4 star review! lol
B004FOA84A|3.0|Force close on g tab running Froyo 2.2 (3588).  Attemped three times, no luck.  Thanks anyway, keep giving the freebies, some are bound to work.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I got this set for a steal. Midnight special Christmas season and it was way more than worth it!!!!! I love this show and always enjoy having the season to watch whenever. Great quality, great price and great show!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Yes the game is short but it is still fun. Ending is goofy but doesn't ruin the game. No force closes or any problems for me. SGS Vibrant
B004FOA84A|3.0|Title says it all really. Game is great, but force closed repeatedly on launch. I beat it in about two hours, and there's really mo reason to re-play it afterwards. I dig the old-school puzzle / adventure format, but this is far too short.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Wow, this game could be really fun if it wasn't a Force Close monster. When it does run it is absolutely fun. Unfortunately, that is not very often for me.
B004FOA84A|3.0|First of all this is getting rediculous with the negative reviews...this game plays fine on my optimus...If you enjoy mistery type games then give it a try.. It is fun but short and takes up alot of memory i unistalled after beating it.but u cant beat the price of free give it a try if u are into mystery games
B004SBX112|1.0|I joined amazon because I had an account already. Should have made app purchases easier. Updates should be the same date as the android market.
1936594390|3.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.<br /><br />Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how  idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth.

B000H305U0|5.0|Future Sex/Love Sounds is one of the best albums of the decade.  Why?  Future Sex/Love Sounds features a fresh sound that many of the raggedy musical groups of today try to obtain and they can't.  And ironically it didn't need the internet or somekind of viral wonder kid to make it a hit like so many artist today use to sickening failure.

B004FOA84A|3.0|not bad little story but it was super short. worked just fine force close initially but tried again and worked just fine. it is a good puzzle though if you wanna rack your head for a little bit. enjoy.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I Loved it. Please bring more! Not worth a buck though. Get it while its free. Good way to kill an afternoon. No force close issues on g2.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Me and my fiance got this a free app of the day.  When we try to play it it takes us to a black screen then says the games had unexpectedly shut down after 30 secs. I have restarted my phone three times because someone said that would fix it but it didn't. I have an lg vortex and he has the htc droid
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game just force closed every time on my LG G2x. This appears to be a recuring problem for this game. Please fix because I love these kinds of games.
089898890X|5.0|John Riley starts you on the road to understanding the basics of Jazz Drumming and delivers the goods in a clear, easy to follow form.  The pieces begin to make sense as you practice each exercise, while the big picture starts unfolding.  This is the real deal and every drummer should read it.
031261246X|5.0|This is a quick, easy, fun read - a bit of a popcorn book. I found it very reminiscent of Dan Brown, only it didn't jolt me out of the story with technical details which were just plain wrong (which I of course expected of Mark - why would he get the details wrong?). There were a few passages that came of wooden (nobody who actually played computer games would ever talk about them like his characters did - but I understand that someone talking about computer games the way people who play computer games actually talk about computer games would end up being fairly incomprehensible to those who don't) and the insertion of the Sony rootkit story seemed a bit random, but otherwise it was fast paced, fun, thought provoking, and enjoyable. I got through this book WAY faster than I got through Windows Internals.
1936719010|5.0|If I could only own one book on or about writing, it would be Steven Pressfield's fabulous The War of Art, which personifies a negative anti-creative force he names \\"Resistance\\" and gives writers, artists, and others some singularly-helpful tools to overcome the roadblocks that stand between us and the completion of our work. Whenever I find myself paralyzed by self-doubt or mired in distractions, I pull this slim volume off the shelf and-- voila! -- I'm soon back to writing, hell for leather.<br /><br />So it was that I leapt at the chance to pick up a review copy of Pressfield's latest can of creativity whoop-ass, the even slimmer Do the Work!, which was released on April 20, 2011, from Seth Godin's The Domino Project and Amazon, and is being underwritten by GE, allowing free downloads via Amazon's Kindle platform.<br /><br />Or you can pay $7.99 for the hardcover volume, which I suspect you'll want to do after reading the digital copy anyhow. Why? Because this deceptively-slim set of instructions for avoiding procrastination, getting down to work, blasting through the wall to reach the finish line, letting the work go, and learning from disaster, is an absolute gift for any writer who's ever had trouble getting started or bogged down and lost faith (i.e., all of us).<br /><br />I love that he talks about \\"staying stupid,\\" avoiding the impulse to talk ourselves right out of acting (or submitting the fruits of our labor) with endless mental chatter:<br />\\"A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It's only you and I with our big brains and our tiny hearts who doubt and overthink and hesitate.\\"<br /><br />Pressfied, who is also the author of The Legend of Bagger Vance and a number of other novels, doesn't come across as some perfect guru who's never entertained a doubt in his life. Instead, he lays out example after example of how Resistance has kicked his can over the years and how this powerful force is constantly evolving. In this volume, he also expands his theory to talk about the equally powerful force of Assistance, which he uses to describe all those serendipitous helpful people and tools your efforts can and will attract once you begin doing the work you're meant to do. (This rings so true!)<br /><br />When I first received my review copy, I was a bit put off by it's thinness and the amount of type-size overemphasis, as if the reader could not be trusted to pick out the important passages. I was also a bit bothered by what I saw as a lot of rehashing of concepts first laid out in The War of Art, which remains my all-time favorite book for writers. But for anyone who can't get enough of Pressfield's wisdom (raising my hand here) or who wants a simple, deceptively-wise set of tools to get them moving toward their creative goals, Do the Work is definitely a must-buy, on its own or as a companion volume.<br /> --Courtesy, Boxing the Octopus, […]s his theory to talk about the equally powerful force of Assistance, which he uses to describe all those serendipitous helpful people and tools your efforts can and will attract once you begin doing the work you're meant to do.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Tried it on my moto Xoom and it works great, my wife loves this kind of game, I expect she'll enjoy this! It reminds me of playing 7th guest on my friends CD-rom because my computer didn't even have one yet. only played a couple screen, but it's fun so far.
B004FOA84A|3.0|it would have been nice if there were a few more puzzles or areas to explore.  I think i finished in 30mins and was left wanting more.  thankfully i got it free
B000HF6XKO|1.0|Maybe if I read some of the story line ahead of time I would have enjoyed it more but I just couldn't put it together. Too many different characters and plots without the connecting dots.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Love this type of game, and this one is well done, albeit much shorter than I would like. Not sure about all you with FC issues. No problems on MyTouch4G.
B004FOA84A|3.0|The game was fun until it forced closed. Now I can't even open it. Ay least is was Amazon's free app so I didn't waste a dollar. HTC Hero
B004W5T2RG|3.0|I wanted to love this movie. There were some good bits and Gwyneth Paltrow does have a lovely voice. Too bad there wasn't more singing and less dialogue because it just dragged on and on. Boring!
B004FOA84A|3.0|Good game, decent graphics, but mainly its just still pictures.  Some puzzles we hard to figure out, but not horrible.  Glad I didn't pay for it, very short game.  Would serve better as a demo/introduction type of thing.  Hopefully more will be added.
B004FOA84A|2.0|this game was fun, looked nice and was put together well.  only problem is the length of the game.  I finished it within half an hour.  If this was a free app I would have given 4 stars, but there are plenty of other free games that will entertain longer.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|Good movie.Fantastic special effects!!!  I knew it was only the first part..and it left off at just the right place....so I didn't feel really hanging.But good and looking forward to the 2nd part.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I agree with everyone else that the game is very short. I had it finished in half an hour. I didn't have force close issues though, which was nice. It is a huge file and takes up a lot of room, but once you play it you can remove it, so it takes up space for a little while. I'm glad it was free, I'd be ticked paying for a game so short.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I love Myst and was looking forward to playing this game. Unfortunately it kept force closing every time I ran it, I even uninstalled it and installed it again with the same results. Had plenty of free ram & internal memory.   LG Optimus S Froyo 2.2.2.    Update - it works flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2!
B004FOA84A|3.0|I haven't played the game yet. I'm sure it is awesome. However, right away I am disappointed to learn that it is a 16 mb download with no apps to sd support. No bueno. My Galaxy s 4g has limited internal memory so I am not able to keep this game. Sad.
B00001PE4D|3.0|I love teen movies, like Can't Hardly Wait & Wild Things (which really isn't a teen movie but oh well), so I decided to watch Cruel Intentions, it had a good cast so that excited me. So, I'm watching it and it's not really that good. I was kind of bored, I thought it could of been so much better but I had expectations up too high. I think Wild Things is much better and enjoyable than this one. And the \\"lesbian\\" kissing scene in this one, is not very tasteful at all, it has bubbles of saliva, and it was kind of gross watching because their spit and stuff. But yeah, the movie isn't great. The idea was okay. If you have to see it, I say RENT IT.
B004FOA84A|3.0|works fine second time around, kept forcing close so i uninstalled then reinstalled and now it works fine. hopefully it doesnt force close anymore or i might uninstall for good. droid x
B003Q6D27S|5.0|I'm not going to lie, but I enjoyed it! I saw it in 3D in the theaters and couldn't help but buy it when it hit DVD, but I obviously waited for the price to lower! I think this is one of the weakest ones in the series. I'd rather watch SAW II, which is the best SAW movie I believe. The first one doesn't really do it for me, I like it better when there's a group of people not just a pair. But I think this one is a good and would recommend you to buy it. Buy don't buy it at normal price!
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a fun little puzzle game. it force closes on opening once in a while but if you try a few times it opens up. a little short but is a good challenge. idk if I could say it's worth the dollar since once it's done there is no point to play again. as the free app it's a good way to speed up an hour of down time.
B004FOA84A|4.0|people sayin app2sd for this doesnt work are wrong and yes it does run with android 2.3, so wrong again reviewers. great puzzle game but ment for younger crowd
0525423273|4.0|In the words of Fancy Nancy (yes, I have a 4 year old and I steal from her favorite books sometimes) Ooh la, la! That's the best way for me to sum up this book. Stephanie Perkins wrote a fabulous story that kept me going from the beginning. I read this book on a long flight from San Diego to Dallas and finished on my home to Kansas City. I know that the people around me were wondering why I was laughing out loud while reading a book. My answer: It was funny!!<br /><br />What I liked: St.Clair. he was delectable and sweet and all around what I would dream about if I dreamed about n American English Parisian. The whole group of friends was such a good collection of diverse people. I think I could read a book about each of them.<br /><br />What I loved: I loved the beginning and the end. The middle was a little too repetitive for me and I waited in anticipation of how it would end. The end was perfect. I also loved Josh. I'm not sure why I was drawn to Josh, but I was. He rivaled St.Clair for the top spot. I've read around the blogosphere that the third book may include Josh. That would make me very very happy.<br /><br />Would I recommend: Absolutely. This book was raved about when frist released, and -admittedly- I was hesitant to read it. i was worried it wouldn't be enough to keep me going. I'm happy to say that it was. As with just about any book there are always things I'd like to see done a different way, but then that would probably change the book and it may not be as good.But YES YES YES I'd recommend this one.
B004FOA84A|1.0|actually reading a game badly because it's compatible with your phone is completely valid, not be compatible with 1 of the most popular smartphone on the market is a drawback therefore one star moron
0736092269|5.0|I've started to lift weights recently to get back in shape.  One of the difficulties I ran into was trying to determine which exercises targeted certain muscles.  In addition, I wasn't sure of the technique for certain exercises.  This book clearly answered my questions.                What is unique about his book is that it contains over 400 full-color illustrations of the human body performing various exercises.  The detailed artwork shows all the muscles used during the exercise and how those muscles interact with surrounding joints and skeletal structures.  So if you wonder, for example, what different muscles might be worked by a back lat pull-down as opposed to a regular one done in front, this book has clear drawings and explanations that show you.                In addition to over 115 detailed exercises for all parts of the body, the book helps you avoid injuries with an anatomical analysis of some common problem areas and helpful preventive measures to keep you healthy.  So if you've ever wondered just what muscles you're working when you do that barbell curl, bench press, push up, squat or dumbbell lunge, pick up this wonderful book.  I highly recommend it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes when opening, can't even play..even cleared cache, didnt work. Would like to at least TRY to play when it takes 16 mb! Droid x
B003ES61EE|3.0|Great for your small lenses such as the ones on your point-and-shoot camera or iPhone. Probably not as helpful on DSLR's or SLR's (use a microfiber cleaning cloth and blower in those cases).<br /><br />PRO's<br />- Convenient cleaning in a pinch.<br />- Works nicely for cleaning viewfinders, iPhone cameras, and the non-moving, built-in lenses in some Point-and-Shoot cameras.<br />- Both the brush end and the disc end are protected during transport by a retractable lever or cap<br /><br />CON's<br />- No instructions<br />- Excessive package. The \\"frustration free\\" package is easy to open. It is a large, flat cardboard box. But it is literally a dozen times larger than it should be.<br />- As with other lens pen cleaners, it does not have a puffer to blow away dirt.<br />- Some smudges don't come off easily
B004SBX112|5.0|I was wondering when the Easter update will be available for the HTC EVO? I really want to play. it states released yesterday. thank you very much. I love angry birds
B0012GMW34|2.0|At this time, both guitarists were under the sway of an guru--to the degree that they brought photographs of him on stage while playing and sported buttons with his blissed-out face on their apparel (see McLaughlin's right label on the cover photo). This accounts for the mindless and repetitive chanting that mars much of the recording.<br /><br />Despite this, the cast of musicians is stellar, a mixture of jazz and rock performers. The innovative Larry Young appears on organ, but is given little space to display his virtuosity. Sadly, he died young in 1978. The muscular and speedy Billy Cobham, from Mahavishnu Orchestra, is one of the drummers. As to Santana and McLaughlin, it is a rather odd pairing of talent. While Santana was influenced by jazz at this time, he is really no more than a blues, rock player with a Latin feel. McLaughlin, on the other hand, was more steeped in jazz, even as he moved toward rock. Thus, he is a better improviser and has a broader palette to dip into. Santana could even approach the kind of music McLaughlin is now playing, nor could he have jammed with The Mahavishnu Orchestra. The music was too complex and demanding.<br /><br />This effort is quite mixed. Some longer pieces drone on and on, while interspersed with inspiring moments here and there. The exception is the acoustic guitar duo, \\"Naima,\\" by John Coltrane, which is executed aptly and without fluff or noodling.
0756404738|5.0|Honestly from the moment I read Name of the Wind I was ready for Wise Man's Fear.  Now that it's here and I've devoured it whole I have to say I was not disappointed in the least.  Kvothe's story is continued in epic fashion by Rothfuss.<br /><br />From his continued education at The University, to his sexual awakening by a mythical being, and beyond you'll hang on every stroke of Rothfuss' pen.  The only criticism I can give is that it ended, and now I have to wait possibly two or more years to read the third book.  If you're on the fence about this book get off it and buy it now.  If you love masterful works of fantasy on par with Lord of the Rings go get both of these books now, and that concludes my ringing endorsement of Wise Man's Fear.
1844137872|5.0|If you're checking out this book, there's a good chance that you're already a fan of Banksy's or you've at least seen his artwork. So, I offer another reason for you to buy \\"Wall and Peace,\\" especially if you're not enough of a fan of his artwork to buy it on that alone.<br /><br />Quite simply, the man is funny. His art blends humor with social commentary; however, the book is peppered with written text containing subtle and not-so-subtle comedic gems. Here are a couple of short examples:<br /><br />The copyright for the book is entitled, \\"Copyright is for losers.\\" This is the opening line, \\"I'm going to speak my mind, so this won't take very long.\\" And my personal favorite is a quote from someone identified only as a Metropolitan Police spokesperson on the back cover which states, \\"There's no way you're going to get a quote from us to use on your book cover.\\"
B004FOA84A|1.0|Droid. App would force close every time I attempted to open. Even if it worked, its a 16MB install with no option to move it to your SD card. Glad I only tried it while it was free!
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|The Tourist did not fare well with the critics despite having Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp as the film's leading actors.  Jolie plays Elise, a beautiful mysterious English woman.  Depp plays Frank, an aloof American tourist.  As the film opens we quickly learn that Elise is being followed in hopes that she will lead investigators to her former lover Alexander Pearce.  The film has a few twists and turns, but it is described by its director as \\"a travel romance with thriller elements.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed it.  It isn't like the usual big buck American blockbusters, but that is what I enjoyed about it.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Didn't have crashing problems on my EVO as some reported.  It was fun to play.  I solved it in well under 30 minutes. I've played free trial versions of these kinds of games that had more to them. And they were FREE! I would not have been happy to buy this and had it completed so soon...even for 99 cents!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love anything with zombies (Thats doesnt exactly mean that their good) but when I heard that there was series about zombies coming on \\"AMC\\", I couldnt wait.  But I did because I didnt recieve the \\"AMC\\" channel, so I forgot about it and one day it randomly popped up on my side scroll on Amazon.  Long story short, I recieved the complete season and spent 6 hours watching back to back episodes on my day off and it was awesome. Its starts off kinda like \\"28 Days Later\\"  the whole waking up in the hospital thing without a definite reason of whats going on.  This Series had people that I recongized from other shows and movies, the make-up on the zombies were pretty impressive, acting believeable, CGI was on point give or take few city shots, on bad thing I have to say about this, is that the show doesnt comeback til October.....   Son of a Whore!!!!!!
B004SBX112|1.0|I see from the other reviewers that they have received an update. I have NOT...I'm beginning to regret using the Amazon Appmarket...this game has been out all week and I can't even update it. I keep going into the \\"My Apps\\" Section and there is NO UPDATE under \\"Update Available.\\" This is RIDICULOUS, I paid for this app, I should receive an update. I'll be deleting the Amazon Appmarket completely if this isn't corrected soon.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Immediate force close on gtablet. An old problem may have been fixed for xoom, but it didn't fix for all tablets. And now to waste words for Amazon's stupid minimum word limit.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Never having seen a Starz series before, I had no idea what to expect. This show did not disappoint. It is complex storyteling superbly acted. One of the best I've seen in awhile.
B004FOA84A|5.0|When I first saw this game available for download I was skeptical, since lots of games out there are garbage. But since it was a free download of the day, I decided to give it a try. To say the least, I was thoroughly impressed!!!!!!! I am a fan of the old school Shadowgate and UNINVITED games on nintendo, and this game is just like those!!! Sure enough, I was stumped about 10 minutes into the game lol. So if games like the ones I just mentioned or even Myst, this game will definitely hold you down!!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|There was an update for this app today and they appear to have fixed the Force Close issue that was plaguing the Xoom and the Evo (and possibly other devices).  I am revising my review from 1 star to 4.<br /><br />The game is a point-and-click style adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or Maniac Mansion.  You explore the manor, picking up assorted objects and clues to solve various puzzles.  These puzzles can open new rooms or provide pieces to still other puzzles.<br /><br />The game took me about 1 hour to finish, though this sort of game is old-hat for me.  Some of the puzzles were quite difficult, particularly figuring out the proper color sequence (if you play the game, you'll know what I mean).  Unfortunately, the game doesn't appear to have much replayability, since the puzzles are always the same.<br /><br />Is the game worth $1.99?  I'm not sure.  I got an hour's worth of brain-wracking enjoyment out of it.  That's slightly more per hour than a DVD rental, but cheaper than theatre or movie tickets.<br /><br />Old review:<br /><br />1 star<br /><br />Force closes immediately on my Motorola Xoom. And from reading other reviews, it appears the Xoom isn't the only device having this issue. Glad it was free.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Had a great story line, good action, even a romance.  Really a well rounded movie for everyone.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Wont run on moto Atrix.   The app had decent reviews until it went free.   Would have really liked to have played this game.  I look forward to the Dev fixing this problem.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It was alright,  although a Tad bit short for the amount of work put into it (assuming this based on the lack of bugs and excellent  graphics)
B004FOA84A|2.0|Fun game so far. Haven't solved globe yet. Bug at the stairs that teleports you to the truck in the attic when you touch the key hole.<br />Force closed when I put phone to sleep during gameplay. Tried to continue playing and that's when it force closed.<br /><br />Samsung Fascinate 2.2 (yay!)
B004FOA84A|2.0|Was shocked to see how easy it was to complete the game.  Really wish that it was much longer and would have wasted more than 5 minutes.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I've only had this for a few days and its been very useful. I bought this mostly for the serrated edge sharpener. Which works pretty good. Overall its light, small, could even fit in a wallet and works pretty good. Quality could be a little better but non the less it works just fine and the fine/rough portion can be replaced should they dull overtime. This is a must for anyone into pocket knives and defiantly in a survival kit, with the small size and good function this would come in handy in should a knife need a better edge.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app force closes every time I try to open it. I'm on a motorola atrix running the latest software. Twenty five words is stupid.
B001FB4W16|5.0|How I love this show! How I love the books! Great adult/older teen TV show, but I do suggest adult for the subject matter can get very HOT. Wonderfully written with a great cast! If you have not watched True Blood you need to for it is one of the best shows HBO has put out in a long time!
B004SBX112|5.0|Once I start, it's so hard to stop playing this game. It's as good as the other Angry Birds out there (original and Rio). The latest update is tons of fun and EXTREMELY challenging compared to some of the earlier ones. Keeps me entertained in boring meetings too.
0312370849|1.0|With an amazing historical story to tell, the author manages to wear the reader down with a contemporary soap opera that is not worthy of the original tragic history. I found the book a bit schizophrenic and the attempt to weave the tragedy of history with the melodrama of today simply a failure. Additionally, the writing is simplistic and banal at times, Ms. de Rosnay could have used a good editor to eradicate the bathos of the modern day tale. The only strong point of the book is that is does address the French complacency and collusion in the rounding up of France's Jewish population. So much more could have been done with a more competent telling of this tragic episode in French history.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Wish I could play it. Force closes every time. droid incredible. PS honestly amazon a 25 word minimum for reviews forces people to babble like I'm doing right now.
0375413405|5.0|Got this cookbook for my wife as part of an birthday present. She loves Julia Child's and had wanted her cookbook's for a long time. They did not dissapoint. The book does a great job of simplifiying Frech recipes and making it easy to execute. Everything she has made thus far has been a success. Overall great cookbook:)
0061134007|5.0|Joe Nesbo, The Redbreast  This is the first novel by Nesbo that I have read and I was not disappointed.  The plot is intriguing and complex but not confusing. The changes in background and time frame keep the reader guessing about who is taking revenge upon whom.  I very much like the detail about places, the view of the Eastern Front from the fighter's point of view, and the stories within stories. I am looking forward to reading another of his novels.
B004SBX112|5.0|got it for free and now updated. thanks Amazon. Great game and as free. Easter update was delayed but no biggie.  Works well in my HTC ThunderBolt
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game was pretty nice. I do like games of this type, reminds me of the days of Myst and Riven. It is a bit short, and some of the puzzles are kind of obvious, but it also doesn't require a notebook or make you pull your hair out like Myst did. It is a good game for phones, you don't ever feel like you have to keep going at any point, and it resumes right where you left off when you quit.    The Puzzles: like I said above, they are usually fairly obvious (not always a bad thing), while others make you scratch your head a little. I did have a few times where I found the \\"key\\" to the puzzle before I found the actual puzzle, but that didn't diminish the enjoyment of said puzzles.    The Length: those reviewers who said it is too short are probably hoping for a huge 40 hour head scratcher on a mobile platform. You won't get something like that on your phone without some huge install and it'd probably cost a pretty penny too. Coming up with a plot and puzzles isn't easy! That being said, this game will probably take up a good chunk of an afternoon for an average user, especially with breaks when you get stuck.    Some Issues: I did have one force close when I was fiddling with my hardware volume buttons while the game was loading, but that was it. The in-game volume slider only seems to affect the volume while you are in the options menu, it went back when I went back to the game. I ended up using the hardware volume to control it. That may or may not be a bug, but it is worth mentioning. One other thing is the lack of App2SD like others have said. The game isn't huge, but there are many phones out there (like mine) that don't have a heap of internal memory to spare. Due to this, I uninstalled when I was done to reclaim the memory.    Bottom Line: the game is fun, but don't expect something that'll keep you occupied for weeks; a couple of hours is a safe bet. If you like the point and click adventure type games (like Myst), this one is worth a try (especially if you grab it while it's Amazon's free paid app of the day).    EDIT: I should mention I am using a myTouch 3G Slide with Android 2.2.3 (Froyo)
B004SBX112|1.0|Ever since the easter egg update it will not run on my Xoom.  When I try to open it it imediatly crashes.  Please fix this update or roll it back to the older working version.

B003274QH6|5.0|the quality of the video on the blu-ray edition is pretty good overall but this show stands on it's quality regardless of HD or standard def.  Bryan Cranston's acting is second to none and once you watch a single episode it's hard to stop.  i'm counting the days till the release of season 3 and the start of the 4th season.

B004G6009U|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time! The quality of production is excellent, and the plot and characters are delightful.

B004FOA84A|3.0|This game was really fun. I was disappointed at how quick it was over though. It would be nice if this game was longer. It forced closed on me a couple times. I'm glad this game was free. I wouldn't bother spending money on it.
B00000K19E|5.0|Great movie. Instant classic.  Bought it to replace one I lost - promptly found it a day after the new one arrived.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closed from the moment I installed it. Too bad. I was hoping for a decent game. I guess that's why it's free though. Sausages.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I really enjoyed this. Completed it in about an hour or so but would have been quicker if the falcons had been easier to figure out. Well worth the download. I hope there's a sequel at some point.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Good action Blu-ray DVD. Item arrived a few days after order placed. Item packed well and arrived with no damage. This DVD is engineered well and plays well on 7.1 Surround system.
1433502410|5.0|There is so much to say about this study bible. There seems to be endless amount of notes on biblical passages as well as the historical background of the different books of the bible. There is even explanation of the translation in the beginning. There are many other things that i havent even mentioned, but it is an awesome study bible with good commentaries.
B004FOA84A|4.0|If you like puzzle/adventure games, this is an entertaining one.  There were a couple puzzles that stumped me for a little while, but I was able to beat the whole game within a couple hours on my own without using any guides or walkthroughs.  The graphics looked great.  I'm deducting a star because I thought it was too short, and also the volume controls don't work.  The control works in the menu itself, but once you exit the menu and go back to the game, the music starts playing again.  Hopefully they'll make a patch to fix this soon.  I wouldn't mind trying a sequel out if they make one.  Overall great free app of the day, albeit no replay value.  Still entertaining for a couple hours.  I did get a couple force close errors when my Droid X went to sleep and I woke it up/unlocked it again.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes on my xoom on startup and had to uninstall. Maybe I will try again if it gets a update to fix this issue.
B004P9FAK2|5.0|This is a very good movie and a good product despite the lack of extended version.  Excellent special features.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 25th Anniversary Concert we viewed on Public Broadcasting TV.  Had to order the DVD.  How wonderful!  Was not disapointed.  Absolutely raises the hair on your skin!    We clapped at everything!  One of the best ever.  Only one drawback - Nick Jonas.  I'm sure 100+ more artists could have done a better job.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|If you are looking for a life changing view at war and at the WWII, bone chilling never before seen footage and absolutely unbelievable stories told by those who lived through the toughest and the bloodiest years in the history of man kind, this is the documentary for you. I'm a HUGE WWII buff (i've seen hundreds of WWII documentaries) and i believe every person on the planest should be interested in this part of our history, to be educated enough so these horrors don't ever happen again. In this documentary u'll find yourself asking \\"how is this person still alive to tell their story right now?!\\" and if u have anything more than a stone in your chest, u'll find yourself shredding a tear or two as well.  Overall, please buy this documentary, it's EYE OPENING, BONE CHILLING, REAL, TOUCHING, UNBELIEVABLE... told by those who experienced the war first hand only 30 years after it was over, so it's very emotional for them and for you and the stories didn't have time to be changed by person to person telling...  THIS IS AS GOOD AND AS REAL AS IT GETS  100*
B000SEFNMS|4.0|This was a great book to read.  I hadn't been too much into reading for several years, but it was a very interesting read.  The plot line was easy to follow and the insertion of actual letters that were written really brought the story to life.  It was a much better book than the movie (which I really liked as well).  Definitely worth buying.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Game is pretty easy, I finished it in 30 min. wish it had more challenging clues and puzzles. would consider purchasing add on packs if they existed
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was by far the most exciting novel that I have ever read. Suzanne Collins has a gift and I would love to read more of her books.
B004FOA84A|4.0|the game was fun, but im glad i didn't pay for it. it only took me couple of hours of on &amp; off playing.  though to be fair- i did get stumped enough that i had to google for hints! entertaining game!
B003NVMYSY|4.0|This sci-fi show is about a covert group of individuals who investigate and deal with various incidents involving various beings that enter our world through an ever-widening rift in and around Cardiff, Wales.  The head of the group--called Torchwood--is one Captain Jack Harkness who, we discover in the first episode, cannot die for reasons as yet unexplained.  He is the only American; the others are British.  The group quickly enlists the help of a female police officer who is suspicious about Torchwood's carte blanche authority with certain crime scenes.  Definitely has an \\"X Files\\" meets \\"Outer Limits\\" meets Britain feel and appeal.  Enjoyable, yet probably not something for children (American, anyway) below the age of sixteen because the show has the occasional nude scene, \\"F\\" bomb, etc.  That's British TV for you.  I like the fact that it takes place in Cardiff rather than in the usual pedestrian places such as New York, London or Los Angeles.  Worth a look.<br /><br />Note: Captain Jack looks like a cross between Mark Harmon and Tom Cruise.
B0002EXH54|5.0|A clarion battle-cry, PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING is a THE how-to primer in the art of thrash metal. Released in 1986, PEACE SELLS' dazzlingly intricate and jazz-infused instrumentations were the polar-opposite of the glam metal explosion which had splashed it's purple lipstick across the face of metal in the mid-80's and remain a potent and timeless reminder of Thrash Metal's Golden Age.      MEGADETH'S debut album on major label Capitol Records, PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING was released at the tail-end of 1986 and represented the official launching pad for Dave Mustaine's trademark acidity-laced lyrical stylings and the superlative musicianship which would quickly become synonymous with MEGADETH. Opener \\"Wake Up Dead\\" storms the gates and unleashes an unholy barrage of battering drums and buzzsaw guitars as a growling Mustaine snarls \\"I know if I wake her/ I'll wake up DEAD!\\" A skull-crushing riff - and an INSANE middle-section custom-made for headbanging - elevate \\"DEAD\\" from mere album opener to a searing declaration of all-out Thrash Metal WAR!     \\"The Conjouring\\" is a chilling ode to the black arts replete with unnerving devil- summonings, burning candles and lashes from an acursed-cat's eye. \\"The Conjouring\\" effectively creates a dark mood which allows the band to expand and explore with some unique arrangements and musical ideas. A speedy riff and some fleet-fingered soloing from Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland add to the overall complexity of the  track and make \\"The Conjouring\\" one of the albums stand-outs.     The epic and band-defining title track seethes and expels black clouds of ominence  is next and is introduced to the massed via the throbbing, iconic bass-line of Dave Ellefson which introduces the title-track to the masses is  measured and assured an dpaves teh way for the      TO BE CONTINUED    a lyrical canvas such as this  iconic cover artwork                          that would soon become renowned the world-over as Dave Mustaine's      spits with unmatched virtriol      MEGADETH, SLAYER, METALLICA and east-coast mates ANTHRAX were busy perfecting  concocting the ingredients would would combust to form the infantile seeds of thrash metal ./ were spearheading a ferocious sub-genre of metal which was about to go nuclear and inflict a seismic shift      al;   collection of songs were intricate, jazz-inspired s a seismic shift in people's attitudes nad  at the SLAYER's REIGN IN BLOOD and METALLICA'S MASTER OF PUPPETS represented a seismic shift in the future of Dave Mustaine and company's brilliant battle-cry, PEACE SELLS....BUT WHO'S BUYING is a flashpoint for all things thrash and signaled the arrival of one of the genre's leading voices.     Three-years removed from being uncerimoniously excused from METALLICA and released on the heels their debut Combat LP KILLING IS MY BUSINESS...AND BUSINESS IS GOOD, PEACE SELLS found MEGADETH at the found themselves in the formidable position of being an outfit which had and with thrash metal the dominant musical forc of the time saw them snapped-up by thrash-eager major labels.     PEACE SELLS was MEGADETH's debut on in 1986 through Capitol Records. An album engulfed with rage and shattered emotions, Mustaine has a lot to prove and excessive personal demons
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|hadnt watched this movie in may years and it was good to watch it again this time with my teenaged daughter who loved it
0393338827|5.0|I dont read books, really I dont but I got on a book reading kick for some reason and I picked this up. I finished this book in a day and a half! Thats crazy for me, well I really enjoyed it.     This book told the story of the Wall ST \\"collapse\\" in a way that made sense to me, yes it had some jargony language in it but you cannot tell this story without it.     Great book, must read if you like financial titles.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Saw this featured on Oprah a couple of years ago, and after finally getting a Blu Ray player, this was my first Blu Ray disk purchase.  A truly awe-inspiring series with time-lapse photography that apparently took years to complete.  Fascinating series, and fantastic to have on in the background at a party.  Highly recommended.
B004FOA84A|4.0|If you seem to be having issues, it may be your phone. They say that any Android is a good Android, but they say a lot of things. Much like anything else, if you buy something cheap, it will work like something cheap. Also, people need to learn their phones. no matter what anyone tells you, they don't REALLY think for you. Anyway, this works great on the Samsung Fascinate, and even if it didn't, I'm not the type to complain about something free. People today.....I swear. LOL
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I can't say enough good about this knife. I used it as an axe on my last camping trip and it's still sharp after cutting up semi-wet wood in the mountains of Oregon. Incredible price for a knife that will stand the test of time.
B003ITDN86|5.0|I was waiting for this album for a long time, deryck's voice is so much better in this album, i also like that they have a slow part in almost every song, with some good instruments. All in all i am loving this new album! i just can't just stop listening to it! My favourites: Jessica Kill, Reason To Believe, What Am I To Say. But all the songs are just so good! ALBUM RECOMENDED FROM AN OLD SUM 41 FAN!
B0000026CM|5.0|I've loved Toto for many years. Playing around on Youtube recently I \\"discovered\\" a few songs I didn't know. I saw those songs on this album and bought it immediately. The anticipation was not as good as the music itself. I loved it instantly! It's always a joy to find music by your favorite artists that you never knew existed. You know ; you buy some of their music and then miss out on great obscure stuff. Well,  this is the good stuff.
B002VGR36A|4.0|This is an upgraded version of the original 1987 album Among the Living. This was the long waited breaktrough album for Anthrax. Has many classics we know and love and the bonus material is nice touch. The remastering is also quite good. Hopefully a sign of things to come for future re-releases. Get this album!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, liberty 2.01)<br /><br />I'll review evernote itself, and then review the alternatives...<br /><br />Evernote Pros:<br />This is a great app, for a service that has been around for awhile. It works well, and the combination of this with the premium service is, well, powerful. I think it's clear at this point that evernote is a solid piece of software, making a lot of peoples lives easier. The searching capabilities, sharing, and ocr push it to the next level. The UI is simple to use, and it really i seasy to figure everything out.<br /><br />Evernote Cons:<br />It has a pretty large install size for a note taking app, amazons version is way bigger than straight off the android market. And the terms of service, if actually read, would turn a lot of people off. The premium services are nice, but I don't know many who can justify $50 a year on them.<br /><br />SPRINGPAD vs EVERNOTE vs CATCH:<br />That's right, evernote is not the only one at this block-party. It's been around so long, and well marketed, that I think services like springpad and catch are still in the midst of trying to get peoples attention. They all do basic note taking and organization well. I think most people would be satisfied with any of these services. It really might take you trying each, to find the one you like the most. Id like to urge people to try these other services, as I really do like springpad better than evernote. Catch has a pretty plain ui as well, and does work well, but it wasn't for me. If the premium services for evernote weren't $50/year it would be a no-brainer. But the fact of the matter is that they are. And for us, amateurs ;)...Who refuse to drop that kind of dough on something like evernote. The playing field becomes completely level...<br /><br />Springpad's website has been great, easy to use..very customizable, and a lot of options. I was already in love with this service, then out of no where the company released a ground-breaking ui overhaul, especially concerning the springpad mobile app. It's amazing now, looks exactly like what appears on the website. Works extremely well, smooth, auto-syncing..and easy to share to and from it. The widgets in my opinion are better than evernotes, and i enjoy using this application a lot more as well. It has everything i'd ever want, Springpad ftw.. It's amazing now, looks exactly like what appears on the website. Works extremely well, smooth, auto-syncing..and easy to share to and from it.

B004FOA84A|5.0|I thought it was a great game, it works perfectly on my Evo. I do wish it was a little bit longer...but I certainly can't complain because it was free. There should be more games like this one.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Phone: Droid X (Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.01)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Game looks good, and worked well for me. Some of the puzzles were simple but fun. Although this isn't my favorite kind of game, it's still a bit nostalgic and refreshing to play the classic puzzle/adventure style game. They did a decent job with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Story wasn't all that impressive, and usually that's what really sells this genre of game(i.e. it's no 7th guest). Game is pretty short as well. And with most games like this, i generally throw away strategy and logic and just start clicking places until something new happens, thus ruining the game for myself lol. Not the games fault, just not 'my thing'. 3 stars is purely based on game though.. and a slight lack of compelling story elements and being short made what could of been a decent game, just ok.<br /><br />Should you buy? Worth grabbing today to play through. I wouldn't personally drop a dollar on this, i like a little more action than a game of this caliber is willing to provide, and the puzzles here are nothing to brag about. But for the people who love this adventure/puzzle style game, it's worth a play through.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Dell Streak7 -- force close immediately after launch. I tried turning the machine completely off, still won't work. I tried uninstall and re-install, still unexpected program stop.  Uninstall permanently.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was a quick game but i played through the whole thing so it must have been good enough. I like these puzzle type games but they have no replay value unless you have the memory of a goldfish.
B004FOA84A|4.0|As others have mentioned I also had force close with first launch. I cleared data; used task killer to free memory and it worked just fine. Nice graphics. It does play a lot like Myst so I personally am enjoying it. Many of the puzzles are very simple, but for free I'm not going to complain.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey had me laughing so hard on the subway... people were turning around and staring at me like I was a crazy person. Any fan of 30 Rock will be an instant fan of this book. So witty, engaging, and often full of insight into the industry, feminism, and life.
B004S699LI|2.0|Miserable Blu Ray release of a great movie. The picture is cropped from its original aspect ratio, the sound is sub-par, and the picture quality is all over the map. There are moments when the picture is stellar, especially during the beginning moments of the film in the outdoors. Colors pop and the picture is crisp and clear, but then it will suddenly change to something comparable to VHS.     Extras? Forget it! Nothing...zero...zilch.    It's a shame that one of Miramax's best titles wound up in the hands of this company, who produced such a horribly shoddy transfer of this film. Skip it and stick with your DVD.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I had a lot of fun with this game and its puzzles...while they lasted. I did have to think about some of the challenges, but it would also be appropriate for an older child.  However, the game was so short it almost seemed more like a demo than a full game. I would've been very disappointed if I'd paid for the app instead of getting it when Amazon featured it for free.  If it was expanded, I'd happily increase my rating.
0345509617|5.0|My boyfriend is the true Star Wars fan. I've only seen the movies a few times and I'm not a huge \\"cult fan\\" but it was fascinating none the less. Defintely a reccommended book for any enthusiast.. Makes a great coffee table book that guests will surely take a peek at!
0240815807|5.0|This book is a fantastic resource that I expect will dramatically improve my mixing abilities.  What more could you ask for than that?    I've now read the book from cover to cover.  I plan to read it a second time, working through each chapter's lessons, and then I'm sure it will become a fairly constant reference in my studio after that.    I don't think the book is necessarily for everyone, which works out great for people like me.  I think a complete novice would probably struggle with this dense book, while a pro can write their own (though I suspect that they would still learn from this book, just as the author - and his readers - profit by his many interviews with top mixing engineers).  But if you're situated somewhere in-between rookie and pro, this book is pitched perfectly for your needs.  That's me, and I've read a lot of books on the subject, but none this good.    What I most appreciate about the book is that it is strategic, methodical, rigorous, and straightforward.    By strategic, I mean that the author has a vision to which all the advice of the book is oriented:  producing commercial grade audio mixes.  Yes, there are lots of tactical tips sprinkled throughout the text, and they're quite helpful, but these are always in service to the greater goal.  This is not a 'mixing tips' book, per se - it's something much better than that, a mixing strategy book.    The book is also very methodical in its approach.  The author walks you through the process from beginning to end, explaining what is important and what is less so, showing how each step needs to build on prior work, and helping readers understand why his procedural order makes more sense than whatever method (or none at all) people might be employing on their own.    The author's approach is rigorous as well.  Mike Senior clearly takes the art and science of mixing seriously, and he encourages his readers to do the same.  He doesn't pull punches in telling us the scale of effort required to mixat the level to which he's trying to get his readers.  I appreciated those benchmarks.  They help give me a sense of what is required, and inspire me to go the extra distance in order to get there.    Finally, the book is straightforward in the sense that Mr. Senior seems to be free of faddish biases or particular hardware/software fetishes.  He's not selling anything other than better mixes.  He is simply devoted to telling his readers what works.    And, as an extra added bonus, he does so with humor.  And some days, when it's just you and that recalcitrant song mix punching each other silly in the arena, you need that!    But here's the most amazing thing of all.  Mike includes his email address in the book.  So I thought, what the heck, and I emailed him some questions.  He responded promptly and thoroughly.  That's really amazing.  It's like having a company provide great customer support for their complicated product - only it's not hardware or software, it's a book!  His willingness to support those of us in the field (see his website, Cambridge Music Technology) demonstrates a real love for the art itself combined with a rare generosity of spirit.  Massive kudos for that!    In short, here's the bottom line:  If much improved mixing is your aspiration, and if you're serious about it, buy this book pronto.
B004FOA84A|1.0|will not work on the leaked gingerbread release for the DROID x. will wait to see if update fixes the problem. I will rate again when its fixed.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Short game, designed for children, was able to complete in about 15 minutes. Nifty concept, but kind of lackluster story. Got for free on app store today. Worth the dollar but not more. Uninstalled do to lack of point to replay
0199535574|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Jane Austen\\"s \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" tells the story of the Dashwood Sisters, Marianne and Elinor, imbuing the siblings with  respective liberal and conservative worldviews.  The book is at its absolute strongest delivering illuminating commentary that, in some ways, validates the viewpoints of each sister.<br /><br />The sisters are introduced into society, receiving visits from chiefly the courtly but shy Edward Ferrars, the mysterious Willoughby, and the wise Colonel Brandon.  Each of these men reflect on the emotional lives of the sisters, mirroring hopes, potential loves, foolish anticipation and vanity.  In the two sisters, Ms. Austen creates a fantastic representation of competing and supportive sisterly, as well as sibling, complexity.<br /><br />A major complaint is that the book feels very creatively stifled, stifled in the lives of the women as well as in the events of true import in the story.  In some ways, it begins and ends in the drawing room, and never ventures much to other topics which would be more all-encompassing.  It's possible that Ms. Austen is making a sweeping societal statement about the proscribed lives of Englishwomen in her time.  However, the storytelling features cast a general slowness over the plotline that precludes much forward momentum.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Immediately force closes on Droid 2.  Won't even start.  After install, got the screen with the tree, then force close, but now it doesn't even get that far.  Open, black screen for 2 sec, then force close.
0446691437|3.0|Maybe this book didn't resonate with me as much as others because I don't have a major problem with The Resistance, as many do. I just get things out there: books, blog posts, videos, etc. But that's me. It's a little self-help and I would have appreciated a few more concrete steps and examples.
B003L20ID8|5.0|Here it is a romantic movie with, all the same, a thought about the Inanity of our Condition of Spirituals Creatures came down in the Material, and incapables of exercise our Free-Will, Divine present, wisely... Talking of which, Terence Stamp little speech is really delightful!    LOVE would-it be THE answer ?    That is already a reflection about CHOICE, THE choices we make (or think we make) everyday, and which commit ourselves in a short or long term.  Choice of Life, of way of Beeing, of Lover(so!); and above all, about the consequences of these choices (Domino effect) that we are supposed to take like a responsible adult.    Keeping the movie mind, Believer or not, which is, really, our room for manoeuvre, beetween Chance, Fate and Free-Will??    By the way, it's interesting that Matt's first name is David, a famous biblical character, who fought against Goliath, invincible giant, and defeated him, against all expectations...    Now, about the movie, everyone can question about the processing of the matter, script, directing, interpretation... In my point of view, the film would have been better if it has been rougher and more sensual; but I supposed it must be for general public!??  Personnally, like it is, I thought that pleasant!    But get down on Earth and let appreciate the show: Matt Damon, determined, rush around very much, a little bit of good shape from 'Jason Bourne' probably, but still remains credible and attractive, yes indeed(!), like a young, evolving and ambitious politician.    He make a touching couple with the 'cute-body' and charming Emily Blunt, a promising dancer in a striking and spicy girl! Emily worked hard: the modern ballet scenes are magnificent!  Their mutual scenes, all of them really successful, show a indisputable Chemistry between them.  They are the best of that movie, in my humble opinion...    Don't miss the first meeting, in the beginning...  It's really moving  to see them, touched and surprised by this unexpected 'Love at first Sight', and more than that, terrified and dazzled to recognize themselves like two Soul Mates...  Everyone's Dream, yes??    LOVE IS the answer!  Hallelujah!!!
B004FOA84A|1.0|i was so excited to find out this app was free because i wanted to try it. but as soon as i downloaded it my phone started freezing and when i opened the game it kept force closing and caused my phone to freeze.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Nice game.  I haven't had any problems with the game.  My daughter likes it as well, so it spans generations.  So far it is definately worth 99 cents.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Game works perfect on my LG Optimus V.  The only reason there are so many low reviews is because so many differances exist in manufactures use of android that it is nearly impossible to make games work petfect on each device.  This is the number one reason apple is winning the app war.  When will manufactures realize the huge downgrading mistake they are making by not unifying their use of android.  Until then androids game library will pale big time in comparison to apple.  Who wants to spend lots of time and money on something that has a high chance of tanking due to so many differant imcompatability issues.  Oh well I will still need to take my ipod touch everywhere and consider upgrading on the fall.
0670022411|3.0|Well, the story itself was interesting and well written, however as I was getting to the end and the story was just picking up, I realized--quite unhappily, I might add--that this was not a book that would stand on its own.  This is apparently the first in the All Souls Trilogy.  Again, the story itself is good, but this book is over 500 pages, and this is only the first in a trilogy.  I likely would not have gotten it if I had realized that, as I just finished the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning and I was not looking to start another series so soon after that.  The synopsis of the story does not give that impression at all.      Griping aside, the story is a good one, and very interesting with the sweeping history that is mentioned throughout.  I'm not a science person, but the way it was woven throughout the story was intriging as well.  I enjoyed most of the characters, especially Sophie.  She is brought in towards the end of The Discovery of Witches, and is a delightful character and full of promise.  I also loved Marthe, mother hen that she is.  I'm unsure when the next installment will come out, so I'm not sure that I will go out of my way to buy it quickly unless I have nothing else to read at that time.  The story takes a bit to really grab hold of you, but is really interesting towards the end.  I would have given the story itself 4 stars, however I was not expecting a series, only a stand alone story, and I'm still a little disappointed by that.
B000002H5I|1.0|I was working at a record store when this album came out (back when they had record stores) and was forced to listen to this on our PA system on a daily basis. Musically lacking any ambition, chock full of really simple-minded, self-righteous lyrics, and about as interesting as a ten-pound bag of fertilizer.
B0013FSXT6|1.0|I love this film, but this blu ray is terrible!  I have standard definition DVD's with better picture quality!  The blu ray is the unrated version but if you have it on DVD just keep that!  There should be some sort of regulations on video quality on Blu ray and on DVD's because we never know what we might get.  A much better transfer is needed.
1582701709|3.0|I listened to the audiobook, on recommendation of a friend.  Don't take it too literally, and it is helpful and uplifting.  I think of it like the parable of the stone soup (a stranger comes into town and tells the villagers he can make soup out of a stone.  In order to flavor the soup, they offer him salt, vegetables, etc. . .)  If the Secret helps you to clarify what you want, focus your goals, and believe in the possibility of acheiving your goals, then chances are it will help  you acheive success. Just tune out the pseudoscience and crass materialism.

Condensed nuggets of important concepts, illustrated superbly, diagrammed and written first person by the artist, so very helpful for artists wishing to grasp animation and graphic novel illustration.

0307887960|4.0|I think there are some very good points to this diet.  You will lose weight, without a doubt.  And I truly believe that some of it will be fat...not just water and glycogen depleted from your muscles.  But, that being said, I think it will also create some other issues such as constipation and bad breath from the ketones.  I think a lot will depend on how much weight you have to lose and what you are willing to do to get there.  In an emergency get some weight off quick, this would be a good choice.  However, I really feel that for a lot of fat loss, and for long term, there are better programs out there that will teach you skills that you can maintain and provide fat loss while still enjoying a reasonably normal life.
B003UESJ9W|5.0|My name is Juan and I am writing from Spain. I purchased this blu-ray a few days ago, even though the product description read \\"region 1\\". That is completely wrong, again. I say \\"again\\" because I purchased \\"Morning Glory\\" a few weeks ago, even though that product description read \\"region 1\\" too. I was so pleasantly surprised when I got my movies and found that they are both region A, B, C, in other words, those movies will play anywhere in the world. As a matter of fact, another blu-ray is on its way. I purchased \\"Rabbit Hole\\" last Monday. I am sure it will be all region too. I do beg Amazon to provide the right information so we, customers, do not need to fret till we get the disc and see for ourselves whether or not it plays.<br />Anyway, this is a jewel of a movie. I cannot understand why our great and dear Gwyneth Paltrow would not get an Oscar nomination. I loved everything about this movie. The script, the acting, and of course, HER singing. Even if you do not like it all that much you will not be disappointed at all. You will, at least, have a good time.<br />Thank you for reading my review.......and again, please, Amazon, provide the correct information so that many customers like me will be thrilled to learn that they can buy movies that will play in their countries.

B000V7O0H6|4.0|All I want to say is I got what I asked for and the service was exemplary.  The film was all that I expected and Brandon Routh is as believable a Superman as was the first with Mr. Reeve.  I would like to think Christopher Reeve would look at this as a success and would be very pleased.  Also, Lex Luther is portrayer as a a really despicable super villain by Mr. Spacey.  All in all, I thought it was great movie.
B000000LZV|5.0|This album is probably a great place to start for music fans of eclectic tastes & open minds who appreciate the DIY aesthetic and music played with passion & sincerity.  If you've not dabbled into punk but want to sample a band both extremely influential but also much broader in musical scope than most punk bands (the allmusic.com guide goes into detail), then the Minutemen are not only a great starting point but this album is probably a pinnacle.<br /><br />Though I often have a soft spot in my heart for the fast, raw, distorted guitar frenzy of most 70s and 80s punk, this album is a refreshing departure in that there are pretty much no songs that fit that description.  Boon actually had the guitar skills to play lead like a true lead guitarist, with solos the way you're used to hearing them if you're a rock or jazz fan, played at a blistering pace (comparatively speaking).  Throw in the nods to Steely Dan & Creedence, add in the Nortena diversion of \\"Corona\\" (which has been used in numerous films), and not to mention the sense of humor of a band that releases songs called \\"Maybe Partying Will Help\\" or \\"The Roar of the Masses Could be Farts\\", and you've got a potent mix that will definitely make a lasting impression.<br /><br />I always include this album in the '5 albums on a desert island' list I get asked to outline in those late night, alcohol-inspired musical conversations.  Other recurring titles being Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" and the Rolling Stones' \\"Exile on Main Street\\".  And this album sounds nothing like those, it just has that much of an impact on me.

B00005K3O4|5.0|An invasion is happening - and taking on the form of Killer Klowns that have brought their Big Top from Outer Space!<br /><br />While a joke in some ways, the punch line to this movie is not that it is done badly or that it has some bad spot in it that can only be overcome by something like clowns with deadly balloon animals. to the contrary, the Killer Klowns are one of those movies that has a gimmick that really does work.<br /><br />I remember checking this out a long time ago, and I recall loving it. I also recall people hating this movie once upon a time as well, lumping it into what we would now call Scy-Fi Channel outpts, and everybody thinking that was that. Then this lovely little thing called DVD started spreading the word and humor, the strange thing that it is, started growing. Combine thta with magazines like Fangoria that had a hand on the pulse of horror and you could see the designs that were great, the weapons that were odd, and the ship that was really interesting. It wasn't just a movie with some clowns in it from the stars.<br /><br />I personally love the way the clowns here look and I love the way things work for them. Whether it is the aforementioned balloon animals or the way the clowns get this evil look to them, it all seems to work. There is this mix of The Blob and It and so many other movies here that mingle and make a great tale, and it is not just for one group. It also works on that fear people have of clowns, allowing them to truly be alien. And why not? Biological horrors = 5/5 in my book here.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
1936719010|2.0|With its frequent reference to the need for \\"huevos\\", \\"balls of iron\\" and the like, the book invokes an anger-driven, battle metaphor for creativity. Hence the book's profanity. The author comes by his metaphor honestly, since he's an ex-marine and current screenwriter, and war may be a good metaphor for how deals get done in Hollywood. But Hollywood's a dysfunctional culture and not a model to imitate, unless you want to succeed in L.A. For a more lengthy critique, read Nathanael West's \\"The Day of the Locust.\\"

0061914177|4.0|It's a short read. If you get what he's saying in here and really put it in action, you will eventually break through in whatever you're doing. It's all about the intensity of what you're doing. You can't spend two hours on the weekend trying to build a business. You have to spend every waking moment of every day, week after week working on your goals. I was trying to develop my website and build viewership. I was doing one really thorough long story a week and getting about 200 website hits a week. Not bad for a beginning site. I read this book and decided to post as many stories as possible on the website, and within a week I was getting 200 hits a day. I continued doing this and my hits doubled. Then doubled a couple more times. 200 hits an HOUR? No problem. And that was only after a few weeks. It could have taken me 3 years to develop the site to this level at the rate of one story per week. You need to be kicking up a lot of dust every single day for your efforts to add up, and for people to take notice. For me, it was worth its weight in gold. If you tend to make a lot of excuses, this book won't help you at all. [...]

B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Down through the years, I have listen rather erratically to the playing of Radu Lupu; however I  have always enjoyed his beautiful playing on his recordings.  However due to him being rather erratic in performing, his sublime artistry has slipped, somewhat, from my \\"listening horizons\\".  This \\"new\\" 10 disc set at a special price of $36.69 has reestablished my great admiration of Radu Lupu's pianism.  This Decca set features all of his solo recordings for Decca ranging from early and rather unknown, to me, Beethoven (i.e., Rondos Op 51) to some \\"major\\" and familiar works by Brahms (i.e., The two Rhapsodies, opus 79) and Schubert (i.e., 6  Moments Musicaux, D780) along with some finely played familiar Schumann (i.e., \\"Kinderszenen\\" and \\" Kreieriana\\")  Also included is a marvelous recording of Beethoven's 3rd piano concerto some Beethoven Sonatas \\"(Moonlight \\", \\" Pathetique\\" are included) along with  some Schubert sonatas.      I really enjoyed listening to this compilation. Lupu is such a splendid artist playing with very beautiful tone, flashes of virtuosic brilliance and deep feeling.   I am so very glad that I purchased this very fine \\"tribute\\" to a wonderful artist indeed because it has reestablished my admiration of a great pianist.

B004SC54BG|1.0|I purchased this album, and when it came to the section where I would download it, it /forced/ me to download a 'downloader'.  The problem is, my platform (Linux Ubuntu 10.10) wasn't covered (a version for 9 didn't work).  So I couldn't download the music.  Now, it appears that amazon won't let me download the music at all, and I just got rooked for $8.00.  I was not warned that I  was required to download this downloader, because I was always allowed to skip the downloader for individual songs.    Um, guys, how about a refund here?
B0034G4P7G|2.0|I am one of the few who thinks this movie is way overrated.  On the positive side, the direction by Fincher and the script by Sorkin do move along considering the movie is not really about anything but the creation of a website.  I did not like the movie but I was never bored by it.  Eisenberg and Timberlake were especially good.  My problem?  Every character was a greedy, Harvard snob.  I realize that you don't have to \\"root\\" for characters, but Zuckerberg is so repellent, it was difficult to get involved.  He treated others so poorly that it was really disappointing to see him become successful in the end (although obviously I knew that going in).  I really hated his character, and outside of being a computer genius, he did not have any redeeming or admirable qualities.  Again, good acting, but it was an exercise in bad people behaving badly.
B004LP601S|5.0|I was enthralled with Pretty Odd and was sad to see Ryan leave the band, but having heard the stuff he has put out since, I'm thoroughly glad that he had no influence on PATD's third record. This is a great album and I can't wait for the fourth.
B003ASKR2A|5.0|This is the first graphic novel I ever read (and I haven't read many since).  I thought it was very \\"dense\\" and that's what I admired most about it.  Once I finished, I began reading it again immediately.  There are parts that are better than others (Rorschach's backstory was great; Dr. Manhattan's not so much).  But it was really interesting and I liked all the stories going on simultaneously.  It was a bit confusing the first time around, but I've read it three times now and admired it and enjoyed it each time.  If you've never read a graphic novel, give this one a try.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|What a killer album!! This is their best album [other than \\"The Gathering\\"] since \\"The New Order.\\" They get back to their straight up thrash roots with Alex S. back with the band. Chuck's vocals are mostly clean other than the Title Track, which is one of their most brutal songs ever. I recommend this to any old school thrash fan, or any new kid getting into thrash. Both generations will be pleased..... And don't listen to this KOURKOULOS NIKOS reviewer. He's been bad mouthing all Testament albums. This is someone who rated high on Sepultura's \\"Roots\\" and Soulfly's \\"Primitive\\". This kid doesn't know anything...

1416589473|3.0|I'm a major fan of the original Guild Wars game, and an avid fiction reader currently studying the craft of writing fiction, in hopes to eventually write a few books of my own. After reading both GW2 novels, this first one took the characters from the different races and sterotyped them to the extreme, to where the characters were predictable and shallow. The events in Ascalon City at the end of the book were well written, giving a critical piece of the history that leads into GW2. The rest of the plot was fairly well structured. Overall I'd have to say this book was decent, but could have used more attention to make the characters more believable and likeable.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|When I read, I want brain candy. Not bad writing. Brain candy. Stories that are engaging, with well-wrought characters and elements of suspense that keep you guessing. The Discovery of Witches is an adult version of a Harry Potter-like story that's a great read. My only complaint was the amount of time the heroine seemed to be in bed recovering from some kind of illness or injury or energy expenditure receiving attention from her beau..once or twice ok, but every event?? If you like mystery novels and can't stand emotion-wrenching disfunctional families, this is a great book. I can't wait for the next one.

B003CI90MQ|5.0|I'm a fairly enthusiastic amateur photo taker and wanted to learn more about how everything actually works (rather then just pressing a button and being done with it).    This book opened up my eyes to a new world. Everything looks different when you start thinking not how something looks, but how its going to look through a camera.  With tips for every skill level and the complete range (from setup to postproduction) of topics presented, I can't see this book not being my go to reference as I get more into the hobby.    Well recommended and well written.

0061990477|4.0|A captivating story/saga of unfulfilled deep love through three generations of women.  The saga is balanced on the love story between Meggie Cleary and Father Ralph de Bricassart,  Father Bricassart's Love for Meggie is strong but his vows to the church and his professed Love of God is stronger. Meggie must cope with her deep devoted love for him and the hope that one day he might commit himself to her completely.  Their story forms the main theme of this powerful but difficult and unreconciled love.  This theme is advanced and varied in a wonderful story that spans 55 years.  Ms. McCullough's writing style was perfect in evoking images for the heart and the mind.  She paints this wonderful story through many of the events of the the 20th Century and describes a unique way of life in the Australian Outback.  I strongly recommend for all, especially for those who enjoy historical romances.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have read all the Harry Potter books and loved most of them.  I have not liked all the movies.  I think that in some movies important scenes were left out.  This one is the best one yet.  It differs some from the book but still retains what the book was about.  It had not seen that showed Neville being brave.  In the first book he was very afraid of most of everything.  He has changed with the help of Harry and his quest.  One seen from the book that I think they should had added more was when Ron returned and Ron and Hermione get into a little spat.  That scene was much better in the book.  You can see how unsure Harry is but he keeps trying.  Even when he learns some hurtful things he just keeps going.  His determination is unmatch by Tom Riddle.  I refuse to call him by the name he came up with.  It is not one he earned.  In this movie you see a side of Tom, the scared side.  He thought he was the best but now he knows he is not.  He faces a moment of self-doubt which he quickly overcomes.  I hated to see the end of this movie but I look forward to seeing Part II.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|With Scrubs being finished and The Office in its 7th season, I was needing something new.  I'm a sitcom fan.  Seinfeld, Friends, Simpsons, IT Crowd, The office, Scrubs, and now the Community all sit on my shelf.  I don't think its because the Community being newer is why I like it the best.  I think its because it takes a style from everything that has worked before it and incorporated into something a little diverse.      The overall synopsis has been tried a thousand times... An unlikely and diverse group is forced together and nothing is as it seems.  But they do so much more than try to revitalize a century old idea.      The large cast is at the top of their game.  They work well together and no one really steals the show (which I think is a very good thing).  While Jeff is billed as the 'leader' he very heavily relies on EVERYONE and their story.  At any time someone could be left out or someone, anyone could be focused on and it would work for a time.      The story remembers itself.  Each episode isn't a new 20 minutes that start from scratch.  If someone broke their leg last week they are in a cast or limping the following week.  Its not like the Simpsons where they draw in a door slot when its convenient or they themselves joke about how the plots rarely remember or explain major previous events.  Every episode adds to the community cannon that will be drawn upon in the future.      The characters are aware of the outside world.  They can joke about politics, companies, religions, hollywood, etc.  The show is set in a real world which adds a layer of depth and comedy that some shows will avoid.  While Scrubs was a great show, it knew very little of what happened outside the hospital.  They brought in guest stars.. but as doctors or patients, rarely, if ever as themselves.      Soap Opera writing.  Seinfeld and Scrubs are my favorite examples of soap opera sit coms.  Everyone's story is important and will eventually intersect.  The intersection usually creates a pretty big laugh.  With Seinfeld, they mastered bringing everyone together in very unique and deep ways.  They went outside the box to get events like a golf ball, a beached whale, and a white lie about being a marine biologist together for side splitting laughter.  Scrubs took this mechanic and used it as a way to tell a story and make a meaningful point.  Every episode had a lesson and it was often told by comparing the different cast members situation.  They could make you laugh and cry in the same episode.  The Community does both and in its first season, they do it like a pro.  They also go in other directions that many would think would turn the show upside down.  The gangster chicken strip episode, the paint ball war zone, and the zombie episode all find ways to do the outrageous without ever leaving context.     The DVD contains features throughout.  One episode has an extended version that can be seen or you can choose to watch the original.  Every single episode has commentary.  There are deleted scenes, bloopers,  and a mix of featurettes.  Even the DVD casing is setup like a year book and each of the characters has left writing and well wishes over the other characters pictures and episode titles.  I was not expecting much from a first season DVD, but it actually ended up delivering more extras then... well, just about everything out there.      We all have our own personal preferences, so its hard to really \\"RATE\\" a TV show.  But in this case, its quite easy for me to do.  This show gets an A+ in every possible category.  They put so much work into the set, the characters, the writing, the plot, the atmosphere, even the DVD cover, that I have to let them graduate with honors.      As with most shows, there is concern about how 8 different college students will still be together 4 years from now.  But the writers have proven clever enough, that I'm content to rest my fears and enjoy each episode they deliver.

B00006ZXSK|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, I really did, but it would have been better if I wasn't trying to figure out how Danielle could be considered a commoner when she's the daughter of a countess. We don't know for sure what rank her father was but it was evidently good enough for him to marry a very snooty and ambitious baroness, so he was almost certainly a nobleman. And if his first wife, Danielle's mother, was a countess he's likely to have been a count. Unless she was illegitimate, which was never suggested, Danielle would have been a noblewoman by birth and of equal rank to her stepsisters. Even if the mother wasn't really a countess, Danielle would certainly have been a gentlewoman, not a commoner. My feeling is that the Angelica Huston character's treatment of her would have been considered quite scandalous by the nobility. She and her fellow servants would most certainly have been aware of all this. Then add in the fact that the word 'courtier', which is used to describe Danielle, was used only for men - women were courtesans. (Granted, the female version has another meaning that wouldn't be appropriate for this movie.)  I guess all that is nitpicking, but it really bugged me and took quite a bit of entertainment value out of what's otherwise a very charming movie.

159562015X|5.0|I'm in my mid-30's and I have decided to go back to college for a general Business Administration degree.  But I've felt that being an EA just really isn't who/what I am or want to continue to be, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do that not only would I be good at but would be satisfying.  This book re-confirmed to me what my strengths were and based on that I now know what I want to do with my career and I can choose my college courses wisely.  I really don't understand why certain people are hung up on the fact that they only get their top 5 strengths.  Isn't that the whole point??  I certainly don't want to be inundated with all 34 strengths - I want to focus and strengthen my top five!    The point of the online questions only being available for 20 seconds is because they don't want you to spend too much time thinking about the answer because then it won't be accurate.  You spend less than $20 on this book - it's worth it.

014241543X|5.0|Wow...I'm still emotionally spent by this book, even after finishing it. Gayle Forman's beautifully written novel is gut-wrenching, and in a compact, gripping way unique to YA fiction today. Seventeen-year-old Mia's life is interrupted violently by a car accident. Her parents are dead, her brother is also injured seriously, and Mia must choose between returning to life or dying alongside her family. I don't want to say much here, so as not to give away the lovely story Forman tells. Absolutely recommended, especially if you have your tissues on hand!

B001P3OMY6|4.0|Jane Hayes, a 33-year-old graphic designer, is ashamed of one thing--her obsessive love for Pride and Prejudice...the BBC miniseries. With a fervent dream to step into the shoes of Elizabeth Bennett and find her own Mr. Darcy, Jane has had a string of failed relationships, many of which ended because of the man's lack of certain Darcy-esqueness. When her elderly great-aunt finds her DVDs of Pride and Prejudice hidden in her plant, Jane confesses everything--her inability to trust men, her secret desire to live in another era, and her dreams of the perfect man who's just as obsessed with romance and marriage as she is. Her aunt's last gift to her is a trip to a veritable \\"Austenland,\\" a manor called Pembrooke where actors dress up in Regency gear, modern electronics are not allowed, and women are expected to play whist, dance, and flirt with the \\"gentleman\\"--all with the intent of finding temporary satisfaction in presumed true love. Jane's adventure in Austenland is funny, romantic, and self-reflective. And yet, the question remains--will Jane find her own Mr. Darcy?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I first read George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones back in 1997, just after I graduated from college -- I had completed Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time (to that point), and was enticed by the Jordan blurb on the cover of the paperback. Combined with a fondness for George R.R. Martin's short stories and Wild Cards series as a teenager, I knew I should give it a chance. I remember being up late at my mother's house in the height of winter, feeling an odd chill as I finished the prologue, impressed by the mix of fantasy and horror. Of course, with its rich cast of characters, focus on politics, and subtle approach to magic, A Game of Thrones is much more than its prologue.<br /><br />In many ways, A Game of Thrones represents a tremendous paradigm shift in fantasy.  Characters are flawed, and central figures -- even protagonists -- can die horribly. We may take this for granted now, but in the late 1990's, fantasy was still largely wed to the Tolkien model. Not so after A Game of Thrones. Robert Jordan, David Eddings, Terry Brooks, et al, all seemed adolescent in comparison to Martin.<br /><br />I have since gone back and read it six times over the past 14 years -- whenever a firm date is announced for a new volume of a Song of Ice and Fire, I go back and re-read all the books in the series. The recent announcement of A Dance With Dragons for July 2011 is no different -- except this time, I'm reading the series on my Kindle and not in print. Fortunately, the typography and art translates well on the platform, and reading it on Kindle is very similar to reading it in print. Even knowing the story as well as I do, including through a recent screening of the first six episodes of the HBO television adaptation, I find there's still much to enjoy. The tragedy that befalls Ned Stark and his children is still as great as it was on first reading -- and the hindsight of the later books only helps to underline this.<br /><br />For many years, I have tried to find fantasy series that can compare, and though some come close, none have been able to match A Game of Thrones. And as good as the television series is, the source material is still better.  If you're still on the fence, you really have no excuse.  Read it. And don't complain about the Kindle price -- it's worth the $9.ugh some come close, none have been able to match A Game of Thrones.

0061726826|4.0|I really enjoyed Oliver's take on a futuristic America, where love is considered a disease. Like \\"Before I Fall,\\" her writing is beautiful and flows so easily. My only criticism is based on a deeper curiosity--I would have loved to know more about how American society came to be so against love (and really, any kind of emotion). Her teasers at the beginning of each chapter shed some light on the society, but not nearly enough (and it seems like there's the possibility for it to be so interesting)! Otherwise, I thought it was an excellent addition to the recent dystopic literature for teens.

I pre-ordered Born This Way two months ago.  One month to go - 5-23-11 - and the wait is killing me.  Gaga is an artiste extraordinaire.  There has never been anyone like her, and never will be again.  She is an Original, possibly several Originals.  She is a Master not just of music, but avant-garde music video, performance, fashion, presentation, possibly sex and sexuality, and yes, even Twitter.  And yet, in her interviews she seems so incredibly real and grounded and reachable.  Who is she?  She is a Goddess!!!  and I am her little monster!

Later I discovered that I had ordered this book from my book club as well! See I told you it took forever and ordering two didn't speed up the process either. Ha! (Was having a senior moment) I cannot express how much I love this book. It's definitely one of my FAV'S! In my book, Sherry Serafini is awesome! The tools and stitch instructions are complete, and Sherry has written thorough instructions for the projects in the book. She has included projects more aimed for the beginner to master beading projects. LOVE her designs!!! I would be super elated to wear or make any of her creations. She includes bling in her designs which is a beader after my heart. Just when I think I know her design \\"brand\\", she presents a new project that just blows me away! Like I said, Sherry is awesome! Go girl!
0385338082|5.0|This book was AMAZING! When I first got this book, I was kind of skeptical, I never read Sophie Kinsella's books before, and I never liked the Shopaholic Series. I first read a couple chapters and it was kind of boring, it started to get good when she meets Jack, the stranger on the plane. This book is full with humor and romance. This book is such a delight, definitely one of the best reads of my life.

B0049U4NQO|4.0|SPOILER ALERT    Well I guess that Scorpia Rising had a predictable yet very unpredictable ending. Jack's death came as a shock but the decision for Alex to be the Pleasure's son came across as weird. (Wouldn't that meen Alex and Sabina are brother and sister?)    Julius Grief was another shocker in the book and not a very pleasant one. His character lacked depth and his only purpose it seemed, was to torture Alex. Razim, on the other hand, was a great villain and had an entire chapter devoted to backstory. (and it wasn't even a monologue!)    The book was great. It was filled with more action scenes to sink a ship, but story wise, I think Horowitz could have had a less messy ending

B003UYV08E|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />As \\"Iron Man 2\\" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero.  But such a public admission comes with a steep price.  For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.<br /><br />As a piece of pure Saturday-matinee popcorn entertainment, \\"Iron Man 2,\\" directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor.  However, the sequel still has enough quality elements - most of them holdovers from the first film - to recommend seeing it:  namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some - though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances.  As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.<br /><br />The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition.  This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about.  And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.<br /><br />The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.rt, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|I have many versions of scrooge and of Christmas Carol, and they are all wonderful, including this one.  It's one of those movies that can cause you to think about how YOU are living, provided you give yourself permission to look within yourself, and make some vital changes in areas which you may not be living right in God's eyes as He sees what you're doing daily, weekly and so on. Very inspirational and ministering to the heart, mind and soul. I believe that is what Scrooge and Christmas Carol were created for to begin with.

Was disappointed with this cd/vid. for 2 reasons.1st the video is all from one show in japan. was hoping they had footage from all shows. 2nd the cd did not have any of the medly of zep, beatles.... that they played live which was very fun to see them do. So with no new songs, would rather stick with studio stuff.
B00001MXXH|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"Ferris Bueller\\" yet, you ought to do it soon! Ferris is a charming young man who skips school during senior year. It's not that his idea of ditching is ingenious; a lot of high school students take a random day off school, and ever since this movie's release in 1986, there have been dozens of movies and TV episodes where kids have played hooky. It's not even Ferris Bueller's first time skipping out on school--he tells the audience in the beginning that he's ditched class nine times already that year.<br /><br />What actually makes this movie \\"work\\" are the great balance of humor and seriousness: the principal trying to catch truants, the sister trying to get her brother in trouble, and a boy who wants to get more attention from his busy father. All these characters and others are portrayed comically, yet in such a way that you can still relate to their relationships. A lot of the comical elements in the movie were fairly new when this movie came out, and some have not been overused yet, making the humor in this movie pretty original.<br /><br />And of course there's more to the movie you're bound to like. You'll get a tour around some of the most prominent parts of Chicago, sit in an economics class taught by Ben Stein, and hear Ferris's perspective on everything, as he addresses the audience in an aside every once in a while.
031603438X|4.0|An engaging book that covers the highs and lows (pun intended) of Keith Richard's life from childhood to current events. While the middle section covering his junkie years feels a bit sordid, the rest of the book is an engrossing tale told in his unique voice.     The book starts off with a bang as he talks about his childhood which could have come from a Dickens novel - replete with beatings, poverty, sadistic schools, and grimy city streets, all told with nary a hint of self-pity. Other highlights in the book are whenever he delves deep into musical concepts. It's obvious how much he loves music, and it's fascinating to read about how he figured out guitar riffs, how he used feedback from a cassette recorder to come up with the sound for \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and other songs, and why he played with a five string guitar. He provides too much detail about his junkie years, slowing the book down, but things get interesting again in the 1980s and 90s section of the book. The book ends on an almost whimsical note as Richards talks about everything from Paul McCartney visits to cooking bangers (for which he includes a recipe).

B001OQCV6A|3.0|I thought \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" was a pretty good movie.  Granted, I have enjoyed several of the Basil Rathbone movies and found myself comparing the new version to the old ones.<br /><br />As for the old ones, I liked the eerie backgrounds that pervaded the movies.  I liked the newer version for more instances of comedy.<br /><br />The story in the new version was good:  a murderer who wants to take over the world feigns his own death and plots his takeover, starting with the British Parliament.<br /><br />While the movie was entertaining, I thought it lasted a few more minutes than necessary.  Perhaps around 1.5 - 1.75 hours instead of just over 2 hours.<br /><br />Thought Robert Downey Jr.  did a good job in the Holmes role.  Jude Law was okay as Dr. Watson.<br /><br />I do look forward to a sequel if that happens - one is hinted with the mysterious appearance of Professor Moriarity.<br /><br />We'll see.<br /><br />I give \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" 3 stars based on the plot, comedy, and action.  Would like to see more of the eerie and mysterious settings from the old Basil Rathbone movies.<br /><br />Still, a good movie to check out from the public library.
0446613444|2.0|I have read a few of Connelly's books and understand they are fiction.  I also understand that he has done some research within the LAPD re the Bosch series. I was a police officer for nearly 40 years--the lion's share of that within the LAPD.  There are so many inaccuracies including typos within this book and others that they have become difficult to read (Beretta is not spelled \\"Baretta\\" and there is no such thing as a .32 caliber rifle).  Not to mention that within nearly every novel so far there is a \\"bad cop or FBI agent\\" as a central figure.  Yes there are bad cops but come on---in every story?  Again---I understand that these books are fiction but Connelly makes so many mistakes--as do his central characters--that the stories become unbelievable, and not in a good way.  Harry Bosch would never ever be permitted to do what he does in these novels and remain a cop.   Do you really think any detective would be permitted to go into another country to conduct a followup investigation by himself without the explicit approval of his superiors? Then become involved in a homicide and not report it? He would be lucky to get a job as a security cop after that and would more likely be put in jail.  Again--I understand these books are FICTION but more homework by the author would make these books more believable, rather than just popcorn for the mind.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|Paul Conroy, an American truck driver in Iraq, is kidnapped and buried in a coffin and wakes up with a lighter and mobile phone and the resolve to fight for his freedom.  He is held to ransom and has to fight his fears, bureaucratic telephone personnel and his captors every step of the way.<br /><br />This film is set entirely in the coffin and the intermittent light source, frustrating phone calls with various government agencies and scrabble to free himself makes for one claustrophobic and chilling film.  The premise (being buried alive) is extremely scary and the political angle, whilst slightly clich&eacute;, adds another angle to the film that would be missing from a straight forward kidnap thriller.<br /><br />Ryna Reynolds is very good as Conroy and you feel his frustrations and fears along with him.  It is sad when he rings various family members and either gets through or reaches their answer machines.  It is very difficult to make a film of this type engaging the whole way through and whilst some elements are a little far fetched, overall this is a gripping story.  It is acted and directed well and make for just over 90 minutes engaging viewing.  Worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000001ELP|3.0|Still struggling with the exit of Peter Criss, Ace Frehley's indifference, and waning interest from a fanbase that was starting to feel cheated by the band, KISS stepped into the studio in March of 1981 and began work on their most ambitious album up to that point:  Music From The Elder.<br /><br />Under the guidance of producer Bob Ezrin, the band, along with new drummer Eric Carr, created an album that is generally hated and despised by the bulk of KISS' core fanbase.  There are a few of us out there, though, who either love or at least appreciate the album and what it stood for at that point in KISStory.<br /><br />Before Elder, KISS was looked at as a mostly loud and hairy rock band with an explosive live show.  Then the group produced the four solo projects, Dynasty, and the ill-received Unmasked, and this left many fans wondering exactly where the group was headed.<br /><br />If works like Dynasty and Unmasked estranged their fanbase, Music From The Elder put a boot through their foreheads.  It was unlike anything the band created before or since, and it has taken all of the thirty years of its existence to finally gain a bit of acceptance.<br /><br />The album was a concept album, which was in stride with contemporary bands of the time such as The Alan Parsons Project, Pink Floyd, and Styx.  The sound, however, was completely alien to standard KISS fans.<br /><br />In September of 1981, when fans hit the record stores to purchase KISS' latest album, what they received was an album that waded through ballads (with orchestral arrangements to boot), Paul Stanley singing in falsetto, and hints of Rush laced throughout the album.<br /><br />The album opens with orchestral fanfare and then goes into Just A Boy, a tune with music and Paul Stanley vocals very reminiscent of the Christian rock band Petra during the Greg X. Volz years.  The next two tracks, Odyssey and Only You, ar slow tempo ballads, with Only You being just a tad bit heavier.<br /><br />The album gets even heavier with the very Rush-sounding Under The Rose, which features Gene Simmons on vocals.<br /><br />It isn't until the Ace Frehley co-written Dark Light where hints of the old KISS sound rise to the surface.  Frehley shines big on both his vocal and string performance on this tune.  It is, in my opinion, the best song on the entire album.<br /><br />A World Without Heroes, is next, and stands just behind Dark Light in quality in my opinion.  If you've ever listened to Gene Simmons' solo album, you can hear just how much of his solo sound is in this song.<br /><br />After the somewhat quiet interlude of A World Without Heroes, KISS kicks it up a notch with The Oath.  While I personally like this tune, it doesn't work as well as Dark Light in my opinion.  In fact, I prefer the song that follows it, Mr. Blackwell, and the instrumental Escape From The Island, much more.<br /><br />Mr. Blackwell follows Dark Light as the most KISS sounding song on the album to me.  If the lyrics weren't about the villainous Blackwell and were instead about sex or scantily clad women, it would be the perfect sludgy Demon tune for an album like Hotter Than Hell.  Escape From the Island features some fine stringwork by Frehley, and excellent drum work from Eric Carr.<br /><br />The concept album closes with the anthemic I.  It is the only song on the album that I find myself singing along with out loud.  It has a very Queen feel to it and the excellent chorus keeps me interested throughout the entire song.<br /><br />So, is Music From The Elder a bad album?  Not at all.  In fact, when compared to other concept albums of that time, it holds up quite well.  When compared to the rest of KISS' catalogue, however, it fails to crack my personal top ten.  I appreciate what the band was attempting to do with this album, and actually quite enjoy Dark Light and A World Without Heroes, but I feel that at this point in the band's career, they were lost and searching for anything to spark interest in their music again.  Thankfully, the KISS ship would be righted somewhat by the band's next album, Creatures of the Night, which allowed Eric Carr to show people what type of drummer he really was and give Gene Simmons meatier tunes to sink his tongue into.<br /><br />I recommend Music From The Elder to non-KISS fans who enjoy concept albums like The Wall and Kilroy Was Here.  I also believe that any true KISS fans should own this album whether they enjoy it or not for the simple fact that it includes the last musical contributions from Ace Frehley until 1996's KISS Unplugged.lbum, Creatures of the Night, which allowed Eric Carr to show people what type of drummer he really was and give Gene Simmons meatier tunes to sink his tongue into.

0756404738|5.0|I just finished The Wise Mans Fear. As the \\"middle book\\" (think Two Towers), it introduced a new group of characters, explained some of Kvothe's backstory, and, I'm sure, set us up for Book 3. However, as some of the other raters have suggested, I'm not sure that this tale can be finished in only one more book--particularly considering the lengths of character development to which Rothfuss goes. The age-old problem with creating a new world, as Rothfuss did in Name of the Wind, is that when one revisits it in subsequent books, the wonder associated with the first visit is somewhat diminished--we expect these people to be living in this world. However, The Wise Mans Fear stood up to the test. It's an interesting tale set in an interesting world.     The book was extremely well written, held my attention, brought several groups of characters together who were all interesting, took place in a convincing, albeit fantasy world, and made me sorry to read the last page and close the book. I really can't ask for much more from a book. Just don't know if I can wait until 2015 for Book 3.

After receiving the book, I was a little thrown off since it did not look like the one in the picture, but did match the plastic comb description. I would not recommend the plastic comb format (binding) to anyone that wants to read the book while their child turns the pages, nor anyone whose child likes to \\"flip\\" through pages of books on their own.
B002U6CJCO|4.0|Universal Soldier Regeneration (2009) is a hard edged continuation of the universal soldier saga that forcefully demonstrates how violent and brutal the original concept could have been.  The film reunites the stars of the original 1992 film, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, and features ex-UFC champion fighter Andrei `the Pit Bull' Arlovski.<br /><br />The original Universal Soldier (1992) was released when Van Damme was near the height of his popularity.  Based on the intriging concept of reanimating soldiers and turning them into hybrid fighting machines, the film featured some action and violence, but had a comedic comic book undertone, that was fairly typical for Van Damme's films in that era.  The lightweight goofiness was cranked up, in the poorly conceived sequel Universal Soldier: The Return (1999), which could easily have brought the saga to a sad close.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Hyams, Universal Soldier: Rengeration (2009) is a gritty and meaner reboot.  With Van Damme and Lundgren past their physical prime, Andrei Arlovski assumes the most physically challenging role of the NGU (Next Generation UniSol), a genetically modified fighting machine.  Unlike previous versions of Universal Soldier, NGU is a truly ruthless and efficient killer, deadly with weapons, or in hand to hand combat.<br /><br />Dr Colin (Kerry Shale), a renegade scientist has made NGU's services available to General Boris (Aki Avni), the leader of a band of terrorists who kidnap the children of Russia's prime minister.  The group occupies the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, threatening to blow it up unless their demands are met.  The opening sequence where the abduction takes place, gets things off to a flying start, and establishes the brutal character of the film, as NGU operates with deadly precision.  The Joint Forces Command send a strike team to Chernobyl, that includes four older model UniSol's, but up against NGU, they are decisively crushed.<br /><br />Dissatisfied with the situation, Dr. Colin releases a revamped version of UniSol Andrew Scott (Lundgren) to eliminate General Boris and his men.  Scott accomplishes this task, but proves to be mentally unstable.  Captain Burke (Mike Pyle) is sent in to try and recover the hostages.  Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) has been in a rehabilitation program, but soon returns to his violent ways, and with time running out, is dispatched to stop the destruction of Chernobyl.<br /><br />There is a jumble of activity inside the plant, as hostages Dimitri (Yonko Dimitriov) and Ivana (Violeta Markovska), led by Burke, try to escape.  Van Damme has one major action sequence, but it's a damn intense.  Operating like a character in a video game, he racks up kill after kill.  Lundgren's availability was limited, so his part is rather small, but the film has a fantastic tightly executed fight sequence between Scott and Deveraux, with a mind blowing finish.  Lundgren and Van Damme do show signs of age, and although in reduced roles, they battle like true gladiators.  There is no shortage of high intensity combat, as Arlovski, MMA fighter Pyle, and others handle the remaining action scenes.<br /><br />Regeneration establishes the NGU as a cold-blooded and ruthless fighting unit.  The once affable Deveraux is all business, and Andrew Scott is just raving mad killer.  They don't have many lines, but the performances by Van Damme, Lundgren, and especially Andrei Arlovski are all very solid.  And Mike Pyle is quite impressive in his film debut.  Wherever these guys are, becomes a killzone.  The plot of Regeneration doesn't make a lot of sense, and the ending is a bit clich&eacute;d, but the film delivers an abundance of solid bone-crunching action.  Kudos to Peter Hyams and those responsible, for resurrecting Universal Soldier, and restoring much of its lost luster.  The writers made provisions for continuing the story, so perhaps there will be another sequel., Dr. Colin releases a revamped version of UniSol Andrew Scott (Lundgren) to eliminate General Boris and his men.  Scott accomplishes this task, but proves to be mentally unstable.  Captain Burke (Mike Pyle) is sent in to try and recover the hostages.

There is no shortage of high intensity combat, as Arlovski, MMA fighter Pyle, and others handle the remaining action scenes.        Regeneration establishes the NGU as a cold-blooded and ruthless fighting unit.  The once affable Deveraux is all business, and Andrew Scott is just raving mad killer.  They don't have many lines, but the performances by Van Damme, Lundgren, and especially Andrei Arlovski are all very solid.  And Mike Pyle is quite impressive in his film debut.  Wherever these guys are, becomes a killzone.  The plot of Regeneration doesn't make a lot of sense, and the ending is a bit clichéd, but the film delivers an abundance of solid bone-crunching action.  Kudos to Peter Hyams and those responsible, for resurrecting Universal Soldier, and restoring much of its lost luster.  The writers made provisions for continuing the story, so perhaps there will be another sequel.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is the most important documentary to be produced in the last ten years - and considering all the great documentaries to come out in the previous decade that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The plutocracy's rape and plunder of America's economic infrastructure is exposed for all to behold. If after watching this superb, disturbing film you are not in a blind rage at what these people have done to your once-great country, you might as well go back to sleep.<br /><br />Nighty night!<br /><br />Tom Degan
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game was lots of fun and challenging but it was really really short.  It only took 2 hours to beat.  Would be awesome if it had multiple levels
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This has to be my favorite app.  So easy to use.  Why bother with a satellite radio subscription when you can have access to tons of free programming.  Absolutely no issues with the app.!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This is a great app, unfortunately getting it from amazon was a mistake as it seems the amazon version is not the most updated version. if developers are going to sell in multiple stores they really need to ensure that all stores info and versions are the same.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I would like this app to have better podcast support. I could not find how to add podcasts that were not listed or how to download them in advance. everythinge else works great.
B004V7EW66|4.0|I didn't expect to like this album as much as I do. I haven't bought anything by Paul Simon since \\"Graceland\\". But I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed every cut, so I'm glad I read the reviews & bought it (even without listening to a single cut!). I'm very happy with the entire album (ok, mp3, but I'm old school)
B000001EIA|5.0|It's no secret that KISS' popularity was solidified by their live albums, particularly 1975's Alive!, and their live shows.  Full of electricity, smoke, fireworks, theatrics, and tongue-in-cheek tunes, KISS worked their lives shows as if each one was their last.<br /><br />When the popular 1990's MTV series Unplugged, where popular acts were stripped of their electronic equipment and played acoustic sets, announced that the hottest band in the world would be performing on their show, I have to admit that I had my doubts.  How exactly would KISS sound without the electric guitars, pounding bass, and all of their signature fireworks?  The planet was about to find out.<br /><br />On August 9, 1995, KISS took the stage and surprised not just their fans, but the entire world when they turned in one of the best performances of the entire Unplugged run.  Instead of leaning on KISS live show standards such as Shout It Out Loud, I Was Made For Lovin' You, Lick It Up, and Detroit Rock City, the band picked tunes that your average listener might not recognize and hardcore KISS fans hadn't heard in a long time.  The result was an excellent acoustic hard rock show that captured the power of the individual songs and the band members themselves.<br /><br />The actual show incorporated more songs than the Unplugged disc, but the CD comes packed with fifteen wonderful KISS tracks that are sure to please not only the KISS crowd, but people who appreciate acoustic music in general.<br /><br />The album opens with Comin' Home, an upbeat rocker originally from Hotter Than Hell.  Paul Stanley's vocals sound wonderful, and the band (consisting of the then current lineup of Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Singer, and Bruce Kulick) never sounded tighter.<br /><br />From this point on, the band hits the audience with excellent acoustic renditions of some of their lesser know tracks and a couple of obvious ones as well.<br /><br />With Plaster Caster off of Love Gun, Gene's bass pushes the tune along.  As sleazy as this track is, it fits perfectly into this acoustic set.<br /><br />The twisted breakup tune Goin' Blind, another Hotter Than Hell track, about a ninety-three year old man wanting to cut ties with his sixteen year old lover, sounds even better than Plaster Caster in this setting.  Of particular excellence is Bruce Kulick's guitar solo.<br /><br />The epic Destroyer album, which is quite possibly KISS' greatest studio album, is represented by two songs in this acoustic set.  The first song off of that album to be played is a personal favorite of mine, Do You Love Me?  The song sounds great and loses none of its original electricity.<br /><br />Another studio album favorite of mine, Sure Know Something, from 1979's Dynasty, is also featured on this album.  I love this version of the song.  In fact, I might go as far as to say that this version is my favorite.<br /><br />KISS ventures into their 90's tunes with Revenge's Domino and the ballad Every Time I Look At You.  Domino is quite possibly one of KISS' dirtiest tracks (and that's saying a lot), and it gets an excellent bluesy acoustic treatment here.<br /><br />Other albums represented in this set include Creatures Of The Night, Music From The Elder (which seems like an odd choice but actually works here),  and, of course, KISS.<br /><br />After perusing some great lesser known tracks in their catalogue, KISS then drops a huge surprise on the crowd by bringing out original members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley.  Ace sings Dynasty's 2000 Man and Peter belts out Beth.  Then Eric Singer and Peter Criss double up on an excellent rendition of KISS' Nothin' To Lose.<br /><br />So what song closes out an acoustic KISS concert?  The same song that closes out every KISS concert, Dressed To Kill's Rock And Roll All Nite!  Gene starts off the track by singing the first two verses and then after the chorus, Ace and Peter split the next pair of verses.  While there are no explosions or flaming guitars by the end of the tune, the song is no bombastic in its stripped down acoustic version.<br /><br />There are very few KISS albums that I would recommend to non-KISS fans that aren't greatest hits packages, but I have to say that if any album deserves a listen from non-fans, Unplugged is definitely the one.  It would become the concert that triggered KISS' successful farewell tour with the orignal lineup and spark interest in the band once again, proving that great bands always come back for more.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Here's the track listing by song and original album:<br /><br /> 1.  Comin' Home - Hotter Than Hell<br /> 2.  Plaster Caster - Love Gun<br /> 3.  Goin' Blind - Hotter Than Hell<br /> 4.  Do You Love Me? - Destroyer<br /> 5.  Domino - Revenge<br /> 6.  Sure Know Something - Dynasty<br /> 7.  A World Without Heroes - Music From The Elder<br /> 8.  Rock Bottom - Dressed To Kill<br /> 9.  See You Tonight - Gene Simmons<br />10.  I Still Love You - Creatures Of The Night<br />11.  Every Time I Look At You - Revenge<br />12.  2,000 Man - Dynasty<br />13.  Beth - Destroyer<br />14.  Nothin' To Lose - KISS<br />15.  Rock And Roll All Nite - Dressed To KillISS albums that I would recommend to non-KISS fans that aren't greatest hits packages, but I have to say that if any album deserves a listen from non-fans, Unplugged is definitely the one.

B004FOA84A|4.0|I couldn't open the game to begin with because it would force close every time. i restarted my phone (EVO Shift) and was then able to open it just fine.  The game itself is pretty short but entertaining. Seems to me from the ending that there will be more to come.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Forced close on LG Optimus. Uninstalling. Wish it would have worked though, it looks like a fun game. Will try again if bugs get fixed.
B00000K31V|5.0|Not only is David Croneneberg's \\"eXistenZ\\" another brilliant film that he wrote and directed but also my current favorite.  It is an engaging story of a couple who are thrown together to play the game \\"eXistenZ\\" that was created by the girl played by Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Jude Law plays opposite her.  It was my first exposure to him as an actor and I was quite impressed.  Cronenberg's story has a lot of similarities to other of his films like \\"Videodrome\\" but has a bit of a sense of a \\"road\\" picture, the couple on the run involved in intrique and some charming yet gross involvements thereby.  I might have enjoyed most of Cronenberg's work, but this picture had the added potential it could have hit a popular nerve.  Kudos to the entire Cronenberg crew.
B0037BB00I|2.0|I like the music and her voice but has no one else noticed the huge distortion in the base on the lousy mp3 recording? Had they no sound engineer at all? This dial goes to eleven? It's horrible base rattle like your speakers are blown. I switched to my 25 year old headphones and it was still there. So I went out and bought new speakers and new headphones. The rattling was still there, so I'm taking those back. The $60 headphones were not very nice so I bought the Bose QC15. I splurged. I love those. I am keeping them. Is the base over modulated on purpose? Is that what people like now days? I'm looking for a higher quality music source than Amazon but no one else seems to mind the distortion. Maybe it's my sound card. I should replace that.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Ran for awhile, then forced closed, seeming to cause a chain reaction with other apps, thought i might have to reset my phone! very unimpressed :(
B004FOA84A|4.0|Puzzles were fun. Game itself was too short though. Worked fine on my droid x for the most part. In game music volume control did nothing.
1400052181|5.0|Absolutely fascinating, true story of this woman and her surviving family.  I could not put it down.  A very good discussion book for you book club.
0553582038|2.0|Read this right after part 3 in hope of resurrection for the saga. I must concur with most of the fans that this is a loser and the story has gotten too rambling as opposed to the earlier character driven adventure and politesse. I read all that bollocks blaming publishers and etc., but the content is what did this one in. I won't be reading book 5 unless there's thunderous reviews and much talk of having resurrected the drama of the first two installments. I found myself forgetting who some characters were, since they weren't interesting anyway. Perhaps too many?    I watched part one of the mini-series based on Game of Thrones this past week, and it was awesome. What a bloody grim world the cinematography portrayed, just like the story was lifted from the written word, as I had pictured it in my mind.
014241543X|4.0|I LOVED this book!!  From the very beginning, you're drawn to the main character, Mia, and her journey.  I was intrigued with her life and where it stood for her for someone so young. I loved how blessed she was in every way from her talents to the people in her life.  This is such an easy read and I recommend it to anyone who believes in love and goodness.
055357342X|2.0|The story up to this point was magnificent, and now you've done in most of the captivating characters. I so enjoyed the first one that I had hoped the second would be even longer. Then I picked up this sequel, and after much slogging, finished this one out of passion for the series, chalking it up to writer's block or distraction with other stuff.
B004FOA84A|4.0|If you played Infocom Text Adventure games back in the day, and loved it when the Graphic Adventures (like Moonmist, etc.) came out, you will enjoy this modern &quot;look back&quot;.  I only wished it were longer.  :)
B004132I4S|5.0|I saw his tour of this album live and it was truly one of the greatest concert experiences of my life, including all the classical, rock, hip-hop and every other kind of show I've seen. The music here is at once accessible and challenging, and uplifting as well. The musicians are great and the music is full of the characteristic Sufjan Stevens attention to detail and richness.    Highly recommended.
0307887960|5.0|I did the Atkins 15 years ago and lost close to 40 pounds before falling off the program.  I started Atkins at the end of January and over a 2 month period I lost close to 20 pounds, until end of March.  Sticking to the diet, I hit a plateau it seemed and was stuck at one weight, give or take a couple pound fluctuation, despite exercising and increasing the water intake.  I am 3 days into this diet, which is a bit different from Atkins, and already I broke through the plateau with about 5 pounds already in the \\"attack\\" phase of the diet.  So far so good. I agree the meat and potatoes of this diet could be in a pamphlet though.  Also, I did try the oatbran pancake and they are good, but he writes to cook on the skillet for 5 minutes each side at medium heat.  This I found was about twice as long as the pancake really needs, unless you like them totally burnt to a crisp....
0316098337|4.0|After seeing this on many 2010 best-of lists, I was intrigued. The basic premise is hard to swallow, although it is certainly believable, but I feel Donaghue succeeded in keeping the focus on the boy and his experience of two completely different worlds. Donaghue also succeded in writing in the boy's voice. And the escape is so well-crafted, so suspenseful, that the reader truly can't put the book down.    The book also succeeds as an analogy for anyone who grew up in confined ways of believing/thinking/acting, and \\"escaped,\\" coming to realize the world is so much bigger than they were told.    A good story well-told. The best compliment a writer can be given.
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|This app works fine on the HTC Incredible. I tested it and the scanned copy came out better than the original. Great app for converting hard copies to electronic format.
B004M20YDU|4.0|I've gotta say... I like this one alot! Great remixes!! Especially Moby's \\"The Son of Flynn\\". If u like the original soundtrack, you'll be a fan of this one as well.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is amazing, especially now that big can record something if i like it. Also constantly gets updated which shows the developer trying to always make it better.<br />One of the best apps in the market imho.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. But it wasn't long enough. It needs more puzzles, maybe a side-quest or two, and more items to interact with. The only  drawback it had was no SD card support. I had to uninstall it because I was running low on space.
0375826726|5.0|Finally picked this up the other day and once I started reading it, I found it hard to put down. It's been a while since I read the first two so I was very pleased that it started with a thorough recap of what had happened up to that point. The characters are very well-rounded with their own motivations and complexities. The same can be said for the plot. I thought there was marked improvement in his writing as well. There are some valid criticisms. Some of the chapters go on for far too long. I'm thinking specifically of the many pages devoted to the forging of a sword. I must admit that I skimmed through a lot of that. But whenever the book started to drag like this, I usually didn't have to wait too long for a nice battle or action scene to get me on the edge of my seat again. I recommend this book and am excited for the next part!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I would say this is a fine game. Good puzzles with sharp graphics. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it was to short!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book for it's unique writing style from the viewpoint of a child.  What a touching and telling story.      Only negative - wish it had ended better.  Closing was weak.
B003ICWTR4|1.0|Sure would like to buy and listen to this concert, but of late I've been subjected over and over again to Springsteen's political drivel and have become suspicious of being lectured to.  I guess I'll pass a go back and listen to some old stuff he performed before he was convinced that his politics matter.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I live in the Bay Area in Northern California. We have tons of stations here. The station offerings were mediocre. No Wild 94.9 or KMEL 106.1 available. I'm a little disappointed but the app itself is cool. You can set your alarm to launch your fave radio station. Definitely useful but has room for improvement.
0553573403|1.0|Am I the only person who was extremely uncomfortable with the portrayal of the female characters in this book?  Sex with very young girls, rampant rape, and the general disregard/disdain for women through this book and the others in this series left me fuming.  As a woman who loves the fantasy/sci-fi genre I do encounter this on occasion, but never to this extreme.  Could have been a great series....
B004FOA84A|3.0|Downloaded this as Amazon's daily free app. Glad I didn't pay for it. Application force closed every other time it launched, but when it didn't FC, it was pretty fun. Gameplay was fun, but extremely short, and the ending was quite anti-climactic.
B001JNNDGA|2.0|I got mine 2 weeks ago, buy haven' t had the time yet to watch, as I plan to watch it today (Good Friday). My only observation so far is that, the cover of the disk itself looks pirated. I'm not sure if it is really like that or what, but cover is not glossy at all. I will have to watch it tonight after my work and I will update my review with the quality of the movie. I just hope, it is really original as the cover really looks it is not genuine. I crossed my finger that it is just a cover, and the movie copy is great.
B001DF68MA|1.0|This product is horrible!!!  It doesn't properly fit/install onto a bike, and even if you can get it somewhat on your bike....there is absolutely no room for you to pedal.   Even the design of the seat itself is pretty flimsy.  The back is much lower than it looks in the pictures, so your child basically has zero back support.  It's a no wonder they put the big surface on the front; your child has no back support to lean back into, so they need something in the front to lean onto for the support they need.     I wanted a bike seat that installed on the front of my bike because I wanted to see my child, but this seat wasn't going to work.  RETURNED!!!   Bought a Kettler seat instead.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|What a fantastic album by Foo Fighters. I agree with a previous reviewer that this is a new era for FF and they have begun it with a bang. I really enjoyed Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace, but didn't know where they were going to take things from there. They have progressed into something new while still maintaining their true form and their talent runs deep with this album. I highly recommend this album.  I purchased the iTunes deluxe album as it included some videos and a few more songs, including a wicked cool remix by Deadmau5 of 'Rope', which is already a spectacular tune. I love Amazon, but I really wanted the extra tunes. I wish they had the rights to release the deluxe version immediately! Purchase, listen in varying environments and repeat frequently!
B004FOA84A|4.0|i beat this in about an hour. the graphics were good, the game itself is entertaining but i was disappointed with the end. im hoping there will be more to this game in the future.
B004L49K20|5.0|This is an amazing album for hardcore Duranies and new fans alike. It's got that classic Duran sound with a freshness to it...you can't go wrong with this album.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this game and it worked fine on my Evo Shift.  Only complaint is that it is pretty short.  I think I finished it in about an hour.
0330519018|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue is unique from other books because of the perspective of a five year old narrating.  Emma Donoghue chose to write about what most writers would not choose because the touchy subject of kidnapping and being held hostage for years.  The fact that Jack had to grow up only experiencing what is inside Room changes his sense of reality and gives Ma a motivation to live and raise her son.  The book Room is a mystery and adventure all in one because of the attempt to escape and the mystery of what is going to occur.  Room will leave a lasting impression of emotional impact on anybody who decides to read it.  Many will agree that any book which can make the reader respond emotionally to the work is a book worth reading.  Room also shows how human beings under given conditions operate.  Ma and Jack show the readers how they can function and their daily routines under the conditions they have to live in.  Overall, this book has left a lasting impression and made my interest in mystery and reading books higher.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I use this this light holder everyday/all day, for the most part, and carry a Coast tactical LED light in it for 18 months.  After 14 months the elasticity begins to loose flexability and the light can slip out without notice.  Easy to clip into belt, but a bit difficult to remove (a good thing) and it doesn't fall off under stress.  I bought one for my son, an A/C contractor who likewise uses it daily with excellent results.  The swivel is great, freeing up hands to do other jobs. I just bought another for a friend to use in the South American jungle. I recommend replacement when the retention gripping  of the case begins to slacken.  They are not expensive and I haven't found a better product of this type.<br />7-30-12 Update. This is my third Nite Ize LHS-03 Clip-On Flashlight Holster with Stretch Capability and 8-Position Rotating Clip. I had to raise it to 5-stars because my testing of the holder in the high heat and humidity of the Amazon jungle of Venezuela for the last year has proven the holder to be very durable under tough conditions. I still carry my Coast LED Lenser HP8420 light every day and it has also held up well.  I certainly recommend this holder.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Can't save to SD, maddening sliders and other control issues.   Game is just an endless series of key fetching.   No story, not spooky as advertised.   Ugly graphics in HD for storage issues.  Internal puzzle logic is flimsy and petty.   Example(angles in child's drawing is key to statue orientation is key to a spark plug.)
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Product is great, has both optical input and optical output, has an analog input and it also has a front port for an extra set of wired head phones.  Works great, has digital audio decoding for Dolby Digital audio and pro logic Dolby Digital, for 7.1 surround.  I use it mainly for movies at night, so it's great for the bedroom. And it is also reasonably priced.    But the main problem I had with it is it doesn't have digital audio decoding for DTS audio, and most blu-ray films seems to use DTS audio for the main english soundtrack, so if you're really particular about true surround sound coming out of the headphones, this product only decodes Dolby Digital audio and not DTS audio.  Don't get me wrong, the 7.1 Dolby Digital surround sound for these headphones works just great, and really puts out great surround sound audio.  The Dolby Digital Pro-logic IIx, is also great, but it's not really true surround sound, so it doesn't sound as good as the 7.1 Dolby digital.  And if you try to run DTS audio through the optical input, no sound comes out, which is what you paid for.    The headset is awesome for xbox 360 online gaming, which is what it seems to really be designed for.  The mic works great and is very much adjustable and removable. The headset comes with an optical cable too. So if your looking for great xbox live headset, THIS IS THE ONE.  But if your looking for wireless headphones that you mainly use for movies, make sure it decodes Dolby Digital and DTS.    Even though it doesn't work for DTS audio, I still recommend this headset. GREAT PRICE, GREAT SOUND AND IT LOOKS PRETTY COOL TOO.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|have had the free version for a while and I love it. now the pro is offered for free, u should definitely snag this app. works great. not all stations are on here but u have to keep in mind they have contracts with certain companies, not all. so not all will be on here. otherwise, works exceptionally well. love the alarm feature and the record play back feature.
0393338827|5.0|Great book! Much needed! Michael has written another winner. The heart of this book is contained in pages 259 - 263 which describe the complete failure of leadership on the part of the Congress, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Governors of the various States. The creation of thousands and thousands of very large loans to unemployed persons with no assets that would eventually have to be paid back by the American Taxpayer was an unforgivable crime for which not a single person in authority has gone to prison.<br /><br />He describes how Henry Paulson, a person with no formal education in finance or economics, was given the TARP funds which he promptly used to rescue the Wall Street Elite. He reimbursed AIG for the $13 billion it had lost from the stupid insurance contracts it made with Goldman-Sucks on the subprime mortgage loans. Why should American taxpayers give their money to AIG and Goldman-Sucks? Why didn't Paulson put a stop to subprime mortgage lending in 2006? He had the power to do so. Paulson also handed $45 billion of Taxpayer cash to Citigroup and then guaranteed $306 billion of their assets. Why didn't Paulson crack down on Citigroup irresponsibility in 2006?<br /><br />Paulson's assistant during this mess was Timmy Geithner. At school, he studied Government and Asian Studies but mostly spent his time learning to read and write Mandarin. His main claim to fame was his failure to pay the United States the taxes due on his income. According to Wikipedia, he cheated the United States out of $35,000 in self-employment taxes and was assessed additional taxes of $14,847 by the IRS. He was eventually charged $15,000 interest by the IRS but without a penalty - why?. It is hard to understand why Hussein would appoint an Income Tax cheat as Secretary of the Treasury with authority over the IRS.<br /><br />Michael does not say much about the gross failure of Alan Greenspan to perform his duty to the American Taxpayer during the years 1987 to 2006 when he advised Taxpayers that \\"adjustable-rate mortgages were a good product and safer, fixed-rate mortgages were unattractive\\".  Greenspan's PhD Dissertation clearly foretells the housing bubble and the 2008 crash. Maybe Michael's stomach couldn't deal with any more incompetence and failure?<br /><br />With a dynamic trio like these three looking after his interests, the American Taxpayer didn't stand a chance.<br /><br />The United States was very lucky to survive 2008. Maybe, next time, not so lucky?\\"adjustable-rate mortgages were a good product and safer, fixed-rate mortgages were unattractive\\".  Greenspan's PhD Dissertation clearly foretells the housing bubble and the 2008 crash. Maybe Michael's stomach couldn't deal with any more incompetence and failure?

B004XDYJRU|5.0|Awesome app. Picks up radio stations all over the world! Finally punk rock radio among other stuff that's probably not being played local. Vibrant. One more word.
B004R10L4S|5.0|I read someone's review that this is liberal propaganda. I don't see how this can be propaganda when it is TRUE. This was a great movie that really gets to the heart of what has gone on for centuries: people in power thinking they can do whatever they want and get away with it! I loved Penn as Wilson--he did an excellent job and I was rooting for him. I was upset when Valerie was at first hesitant. If you like political and psychological dramas, get this film It's not super suspenseful, but I take away the message or idea and enjoy if for that mostly. After many years in Iraq we all should know they Bush Administration LIED and this movie just gives us the facts of that case, so if it makes Palme look innocent, then it's probably for a good reason (aka what happened). I'm more p'o d that Bush pardoned Libby and no one went to jail. This is how corrupt people in WA can get and I'm glad Palme/Wilson fought back...that's what I believe in.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I LOVE this app.  originally downloaded the free version.  this one adds the ability to record, but thats pretty worthless since u have to do that manually.  but i would i highly recommend this
1423113497|5.0|These books are going right into our children's library.  While the movie seemed to mash together different Greek myths with no discussion or explaination, the books give cause and reason for changes that made the books a far better read.  These are great books if your kids already have some knowledge of Greek mythology and are old enough to understand the changes.
B004FOA84A|4.0|pretty good puzzles. you need to do alot of back tracking and use a bit of grey matter to reach the end. short game though, it would be nice if there was more. final screen is a bit confusing because it doesn't tell you plainly that you are done and the final words from grandpa seem to imply there is more. graphics and sound effects ate pretty good.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|Many people rave about this series and I can understand why, at least to a point. Michael C. Hall does a stellar job as Dexter. His story line, solo scenes and the scenes with his adoptive father Harry (James Remar) are brilliant. However, some other parts of the series fall flat.<br /><br />The side characters and story lines are either unbelievable, unlikable, stereotypical, or just too unrealistic to take seriously. For example Dexter's sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) comes off as a whinny, neurotic, idiot who gets more annoying with each episode rather than the naive but tough as nails police woman they TRY to make her out to be. She and the other female characters definitely send out some mixed messages about what \\"strong\\" females they supposedly are. Besides being the smart, savvy, brave police chief, or courageous yet downtrodden single mom, or tenacious, street wise chick climbing her way up the ladder of the Dade County PD, they also come off as either vacant, impulsive and/or dimwits who are ruled more by their emotions and hormones rather than their brain cells.<br /><br />These women are often more difficult to watch than the horrifying blood baths that make up much of the shows darker side, which is kind of sad considering the darker parts of the show are bloody brilliant (pun intended). Also, the male side characters on the show aren't much better. More stereo typical, macho BS thrown in to fill time between Dexter's next kill. Makes me wonder if the writers aren't so focused on Dexter that rest of the show gets scribbled down at the last minute just so they have enough to fill an hour.<br /><br />At any rate, I definitely think Dexter is worth watching. The mystery aspect of the show and the Dexter story line are delightfully dark, well acted and just plain fun to watch. Just be aware, if you don't do well with gore, you may not get passed the first episode. That aside, if you keep focused on Dexter and don't look to the side characters for anything other than filler, then you shouldn't be disappointed.then you shouldn't be disappointed.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Finally a radio app with all the local stations! It won't really work with slow connection, but with my Mytouch 4g internet it works awesome.
1439102724|5.0|Excellent book...starts a little slow and some parts are slow, but overall excellent book. It makes you sit back and realize the challenges that many gay/lesbian couples are faced with, not only with children but with all aspects of life and how unfair they are treated....would make an excellent \\"book of the month club\\" book because it would raise alot of questions for discussion.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have never reviewed an app before, but after trying this app I just had to.i was dreaming of an app that would allow me to listen to my local am stations and this did it flawlessly.in addition it has a recording feature! You can record music like we used to in the 80s and 90s
0307591549|5.0|Shawn Achor captures in this book so many of the principles that we think we know, but unless we make intentional they get lost.   These Seven Principles are like changing the oil in your relationship engines before the crank case runs dry and cracks and is beyond repair.  In my work coaching of business leaders there are many pages that we have dogged eared for follow up discussion.  I highly recommend The Happiness Advantage.

B001KZI2WW|4.0|Good quality shoe for the price.  One seems to fit more snug than the other but, that may be my foot.  They are comfortable and easy to spend a decent amount of time in.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Amazon tends to lump the reviews for all the different versions of the product together. This review is for the DVD version.<br /><br />The movie is fine and the audio is great, but the video transfer is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. Or, not seen, if you catch my drift: even with the lights out at night in a perfectly dark room, the first 1/3 of the movie is completely unwatchable. It's not just that the movie is dark, it's that the movie is lacking any sort of brightness at all.<br /><br />On my TV, the movie looks like it was shot in dense, black fog. I was keenly disappointed, since the deleted scenes looked fine.<br /><br />I have a Panasonic plasma TV and a Sony DVD player. Neither piece of equipment could be considered cheap or low-end. The difference between the picture and anything else I have ever put into the DVD player is like, er, night and day.<br /><br />I played around with the menus on the DVD player, and could not find any unusual settings. And although I performed some experiments (turning progressive mode off, fiddling with the black level, and the cinema modes), nothing I did made any real improvement to the picture.<br /><br />Since not everyone who bought this item is complaining about the poor video quality (although quite a few people are), I'm not sure if this is a quality control issue, or if the studio made some technical decisions about how to compress the video that only show up on certain players and TVs. You would think that Warner's would know what it is doing. Presumably, so does Sony, who invented the DVD format (along with Phillips).<br /><br />I put the disk into the DVD drive on my desktop computer, and the picture looked fine. The movie was dark, but you could see what was going on. I suppose I can watch the rest of the movie that way. My computer monitor is significantly smaller than my TV, but at least I can enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the title of the review should have been, \\"Are You Feeling Lucky?\\" Because it's going to take a bit of luck on your part to get a DVD that's actually watchable. Judging from the other reviews, about 10 to 15% of us are having problems watching this DVD.<br /><br />p.s., the real \\"extras\\" on this disk are the interminable parade of ads for other HP products you are forced to wade through before you can arrive at the main menu.<br /><br />UPDATE: The fact that the disk played tolerably well on my computer led me to suspect that (gasp!) my TV might need adjusting. I had several DVDs in my video library that included the TXH optimizer, which is probably the simplest way to check your TV setup. Sure enough, the Picture/Contrast setting was too low, and the Brightness was so poor, I couldn't even begin to make the necessary adjustment!<br /><br />Some scouring on the internet got me the secret formula for entering Service Mode on my Panasonic TV. I found the menu for brightness, and boosted things until I could actually see the TXH drop shadow. Once I exited the service menu, I had to tweak the Black setting on the TV, and then I was able to finish the THX optimizer adjustments, including color and tint (you'll be needing special blue glasses for this last step, order them from the TXH consumer web page).<br /><br />Bottom line: it was my TV, not the disk.<br /><br />However, it would have been a lot easier all around if Warner's had included a test screen on the DVD. They wouldn't have had to include the TXH optimizer (I'm sure there's some sort of licencing fee invoved), but they could have had a test pattern that said something to the effect of, \\"if you don't see all ten levels of black on the next screen, you need to adjust your set!\\"<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this was the ONLY DVD I've found to be too dark. But everything is better now, and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.<br /><br />p.s., THX has a list of DVDs that include the THX optimizer. Search the internet and you will find them. One of my favorites is \\"Tombstone.\\" Anotheris \\"The Man Who Fell To Earth\\". The entire Indiana Jones series includes them, as do quite a few titles from Anchor Bay. Chances are, you already have one or more of them in your DVD collection. If this disk is too dark on your TV, it's probably time to adjust your set!Anchor Bay. Chances are, you already have one or more of them in your DVD collection. If this disk is too dark on your TV, it's probably time to adjust your set!
B00122M2QU|2.0|This album is really a bad one. Forget about the good moments Sepultura had or even some good Soulfly albums. THis album has many unlistenable tracks. There is not a any sense of melody and they sound extremely monotonous. Only for very fanatic friends
B004GYY714|5.0|This seemed a bit &quot;meh,&quot; but the reality is just awesome.  The application makes it very easy to search for all your favorite music stations.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a terrific game app. I have a Thunderbolt-- no problems with running the app at all. Beautiful graphics, smart puzzling, intersting and fun.  I couldn't wait to get to the end. Keep up the great work Fire Maple Games!
B004FOA84A|3.0|it worked great for the first 10 min. then Fc and now it won't even start, it force closes every single time, even afte I uninstalled and reinstalled
B004XDYJRU|5.0|had the free version from the android market and loved it so the free pro was a no brainer. only complaint is it needs the save to sd option. thanks.
B004FOA84A|4.0|to anyone having the force close issue on the DROID X...after the app installs simply power off and reboot your X. not sure if this works for everyone but it worked for me. Good game. a little short though. I love these types of games.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app use it to lisssen to kawaii radio &amp; Anime inf &amp; many off my favorite Anime online radio stations. Hope the keep updating the app
B004FOA84A|2.0|I was able to play this game only once. The very next time I tried to play it, it force closed each and every time. it's too bad because I really enjoyed playing it the one time I could get it to open.
0316098337|5.0|This short book will take you from disapproving, to shocked, to completely appalled, to amazed in the 48 hours it takes you to read it.  Room is fascinating and you're not going to be able to put it down.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is the real deal. An official controller from Nintendo with the fresh texture that all the new controllers had. The white color is true and the extra long cord is a welcome touch. Extra winding of the cord is necessary of course. If you're looking for an official GameCube controller to play with then this is it. Perfect for Melee and Brawl.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|After reading this book, you'll be upset that the author is dead.  There's a lot of questions left to interpretation, but it's just as thrilling as the preceding two.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Worked perfectly on my EVO Shift. Nice and cleaning looking game. Not terribly difficult. Quite entertaining but short. Definitely worth picking up at $0.99, even more so as the free app of the day. Excited to play the pending sequel.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was a lot of fun, despite the fact that it was short. Sadly, people are giving it bad reviews because of tablet incompatibility or because it's short, but even if you get an hour of fun for FREE, it's worth it. It's amazing how many people whine about something they got for nothing.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|After completing extensive research, driving around town to the limited number of audio stores in the area and agonizing over this decision, I settled on these for my first pair of high-end headphones. It's been a couple months now, and couple hundred hours of burn-in, and I must say I am satisfied and thrilled beyond belief.     Out of the box, and without an amp, these are quite possibly the biggest disappointment you could buy. Luckily, I was prepared for this and had a FiiO E7 amp ready to go. Fast forward a couple months and what a difference. The bass, once tinny and lacking, is now warm and just the right amount of boom. Most other headphones of comparable quality (borrowed from friends and compared) sound slightly muddier, the instruments not as layered, the sound smooshed together. The difference is not striking, but it's there, and you can be secure in the knowledge that these cans provide the clearest, most accurate sound for this price range.     Trance and electro used to sound thin, but now the massive rich soundstage is brought forth and the sound envelops your head so that if you close your eyes, it's like your own personal concert. Jazz and female vocals sound the best. Every breath is articulated, every extraneous sound from the instruments is reproduced, it's like Ella Fitzgerald is singing right there in the room. Live recordings are really LIVE! And movies sound like a faithful theater reproduction, very three-dimensional.    Do your research before purchasing a pair of high-end cans, but count this as a positive recommendation for these amazing headphones. I will probably never need to buy another pair.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Installed it on my Xoom wi-fi running Android 3.0.  First couple launches resulted in force close.  Could have been a problem with the super-buggy Android 3.0.  Finally it launched fine.  I went into local stations but nothing happened.  Finally was able to select one local station yet it could not connect.  Tried 6 or 7 other stations before I finally got to one that seemed to be working, but it was hard to tell at first because the app does not indicate to you what it's doing.  Got disconnected after 2 minutes.  Not a robust app but if it works on your device, you'll get access to tons of radio stations.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game doesn't scale properly to my phone (HTC Evo) and my Nook Color. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that both are running CM7.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|i love this book. At a book store i've pointed out this book to people in the same section. Once i even had someone else point it out to me. It really it just one of those books that male or female there is something for everyone. My non reading other half even read this book and is looking forward to reading the next. (the first and only book he's read in over six years). If nothing else this should tell you how much we have enjoyed this book.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|I think all the songs on Surtur Rising come together well to create an album that's great listening from beginning to end.  Unlike some these days where there are three singles and a half dozen tracks of filler everything on here is quality.    A question: has anyone else noticed static in the few quiet parts of the album?  Most notably at the beginning of Slaves Of Fear and about 3:35 into A Beast Am I.  I've tried playing it on three CD players and the mp3s I ripped off the CD and noticed the same static every time.  Is this intentional?  Did I get a bad pressing?  Anyone else have this problem?
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is pretty fun but is short enough that it does not have any replay value. The part of finding the key word for the globe was really tricky I thought. I almost got to the point where I tried to brute force it. Also I think that there is a problem with a memory leak, when I finally finished I only had 20mb of memory free and no programs were running in the background. Please fix that, devs!
B00284BNKC|5.0|Drugs are bad because they'll make you want to put the Wayans Brothers in your independent movie.<br />Based on the novel by cult author Hubert Selby Jr., Requiem For A Dream is one of the few movies that improves on its source material. Darren Aronofsky is a visionary director and this is his masterpiece.<br />The story centers on a group of drugs addicts living in New York. Everytime someone in this movie uses drugs Aronofsky employs a series of quick edits meant to simulate the effect of getting high. I used to edit home movies like that, but I had to stop after my relatives got sick.<br />Requiem For A Dream should be used as an anti-drug educational film, shown in every high school Health class. No other film has been quite so honest and realistic in its portrayal of long-term drug abuse,<br />This film showed the horrors of many addictions, but none were to scratch-off lottery tickets. They're my only weakness - MY ONLY WEAKNESS.<br />When I die I'll be found covered in that glue stuff you scratch off the ticket, holding a winner in my hand. Oh my God, the irony.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Good graphics, good sounds, and works well. Some parts take some serious thinking to get through but in the end it leaves you wanting more.
B003X73QA8|1.0|I remember sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting for Eminem or Lady Antebellum to win the Grammy for Album of the Year. Whoever The Suburbs are, their album \\"Arcade Fire\\" has no chance at winning. They're nobodies. Twitter was exploding with \\"uh, who?\\" comments, and rightfully so.<br /><br />A total injustice took place that night. Deserving acts lost to The Suburbs for the Grammy. I tried screaming at my TV, but no sound came out. I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />So apparently this band is actually called Arcade Fire (weirdo name) and they have a fanbase that consists of only people on the internet, or so it would seem. I don't know anyone personally who is familiar with this group. Since I'm known as the \\"Music Obsessed\\" in my group of friends, I took it upon myself to hear this album for myself and report it back to them. Big mistake.<br /><br />The vocals are so whiny, the singer named Win (more like Fail!) constantly sounds like he is on the verge of tears. Cheer up, man... it might be hard to, though, since your band is so terrible. There are like seven members in the Arcade Fire, some I believe are multi-instrumentalists, which is weird since all of the music sounds like something you'd expect from a beginner. Attempts at a \\"grandiose\\" feel are nothing but ill-fated attempts at replicating Coldplay's stunning \\"Viva La Vida\\" sound. Please spend your time & money on listening to more interesting indie bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Muse, MGMT, Vampire Weekend and The Killers.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Never had a force close to this point, droid incredible. Runs smooth. Wish it had sd capability but not to worried about it considering once I beat it I will be uninstalling. Worth the buck imo, unless you get it free in the amazon market which makes it a no brainer. Hope to see additional games like this in the very near future.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game has amazing graphics, when it's not force closing.  If the force close issue can be fixed it would get a few more stars.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Tunes in so many different types of radio signals.  Records radio and presets are very well done and integrated.  Includes police fireand other local service signals as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is addicting and fun.  It's not too similar in story like like its predecessors, but this Angry Bird is great to have in any Angry Bird lover's collection.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I do NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, mean to denigrate the Corps, and what they did during WW II. My Uncle was a Marine at Iwo, Saipan,Luzon,and island hopped all the way to Japan. (He later went to Korea) But, even he, who was a MARINE to his dying day, laughingly called himself a \\" Seagoing bellhop \\". This was a sideways tribute to the Navy which got them to where they had to go; often during sea battles. As a Navy Vet of Viet Nam, I thank them for saving my life. Remember Midway, Coral Sea, and the USS Indianapolis. That aside, it is as touching, heart-rending, and moving as \\"Band of Brothers\\" was before it
B000UW8596|4.0|Well...man...lol. This movie is just brutally honest about the horrors and atrocities that actually occur in the world, and within the secret lives of the psychopaths in positions of power in the world. Probly the most shocking movie I'VE ever seen though, and I've seen lots...
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Had every station I was looking for and they sound amazing.  I can't think of anything else that this app would need. It is a must have
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Regardless of you political beliefs or ideas, you can't help but appreciate the hard work and dedication displayed by the author and his SEAL Team.  I am glad that we have such great American soldiers on our frontline (and further in).  This book is an excellent read and is very difficult to put down.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Get to listen to local stations. Podcasts need more than just a few select episodes. Enjoying it so far. For the price its not bad.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Program would never fully start up; it would begin and then issue an error message and request a Force Close. Tried multiple timed with same result; uninstalled. Droid X
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is really fun. The graphics and music are great. Two negatives... It's very short so I'm happy it was free and its annoying that you have to sit through the title screens even if your display times-out. I really hope to see a longer sequel. -1 star for length.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I know 1 and 2 have been out for quite some time.  With my two oldest children being girls, nine and six, I never thought they would be interested in the series.  Our two year old son got TS3 last x-mas, and we soon found we needed 1 and 2 to complete the collection after the girls got a little tired of seeing it played every night(the little guy didn't). This series is perfect for girls and boys. My oldest girl found that she needed a Jessie doll along with PJs. I am wowed to see this in Bluray. It's so lifelike.  The only thing that bothers me about Toy Story is that I don't think they plan to carry on with a 4. Buy any one of the series and your child will love you for it!
0765326353|5.0|enjoyed every part of this book. It kept me interested at all times. It was not repetitive, or unoriginal. Amazing beginning to what looks to be an amazing story. I can't wait for the next one.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|best music app period! I am blown away by the possibilities.  I don't see myself ever using Pandora or slacker again.  ever. get this app now.
0743437497|5.0|All the praises have already been sung by the 600+ previous reviews.  If you a fan of horror or Stephen King, this is a must-read.  I cannot believe it took me this long to read it!  Hint: If you're a scaredy cat like me, don't read it late at night when you're alone in a big house!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There's so much weak music these days - to my ear, but this CD is super.  You will be hearing several of these songs on the radio for months, and they/she deverves that exposure.  They are pop-y but also soulful.  Get this one!
B003UESJHO|4.0|This is a film based on a true story that we've all heard before in one form or another.  All the acting was pretty good, but I have to say, Christian Bale made this film.  When I first saw him on the film, I actually thought, \\"Wow, is Bale now on drugs?\\"  As I quickly learned the story, I started to admire every aspect of his acting to capture the essence of the character - his looks, his accent, his walk, his chewing... He deserves his Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|==SPOILERS==    I remember the commercials for a show featuring a bunch of people stranded on an island, though I never gave it a second thought.  \\"All the good television shows have long since passed\\" I would say to myself.  \\"Nothing can ever be that good on TV anyways\\" Eventually I purchased a subscription to Netflix and saw Season 1 of LOST as one of the instant watchable movies.  So I figured, why not? It honestly took me about 3 days before I could actually get myself to sit through the pilot episode.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"This is just castaway with more people.\\"  Eventually I made a point to myself to at least sit through the pilot completely before I gave it up completely.  At the end of the credits, I was blown away.  I didn't actually get into LOST until the break between Season 5 and 6, but it was only a matter of months before I was finally caught up with the rest of the world.  I ran to the living room intently every Wednesday night and watched as the mysteries unfolded even more.  The night finally came for the Finale and I remember sitting at the screen with my jaw dropped and tears in my eyes.  It was beautiful, it was magnificent.  It was everything I ever wanted it to be.      Lost had it's mysteries, Which I thoroughly enjoyed.  But what Lost also had, was the characters.  This show was the very first show I have ever experienced that dug so deeply into the lives of these characters, so much so to the point that if something were to ever happen to them, you honestly felt like you had lost a best friend.  I can honestly say that before Lost, I never let a character death get me down.  I would just pass it off as saying, \\"man that sucks.\\" But when I watch Lost, even after my constant rewatches, I find myself glued to the television set in the hopes that they won't pass away the same way, almost feeling helpless as though I could save them but can't.  That's how deep these characters have become intertwined within my own life.      Even after the show is long since gone, I will forever find myself coming up with theories and ideas about what I think happened next, as well as the mysteries that weren't answered.  I'm honestly glad that the producers didn't give in to the fans demands.  I'm glad they had a story to tell, and told it their way, rather than giving in to people who honestly don't realize what they want.  Had they given away all the answers, we likely wouldn't have liked the answers given, and in that sense, it gives us the ability to keep the show in our hearts and minds as the years pass, constantly wondering \\"Who built the statue?\\", \\"What is the source?\\", \\"What happened after Hurley and Ben took over as protectors?\\" We won't get these answers because only our imaginations hold the key to these answers.  And I'm ok with that.      After all is said and done, I can say Lost has been the most amazing experience for me.  I've even made it a plan of my own to have the Island from Lost be my heavenly paradise when I depart from this world, as I myself am a man of faith.  I've even gone so far as to plan it out as me living the life of the characters on the island all the way up into the end, and when the light gets restarted at the source, that is when I \\"wake up\\" as the losties did in the sideways world, and remember my time here on Earth.  Using Lost as my greatest inspiration, I'll have a memory I will cherish for eternity, and I'll bring that admiration and inspiration into my next life as well.    Thank you Lost, thank you for giving me hope again.  Thank you for providing me not with entertainment, but a way of life.
B00005JPFH|4.0|People need to understand something;<br />Sam (the director) was trying to please too many people while making this movie...<br />1. Sam wanted Sandman (Thomas Haden Church.<br />2. Audiences were expecting a New Goblin (James Franco).<br />3. And the studio and fan alike were pushing for Venom (Topher Grace).<br /><br />The director crammed a lot into this movie! And for the most part he did a great job! A well told story about how Peter Parker (Toby McGuire)struggled with his inner demons and fought with the black suit! Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter's romantic relationship was showing conflict like any average relationship would.<br />All the villans in this movie (Venom, Sandman, and New Goblin) were all personal for Spider-Man/Peter! And each character served a good purpose!<br /><br />I think I know what destroyed this movie, the same thing that destroyed X-Men: The Last Stand; Hype...! People were raving and talking about it for a long time and expecting too much and a lot out of it! And when I say people, I mean even the critics too!<br /><br />I was not hyped or raving about this movie and when I sall this movie in theaters, I loved it. I admit it had it's flaws, the biggest I think is our heroes and villans being bashed against brick walls, thrown through glass windows, etc. and not having any marks on them afterward. That didn't go well with me.<br /><br />I also enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand so I ended up enjoying this movie as well.<br /><br />My advice to you my dear reader: Watch the movie without nit-picking at it and you might enjoy it!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Fairly entertaining but extremely short.  Not the hardest puzzle mystery game, but can pose a challenge at a spot or two.  Replayability is zero.  Four those having FC issues, reboot your device.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app that has reinvented the radio for your Android device. It is loaded with handy features. Who hasn't listen to the radio and wished they could rewind a few seconds? This app is will do just that. The layout and organization is superb. It was simple to find the radio stations I was looking for. It had all but one of the stations I was wanting from my old Kentucky home. Great app, worth the money, but free is even better. Thank you Amazon!
0307887960|4.0|This book is a tough read, so freaking repetitive! Could have been a 10 page pamphlet for all the droning on and on over very few simple statements.<br />That being said, it becomes crystal clear that the critics have not read it in its entirety or they would see (over and over and over) that a few days of a pure protein diet is not going to cause renal failure or any other kind of permanent vitamin deficiency or long term damage. That is simply ridiculous.<br />This program is efficient. And yes the calories are automatically restricted that in turn results in weight loss. The main point of this diet is to restrict calories WITHOUT being hungry and without cravings and that is what this book accomplishes.<br />I recommend it.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Seriously, this is probably one of the most useful apps on my Android. You can use it for fun, or it has some excellent references for daily life. It is a must have for any student or a life long learner.    Ask fun questions like, \\"mac or pc\\", \\"When will the world end\\", \\"1.21 gigawatts\\". Or plug in your birth date for some interesting facts.
B004FOA84A|5.0|didnt have any problems others had. no problems with it crashing. its a fun game. it is pretty short but for free its great. why does this have to be 25 words?
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is one of my favorite writers.  The Big Short is one of his best.  If you want a great backstory of the financial crisis in a compelling narrative, this is it.  If you're looking for a complete history of the financial crisis, this is probably not your best bet.  This is more a story of how the crisis unfolded through the prism of certain individuals who profited off of it.      It's a quick read and a page turner if you have any interest in finance, Wall Street or the financial crisis.  It will also make you pretty mad at the people at the helm of the big banks, as well as the credit rating agencies.
B004EC5IUW|2.0|This is one  which seems creatively great, but, I couldn't get with it.   Might be my old age.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Most males will stand up from watching the movie as if they're getting out of a bathtub of estrogen. Of course, women will obviously rate it highly for the same reason. Given Rowlings past public comments this let-down was likely inevitable.    Examples? In a 2002 American news interview Rowling snobbishly responded to a question on her reported high anxiety over the handling of the first film by director Chris Columbus; \\"Yes, I was very anxious - I mean, after all, he IS an American.\\" (By the way, no American actors were even considered for the series even though most are just as Socialist as some of her other comments prove.)     More recently, she responded on the internet to the enormous outrage over her making an asexual character into a homosexual (Dumbledore) by writing, \\"How dare you criticize what I write.\\" How dare us?? You broke the trust of parents by injecting your political agenda and this wasn't the only instance, lady. - How dare YOU!?    Anyone who was drafted into watching the series from the beginning (but, didn't read the books which accounts for most) and has any expectation of learning more of the subplots, director's (or author since she held that authority tightly) disregard for story cohesion and unexplained (whether alluded to or spoken) artifacts/behavior will be left wanting.
B0000062Y2|5.0|This is an original play  turned into a film.  Very  creative and very inspirational.  It takes you from  a real  scene(Getting off a bus)  to the biblical passion of Jesus Christ.   I don't think one can be unmoved  by watching this.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app works great and gives an amazing amount of variety. Read thru a bunch of the lower ratings and almost all of them complained about not getting one specific station. How ignorant can you get. It's not the app to blame if your favorite station won't allow streaming. Talk to the station, dont rate a superb app low.
B0017OB12O|5.0|This is the story of a career military man who experiences the meaningful pride and pleasure in creating something, rather than destroying it, as he's spent his life doing via war. It's a brilliant characterization of a by-the-book soldier who comes to understand that the creation of something positive and long-lasting gives meaning to his existence, provides a sense of accomplishment he's never known through decades of fighting--and it impacts him so powerfully that he does something at the end of the movie that you would never have imagined him doing at the start of it. Just brilliant. The evolution of this character is magnificently done, and the best part of this movie. For that alone, I highly recommend it.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I like that it shows the name of the stations, the logo, and what is currently playing on the stations listed.  Although, it doesn't show all the radio stations that I like - and doesn't have my favorite stations listed - but others may have better luck with it than I have had in that regards.  Streaming is great through my HTC EVO Shift and I do like being able to record songs I like straight from the stream in this app.  I can't remember how this \\"pro\\" version compares to the \\"free\\" version - but I do remember I didn't care for the \\"free\\" version I downloaded a few weeks ago.  Overall - I like this app ok, but others, depending on where you are may get more stations and be able to give it a better review.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Unfortunately, I can not rate this game's graphics, content, sound, etc., because I could not even get the app to run on my LG ally. Uninstalled.
