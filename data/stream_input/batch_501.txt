B00008OWZC|3.0|Led Zeppelin were one of the greatest bands of all time. Better in the studio than on stage. So I was prepared for the worst. To my surprise, a lot of this was pretty good. Thrilling at times, tedious at times and decadent most of the time.<br /><br />Disc 1 is out of this world, with killer performances of such songs as Heartbreaker, Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Since I've Been Loving You and Stairway to Heaven. However, the band were disgracefully self indulgent at times. Deep Purple on stage were also self indulgent, but they really knew how to play and keep it interesting for long jam segments. Besides, they had \\"THE LORD\\" on their side. Jon Lord on organ that is.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a painful version of Dazed and Confused that runs close to a half hour. Or at least it felt like it. \\"Bam-Bam\\" Bonham is one of the great drummers, but do we really need a 19 minute Moby Dick?<br /><br />Disc 3 begins with a milk it for 23 minutes version Whole Lotta Love, with trite versions of rock and roll classics like Let's Have A Party & Hello Mary Lou. Nevertheless, it is followed by a terrific rendition of Rock & Roll (you know, the Cadillac commercial song) which nearly makes up for it.<br /><br />Robert Plant is painful at times, thus coming across as a rather ordinary rock singer. But as one Amazon critic wrote, \\"I suspect Plant would have tried much harder if he knew that these concerts would have been worldwide releases 30 years on\\".<br /><br />With all this being said, the re-mixed and touched up sound is pretty good. Deep Purple's Made In Japan, which was also recorded in 1972, has excellent sound quality and performances.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm wondering, has anyone considered that mathematical organization of the album? If you recall the graphing coordinates (X,Y), the x-axis and y-axis, this is the result:    (Square One, Speed of Sound) = (X1,Y1)  (What If, A Message) = (X2, Y2)  (White Shadows, Low) = (X3, Y3)  (Fix You, The Hardest Part) = (X4, Y4)  (Talk, Swallowed in the Sea) = (X5, Y5)  (X&Y, Twisted Logic) = (X6, Y6)    I'm wondering if there is some sort of hidden meaning or correlation between each pair. You could almost make sentences from each pairing by filling in the blanks. Just an interesting observation. This is a great album that makes for an interesting study.
0894803123|4.0|I bought a Musso Ice Cream machine from Amazon.com (Great product).  The book that came with the machine was too basic.  I wanted something with more choices.  The Ben & Jerry's book seemed to have some promise.  The books covers many popular recipes which will be familiar to you (Based on store bought).  The stories that accompany many of the pages are quite interesting and somewhat entertaining.   <br /> <br />My biggest problem with the book is that all of the recipes call for RAW eggs.  They do not cover the custard style ice cream which requires you to basically cook the eggs.  With all of the conceptions that eating raw eggs can cause problems, its a shame that there is no explanation of this.  I would like to have some choices in my ice cream ingredients.  And putting in raw eggs makes me a little uneasy.  I have made ice cream using both methods, with and without raw eggs, so I know the taste difference.  However, the choice to use raw eggs or not would have been welcomed. <br /> <br />If you are looking for an entertaining, somewhat informative book to get you started with ice cream making, give this a try.  Don't hesitate to search the net for custard style recipes also.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Despite Dream Theater's having an unnaturally large number of raving fanboys, their discography tends to effect people in very different ways.  Of all the people out there who claim Dream Theater as their favorite band, about half of them seem disappointed in just about everything they've released since I&W, to some degree or another, while quite a few others are real big on SFAM, while feeling relatively cool towards their earliest work.  And this makes some sense, as the Dream Theater of SFAM thru  ToT is quite different from the one that came before, with their emphasis on conceptual works which lack conventional, tight structures.  And, the times when they did write individual songs, the tracks were blown up, with your typical track on ToT or the first cd of 6DOIT averaging about 10 minutes in length.  I however, never really feel into either of these groups, as though Awake is my favorite DT album,  SFAM comes very close, and ToT and I&W aren't to far behind either.  With 'Octavarium', Dream Theater moves quite a bit back towards the older DT sound, but with out totally abandoning the newer styling.  This is the sorta change which is liable to receive a somewhat lukewarm reception, which 'Octavarium' has received.  This time, I guess I agree.  This is another worthwhile album, but it's perhaps the weakest one I've heard from them,  But, it's a fairly distinctive part of their discography, so it's another solid release, even if it's far from mindblowing.<br /><br />On the first 6 tracks, DT display a level of concision (is that even a word? it is now) that they abandoned long ago.  These tracks come out to only about 40 minutes in total, an average of a mere 6 1/2 minutes a track. (aprox.)  Though there are still some leads, the wild, 'Dance of Eternity' style instrumental passages are gone, and the songs display an emphasis on melody and catchiness perhaps greater than anything I've heard from them since I&W.(note: I don't have FII)  Still, it's a bit heavier than that, with a deeper, more aggressive guitar tone from Petrucci, a la their more recent albums.  To go along with this, the general emphasis on instrumental proficiency is a bit less on this album.  So, those who only care for the DT instrumental sections will be a bit disappointed.  But, these are good songs, with the exception of 'I Walk Beside You'.  It's oft been compared to U2, and not with out good reasons.  The chorus is just grating, and the rest of the song is just blah.  'The Answer Lies Within' isn't too exciting either, just another wussy DT ballad, but, like almost all the other wussy ballads they write, I still kinda like this song, in spite of my better judgment.  It's not very good, but it's pleasant enough, so it works.  The opener, 'The Root of All Evil' is the sequel to 'This Dying Soul' and  'The Glass Prison', and it's another driving rocker, like those tracks.  Yeah, the riffage isn't as complex as what Petrucci usually writes, but the song moves with an intensity and energy rare to DT, and it's just a very good, rockin' track with plenty of melody and catchiness to boot. Great song.  'These Walls' has got an over the top, keyboard-laden chorus, which is undeniably quite cheesy, but still instantly memorable, and perhaps the catchiest thing I've ever heard from them.  The rest of that song isn't that amazing, but the chorus is enough.  'Panic Attack' is a nervy, careening number.  Heavier and less catchy than most of the other material, but very effective.  Not as immediately memorable as some other stuff, but it definitely works, and it provides a good contrast.  'Never Enough' is a bit of a mix of some of the older stuff, combining some memorability with some 'Panic Attack' drive and unpredictability.  Again, good stuff.<br /><br />The album shifts gears with the two closing tracks.  The 10 minute 'Sacrificed Sons' is pretty decent. but not all that impressive.  It's attempting to be all emotional, but it can't quite pull it off, and the instrumental section isn't totally appropriate to the tone of the song.  Again, pretty decent, but I've heard a lot better from them.  The title track is quite weird, but good.  It's 24 minutes long, but it's very leisurely and controlled, and surprisingly vocal driven.  It's got one wild, out of control instrumental section, but it's relatively short, particularly considering the overall length of the track.  It's a track that doesn't make to huge of an impression at first, but the moods and various melodies eventually works their way into your mind.  Again, not one of their best songs, but it's quite different from anything I've heard from them, and it works quite well, in it's way, so it's definitely worth while.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  Not their best by a long shot, but definitely worth checking out.ction isn't totally appropriate to the tone of the song.  Again, pretty decent, but I've heard a lot better from them.

B00001OH7U|5.0|Legend has it some bad stuff was happening to Bowie when he created this masterpiece, and he was sufficiently chemically detached that he barely remembers recording this chunk of brilliance...such are the wages of a personal crisis or so. The end result is a near-perfect, icy cool, yet overheated, way- out- there but utterly accessible rock album that wears its 30 years elegantly. To my ears, this is Part 1 of 'The Berlin Trilogy', except it was recorded in LA, and Brian Eno was nowhere in sight. The variety of musical approaches, Bowie's great pipes, and six killer songs, put this up there with his best half dozen or so albums.
0385335482|4.0|This book, the first in the series, was a great start.  It was fun, witty and laugh out loud ridiculous but hilarious.  I always thought I was a crazy shopper, but this book made me feel better.  Phew, I'm not that bad afterall!  I also love the way the stories unfold in the next few books w/ her and Luke's relationship.  But the last book in the series is a bit too much...that one was just disappointing.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of this band will trully appreciate thier diversity while sticking to thier roots and fundamentals with this release. I have to tell you as a music fan and always skeptic of 2nd and even 3rd releases, this is another incredible follow up. Some may criticize this release only because they haven't listened to it more than once. I promise you, this will grow on you and end up on your favorite cd on iPod. Buy it, enjoy it and listen often!
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I felt the Director's Cut too long.  I also was disappointed that the song, \\"Under the Milky Way\\" by the Church was removed from this version.  Music plays such an important role in the movie and the Halloween party scene was \\"limp\\" because this song was taken out.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|This is a time in the early 1950's when some women went to top women's colleges to learn how to be the \\"perfect\\" wife, mother and homemaker, rather than to pursue a career in law, business, finance and other male domains. Julia Roberts plays a brash new college teacher who instills in her students the motivation and thinking that they should be going after these advanced careers first and not just looking to get married to the right man.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Every time an established band releases a new album, there exists the risk of the bands failure to keep with the noise that made them famous. All bands can now take note in what Coldplay did in their recent release of this album. They kept the sound that makes them wonderful and wrote a handful of songs that will continue to push them forward in the world of music.   The songs written and performed are simply described as typical Coldplay. You get the heart-felt lyric, the pounding drum and bass line, the voice, and the overall sound. It is all the same as before and is made to sound well once again. I love nearly ever track on the CD. If you like what you found on the first album, if you like what you hear on the radio, and if you like Coldplay, then you will love this album.    This is money well spent and candy to the ears.
0792838068|5.0|Mike Figgis brought this touching ode to the night to the screen, imbuing it with the transient and tragic nature of those seduced and then swallowed up by it. The director of Stormy Monday perfectly captures the sad yet often poetic beauty found in the shared loneliness of the night two souls in despair can find.<br /><br />On the surface it is a simple story of a man drinking himself to death and a prostitute on the streets of Las Vegas. But it is really a story of love and loss with a foreign film atmosphere and quality, giving it that rare depth where the film becomes more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage gives a haunting performance as Ben Sanderson, a man who has lost everything and come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. On his way down he meets a prostitute named Sera and in their spiraling despair they discover love. One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when Cage is on the streets of Las Vegas seeking human contact and can't remember whether he lost everything because of his drinking or started drinking because he lost everything. Cage's performance rings absolutely true and deservedly won him the Oscar. He shows with great tenderness the sad realism of being an alcoholic.<br /><br />Matching Cage scene for scene is Elizabeth Shue in a brilliantly realized role that should have won an Oscar. As this lonely and isolated working girl begins to care about Ben she discovers she is not dead inside, like some, and can still love. But when Ben finally pushes her away in order to save her, she realizes that if she lets him, she may very well lose this power to love and her connection to being human. Going back, however, may be more than her heart can bare.<br /><br />Figgis has made a mesmerizing film of almost overwhelming sadness. This is not a `feel good' movie by any stretch of the imagination. There is both truth and poetry here though for those who know this life. Ben and Sera are like two roses; one withering at the onset of its last winter and the other finding an unexpected bud on a long dormant vine.<br /><br />An incredible sountrack with artist like Michael MacDonald and Sting is used to set the tone for this wonderful but difficult to watch film. Anyone who has ever been devastated by a loss and known a Sera or a Ben, or a combination of both in one, will be moved by this heartbreaking journey into loneliness and despair. Though brilliant, its appeal may be limited and it is easy to understand why some are not as enthusiastic about it.<br /><br />But for those who have ever seen or experienced a glimmer of this side of life and been shown the comforting tenderness of love on the way down, the final moments of this film will be almost painful to watch and deeply affecting. Figgis has made a masterpiece for all those who have walked away before the night swallowed them up completely and they were lost forever.er finding an unexpected bud on a long dormant vine.

B00000FBRE|4.0|The feelings cd is a good cd in general.  The songs on the cd stick more or less to the same theme.  The highest quality song on the cd is \\"love story\\" followed by \\"after you my friend\\", \\"train\\", \\"may 16\\", and \\"messengers\\".  If you really like lagwagon then gun in your hand and leave the light on are good as well.  The artwork on both the cd and cover for the cd are humorus especially in comparison with the boring cover on double plaidinum.  This cd does seem to be on a different line of thought than lagwagons other albums but it is still good.
B0006L16N8|1.0|There's one thing you can't take away from Coldplay: writting about them seems tightly connected with the heaviest superlatives. May those be positive or negative ones. I'm not about to escape that trend. <br />   I would have to think and think seriously hard to remember any album that was hyped as ridiculously as this one and was as much a mediocrity as this one. And I'm being generously mild here. Incidentally, hype can be tolerated (to a degree) if there's something, anything,  of substance to the object concerned.  <br />Problem is that \\"X&Y\\" is totally devoid of any substance.  <br /> <br />Full with pseudo-intellectuallisms, and pseudo Radiohead-isms it's one of those bland and generic albums destined to be audio decoration in super-market isles worldwide, soon.  <br />Not that it has been any different with past Coldplay albums of course. The band are supposedly gone experimental on this one (really? that certainly escaped me) and have become much more \\"daring\\".  Well, whoa, but possibly this refers to the coloring of the cover or something allthough that would be stretching it too. Since when they call music as lifeless as this \\"experimental and daring\\"?  If they use terms as these for Coldplay what would they use for bands such as Massive Attack or Tool or others who really deserve such chracterisations. The effort of the promotion gurus is remarkable isn't?  <br /> <br />   If you've heard one Coldplay track you've certainly heard them all. One recipe and that's it, three albums long so far and counting: one little guitar melody devoid of any passion, any life or inspiration, boring drum work in the background and even more boring nothing-to-tell lyrics to dress it all up uniformly. Tata... <br /> <br />   I can understand of course the english media praising this even beyond the levels they did with Radiohead (who did deserve most of the accompaning hype) but i somehow have more demands from the music and lyrics that go through my ears. Coldplay are simply nothing special. A gathering of people that in a different place, a different time, and with a different star-constellation in the sky, could, maybe, do something with whatever talent they theoretically possess. But this could be claimed just about anybody. <br />     <br />And whether while shopping in the super-market it's generic R&B or generic pop playing in the backround i'll still passionately ignore it. That and the products it's supposedly trying to make  me buy. <br />

B0009NSE1K|5.0|Listen to this album, again, and again.  It will blow your mind.You may hear a religious lyric or 12, but thats the lyrical genius of Fallon.  This album incorporates all that is great with the matured direction of this long standing band. Some songs..tend to be weak at parts, but within those songs, there are parts to them that will make the listener wonder why this band isnt gettin the recgonition they deserve after over 13yrs of touring. What is unique to this band, is their constant evolution towards being better musicians. You will find more keys on this album than you did on Blast Tyrant, but they are well placed and not over bearing.  If you liked Blast Tyrant, you will love this album.  If you are one of those idiots who are looking for Binge and Purge 2, carry on. This isnt for you.  TNSL 4/5, Self Titled  4.5/5, Jam Room 4/5, PRF 3.5/5, BT 4.5/5, RH/E 5/5.
B00062IDCO|4.0|The first thing you see when you get this box set is how bad the box is especially compared with the packaging for the original series.  If you only have enough money to get one season of voyager you would probably want to get season 3 instead.  It has the most supporters and you can argue the most original ideas.  The highlights of this season include the last episode called \\"endgame\\" because there are some good simulated space battles, \\"author, author\\" because it was more humorus and went back to the roots of making episodes haphazardly and at the whim of writers, \\"flesh and blood\\" also because there was a decent amount of fighting and combat, \\"the void\\" which seemed interesting because the captin although portrayed as trying to be the enlightned person who rises above the masses comes off more as a lunitic who has gone mad with power, and also barely making the list \\"imperfection\\" because the security chiefs acting is rather interesting in this episode.  Most of the rest of the episodes dont cut it because instead of focusing on entertaining the audience or telling some kind of story they try to tell some kind of moral that everyone understands anyway.
0064409422|5.0|Still magical after all these years.<br /><br />Narnia still got me `in', and I'm a bit harder to ensorcel than when I first read it back in school. While some would find it stifling, the undercurrent of clear morality is a vital part of what lifts this book out from the pack. Lewis had something to say beyond convention, he managed to combine it with his adult love of `fairy-tales', and this without condescension. Sure the characters are one-dimensional (something that put me off a bit on re-reading 'Out of the Silent Planet'), but do we really need tortured vacillating disenchantment in a kid's book? Moreover in some ways this allows for greater truth: we can lose moral clarity in hurling words, justifications and complications into some choices that are, at heart, simple. Lewis was a master of the stinging comparison, which can be used well or ill: just because a metaphor is clever hardly makes it true. However I think that there's a deal of insight and honesty in, for example, the revelation of Edmund's (let's just come out and say it) sinful thought processes. How does Lewis know about such ugly self-deception? There's a deal of confession in having the character most open to temptation as an intellectual, like himself.<br /><br />So, unlike some other reviewers, I reject the notion that you lose the joy of the book once you realise the deliberately Christian nature of this fable. Take that away and the book becomes just another cynical money-making venture. Lewis, rather, cares about his readers and wants to offer them a taste of something good, and an awareness of something evil. It's not that he's tacked a dumb and nasty old superstition onto a fabulous story - the story is only fabulous because it's fuelled by a passionate belief in the prime value of goodness.

B0000028M7|5.0|One reviewer here gave this album one star, called it too \\"disturbing,\\" and then blamed Alice in Chains for today's poser rock bands.  Someone give that man a dumb-ss award.  If disturbing music isn't your forte, then don't listen to it; there's no need to knock the band's artistic merit just because you can't handle it.  There's no \\"hope\\" in AiC's music?  No happy ending?  That's the damn point.  Certainly there was no hope for Layne Staley, who died of an overdose in 2002.     <br /> <br />Alice in Chains weren't the corporate whiners of today's music, they were four drugged out guys determined to give fans of heavy rock the dark and outlandish music that straight metal bands were failing to follow through on during the 90s.   <br /> <br />Other than that rant, there's not much more to say about Dirt than what has already been said here by countless other 5-star reviews.  The lyrics of Dirt are macabre, metaphorical, gritty, and eerie, Layne's singing and emotion is the stuff of legend, and Jerry Cantrell's influential and varied guitar work is memorably bleak and cryptic.  Together, Cantrell and Staley gave us one of the greatest rock bands of all time, a band that explored more music and depth with three studio albums than most bands can or will with ten or twenty.
0790729652|5.0|Tim Burton turns Frank Miller's verison of the Dark Knight, into one of the greatest superhero movies. The story takes place of the gothic town of Gotham City, who gets werid sightings of a man dressed a bat, whom they nick name ' Batman.' At first the people associate him, of course, as a villian. But the more and more they see him action, the more people in the city realizes that he is, in fact, a hero. Later on, a new villian is taken apperance in Gotham City, he refers to himself as simply \\" The Joker,\\" since he carrys a smile on his face everywhere he goes. We also find out who the REAL capecusader is : Bruce Wayne ( Micheal Keaton )  , a mysterious billionaire, who's parents died when he was very young in front of him. Bruce is dating a woman named, Vick Vale ( Kim Basinger ), a photographer, who gets caught in the middle of danger, when The Joker starts to stalk her. Leading to a cliff hanger ( pun intended ) of a ending.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? The acting? Top notch. The music? Elfman comes again with Tim Burton, proving they are a match made in Gothic heaven. The imagery? Gothic as ever. One thing I never got was, why do people complain about Jack Nicholson as Joker? I thought he was fine....so he isn't exactly a Jim Carrey of comedys. So, buy this movie. You'll definiately get your money's worth.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|1-liner: Confused son (William), bitter at father who has told him a \\"fabricated big fish\\" version of his life, finds resolution in discovering the truth of his father--which is not that far away from his tall tales.  <br /> <br />William's father is a small town hero who leaves his home to enter the real world: the cities and financial the schemes underlying professional capitalism. While in many respects, his father does not become the global hero that small town boy set out to become, he does become a successful man--a reputable salesman and a loving, responsible father.  <br /> <br />Yet, William's father is Walter Mitty-ish, living a real life and a fake life, one more incredible, greater than the man. The stories his father tells him are outrageous, but as an innocent and trusting child, Will had believed them all. The movie starts with story-told flash-back scenes of the \\"lies\\" his father told him, intermixed with shots of a gathering for a wedding aniversary, where his father, who is now old, tells his lies and tall tales to the gathered. The incredible stories are loved and accepted by all--except for Will.  <br /> <br />Will refuses to talk to his father, and they have not talked for three years, until he is notified that his father's cancer has reached a dire stage. He returns to his father and attempts to wring truth from him--to reach the other 90% of his father, the sunken iceberg secrets his father hid in his deep, dark, brooding sea of a mind. His father, however, is angered and outraged that his son believes him to be not the man associated with the stories.  <br /> <br />As he helps his mother clean out the abandoned swimming pool, now moldy and opaque, the semblence of a big fish stirring beneath the rod he uses to fish out the debris, Will realizes that he must try to catch the fish--to discover the truth of his father. He sets out to sort through his father's old documents, the deeds and invoices and papers of his life.  <br /> <br />Will findsthat bits and pieces of his father's tales are based on truth, although the final version involves some amazing fabrications. He tracks down Spectre, a small town his father had bought to save it from the ravenous financial monsters of capitalism gone awry. A belief that has always infuriated him is that his father, a salesman, was away most of the time and had an adulterous affair elsewhere. In the outskirts of Spectre, he finds the ten year old girl his father describes in one of his tale, but she is now aged and something of a witch character. She tells him the truth: she is a girl hopelessly stuck with an unrequitted love affair--his father had always been true to his wife, his love.  <br /> <br />This discovery brings Will to a revelation that allows him to atone his anger at his father's lies to him. As he lies by his father's deathbed, his father's doctor comes along and tells him the real version of his birth. There was no big fish involved, and the doctor admits that he likes his father's version better. It's more interesting, less mundane than real life, dreary reality. Will, however, likes the doctor's version, the truth, better. But, he has already come to accept his father for who he is, a man whose life is seen to be something of a envious legend to others, purely because he refuses to let the truth of things boggle him down, defying reality's stronghold against his fate for fantastics. Moreover, he realizes his father had been a good man, is a good man--despite his stretching of the truth in his tales.  <br /> <br />As his father recovers from the stroke that sends him to the hospital, Will gives his father his last triumph. Will tells him the story of the river, of how they escape the dire truth of reality, the finality of the antiseptic hospital emergency room, driving wildly to get away from the holds of the world, to arrive at the river, where everyone--all the familiar characters in his tales--is happy and waiting for his arrival. Will fabricatesthe tale so that he manages to carry his father all the way into the river, and then drops his father in its depth... and his father becomes a fish. A big fish. And, he swims away.  <br /> <br />\\"The biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught. (Advice from Old Witch)\\" The pure truth of his father's life shall be left unknown, as in death, his father flounders away, a free fish, the biggest fish, uncaught forever. William finds resolution in knowing that his father was a good man, despite his inability to tell his life the way it really happened, despite his inability to accept the mundane facts of life as is.  <br /> <br />Like What Dreams May Come, this movie is filled with bathos scenes--many of the camera shots are also reminiscent of Dreams. There are no spoilers above, although the plot is aptly summarized. Moreover, the man's death is foreshadowed--the fact that his father stumbles upon Spectre (wherein the place distinctly reeks of being the carefree afterlife), arriving \\"early,\\" then promising that he will return when it is his time. The glory of this film lies in the emotions it stirs within us. The beauty of it is portrayed via brilliantly posed scenes, the clever mixing of characters from the tales with real life, and the precise usage of comic relief in the midst of what would have been a bit dry if utterly serious.  <br /> <br />Will's completion of his father's story marks an elegant ending, where he carries on the task of his father, a man capable of living without being overburdened by life, a man who knows how to embigger the life of others through his tales of sheer magnificence--whisking his father away from the desperate finality of reality, the hospital room and his frail stroke-beaten health, to the fate his father saw in the glass eye of the witch's--death as the biggest fish in the water, uncaught. <br /> <br />{QM Multiverse: the time-seperated but simultaneous observation made by Will and his father renders the state ofhis death. Prior to Will's observation that his father is to die as a big fish, perhaps a different version of his death exists in the superposition of states. However, after Will states his observation, and his father's agreeing to it--the aged memories blurred, accepting of new content in place of the real--reality is set. Thus, his father's tall tales are real, though in a different reality, the one existing in his memories. They are real to him because he observed them, but when his reality mixes with that of others, others can observe in his place and he can revoke his observation for that of someone else's, thus make someone else's observation the \\"real reality.\\"}
B0006L16N8|5.0|In the beginning there was sound, then came sight and senses. \\"Square One\\" opens \\"X&Y\\" like the beginning of creation. It feels like a big event, a monumental experience. \\"What If\\" requires us to pause, reflect, be introspective. It starts out subtle, but builds in grandeur. \\"White Shadows\\" is a nostalgic techno influenced song that takes you back to the 80's with style and flair. \\"Fix You\\" is complimented by striking church organs and choiresque backing vocals. You feel uplifted and it elevates your spirits. I wish I could sit and describe every song, but \\"X&Y\\" was meant to be experienced through your ears not through a CD review. This album is heavy on atmosphere and instruments. It creates a mood. It is beautiful, picturesque, and sublime. \\"X&Y captures a range of emotions and sentiments. Those claiming that \\"X&Y\\" has no depth, lacks complexity, etc., haven't even heard the album. Words cannot really express my true appreciation for what Coldplay has given us with this record. A new day in music has come. I had almost given up hope, but Coldplay has found a way to restore my faith. Great bands do exist and so does great music. Thank your for \\"X&Y.\\"
B0006L16N8|5.0|No matter what anyone says about the differences between \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and \\"X&Y\\", this album is by far a step forward for Coldplay.  I've read many reviews saying that Coldplay has lost their touch and that this album is not as \\"Pop\\" and interesting as their previous albums... Which is rediculous because why would the fans WANT another album to be EXACTLY the same?  Then you've got Rage Against the Machine on your hands!!!  Take X&Y for a spin and what you'll find is perfectly crafted songs, emmaculate lyrics and singing supplied by Martin.  You'll also find textured guitars and melodies that overpower your senses making this record much more dense and intense than their previous work.  Don't get me wrong, Rush of Blood is a great album that has wonderful songs, but X&Y is a better album and has the power to send you off and listen to it over and over again.  It's fantastic!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I really had very little expectation. I had a feel for their sound, but I couldn't imagine what their next move was going to be. Thankfully, it's a complete surprise. Far better than I ever could have expected and more tangible than \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" I'm really making a greater connection to the songs this time. So I would recommend this for both old and new fans of Rock music.
B0002858YS|5.0|This has got to be one of the best rock albums that there is out there right now. &quot;The Killers&quot; C.D. &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; is filled with excellent songs. I like each one of the songs. Very few bands make a C.D. where all the songs are strong. The Killers are a very talented band and the album is well worth its money.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I actually liked Waking the Fallen, it had a very unique sound and was still agressive.  <br /> <br />I was actually anticipating this album until I heard \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" and was like what the heck has Matt Shadows been smoking? It sounded like a theme song for a saturday morning cartoon. It got even worse with the next single \\"Trashed and Scattered.\\" His vocals sound like an old man again like they did on Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, and sound VERY cheesy and horrible. There's cursing thrown in for no apparent reason, and the lyrics are laughably corny and terrible. The instrumentals sound like watered down metal-punk, and the guitar tone has lost all the punch from overproduction.  <br /> <br />It almost sounds like Matt Shadows is trying to emulate Axl Rose and Freddy Mercury but fails miserably. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this disaster to anyone with good taste in Metal. If you are yearning for something that sounds like the terrible bastard child of Guns and Roses, Queen, and Bad Religion I suppose this album's for you.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This is a great cd, what else could be expected from Lamb of God. I do not find it to be as good as there newer cd Ashes of the Wake. But it is still a great cd to own and listen to. Its great to buy a cd like this and see how lamb of god has progressed in there sound. It is a purchase that no one will regreat if they are into this type of  metal.
0393038912|3.0|The author's biases are showing, and they detract from a good, thorough treatment of a broad and challenging review of the course of human history.  While the content is thought provoking and often interestingly portrayed, by the end of the book I could not escape concluding that Dr. Diamond's tremendous amount of time spent afield in New Guinea has warped his ability to provide a balanced analysis of modern civilization.  Thematically, the work lapses into excessive rationalizations of the reasons for the variability of technological development amongst societies.  It is burdened by anecdote rather than analytic science (e.g. the author's assertion that today's hunter-gatherers are more intelligent than members of technologically advanced societies), and the aforementioned excess bias.  Perhaps nothing better illustrates this last than Diamond's perjorative description of all societies beyond tribes as \\"kleptocracies\\".
B0002S94OS|5.0|There are not many albums where you can say that every song on the album is great. This is one of those rare albums. Ashes of the Wake is one of the best albums I have heard in along time. Its the type of album where you become addicted to a couple songs at first, but as you listen to it more and more you realize that it has alot to offer. From start to finish this is a fantastic cd.  <br /> <br />Lamb of god has become one of my favorite bands because of how solid this album is. It is rare for me to like a cd for along period of time, because when I get a new cd I listen to it to death. But this is a cd that continually makes its way out of my cd book, every time I think I am done with it. Due to how great of a album it is.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The most striking thing for me about the film is its wonderful animation. The settings, movements and expressions have a rare level of beauty, detail, realism and subtlety. The story itself is quite enchanting, seen through the eyes of a child. It represents the power of courage, kindness, love and respectfulness. I didn't get the part about the dragons. I don't know what they represent to the Chinese and Japanese but never mind. It's a great story.
0792838068|4.0|This movie paints a great potrait of an extreme alcholic. It is the type of movie that you watch and think about the rest of the day. It leaves you shocked and horrified for the character that cage plays. This movie works on so many levels. Its a great drama, and if your alittle twisted like myself you will find cage's character funny as hell at times, with his drunken antics. And needless to say elziableth shue gets topless. For goodness sakes she was in coctails. And now naked, what else could you want. A great movie, the girl from coctails topless, and a insane drunk. It has all the makings of a masterpiece.
B00005MAM2|5.0|YES this version is different from the original Streamline release.  YES it has different voices and dialogue.  and YES, it IS better for it.  the original translators butchered the script, often with hilarious results, with dialogue that often didn't make any sense, thus rendering the story almost beyond understanding.  don't get me wrong, i will always cherish my original VHS.  that's what got me into anime to begin with.  but the fact is, it was obviously done with serious budget constraints and did not get the care and attention it deserved.<br /><br />with the new version, however, the team went back to the original script and re-translated the dialogue to more accurately reflect Otomo's vision.  the is clearly documented on the bonus disc.  the story is now more understandable, and the \\"wtf?\\" bits of dialogue have been replaced with that which makes sense.<br /><br />an example of this is Kaneda'a original \\"just when my coils were reaching the green line\\".  this has changed to the more accurate \\"just when my motor coils were getting warmed up\\".  what was also incorrect in the original is in the scene after the gang is arrested when the man pulls a grenade.  in the original, the gang sounds like they are defending the would-be suicide bomber (\\"what are you gonna do, hang 'em?\\").  what they were actually doing, as is seen in the new release, is berating the man for his stupidity in endangering them all (\\"next time why don't you just hang yourself!\\").<br /><br />as for those who bash the movie because \\"it's not Disney'!!!  you are just morons.  the movie was NEVER intended to be viewed by children.  it is an adult feature film.  the japanese don't just make movies for kids.  animation is the major form of cinematic entertainment in japan.  don't be an ill-informed ignoramous.<br /><br />all in all, the new release is superior.  again, i will always cherish my VHS, if only for it's blatent campy dialogue and for obvious sentimental reasons.  but for viewing pleasure, it's the new release all the way.he way.
B00005JMYI|4.0|All you need to know is that will ferrel and vince vaughn are in another film together. I consider them the two funniest bastards alive. There work together in old school was above and beyond anything any of us could have hoped and prayed for. And now they take there comedic genius to anchorman. Which is not as funny as oldschool (what is) but is pretty damn funny in its own right. The movie is unbelievably funny all the way to the very end where I find it falls alittle short. But that does not take away from all the humor that came before the end. The movie is very entertaining and is definitly worth the purchase. And furthermore if you call yourself a will ferrell fan I don't see how you can not purchase it. Its not like its elf.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|The theory of chaos is a very passionate subject. Right between your eyes a little twist of the state of the things can make affect an entire life: yours or another one. It's a big puzzle where the lines are intersected by minuscule connections as a whole nervous system: even the maxim disorder has its own pattern. If you wish to turn back any little piece of this complex and unexpected mechanism ruled by capricious laws you can open Pandora's box.<br /><br />How many possible resolutions may an event have? . That's why the history can not accept such coin in this values' market. You rearrange a little detail and the whole destiny changes suddenly before your eyes. It's like make possible scenarios inside an unknown future. You can control and even reduce your weakness and increase your strengths, but the rest of the uncertainness is still dark. What about with the menaces and opportunities: these are variables which live outside your control. You can not handle them.<br /><br />Interesting and very well built script that leaves you thinking: you can not alter a fact to rescue a destiny without avoiding worst or better consequences derived from the best of your goodwill.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The obscure world of insomnia dilutes the life of protagonist Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) whose very existence seems to slowly fade into nothingness.  His is an existence where sleeplessness, melancholy, and loneliness seem to rule, and his appearance supports this notion that gives the impression of either being a victim of the Nazi concentrations camps, or a dope fiend.  It is painful to watch the skinniness of Trevor when he dresses himself or moves around without a shirt.  His bones protrude his skin in such a manner that it is almost possible to use him for a skeletal anatomy lesson.  Trevor writes down his continual weight loss on small notes that he places on the wall while it becomes possible to see his weight loss.  A prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whom he frequently visits even tells him that if he would be any thinner he would not exist.<br /><br />In the opening scene Trevor rolls up a carpet with much difficulty while a pair of feet stick out the end of the carpet.  After he has rolled up the carpet Trevor walks up to the window where a close up of him confirms that he has gone through some physical abuse.  He drives off to some remote location on the seaside with the carpet in the back of his pickup truck.  There he prepares himself to throw the carpet into the sea when a stranger who asks him, \\"Who are you\\", interrupts him.  Later at home Trevor washes his hands in bleach while the camera angle from the bedroom reveals a flashlight on the bed.  It looks like the flashlight that the stranger might have used a scene earlier.<br /><br />Trevor is a machinist at a small factory.  It is a dirty, greasy, and dangerous job, but his foreman does not seem to care when he only continues to urge them to work harder and faster.  The camaraderie is close between the workers who frequently play poker together, or tell each other jokes to liven up the atmosphere.  However, Trevor always avoids his coworkers even when they ask him to join them for poker, as he always has other plans.  His plans consist of three things while struggling with his yearlong insomnia.  Trevor frequently visits the call girl Stevie, which was already mentioned, and he spends his late nights at an airport cafeteria to drink coffee and talk to the waitress that works the graveyard shift, but he always leaves at 1:30 AM.  The rest of the time he spends at home where he reads and watches TV, as he endures the power of his insomnia.  One of the novels that he read is Fyodor Dostoevski's The Idiot.<br /><br />Eventually things begin to catch up with Trevor.  It all starts when he meets Ivan (John Sharian) during one of his breaks after a troublesome meeting with his boss.  On a later occasion, Ivan distracts him when he is supposed to help one of his coworkers who ends up in a severe accident.  Consequently, the plot begin to thicken, as Trevor's coworkers express their contempt for him, Ivan continues to put him in danger, and someone leaves a secret code in form of hangman on his refrigerator.  Amidst the hazy consciousness Trevor begin to feel the affects of his sleep deprivation while he also feels that someone is on his tail.  The question is who and why is someone following him, as his life begins to get more and more muddled by continuing complex problems.<br /><br />The Machinist presents an intriguing tale where the main character finds himself in a paranoid world and the twilights of insomnia grab his awareness.  The director Brad Anderson provides a stunning effort framing several of the scenes in wonderful compositions enhanced with the cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez and Charlie Jiminez.  These three filmmakers succeed in a brilliant way to capture the perception of Trevor, as he finds himself in a complicated situation.  Another captivating facet of the film emerges through the mise-en-scene, which offers much detail to what takes place in the story.  Lastly, the performance by Christian Bale is tremendous who went through a rough diet to perform the part, as he lost some 60 pounds.  Altogether, the Machinist will keep the audience in thoughts while the ominous world of Trevor comes into sight, which will leave them thinking for some time after the film.ough a rough diet to perform the part, as he lost some 60 pounds.  Altogether, the Machinist will keep the audience in thoughts while the ominous world of Trevor comes into sight, which will leave them thinking for some time after the film.
B00005ABKC|5.0|\\"Hard Promises,\\" in my opinion, refers to the tough task TP&HBs had in following the greatness (artistic and commercial) of \\"Damn The Torpedoes.\\"  They completely made good on that \\"promise\\" with this record.  I personally like \\"Hard\\" more than \\"Damn,\\" which may only be because it received slightly less overkill/exposure when it was released.  Both are absolutely outstanding.  Back in the day when bands were allowed (by their record companies) to develop their sound over the course of a few albums, greatness was often born.  That is the case here.  \\"Damn\\" marked the beginning of their peak creativity, and \\"Hard\\" found them calmly enjoying the view from the top.  Most bands quickly slide downhill after they peak, but TP&HBs mananged to remain there for this album and then slowly (very slowly) \\"descended.\\"  Over the years they've managed to hit other career peaks as well but never as naturally and confidently as on \\"Hard Promises.\\"
0783117523|4.0|This is a terrific movie and I was thrilled to see Angelina Jolie playing this part, (I first saw her in Hackers). But in case you don't know this, the DVD is missing 6 minutes of the movie. the only way to have the extra 6 minutes is to have gotten the original release on VHS (or recorded in from HBO). After Angelina became more popular, 6 minutes of her nude scenes were deleted from later re-releases of the movie including this DVD. But it still is a good movie.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Though large chunks of the \\"Collateral\\" plot are preposterous, taken with a pinch of salt and tongue in cheek, it's a highly entertaining thrill ride through the streets of Los Angeles, while cab driver Jamie Foxx is taken hostage by sociopath hit man Tom Cruise. Foxx spends the night from hell as Cruise uses his cab for \\"work,\\" and tries to find a way out of his predicament.<br />The film looks great, with lots of dazzling overhead shots of a bright lights and glitter LA, and it sounds good too, with a score by James Newton Howard, and some pleasant non-original music. There are many moments of humor with some witty lines between the two leads, who have a marvelous \\"anti-chemistry\\" between them, and director Michael Mann keeps the pace so fast, that as we zip from scene to scene, we don't fully realize how absurd the story is.<br /><br />The cast is excellent; Cruise with gray hair and beard is in one of his best recent roles, and portrays the sadistic Vincent with a cool and cutting edge, and Foxx is terrific as the beleaguered cabbie Max. Both are in peak athletic shape, and do their share of some fast running. Jada Pinkett Smith is beautiful as a prosecuting attorney, but it is a thankless role, and she is not much more than a plot device. Others in the cast include Spanish actor (and new international star) Javier Bardem in a small part as Felix, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning, and Peter Berg as Weidner.<br />Put reasoning on hold, and you'll enjoy this splashy thriller, and what is ultimately a bizarre \\"buddy film.\\"<br />Total running time is 120 minutes.
B00005JGAB|5.0|First, i hated most punk, (i don't consider RCHP punk- even BSSM- 'cause they're more funk and regular rock) because it promoted stupid politics by undergraduates and most fans hated u2 without even listening to their energetic debut \\"boy\\". When listening to this album, everything that i was used to listening to was missing. There was no skilled production, no expensive guitars, and no robert plant (led zeppelin). Instead there were simplistic, repetative beats, and a bunch of New Yorkers with Faux- English accents. I thought to myself after only picking it from the store shelf (i should have gotten \\"Stiucky Fingers\\"- Rolling Stones). However, when i listened to this, i was gald i got this instead. The simplicity did not kill the songs, but in fact, made the songs even better. The fake english accent helps when singing songs like the first two tracks i'm tooo lazy to mention, Chainsaw, and just every freakin' little original track on the  album. In fact, the songs are meant to go together. Whats original with this group is that their not really that anarchist DESTROY stuff that i usually assiociate punk with, they're just low budget. They may have \\"Now I Want To Sniff Some Glue\\" or  gang violence in \\"50 3rd and 3rd,\\" and the drive by in Blitzreig Bop but they also have the love song \\"i wanna be your boyfriend\\" or  \\"listen to my heart.\\" However, I still have one more note on the fake english accent by joey. by listening to other songs on other albums it seemed ruined by overdubbing.this band is also an influence for u2, and i don't mean stereotypically u2, i mean early u2. This is an instant classic, and if you like rock in general, you're probably going to like this. This is not only \\"punk\\", but classic rock stripped of all its material excess.

This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)<br /><br />I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down.

B000059R8Y|3.0|Some people like the sensitive balladeer that Eric Clapton has become in later years. Some like his low-key 70s amalgams of rock, pop, blues, and country. Some liked him as a gritty bluesman. And the first two groups will certainly be the ones most satisfied by \\"Reptile\\", his 2001 release. <br /> <br />Clapton has dug up some really obscure oldies, he covers a couple of slightly more familiar songs by Ray Charles, J.J. Cale and Stevie Wonder, and he has penned a few himself as well. And a few of them are really good...he performs well on a fine rendition of an old Big Joe Turner-recording, the tough, bluesy R&B of \\"Got You On My Mind\\", and plays some nice slide guitar as well. <br />This take on Ray Charles' \\"Come Back Baby\\" is equally good, and the former \\"God\\" lays down a pretty decent version of the ancient \\"I Want A Little Girl\\", which has been recorded by everybody from Louis Armstrong to T-Bone Walker. And the pleasant AOR trifle \\"Superman Inside\\" is okay, too. <br /> <br />And that's about it, really. Not that the remaining eight songs and two instrumentals are terrible, they're just sort of bland...the kind of songs that you won't be able to recall once they've finished. No memorable hooks, lyrics, riffs, instrumental passages, anything. Even Clapton's covers of tunes by James Taylor and J.J. Cale are boring, and there are too many \\"Pilgrim\\"-like ballads and nondescript acoustic shuffles here. <br /> <br />\\"Reptile\\" is definitely one of the minor items in the Clapton catalogue, and it is truly amazing to hear people state that Eric Clapton plays the blues on this album. Do they know what blues is, or do they just assume that when it's Eric Clapton, well, then it must be the blues? <br />Don't get your hopes up. His self-penned material hasn't even remotely resembled blues for some fifteen years, and this doesn't either. <br />2 1/2 stars. Pretty forgettable.
0670033375|4.0|the width and depth of Prof. Diamond's knowledge is truely amazing! At the same time, this book is a refreshing disgression from the usual (at least in Germany, my home) \\"tree huggers'\\" attitude of sorting all people into \\"good\\" ones (who support their agenda), and \\"bad\\" ones (who do not). Instead, he argues, that incentives guide people's behaviour, and if they are set wrong -and this can happen without any bad intentions!- the results may be desastrous. <br /> <br />The only problem, I have with this superb book, as compared to, say, Guns, Germs and Steel by the same author is that it is too long winded at times. 100 pages less, and it would have been perfect!
B000002U94|5.0|\\"Nine Tonight\\" is a mixture of R&B, rock n' roll and, well, pop, with some really catchy shout-along songs and a few good guitar and saxophone solos as well. Bob Seger was still at his peak when this album was recorded, and while some of the songs may be slight, the overall quality of this material is very high and it barely dips at all along the way.    \\"Nine Tonight\\" mixes a few hard rock tunes (\\"Nine Tonight\\", \\"Feel Like A Number\\", \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight), three or four ballads (\\"Against The Wind\\", \\"We've Got Tonight\\", \\"Mainstreet\\"), and a good handful of mid-tempo rockers. Highlights include a great rendition of the funky \\"Tryin' To Live My Life Without You\\", the simple but melodic \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me\\", and the raunchy \\"The Fire Down Below\\", and while \\"Nine Tonight\\" may not be the most original rock album ever, it is a real good-time record, filled with good tunes, good singing, good playing and good arrangements.    The sound is very good, too, and \\"Nine Tonight\\" has a nice concert \\"feel\\" to it.  If you like Bob Seger, you'll like \\"Nine Tonight\\". And if you don't know too much about him, this is a good place to start - better than \\"Greatest Hits\\", since most of the songs have more nerve and power in this live setting.   To me, this is the best and most consistent album Seger has ever made. And yes, I have \\"Live Bullet\\" as well.  Very highly recommended!
B0000DG00B|5.0|Having grown up in the south and following ABB around for most of my youth, I can say that this is ABB at their best.  I remember both sets fondly....well...those parts that I CAN remember!!  The weekend was complete havoc, but the musical moments are still burned into my memory 35 years later.  Duane and Betts were magic, plain and simple.  One thing that I remember but haven't seen mentioned anywhere is that not only Johnny Winter, but his brother Edgar jammed on stage with ABB that evening.  Can anyone that hasn't destroyed those brain cells please confirm? <br /> <br />Mark in Alabama (51 and still rockin')
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I bought this album after stumbling across Buble guesting on one of the late-night talk shows, where the musical artists are usually not of the genre I prefer...he simply stopped me in my tracks with his incredible voice. <br /> <br />The album is a delight -- well produced and no, he's not a Sinatra imitator. His own personal style shines through the familiar material, and it's a pleasure to relax and listen to really GOOD music being performed by a true artist. <br /> <br />We went to see him in concert a few weeks after buying the album. The show was fantastic; he's more impressive in person than on the recording, if you can imagine that. He has a large fan base of women of all ages...and I can understand that. While he doesn't do 'that' for ME...I am absolutely in awe of the instrument. This young man has a long, bright future ahead of him.
B0000508U6|4.0|I think this is Coldplays best album. As a whole it is better than Rush of blood to the head. Every song is good beside Spies which i really dont like.
B00005JLR2|5.0|My daughter loves this movie.  Why wasn't it a bigger success?  My guess is that the idea of \\"Treasure Island\\" has long lost it's luster with today's society.  Wonderfully scripted and animated.  To those who rate it poorly - watch it again as you would have as a child and you'd see that this really is one of Disney's best without Pixar.

B00005R87Q|2.0|The Fast and the Furious stars Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as a cop and criminal who form a friendship of sorts in the underground world of street racing.   <br /> <br />There isn't much of a plot to speak of.  Brian O'Conner (Walker) plays a cop who is going undercover to investigate a series of highway robberies carried out by souped-up Honda Civic drivers armed with little more than a harpoon and a tranquilizer gun.  Dominick Toretto (Diesel) is the ringleader of a particularly suspicious gang of misfits, even though Brian doesn't really believe that Toretto is the man responsible.   <br /> <br />With this simple setup, the movie takes us on a thrill ride of one car chase after another.  The one thing I can give this movie credit for is it's attention to a world that hasn't been covered by many other movies.  Even though I don't, for a minute, believe that hundreds of people can show up and race in the streets of Los Angeles without the cops showing up right away, once you get over this little problem, the setting is somewhat convincing.   <br /> <br />One other plot twist is the ongoing rivalry between Toretto and  Johnny Tran, a ruthless Asian gang leader who controls portions of the city.  Johnny is also a suspect in the hijacks.   <br /> <br />The only real common sense in the movie comes from O'Conner's superiors who are in the movie only to give a voice to the audience members who are saying \\"You're a cop!  Arrest somebody!\\"  O'Conner feels that all they have is circumstantial evidence, however, and not enough to convict Toretto or anyone else.  Also, he's sort of got a crush on Toretto's sister and nothing breaks up a quick romance like a girl finding out your life is one big lie and you're out to send her brother to prison.  Ahh, the conflict!   <br /> <br />One other aspect of the movie is the attention paid to the \\"tricked out\\" cars, of which there are plenty.  Any amateur gearheads out there who like working on their cars might get a kick out of seeingthese hopped up machines.  Personally, I fail to see the real value of sinking $10k-$20k into a Honda Civic, when you could get yourself a REAL sports car for much less money.     <br /> <br />At the end, the movie really amounts to basically the equivalent of sniffing gasoline.  Yeah, it's a cheap thrill and there are a lot of cool colors and flashes of light, but when you're done you feel slightly confused and repeat exposure to this kind of film will probably make you dumber in the long run.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The word 'popular' in popular music refers to the 'popularity' of an artist.  There are those, of course, that disdain (out of premise) any band that is popular.  Preferring, instead, to focus energies on up and coming bands.  The 'next big whomever'. <br /> <br />With Coldplay, today, they have reached the pinnacle of current popularity.  Moreover, they have weathered a 3 year gap between albums (in general, a death-knell for an average artist) by releasing X&Y to assured multi-national, multi-platinum success.   *That was even before the second song was heard*  (with Speed of Sound being released, everyone had a general idea that at least a .99$ purchase on iTunes was in order). <br /> <br />However, what about the rest of the album?  Could it begin the long-term vault between the here and now to the tomorrow and ad-infinitum level that Coldplay wants?  (their own stated goal for this album) <br /> <br />YES.   The answer is YES. <br /> <br />They have put into red-book audio form their part in insuring continuing popularity:  a stellar CD. <br /> <br />Pick a track (there are 13).  They're all Good.  Some (including Fix You, White Shadows, Speed of Sound) are great. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  an excellent CD.   <br /> <br />If you like Coldplay, buy it.  If you don't, buy it.
B000060P79|5.0|This is the better of SP's CDs.  Catchy tunes, good lyrics, LESS WHINING *ahem* (See my reveiw of the 2nd CD)    I'd Do Anything: An awesome teen anthem. 10/10    The Worst Day Ever: SHUT UP PIERRE!

0778321606|5.0|I picked this up as an \\"airport\\" read, expecting a bit of fluff. Instead, I was treated to a rich, deep, wonderful story worth savoring. By the half-way point, I couldn't put it down! I was surprised at how well the characters are drawn, and loved the interactions among them. I cried several times toward the end, from identifying with the characters. And after finishing, I wished it wasn't over - just because I was enjoying it so much. I'm really looking forward to the sequel _A Good Yarn_. <br /> <br />I don't often go out of my way to recommend books, but this one is worth it.
B000667FN8|4.0|Hey, I'm no music expert, but this stuff is good.  The first album by the Canadian pop-punk quintet is better.  Here, they seem ... depressed. <br />Here's a rundown: <br /> <br />Shut Up!: A good song.  Aimed at the media, thank God. 8/10 <br /> <br />Welcome to My Life:  Ah, depressing.  Now I feel sorry for you, Pierre.... oh, wait, NO I DON'T!!!!! 4/10 <br /> <br />Perfect World: Jesus Christ, take some Prozac and SHUT UP! Good song, though.    6/10 <br /> <br />Thank You: This is a good song (ever tried moshing to it?).  I know how he feels. 9?/10 <br /> <br />Me Against The World: Reminds me of Good Charlotte. 6/10 <br /> <br />Crazy: This song's okay.  Kind of weird though.... @_@ 7/10 <br /> <br />Jump:  Reminds me of Good Charlotte on Steroids with Sammy Hagar in the band. 8/10. <br /> <br />Everytime: One word: Ny-eeah 5/10 <br /> <br />Promise: You have GOT to be kidding me.  Don't make me laugh, Pierre, you're not good at it. 2/10 <br /> <br />One: A waste of time. *skips* 2/10 <br /> <br />Untitled: A bigger waste of time. 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, not the best thing ever.  Get the first album.  It's better.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|YES. IT`S TRUE... IS NOT HIS BEST WORK... BUT IS NOT SO BAD, MAYBE FRIENDS, NEED A FEW MORE TIME TO LISTEN IT BETTER.. GIVE IT A ONE MORE CHANCE.... JUST WAS A RUSH-FASTED PIECE... WE EXPECT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ECLECTIC... LIKE \\"LE ROI\\" OR \\"THE SCREEN\\"...ON HIS NEXT DELIVERY... BE OPTIMISTIC
B0006L16N8|5.0|Some albums and songs feel dated, but everything that occupies \\"X&Y\\" feels colossal and timeless. This album would hold up anywhere or anytime. You just have to buy it and listen to feel the true impact. I would highly recommend it.
B000001DTM|3.0|There are some incredible songs here, and some some lousy ones, but one thing troubles me throughout -- why is the production so fuzzy and tinny?  Maybe it's for effect, but I find it annoying. <br /> <br />Joshua Tree is better overall, but there are some terrific pieces here (zoo, one, cruel, mysterious ways, fly).  Ultraviolet has too many \\"Baby's\\" in it (Baby baby baby baby baby baby light my waaaay...).  Nearly all of this album is musically very interesting (except for the lousy production), but the vocals on some (love is blindess, ultraviolet, acrobat, throwin arms), really bug me;  they remind me of the insipid vocals on most of \\"Atomic Bomb.\\"
B0006L16N8|5.0|This CD manages to do what a lot of others can't, it ignites the imagination with all sorts of colors and hues. \\"X&Y\\" starts out with the powerful and triumphant \\"Square One.\\" From then on, you will absolutely remain breathless. In fact, I think they saved one of the best songs for almost last, \\"Twisted Logic.\\" The middle is stuffed with so much good stuff that it's very filling now matter how you stack it. This has to be one of the best albums released in a long time. I've bought many, but this one stands out in a very crowded and diluted field.
B0006399FS|1.0|Dismal. Dismal.  Dismal. <br /> <br />The lyrics and vocals are insipid, with the exceptions of Vertigo and All Because of You.
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"X&Y\\" is the best album I've heard this year. It's quite impressive and stunning. Let the haters hate, but I'm going to enjoy this great album. There's nothing else out there quite like it. There is something special about \\"X&Y.\\" The music and atmosphere are phenomenal. This album outshines AROBTTH by a dozen miles. This is one of the best albums ever made. Truly amazing.
6303184499|1.0|...and she's a pretty lousy actress to begin with, but you'd think that with her looks this movie would be somewhat bearable.<br /><br />Nope, this has got to be one of the single DUMBEST movies I've ever seen.  The plot is idiotic especially the ending, Sharon Stone has all of 2 or 3 rubber expressions on the whole time, the attempts at \\"steamy erotika\\" are a clumsy joke, both Stone and Baldwin phone in their high-school-drama-production performances...bleh!<br /><br />I was just glad that I rented not bought this total POS.
B000006TZ8|5.0|I must have seen these guys play at least a dozen times in New York City during their recording lifespan,and I think on all their tours, and always felt their energy,sophistication,song writing were an intelligent expression and outgrowth of the great UK 60's music going down..Heavily influenced and paying respects proudly to their heroes like the Kinks,Small Faces,Who...this Album pushed them ahead of the pack because there was a maturity here moving them forward from the strict mod induced sound they wore proudly..A feeling that the world was changing while putting out a great album of great songs.The cd Setting Sons should get equal merit.
1400049628|4.0|If you picked this book up at the store and thumbed through it, you'd probably conclude that it belongs in the \\"Humor\\" section of the bookstore and that it's a kind of parody of every dumb thing that victims in zombie horror movies always do. But once you actually start reading this thing, you realize it's not really funny, not in a laugh-out-loud way. The only joke in the whole thing is the meta-joke that the author takes zombie-preparedness so seriously. Rather than being the tongue-in-cheek lampoon that you probably expected, the book's tone is completely serious, with practical and well reasoned advice about how to survive a zombie attack, how to most effectively go on the offense against zombies, and how to escape from a zombie-infested area. The best way to describe it is probably as non-fiction set in a fictional world where zombies really do exist. <br /> <br />None of this is to say, however, that it isn't a good read. In fact, I was totally engrossed through the whole thing, thanks in no small part to how approachable the text was, even for such an outlandish topic. But even still, I can't really explain why I was so interested in hearing, for example, about how best to hole up in your house to survive an undead siege (tip: take all your supplies to the top floor then demolish the stairs --zombies can't climb). But I was. I've never read anything so absurd and rational at the same time.
B000005S31|5.0|This one was hailed as a comeback by many critics..in truth,Lou never left. The fact that he never is considered some milestone artist like those that made a Sgt.Pepper,Let It Bleed, Pet Sounds or Blonde On Blonde, as a defining statement does not detract from his historical greatness nor does it  distract from so many great songs that are usually found on all his albums...The closest to the above mentioned masterpiece albums is his Berlin,Transformer,and maybe New York... Berlin a lush feel of beauty throughout was a stark contrast to the brightness and shimmer of the Bowieesqe Transformer..New York has it's great moments as well..and so does Rock n Roll Animal.. I mean that Intro/Sweet Jane is a rare thing...Coney Island Baby on the other hand is crisp,commercial and fresh. I have the original RCA USA CD release and it chimes..not deep, but just a bunch of solid songs played by Lou's usual great musicians..fun and uncomplicated despite the autobiography of Coney Island Baby and the rush of Kicks...looking back, I remember how New York's WNEW FM pumped OOOHHH BABY out...and a smile comes to all when listening to the song A Gift ...
B000002ADT|5.0|If you love classic jazz or just want a high class introduction into the world of jazz, buy this album. If you want a soothing yet mentally stimulating ride after a long day's work, buy this album!! Such a tight sound and a smooth groove from the legends. A trumpet sound that even a saxophonist like myself loves! And to think I found this CD in a throw away box at my dumpster!! But it is definitely worth buying from Amazon!!
B000805796|5.0|I love their song Next Best Superstar, which has a message which passes all the artists that arrive strong to the music's world, its style Rock is really good I wait this Cd it arrives soon to colombia, because the truth is really good.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Fashions come and go.  A broken clock is right twice a day.  Pick a cliche.  It is difficult in this day of \\"post punk\\", \\"post rock\\", teen idols and an American media market dominated by hip hop for a Progressive metal band to gain a solid footing.  Change too much and you are labeled a sell out and loose your fan base.  Stick to your \\"sound\\" and you're accused of getting stale.  That said, this is a good, solid album for a band with tremedous range and virtuosity who have never been fully appreciated for the level of talent they present.  How many bands come and go and never aspire too anything more than a brief brush with fame only to become a radio trivia question.  The body of work they offer is broad and represents some of the best that their peers - Queensryche, Fates Warning, etc.  offered.  The rest of the world still appreciates the complexity and sheer operatic adrenalyne rush of great progressive rock and metal.  These guys are still the standard bearers for that genre, which is in relative radio and sales hibernation here in the U.S.  Hopefully, the clock will be right again soon.  I am setting my watch.  Highly Recommended.
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"X&Y\\" could have easily been Coldplay's greatest hits album. There are so many memorable songs like SQUARE ONE, WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, FIX YOU, TALK, SPEED OF SOUND, LOW, A MESSAGE, HARDEST PART and TWISTED LOGIC. Any number of songs from \\"X&Y\\" would collectively qualify them as being better than AROBTTH. \\"X&Y is a stand alone master work. Really, it doesn't need to be compared to other Coldplay previous works. It operated on the strength of it's own material. It is something new, something better. Same Coldplay, but a more ambitious and eager band has shown up this time. I think the songs on \\"X&Y\\" have a higher degree of difficulty. They're performed and executed flawlessly. I can tell that this album was challenging, but they pulled it off. This was hard.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is so awesome and a breath of fresh air. Thank God for Coldplay. I love everything about this CD. It's just a good, solid, Rock album. I'm a new Coldplay fan and this album makes my admiration and respect from them grow even deeper. \\"X&Y\\" is both amazing and spectacular. This CD is for anyone that truly loves great Rock music.

B0002KVULG|4.0|Even after several repeated viewings, I find this stylish adaptation of the classic vampire legend one of my favorites.  Based not on Bram Stoker's novel, but the stage play in which Frank Langella also appeared as the evil count, the movie's atmospheric settings and John Williams' beautifully done score compliment John Badham's film quite nicely.  Langella is one of the most handsome actors to play the role and it is his smooth elegance and smoldering sensuality that gives DRACULA its bite.  Kate Nelligan is a stunning Lucy, a victim whose willingness to succumb is quite different.  Sir Laurence Olivier was ill when he filmed this movie, but his Van Helsing is appropriately heroic and his fate unexpected.  Donald Pleasance is gluttonishly charming as Lucy's father; Jan Francis makes a naive Mina; Trevor Eve is the stuffy Jonathan Harker; and Tony Haygarth as Renfield is super.  Although not faithful to the classic novel, this DRACULA nonetheless stands as one of the best adaptations of the well worn vampire.
B00097A5I6|3.0|i love reading through online reviews and see how one can critique an album to death or praise it as perfection. then i try to come up with some kind of middle ground, with this album... i can honestly say, i can't find any. <br /> <br />  \\"DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH\\", the latest effort by quintessential rock band OASIS is puzzling me. My background on Oasis is that they've always been there, in my early preteen years with Definately Maybe, continuing on with What's the STory... i couldn't have cared less about this band. They were what now has been replaced by Coldplay. Full-on Mainstream Rock. (not that there is a problem with that). Rock is all about freedom, and i fell in love with Oasis during they're late 90's early 2000's era with a dual punch of what's in my opinion their greatest efforts to date, STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS and HEATHEN CHEMISTRY,  with Heathen Chemistry standing out as one of the best pieces of rock/pop perfection. Oddly enough, i heard nothing but scathing reviews of it... to this i'm shocked and surprised, as most fans felt that those albums were reminiscent of a \\"sophomore slump\\" albeit more expansive (come into my world and imagine their first 3 albums as their debut stage, and then SOTSOF and HC as their sophomore stage, and now their newest effort is a Junior effort).   <br /> <br />  Ok, this newest album has me feeling like i bought it just to keep giving them my support, kind of in the way Red Sox fans always bought season tickets for 80+years because they wanted to support their team cause they \\"believed in them\\". I'm not sure how to put it, but simply i think this album is bad. i've listened to it maybe 5 times now, and its just not good. I can't compare it to their old stuff, so its not too regressive, yet, its not pushing the envelope like their last two albums. I dunno.... In a way i can compare it to NIN's newest album. Its a let down in a way, even though its good.  <br /> <br /> Basically i bought three albums the sameday, Oasis' DON\\"T BELIEVE THE TRUTH, ELECTRIC SIX'S' \\"SENOR SMOKE\\", and THE WHITE STRIPES' \\"GET BEHIND ME SATAN\\"   and oddly enough if you had asked me 3 years ago which band would i like more in 3 years, i woulda laughed at you for telling me it would've been the White Stripes. Jack and Meg's last efforts where pathetic, yet their newest album is great. and i'm almost depressed that Liam and Noel couldn't follow up Heathen Chemistry. <br /> <br /> One more thing. Liam's writing was one of the greatest things about their last two albums... i think his songs are exponentially better than NOEL's. and Liam's songs are still better than NOELS, GUESS GOD THINKS I'M ABEL has to be the best song on here.  <br /> <br />If you're a die hard oasis fan, you know you'll get this album. I have it. I love the band, but i'd dare say i think i hate this one. If you're just looking for a good old rock and roll album, go get the new White Stripes instead.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I was so impressed with Reese Witherspoon's breakout role in a little film called MAN IN THE MOON.  It seemed she was destined for great things, and even though LEGALLY BLONDE is nothing more than a wisp of a movie, Reese's radiance carries the movie and makes it a highly enjoyable diversion.  She plays a somewhat ditzy blonde whose snobby boyfriend (an effective Matthew Davis) breaks up with her as he prepares to enter Harvard.  She decides to show him she's not so dumb and manages to get into Harvard's law school herself.  She meets a handsome law professor (Luke Wilson), and finds herself favored by the program's chief (Victor Garber), and also confronted with Davis' new love (Selma Blair).  Holland Taylor is very good as Reese's mentor professor and the whole thing is as predictable as day and night, but it's a showcase for Reese, who ends up defending an aerobics instructor (Ali Larter) in the murder case of her wealthy husband.  The film has some wonderful comic moments and it spawned a sequel.  I enjoyed its lightheartedness and Witherspoon's appeal.
B00005JKOI|5.0|Ok so I wanted to clear some things up here because I've seen pretty in pink a thousand times and many of you are confused about steph. You asked why does steph chase molly ringwald if he despises people who arent richie countryclub snot teens like him. Because although he is a snob he wanted molly ringwald. Remember at the beginning when he approached her at her car and said I'VE LIKED YOU FOR YEARS HOW COME WE NEVER WENT OUT\\" And then blane comes along and dates her. Steph gives him a hard time because she rejected him and went for his best friend. Wouldn't you be upset? And at the end, blane said to steph, she thinks your sh*t and deep down you know she's right. You buy everything and you couldnt buy her that's why you're upset. And after steph's party when he threatened to end his friendship with blane if he continued dating ringwald and said that if money was even an issue would he treat his parents house like that. He was telling the truth. It had nothing to do with ringwald being on the other side of the tracks, it was because he liked her and she didnt feel the same, and blane ended up with her. Next, even though it does sound confusing that duckie cant get into a club with andy (ringwald) when he fell behind in high school you'd think that would make him older than her, but it depends on how early you started pre-school or if you went straight to kindergarden. Some seniors are 16 years old but most are 18, and some are 17. But it's just a movie. Any other questions. Don't pay attention to the questionaire guy that's his opinion nothing more. I had no idea andy's best friend (the blonde) died during the making of pretty in pink, so it never occured to me as being strange when suddenly the store clerk lady became andy's new best friend, i just thought she had more than one friend. So they did a nice job of covering that gap up. And that's a sad thing that she died young and beautiful.
B00004XPPB|4.0|DONNIE BRASCO is a highly accurate and in depth look at the complexities involved in undercover police work.  Based on the true story of Joe Pistone, BRASCO gives us an excellent cast, headed by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, in showing us the underworld of the Mafia through the eyes of the guys on the lower end of the stick.  Depp in his undercover role as a wiseguy to Pacino, endangers his married life (Anne Heche in a strong performance), and finds himself becoming attached to Pacino, in spite of what he knows is going to happen in the future.  Michael Madsen gives one of his best performances as Johnny Black, a mover who wants to take Depp away from Pacino.  The film's complexities question Depp's role, especially when he tries to get Pacino to get out of the picture.  Pacino is brilliant and manages to make a guy who has killed over 25 people sympathetic, and Depp is amazing in this unusual role, giving Brasco the audience's compassion in his role of the betrayer.  A fine gangster film well directed by Mike Newell.
0553565915|1.0|Review of Embraced by the Light by Betty J. Eadie, \\"The Most Profound and Complete Near-Death Experience Ever.\\" 1992, Gold Leaf Press. Hardback, 147 pages. ISBN: 1-882723-00-7<br /><br />I chose this book because I'd read it, and decided to give it another chance. I am left with the same conflicted views with my second (and last) reading as with my first. There seem to be contradictions in her story.<br /><br />It's not the message that is creating controversy; it is the method by which she delivers the message. Although a review on the book jacket says it's \\"well-crafted\\" I found her style flat and without literary prose. The details of her experience seem to be unfathomable fiction. In regards to the sub-title, how does one know that Eadie's is \\"the most profound and complete near-death experience ever?\\" Who is measuring profundity and completeness, and what measuring instruments do they use? Is it profound and complete because the publisher says so in order to make this a best seller? A book becomes a best seller based on the numbers sold, not on writing merit. The marketing team for this book got carried away with their claims.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Eadie recalls a near-death experience she had when she was a child. The simplicity of this story is more believable than the detailed near death experience she had as an adult.<br /><br />Betty Eadie is a thirty-one year old mother of seven who is hospitalized for a partial hysterectomy. The noontime operation goes smoothly, and at nine o'clock p.m. she's given a sleeping pill. Eadie experiences herself \\"above the bed, hovering near the ceiling.\\" Then, three men in robes tell her that she \\"had died prematurely.\\" Eadie claims to have transported herself home; she sees her husband and children at the house, while she's in the hospital. Eadie writes about a tunnel to tranquility. Eadie goes to the other side. She stands in front of a council of twelve men, sees people weaving on \\"large, ancient-looking looms,\\" and enters a \\"library of the mind\\" without books. She experiences Jesus, who tells her that her death is premature. She learns that she is on earth for a special mission, but she is not to know what it is.<br /><br />She writes: \\"When I returned to my mortal body, I felt cheated when I was unable to remember the details of this experience, but with the passage of time I have learned that I needed this forgetfulness for my own good.\\" She also remembers what she says she forgot when she writes that upon her return to her body at two o'clock in the morning five \\"creatures of the most hideous and grotesque appearance imaginable\\" entered her hospital room's doorway. They were there to kill her, but the monks, her \\"adoring angels,\\" appeared to save the day. Perhaps the pill was causing nightmares.<br /><br />Eadie tells us that she learned that \\"We are here to help each other, to care for each other, to understand, forgive, and serve one another.\\" She shares more of these enlightenments throughout her tale. I would have preferred a straightforward method of acquiring these revelations without the science fiction fable of Eadie's alleged near-death experience.<br />review by Lynn C.

0765310015|5.0|Robert Jordan was good, although his latest book leaves A LOT to be desired.  George R.R. Martin is great, but Steven Erikson has created the best Epic fantasy series available.  This isn't your normal young boy saves the world fantasy.  A world is created that is extremely vast in scope.  I just finished book 5 and there are still key characters being introduced.  The characters are deep, but he doesn't go into them to the point that there is no mystery left to them.  No one is all good or all evil, the characters are too real for that.  The world has it's own history which is unknown by most people in the world.  Civilizations have been created and destroyed countless times.  Some immortals have lived to see all or most of it, but most of them are not the talkative type.  Gods and mortals many times work together and against each other in the same realm.  I can't say enough about this series.  If you are looking for a romance, this IS NOT the series for you.  If you are a fan of epic fantasy you HAVE to read this series.  When I read George R.R. Martin I thought it could not get any better, with Steven Erikson it has.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trenr Reznor has a gift for illiciting from his listeners an intense passion and fury, making our souls vibrate with a conglomeration of raw guitars, synthesized drums, and guttural screams.   <br /> <br />With Teeth, however, defies the synthesized parts and recruits Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana fame, which brings an extremely live and athletic feel to the tracks.   <br /> <br />One thing that seems to be missing though is the core of Reznor's raw emotion.  As he has grown older, I imagine that his fiery soul has mellowed with age.  What felt real and true in Pretty Hate Machine and in songs like \\"Hurt\\" from The Downward Spiral, now seems painted on. Or maybe it's the fact that I've grown up and don't feel Reznor's pain reverberating in my formerly angst ridden teenage world.  Parenthood does that to you. <br /> <br />But the album from start to finish still rocks, and I can play it from beginning to end without need to skip songs.  That in and of itself makes it go from what is musically a 4 star album to 5 stars! <br /> <br />The best tracks, for me, are: <br />\\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" <br />\\"Love is Not Enough\\" <br />\\"With Teeth\\" <br />\\"The Hand that Feeds\\" <br />\\"Only\\"

B00006IU73|5.0|A chilling story, a choky atmosphere, a vague concept,  a timeless masterpiece. <br /> <br />I got a chance to know Porcupine Tree thanks to my favorite Scandinavian band Opeth. I didn't understand how a well-defined Death metal band was mannaged to make their music more like prograssive rock. Then I got to know it is because of Steven Wilson, the front man of Porcupine Tree, who is also the producer of Opeth, working with them to generate the masterpieces such as \\"Blackwater park\\" and \\"Damnation\\". When I first heard the music from Porcupine Tree, I was puzzled, what the hell? Some part of the atmosphere and the piano work are just so much like those of Opeth's. Well, maybe this makes PT easier to hook on me. <br /> <br />This is a concept album, like most of the prograssive rock. The chilling tale is about a child growing up and becoming a serial killer. This theme makes the album musicaly and atomspherically dark. Some of the songs sound very heavy, like the open track \\"blackest eyes\\", \\"wedding nail\\", \\"the creator has a mastertape\\" and \\"Strip the soul\\". The solid live drum and electronic guitar provide a powerful emotion, stronge and deep, sometimes alittle odd. However those energatic pieces can take a drastic turn to haunting melodies in a min. Tracks like \\"lips of ashes\\",\\"gravity eyelids\\", \\"heartattack in a layby\\" and \\"collapse the light into earth\\" are just so breathtaking and heartbroken that can almost bring one into tears. The angelic vocal of Steven Wilson is in well harmony with variaty of instruments and the sound made by the band to create resplendent moments through out the entire album.  <br /> <br />It contains almost everything one can expect from prograssive rock. Not like those easy listening music, this album need listeners to really sit down, take a deep breath, and fall into the atomsphere with the music. The process of listening to it and get one's own perception of it is like watching a well made movie. Your emotion is going up and down withthe spining of the disk. At some occasions you might feel the fear in the dark, and at some other moments you would find yourself weeping. It is really hard to express the true feeling when experiencing this album, so one has to hear it to feel it and to believe it. <br />
0385513755|5.0|With an open mind and willingness to see and accept beyond what is considered the standard way of life, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has opened new ground.<br /><br />Am I saying \\"ALL\\" of what was written in the book is an absolute 100% fact??? No, but a lot of it does have the ringing of truth to it. You can't help but question all the discrepencies the author has put forth and want to know the truth. I guess it all really depends on how open the person is and how serious they are to find the real truth. But, make no mistake, the clues and discrepencies are all there which leads to the, oh, so many questions.<br /><br />For example, the questions as to how the church really began and sustained for all those centuries is a major question. Maybe no one really wants those questions answered, but a lot of us do even if you don't like the answers. Once again, open your mind to the possibilities.<br /><br />Also, the true origin of the bible leaves a lot of questions behind and only a confident, open minded person will see the truth behind what we, as a society, have been force fed since birth. Just look. Did God really, from heaven, fax us a copy of the one true bible??? No, I guess not, and the author does an excellent job explaining the manipulation and deceit of people in power who are trying to stay in power through religion.<br /><br />Dan Brown has taken all these mysteries and questions and ran with it. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a fantastic book. Very deep. Very enlightening. Very thrilling. Very moving.<br /><br />Close minded people may say the book is horrid, evil, heretic... etc, but it isn't. THE BOOK IS AN EYE OPENER IF YOU AREN'T AFRAID TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY THERE.<br /><br />I am reminded a lot of the fantastic book \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" and the battle between between christianity and the nature/pagan religion.<br /><br />Take a moment and read \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and see if anything at all makes you question what you already believe to be true. If so, then Mr. Brown has done his job.Mr. Brown has done his job.
B00004TDRD|5.0|In 1975, Steven Spielberg had taken Peter Benchley's novel entitled, JAWS, and made it the one motion picture that will continue to be one of the best films in all of Horror/Suspense history.  <br /> <br />The residents of AMITY ISLAND, NEW YORK are quite happy. They live on an island complete with a beautiful beach. Some of the young residents have a party on the beach. Two of those kids, a male resident, and a girl named, CHRISSY WATKINS (played by Susan Backlinie) leave the party to go swimming. As Chrissy strips down to being completely nude and swims off into the ocean, the guy passes out on the beach. She swims around, but she suddenly feels some pain on her legs. She screams as this unknown thing attacks her and finally kills her. What killed her was a great white shark.  <br /> <br />MARTIN BRODY (played by Roy Scheider), Amity Island's chief of police resides, obviously, in Amity Island with his beautiful wife, ELLEN BRODY (played by Lorraine Gary) and his two sons, MICHAEL (played by Chris Rebello) and SEAN (played by Jay Mello), where a few months ago, they had moved to Amity Island from New York City. He wakes up the next morning and gets a call about Chrissy's murder. He stops by the office where the medical inspector calls Brody and gives him the probable cause of death: shark attack. Frightened and concerned, Brody rushes out of the office and begins to find a way to put a stop to this. While trying to shut the beaches down, LARRY VAUGHN (played by Murray Hamilton), the mayor of Amity Island, doesn't want Martin to do anything that involves closing the beaches, for Vaughn is one greedy S.O.B., who wants nothing, but money. The next afternoon, while the town is lying on the beach, a little boy by the name of ALEX KINTAR (played by Jeffrey Voorhees) becomes the shark's next victim. Brody panics and finally decides to put a stop to this. He calls shark expert MATT HOOPER (played by Richard Dreyfuess). The two team up and find a way to put to end it. While in the middle of doing so, the town meets QUINT (played by the late Robert Shaw), a somewhat eccentric fisherman who requests that he be given the job of killing the great white terror for $10,000,000. Brody doesn't care how much Quint wants as long as he kills the shark. The next day, a bunch of Amity's local fishermen, led by Amity's local fisherman, BEN GARDENER (played by Craig Kingsbury), catch what they think is a shark. The type of shark they caught was a tiger shark, which means that they were nowhere near even catching the one they were after, for the one they're after is a great white. Later that night, Hooper stops over to see Martin. The two decide to go with Hooper's idea: Cut open the tiger shark to see if this is the right shark. The digestive system of all sharks is extremely slow, meaning whatever a shark has eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be within the shark. If they cut open the shark and happen to see the Kintar boy come rolling out, then they've caught the shark. They cut it open and find only two fish, a tin can, and a license plate. Tiger sharks are like garbage disposals, they'll eat anything in their paths. They concluded that the tiger shark is definitely not the killer shark. Hooper informs Brody that sharks mostly feed at night, so they head out to find the killer shark. Instead, the end up finding Ben Gardner's boat all banged up. Hooper investigates the boat by diving in the water and coming underneath the boat. But while checking the bottom of the boat, Hooper finds Gardner's dead body. The two try to convince Vaughn to keep the beaches closed, especially on July 4th, but as greedy as Vaughn is, he refuses.  <br />July fourth arrives and everything goes well until Michael, who is in a boat with his friends, is attacked by the shark. Michael appears to be okay and unharmed. He went into slight shock, forcing Brody to hire Quint to kill the shark once and for all.  <br /> <br />Brody and Hooper join Quint on the journey to kill what has been terrorizing the peaceful island of Amity for the past two weeks. They come close to getting him, but fail. By the next morning, the three continue on with their job. Hooper decides the only to actually do this is for him to get into a shark cage and stab the shark with a spear filled with poison, but that fails for the shark tears the cage up like it is nothing. As for the boat, it begins to sink for there is a huge hole in the bottom of it. The shark comes up onto the boat as it sinks even further. Quint begins to slide towards the shark as Brody grabs him, but he loses his grip, where Quint is killed by the shark. Brody, seeing Quint dead, thinking Hooper is dead, is all alone. He grabs one of Hooper's air tanks and throws into the shark's mouth. Brody goes back on deck, grabs a rifle, and prepares to shoot the tank, still within the shark's mouth. He begins shooting at the shark. He finally shoots the air tank and blows up the shark. Afterwards, Hooper arises from the water, still alive and unharmed. Brody and Hooper grab a couple of rafts and head out to shore, after putting Amity Island back into a safe haven for the residents and vacationers.  <br /> <br />Every summer when I watch this film, I never get tired of it. I mostly watch it during the summer when in Florida for two weeks. Everybody should have seen and own this film. No excuses whatsoever. None. If you don't have it, buy it.
B0007P3582|1.0|I have decided to write this because I wanted to get through to some of these people who have given this album 5 stars! This album just about deserves 1 star as it is not hip-hop, it is r&b garbage. <br />I've been an american hip-hop fan since I can remeber and 50 Cent just doesnt cut it for me. Before he joined Shady his music was really good and fresh like, 'How To Rob' on his 1st album, 'The Power Of The Dollar'. This album, however, is rubbish, 50 cent has turned into an R&B wannabe. <br />If you listen to REAL hip-hop and you ARE a REAL hip-hop fan you will agree with me that this is nothing short of lame. <br />It feals as thoght 50 doesnt even try to come up with actual material. His songs consist of 'Candyshop', 'Disco Inferno' and 'Just a lil bit'.... WTF ARE THESE TRACKS!!! what have they got to do with hip-hop! nothing! <br />They are all just lame party/dance songs to get more money. 50 Cent doesnt care about his fans, he just wants to make money so he makes really s*** tracks like these. <br /> <br />If you are a TRUE hip-hop fan then stay away from this s***, but if you wanna dance to cheap rubbish then by all means waste money on this. <br />If your looking for really good albums look elsewhere like Nas - Illmatic, Slick Rick - The Great Adventures Of, The Notorious B.I.G. - Ready To Die, 2pac - All Eyez On Me, De La Soul - 3 Feet And Rising, etc. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading :) <br /> <br />- Hollaballooza
0515123447|5.0|Someone wrote that Lee Child is the best author that you're not reading yet. Absolutely true. On my 'About You' area, there's an ad box for 'people who read ____ also read ____ .' This little icon had listed Child in there for probably two months. Finally I gave up and got \\"The Enemy\\" and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the attraction is. Certainly it's well written stuff. Complicated. Good dialogue. Violent. Lot's of great retribution. A little bit of redemption now and again.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a West Point man with thirteen years in the Army, 'riffed' . . .  reduction in force . . . after the budget cut backs under Bush the Ist and Clinton (\\"Ahhh did not have sex with that womin!\\"). Anyhow Reacher is cut loose.<br /><br />That's probably the first of very few flaws that I find. It's a small point, liking eating a great meal but after you have a little bit of food caught in your gum. He's West Point. He's a killing machine. He's been in combat. His success rate as a Military Police (MP) investigator is sky high. He is deep selected for Major, a good Field Grade position enroute to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel; He's got an engineering degree from one of the toughest schools in the world. Makes the Brits at Sandhurst look like they're in a Teachers College in Ohio.<br /><br />Not a big point. But then he wanders the earth, like Cain in Kung Fu from the abominable '60's. See, Mr. Child was a screenwriter so some of this Sergio Leone stuff of the vagrant gunfighter rolling into town makes sense. But no shoes, no shirt, no service . . . like the sign says, don't bother coming in.<br /><br />So I don't have a problem with the plotting. The plots are tight and well constructed. Evil guys; some of them connected to the/a government; a trusted compatriot who is not as fearless or smart as Jack; a hot chick who sometimes lives, sometimes dies, makes out with Reacher but never sticks around. I just fumble around with how he got there. Walking the earth for truth and justice is the old Billy Jack theme. The '60's died. Thank God.<br /><br />OK. Lest I be misunderstood. This is great reading. It's fun, not necessarily funny but wry, and as I said, who minds when evil people get the stuff kicked out of them?<br /><br />Jack ends up in Margrave, Georgia outside of 'Lanta, and meets Roscoe and Finlay, Roscoe being the hot police officer who falls for Reacher (and likewise) and Finlay being the retired back to work Boston detective transferred by chance, like Reacher, to Margrave.<br /><br />Counterfieting's the problem, which brings Jack's older brother, Joe, a brilliant Treasury Agent to Margrave also. Unexpectedly. The two brothers don't stay in touch. Rather they are both solo performers in their own worlds. Joe more cerebral; Jack more over the edge. Issues of loyalty arise. Putting adolescent responsibilities in order. Maintaining your integrity. And yes, righting wrongs.<br /><br />Written in the complicated first person but highly descriptive and tight nonetheless.<br /><br />Great stuff.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I became a huge fan of ColdPlay when I heard the song Trouble on there first album Parachutes.  I diffently could not wait for there third album X&Y and it was worth the wait.  Every song on here is so good and to me there musical talent's just keep getting better every cd.  There such an amazing band!!!  Every song on here is good, there isnt one that I don't like.  Chris just has an amazing voice and he sing's the songs so well.  Keep it up ColdPlay!!!!!
B0000W3YIS|5.0|Being Madonna's fan, i kinda liked britney. In fact, i have all her previous albums but i often listen to them. When the \\"In The Zone\\" album was out back in 2003 with its 1st Single Me Against the Music, I was impressed. Then Toxic was released and I So Loved it. <br /> <br />After watching all her TV specials, performances and the Onyx Hotel Tour (which is her best tour ever!), i definetely had to buy this album. <br /> <br />When i got it, i was like wooow, this is her best material so far, Its very fresh, has a lot of different music styles and its sound very mature (despite some lyrics). <br /> <br />Breathe On Me was going to be released as a single (and video), cause its the best song from the album and it would've been such a huge hit but it was Cancelled due to Catwoman movie who wanted Outrageous (which it all was screwed). <br /> <br />This is my personal review on the songs: <br /> <br />Me Against the Music - 5/5 (with the Queen of Pop Madonna) <br /> <br />Boom Boom - 4/5 (very hip.hopish and catchy) <br /> <br />Showdown - 4/5 (sexy, misteriously) <br /> <br />Breathe On Me - 6/5 (i think there's no words to express this awesome dance track that puts u in a sexual dance floor) <br />Early Mornin' - 3/5 (Moby Collaboration, pretty nice) <br /> <br />Toxic - 5/5 (awesome dance track and amazing strings, cant get that song from ur mind) <br /> <br />Outrageous - 5/5 (a great hip hop track produced by R. kelly) <br /> <br />Touch of My Hand - 4/5  (beautiful far east alike song about self loving) <br /> <br />Shadow - 2/5 (gorgeous ballad, but not my favorite) <br /> <br />The Hook Up - 5/5 (hot and warm track, makes u wanna dance) <br /> <br />Brave New Girl - 3/5 (very goofy Barbie song, but good to have some fun) <br /> <br />Everytime - 5/5 (Amazing stunning ballad about love breaking, 100% recommended - Shame they changed the original concept of the video [britney's suicide]) <br /> <br />Me Against the Music Remix - 5/5 (a hot dance remix, Hindu style] <br /> <br /> <br />          Bonus tracks: If u gonna buy the album, be sure u have at least the 1st bonus track which is amaaaaaaaaazing. <br /> <br />The Answer - 6/5 (awesome Im a Slave alike mid-slow track, very impressive, shame it wasnt included in the standard tracklisting) <br /> <br />Don't Hang Up - 3/5 (not my fav, but its pretty cool). <br /> <br /> <br />After listening this album, i almost totally forgot about her previous albums (except Britney: Im a Slave 4 U & Boys). But its a shame how this album ended, the best tracks that was going to be furthcoming hit singles, were cancelled. So the ITZ based tour \\"Onyx Hotel\\". <br /> <br />I recommend it 200%.
B000002H33|5.0|Not liking where metal is headed right now, I pulled this record out today.  It still smokes. <br /> <br />Every track on here is fantastic.  My favorite is Disposable Heroes.   <br /> <br />Listening to these songs takes me back to late nights studying in college, when caffeine and Metallica were all that kept me going.  What great, great stuff.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|X&amp;Y is probably the most mature, and the most daring of all of Coldplay albums to date.  It might take a few listens to get really into it but this is bound to be one of the greatest albums of the decade.  The standout track on X&amp;Y is &quot;Fix You&quot;.  It is the type of song that starts of slow and just creeps up on you and near the end of it, just totally blows you away.  The other standout track is the &quot;Hardest Part&quot; where Martin sings, the &quot;hardest part was letting go/not taking part&quot;.  This is where Martin really shines as a singer as he sings those high notes and just makes you fall in love with the song.  The guitar riffs mixed with the subtle piano notes is  what made Coldplay so popular and they shine again throughout the album.  Square one starts off as the edgy song with those great riffs and just sets the stage for the rest of the album.  The only weak song from this album is &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; itself.  However, the other songs are just so amazing that you tend to forget about what's weak about this album.  This album needs a few listens to get used to it.  But once you get to that level, you'll appreciate just how great this cd really is.
0393307050|3.0|I read Master and Commander based on the numerous people who assured me that Patrick O'Brian is one of the finest, if not the finest, (historical) novelists of our time. But after having read Master and Commander, I must say I was very disappointed. Much of the book is entirely incomprehensible to anyone but those already familiar with Napoleonic nautical terms, as well the names and details of a ship's rigging, etc. Much of the book read like an old manual on sailing. The rest of the story consisted of a series of attempts to capture \\"prizes,\\" ie: ships belonging to enemy fleets. There's no central plot, per se, just a series of descriptions of life at sea, particularly as they are experienced by the novel's two main characters: the ship's master and commander, Jack Aubrey and its surgeon, Stephen Maturin. True, it is clear that O'Brian has a love of the english language that shows in his prose, and has clearly done his homework in recreating that period of naval history, nevertheless, the greatness of this novel is highly exaggerated. It's good, but not great. Keep in mind that I have only read the first in the series.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Yes, it IS good.  I still think Waking the Fallen is better and is their best effort to date.  This CD does not get the \\"juices\\" flowin' like the previous CD's.  I won't bother reviewing every song since that's been done and I generally agree only I'm not that big of fan of the bubble gum song \\"Bat Country\\".  \\"The Wickend End\\" is a much better song in my opinion.   <br /> <br />You won't be let down by the musical talent of the band members that's for sure.  The music itself is as good as any of the other CD's.  It's the vocals that suffer.  I have to agree that the singing sounds way too nasal and whiny.  I liked some of the screaming on Waking the Fallen but really liked the GROWL.  This CD is laking GROWL.  It just doesn't pump you up like the others. <br /> <br />Oh well.  Still good, just not GREAT.
B00061QK02|4.0|After watching this film, I thought my ribs were cracked from laughing so hard. I really loved this movie, but I can't give it a perfect rating for a few reasons. First, Will Ferrell is SO annoying, I mean, he's not even funny most of the movie. Sure, there are some funny scenes he's involved in, but he just gets on my nerves most of the time. Secondly, there really is no plot that matters to this movie; it is a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter compiled into a movie. And there are situations where this movie has chances to do stuff and doesn't take advantage of their chance to make people laugh even harder. <br /> <br />However, there are so many reasons to love this film! Steve Carell does one heck of a job as retarded weatherman Brick Tamland. He steals the show and I found him, along with Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana, to be the funniest people in the movie. Carell is the guy with the belly laughs in this film, and if he wasn't in this movie it wouldn't be the same. There are so many memorable lines in this movie that I can't remember them all. And Christina Applegate does a good job as female anchor Veronica Corningstone. <br /> <br />Anyway, without Ferrell and using a better funnyman than him as Ron Burgundy, this movie would have been much better than it already is. Thats why I give it a 4, not a five.
6300214559|4.0|The common complaint about this film since its release is the inaccuracy concerning the \\"love story\\" between Guildford and Jane.  It's certainly true that the couple were not the passionate lovers depicted in the movie:  the marriage itself was actually not consummated, per the orders of both sets of parents, until Edward VI was dead - an arrangement which suited Jane just fine. <br /> <br />What's also inaccurate is the portrayal of Jane and Guildford as sixteenth-century Socialists, fighting for the rights of peasants and pursuing economic justice in the form of a \\"real shilling.\\"  In all probability, neither of them gave much of a rat's ass about the poor, in keeping with the attitudes of their own class:  Guildford was by most accounts a spoiled brat, and Jane, while undoubtedly intelligent (having been raised for a time under the tutelage of Queen Katharine Parr), was far more interested in ongoing Protestant reform than in social and economic reform.  Ironically, *had* Jane gone on to reign, it's quite likely that she would have been every bit as intolerant as Mary I in terms of religion. <br /> <br />So Jane and Guildford were hardly compassionate do-gooders determined to make the most of their tragically short lives, nor was theirs the romance of the ages.  This is still a fine movie -- beautifully filmed, well-acted, and - if you're willing to suspend the window of disbelief - a good tearjerker of a \\"historical romance.\\"
B0006L16N8|1.0|Let me start by saying that when I was first introduced to Colplay's music about 5 years ago, I thought they were the greatest band to come along in a very long time. They knew how to play, write and after seeing them in concert, I thought they were solid showmen. I also enjoy a good sappy love song as much as the next guy (if it's well-written).     That being said, what the heck are these guys thinking?? I am absolutely shocked that EMI have allowed Coldplay to release an album that is unimaginative, poorly written and filled with every cliche lyric known to mankind (you'll be able to sing along 15 seconds into the first listen).  Additionally, X&Y sounds like a thoughtless, watered-down version of everything they've ever produced. I'll even go so far to say that it's the crappiest piece of recorded crap in the history of crappy music.    If you're looking for something new, or something that is well crafted, look elsewhere. I don't advocate piracy, but do yourself a favor:  Save your money, and download it from Kazaa, or Limewire, 'cause EMI and Coldplay sure don't deserve one cent of your hard earned money.    My only regret is that I pre-ordered the album from Itunes, and could not get my money back.
B0007OCG56|2.0|I don't know...I watched about an hour and a half of this movie and it just never \\"caught\\" me...it just didn't seem to be going in any type of a direction, it was just blah. I thought it was a bad sign when I was an hour and a half into the movie and 1) didn't really care what the ending was and 2) couldn't even think of a satisfying ending. It was just an okay movie for me, that has little to no rewatchability.
6304493681|3.0|It's everyone's favorite sythetic lesbian ghost hacking whore's big screen debut! How can you not get excited over that? And if that offends you, don't worry, there's none of that in this movie (the whoring part that is...). <br /> <br />Ghost in the Shell is a cult classic among many, many anime fans, but to be honest, I'm not sure why. I've seen Ninja Scroll, Evangelion, El-Hazard, Princess Mononoke, Patlabor, and more - so I think I'm sufficiently experienced to say: Ghost in the Shell ain't all that. Even though the animation is incredible (even by today's standards), what this boils down to is a high tech animated cop drama.  <br /> <br />The entire Ghost in the Shell world revolves around a cyber cop (the woman on the cover, Motoko Kusanagi) and her team of investigators (called Section 9) as they track down cyber-criminals and hackers. Aside from the glorious animation, that's not enough to keep me thrilled. The characters aren't as deep as I would have hoped, and they all seem a tad bit dull, in terms of personality.  <br /> <br />Some of the people who rant and rave over GITS may have more experience with the Ghost in the Shell manga (on which this movie was based). Perhaps their love of Motoko is deeper than mine will ever be, and perhaps they understand the Ghost in the Shell universe better than I do. But the fact is, just watching this movie by itself won't do much to draw you into the world of Section 9. It's almost as if you need to know about Ghost in the Shell's world before watching this movie, because the creators don't take the time to explain everything to you.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I'm not one of those who seemed to hate Enterprise because it wasn't Kirk or Picard and was a prequel to those versions. I always found the level of set & story detail to be amazing (maybe subsequent DVD sets will go into that more). That might be some critic's problem with Enterprise- the NX-01 looked so much better than previous ships.  I did like the introduction of the Klingons(Broken Bow)but didn't care for the Suliban/temporal wars angle (never really handled well then slopped off at the end of third/start of fourth seasons). I don't remember the Andorians (The Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem)all that well from the original series but I \\"liked\\" the way they were presented here. The Vulcans (most episodes) were very different from what we've always known, too bad it took four years to get around to really explaining that. I am one of those who did like the presentation, just wish they'd handled it better.  Many of the stories are of the \\"I've seen it before\\" variety but what do you expect after almost 40 years? I wish the series had gone on for at lest 2 or 3 more years. Most of the stories will hold up pretty well with time, better than many in the original series.  I liked the extra's but think the packaging is way overdone (seems to be a Star Trek trait)and dislike the pricing (very high but Amazon is as cheap as anyone when you figure in free shipping)but I'll buy the other sets when they come out, and hope they've got the behind the scenes stuff this set doesn't have.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It seems some fans are disappointed that Coldplay's newest release is not a radical development from their first two albums; no, the band have not yet reached their peak, but come on, its only their third album for christ's sakes! At this point in their career U2 had only released WAR (1983); if we judged their career on the output up to that point, we would be missing out on their next three great albums THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE and JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG BABY.  There is lots more to come from this great band.  Also, this band is NOT radiohead (as great as radiohead are); just because they are both british does not mean this.  Coldplay are intent on improving the state of mainstream music while Radiohead decided to venture into electronica and art music.  If Coldplay had decided to take this path their career would have ended pretty quickly; even radiohead, as great as they are, have now come to a fork in the road with their mediocre last effort HAIL TO THE THIEF. Martin and Co are slowly and carefully progressing their sound with each album and I think this should be respected by critics.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I just found out about this album the day it was released; completely had NO idea that DT was releasing an album, but it couldn't have come at a better time!! <br /> <br />There's not much more that I can say that other reviewers haven't already covered, but I will say that do NOT listen to the harsh criticisms that are to be found on this product so far; for the mature DT fan like myself, this album is very refreshing.  Mainly because the band is performing very much like a \\"band\\" moreso than their last effort, \\"Train of Thought\\".  Now while I do love DT songs that show off musicianship ala a million-notes-per-second...it's nice to have some simpler cathy tunage such as what \\"Octavarium\\" offers. <br /> <br />Oh, and i'll say it...I LOVE \\"\\"I Walk Beside You\\"!!!!!!

0060977493|4.0|To say that Ms. Roy's use of language as an exploration of the individual and social psyche is simply a weak substitute for a lack of fluidity in story-telling is narrow and weak criticism. Yes, there are some elements in her narration that could use more editing, and tightening. And not enough is done to maintain the suspense of the fiction or to make the revelation of events any kind of revelation at all.<br /><br />But is the exquisite use of language - its control, manipulation, an understanding of the subtle powers that lie beneath the surface of words, is all this not an un-teachable art in itself? Ms. Roy's genius is apparent like a blinding flash of light throughout the novel, especially in scenes where she describes the methodical, cathargic torture of the small, innocent and un-important ones by those who have been oppressed themselves. Once her words leave the pages of the novel  I believe they will take permanent residence in the eyes, ears, minds and hearts of the readers.<br /><br />Fitzgerald had his Gatsby and Ms. Roy has her Estha and Rahel -  all victims of their dreams and society's displaced anger and civilized, structured hatred.
B00005QIPH|5.0|What if I could offer you instant happiness? This happiness could be obtained without having to take any pills, invest large sums of money, vote Socialist in the next election or meet any new and interesting friends in the county lock-up. My guess is that most of you would be interested in my offer. Now, that you're interested, all you have to do is find your way to the nearest mall or dot com so you can obtain the 2001 release, \\"Is This It\\", by the band The Strokes. It is not merely a collection of tunes; it is an ecstatic dose of acoustic Wellbutrin.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out what happened with this record even though I bought it over three years ago. One minute I was slogging along with my anti-pop culture friends and deriding this age of musical nihilism and the next I'm in my living room singing \\"He won't decide but he won't debate.\\"<br /><br />I purchased the CD after hearing the addictive radio single, \\"Last Night.\\" I usually don't buy a lot of new releases, as I'm often severely disappointed. It is rare when I find the popular stuff worthwhile. Yet, the first time I heard the record I knew it was special before the sixth or seventh song even began to play. Their sound is effervescent and stimulates regardless of the volume at which they are heard. Many may dismiss their compositions as being merely \\"catchy\\" but I think this is incorrect. There is a quiet complexity to their sound and, as my friend Grange put it, \\"They're so smooth it's actually deceptive- because there's actually a whole lot going on.\\"<br /><br />I will acknowledge that their physical appearance is not confidence inspiring. They appear on television in ultra-trendy dress and their liner note photos make them look as if they each individually drank three barrels apiece from the fountain of youth. Yet inexperience and glamour do not contaminate the end product which vibrates from your speakers.<br /><br />The truest proof I can offer of their excellence is that \\"Is This It\\" did not leave my CD player for three months time after purchase. I'd give it a quick play on a daily basis. Only now have I reached the point where the record infrequently breaks into the rotation but I still appreciate it whenever it does.<br /><br />The Strokes have become my default option whenever the need to buy a gift arises. For my mother's birthday last year, I decided to amazon her the album (along with a bunch of other stuff). My mom loved it and when I visited for Christmas I found the record on her passenger seat, which suggested heavy use.<br /><br />One of my friends was going through a nasty bout of melancholia so I decided to give it to him as a present. He reported to me that the vitality of the melodies actually made him feel better.<br /><br />Is this a hybrid, commercially fabricated band?  Who cares.  They're great and that's all I care about. Sometimes a band of mercenaries can be melded into a unit and the end result is a Stanley Cup champion or a Super Bowl victory. Regardless of influence or history, The Strokes sound grand and that's enough for me. If you're in the need for cheap euphoria, get ready because this is it.s It\\" did not leave my CD player for three months time after purchase. I'd give it a quick play on a daily basis.

B0002858YS|5.0|About five people recommended this CD to me, but I didn't get it until \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" got heavy airplay.  To my pleasant surprise, \\"Somebody Told Me\\" isn't anywhere near the best song on Hot Fuss.  My own personal favorite is \\"Change Your Mind,\\" which is one of the few tunes that I ever remember, in my entire life, listening to for the first time and loving right away.  Heck, I knew it was great thirty seconds in. I also am quite fond of \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\\"  Really, the only song I deleted from my MP3 player was \\"Andy, You're a Star.\\"  Other than that, there's not a bad track in the 11.  This Brandon Flowers certainly has a wonderful, and hypnotizing, voice.  I'm not saying he's technically brilliant but he is engrossing as you hang on his every word.  This is one of the rare popstorm hits that actually lives up to expectations.  I'd be very surprised if The Killers don't build on their success in the future.  I hope they're around for awhile.
B00097A5I6|4.0|I don't think there's a single _bad_ song on Don't Believe the Truth. For the most part, the songs are surprisingly short and tight, and you can tell it's the work of an experienced group. <br /> <br />Still, at first, it just doesn't capture the imagination. It's hard to say what they've lost from the Morning Glory days, but there's something that made the ambiguous lyrics of those songs extremely moving, whereas lines like \\"I could be your enemy / I guess there's still time / I'd get round to loving you / is that such a crime?\\" just make you squint. Many of the early songs on the DBT are love songs, but they don't give you a very strong sense either of a transfiguring passion or the object of their affections. \\"Heaven help you catch me if I fall,\\" Liam sings to a girl named Lyla - who is Lyla? Nothing holds the song together except for vague star imagery, and it isn't very catchy. <br /> <br />Again, it's hard to say why \\"slowly walking down the hall / faster than a cannonball\\" was so much more impressive, especially when Noel admits that 'cannonball' was all he could think of to rhyme 'hall' - but there's just a general sense of vagueness and disappointment; nothing to really make the music live. Champagne Supernova wasn't about anything, as far as I could figure out, but it almost brings tears to the eyes. Lyla isn't about anything, and it doesn't have much to reccomend it. <br /> <br />Still, there are a few good songs - I like \\"Turn Up The Sun,\\" and \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" has its moment - and DBT really takes off with the last three songs. If the entire album could have lived up to that standard, it might even have been better than Morning Glory. <br /> <br />I think some Oasis' best songs are statements of hope and renewal - Don't Look Back in Anger, Some Might Say - and the upbeat tone of these last three songs very much recalls Morning Glory: \\"The sun will shine on you again / a bell will ring inside your head / and all will be brand new,\\" they sing fiercely, proudly, on the penultimate track. Keep the Dream alive is an impressive ballad, A Bell Will Ring has all of Oasis' trademark power and cocksureness, and Let There Be Love is gorgeous, a slow, surprisingly sweet love song that is (inexplicably) so much more _convincing_ than Love Like a Bomb or Lyla. When Liam sings to his 'baby blue,' you somehow think: \\"Yes, _this_ is a _love_ song.\\" Let there be love, indeed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|This by far, has to be the best CD I've heard in a long time. I play it so much I'm surprised I haven't worn a hole in it. None of the songs on the CD is alike.  Some make you want to groove, others make you want to grab your honey and well...you know. He keeps it real.  He has a way with love. Love is good, but he lets you know that you definitely have to work at it.  I absolutely love it!  I've already recommended it to family and friends.  So far, their feedback has been positive as well.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|One would be most accurate in describing the style of TMV as \\"chop suey\\" rather than prog since PROG presupposes an underlying COCEPT that builds and binds DEVELOPPED themes with a harmonic FLOW to create a unified COMPOSTION. TMV abandon all these things and instead aimlessly noodle their way through 77 minutes of dated synthesizer bleeps and chopped rudiments of what one would call \\"riffs\\". Rush made the same mistake 30 years ago until they finally realized their limited talents in songcraft, but sadly not until their 6th album. Considering that in the CD age bands can press the noodlings of formerly 2 albums on one there's good hope TMV may get it right on their next release.
B000002JKA|3.0|DT after they got rudess they were almost strictly a shred band wither that or pompous over blown band. The band still sound the biggest here ut there songs sound almost like songs instead of long shapeless diatribes. The band churn out the epic arena thudders with technique and heaviness without sounding drawn out on numbers like \\"lie\\" and \\"6 oclock\\". tracks like \\"Spce Dye Vest\\" show the bands gothic personality never seen again. Kevin Moore relied on 80's synth effects at times but at ohers he created hints of dramatic tension as compared to rudess colorless noodling. Some pieces here in the end still lack fine shaping but form band forever rembered for the never ending song here they sound like htye used know a thing about craft
B000002AH7|5.0|I remember taking a college course on the history of jazz, and skipping quickly over this album.  We covered all of Miles Davis' other styles, but for some reason, the instructor felt that this album lacked the improvisation and \\"swing\\" element that is supposed to characterize jazz.  That is what is brilliant about this record; it doesn't sound like anything before it.  Miles Davis' trumpet (and occasional flugel horn) blend with these Spanish melodies perfectly, as though he was always meant to play them.  More importantly, this album introduced the concept of \\"mood\\" to popular music.  Many rock artists from the era also took note of this Miles Davis and Gil Evans collaboration, and applied the same musical brush strokes to their own work.  Absolutely essential in any collection of music!
1582432678|5.0|This is a masterfully crafted book that is, once begun, almost impossible to put down. The driven, headlong narrative propells you through the lifetime of 17-year-old Kevin, a juvenile offender who murdered nine people in the gym of his high school. What sets this novel apart is its focus on the boy's mother, Eva, and her own struggle with these events and with the long years that lead up to the massacre.  <br /> <br />This is a book that you will hand to your friends just to have someone to talk to about it. For so \\"important\\" a topic there are no easy answers and much is left unsaid. Those reviewers who complain about the length have surely missed the point - it could easily be twice as long. But perhaps we would be no closer to the truth at that. <br /> <br />What many readers don't seem to appreciate is the ambiguity of this book, and the degree to which Eva's narrative is an unreliable one. This is a very opinionated and stubborn woman (I can't reliably use the word \\"character\\", so real she seemed to me) who has her story and is sticking to it. Yet, and I have to emphasize this strongly, *any woman who is convinced that her toddler is out to get her cannot be fully believed.* Eva was not prepared for motherhood, was ambivalent about the deal from the beginning, and resentful of its affects on her body, her independence, and her career. From the very moment of birth she failed to bond with her son and very quickly developed an active dislike that would grow to hate. How much of her version of events is an objectively accurate one is a key point of the novel, as Lionel Shriver herself has emphasized in interviews. At many points in the reading of the novel I longed for a second, companion novel that would be told from Kevin's point of view - since we lack this entirely, a reader is forced to reconstruct Kevin from those bits and pieces of information we can deem believable, weighed down with the knowledge that the boy would go on to be a mass-murderer.  <br /> <br />KEVIN is more than anything the story of an epic psychological struggle between mother and son that ends in tragedy. Whether you guess the gruesome surprise waiting for you at the conclusion of the novel (it's not difficult) is nearly irrelevant, as this should only increase your dread of the events to come. If anything KEVIN reminds me of a Greek tragedy, where uncontestable family bonds and unchecked emotion doom everyone to a horrible fate. It is also (to the degree that Eva is truthful) an accurate portrayal of sociopathy as well as, even more interestingly, the societal burden placed on motherhood that in this particular case backfired so very tragically.

B000000OQF|5.0|I remember sitting outside the old Omni concert venue in Atlanta,Ga waiting to get tix to see Motley Crue and Guns n' Roses, I had NO idea who they were. This guy in line had this really bad recording he had made off the radio of the song \\"welcome to the jungle\\". It was a bad recording he had made while he was in L.A. <br />That song was amazing. It was nothing but attitude. I was definately curious after that. I had a friend who worked in a record store and she called me about 2 weeks before the show and told me they had 3 copies of Appetite for Destruction. I was there in 15 minutes. In the matter of hours I was hooked. It was an mind blowing piece of work. Bye the time I seen them live I knew I was seeing something that comes along once in a generation. Axl was a frontman  with the same bravado as Tyler, Morrison, Plant, or Daltry.  <br />From begining to end this cd is one of the 10 greatest recordings in history of rock music.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Mediocre horror film that not only has one of the worse stories ever written for a film of this nature but has some of the worse dialog as well. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence has promise but he lacks the professionalism to keep this movie from falling part from its own stupidity and he lacks the experience to put on a better show. Keanu Reeves is so miscast in his role that it's almost too painful to watch him on screen and the way he plays the character is so annoying that you just end up looking away from him because of his bad performance. They are much better actors in the film that do make lemonade out of lemons with Rachel Weisz making this movie bearable with her great and game performance and Peter Stormare, who gives way too much class to his small role which does far more for the film than Keanu and most of the cast combine.  <br /> <br />See the film for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare who do try their best with the bad material they both had to work with and they both almost succeed in making you forget how bad the movie really is. Other then their efforts though, this is still not a good movie and I suggest you wait for cable instead.  <br />
B00000FCBC|5.0|When I first heard about this cd I was very interested in what Metallica was looking for. When I heard it I was shocked at good it sounded. I was happy to see that they had went back to re visit their past and I was hoping it would bring them a new future. The songs here are a great cross section of the original influences that made Metallica what they were in the 80's. <br />I have followed these guys for years and have seen them live several times. They have influenced the rock world in so many ways. Sometimes I think they may be my generations version of Zepplin with how they have changed music. <br />This cd is alot of fun. <br />Some of the covers are better than the original versions.  <br />The Mercyful fate piece is incredible fillied with energy and anger. Cd 2 is a prize in itself. all the B-sides together plus garage( the original). <br />I wish this would have been the step back needed to see the future.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I thought Avenged Sevenfold was a unique band. They had a great new sound, released two smash hits and were musicaly talented. Now all that is gone. This album sounds like complete trash. There is NO mixing of heavy metal and punk sounds like their other albums and the guitar riffs are all the same and M. Shadows voice sounds like he got kicked in the nuts to hard. It is two bad that the saying \\"Third time's a charm\\" isn't true anymore. The only reason why it gets two stars is because the art work is kind of cool. If you are new to A7X, don't start with this. Get Waking the Fallen or Sound the Seventh Trumpet. If you are a long time fan, I still wouldn't bother paying 15 dollars for this.
B000002H33|5.0|After all these years this cd is still one of the best I have heard ( a close second to Ride the Lightning). What happene to guys now? I see them now and when i listen to MOP I think something is definately missing now. The power and anger harnessed in this cd is something that I miss completely with th newr recordings from Metallica. What they make now is noise and is genenerally worthless garbage. With Master of Puppets it was such a step forward in music. I miss the days when the \\"radio\\" knew nothing of Metallica. Master of Puppets is a masterpiece in the music world. It continued the revolution that Ride the Lightning started. <br />I miss the real Metallica heard here on this cd
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Van Helsing was...bad. <br /> <br />The plot was weak, most of the action scenes were laughable. <br /> <br />The only funny thing was the ?monk?. He was hilarious.  <br /> <br />Most of the \\"surprises,\\" were not surprises. <br /> <br />If the family had to kill dracula or go to hell (or something like that) then why didnt they have more than two children? And why hadn't their late 20's daughter not already had children? If she was willing enough to rebel and wear pants, why bother with the corset?  Im sure they could have found something a bit more appropriate that still managed to have the sex appeal they were trying for. <br /> <br />They needed to explain much more. Maybe if they had said, 9 of my siblings died fighting the supernatural beasts, we're the only ones left. Instead they left it unexplained. <br /> <br />I would recemmend getting this movie from Netflix, or catching it on TV, where you dont have to pay much. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is the ?monk?.
B000002H2H|5.0|I remember when I first heard this cd. I heard the song \\"For whom the Bell tolls\\". I was completely blown away. This is one of the cds that will change your life. If \\"Kill'em All\\" was the blueprint for thrash then this was the revolution that the music world was not ready for. This cd is dark as it explores death in many ways. Suicide, electrocution, and nuclear war. . <br /> <br />Bye and far the best recording the Metallica has ever made. It shows the world how to redifne music for the next 20+yrs.  <br />I have seen them live many times. When they play the music from the cd it still sounds great. <br /> <br />Maybe the best song of their career is on this one ( FAde to Black)
B000001G5H|4.0|I do admire Pollini because of his many achievements in music: he go straight to the highest goals in every situation on the keyboard. His tone and colors are wonderfull. I believe some people feel insecure because of his conviction as a pianist, because he left so much people behind. Altough some pieces sound wonderfull when are played in a direct way, some others loss they charm and feeling. Pollini's heavy hand can blur the effect of a fast and clear legato. And I do believe he plays some music as a contract that he needs to get done. That's the problem with all the \\"complete cycles\\". I don't believe that all musicians enjoy the pieces in the same way. I feel diferent things when I listen to Schubert... <br /> <br />Is there anybody that can enjoy the 32 Beethoven sonatas in the same way??? Are they all enjoyable? Where are the fauvorites?  <br /> <br />The same happens with this etudes. Pollini doesn't have the fault for this, he's a human, remember? Life and personal tastes can affect his work. This is the best complete version of the etudes anyway, if you want to talk in terms of complete series.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's been about a week since x & y's release & i read most of the reviews to know the response to Coldplay's new venture. I'm glad that majority of the people have accepted Coldplay's new style. The one's who think otherwise i just want to say that please don't compare them with other bands. Radiohead, U2, Oasis etc.  <br />I'm a huge fan of U2 & i loved Coldplay's previous two albums which were definitely unique in their style.Both \\"Parachutes\\" & \\"AROBTH\\" were slow in their tempo & soft in their beats. With X & Y Coldplay have taken a very bold move to redefine their style & that requires a lot of talent. Only a great band can have the courage to take such a risk. It's an adventure of sorts which takes us all for a ride.  <br />\\"X & Y\\" really complements the style of U2 but it's unique in it's one major factor i.e \\"Chris Martin \\"  Just think of the next best lead singer after \\"Bono\\". Yes, It's Chris !   <br />How can this album be boring or a rip off with such great voice of Chris. I Love his voice & i'm sure you all will accept the fact that his voice is \\"one in a million\\"  That in itself has propelled Coldplay to such amazing heights.  <br /> <br />X & Y begins with \\" Square One\\". This Song wil Propell you to the next level of your senses. Amazing Vocals by Chris & rocking beats & electric guitar are the hihlights of this song. One of the best songs of the album. 9.5/10 <br />\\"What If\\" has a very good piano music just like in \\"The Scientist\\". A song about a Lover contemplating the possible fall out of a cherished relationship. Lovely lyrics & Chris at his best.8/10 <br />\\"White Shadows\\" another song that starts with great tempo with heavy guitar & drums. The back ground vocals (oooooohhh !!1) in the song & the lyrics were just great.7.5/10 <br />\\"Fix You\\" starts of slow with a sound similar to church choir music. Chris sings about the opportunity lost in an Unrequited Love & the Optimism to love again, try again. The Electric guitar in the mid of the song till the end provided that special intensity to this song. The end part was the best. 8/10 <br />\\"Talk\\" amazing Electric guitar throghout the song & the lyrics are the positive points of this song. 8/10 <br />\\"X & Y\\" the only good thing about this song that i found was it's lyrics. If you take my view i didn't like the music of this song. But you might like it. 5/10 <br />\\"speed of Sound\\" the song that will immediately remind you of \\"Clocks\\".  A haunting Piano sound just like in \\"Clocks\\".  I loved the song for it's unique synthesizer sounds. 9/10 <br />\\"A Message\\" My favorite of the album. It's the intensity & the power behind the music of this song that makes me say that this is the best song of the album. You'll love it if you have ever been through a heartbreak. 9.5/10 <br />\\"Low\\" a nice song with great sounds & music. Great rythm & amazing guitar. 8/10 <br />\\"The Hardest Part\\" Very good lyrics. a rythmic piano music in the background is the highlight of this song. 9/10 <br />\\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" another song that is just wonderful to listen to. It will draw you deeper & deeper as it moves. Haunting music & lyrics. 9/10 <br />\\"Twisted Logic\\" good lyrics but i didn't like the music of the song that much. 7/10   <br /> <br />I simply admire Chris's voice. Next only to U2, Coldplay is the only band that have in them to succeed U2 as the best band of the world after they retire. With \\"X & Y\\" they have become a complete band & achieved another level of greatness. <br /> <br />
B0009OPO0S|3.0|Shakira had disappear from us for a while.She came back with \\"Fijacion Oral\\".The lst single \\"La Tortura\\" was a hit and the perfect way to lure fans or other audiences into her persence.For the most part has of now I haven't caught on with this album yet.It's hard toppin one of the best latin albums in music,\\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\".Although,it took me sometimes to catch on to that album has well.I'm not completely disappointed but no song on this ablum stands out just yet.It lacks flow,as far as singing I'm not feeling it and i'm tryin to get to the core of it.I'm not sure if i should recommend this album just yet but as time goes on I'll review this album again.\\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" is the best buy that one and you will not be disappointed.
B00005A46T|2.0|I used to love Slipknot. Back in ninth grade. In retrospect, it made sense... I was filled to the brim with teen angst. So of course, the screamed line of \\"F*** IT ALL!!! F*** THIS WORLD!!! F*** EVERYTHING THAT YOU STAND FOR!!!!!\\" won me over. So, in 2001, upon entering tenth grade, \\"Iowa\\" was released. Ohhh, boy... I thought it was the end-all, be-all of metal!!! <br /> <br />Well, I was a little off on that one. Since then, I discovered (obviously) superior and heavier bands. Slayer, Fear Factory, Pantera, Napalm Death, Pissing Razors, Hatebreed, Biohazard... et cetera. And now, almost four years later, I now realize how mediocre this album is. I'm not going to flat out say it's terrible, like many already have... but it's certainly not as awesome and/or heavy as I thought it was when I was fifteen. <br /> <br />I don't know... maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm getting a little senile in my old age. But the point is, I'm just not that impressed with it anymore. It's still... eh, all right. (which justifies the two stars I give it, as opposed to one) I could still squeeze out three stars for \\"Slipknot\\" (self-titled), even if only for \\"Eyeless\\" and \\"Wait And Bleed\\" (which I still like). But \\"Iowa\\" has just been collecting dust for the last couple of years. Sorry, but it's just not all that great. <br /> <br />It still could be a good stepping stone for kids who want to start getting into metal, though. I'll give it that.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I remember watching this when it first came out and wondering why it did not do so well at the box office?  Then I figured that it was overshadowed by the matrix, so I gave it a chance...How right I was!  This movie should have and does blow the matrix away!  The spectacular gun battle scenes and amazing coriography are simply astounding!  Anyone looking for a film to simply dazzle them that is not well known, then this is your ticket my friend!  Do not hesitate!!!  If for nothing else, seeing the guys face sliced off at the end of the film is well worth it!!
B00005JMCN|3.0|It's not a story about a race horse, it's about how three people and one horse overcame pain and adversity to triumph. Seabiscuit was something of a phenomenon, sort of like an equine Lindbergh, that captivated the American consciousness in the late 1930's and early 40's.  <br />He was the underdog, at a time when many Americans felt like underdogs. The analogy of the underdog horse taking on the plutocratic establishment plays right into the storyline of Americans lead by St. Roosevelt, the Beneficent, guiding the People to the Promised Land.  <br />The treatment was ham-fisted and I was disappointed in the movie. They did a poor job of conveying l'aire du temps. For the most part the characters come across as wooden, two dimensional figures.  Mr. Bridges does a workmanlike job as Mr. Howard, Seabiscuit's owner.  <br />The filming of the race scenes was brilliant, a technical success. I still don't believe two jockeys could carry on a conversation astride horses in the middle of a pack at full gallop, that's the fault of the director, a horrible imposition on the viewer (unless the viewer is a child or a complete idiot.)  <br />This defect points out the problem with this movie. The director and writers have absolutely no respect for audience's intelligence. They throw in implausible devices like jockeys having a conversation because they are lazy and they have utterly no respect for the audience. The depression era black and whites are of a piece with this. It's a blunt instrument, they beat us over the head with propaganda, rather then weaving it seamlessly into the story. <br />This movie is the opposite of its theme.  They had great material, and could have made a winner.  Instead they take third place money.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002P5R|5.0|i sure do like this album i listen to it at least twice a day' jimi is one of my all time favorite musicians' you cant go wrong when listening to jimi hendrix.im sure he would be proud of this album ' just when you think there wont be anymore unrleased albums- or songs they come out with a diffrent version to some of his best hits. so i would be willing to bet  there will be more' and it makes me wonder what will be next. long live hendrix. sure do wish jimi hendrix was still around'
0790731002|1.0|The main reason i came to hate this movie was because of two face.don't get we wrong i think tommy lee jones is a grate actor could have made this role his best.but instead they made him to a joke. To me he was alway the best of the batman bad guy, never good nore evil but both. Not only that he had been at one time brue's best friend. which meant that it wasn't easy for batman to fight him.In this movie we see nothing of this. The part good part bad story is forgotten. In one part two face kept tosing his coin untill he got the side that he wonted. the bad one, the whole pont of the coin was becuase he could not make up his mind.Batman on the other hand seems to have no troubal beating up his one time friend, in fact the only time it there past is brought up is by two facs at the very end and then it's only for a second. As for the rest of the film it looks as if the makers were on LSD or something.
0446677450|3.0|This book gives general finance principles in the first few chapters, and the later chapters are impractical and boring, they seem as if they are written to fill up pages, Kiyosaki always talks about making more money , buy a real estate investments in the most part of the book, but in actual he made money by opening companies setting up productions, by opening new ventures and emphasing on sales and marketing and those things are not discussed in the book. This book is good for a novice who had not yet planned anything in terms of finance.the good things in this book are It brings the concepts of assets and liabilities, introduces financial terms like  Income Statement, Balance Sheet and the relationship between them explains a cash flow. The book discusses about couple of business oppurtunities in real estate, but the discussions are incomplete and out of date.So It would be recommanded for teenagers, and newly graduates and newly wed couples who just feel their income doubled.It is a good book for a start.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|The credits roll and the flagship scorlls across the screen nowadays I say to myself...\\"So begins the second chapter.\\" With 'Revenge Of The Sith' marking the completion of the prequil trilogy 'Star Wars', now christened officially as 'A New Hope' makes so much more sense to me than ever before! I now know who Darth Vader is and where he came from and when he walks through the halls of the flagship for the very first time I now fear him because I truly know how evil he is.<br /><br />Darth Vader's fate now rests in the hands of three people. His old master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his twins Luke and Leia. This movie is the one that started it all back in 1977 introducing us to that Galaxy far far away. Now however everything that i see every charater, every bit of dialogue and ever planet makes so much more sense to me because of the fact the history has been told. But what makes this movie so good is the fact that the great Harrison Ford is in this film as the crafty smuggler Han Solo. Everything he says and does in this movie is just awesome. When you speak to the fans everyone's favorite scene is him pretending to be a storm trooper. I adore this movie so much more now thanks to episode 3, because after what is seen and done you just need that little bit of light back in your system. 'A New Hope' delivers on that account. Still, eventhough the rest of the story is something I can now recite with my eyes closed I now want to enjoy the rest of this story and watch what will unravel now that Luke knows he has to destory the Empire.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you've got a certain album in your collection that makes you weak at the knees, and helps you feel better when you're down, then you know what I mean when I say that OK Computer is \\"that\\" album for me. Sonically, and lyrically, it is absolutely amazing. This album made Radiohead huge around the globe, while setting new standards with it's huge, melodic production. Some of the most unique song writing, effects, and emotionally charged lyrics you will ever have the privilege to hear are all present. This album is truly a piece of art to be treasured.
B000003S09|5.0|Some of the most important music ever. This album marks the point in history where Rock, Jazz & Classical fused into one art form.
0743454537|1.0|Just read the first half, then skip to the epilogue.  I actually kind of liked the ending, although I have to admit it was a bit contrived.  The writing was filled with too many modern cultural references (infomercials, Spiderman movies), cliches, bad metaphors--and what was up with the different font for each voice?  These writing techniques were just too gimmicky--they detracted from an otherwise fascinating subject.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I gave up on this movie halfway through and sent it back. I expected stinging satire of American politics, but what I got was lame & predictable, with adolescent body function jokes and over use of the 'F' word. As Cartman would say, \\"this is a piece cr*p man'
B00012QM8G|5.0|Easily one of the Greatest War Films of All-Time. The film presents the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a member of the Nazi party who incedibley saves the lives of over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The most powerful film of 1993, beautifully shot in black and white it captures the shocking and cruelty of the film. Steven Spielberg's epic masterpice of drama acomplishes something nearly impossible without ever preaching, it's truly Spielberg's greatest film. Winner of seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Screenplay, Cinematography, Music, Editing, and Art Direction, and Director.
6301978587|4.0|i love this movie about an intelligent eager to learn the \\"mysteries of the universe\\" Jewish girl living in Eastern Europe and can only pursue her goal to learn talmud if she disguises herself as a male a very daring thing to try but Yentl was determined as she thought that nothing is impossible the plot does thicken when her real gender gets in the way of acting as her disguise gender and not only is it getting to people around her but it's getting to her anyone and everyone will find a treasured place in their heart for this story that has the meaningfulness, the laughs, and the tears and the only thing that would need to be done would be to pleeeez put this movie on DVD
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay. They are the Pink Floyd of this generation. When they entered the mainstream with their first album \\"Parachutes\\" most people compared them to Radiohead. Then when \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" came out they entered into their own category. Now with \\"X & Y\\" Coldplay keeps it coming. The first five songs on this album are spectacular. Their song \\"Talk\\" I hope catches the radio waves after \\"Spead of Sound.\\" If you loved their second album you have to buy this one. You won't be disappointed.
B0006L16N8|5.0|After looking forward to listening to this album, finally I can say that it is is excellent.  It has got very good songs and really fills my expectations.  <br /> <br />However, there are two things that Coldplay fans we have to recognize: (1) There has not been a big change from AROBTTH, whether it is good or it is bad, and (2) Comparing to AROBTTH, which has a similar style, this album is not so good.  Not only because of the top songs (Clocks, The Scientist), but of the album as a whole. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you liked previous CDs, please listen to this one.  You will enjoy it and play it one time after other! <br /> <br />This is my review of the tracks of the album: <br /> <br />1. Square One. Very good as opening song of the album. Reminds to Politik.  8.5/10 <br /> <br />2. What If.  This ballad is a bit disappointing since it is too slow and does not obtain the wished effect. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. White Shadows.  Second consecutive \\"not so good\\" song in the album that spoils the great opening.  Maybe the worst song in the album...  6.5/10 <br /> <br />4. Fix You.  Incredible song!!!  It starts slow but it gets more intense as time passes.  It will become a classic of pop music.  According to some previous reviews, I am not the only person that thinks that it is the best song in the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Talk.  It is very good. A bit sound of the 80s. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. X&Y.  It is definetely not my favourite song in the album.  Lyrics are a bit simple, although it is nice to hear.  7.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Speed of Sound.  In my opinion, the first single should have been Fix You.  I also like it very much, although it is obviosuly not Clocks.  9/10 <br /> <br />8. A Message.  It sounds a bit as a Beatles' song, specially at the beginning.  It really makes me feel something.  9/10 <br /> <br />9. Low.  It is good although too slow.  The Chorus is specially good. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. The hardest part.  Nice. 8/10 <br /> <br />11. Swallowed in the sea.  Since my first listening, it has been one of my favourites.  Start with only voice and progresses very well.  8.5/10 <br /> <br />12. Twsited logic. Sounds very good.  I like instrumental part.  8/10 <br /> <br />13.  Hidden track.  Very fresh and different to the rest of the album.  A good surprise. 8/10 <br /> <br />Summarizing, the oustanding tracks for me are: SQUARE ONE, FIX YOU, SPPED OF SOUND, A MESSAGE AND SWALLOWED IN THE SEA.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I was expecting a superficial comedy about a Hispanic woman in an Anglo household.  The reality is much funnier, soul-searching, and beatiful than that. <br /> <br />Adam Sandler was decent in this.  It was beyond his normal range and I thought he handled it quite well.  Cloris Leachman was hilarious as Evelyn.  The little girl who played Cristina was excellent.  Tea Leoni was, quite possibly, the most annoying character in history.  The two people who stole this show were Sandler's daughter Bernie and Flor.  These two female actresses were phenomenal and created all of the emotion of this movie. <br /> <br />In my heart, I wanted John and Flor to end up together.  I wanted John to dump \\"Mrs. Clasky\\" and end up happily with someone he loved and who loved him.  But I also knew that Flor would never want to break up a marriage and that John loved his daughter too much to leave his wife.  It was a heart-wrenching ending, but I thought it stayed true to the characters. <br /> <br />I would give \\"Spanglish\\" 5 stars, but Tea Leoni's character was so annoying that I just had to dock it one star! :) <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After two or three albums that seemed to indicate an increasingly metal-driven sound for Dream Theater, Octavarium is a jaw-dropping surprise... a fantastic return to their progressive roots - yet one that covers all kinds of new ground.  Early Dream Theater showed its influences... Deep Purple, Queensryche, a smattering of Pink Floyd and Zeppelin thrown in for good measure... this new album shows influences from Kansas, Yes, and a bit of Rush and more of that fantastic Pink Floyd sound.  DT manages to take all of this influence and makes it their own sound.  If you are a fan of progressive rock, the title track (Octavarium) will leave you utterly speechless.  It is without a doubt, the best of the best. <br /> <br />Buy this album.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Comparing this album to their last album, De-Loused, is extremely hard to do. They're both their own type of concept albums, showing their own freedom in music. Frances The Mute shows us a more slow paced, lengthier concept to The Mars Volta's music. The songs, having subchapters, give the music a much more complex feel to it, though the tracklisting isn't correct (there are 12 tracks, and WMP, Amazon, and several other sources state 15 tracks) and may bother you for a while. Anyhow, having listened to the album at least 100 times now, I finally decided to write this damned review. <br /> <br />Song 1 - Officially known as: Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus <br />Personal Rating: 5/5 <br />It's an amazing song, with the foreseen mixed languages that TMV has used many times. The song has a punch to it, though, it completely changes, throwing in progressive elements. You see this many times throughout the album. In my opinion, an amazing way to start off an album. <br /> <br />Song 2 - Officially known as: The Widow <br />Personal Rating: 4/5 <br />I personally didn't like it as much as the rest of the album. It was a little out of TMV's way, but it was still an amazing song. The abstract ending didn't suit me so well, and I sometimes felt like going into an audio editing program and simply cuting out the end. It was a little too long, and a little too annoying. It did change the element so you'd be prepared for the next song, but it just got to you in such a way that you wanted to skip track. Amazing song, nevertheless. <br /> <br />Song 3 - Officially known as: L'Via L'Viaquez <br />Personal Rating: 5/5  <br />A nice quick paced, energetic song for TMV. For Cedric to have sung between the mix of languges in this song, I give him whatever's better than credit for making this album something beyond an amazing album to listen to. <br /> <br />Song 4 - Known as: Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore <br />Personal Rating: 5/5 <br />A somewhat different song for TMV. Very quiet, calm, but one nice break up near the end. I almost always listen to this song before going to bed, simply as it makes me want to sleep. It throws in the slow paced element which throws you off, making you not notice what Cassandra will be like, unlike the rest of the album, which continually \\"warns\\" you about the next track. <br /> <br />Songs 5-12 - Known as: Cassandra Gemini <br />Personal Rating: 6/5 <br />Tremendous work put into the song, and I'll say it payed off. Going prog. to all hell on this song, the complexity of all the instruments, the extra instruments used, and various other factors made this song amazing. It is the longest \\"song\\" on the album, lasting 32:32~, but the time doesn't matter with a song like this. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a near perfect album. I would highly recomend it ONLY TO PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO ROCK, PROGRESSIVE, and maybe one or two other genres of music. I wouldn't really recommend it for people who listen to music outside of that range. <br />I hope you found my review useful, and I hope it helped.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|If you've never listened to Avenged Sevenfold before, you need to know a few things.  Each of their albums sounds radically different.  Their first album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was a great start.  It showcased their talent (Which they have plenty of) as musicians, but it left something to be desired.  While the songs were full of skilled musicianship, they lacked good hooks and were a bit chaotic.  Along with mediocre recording (IMO), this made a decent album.  It god people's attention, at least. <br /> <br />Then came Waking the Fallen.  This is probably one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Every single song is powerful in it's own right.  Everything from the first album was there, along with better vocals, better riffs, better hooks, better drumming.  It was just better, and so much better, in fact, that A7X built up quite a fan base.  If you've never heard this band, go listen to all of Waking the Fallen, and be impressed.  The way they mesh hardcore, metal, and punk is flawless on this album.  Their talent is amazing.  The guitarists are simply incredible.  There are few modern bands that can compare to the skill these guys have. <br /> <br />I waited a long time for them to release another album, and here it is.  I listened to this album all the way through many times before I came here to read any reviews, and honestly, I'm shocked.  People don't like it.  I can't figure out why.  Shadows (Vocals) doesn't do any screaming, really.  I liked that better.  The album showcases their talent as a band.  While he doesn't scream, I must admit his vocals on this album can lean towards being annoying at times.  I think something may have happened to his voice.  However, in my opinion that does not detract from the album at all.  As everyone will attest to, the musicianship is incredible, probably their best to date.  It just keeps getting better, in fact.   <br /> <br />City of Evil is the kind of album that grows on you.  When I first heard Waking the Fallen, I was floored by almost every song, the first time through.  Alternatively, City of Evil takes some warming up to.  The first time I listened to every song, I was skeptical.  However, the more I listened, the more I liked it, and I must say now, I think I like this album as a whole better than Waking the Fallen.  This isn't an easy feat.  I'm not going to go through an entire track listing and explain every song to you.  I will just tell you that, if you appreciate good music, this deserves a listen.  Of particular note is the great ending to track 7, \\"Sidewinder\\".  It reminds me a bit of the guitar in the ending to the Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\".  The album as a whole, is just brilliant.  There are a ton of great hooks, even Bat Country (Which no one seems to like) is a good song.  If you're one of those hardcore music nazis that is going to complain because there's less screaming, and the songs aren't as hard, then don't bother listening.  Their sound changed, deal with it.  They're still the same incredible group of musicians they have always been.  Bands evolve, that's part of how music works.  Listen to this album with an open mind, and I guarantee you will be impressed.
B00005R24K|4.0|I finally bought this to get context for reading Bruce Campbell's autobiography \\"If Chins Could Kill.\\"  It's a good movie, and when you watch it knowing it was 1) the first \\"real\\" movie made by these folks (who had previously done a lot of messing around with 8 mm filming) 2) it was done on a budget of less thant $400,000 and 3) its special effects and camera work was made up as they went along, it gets much better.  The acting reeks of Limburger, but it's scary and funny and \\"ferociously original\\" as Stephen King said of it.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Shakira brings us a different sound on this album, she definitely displays her creativity on this project. The songs on this album are very emotional, you can feel the passion behind the lyrics and the vocals. Each song has a different sound, I love every track but my personal favorites are \\"En Tus Pupilas\\", \\"La Pared\\", \\"La Tortura\\", \\"Escondite Ingles\\", \\"No\\", \\"Las De La Intuicion\\" and \\"Lo Imprescindible\\". The over-all feel I get from this album is deep, emotional and dark...it's a super creative emotional rollercoaster ride, definitely a work of art! This album has made me respect Shakira more as an artist, I think she's grown a lot and this album shows it!!!
B00003CXUM|2.0|In the Mood for Love is entirely overrated.  I've been reading the reviews on here in amusement, as people dig beneath the surface for more than there really is.  Call it what you will (\\"evocative,\\" \\"langorous\\"); the film's pace is unbearably slow.  Though it heaps on the ambiguity with meaningful glances, unspoken words, and hesitant gestures, this tentative slowdance wholly failed to move, or even impress, me.  Naturally, as critics would have you, it is \\"exquisitely understated.\\"  Wong Kar-Wai relies on the same techniques over and over again to drive home whatever point he's trying to make -- for example, slow motion shots of the willowy Maggie Cheung gliding down stairs as the violin-and-cello score is cued up.  It's haunting at first.  The 4th time around, it's redundant and self-indulgent.  Tony Leung won a Cannes Best Actor award for his performance, yet he never has to stray from the intense, stoic gravity he brings to most of his other roles.  Chris Doyle's mesmerizing, richly saturated cinematography is the only thing that prevented my eyes from glazing over completely.  Visual beauty, however, is not enough to redeem a film whose center is utterly hollow.  Wong Kar-Wai hints that there's more beneath the surface, but scratch that surface, and all you'll find is an artsy exercise in self-importance.  In short, it's a load of BS that's tempting to analyze to death.
B000001F3C|4.0|Paul \\"Bono Vox\\" Hewson,David \\"The Edge\\" Evans,Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton aka U2,were starting to gain more notoriety in 1983 when this album was released. Hits from this album include SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY and NEW YEAR'S DAY. U2 was formed four years earlier and in 1980,when their debut album BOY was released,they were hardly known in America but famous in their native Dublin,Ireland. This is U2's third album,the second one being OCTOBER,released in 1981. One of their Island records labelmates includes the late Robert Palmer(in the 80's). The band would gain more notoriety with 1984's THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE and 1987's THE JOSHUA TREE,which would be their first megahit.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a novel by Mark Haddon, we all know that. The title is a quotation of a remark made by the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of Silver Blaze.    The story is written as the first-person narrative of Christopher Boone, a teenage boy living in Swindon.    Main character:  Christopher Boone, a fifteen-year-old boy, is the main character in the book. Christopher goes to a school for children with special needs. Though there is no explicit mention of his special need in the book, the publisher's blurb on the back cover of the book says that he has Asperger's syndrome (a condition related to autism).    Plot:  Christopher discovers the murdered body of his neighbour's dog, speared by a garden fork, and decides to investigate. He is severely limited, however, by his own fears and difficulties interpreting the world around him. Throughout all his adventures, Christopher writes a book about the happenings and his experiences, and the book he writes is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.    The story sees Christopher meet people he has never met before (even though they live on the same street as him) for the purposes of his investigation into the dog-murder. He eventually discovers that Mr Shears, who used to live opposite his home, had sex with his mother, whom he believes to be dead as his father explained to him that she died of a heart attack. He chronicles this and other discoveries in his book, and his father becomes rather angry at him when he discovers and reads the book. He hides the book and forbids Christopher to continue any investigation.    In the search for the hidden book, Christopher later discovers letters his mother sent to him that his father had hidden from him for years, and concludes that she is still alive and his father had lied to him. At this point, his father admits that he was the one who killed the dog. Christopher then starts fearing thathis father may also try to kill him, and so, for the rest of the story, he embarks on a most adventurous journey to London, where his mother lives.
B000001FA4|5.0|Around 1980,when U2 landed a contract with Island Records,they put out BOY that same year,OCTOBER the following year,WAR in 1983 and UNDER A BLOODY RED SKY in early 1984. This album,their fifth,spawned the Top 10 hit PRIDE(IN THE NAME OF LOVE) which is an ode to the late Dr. Martin Luther King,the civil rights leader that was shot to death in Memphis on April 4,1968. Frontman Paul \\"Bono Vox\\" Hewson,mentions the date minus the year in the song(\\"Early morning,April 4,a shot rings out in the Memphis sky.\\"). The song was later recorded live in 1987 for 1988's RATTLE AND HUM. Another track on this album is entitled MLK. The title track,4TH OF JULY and A SORT OF HOMECOMING are also memorable tracks. U2's 1987 follow-up,THE JOSHUA TREE would become a megahit inspiring the live tracks recorded for RAH and the documentary film of the same title. One other Irish artist that I know of gained notoriety in the USA and that's the folk band The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Hewson and his three fellow bandmates David \\"The Edge\\" Evans,Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. are still going strong today. Hewson,commonly known as Bono,even makes appearances by himself. I have to admit that this is an unforgettable album.
B0006L16N8|4.0|x&y starts off promising with a more agressive sound- denser backgrounds of droning analog synths and harder guitars. \\"square one\\" is a very good start to a solid album. next a ballad \\"what if\\" starts typical but grows in strength and ends quite differently. But by song three \\" white shadows\\" something strikes as familiar. Is this the edge? Has u2 fired bono and hired martin? Now coldplay have grabbed alittle radiohead pink floyd in the past but the u2 plagarism from the chimy chorus lines to the tomheavy drumming and clayton basslines all circa 1984-85 are so late war unforgettable fire u2 that this is either a lost u2 classic album or the best record theyve made in years. That said- its a cool album with  sonic references to eighties altrockers the fixx- some slight killing joke during their keyboard heavy nightime or brighter than a thousand suns period- some pink floyd and beatles as well. Now these slight influences arent so obvious-and every band copies the past or uses older music- its really unavoidable. But even in interviews the coldplayers have been touting the quest to topple u2- all the while praising the irish rock groups recorded albums- but it seems they decided if you cant beat em join em! No coldplay fan can deny that the u2 sound is allover this album- to the point of replication. I like this album and have liked most of their output to date but feel this needs to be called out. That said its a good album and atleast a slight step foward. iVe been listening to it nonstop for 4 days now and only dislike a song or two. Plus its better than anything u2 has put out in a decade or so. other highlights on the album include x&y-talk-a message- and the bonus track. Ironically brian eno shows up on white shadows - the same eno who produced and played on most u2 records after war. The  \\"talk\\"guitar line is kraftwerk and is credited to the german synthmeisters-perhaps the names of bono-evans-clayton- and mullen should be added to the songwriting credits on some of the other songs. Still its one of the better records out this year.ome of the other songs. Still its one of the better records out this year.
1573223026|5.0|One would think that a book dealing with suicide would be a dark, serious novel preaching prevention and promising that life is worth living.  Hornby has succeeded in breaking that mindset in a novel.  His ability to make a perfect cocktail out of humor, gloominess, and pleasure brings about a great tale.<br /><br />As an author, I can tell you that approaching penning a novel in first person is not the easiest of ways to write.  Doing it through the eyes of four different people makes for a somewhat complicated feat.  Again, Hornby has done so in impressive manner.<br /><br />As the story commences, it is New Year's Eve in London.  True to form, New Year's Eve can bring about such joy to the fortunate, but it rains depression for those that have problems in life.  The end of a year represents the reflection of personal failures.  The four failure reflectors in this case are:  Martin, TV personality that has suffered public humiliation; Maureen, a middle-aged woman who finds herself trapped in a life of caring for her adult son that is severely disabled which as prevented her from building a life of her own; Jess, the poster child of rebellion as an unstable modern day wildside punker with a father making life as a junior government minister; and last but not least, JJ, an American rocker who has had a career come to an abrupt halt so quickly that he wouldn't even make the list of \\"Whatever happen to...\\".<br /><br />This failing foursome meet up on the building in London commonly referred to as \\"Toppers' House\\", where they have arrived with one common goal; to commit suicide.  But a funny thing happens on the way to their ultimate deaths.  Between stories and reflections, the quartet finds a mutual bond to build on and, when morning arrives, they walk away rather than jump to their deaths.  Without every fully realizing it, they end up saving each others' lives from a destiny with no solutions.  As they go off on their separate ways, they understand that what had occurred that night has made them part of a group bonded by a special connection.<br /><br />What happens on that roof is best left for each to read.  But once you have, you will find yourself coming off of the roof feeling better as well.  Hornby has done a great job in this story.  A must read for everyone!<br /><br />Frederick A.

6303477259|5.0|For the absolute best rock concert light and sound experience, look no further than PULSE by Pink Floyd. Recorded back in the mid-90's, this is simply a awesome show, highlighting the extraordinary talents of one the premier art-rock bands of the past millenia. Practically every song has a light show that is not only unique, but visually mesmerizing. I have viewed 100's of concerts, nothing comes even close. In fact, if it has a fault, I can say that it's almost too intense in places, and required several viewings in sections to not become simply overwhelmed at the sheer depth of this fast-moving and complex visual panorama.    I can almost guarantee you'll  be delightfully awe-struck at the intense tapestry of liquid light and techno-flow of gloriouos colors during the opening of \\"Take it back\\", a rollicking song from the latest CD by the band; \\"The Division Bell\\".    As to the debate over VHS vs. DVD, I've practically worn out my original tape and have started a second one. The reproduction on tape is excellent.    Whether you are a fan or not, you have to marvel at the sheer complexity and artistic richness of this epic production. Indeed, an old friend who still calls them \\"Pinky Fluid\\" enjoys the video with the volume muted. \\"Excellent wallpaper or screen-saver, when company comes over\\", he proclaims!     For those of you who are fans of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", this video plays the entire album in a mind-boggling and stunning display of lasers, lights, incredible stage presence and artful playing by the band. Dave Gilmor, lead singer and guitarist has a commanding stage presence, and plays magnificently in harmony with Rick Wright on keyboards and Nick Mason on drums and percussion. Roger Waters is noticable by his absence, although in  tribute, there is a great version of \\"The Wall\\".    This DVD is actually a glowing tribute to the rock concert as a viable art-form of the modern age. For me, it sets the standard for consummate professionalism in sound and video interaction, unparalleled in the field of entertainment. An absolute must-own by videophiles of any taste or persuasion.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I never thought Shakira would do something like this. This is an AMAZING album and I recommend all of you to buy it, very different from Laundry Service, but this is truly what Shakira is about. A little bit of rock, pop, Colombian music, reggeaton, Brazilian music and more. After more than 7 years without an all-Spanish album, Shakira comes back with a bomb...if you thought \\"LaTortura\\" was good, wait until you listen to the whole album. <br />Best songs in the album are: <br />1. En tus pupilas <br />2. La pared <br />3. La tortura <br />6. Escondite Ingles <br />7. No <br />8. Lo Imprescindible <br />
B000002LCK|5.0|Aside from the generous outpouring of talent, Substance has personal meaning for me, evoking fond memories of my teen years.  I was lent a copy of Substance on cassette in the eighth grade, from a friend.  It absolutely blew me away.  I had never heard something so... it's hard to describe.  Electronic?  Mechanical?  Sublime?  My only prior exposure to New Order was hearing Bizarre Love Triangle once or twice on the radio.  Sure, I had heard other new wave songs on the radio, and championed The Cure as my very favorite band.  But nothing like this.  After getting through Ceremony, I was floored by Everything's Gone Green, and by every track after it.<br /><br />For those of us who cut our New Order teeth on this compilation album, we can't imagine a better version.  The hardcore fans lament the loss of the original versions of some of the songs, but for those of us who didn't ever hear those versions, the Substance mixes ARE the originals (if that makes sense).<br /><br />Really, from Temptation on, you are almost convinced that this is an original album, rather than a best-of recording.  The only other best-of recording that meshes the singles this well is Madonna's Immaculate Collection (don't laugh).<br /><br />Substance shows us the diversity of moods and styles within New Order.  These range from dreamy (Thieves Like Us) to upbeat (Subculture) to urgent (State of the Nation) to anthemic (Blue Monday, Bizarre Love Triangle).  It's a shame to know that the electronic style that New Order refined had lost its soul by the mid-nineties.  The only credible electronica from that period was a mix of electronica and alternative.<br /><br />Substance is one of maybe five or ten pop recordings that I can pull out every couple of years and fall in love with all over again. After Substance, there is only one more \\"classic\\" New Order album, which is Technique.  Republic has its moments of genius, but this isn't the vinyl 12-inch New Order sound anymore.<br /><br />For those who noted that the second disc is a rather faceless affair (save 1963), it doesn't matter.  The first disc is the treasure trove we will cherish for our lifetimes.rather faceless affair (save 1963), it doesn't matter.  The first disc is the treasure trove we will cherish for our lifetimes.
1410102033|5.0|Amazon has set up this feature so that the book in question may be reviewed. This is not your shrink's couch. <br /> <br />Having reviewed the reviews, I have to say that most of them are not helpful at all. First I read about how Mein Kampf accurately portrays the horrors of socialism, which -- as any educated person would know -- is complete nonsense. (For the reviewer who wrote that: You should know that Nazi Germany is the quintessential example of a RIGHTIST dictatorship.) <br /> <br />And then, I just read just emotional reactions to the Holocaust. Thanks, I'm sure we're all very well aware of how horrific the Jewish Holocaust was. But if you haven't even read the book, why the hell are you \\"reviewing it\\"?? <br /> <br />*SIGHS* Now, to the book itself: <br /> <br />I know any review of Mein Kampf is a blatant redundancy. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this work for the understanding of one of the most unsettling and significant political and sociological phenomena of recent history. <br /> <br />A crucial read to any student of poli sci, as well as psych and sociology.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I really like this movie. While there isn't a great plot, it's so stylish and beautifuly done it's hard not to enjoy. But, in what is quickly becoming a tradition in Hollywood, the studio plans on releasing this and then a two-disc special edition several months later. Talk about greed! If I were you, I'd wait. If you really love the movie, why not rent it or watch it On Demand in the meantime?
0156029065|2.0|Baudolino utters this remark 400 pages into this 500-page anything-but-a-quick-read.  You kind of wish Eco had spared us the history and mythology surrounding Baudolino's life by mentioning this a little sooner.    This book is a chore.  Some of the history is interesting, but the overriding themes about false faith and effort in vain make the reader question the task of plowing through the book.    If you're a big history buff, there might be enough in here to keep you interested.  However, if you liked Eco's Name of The Rose and you're hoping this will be as good, forget it and pass this one over.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was an incredibly well-acted, well-written and well-directed series ( What else would you expect from Joss?), that never got a chance to shine. Fox, as usual, had something wonderful on their hands, and managed to scew things up, which is a trademark of theirs. Even this single season is able to stand on it's own, with remarkable visuals and an outstanding cast. Give Joss Whedon credit, he always finds amazing actors, even for background and single-line guest stars. His direction is, as always, brilliant, and right on the money. Viewing this dvd set leaves you wanting more, which is great, as the feature film is supposed to debut in September, 2005. This series has something for everyone: Humor, action, pathos, great special effects, quality writing, and much more. It truly was a delight to see, and belongs in your dvd collection!
B000001ELP|4.0|In the catalog of KISS albums,along with a few of their other albums,there is one album by the group that remains controversial. What album is that? That album is \\"Music From The Elder\\",KISS' first and only concept record. When this record was released in 1981,things were going bad for KISS-even though their most recent studio albums(\\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Unmasked\\")had sold well and had a hit song off of both records,problems were arising in the band,and \\"Dynasty\\" was a foray into disco while \\"Unmasked\\" sounded more like a pop album than it did a rock album. And to top everything off,drummer Peter Criss had been fired from the group. So,with drummer Eric Carr taking over Criss and Bob Ezrin behind the sound board,KISS would make their first and only concept record. How would the record turn out? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This album,while it is not a masterpiece,is not horrible either.The safer road for KISS would have been to release a concept album similiar to concept record artists like Alice Cooper and Pink Floyd had released-but KISS agreed with Bob Ezrin(who had produceed their classic \\"Destroyer\\" record)and decided to go for a totally different musical climate(after Bob Ezrin suggested a concept album that would be different from their other records and a vote was taken,Ace Frehley voted no to the idea;however Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,and Bob Ezrin voted yes and since Eric Carr was not an original band member,he was not allowed to vote). <br /> <br />Anyway,on to the album. It pretty much tells the story of a boy wanting to become a hero,and a group of people,the Elder, who want a champion to conquer evil..and there is a certain boy wants to do it. I won't give away everything,because if you buy this album on CD,You'll see the story for the album inside the liner notes.As for the music on this CD,there are a few lackluster moments here(\\"Fanfare\\",\\"Just a Boy\\",and \\"Odyssey\\")however,the rest is pretty good.It is a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" record.Like Ialready said,when KISS made this record,they really branched out. Before he was a member of KISS,Eric Carr had,believe it or not,been in several disco club bands in New York City using his real name(Paul Caravello)so if You already know that when you listen to this album for the first time,You may have even more of a surprise in store for you(for more info on the thing about Eric Carr that I just mentioned,get \\"The Tale Of The Fox\\" documentary that was released about Eric Carr's life,Amazon and kissshop.com has it). Also,Velvet Underground member Lou Reed came in to co-write a few tracks on here(\\"Dark Light\\",\\"A World Without Heroes\\",and \\"Mr.Blackwell\\")which is another reason why this album is so different(as well as good).My favorite songs are:\\"A World Without Heroes\\",\\"Mr. Blackwell\\",\\"The Oath\\",and \\"I\\". <br /> <br />Give this album a listen.Sure,it is not the best album KISS has ever released,and it may be different from their other albums-but that's not the point. The point is that this is a good album on it's own. You may have to give this album a few listens to get into it,and there may be times when you are in the mood for it and times when you are not in the mood for it,but this album has kind of become a lost gem like Motley Crue's self-titled grunge album with John Corabi on lead vocals and the debut album by Montrose(Sammy Hagar's post Van Halen band). You may love it,and you may hate it,but either way,it is worth hearing at least once.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Prisoner of Azcaban is my favorite Harry Poter book yet.  Seeing this movie was an incredible disapointment even compared to the other movies that have come out.  It strayed immensly from the book and I don't think that they should even attempt to make Goblet of Fire.  To make a movie of a book that is so long and so brilliantly written when a decent one cannot be made of a book that is half it's length will crush any avid Harry Poter fan.  The attempts to turn the Harry Poter books into box office hits like the Lord of the Rings is futile and a waste of time.
B00000AF98|4.0|KISS'fourth album without their make-up,\\"Crazy Nights\\",is one of their best non-make-up albums. Some KISS fans hate it,some like it,and some needed to give it a few listens before they got into it.Want my opinion of it? Then read on for my review of this and I'll give you my thoughts,comments,and opinions for every track on here: <br /> <br />\\"Crazy,Crazy,Nights\\"-A good way to open an album,and a really good feel good song-I would say that this song is definitely one of the best hair metal songs ever written. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\"-Not bad,but not outstanding either-a little weird but it's a really good \\"love\\" song from Paul Stanley(as well as Bruce Kulick and Adam Mitchell,who co-wrote this track).7/10 <br /> <br />\\"Bang Bang You\\"-The 80's version of \\"Love Gun\\"-not as fast paced as that song(\\"Love Gun\\")is,but pretty cool. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"No,No,No\\"-Sounds like a typical song from Gene Simmons-the concept to the song is really cool,and,like Gene Simmons has said in real life(this is a line in the song and [...] listed it as one of Simmons' quotes for his biography on there)\\"It's a Dirty Job but Somebody's Got To Do It\\". 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Hell Or High Water\\"-This track was also sung by Gene Simmons,and really,while it is not one of KISS' best songs,it is one of the best KISS songs that Gene has sung.I like the concept-a guy goes insane when his wife/girlfriednd(song does not say which)is gone for a few days-a very impressive song;I like the way it is sung. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"My Way\\"-Another feel good song that is sung with a lot of confidence-this is a cool track.6.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"When Your Walls Come Down\\"-This song is absolutely HILLARIOUS!!!!!!!! Paul Stanley sings it from the point of view of an ex-boyfriend who has just had a rocky breakup with his pyscho,snotty ex-girlfriend-this song cracks me up. With lyrics like \\"You got your script from a cosmo guide;15 Ways To Find a Lover;don't make me chase you 'cause the author lied\\",you will probably be cracking up during this song,enjoying it,and if You've been in the same situation that this song sings about(which I have,trust me)then You'll probably like this song even more than you liked it the first time you heard it. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Reason To Live\\"-This is the best track on the whole album. It is about guy who has had problems with his girlfriend and now she has gone kind of crazy(not mentally,check out the video supporting this album,the video for this song is on there)and overall,it is a really great song with a really great meaning to it. There is one word I can use to describe this song:wonderful. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\"-A typical Gene Simmons songs that is a step-up from \\"Girl Gone Bad\\" off of the last album that Van Halen recorded with David Lee Roth,\\"1984\\".8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Turn On The Night\\"-This ballad was written by Paul Stanley and Diana Warren,and I like the attitude and passion in this song-the lyrics were wonderfully written and Paul Stanley did an excellent job singing it. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Thief In The Night\\"-The last track on this album that,while it was originally written/recorded for Wendy O. Williams' \\"W.O.W.\\" album(Gene Simmons produced that album)is this time done by KISS. Again,not outstanding,but listenable. 7.25/10 <br /> <br />Bottom Line:Buy this album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0767903862|5.0|This was a great introduction to Australia full of stories and anecdotes that are crazy and very specific but from which you can get a great general sense of Australia. I read the book to prepare for a move to Australia, and it served me well. Anyone interested in the country, and certainly anyone planning on a holiday down under, would love this book.  Easy to read yet full of good stuff.
B0000640VN|4.0|There are many errors with this film.  The time travel concept is not very well explained.  One reviewer pointed out the La Boheme error, there are several others (including the whole elevator bit).  But why nit-pick this movie, which is touching and cute?  It is a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy that touches the heart without going for the tears.  I do agree with those about Meg Ryan being past the cute ingenue stage, but I am glad they didn't cast some young, sexy bombshell for what was supposed to be a woman who has already established herself in an executive role.  Maybe Kate Hudson was busy.
B0000004V2|5.0|Someone said it earlier and it is completely true - this album gets better and better after every listen.  It is a truly rewarding experience to listen to this album, whether it is your first time or your hundredth (which I am approaching).  As others have mentioned, this was the album that paved the way for Oasis, the Verve, Pulp (to a degree), Radiohead (also to a degree), Blur, and many other of the so-called \\"Brit Pop\\" bands.<br /><br />\\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" may be the greatest opening track ever and then there is the sheer brilliance of \\"Waterfall\\" running into \\"Don't Stop\\" (they play a part of \\"Waterfall\\" backwards).  Ian Brown, John Squire, Reni, and Mani came together one day and for that moment, they laid down some music that was never going to be equalled, no matter how hard they tried.  \\"Second Coming\\" (which was a belated 5 year follow-up) is solid but no where near the album that \\"The Stone Roses\\" is.  But how could it have been?  \\"The Stone Roses\\" was an album to perfection.<br /><br />Everyone who is into rock music or just music period needs this album in your collection.  You don't have a serious collection without this one.  I own over 1100 CDs and if I had to choose 5 albums to save from a fire, this one is there along with \\"A Tribute to Jack Johnson\\" by Miles, \\"Ultimate Blue Train\\" by Coltrane, \\"Animals\\" by Pink Floyd, and \\"Disintegration\\" by The Cure.  Buy it today if you don't own it already.
B001EN71DG|2.0|The theatrical version is probably the worst transfer to dvd currently available on the market.  The VHS and Laserdisc versions look better because the media was optimized for use on that particular equipment.  The current dvd theatrical release of the original Star Wars, was not correctly formatted for dvd. As a result, the transfer makes the film look older than the dvd release of 'Forbidden Planet' made in 1956.   Look at the dvd release of Star Trek 1.  What you have here is the correct balance between restoration and artistic integrity.  There's no need to add anything to it, and in doing so take away the original effect and power of the film.  Lucasfilm cannot grasp this concept.   So once again, the Star Wars fan has to put up with the incompetence of a multi million dollar corporation, in an effort to rediscover the works of a now deceased young visionary, by the name of George Lucas.  Apparently the originals will never be restored.  I'll be hanging on to this for now, but when I locate a good fan edit, I'll be buying that.  The Lucasfilm corporation has now earned my disrespect.
0440419514|5.0|Many others have reviewed at length the beautifully-woven story and captivating style of His Dark Materials. Your empathy with these characters and your immersion into their world grow with the sheer scale - it is the only story to ever move me to tears at the end.  <br /> <br />On its own, the depth and uniqueness of the world and the characters would more than hold their own against such undeniable classics as The Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series, unburdened by the former's flood of detail or the latter's prosaicism; the story is a nearly-perfect fusion of creativity, epic and allusion. <br /> <br />But what really puts this trilogy a step above its rivals is that the faerie-tale is only the avatar of a deep and very *real* ideology. The allegory is the binding element that takes it beyond a mere story in a way that others seemed to stumble over, transforming His Dark Materials into a single, complete entity that is, in a word, sublime. <br /> <br />The trilogy should probably not be read by children younger than thirteen or fourteen - its dark and graphical nature aside, I don't think many children are able to fully appreciate its total scope (largely for reasons that the books themselves explain). <br /> <br />Otherwise, though, I recommend it to anyone and everyone, including Christians. I want to put to death the notion that these books are some kind of an attack on Christians, which I find to be incredibly selfish. Christianity is a philosophy and ideology, and His Dark Materials challenges it - Pullman is simply standing up and saying \\"I have a different idea!\\" It's an opportunity for Christians to step back for a moment and *think* about their beliefs, and look at them a little differently. Religion, like any idea, deserves to be tested and questioned - and if it is truly the right one, then it will come out on the other side with twice the strength and stability. I think that reading books like His Dark Materials is just as important as readingthe Bible. Faith is much more powerful when doubt has been conquered than when there was no doubt to begin with. <br /> <br />And as for the story? It's all fiction, of course! It's understandable if its being based on the Christian Church and God is a bit disturbing - ironic, considering that the elements of Middle-Earth and Narnia are even more heretical, yet were written by devout Christians. But in the end it's simply a beautiful story that stirs the emotions and the imagination - the kind of experience that everyone deserves to have at least once in their lifetime.
0143034901|4.0|Though not in a book club as referenced in Isiet's review, and thus not having had the luxury of bouncing my reactions against other readers, I must say that while I really, really enjoyed The Shadow of the Wind, the end did disappoint just a bit.  To have so many of the eventual resolutions revealed in a lengthy, posthumous letter was a device that, to me anyway, jarred me just a bit and took away from the flow of the rest of the story.  I did rather like the way everything was tied up at the very end as to how everyone fared several years after the main events.  When reading books, I often consider \\"I wonder what happened to those characters in their lives after the events of the book\\"; this book is one of the few that dared to answer that question so I felt like there was complete closure in my mind for all of the characters.  So, despite my lukewarm reaction to the critical letter device, the rest of the book was a terrific and enjoyable read.  I really cared about the characters and could envision myself on the streets of Barcelona.  Enough so that I look forward to reading more of Zafon's work.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I wish I had known that George Lucas had made MORE changes to this DVD boxed set.  While the changes are not that extreme (some of them you wouldn't notice unless you're a huge fan) I feel that the redubbing and re-recording of scenes with the new actors from the prequels does a discredit to the people who originally played those rolls.  Where would it end?  Why not cut out the muppet Yoda completely and add in the CGI Yoda instead?  Why not rerecord all of Obi-Wans scenes with Ewan McGregor?  George Lucas should release  either the original movies (not special editions) on DVD or just the special editions on DVD without the redubs and add-ins.  Also put warnings on the boxed sets that lets people know they are not getting the originals or the special editions but the messed around with special editions.
B00080ZG10|2.0|This film is a total disappointment-and a big waste of time. Leo's portrayal of Howard Hughes did not get my attention. Hughes' life was enormous than life itself. He was a major player, a risk-taker, and a gambler. He was america's first billionaire who turned dreams into reality,and later He lived a reclusive life. He was the man who went all out to spend his money, investing it on movies, airplanes, & aviation. Long before \\"Jaws\\", \\"Hells Angels\\" was the first blockbuster film that was ever made-And Hughes used most of his money to produce this film. If was'nt for Hughes, there would'nt be technology that would lift us up to the clouds. Howard Hughes was a true innovator.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I totally understand the people that don't like the vocals on this album. The singer seems to be singing through his nose or something. He also has a hard time reaching tough notes as opposed to Waking the Fallen where the vocals were just increadible. I think his recent throat injury scraped his voice.  <br /> <br />However, I must say that, after about 10 listens, I actually love his voice on that record. I'm just addicted to the songs and I love this record. Even with Shadow's limited voice now, A7X managed to produce an insane album. These guys are real genius. I mean, all the songs are a lot different from each other and they are all different from Waking the Fallen. What more can you ask for ? If they repeated Waking the Fallen style, everyone would have blamed them for sticking with the same successful formula. Now they take risks with new approaches, still people are spitting on their effort.   <br /> <br />This album is refreshing. A7x is without a doubt my favorite band of all time. All their songs get catchy at some point. The beauty of A7x is that the songs are not that good when you hear them at first, but after a couple listens you start hearing new stuff to which you didn't pay attention before and you finally get addicted.  <br /> <br />I'm not here to tell people to buy this record. I don't care. Everyone has different tastes and you cannot change anyone. What I can say though is that lots of people listen to the album only once and go straight at their PC to right a destructive review about the record. Why don't give a couple of listens before doing that ? Over the years listening to lots and lots of music I realized that my favorites albums are the ones I didn't like at first. That's the beauty of music.  <br /> <br />In brief, in my opinion, City of Evil is Avenged Sevenfold's 2nd Masterpiece and I could not tell yet if it's better or not than Waking the Fallen, only time will tell.  <br /> <br />I just hope A7X will remain for many years to come.  <br />

B00097A5I6|5.0|Trust me, I did not have high expectations for this CD after the past couple CDs and the single \\"Lyla\\" but this has really grown on me and ranks,to me, right behind Def Maybe and Morning Glory.  Don't get me wrong, it is not as good as those 2 but this is really a great CD on its own.  I can't believe the one review that said this is their worst?!?!  Andy Bell's songs on this are amazing.  Gem's songs are okay and probably are the weakest.  Anyway, try it out and listen to it a few times.  It really is a solid CD.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Well this cd sucked.  I didn't even feel like buying it i just borrowed and then puked into a toliet shortly after. If you like toxicity, then you probable won't like this one because it is nothing like the SOAD that i'm used to. The songs all have good intros then they go all weird and getting really \\"crunchy\\". So if your into smoking a lot of weed then buy this album. Especially on #2, wow this is the song for all of the hippies. \\"Take down the man, down with the war machine, ah man i am so high!\\"
B00003CX9E|1.0|Citizen Kane is absolutely excrutiating from start to finish. Obviously what they forgot to put in this film is 'ENTERTAINMENT'.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is an insightful and finely crafted documentary with a comprehensive overview of the events leading up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It is a truly great film and should be distributed and shown widely.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I would have paid more than the retail asking price for this CD. It's just that good. This album is a discount considering all the great songs you get. This album is worth it's weight in either Gold or Platinum. X&Y sounds like a rare diamond, a priceless jewel.  <br /> <br />Each time SQUARE ONE begins, I feel like I'm being swept away on a cloud. Like another reviewer said, this album makes you feel like you're floating. And you could stay in the sky forever as long as Coldplay is navigating. The destination will surely inspire all kinds of awe.  <br /> <br />One newspaper article said that Chris Martin didn't know how to write a bad song. I am thoroughly convinced that is the truth. Coldplay as a whole just works so well together. They're a great team. Every band member's contribution is important. They really pulled together to create an outstanding piece of music. <br />
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  I don't consider myself much of a reader, but this is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone. <br /> <br />Life of Pi is great fiction.  It comes with a story that is almost unbelievable, but after awhile, you find yourself drawn in and basically end up living the story with Pi.   <br /> <br />I don't want to say a whole lot about the plot, other than to read it.  I found it a little slow-going for about the first 100 pages, but it definitely took off from there.   <br /> <br />Life of Pi is almost a religious experience in a book.  It's that good!  Fantastic fiction.  Great storytelling.  Thank you Yann Martel.  Buy it!
0140277447|5.0|I really liked this book.  I had read smaller comments about the Rape of Nanking, but this was my first larger and systematic book on the subject.  The presentation is very clear and adapted for those with little background in the area.   <br /> <br />The history of what takes place is very ... strong, and the author does clearly allows us to see where her biases are. I found the narrative very good and informative, but the pictures also included in the book are what truly brings home the magnitude of what happened (needless to say you should keep this away from small children, the pictures are quite gastly, including victims of beheading and etc).  It is like the descriptions of the Holocaust which never seem to capture reality as well as pictures since the reality is almost unimaginable. <br /> <br />I thought initially the author had been too harsh in her closing comments of Japanese views and public education on the events surrounding the Rape of Nanking, but after speaking to a few young Japanese students about this I understood the author is indeed addressing an actual cultural event.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|If you like their 1st cd you should try move your body by marshall jeffereon instead or maybejust a trax records compilation. Chicago house inspired it. <br /> <br />If you like the second cd you should try finding a larry levan mix , a song called changes by imagination, or maybe even some old salsoul. \\"Garage\\" may have inspired it <br /> <br />If you like this album you should try listening to a track called night drive through babylon (aka time space transmat) by MODEL 500 instead or any techno from detroit. try looking into some detroit labels like metroplex, UR, electrofunk, MAP, or direct beat. Detroit techno inspired this album.  <br /> <br />If you like all the music they make you might also want to check out some cheesy Italo like Magic Fly by Space or Passion by the Flirts. Everything they they do sounds like italo or some sort of fatboy slim crap. <br /> <br />Daft punk is pure cheese. Thats the whole point of the music they make.  they lovingly mock the music that inspired them. Their music has no soul and little substance  beyond its sillyness and tackyness. If you like corny/wacky music then this should be your bag. I cant think of any music with more camp value than daft punk. Theres  nothing wrong with camp if you get a kick out of it.   <br />
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath was one of those mysterious figures in twentieth century literature whose work I had never read...until now. This is one of those rare novels that is arresting from the first page to the last, not least because of its obvious autobiographical nature, in its thinly veiled descriptions of characters drawn from Plath's life during a six month period in her early twenties, primarily in the character of Esther herself. Plath indicated after the novel was written that this work was autobiographical, with only the addition of a little fiction to give it a little more colour. We witness the descent into herself of a compelling literary character, one in whom the seeds of melancholy reside deeply. The society girl who does not quite fit in, not feeling fully connected with her friends, her boyfriend, or herself. One who has a mother who is remote, a father who died while she was a young girl; a younger brother who is absent. She disconnects further, and we see the marks of a deep depression descend on her, as she starts to withdraw from life into her solitude, and a wretched one at that. Depression and sleeplessness and hopelessness overtake her and she goes through the motions of therapy, treatment, being committed to an asylum, electro-shock treatment, a pervasive obsession with death and suicide, and ultimately, several attempts to end her life. This would be great fiction if indeed the sadness of its direct parallels to Plath's life were not present. Some of her descriptions are deeply disturbing, in a way that I have only otherwise encountered in someone like Augusten Burroughs (a present day writer of a similarly harrowing memoir, \\"Running With Scissors\\"). In any event, this novel is further truth that some of history's finest writers and artists are also among those most tortured and unhappy.     Not a happy read at all, rather one that left me with an overwhelming sadness, but filled with appreciation for its beauty and strength. Despite her early departure from this earth (Plath ended her life shortly after the publication of \\"The Bell Jar\\"), this work, along with her collections of poetry, remains and keeps her alive to those who read her words.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Much has been made of Martin Scorcese's recreation of heyday Hollywood and his account of American aviation in its infancy. It is much ado about something, something quite grand. The life around which Scorcese has built his long biopic, that of the young billionaire Howard Hughes, before he became an excentric recluse, is less interesting than the times in which he lived. But no matter. This is great fun most of the time, and it contains one of the most exciting plane crashes ever filmed.    That crash sequence, brilliantly editied by Thelma Schoonmaker (she won an Oscar, one of five the picture earned) is one of several painstaking set pieces that reveal Scorcese's love of movie craftsmanship. His reputation now rests not so much on his early revelations of urban angst but rather on departures like his \\"Cape Fear\\" remake, \\"The Age of Innocence\\" and now \\"The Aviator.\\" The director knows how to walk the mean streets of other landscapes as well.    The casting is impeccable save for Leonardo DiCaprio; he's game but does not resemble the brash Hughes in looks, style, voice or authority. Two of the actresses in his life, Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsole), are treated as savvy and compassionate women who tire of his odd behavior. John C. Reily is solid as his steadfast accolyte. There is also fine work from Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and Willem DaFoe in a brief unbilled appearance.    Scorcese increases Hughes' obessive-compulsive behavior in increments that suggest the nutcase he will become after the picture ends. That ending, which intercuts a Senate hearing he dominated with the maiden flight of The Spruce Goose, is fitting and deepened by a sad coda showing Hughes slipping into the psychosis that would isolate him until his death. How many big budget Hollywood epics end like that and still make a lot of money at the box office?
B0006399FS|1.0|I bought this album thinking that it would redeem my faith in the talents of U2.  It failed to do anything but put me to sleep.  It is the same guitar sound over and over again with Bono wailing into the microphone.  They have lost their ability to capture my attention.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|IMHO, this album's music & chorus is stronger than the vocals. The soaring, angry, fantastic feel of songs such as \\"the Promise\\" and \\"Mother Earth\\" are absent here. Sharon den Adel seems to sing much tamer, what many fans have criticised as being a \\"Sell-out\\" indicator. I don't agree that Within Temptation is sounding more like Evanesence (for one, den Adel sings better!). Instead we have fantasy mixed with consistently \\"standard\\" sounding rock vocals, and Pat Benatar (not that that's necessarily a bad thing) came forth to mind upon hearing many of the songs on this disc. The downer is that here Sharon den Adel is sounding much too American. <br />Having liked their previous albums, I was left wanting for a cutting loose of wild, emotional vocals, but to no satisfaction. There is less Goth in the voice of this Silent Force and that's a pity. We come close in \\"Jillian (I'd Give my Heart)\\" but it's not enough for this fan. <br /> <br />Still this is definitely worth a buy. The chorus creates a wonderful atmosphere that this fantasy lover revels in.

B00000IBRI|4.0|A few months back, I saw my first Dario Argento film, Suspiria, a creepy little thriller that looked great, sounded great and had a flawed but passable story.  Phenomena, my second exposure to Argento, has similar qualities but is a slightly inferior movie.<br /><br />Like Suspiria, this movie focuses on an American female who is sent to an eerie boarding school in Central Europe.  In this case, Jennifer Connelly (in one of her earliest starring roles) plays Jennifer, the teenaged daughter of a wealthy but completely absent father who has sent her off to a Swiss boarding school.  Jennifer has a psychic affinity with insects which help provide her clues about a local serial killer.<br /><br />Donald Pleasance is a wheelchair-bound scientist who befriends Jennifer and assists her in investigating the killer.  Fortunately, the killer likes to keep parts of the bodies, attracting flies which help Jennifer.<br /><br />Although the acting and writing is not very good (Connelly is still a good decade away from her Oscar caliber work), the movie makes up for it with the direction, settings and soundtrack by Goblin (who were even more effective in Suspiria) and various other musicians such as Iron Maiden and Bill Wyman.  If you don't like bugs; this isn't the movie for you; in particular, this is one of the most maggot-filled movies ever.  Otherwise, this is an effective - if minor - horror movie that merits watching.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|simply maidens worst album, along with brave new world, actually anything after 'seventh son' is their worst.
B00005KHJM|3.0|There are those who would say that The Wicker Man is a cult classic of horror cinema.  This is somewhat misleading as this movie is only superficially horror and not really good enough to merit classic status.   <br /> <br />The movie follows Edward Woodward as a Scottish police detective who visits an isolated island in search of a missing girl.  The islanders are happily non-cooperative, misleading Woodward first into thinking that the girl doesn't exist and then providing vague answers as to her fate.  At the same time, the detective - a priggishly devout Christian - is offended to find that the whole island has gone completely pagan, complete with fertility rituals and sacrifices; in fact, he comes to believe the missing girl is the victim of such a sacrifice. <br /> <br />While somewhat intriguing - enough to merit a weak three stars - there are significant problems with this film.  Made in the early 1970s, this movie does not age well, with a directing style that is distinctly of that era.  The music - and this may be one the most musical \\"horror\\" movies ever - is also very dated.   <br /> <br />Woodward's character is rather unsympathetic, an uptight and sexually repressed zealot who is completely intolerant of the islanders.  Christopher Lee, as the lord of the island, is much more entertaining and likeable.  This leads to a somewhat ambivalent ending.  But the big problem with the movie is that the conclusion hinges on an almost improbable level of manipulation, destroying much of the plausibility the rest of the story has developed. <br /> <br />As stated before, this movie is only minimally horror.  In fact, it is really only a mystery, and not one with much suspense.  From a violence standpoint, it is quite tame, although the sexual content clearly is R-rated.  Of course, most kids would probably be bored by this film, which focuses more on ideas than action.  The Wicker Man is an interesting movie - certainly not without merit - but also skippable. <br/>
0736041850|5.0|I would have loved to have this book when I was a medical student and later, when I taught medical students as well. An incredibly useful and illustrative demonstration of the muscles involved in all weight training exercises (from push ups to barbell shrugs) and beyond. Traditional medical anatomy books all get lost in the \\"insertion point, anchoring point\\" details, losing the life, the actual physical role of muscles. The illustrations from this book should be enlarged and displayed in every gym that truly cares about its members. Plus, you can see that there are no magic moves, strengthening tricks appearing monthly in men's magazines or infomercials (Ab-trekk-flexx and whatever). A muscle is a muscle and what and how it does is clearly shown in this book.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|You are mistaken when you wrote about how implausible a plot it was for a Roman Emperor to end up fighting a gladiator in the Colloseum.  As a matter of fact, the real Emperor Commodus did routinely fight animals and hapless slaves in the area.

B000002KIE|5.0|Never Mind The Bollocks, at the time of its release certainly offered Britain a completely different sound(even though punk was arising), a malicious lead singer with revolting, absurd lyrical suggestions amongst vicious power chord riffs, and heavy drum clashes. A less respected genre in musical culture, bombarded by present day groups like Sum 41 and Blink 182, punk has a certain motivative, angry hook to it, that these new bands don't carry in their music. I won't criticize the music of these new age bands, however, the music itself lacks the emotional bloodiness that groups like the Sex Pistols and The Ramones experimented with in this cult following genre.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols certainly had a great deal of influence on the punk nation, with their ridiculous, anarchist outcries on society. Nevertheless, the album shot to number 1, prompted by the hit Anarchy In the U.K., a bloody punk-rocker, with surreal lyrical deliveries and an obvious lethargy of music surroundings.  The album, as a whole, is packed with pretentious musicality which has strong, intense riffs at times, with powerful drums. Holidays In The Sun is a fierce opener, followed by the savaged, profane lyrics of Bodies, with Johnny Rotten expressing the words: \\"...Body screaming f#$king bloody mess...\\". Generally inaudible lyrical deliveries, but No Feelings has Rotten using a voice twisting delivery in the chorus, making it a more memorable track. A strong riff opens Liar, and is much more rock n' roll style in musicality. Repetitive lyrics begin each verse to this song rather effectively. Problems has a lower key riff, expressing an irritated train of thought in the song, featuring heavy drums, and a ranting Johnny Rotten. A heavy perspective of the British nation, with a depressing lyrical trend is part of what makes God Save The Queen a success, easily a standout track amongst the righteousness of Never Mind The Bollocks. However, the guitar riff is an obvious must for the song, giving the song more substance, slightly set apart by Rottens' assurance that there is: \\"...no future for you.\\" Seventeen is highlighted by another riff, with awesome drum runs, truly a grinding powerhouse song. Anarchy In The U.K. has a fierce opening, with an intoxicating lyrical delivery from the lead singer, in a higher pitch, making it one of the most superb punk songs in the history of the genre, actually featuring smooth background ensemble singing effectively, with a raunching guitar riff. Submission is more of a bass driven(by none other than the master Sid Vicious), deeper song with fairly memorable drives of punk force in the chorus. Pretty Vacant lacks variety and style, and has nothing driving it forward. New York is an effort to get the album back on track, beginning with heavy drums and an intimidating lyrical delivery running throughout the song. EMI ends the album with a vengeance, another obvious standout, brushing along the lines of Anarchy In The U.K., with a simple guitar riff, persuasive lyrics, sheer compelling dynamics in the middle of the song lead to the ultimate highlight though, a smashing 10 second guitar hook.<br /><br />Overall, a solid, consistent punk album, influencing the genre drastically built from a profuse sound of sadistic lyrics, trendy, venomous guitar hooks, and smashing drums(possibly the ultimate highlight). I picked up this album for an exploration into further music genres, having never accumulating a great deal of interest towards the genre. An absolute must for punk fans, and highly recommended to those who look to deepen their music reservoir. Also recommended in the punk category is music by The Ramones, Iggy Pop, and The Damned.more substance, slightly set apart by Rottens' assurance that there is: \\"...no future for you.\\" Seventeen is highlighted by another riff, with awesome drum runs, truly a grinding powerhouse song.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|One of the most original releases of the year (along with the Mars Volta) System of a Down's latest is worth the wait. I've been waiting for this album ever since I heard \\"Steal this Album\\", and the wait was well worth it, good, funny, lyrics, better drumming, and way better guitarmanshio, this is clearly one of the frontrunners for best of 2005 (along with Trivium and a7x). <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Intro (Nice intro, goes well into BYOB)    <br />2. B.Y.O.B. - 5/5 (Great opener, catchy lyrics, score will probably go down soon, because of airplay)    <br />3. Revenga- 4/5 (another good song, great musicianship, a bit catchy as well)     <br />4. Cigaro- 4/5 (I think this song is probably their funniest, not a serious song at all)    <br />5. Radio/Video- 4/5 (A good song, nothing spectacular)   <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song- 4/5 (Just a fast pace, old school SOAD song)    <br />7. Violent Pornography- 5/5 (Funny song, but the chorus has to be the most catchiest of all-time)  <br />8. Question! - 4/5 (Probably my least favorite, stellar none the less)   <br />9. Sad Statue- 5/5 (Good lyrics and vocals on this one)  <br />10. Old School Hollywood- 4/5 (This song brings memories of \\"Mr. Roboto\\" by styx, but way better than anything they have done)   <br />11. Lost in Hollywood- 5/5 (Great closer, and something I didnt expect, a beautifully written song, good job on this one) <br /> <br />Look for \\"hypnotize\\" later this year <br />

B00015TOCY|3.0|Eno's \\"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)\\" is the followup and logical successor to \\"Here Comes the Warm Jets\\".  Continuing its structure of off-kilter pop, it is a somewhat more varied and at the same time more focused album, albiet a touch less successful-- \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" has an edge and adventerousness this one lacks that makes it work better. <br /> <br />That's not to say there's not a share of brilliance on this, its still got a number of fine moments, check out the brilliant horn arrangements of \\"The Fat Lady of Limbourg\\" (foreshadowing much of Mick Karn's work in the mid-80s) and the relentless and swirling \\"Third Uncle\\"-- what a piece-- full of fractured guitar and driven by a throbbing bass and drum pattern, the piece is irresistable, and it sounds like post-punk years before punk. <br /> <br />The problem, however, is that while the material on the record is all quite good, little else stands out the way so many pieces on 'Jets' did, again, its not that anything is bad, it just tends not to grab you. <br /> <br />The remastered release adds much improved sound that allows the album to be better appreciated-- it could have been recorded yesterday. <br /> <br />All in all, its a good album, and certainly its the last of its kind-- Eno would be in a car accident after the recording of this and was lying in a bed, able to hear the radio but unable to be engaged by its music, leading him to his ambient concept.  For Eno's pop music though, I'd start with his debut (\\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\"), its a better piece.
055357342X|5.0|I'm so glad I took the time to reread this series! I'd totally forgotten the way that the book wraps up, but it will be fresh on my mind when A Feast of Crows hits the shelves.<br /><br />One again, I totally lost myself in the story. Martin is a very brave author, and I very much enjoy that about him. I don't want to spoil any of the plot points, so if you've read the first two, keep reading! If you haven't, you need to. This series is a must read for any fan of fantasy.
B00022M518|5.0|In the early '70s, Brian Eno was not the legendary producer, ambient pioneer, or recognized genius he is today.  Instead, he was a member of Roxy Music, slowly stealing the show from the rest of the band with his unique vision.  Eventually, management let him know he was \\"ready for a solo career\\".  The result is this record, one of the fine quirky pop albums of its era.  Eno's oddball lyrics, great hooks, and penchant for getting the best performances out of his musicians (a strength that would come into the fore when he became a producer) all help make this one of the most brilliant and startling debuts of its era. <br /> <br />Of course, what \\"Here comes the Warm Jets\\" may be justifiably most famous for is the guitar solo on \\"Baby's On Fire\\"-- a quirky, schizophrenic song with an odd drive and a bizarre vocal, when Robert Fripp's extended showcase begins, it is clear this is something different.  It is performed with total disregard for continuity, predictability, and pattern.  All cliches and vocabulary on the instrument sound to have been abandoned, yet it still somehow works perfectly.  And years after I've first heard it, I'm still amazed by it every time I hear it. <br /> <br />In total, the record is a mix between these sort of pieces (the propulsive \\"Blank Frank\\", bizarre and brilliant \\"The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch\\") and sort of off-kilter ballads (the downright lovely \\"Cindy Tells Me\\", bizarre and haunted \\"Driving Me Backwards\\"). <br /> <br />I think most importantly though, especially for an album mired in the '70s progressive rock scene, is that this music is fun, its driven, inspired and brilliant, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br />The remaster adds fantastic sound quality to the record as well, its crisp, clean, and sounds as though it had been recorded yesterday.  Highly recommended, even for those who already own the old issue of this.
B0006L16N8|5.0|they are always classic and comforting... they can never disappoint i especially love the song \\"Fix you\\" (its so sweet) and \\"speed of sound\\" (of course). i highly recommend this album
B00022LRXA|4.0|Brian Eno's \\"Before and After Science\\", his last song-based album until the about-to-be-released (June, 2005) \\"Another Day on Earth\\" is in many ways the album you would hope it would be, reflective of his past, pointing in some ways to the future, very much texture-oriented music.  On the other hand, while it has its moments, it fails to capture the immediacy of \\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" or the beauty of \\"Discreet Music\\", but its still a great listen.<br /><br />The album is really two sides, the first being more energetic, the second being a bit more ambient in feel.  On the first side, there are three things that immediately draw you in-- the first is an overt use of vocal harmonies-- Eno's vocals are almost always in a harmony form with two or three voices singing the line (\\"No One Receiving\\", melodic pop song \\"Here He Comes\\").  The second is bassist Percy Jones, whose playing on a few of the tracks, in particular \\"Kurt's Rejoinder\\", is nothing short of astonishing.  The third is the use of space-- look no further than standout \\"Energy Fools the Magician\\", where the four piece (Eno, Jones, drummer Phil Collins back when he was a drummer and guitarist Fred Frith) manipulate space as a fifth instrument to amazing effect.<br /><br />The second side is much more in line with the ambient work of Eno's most recent albums-- a overwhelming feel of haunted ambient with vocals dominates.  The entire side is full of fantastic material, from the haunted \\"Julie With...\\" to the lyrically brilliant and dark \\"Spider and I\\".<br /><br />Overall, its a rewarding album that finds an artist caught in between forms, but even in transition, his brilliance shines through.  Recommended.
0060005424|5.0|If this is possible this book is even better than Sabriel. The story is filled with interesting characters, good humor, great plot and excellent adventures. I highly recommend this book to EVERONE who wants to read a good book.
B0007GFFVQ|2.0|A collection of 18 pieces, some intended for specific films, some evidentally not, Eno's \\"Music For Films\\" is one of his most difficult ambient records.  The music contained within this disc is moody and cinematic, but its also fractured.  With most the tracks less than two minutes long, ideas often do not get the chance to develop to their fullness (\\"Aragon\\", \\"Alternative 3\\"). <br /> <br />Having stated that, there is some fanastic material on here (\\"From the Same Hill\\" with some great guitar/synth interplay, the Frippertronics piece \\"Slow Water\\", edgy and bizarre \\"Quartz\\") that makes it worth seeking out for fans of Eno.  For the more curious, try \\"Discreet Music\\", \\"Music for Airports\\", or \\"No Pussyfooting\\" (Fripp & Eno) for a better introduction.
0064471837|5.0|I think this is an excellent book and is definantly worth your time. This is such a great book that I forced my dad to read it and<br /><br />even he really enjoyed it.(thats really rare). Anyway I know that everyone will enjoy this book kids and parents alike.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've actually heard that some people are a bit disappointed with Coldplay's third album, \\"X&Y\\". For the life of me, I can't understand why. Coldplay's potent yet simple formula seems to be getting better and better with each passing album. Now, \\"A Rush\\" was unbelievable art, but once you give this album a chance, I think you'll realize that it's every bit as good in it's own right. I have just gotten this a week ago and have only listened to it a few times, but I know good music when I hear it and this is defintely \\"it\\" upon the first listen. It also appears to be just a HAIR harder than past material, if you like that sort of thing. Is it the band's best yet? I probably wouldn't go THAT far, but it is without a doubt right next to \\"A Rush\\"; same level of excellence and beauty. If you loved their previous work, this is a must-buy that will not leave you disappointed. SOME people are a little let down, but only because they are expecting the band to repeat a highly successful album, which no true artist ever does.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|It was a great night.We were there at The Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. We were warned that the band started sharp at 8.00pm. It was the third and last night of recording this DVD. About 9.15pm The Eagles took a 20 minute break. They returned to the stage and the whole set finshed after 5 encores at 12.30am. Now for US$80.00 name another band that plays for 4 hours plus - is spontaneous, exciting and just magic. What a night and what a must have DVD. Can't wait. If The Eagles are not your bag this concert was electric, on stage live they have it - don't miss this concert just for the sheer energy of this show.When The Eagles toured Oz they played sell out concerts coast to coast to national critical acclaim. Share the joy, share the excitement - these guys still have it - one and all - the performance - the lyrics, the musicianship - am I raving - you got the message!!!!
B0000508U6|4.0|Having just discovered this amazing band not long ago, I am unable to write a real in-depth review. But I do have to say that it is very moving music and I haven't been touched so much by any other band except maybe parts of Pearl Jam and a lot of Pink Floyd. Although in my opinion, this particular album isn't quite as astonishing as what's to come, but still very moving and impressive. A very mellow blend of accoustics, piano, and Chris Martin's amazing voice, Coldplay are like a sound of fresh air for the ears. This album is very listenable from start to finish, and brings all your emotions out on the table. You might recognize \\"Yellow\\", since it was played on the radio so much in '00, but it is nonetheless a terrific song as they all are. Give it a listen- you might be surprised. But be prepared- it is very mellow; if you are expecting anything hard do not waste your time with this. But if you want mellow and touching, Coldplay is a great place to visit, and this album is a great place to start.

While most people understand that aromatherapy can influence the emotions, most books I have encountered are fairly general about how they affect emotions.  Lavender, for example, is \\"calming\\"--but so is sandalwood, geranium, chamomile, and any number of other oils.  Using the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (the same theories that are the basis of acupuncture), you can target an essence more specifically for your body.  That he does all this in an easy to read book is so much the better!
B000069AUI|5.0|I was totally amazed with this album. Coldplay has managed to not only reach it's debut's magic, but has surpassed it with this unforgettable sophmore effort. I liked Coldplay's debut, \\"Parachutes\\", after a couple listens, but I fell in love with \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" right after I first heard it. I like a lot of harder stuff, but man this music really hits me. You can listen to this masterpiece from start to finish and it proves to be a very rewarding experience. It is packed with powerful emotion and might possibly bring a tear to your eye. Very heart-felt stuff; all that fuss you hear about this band is for real and well deserved. Highlights include \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\", ah heck- the WHOLE album is a HIGHLIGHT! If you liked \\"Parachutes\\", you will absolutely love this!
0812932293|5.0|I can't add much to what others have posted here in terms of content of the book, but I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in business ethics, family/personal life vs. professional life balance issues, and what it takes to run a company.  One aspect of Branson's business persona that I found interesting was his distaste for what he terms \\"emotional confrontation\\" -- which would happen when employees needed to be fired/laid off: he could never do it and always had one of his partners do it.  And Branson confirmed many of my own beliefs on work-a-day world values:    * you should be able size anyone up within 2 minutes. Trust your gut instincts.  * likewise with business transactions:  you should know with a minimal review of the circumstances whether you're being taken advantage of or not. Again, trust your gut.  * taking on debt to grow your business is fine as long as you plan an out from the worst-case scenario  * whenever possible, take a bad situation, turn it on its head and get some attention/press coverage.  Any mention of your company/brand is better than NO mention.      What really stood out for me was the last quarter of the book that details Branson and Virgin's battle with British Airways and what it took to get out from under BA's anti-competitive business tactics.    I'd love to read an updated edition where Branson gives his take on the digital music revolution going on now and its impact on the music business (though I'm not sure how involved he is in V2  Records).      Highly recommended.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|If you usually like \\"Live\\" recordings, you will really like this. And if you're like most people and love to see your favorite bands in concert, this is an awesome concert DVD that you will enjoy time and time again. Hearing Coldplay's music is ONE thing, but SEEING it is yet ANOTHER. What you see only amplifies the intense emotion you hear. Taken from their '03 tour, this set includes hits from their first two wonderful albums, and also features never-before-released \\"Moses\\" and \\"One I Love\\". All in all, this is a GREAT package for the fans, and if you love Coldplay, then this will really make you smile!
B00006879E|5.0|Finally a band to come out of the new millenium to be thankful for. This band has all the elements most bands or groups these days are lacking...talent! These guys can write great songs, sing well, play thier own instruments and are a great live band too. I only hope they are not a one album wonder, everybody should support Maroon 5 for the simple reason that music is in a poor state right now and bands like this unfortunatley are fading..keep up the good work Maroon 5.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Despite my 3 star rating (I would give it 3.5 if I had the choice), I consider myself a defender of \\"Star Trek: Insurrection.\\"  I think that this Star Trek film deserves points for trying big things, even if some of them didn't work.  Some people have accused this of being the \\"lazy milking dry of a cash cow,\\" (DVD Journal) but I see a lot of energy and love in this production.  True, there are many problems with it.  \\"Insurrection\\" doesn't fail as miserably as \\"The Final Frontier,\\" but there is something fundamentally dissatisfying about it.  Nonetheless, it is quite enjoyable, and indeed somewhat underrated. <br /> <br />\\"Insurrection\\" both tackles a big issue and tries to be relevant to the current world situation.  The film argues that hurting a native population in order to obtain a valuable natural research is never justifiable, even if that population is miniscule.  Though many may disagree with its logic that the lives of 600 people are more important than helping billions, it is still easy to see Captain Picard's (a terrific as usual Patrick Stewart) moral center and to root for him.  For making a film with this risky message, I give \\"Insurrection\\" a certain leeway that I don't give \\"Nemesis\\" (which is a standard action film).  Tackling big issues like this is what Star Trek was meant to be in the first place. <br /> <br />\\"Insurrection\\"'s primary failure is the lack of tension.  The action in here is surprisingly formulaic, especially coming off of the rousing action of \\"First Contact.\\"   Also, I think that this movie's strength is in its moral ambiguity at the beginning, so removing that renders the climax pretty flat.  Rather than Picard taking on the whole Federation, as would have been powerful, a two-dimensional villain is force fed to us instead in the form of R'uafo.  F. Murray Abraham is competent as R'uafo, but he is a pretty uninteresting character, and his inevitable end (\\"Nemesis\\" was yet to come, after all) is pathetic. <br /> <br />However, one thing I like in this movie that others don't is the comedy.  Despite its big subject matter, this is a pretty light film.  It is like \\"The Voyage Home\\" and not \\"The Final Frontier\\" in that much of the humor is actually funny.  The \\"Next Generation\\" actors here are all having fun in their roles, and are probably more energetic than they were in any other of their four films. <br /> <br />\\"Insurrection\\" has some major problems, but I think that it is overall a solid Trek entry.  Those searching for an epic were disappointed (though I would argue there hasn't been an \\"epic\\" Trek film attempted since \\"The Search for Spock\\"), but it's good to enjoy \\"Insurrection\\" as light-hearted fun with some beloved characters.  For an odd-numbered entry, this isn't all bad.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Here's what this Coldplay album is: a memorable guitar or piano riff tumbling aimlessly like driftwood in a falsetto and synthesizer soup. <br /> <br />Sure, some might have found \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" to be a slow dance into monotony, but listening to \\"X&Y\\" it becomes clear that Coldplay's sophomore record is probably going to be their career peak. A record that spawned the hit single \\"Clocks\\" among others which weren't even the best tracks on the record (\\"In My Place,\\" \\"The Scientist\\") is hard to top if you're Coldplay, for sure, but perhaps going the \\"experimental\\" route wasn't the best way to shake the naysayers... especially those who seem to think Coldplay and Radiohead sound alike. <br /> <br />The change doesn't suit them at all. \\"Experimental\\" for Coldplay seems to mean \\"we quit writing hooks whenever we got lazy, because we can get away with that these days.\\" The result is a batch of mostly directionless, shoegazer-aping humdrum -- the very antithesis, at least in my mind, of the focused, immediate songwriting displayed on \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Speed of Sound,\\" with its ethereal leading piano riff and a soaring chorus about birds, is little more than a repeat performance of \\"Clocks\\" without the impact of that song's smash success. That \\"Speed of Sound\\" would be a hit single was a foregone conclusion before it hit the airwaves, but it's pretty much the only song here that could say that. Any edge the band may have had has been worn smooth by something (time, success, the grating Gwyneth Paltrow). Chris Martin and company seem to be running on autopilot with this release and \\"X&Y\\" overall strikes me as the result of taking the first two Coldplay albums and putting them in a blender: finely pureed mush. <br /> <br />Some would be hard pressed to tell the difference between any of the three, but discrimination of such caliber generally requires actually listening to all three, which is clearly beyond the scope of some people's ambitions. <br /> <br />This is not to say that there isn't a moment or three on this record that have some merit, but it never begins to scrape the bottom of the stratospheric-by-comparison album which preceded it. There's nothing as high-flying as \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" or \\"Politik,\\" nothing as perfectly simple and succinct like \\"Green Eyes,\\" and nothing as beautifully somber as \\"Amsterdam\\" on \\"X&Y.\\" <br /> <br />I think history will favor \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" but \\"X&Y\\" is probably perfectly fine for many, many people. In any case, this band is in no way as terrible as so many make them out to be, nor are they as brilliant as some give them credit for. <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you liked them before, approach with caution. If you didn't like them before, do I really have to tell you that you aren't going to like it?
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Watched the concert on NBC and was enthralled, as were my  <br />70-something parents (country music fans since childhood). Not only did Mom remember almost every song from my teen years and beyond, sang along happily, (I LOVED the Eagles then and now, and got teary, goose bumpy and completely enjoyed every moment), but she cried and applauded. <br />A comment from Dad, \\"This is REAL music. The musicians are extremely talented, the music is beautiful, has depth and is skillfully arranged, the lyrics actually SAY something--and I can understand the words. I'd heard alot of these songs over the years, but had no idea they were Eagles' songs.\\"  <br />Of course the young fans can't remember the Eagles, they were NEW fans, which I think speaks fo itself.  Longevity, an enormous and diverse fan base, the tounge-in-cheek \\"Farewell Tour 1\\", it was all masterfully done and fantastic. They aren't just older, they're wiser (commentary from band members and new song lyrics like \\"One Day at a Time\\" make that clear) and better than ever. <br />Loved it, loved it, loved it... <br />A Fan for Life
0783225482|4.0|Two women, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn have known each other for ages. Throughout their relationship, Meryl, the actress, has always had the upper hand and delighted in taking things from Goldie. This includes her fianc, the plastic surgeon. As time goes by, Both women age and become despondent over the ravages of aging on their bodies. Each is willing to give up anything to regain and then maintain youth. <br /> <br />They get their wish. <br /> <br />They stumble onto a lady with a magic formula.

They are going to be with their bodies a long time so it is important to maintain them.

B000W796OM|3.0|First, why is it I can't find the double discs for any of these on Amazon? That's got me bugged. Now onto the review. I've heard all the books, and LOVED the book version of this.<br /><br />But I won't lie, this is a really horrible adaption to the book. It's a much longer book than the previous two, but a shorter film than the previous two. So much is CUT out that even for a movie, its ridiculous. Even important details!<br /><br />Like how it was Lupin, James, Sirius and Peter who created the Map. And like 5 other Crookshanks/Scabbers scenes were cut out. The argument between Ron and Hermione in this film over Crookshanks 'killing' Scabbers was so WEAK, and rushed compared to the book.<br /><br />The actual scene is in fact, not even in the film. It's in a deleted scene. It's poorly acted thanks to the horrible directing by the new director. In the book, it was a much BIGGER deal. But it was poorly portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />Another problem I have is there's TOO much humor in it! HP is not a comedy, its a Fantasy/Action/Adventure/Drama and some romance towards the end of the series. Sure there's humor, but this movie went overkill with it.<br /><br />Annoying random burping sounds from Buckbeak for example. Cheap humor, not even funny. I'm so glad they got rid of this director, he was the WORST! Worst director ever! The only reason I give this three stars is because the CG was really amazing. Buckbeak and Lupin werewolf looked great.<br /><br />And the colorful tone was nice. Plus disc two has COOL special features. You can tour Honeydukes, Lupin's office, play games and watch<br />interviews. Although not near as many deleted scenes. Only FIVE! How pitiful is that?<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban is a good movie on its own, but when you compare to the book, it's awful. Makes the readers want to cry. New characters introduced includes Lupin, Trelawney, Crookshanks, Sirius, and Peter.
B000001EL3|3.0|\\"Destroyer\\" is one of the quintessential KISS albums. It definitely marked a new direction for the guys and took them to stardom. <br /> <br />\\"King Of The Night Time World\\" is a great Stanley croon, with the AWESOME \\"God Of Thunder\\" following.  The last three tracks (on the regular version) really kick it out - \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" will make you sing the lyrics regardless of where you are.  \\"Beth\\" still is very charming and works in 2005, with \\"Do You Love Me\\" really closing out the solid record.   <br /> <br />This is a great party or cleaing the apartment record with anthems and interludes in between.  Pick it up.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I guess if you can detach yourself from all the hype & critics, you might be able to come to a conclusion about this one. And  chances are  X&Y won't change anyone's opinion about coldplay. Those that love coldplay, will see the good, those that hate them will see the bad.    The hype    Will wrongfully proclaim Coldplay as the best thing since U2. There is a community out there who will laugh at this very premises, laugh at the idea that coldplay has re-invented the wheel, or that X&Y should even make it onto the top 5 albums of 2005. I am one of those people.    Will rightfully acknowledge Coldplay's solid career, and respectful journey thus far.   It's easy to become cynical of their worldwide success, but in truth, Chris Martin has a gift in capturing catchy melodies and inducing a raw sincerity.     The critics     Will rightfully criticize X&Y for its generic song structure. There is a standard blue print to most of their songs. The wails of ooooooohs and aaaaaaahs that fill much of their chorus lines, is amateurish, tiresome and overdone. They need to step away from this flawed formula. By the third album, things are starting to sound slightly generic.     Will wrongfully insist that coldplay needs to re-invents the wheel. There seems to be a community most of which whom belong to the Radiohead era, believe that a successful formula is one that is forever changing. I disagree.  Maybe if `Hail to the thief' was a little more successful, they would have less time flexing their muscles at everyone else.  Coldplay has incorporated enough changes to sound refreshing without losing their identity.     In the end, X&Y is a well placed third album. If anyone expected X&Y to lift coldplay to new dimension overestimated their technical abilities to begin with. I think much of the confusion stems from a sole track named, `clocks' that mistakenly ascended ROBTTH to a new level. In truth `Clocks' was an anomaly for coldplay, a fast paced piano piece that was inspired during their tour with the band MUSE. (If you wanted `clocks' turn to the technically gifted Muse and their album `Origin of Symmetry'. You wont regret it).  If we ignore that track, everything else is in its right place. You will continue to hate or love coldplay.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Although the obvious choice would have been to cast him as Paris, Brad Pitt turns in a credible performance as Achilles in this would-be epic that strays far wide of the mark. Remarkably, the movie opens well, with a reasonable setup of context and characterization before linking into the plot line of The Iliad (not surprisingly, en media res, the element present in Homer's work and which Aristotle thought necessary to all epics is missing here.) Once Hector is dead, however, all bets are off. Apparently, modern Hollywood epics can extend to three hours--beyond that, cut to the chase. All pretext of following the model of the Iliad is cast aside as the the film rushes through the perfunctory destruction of Troy/deaths of Priam and Achilles. Eric Bana's performance is incredibly wooden (for context think Keanu Reeves in a would-be epic setting,) even the tragic consequences for prince Hector's family and ancestral city cannot alleviate the rigor mortis with which Bana plods through the role. Though O'Toole, as always, is wonderful, the portrayal of Paris and Helen's relationship is typical one-dimensional Hollywood schlock. While I enjoyed Sean Bean's convincing Odysseus, I will stop far short of recommending that Petersen take a shot at the Odyssey.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Being the type of person that insists on closure in my life, and constantly seeks understanding of anything I encounter, this movie made me a basket case.  I couldn't wait to get on Amazon and make sure that I didn't miss the profound?, funny?, thought provoking?, statement that David Lynch was making.  As far as a review goes- it was one of the few times in my life I enjoyed being totally and utterly confused.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I've been a fan of QotSA for a few years now.  They're a very good band that I feel have never gotten the respect they fully deserve.  However, I will tell you right now that this album isn't that great.  It's not bad, but it's just not nearly as good as their previous albums.  It has it's moments, but previous albums have had so much more.  If you're really looking to get into this band I suggest that you check out their older releases (Beaver EP and self-titled LP), for I feel QotSA were at their best during this time.  Rated-R is also a good album, but Songs for the Deaf (3rd album) is even better.  So basically it comes down to this:  albums 1 and 3 are amazing; 2nd album is very good; 4th album is simply mediocre in comparison.
B00008NRL8|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums of the last 3 or so years. Totally rules!!! I still listen to it today as it still sounds fresh. If you haven't heard it go out and buy it and don't waste any time because it's excellent!! The band perfectly fuses old Argentine tango with modern electronica (downtempo and chilout) to perfection. There have been countless imitations to their music and even an Astor Piazzolla remix CD but this is the original and it's top notch! The others are good too but Gotan Project are the innovators in this style of music! Every single track is perfection with Epoca being my favorite! Their music has also been licensed to many compilations such as the Buddha Bar series or other similar type of lifestyle compilations cd's.  <br /> <br />SJ <br />[...]

B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Having just viewed STAR TREK: INSURRECTION for the first time since it's initial theatrical release, I will say that the  passage of time has been rather kind.  Though I found it to be an extremely disappointing entry in the franchise the first time around, my revisit to the third NEXT GENERATION offering has yielded better results.   <br /> <br />Taking a more light hearted approach than before, screenwriter Michael Pillar provides genuine laughs with his story as the crew attempts to prevent a race of people called the Ba'ku from being wrongfully removed from a planet of eternal youth by their enemy race, the Son`a.  The Federation's involvement in these nefarious plans draws quite obvious parallels to the historic wrongs done to the  Indians here in America over the last two centuries.  Jonathan Frakes again takes the directorial reigns and seems to really be enjoying himself, along with the entire cast.  Not all of the humor works, however, as we are occasionally subjected to embarrassing moments such as  the infamous \\"breast\\" conversation between Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi, Worf's pimple, Data's \\"lock and load\\" moment, and a few other not-too-funny moments.   Overall, the humor does work and is balanced well with the stories more action oriented sequences. <br /> <br />The story this time around is bit slow moving, but it offers up plenty of wonderful character moments for the cast along the way.  Geordi getting his sight back and watching his first sunrise as we would see it was very touching, reminding me of how good LeVar Burton is when the writers bother to utilize his talents.  Picard is finally given a romance again, after what seems to be an eternity of their having forgotten the Captain`s romantic side.  In regards to the characters, the movie excels, though the plot itself is founded on rather shaky ground at times.  As the story moves along, we are presented with an alien race obsessed with cosmetic surgery as the primary villains.  This is laughable at best and makes it hard to take their threat seriously.  I cannot help but think this was added as an excuse to use more silly latex facial appliances on the actors.  Also, the story is bogged down by silly plot twists towards the end, such as the ingenious last minute use of the holo-deck ship.  The space battles were not well written, resorting to silly ideas like ejecting warp cores to counter the effects of some kind of unexplained new weapon, as well as steering a huge starship via Nintendo joystick.  For every scene that made me enjoy this movie, there was another one that left me scratching my head in frustration.  Not helping matters was the not-so-special digital effects themselves, to which I can only ask the question, \\"Where was Industrial Light & Magic when we needed them?\\"   <br /> <br />We are treated to three new guest stars in this adventure.  Donna Murphy plays Picard's Ba'ku love interest, Anij, who shares some wonderful on screen chemistry with Patrick Stewart.  F. Murray Abraham plays the leader of the Son'a called Ru'afo.  Impatience is the key word here, and Abraham is never really given anything to work with that would humanize his character too much outside of typically bland villainous  motivations.  He does his best (while hidden away underneath ludicrous makeup), but not enough material was given to Abraham to allow him to become anything more than a generic antagonist.  Anthony Zerbe plays Vice-Admiral Dougherty of Starfleet.  He is actually quite good here, playing a man who genuinely wants to share the prospects of eternal youth with the galaxy, but through his dealings has lost his own ability to see the  immediate wrongs about to be perpetrated.  Zerbe brings to surface the aspects of a character that shows his regret at the direction things are going, but is powerless to truly stop it at this point. <br /> <br />This two disc special edition treatment Paramount has given us is another winner, I must say.  We are given the now expected text commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda which is always interesting, but curiously enough there is no audio commentary accompanying this outing.  Rounding out the first disc is a wonderful DTS soundtrack for the film that adds a great deal to the viewing experience. <br /> <br />The main attraction on Disc 2 is of course the deleted scenes, which oddly enough are not listed anywhere on the DVD packaging.  Seven scenes are offered up for this film, including the alternate ending.  A few of the extra scenes are preceded by comments from co-producer Peter Lauritson as he explains why the scene was deleted.  There are two scenes of note here:  \\"The Kiss\\" features Picard and Anij sharing a passionate kiss as time slows down around them, depicting one of those special moments in one's life spoken of earlier in the film.  \\"Alternate Ending\\" depicts villainous Ru'afo as he is stranded aboard the Injector pod.  After choosing to remain in the projectile rather than admit his failure, the pod is launched  into the rejuvenating rings of the planet with the Son'a leader aboard, causing him to become younger and younger.  It is explained that studio executives thought this ending was weak, but I feel that it would have suited the story quite well and actually fit the ideals of Star Trek much better than the more generic explosive ending we were given.  <br /> <br />There are many interviews and mini-documentaries that give an informative look behind the scenes of the film, but \\"The Story\\" stood out as the best.  In it, Michael Pillar provides lots of insight as to what inspired the story, as well as how and why differing elements were altered along the way.  Plenty of effects interviews, storyboards, trailers, and photo galleries abound, as well as two interesting retrospectives; one featuring the career of make-up artist Michael Westmore and the other devoted to the women of Star Trek. <br /> <br />Overall, this is yet another worthy entry in Paramount's line ofSTAR TREK Special Edition DVD releases.
B0002S947K|5.0|I buy close to a hundred CD's a year, and haven't felt compelled to submit a review for any of them until now... The first time I listened to this was on my way to work, and when I got there I had to pretend I was having an allergy attack so everyone wouldn't know I had been crying my eyes out!! Ray LaMontagne's songs are beautiful, haunting, simple but so soulful. His voice sounds like it is from another era, and his lyrics are full of emotion and truth. Clearly one of the best post-break-up albums of all time, but worth getting no matter what. Ray will stay with you.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This is one of the best Shakira albums ever. This is a voyage to new sounds and styles. I think this record is better than her last in spanish \\"Donde estan los ladrones\\". The collaboration with Cerati makes an impressive distinction on tracks like \\"Un da especial\\" and \\"No\\" where Shakira's voice sounds tremendously fine. This album has also powerful ballads like \\"tus pupilas\\" and all the lyrics are thoughtful. <br />Buy this album, you wont't regret it!
B0007OCG56|3.0|This is a sweet film, not exactly realistic; everyone seems to be a little too much on type.  Now I did not say everyone was stereotyped, just actors playing a type.  Cloris Leachman is the drunken mother ignored by her striving, seemingly perfect daughter, Tea Leoni.  Adam Sandler plays, er Adam Sandler, a successful, quirky, restrained Jewish guy.  Paz Vega is smart, wise, Mexican, immigrant, and poor housekeeper to Sandler's two kids and cloying, controlling wife.  Flour has a daughter out of wedlock (How did that happen to such a wise woman?)and then takes the unhappy rich family under her wings as much as the language barrier will bear.  That is it.  Sandler is unhappy with narcissistic Leoni and well he should be.  He pouts and grovels.  Gradually he comes to appreciate Vega as the counterpoint to his neurotic wife.    I commend Sandler's attempt to move on from his dopey caricature, his screwball, gross-out roles.  I am thinking of the underrated, Punch Drunk Love, when I say he's going adult in comedy or drama situations.  Keep trying Adam.  Someday you will be real.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been a fan of Coldplay since I first heard Yellow on the radio and thought that maybe Dave Matthews had a hit again... then someone said it's not Dave Matthews, but this new british group called Coldplay. I was intrigued. Then came \\"Clocks,\\" whose opening piano chords still make me smile every time I hear it. Coldplay's Live 2003 CD quickly became my favorite live CD ever. And finally, Last Tuesday, X&Y, Coldplay's 3rd studio album, was released.  <br /> <br />X&Y is great. \\"Speed of Sound,\\" while currently the first and only single off the disc, will surely not be the last. The disc opens with the powerful and melodic, \\"Square One,\\" which judging by sound alone, will probably be the next single released. Another hit-bound track is \\"White Shadows,\\" an upbeat ballad about breaking free of a life of mundane conformity. There are going to be a lot of fan favorites off this disc. <br /> <br />The disc's highlight is \\"Fix You.\\" Reminiscent of debut \\"Parachutes\\" closing tune \\"Everything's Not Lost,\\" this track is a bittersweet treat. It begins quiet and somber, but midway through the song Jonhhy Buckland's high-pithced guitar picks up the pace and rises to an uplifting coda. This one is guaranteed to be one of those rock-show anthems that will undoubtedly ignite 20,000 cigarette lighters (or cell phone displays) when Coldplay start their tour later this summer. <br /> <br />Will Coldplay be the next U2? Difficult to tell. But the similarities are obvious if you just listen, whether it's the simple lyrics belted out by Bono or Martin, or Buckland and The Edge's signature guitar sounds. But regardless of whom you compare this group to, this is a quartet that's not going anywhere but up for a long time coming.
0812968255|5.0|Written nearly 2,000 years ago, Marcus Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" seem to become increasingly popular in eras of obscene greed, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the one we are suffering through right now. It is at such times that thoughtful people reach out for rational guides to living.<br /><br />To some extent, the Meditations provide that kind of guidance, but the reader looking for a comprehensive plan for living well is likely to be disappointed. Instead of an organized body of thought. the \\"Meditations\\" are simply haphazard thoughts that Marcus wrote down over the years as aids in developing his personal ethics. This does not mean that they are useless, simply that they are disorganized and repetitive.<br /><br />To the Stoics, everything is part of the natural order, including cruelty, pain and death. The function of the individual within this world is to suffer with dignity, restraining anger and being tolerant of the acts of others, recognizing that anything they do is in their nature and the natural order of things. The Stoic philosophy is basically pessimistic - Life's a losing battle, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter because we only spend a brief time here, before being recycled by nature. The human body is no more that \\"rotting meat in a bag.\\" (8.38)<br /><br />A pessimistic view, certainly, yet taken as a whole, the Meditations provide useful information for dealing with life's unpleasantries, most of which involve living the simple life - being modest and grateful for the good things that one has enjoyed, treating others politely and fairly, being indifferent to superficial honors and indicia of status, and living life honorably, simply and well during our brief moment on the stage. And if things aren't going well? We'll be dead soon enough, and after that it won't matter.<br /><br />The foregoing sounds simplistic and depressing, yet the effect of the book is positive, perhaps because we all recognize that we are capable of being better people and Marcus gives us very specific advice on how to do it. A self-help book in the finest sense.<br /><br />Gregory Hays' translation is quite readable, although perhaps too modern for some readers. His introduction is excellent, proving a clear and comprehensive introduction to Marcus, Stoicism and their historical context.<br /><br />Readers who wish to pursue Stoicism further should consider:<br />* Arrian's abridgement of Epictetus' \\"Encheiridion;\\"<br />* Seneca's \\"Letters to Lucilius;\\" and<br />* Cicero's \\"On the Good Life.\\"s gives us very specific advice on how to do it.

B00000273P|5.0|Great Beauty. Mastery. Breadth. Depth. Integral Balance. Humour. A dark streak. On and On and On.     And it came from that golden time: when alternative music was truly alternative and not a commercial peg; when the legacies of psychedelia, the singer-songwriter tradition -- and just about anything else you can imagine, had the opportunity to allign itself in the practiced, collective geniueses of  McAloon and Dolby; there must have been hell to pay.     The album may prove to be hermetic though; its references may resonate for relatively few lucky people. Count yourself lucky.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I am an enormous Volta fan, but I would say that I tend to prefer the compact power of Deloused over the more spacious and electic Francis. Francis is very, very good album, while I think Deloused is a truly GREAT album. <br /> <br />One caveat on this, however: See them live. I recently saw the Volta live (for the second time) and I can say that in concert the Francis material was absolutely stunning and mind-blowing--every bit as good as the Deloused material. Even though they are perhaps the heaviest, most convincing live sound I've ever heard, I was still caught off guard at how good the Francis material was. Perhaps a bit of the material's intensity  got lost in album production (Rick Rubin produced Deloused but not Francis and my sense is that he reigned them in and fattened up the sound a bit). Whatever the case, after hearing the songs live Francis has a whole new power!

B0009A1AS2|3.0|Dream Theater's most recent release, \\"Octavarium\\", was a disappointment to me. After great albums such as \\"Awake\\", \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" and \\"Train of Thought\\", I was expecting more of this album. The song writing is duller and overall far from Dream Theater as I know them. This album is less heavy too, with a more modern prog feel to it, but it doesn't make it any better because of that. Of course there are some good songs here. The epic title track for example is highly enjoyable, but tracks such as \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" are both far from my musical taste as it gets. The rest is good, but overall not nearly as great as earlier stuff.<br />I wish Dream Theater better luck with their next release, and hope they return to they \\"Awake\\" era sound (which will sadly most likely not happen, but we are allowed to hope, aren't we?)<br /><br />If you like Dream Theater, give this one a try, you might either love it or hate it. As for me, I'm stuck in between. Overall a good album, but nothing really special, it might grow on me even more though, I guess I just have to wait and see...
0790729407|4.0|The film was enjoyable. However, it failed to point out in <br />its material anywhere due to its propagandist tone .. <br /> <br />1. The Home Rule Bill was already passed in 1912 which was <br />suspended due to the calamatous great war. So effectively <br />Collins' actions were pointless as Ireland would have had <br />home government without the 80 subsequent years of Bloodshed <br />caused by the stream of propaganda aimed at self justification. <br /> <br />2. Collins only returned to Ireland as he was due to be <br />conscripted having been living in London for 12 years. It <br />was alleged that he could have gone to live with his brother <br />in Chicago .. could he have afforded the ticket to go ? <br /> <br />3. Ireland was NOT a colony but part of the UK so effectively <br />the implications of Irish \\"separation\\" from Britain were <br />wide ranging. There have been similar nationalist movements <br />since from Wales, Scotland etc. <br /> <br />4. The film \\"implied\\" there was conscription in Ireland <br />- there wasnt at any point. <br /> <br />5. The film \\"implied\\" there wasnt a democratic process -  <br />there was. <br /> <br />6. It failed to point out that the guns supplied to the <br />pro-crown loyalists and similarly the nationalists came <br />from the Kaiser in an attempt to keep Britian out of the <br />First World war. So the current situation in Ireland <br />was not forced by the IRA but more as a consequence of a tired <br />nation just wanting to settle a thorn in its side. Ireland <br />wasnt being oppressed in any way. <br /> <br />7. Ireland was part of Britain (see note 3.) and is still <br />represented on the Union Flag. <br /> <br />8. It failed to point out that the incident in the <br />gaelic football match was a direct knee jerk response to <br />the murder of the \\"alleged\\" Cairo gang who it was never  <br />proved were anything other army officers. <br /> <br />9. Sinn Fein never won the 1918 elections. They were ballot <br/>box rigged and the opposition were intimidated into not <br />standing against them by murder and so forth. Only Sinn Feins <br />bully boys had guns. <br /> <br />10. It failed to point out COMPLETELY the unionist perspective. <br /> <br />11. The main issue in the insurgents being executed was <br />that they themselves agreed to being treated more harshly  <br />on the grounds that their men be given clemency. <br /> <br />12. The executions of 14 leaders of the 1916 rising were <br />fair and square. Their actions as traitors to their government <br />could have seriously damaged morale in the coming battle <br />of the Somme and they were most likely executed for that <br />reason alone, not out of spite as it seemed to imply. <br /> <br />13. It also failed to point out that the 11 million dollars <br />raised in the united states by DeValera to arm and pay these  <br />men salary during the unfolding events. <br /> <br />14. No mention whatsoever of the Irish Nationalist party <br />and the fact that Irish MP's were several times over  <br />represented in Westminster. <br /> <br />Good film .. but extremely one sided. Written from the <br />Nationalist perspective. <br />
B00000JLWW|1.0|If you stuck this movie on one television and then right beside it you had another television playing 'Pearl Harbor', I would immediately commit suicide.<br /><br />'Titanic' is complete melodramatic dreck that the makers should be ashamed for making, the actors should be ashamed for performing in, and the completely braindead movie-going public should be lynched for making this film the number one all-time box office grosser(its ahead of freakin 'Star Wars' for godsakes).  Ugh.  It makes me ill just thinking about it.<br /><br />Why would anyone even care what happens in this movie?  Its got a lame cast, a lame story, and you pretty much know how its going to end.  And don't even get me going the extreme lameness of the soundtrack...ugh, Celine Dion.  I'm glad that that skag made so much money off of such a horrible song.  I hope every person who bought that album or this movie gets ebola.

The opening single is catchy and well over produced and sounds like a hidden track that should be found on \\"How to Dismatle an Atomic Bomb\\". I hoped for a bit too much. I think it is simple... Coldplay follows in music... They are a talented Pearl Jam living in the shadow of their own Nirvana... Radiohead.
0765348780|5.0|Steven Erikson is the latest epic fantasy writer to hit the united states. His first insallment to hit the market here is Gardens of a Fallen Moon. It takes place on the continent of Genabackis where the Malazan Empire is in the process of conquering the whole continet. The novell is filled characters that are fully realized and go through major changes throughout the book. The plot is also full of unexpected twists and turns that leave you stunned. There is also a grat amount of history to the land called Genabackis, Erikson gives you many tidbits throughout the book to keep you up with whats going on but they don't leave you wanting to put the book down they make it that much better. If you haven't read this book yet you need to now.    He already has the first five installments of his malazan book of the fallen out in England now, as well as two novellets related to his epic story. I have bought all of his books from England and i am going crazy waiting for the next insallment to come out. Erikson's style is his own. His fantasy world is a work worth prising on its own without the story to make it better. His fantasy world has a scope that no one has attempted at yet. So far his world spreads over three continents and has a multitude of cultures, religions and races. Not to mention the layers layers of history that are imbedded into each and every continent he has written about. His world is also full of magic, but the magic in his world is totally different than in any other book out there. Erikson's work also has greater depth to them. There are many statements in his work about society in its greatness and at its worst. Erikson gets more meaning into one chapter than  Jordan was able to put into one book.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album gets better everytime I hear it! James LaBrie never sounded better. Congrat to DT for a great new release!!!
B000002KDO|5.0|What I always liked most about Sabbath w/Ozzy was their 'plodding' heavy metal.. Not real fast, but with an powerful bass and percussion foundation (not to mention the Iommi's fuzzy riffs)...<br /><br />Of all of the 'classic' Sabbath albums, this is the one that sounds the most like they walked into a studio, plugged in their instruments and said 'ok let's jam'...<br /><br />Ironically, 'Sweat Leaf' one of the most popular tracks on the album is one of the poorest.  Yeah the lyrics are neat but I have always been thankful that it is the first track as it gets it out of the way.<br /><br />After Forever is just amazing, as is Into the Void, but for pure adrenalin nothing compares to Children of the Grave.  This is Bill Ward's 'Moby Dick' for you Zepplin freaks out there.<br /><br />As for the 'mello' songs, I have always felt that Sabbath had a unique way of putting them where they belonged on an album. Even 'Fluff' off of the SBS album was placed exactly were it needed to be.  You almost get the feeling of a live concert, with Ozzy taking a break to get a drink of.... water.. yeah that's it.. water... before coming back out to do his leap frog imitation..<br /><br />And yes it's a short album compared to those being released.  I have always felt cheated that CD's weren't around when bands like Sabbath, Aerosmith, Maiden, Scorps and Priest where in their hey days.. One can only imagine the 'garbage' that had to be left on the editing floor...

If you have ever known people like the Faultys, you will identify with it and realize that Cleese is finding humor in the things he endured as a child.
0743454529|3.0|I liked this book quite a bit - I enjoy the way Ms. Picoult writes from each character's perspective. It adds dimensions that would be lost if the story were from one point-of-view. The book raises many ethical and moral dilemmas, all of which are fascinating.<br /><br />There were people in my book club who hated this book because of the ending - I don't feel that way. I thought the ending was startling and from way out in left field, but I appreciate a writer who is able to do that. And any story that generates this much love/hate is worth reading.<br /><br />I just wish Ms. Picoult wouldn't end each and every chapter with a cliche. It absolutely drives me batty -- it's like the last sentence of every chapter and section is the title of a self-help book! I'm sorry for nitpicking - but I've read more than one of her books and they were like that too. She's quite talented and doesn't need to resort to trite phrases.
0465043550|3.0|What celebrated mathematician (inventor of fractal geometry and the famous Mandelbrot Sets) Benoit Mandelbrot discovered when analyzing market behavior is that the markets tend to go to extremes.  Instead of deviating from an average in a well-mannered linear way (as one might see in a Gaussian bell-shaped distribution) prices tend to rocket up and down according to a power law.  In other words the variance in price movements is greater than economists realized, which means that the chance of ruin for any investor is significantly higher than was generally believed.<br /><br />Furthermore, Mandelbrot discovered that market price distributions have a fractal quality to them in the sense that a chart of price movements on an hourly basis looks pretty much the same as a chart of price movements on a daily or a monthly or even a yearly basis.  Additionally, the charts of commodity prices, for example, will look the same as those of currency exchanges or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Just as a coast line has a ragged edge when viewed from the perspective of someone looking at a map, and a very similar ragged edge when viewed from an airplane, as well as seen on foot, down to the smallest of crags and crannies, so too do stock market prices.<br /><br />This is an interesting discovery, but, as Mandelbrot warns in an abstract \\"to the scientific reader,\\" it is one that \\"will NOT bring personal wealth.\\" (My emphasis.)<br /><br />Well, what a disappointment.  But not a surprise.  What this knowledge does do, Mandelbrot hopes, is to better inform investors of the underrated risks of investment and the greater chance of financial ruin should the downside \\"fat tail\\" of the fractal curve come to pass.<br /><br />I have no doubt that Mandelbrot knows what he is talking about; however I wonder if the significance of his discovery is as important as he thinks it is.  Perhaps the academics underrated risk, and maybe the same is true of many investors, but I suspect the practical players knew and know the truth.  One doesn't have to look further back than October 19, 1987 to see a one-day drop in the stock market of truly gargantuan proportions, a drop so great that the probability of it actually happening was, as Mandelbrot observes, near the edge of the impossible.<br /><br />Yes, markets do go to extremes.  Bubbles develop and burst and individual stocks have market values totally out of line with their assets, revenue and profits.  One had only to live through the go-go high tech market of the 1990s to know that.  Mandelbrot claims that part of this inexplicably erratic behavior is due to the markets having a memory of sorts.  He calls it \\"dependence,\\" an hitherto underappreciated quality.  The standard model of market behavior insisted that today's price movement is an independent event.  At least that is Mandelbrot's assertion.  Personally, I think most experienced traders know that today's price is affected by price movements in the past if only because traders themselves have memories.  But more than that market prices seem influenced by the past because some of the same mechanisms, phenomena and conditions still prevail.<br /><br />For example, on pages 184-185 Mandelbrot recalls that in 1982 IBM hired then small Intel to make its microprocessors and a company headed by the unknown Bill Gates to provide its software.  He then observes \\"the fates of these three companies are still intertwined.\\"  He calls this \\"long dependence\\" and \\"a pillar of fractal geometry.\\"  However most investors would merely note that IBM, Intel, and Microsoft are in similar businesses whose stock prices rise and fall more or less together because of that.  If IBM had started up a pretzel factory in 1982 would their stock prices be correlated?  Mandelbrot seems to imply that they would; but I think it may be that he is so enamored of the magic of his fractals that he sees what he wants to see.<br /><br />But maybe he is right.  Maybe there is some ghost of influence in the past that would to some extent intertwine the market movements of the pretzel company started by IBM with that of IBM itself.  If so, I would like to know the mechanism at work.  Mandelbrot allows that he doesn't know what that might be.  Again I think it is in the memory of the traders.  Mandelbrot acknowledges as much on pages 185-186 when he mentions the old traders who had experienced the crash of 1929 and were therefore more cautious than they might have been without such a memory.<br /><br />And this is really the bottom line about market behavior: the extremes to which markets go is largely the direct result of the extremes to which the minds (and hearts and souls) of the traders go.  Human emotion is why some high tech stocks had greater market caps than Dow Jones blue chip companies even though the upstarts had no earnings.  Human emotion is why tulip bulbs were once worth more than gold.  And human emotion is why markets crash so suddenly, seemingly without rhyme or reason.  And human emotion is why the distribution curves of market prices have fat tails, Mandelbrot's fractal discoveries notwithstanding.<br /><br />Bottom line: interesting and well written (co-author and professional journalist Richard L. Hudson had a lot to do with that, I suspect) but of dubious utility for the practical investor.me ghost of influence in the past that would to some extent intertwine the market movements of the pretzel company started by IBM with that of IBM itself.

B0007Y08PQ|3.0|Though this would have made a fine entry as an expanded TV ep, as a movie it feels somewhat flat (and puzzlingly so).  Sound and visuals on the DVD are crisp and detailed.  Oddly enough, there is a fight scene on the 'behind the scenes' disc involving Data in combat with the Ba'ku that was deleted - odd, because it's actually fairly good and would have probably improved the film on the whole.  Definitely not a bad film just underwhelming.  Also nice to see that F. Murray Abraham is still working since Amadeus and Last Action Hero.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can feel the tears rolling down my cheeks as I write this review. This album is probably the best pop record to be released in the last 50 years. She has such a powerful persona. Her trials and tribulations in life far exceed ours. She grew up in the ghetto, and ate noodles for 5 years of her life. I'm glad she made it to the big time now. Forget Britney and N'Sync, Christina's the real mickey mouse girl.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Three stories - three tales of anime from Katsuhiro Otomo - really hit the spot.  Each individual story could make for a good DVD but together they make a great DVD.  The first, Magnetic Rose, is a sci-fi horror story which feels like a episode from the TV anime series Planetes (which is now out on DVD).  The second is more humor than horror, about a poor guy who ends up getting into the middle of a mess, when he accidentally takes the wrong pill and becomes a dangerous weapon - one that has to be stopped at all cost!  The last tale, named Cannon Fodder, seems to be dark, somewhat depressing, 1984ish story about a city which does nothing but fire giant guns at an unseen enemy.  Everything is linked to the guns, from school classes to the weather reports.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|Sure it isn't as spectacular as the DVD's now, we've been spoiled with all the crap they put on things now.  And I don't know how people can complain about the plot lines and such and call themselves MacGyver fans.  The plots are exactly how they were in the 80s and that should not reflect on the rating for the DVD.  I was 2 when MacGyver first aired, and I have been a loyal watcher to this day.  Still a fan of all the people in the show too, many of whom have gone on to do great things.  Yes, it would be better with extras, or chapter menus but it is still MacGyver and I will take the show however I can get it.  This show was the best ever.  Still the only character I know that EVERYONE knows no matter what their tastes or age.  :)
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I've been a fan since I discovered DT by accident when ordering from Columbia House in 1993 & had one album left to go.  I came across Images and Words, thought it was a cool name for a band, and since it was (sort of) free, figured why not try them out?  Needless to say, I've been enthralled by their music ever since and would certainly consider them my favorite band that currently releases new music.  Rather than get into a chronology of what I've liked most over the years from DT and then comparing this album to others, I'll keep it simple.  I've enjoyed all of their albums, sure some more than others, but overall they're all awfully easy to pop into the CD player.  TOT was fascinating since it felt like they just let loose more than before and focused on kicking a$$ first versus flexing their technical prowess like other albums, and I love it.  If you want that same heft to your music, get LaBrie's solo album, which is spectacular in that vein.  I bought Octavarium and Elements on the same day, so it's been an interesting audio comparison.  But, back to Octavarium - this is a terrific album, not as complex musically as others, softer than some in places, but since DT is a progressive band, things should change every time, shouldn't they?  Very cool album from a very cool, very prolific band.  It's good to be a fan.  For those of you who want to hear the same stuff from your band over and over, I recommend AC/DC and Kiss.  Fun to listen to, but do they ever stretch you?
B0000VCZKW|4.0|Mathilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is an extremely curious and intelligent young girl who is very different from her low-brow, mainstream parents (Danny DeVito and real-life wife Rhea Perlman), who quite cruelly ignore her. As she grows older, she begins to discover that she has telekinetic powers. Not until a teacher shows her kindness for the first time does she realize that she can use those powers to do something about her sufferings and help her friends as well. Villains from the awful Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), headmistress of her miserable school Crunchem Hall, to her parents and older brother begin to feel her ire. Look for Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) in a small part as an FBI agent investigating Mathilda's shady father. <br /> <br />The mordant vision of author Roald Dahl's world probably appealed to the director of War of the Roses and Hoffa, for it permeates this witty, eccentric, dark-toned children's film for adults. Matilda (Mara Wilson), an unusually bright 8-year-old whose reading fare runs to Moby Dick and For Whom the Bell Tolls, is saddled with a pair of comically selfish and obtuse parents (Danny De Vito and Rhea Perlman) whom she has to persuade to allow her to go to school. But her principil, the child-hating Miss Trunchbull Pam Ferris, proves no more enlightened than her parents. This hilariously exaggerated, Lewis Carroll-like version of the world is probably not too far from what many children may feel on a bad day. De Vito and Perlman camp it up outrageously and Ferris gives a terrific performance as a cartoonish villain. Cinematographer Stefan Czapsky shoots from a number of strange angles, making this perhaps the first expressionist film for children. <br /> <br />This DVD  of course has just  the  awful  fullscreen version  and, there is so much  picture information missing from  the sides. This was shot in the ratio  of 2:35 so,  we are not seeing all that  we should be. <br /> <br />Thankfully I have the laserdisc widescreen version which I just  recently  put to DVD-R and so now I can enjoy MATILDA'S beautiful  picture quality and in its widescreen  beautiful glory!!  <br /> <br />By  the way,  the extras on  this special  edition  DVD is great, especially the  piece that Mara shot on the set of the movie. She uses a vidcam and,its just  so adorable. This is the best  part of all the extras in my  opinion. <br /> <br />So, even tho  the DVD is in fullscreen, which  really  stinks,  the extras  are a treat  and, oh yes, on some of the extras they show the widescreen version   and, this is nuts because if they used the widescreen  to show samples of how they did the special  effects and other things, then  WHY did they  not use the widescreen  version for the DVD??    <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this isn't emo at all.  This is metalcore with a thrashy edge.  And yes, my favorite genres of metal are melodic death and power metal (weird combo) and I listen to pretty much every type of metal such as black, thrash, and progressive but that does not change the fact that metalcore is bad.  This is the new wave of American metal and it is good.  Atreyu is not the new wave, but Unearth is clearly in a good direction. <br /> <br />Now, as with the European band similarities, I do hear many influences in the melodic death genre from the old melodic death masters such as Soilwork, In Flames, Arch Enemy, At the Gates and as well as some newer bands like Within Y and Omnium Gatherum.  However, the album is in no way emotional but merely catchy and will cause you to headbang!   <br /> <br />Let's admit, the new wave of American metal nametag is pretty dumb and is clearly for people who don't listen to European bands but listens to the 80's bands such as Metallica and Slayer (which are in no way bad).  These bands, namely KsE, Shadows Fall, Diecast, God Forbid, All that Remains, Haste the Day, and many more are metalcore but are really good bands.  Still, I think European metal kicks metalcore's ass, but its still pretty great. <br /> <br />BTW: there are some good american bands such as The Red Death, Arsis, and Capharnaum.  If you haven't heard of many of these bands, I suggest you check out metal from Sweden.
0066214122|5.0|It has been a long time since I have found myself unable to put a book down like I found myself with this one.  The novel begins with Jack Forman reflecting on his Mr. Mom role shopping for placemats and carting the kids around during 6 months of unemployment after blowing the whistle on his Silicon Valley boss and his subsequent dismissal.  His wife has been working long hours and has been somewhat absent while developing new technology that could change the course of medical treatment and be a huge breakthrough in medical technology.  But Jack is beginning to suspect that things are not what they seem at her job - is she cheating on him, is she on drugs, is the project she is working on all it really seems?  Jack finds himself with an opportunity to go work at the remote Nevada development center as a consultant, but he never anticipated what he would find there.   <br /> <br />This book goes on to detail the scientific developments in the medical arena and explores the possibility of what could happen when computer programming, medical procedures, and genetic engineering meet.  In this instance, the potential is disasterous and Jack and his fellow scientists try to stop the run away experiment before too many people get hurt.  However, Jack doesn't know who he can trust - including his own wife. <br /> <br />Crichton is at his best here.  Some of the science is above my head, but it did not interfere with my ability to follow along with the plot.  Even though I was fairly confident that the main character would make it in the end, I still turned every page with my heart in my throat wondering how he would make it out of each new thrilling scrape.  I haven't read a page turner like this in a long time - I will continue to be a big fan of Crichton and his writing.

And . . . <br /> <br />You get the idea. <br /> <br />The animosity among the characters grows from volleys of coy, flirtatious darts to the most artful and honest samurai-slick dueling I have ever witnessed, short of Nichols' other masterpiece, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. <br /> <br />At first, I wondered (in both films) why anyone would pair up with such a bitter, nasty human being in the first place, and in both cases I realized the characters (all of them) are in search of only one thing in a companion: a worthy opponent. <br /> <br />That it ends miserably for each of them is payment well spent; a medal well-earned. <br /> <br />And just when I think I've figured out where Nichols is going (very near the end), he pulls an ace from his sleeve in the form of Alice, stunning me into silent applause. <br /> <br />An articulate study of sick relationships at their best. And their worst. But which is which? <br /> <br />Bravo.
B000021XS0|1.0|This album is total crap. Not that I necessarily disagree with the claim \\"THIS IS THE BEST PROG METAL EVAR\\" - because it might well be, in a genre so devoid of merit! I don't even dispute the technical prowess of the band - but a handful of talented musicians does not a good album make. In fact, their skill is a disadvantage - because they know nothing about subtlety, the band just can't help filling every bar with absurd solos and masturbatory effects. Listening to the more overwrought tracks is like having Petrucci shove his slick, phallic guitar neck down your ear - greasy and painful, but at the same time you wonder, \\"How does he fit it all in?\\". <br /> <br />Even the most ignorant DT shill will have to admit that the lyrics are well below acceptable, even on an album as poor as this. They read like the existential whinings of a Goth teenager's livejournal, and sound even worse when delivered through LaBrie's malodorous maw. The band would certainly be better if LaBrie had died before this album was made, but then the same goes for any other member so he does not bear all the blame. <br /> <br />Mike Portnoy is revered by stupid drummers and drummers without taste alike. With an average bass-pedalling rate of 266BPM throughout the album, split between seventeen bass drums (not to mention the 112 snares and 139 cymbals in his regular setup), he is certainly the fastest. Once again, a band that looks good on paper fails to deliver in practice due to utterly contrived notions of artistry. This is the kind of music a 12 year old autistic savant would make if you gave him some music gear (and a pair of leather trousers and a black silk shirt!) - impressively and unnecessarily complex, but without real maturity or expression. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you're stupid enough to be a DT fanboy, you're stupid enough to love this tripe and hate people like me, who disagree with you so eloquently. I suppose I wrote this review partly because I want to save some people from a life of musical philistinism, but also because I want to warn any normal person who finds this album to STAY AWAY.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave is a good band, primarily based upon the 3/4 of Rage Against the Machine in it. Chris Cornell kind of creates an odd aura of listening enjoyability with RATM fans. I, for one, prefer RATM any day over Audioslave, but the sound RATM had was so unique, clever, and well-crafted, that I listen to Audioslave for that reason.  There is nothing cooler than listening to Tom Morello blast his trademarked guitar-effect solo in each song he has done.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this CD has great music on it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when I hear the tone of the musical section of Audioslave, I associate it with Zack De La Rocha's raspy, powerful, loud, and captivating voice. Chris Cornell sings completely differently than him, which refers back to the odd aura of listening enjoyability for RATM fans. <br /> <br />Other than me not being used to Cornell's voice, this CD is really good. I actually bought this CD, because I respect the RATM-core of the group that much.  I know that sounds kind of lame that I have to respect a group that much to get my lazy self off the computer and buy a CD, but it really is worth buying, even if you're going to copy the songs onto your computer.
B00042YBTK|4.0|I bought this album in the UK after trying to find it in the US in 1971.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Eric Burden, and especially the later Animals, this is a great album.  There are tracks such as River Deep, To Love Somebody and Gemini which are all great, showing not only the blues side but also the creative, experimental, psychedelic side of the group.   <br /> <br />What I find most endearing about this album is it rawness-not unusual for this period of The Animals.  <br /> <br />While the vinyl MGM album and my CD are indeed a bit flat in production sound, as were many of the MGM Animals albums IMHO, (think \\"needs extra bass and treble\\" on the stereo) in terms of performance, very fresh-almost like a \\"live studio album\\".   <br /> <br />Love Is is one Animals album that continues with the cool introspective spoken word side of Eric shown on Winds of Change and Every One of Us, and The Twain Shall Meet.  Another reviewer suggested deleting Gemini, and while admittedly 'op pop' in sound, I find I like the track.   <br /> <br />To prospective buyers, this album doesnt contain any pop radio tracks you will recognize.  Its still quite good for those of us who were introduced to Eric back when the Sun was Rising, and we were learning about the blues.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|...It's about dull. I have been a fan of this band since WD&DU, and welcome any & all musical experimentation & growth. The sad fact is simply that this album is just plain dull. I am surprised to see so many positive reviews of this album. It seems that too many reviewers equate musical growth and band cohesion with weak lyrics and \\"toned-down\\" songs. The mere fact that there is less shredding does not mean that the band has grown. DT has been far more cohesive and effective in the past, regardless of the \\"shred factor\\". While this album still has some good moments, (the excellent \\"Panic Attack\\", as well as \\"I Walk Beside You\\", for example) in my opinion this is their weakest offering to date, even more so than \\"Falling Into Infinity\\".
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD flat out rocks. Mariah really came back strong with this one and its wonderful. I really think she has one of the best voices out there, pure and powerful. The album carries a strong hip-hop flavor to it, but I love R&B so I thought it was great. Also, her more classic Mariah sounding songs are exceptional as well. Here's a quick run-down of my favorites and why. Joy Ride- I love it, the arrangement is amazing Fly Like a Bird- so inspirational, a beautiful song We Belong Together- we all know this song, we all love this song It's Like That- such a cool beat, excellent vocals Circles- heartfelt and classy. I'm so glad I bought this album because every song is great and Mariah deserves a round of applause.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Dream Theater since around 1998, and since then, I've bought all of their albums, and at least enjoyed all of of them to a greater or even greater extent.  One reviewer below mentioned that DT have two warring camps of fans: the progrockers, and the metalheads, and I couldn't agree more.  I, myself, definitely fit more in the \\"prog\\" camp, though I love a good headbanger from time to time. I was also one of the few who thought \\"Six Degrees\\" was a complete masterpiece, due to some very healthy exploration of sonic variation (I'm also a big radiohead fan, so go figure).  But I was completely uninterested by Train of Thought, and found it pining and repetitive and felt that the few \\"sonic explorations\\" on that album felt out of place and very contrived... and usually were in the forms of a split second sound effect between sections of a song, as apposed to finally integrated compositional elements. <br /> <br />Octavarium, on the other hand, follows as if Train of Thought almost never really happened at all (not completely though, there are moments when I can hear the existance of ToT, but they are work quite well), once again exploring more atmospheric and varied sound fields.  It is clear to me that the band who did \\"Images and Words\\" (a masterpiece in it's own right, and the album that got me into the band in the first place), is no more, and you know what?  I'm glad.  Images and Words is gone, Awake is gone, we have them already, we don't need another one.  So, if you're worried that Dream Theater have gone stale or stalled out from rehashing their previous glory, you have no reason to fret, Octavarium is on a different point in their evolution.  SfaM was the band's final goodbye to their early roots, and they are at home pushing forward, not looking back on illustrious \\"golden days\\". <br /> <br />There's still the crunch: tracks like \\"The Root of All Evil\\" continues the epic life jouney of the band's drummer, Mike Portnoy, on his struggle with alchoholism, and is the third installment of what (I'm expecting) will be a possible future concept album.  And the evidence of LTE shines through on the breakdown strack \\"Panic Attack\\".  \\"Never Enough\\" has it's moments of heaviness, as well as the miniepic \\"Sacrified Sons\\".  But most of the album falls along more the lines of progressive-melodic hard rock. <br /> <br />One auxillary note is that LaBrie's influence is much more prominant on this album than before.  His singing, itself, is not really any more upfront or highlighted; if anything, he's slowing turning a bit more Emo, which bothers me.  And they have also \\"allowed\\" him to pen more lyrics, all of which are horrid, insipid, and usually both.  But the up-side of all of this is that there is deffinitely more evidance of his instrumental songwriting on this album, and in such a way that it works quite well.  There are subtle (and not so subtle) strains of Mullmuzzler (his solo album) all over, especially the second section of Octavarium, which sounds a lot like \\"Shores of Avalon\\" (a Zeppelin influenced hard rocker that is the centerpiece of his first album). <br /> <br />Finally, the prog... lots of prog.  You'll hear many reviewers spout off old 70s prog bands as influence to this album, and they're ALL correct; in fact, most of the bands named turn up in a satirical lyrical section in the middle of their epic.  The most prominant are probably Genesis (lots of \\"Cinema Show\\"-like 7/8 sections abound the work) and Yes, though the construction of the lyrics during the particular section in question is a direct tribute to King Crimson's \\"The World's My Oyster Soup Kitchen Floor Wax Museum\\".  DT have always flaunted their influences, love it or hate it, and there's no lack of that on Octavarium, but it's hopefully evident enough that most of the skeptical \\"rip off\\" critics will realize that these are more unstubtle \\"winkings\\" at the audience as apposed to stolen goods. <br /> <br />So, if you're a metalhead looking for a good headbang, look elsewhere: Dream Theater, for now, is exploring new territory. But for the adventurous listener, especially one that enjoys exploring new directions using the old progrock formulas, get ready: there are good times ahead.
B000002G7E|5.0|Okay, so many years ago, I can't remember the exact year, but I was a teenager so it seems like a few billion, I was visiting a friend of mine in upstate New York.  This friend was schizophrenic, although at the time I knew little about such things; I only knew he was freakin' out of his mind.  (apologies to mental health and disabilities rights advocates, whom I think do good and valuable work, but this guy was loopy!)  At the time, my musical obsessions were the Beatles and Pink Floyd, and I loathed anything having to do with \\"heavy\\" or otherwise abrasive sounds.  This friend, who was afraid to approach a mailbox because he thought they were government spying devices, had a somewhat different take.  First he played for me the Sex Pistols, a group that I had never heard of.  I thought it sounded like two wolverines tied up inside a burlap sack being smashed against large rocks.  I hated it.  (of course, later on I would end up loving the thing for exactly the reason I just noted)  Undeterred, and dare I say a little emboldened by offending my sensibilities so thoroughly, he got out a worn copy of the Velvet Underground's second album, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" and slapped it on the turntable. (hey, I said it was a long time ago)  I have never been the same ever since.<br /><br />The opening title track to me sounded like an old Jerry Lee Lewis song being ripped to shreds by the aforementioned wolverines.  Right away, I was, to put it mildly, skeptical.  I believe my exact comments were \\"put this &%#@!!! away and let me play you side one of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" already\\"  He didn't budge.  Next came \\"The Gift\\" which was John Cale reciting a short story by Lou Reed over a stormy sea of guitars and Maureen Tucker's primal drumming.  As the recitation was in one channel and the music in the opposite, I could at least focus on the words, which were surreal enough to soothe my little hippie brain.  The next track, \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" got me hooked even more.  \\"This sounds like \\"I Am The Walrus!\\" I declared, \\"or even something from the first Floyd album!\\"  There was something far darker and sinister to this song, though.  \\"Here She Comes Now\\" confused me even more.  A soft melodic love song with sweetly strummed guitars, it didn't sound like the same group that was thrashing ole Jerry Lee.  \\"Just wait 'til side two\\" my friend snickered.<br /><br />\\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" is the nastiest barroom brawl of a song I had ever heard, and even today it has few equals.  Lou sounds like he's having an ugly physical confrontatiion with his guitar; the instrument is alive and boy is it not happy.  Even the sainted Jimi Hendrix would be scared.  It was anathema to me, yet it maintained an almost atavistic hold on my senses.  At this point I couldn't shut off the record if I tried.  Also, it's not wise to alarm a manic schizophrenic.  Anyway, then comes \\"Sister Ray.\\"  If you've ever uttered the cliche \\"over the top\\" and you haven't heard this song, you don't know what you're talking about, Pedro.  Seventeen minutes and twenty-seven seconds of relentless primitivistic howling scree, a black hole of misery and degradation, heck, a mother-lovin' celebration of misery and degradation.  The guitars sound like machines in a huge factory breaking down and headed for oblivion, but never getting there.  John Cale's organ, which was practically all I noticed the first few times I heard it, is demented, distorted, monolithic and utterly obsessive.  Tucker's drumming is the heartbeat of a transvestite shot up with so much smack that heshe would kill a cop after a round of, um, oral delights, which of course are what the lyrics describe.  In an uncharacteristic display of decorum that actually adds to the pervisity, Reed uses the phrase \\"suckin' on my ding-dong\\" instead of a more NC-17 wording!  Then, after at least one false ending, perhaps deciding that after a long day of metaphorically splitting minds open, they just, well, stop.  Just like that.No grand Wagnerian Ragnarok gestures, just goodbye and don't forget to turn off the lights on your way out, thanks.<br /><br />I sat there, glassy eyed and slackjawed for a full minute afterward.  Then I slowly turned my head to my friend, who was grinning maniacally, and I said, \\"that was the worst piece of garbage I have ever heard!  I'm sick to my stomach!\\"  Part of me still wanted to hear some Floyd, but I just couldn't.  I was seething.  I was violated.<br /><br />Naturally, the next week I went out and bought the album and listened to it so many times that if sweat could make a sound, it would sound like \\"Sister Ray.\\"that.  No grand Wagnerian Ragnarok gestures, just goodbye and don't forget to turn off the lights on your way out, thanks.   <br /> <br />I sat there, glassy eyed and slackjawed for a full minute afterward.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Of course, Coldplay has done 2 previous albums, but this is the one we've been waiting for. If you didn't give this band a second thought before, now is the time. There's no way you can miss them with X&Y. Their music this time around is epic. Unlike AROBTTH which featured only a bigger sound here and there, X&Y isn't shy and goes all the way. This is definitely Coldplay's time to shine BIG. This CD is wonderful. The bar has now been set for 2005. X&Y makes good look average. You haven't heard modern musical brilliance until you've witnessed X&Y. Don't be left in the dark. Buy this great album today.
0446613444|5.0|The first book in the series Black Echo was very good. Black Ice is great. Connelly captures the feeling of the city, the air, the tension, the danger, the possibility, and gives it his own literary twist. <br /> <br />Harry Bosch is a detective's detective. He is the flawed protagonist that other writers wish they could create. The frailty of his existence keeps Bosch fresh. <br /> <br />I know that sometimes the convenience of clues and sleuthing gets to some readers (I have a friend that does not like the series AT ALL because of it), but it doesn't bother me all that much. I just look at it as \\"tv police work\\" and that's ok as long as it is done well, and doesn't look like just a rip off of a television show. <br /> <br />I recommend all of the books in this series, but maybe Black Ice the most. <br /> <br />Ted
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Once again Dream Theater has given us another epic work with limitless talent.  Their ninth studio album, the 74-minute Octavarium, is still consistent with their previous works but at the same time, has changed in structure and sound in several ways.  The noticable changes include a whole entire symphony on the background, less guitar solos in exchange for more keyboard solos, less progressive song structures, (with the exception of the title track) and I think James Labrie sings a bit better and bit more on this album than in other albums.  The symphony orchestra is, in my opinion, positive addition.  I think it definitely increases the epicness of the songs and gives them more of a built-up sound.  Then again, Dream Theater has one of the greatest rock ensembles of all time and I'm not sure if it's really neccesary.  Onto the songs: <br />Root of All Evil is a heavy sequel to a series that includes The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul from the SDOIT and TOT albums written by Mike Portnoy.  It's chorus could be a bit stronger but overall a good intro and a decent song (8.25/10). <br />Answer Lies Within is a more radio-friendly and mainstreamish song as is I Walk Beside You.  It's pretty good but one of the reasons I listen to Dream Theater is to get away from these types of songs (8/10). <br />These Walls is actually one of my favorites off this album.  It's chorus is one of the more memorable ones, the orchestra is quite good in the background, and it's a definite highlight off this album (9.25/10). <br />I Walk Beside You, like Answer Lies Within is another more mainstream-like song and sounds a little like U2 who I don't really like too much.  The orchestra though is pretty good on this one (8/10). <br />Panic Attack, oh what an amazing song.  Furious, heavy, catchy, fast as hell and just plain amazing, Panic Attack is easily one of the best off this album.  There's not a single moment where it slows down and is an overall great song (10/10). <br />Never Enough is a bit average for Dream Theater but nontheless, is a decent track that is reminiscent of the band Muse (another amazing band) and has keyboards that stand out (8/10). <br />Sacrificed Sons reflects on 9/11 and is among the longest tracks on the album clocking in at 10:43.  A pretty good track and has one of the better choruses off the album (8.75/10). <br />Octavarium, the 24-minute title track, goes into the same category as such other Dream Theater epics as A Change of Seasons and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Featuring 5 separate movements, Octavarium isn't the most epic of all Dream Theater works but is certainly a treat to listen.  After the 4 minute intro, the title track goes through a whole array of movements and choruses until its apparent climax when Labrie yells \\"I'm trapped in this Octavarium!\\"  Certainly one of Dream Theater's highlights in their catalogue (10/10).
0670033375|4.0|Overall, an excellent book.  The fascinating historical studies of past civilizations drew me into this book, and the presentation of today's situation it left me with a much greater awareness of the seriousness of today's environmental challenges. <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed with the author's avoidance of the overused stereotype (common to many pro-environment works) that industry is necessarily a bad environmental steward.  Diamond does an admirable job contrasting good and bad environmental stewardship by industry, and the motivating factors that can lead to either situation. <br /> <br />Two small nitpicks:  First, the pace of the book gets somewhat tedious at times, but the result does tend to lend credibility to his arguments.  Second, his conclusion that the Greenland Norse's clinging to their Christian beliefs was a significant factor in their downfall was overstated.  It would have been more correct to identify the problem simply as the Norse's clinging to the outward cultural manifestations of mainland European Christianity.  (A look at Christian religious practices around the world today shows numerous examples where the outward manifestations of Christian religion have been adapted to the particular needs of local situations and cultures).
B000069HK2|3.0|This album is really good, surprisingly, The Used just had to turn awful.. but anways.. my favorite tracks on this album are \\"Blue and Yellow\\", \\"The Taste of Ink\\", and \\"On My Own\\". I'd buy this album if I were you, that is, if you don't like the new Used.
B00006I53S|4.0|When I bought my first Digital SLR (Canon D60) I coupled it with this lens and used it for about two years before going to a faster lense (Canon USM 24-70 f/2.8L)<br /><br />This is an excellent all about lens for those times when you either don't care to carry around multiple lenses or can't carry around multiple lenses.  Overall performance is quite satisfactory though sometimes with my D60 it had a tendancy to under-expose.  But with all things digital that is rather easy to correct in post-processing.<br /><br />Overal for a relative inexpensive lens with a good field this will be a great starter lense above the EF-S that seems to come standard with most digital SLRs these days which I'm not a fan of.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|To all the people not sure what side to take since your reading mixed reviews, some people just like to trash everything and dont know what good music is, take my word there's no way in hell that you won't atleast enjoy this album, you'll love it <br /> <br />Now, to all the people dogging this album: <br /> <br />you're all a bunch of complainers, ur way too critical in rating this this album, always complaining about something, too much shredding, not enough shredding, too heavy, not heavy enough, and some of you say Dream Theater has lost it.  The only people that have lost it is all you complainers.  YOu should all thank Dream Theater for getting better and better because their last few efforts  have by far been their best.  Images and Words was a good start (some good songs), Awake was not the great, very overated, with the exception of some good songs, Change of Seasons sucked, Infinitiy sucked even more.  The turning point was SCenes from a memory, and then 6 degress (mainly the Glass Prison and the 42 minute masterpiece), Train of Thought was everything that i wanted: awesome songs, shredding, and very heavy.  Now a lot of you say it had just too much shredding, now the shredding was perfect but the songs were VERY good, and this latest album, which a little more keyboard heavy just continues to prove my point.  They have just gotten a lot better with time. SO ALL OF YOU STOP WHINNING AND STOP BEING SO BLIND, and one more thing how could some of you say songs 1 and 2 be skipped? song #1 until now, so far, is my favorite song.  And song #2 is a an awesome ballad that, like one of you said, you'll be singing it over and over.  one of the two best songs on the album, and the 24 minute epic ender is just amazing. And one more song, i agree that the song \\"Panic Attack\\" should be rated in the top DT songs ever, along with the Mike Portnoy's AA Trilogy songs (Glass Prison, Dying Soul, and Root of All Evil, also just about all of TOT, the 42 minute 6th degree, and this album <br /> <br />DT rules NOW
0790734850|5.0|This was the best film made in '97 but like Polanski's \\"Chinatown\\" it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home. Curtis Hanson took James Ellroy's novel, a book many doubted could be translated to the film medium, and co-wrote one of the finest adapted screenplays ever done. He then brought on board a couple of Aussie unknowns, a gorgeous star who had never lived up to her potential, added perhaps the finest actor working today, and began filming one of the darkest noir films of all time, in sun drenched daylight.<br /><br />The end result is a dark and twisted tale of personal redemption told against the backdrop of the bright lights and sunshine of Hollywood in the early 1950's. Hanson contrasts the brightly lit exteriors with the dark storyline of police corruption and Hollywood decadence. This is a movie about facade, not just Hollywood's but our own personal facade as well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe became a star as Detective Bud White, a tough cop willing to do whatever is necessary, something the political up and comer Guy Pearce finds archaic about the force and wants to change. What may stop him from doing so is his investigation of the murder of several people at \\"The Night Owl\\" cafe, one of whom is Crowe's partner, who recently \\"retired\\" after a well publicized jail brawl christened \\"Bloody Christmas\\" by the papers.<br /><br />Crowe and Pearce come at this from different angles but the road for both leads right to beautiful Kim Basinger and a millionaire in the lush Hollywood hills played by David Strathairn. There is a reason Basinger looks a little like Veronica Lake the first time we see her in this film; she's supposed to. Hollywood legend has it that a string of expensive call girls were cut to look like stars during the 1940's and early 1950's and Hanson has made this darker side of Hollywood part of the story. Basinger is one of the lucky ones; close enough to the actual look of Veronica Lake not to have been cut on.<br /><br />Crowe falls for the real girl inside Basinger, but in spite of her opulent lifestyle, her low self-esteem comes to the forefront when she sleeps with Pearce in an attempt to \\"help\\" Crowe. We realize as she nearly destroys Crowe by doing so that she perceives herself as a whore on the inside, beneath the facade. Her logic is as twisted and tainted as the corruption Crowe and Pierce are about to uncover as they follow the trail linking Basinger's boss Strathairn to the Night Owl killings and the vice surrounding them on every side.<br /><br />Basinger may have garnered the Oscar for her role, but Crowe's performance as the tough cop with some soft spots after all is something you'll always remember. The coolest job done here, however, is by Kevin Spacey. Hanson told him before filming began to think Dean Martin and he'd have it down pat. Spacey did just that, playing the ultra cool cop, the one in the tabloids for his Hollywood connections. He is a consultant on the TV show \\"Badge of Honor\\" (think Dragnet) and is hooked up with slimy but likeable Danny DeVito, a writer for a Hollywood tabloid. Spacey grabs the spotlight and DeVito gets the headlines as Spacy collars Hollywood stars in compromising situations, DeVito's camera flashing.<br /><br />Spacey seemingly has it all, but like the rest of this film, it is just a facade. While sitting in a bar listening to Dean Martin in the background he looks up into the mirror behind the counter and doesn't like what is staring back at him. He has all the tools to be a great cop but he knows he has sold his soul for the fifty in front of him. He becomes involved in the case because of a murder in a hotel room he feels responsible for that leads right back to the Night Owl, and hooks up with Pearce to redeem his soul. You will never forget the name \\"Rollo Tomasi\\" or what it means for Pearce, and ultimately Spacey in this film.<br /><br />Adding to the atmosphere more than just a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since \\"Chinatown\\" and just as haunting. It does more than help enhance the atmosphere, it truly is the atmosphere of this one of a kind masterpiece. This film has the kind of ending dreams are made of and someone (I won't give it away) holding up their badge to the oncoming rush of cop cars in the Hollywood hills at night is a scene you'll never forget.<br /><br />There is not a bad performance in this film. It is complex and riveting. If you haven't seen this before, don't rent it, buy it. You'll watch it over and over. But don't tell anyone. This is Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush!ting.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says, this is one of the BEST albums ever made, ever heard. This is a fine piece of music history. Most recording artists can only dream of releasing an album this good. Like if \\"Thriller\\" had been done by a British Rock band, it would be \\"X&Y.\\" I can't believe how sharp and dynamic this album is. I've just never heard anything like it. AROBTTH is good, but \\"X&Y\\" is exquisite. Those whining and complaining must be listening to another album. This is a triumph and achievement on so many levels. This album reinvents music as we know it. It's nostalgic, yet progressive. Very, very, good. Not to be missed.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is an amazing album. Period. <br /> <br />With \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking The Fallen\\", Avenged Sevenfold built themselves up quite a following. Sure, those were both GREAT Metalcore albums. But with \\"City Of Evil\\", a lot of their fans are skeptic. Mainly for the reason that he doesn't scream, at all. This isn't really M. Shadows' fault. His scream comes mostly from his throat. This is a bad technique for screaming, seeing as it tears on your voice. M. Shadows actually HAD to stop screaming, or he may not be able to sing at all in the future. I could really care less, he has an amazing voice, and it shows on this album, time and time again. <br /> <br />The musicianship on this album is incredible. The guitar and bass work is amazing. The melodies are catchy, fast, metal, and dark all at the same time, without being annoying in the least. That's not easily done. The drumming is incredible. Being a drumer myself, I know how hard it is to pull of some of the licks and rythyms he does. Just listen to the short solo he does on \\"Beast & The Harlot\\" about 3:25 into the song. Incredible. <br /> <br />I understand some of the skeptics and long time fans complaints, but don't agree with them. Screaming doesn't HAVE to be in music of this sort. Listen to Blind Gaurdian, you'll know what I'm talking about. Great music is great music, whether the band is being \\"consistent with their style\\" or not, and this is most certainly great music.
B00023B1A8|5.0|The musicianship in this concert was enlightening.  I came away with a newfound respect for Crosby and Nash as players.  Like many people, I used to assume that Stills carried the instrumental sound by himself, but it takes an acoustic venue to see that his two partners can also carry their load.  \\"Just a Song Before I Go\\" is a great example -- first Nash, then Crosby surprising Stills with some nice filler riffs.  CSN also pull off great acoustic versions of \\"Long Time Coming\\" and \\"wooden Ships.\\"  \\"Marrakesh Express\\" was especially tasty to hear Nash's guitar work on the intro and to finally be rid of that terrible studio overdub synth/guitar/whatever that was on the original album and single version. <br /> <br />Keeping in mind that this concert was in 1991, the vocals are as close to a peak as CSN have achieved.  Crosby and Nash are right together on a beautiful rendition of \\"Guinevere\\".  Stills clearly doesn't have the same vocal chops as he had 35 years ago, but since he sings the low parts it's not noticable in the blend -- only when he steps out for a vocal lick or two. <br /> <br />My only nitpick is that I absolutely hate audience participation songs, and at the close of the concert they do this three times.  The \\"Friday evening...Tuesdays in the afternoon\\" section of \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" is classic CSN harmony, and they ruin it by letting the audience sing most of that part.  They do it again on \\"Our House,\\" (Stills looking strangely out of place singing backup vocals with Crosby on those cheesy lyrics), and later on the encore, \\"Teach Your Children.\\"  Gosh, I really don't want to hear several hundred really ordinary people sing those parts -- I want to hear the Blessed Three Cherubs on stage!   <br /> <br />But for ten bucks, I guess I'll put up with it.  The wonderful blend on \\"Find the Cost of Freedom\\", which is about 30 seconds tacked onto \\"Daylight Again,\\" is worth the price of the DVD all by itself. <br /> <br />The post-credits note that some audio sweetening was performed.  Exactly what that means, I can't fathom, but once I get past the annoyance of the audience participation, I can sit back and relax and enjoy this great performance.  How good was it?....I watched it twice in a row.
B00097DX3U|2.0|After such unforgettable excitement every time RATM would make a new album or appear on stage, after all these years of unsettled revolution against the things we hate, Audioslave comes up with a boring album, of which 2-3 tunes save the faces of the four rock heroes.  Weirdly enough, when I first heard Audioslave (1st album) I had this terrible feeling that it was the end of an era.  I will never say \\"shame\\", just money thrown out of the window.  Messrs. Morello & Co., you're out of focus because you try to do something which is not genuine and fresh.  Take some holidays and come back!!
B0000025KI|5.0|I played this album a lot in the eighties, mainly as background music. I like the rhythm of the album, which is predominately up-tempo. Bruce wrote all the songs and his voice, though limited in range, is ideally suited to the music. I never paid too much attention to the lyrics back then, feeling no need to back then. That wouldn't make for much of a review, so when I finally got round to reviewing the album, I decided to find out what the songs are actually about. As with Bruce's other albums, the songs here show that Bruce is very observant. He sees things that happen in life and uses his incredible songwriting talent to capture what he sees in song. Many of the songs are melancholy (even some of the rocking up-tempo songs) but there are enough lighter songs to provide a contrast.  <br /> <br />The album opens with The ties that bind, about a woman afraid to commit herself to love, yet yearning for true love, or so it seems. Sherry darling is about a man who loves a woman but finds her mother irritating. Jackson cage is about a woman trapped in a situation she can't get out of although Bruce leaves open to interpretation exactly what the Jackson cage is. Independence day is a very sad song about a son leaving his father's home after years of not getting on with each other  <br /> <br />Hungry heart, about escape from the wife and kids, provided Bruce with a major American hit, also giving him his first (minor) UK hit. Out in the street is about a couple meeting at the weekend after a hard week's work. Crush on you is about a fantasy. You can look but you can't touch is (as you might expect) a song about various situations in life where all you can do is look. I wanna marry you is a very touching song in which Bruce observes an unsmiling single mother struggling with her children and sees something in her that is not immediately apparent. The title track is about bad memories that won't go away.  <br /> <br />Point blank is about a woman who ends up in the wrong company and comes to a bad end. Cadillac ranch, by contrast, is a fun song I'm a rocker finds Bruce offering to rescue a woman from another man with whom she seems to be unhappy. Fade away is about the end of a relationship. Stolen car is about a relationship that has gone cold but not ended. Ramrod is a fun song in which Bruce tries to tempt a woman to go ramrodding. The price you pay is about the consequences of pursuing dreams and what can go wrong. Drive all night is a simple love song. Wreck on the highway is about Bruce's memories of an accident and how he reflects on it.  <br /> <br />This album works brilliantly as background music, but as I discovered when I looked deeper into it, there are a lot of fascinating songs here. My favorites (some because of the music, others because of the lyrics) are Cadillac ranch, I wanna marry you, You can look but you can't touch, The price you pay, Sherry darling and Independence day, but you may have different favorites - there's a lot of great music here.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I am a hardcore DT fan but I am afraid I can't swallow this latest opus- as many have stated where is the creativity? where are the magical moments when you either cry, get goosebumps or are in awe of their technical prowness? (see IAW, Awake, SFAM or even SDOIT) <br /> <br />Well, it took  me a while to accept Train of Thought, but at least they were commited- they had tried, wandered another path- not to all fans satisfaction- but they did it with gusto. <br /> <br />Now, what do we have? A bad catalogue of their possibilities-  a caricature of themselves- (check that U2 esque song..)and worse the whole album is hollow.(besides,the \\"tribute to Floyd\\" on Octavarium is terrible apart for the latest part of the song which reminds us that on other albums, DT ruled. <br /> <br />A french listener said: RIP DT-  well, if they do not wake up soon, and stop selling out (that's what this album is), the band should better split instead of having us fooled and dissapointed.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is their worst album, no questions asked, but it is still very good. Coldplay don't have a bad album and never will. The songs on this album are all good. The album grows on you with time, but there are not a lot of classic songs like on Rush Of Blood To The Head. Many great songs, but the other albums are better with catchier songs. I don't really see how anyone can dispute this.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Robert Altman used to be a great director who wielded one mean camera.<br /><br />Now he's become a cinematic sadist looking for a masochistic victim. If you watch \\"Gosford Park\\", you're the victim, and Altman is the leather-clad gimp.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\", Robert Altman's self-referential and cleverer-than-thou deconstruction of Agatha Christie's great whodunits, is crammed to its Victorian manor home garrets with enough actors to stage a full-scale invasion of Normandy (and win!), obsessively detailed, and repulsively self-absorbed. This is a strange and decidedly post-modern mixture of all-Plot and no-Plot, a smirking deconstructionist manifesto masquerading as a 1930's murder mystery.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\" doesn't entertain, thrill, or amuse: it bores. It is a new twist on cinema, to be sure: the Movie as Torture Device.<br /><br />Roughly a million primary, secondary, and tertiary English characters and their servants converge on the remote English manor home of William and Sylvia McCordle (played in desperately work-manlike fashion by Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas, respectively) for an extended week-end of dining, mumbling, and grouse-shooting, with an extra serving of mumbling.<br /><br />Our battalion of mumblers, Upper and Lower Class, maneuver around and about the ornately appointed chambers and elegantly manicured grounds of the Victorian manse, wheedling and plotting and whispering and, of course, mumbling. Elderly dame Constance Trentham (played acutely by Maggie Smith, who could do this sort of period dance in her sleep by now, and probably did) wheels whispering about the dining room and parlor of the estate, worrying about status and couth.<br /><br />The hapless Meredith couple (Tom Hollander, Natasha Wightman, turning in fine roles as middle-class mumblers) are trying to wrangle a deal with the elderly, grumbling, blackhearted Lord McCordle. Lady Sylvia (Thomas) is wan, capricious, fickle and unhappy; Lord William (Gambon) is bellicose, loud, and rugose.<br /><br />Everyone is unhappy. Everyone mumbles.<br /><br />Downstairs the staff mumble, but in Cockney accents, so whereas the Upper class mumbling is understandable, the soupy Yorkshire-to-Southwark gurgles will doubtless cause you to curse and demand subtitles. Alas, no help is forthcoming, and you'll spend a few minutes rewinding the DVD to try, desperately and futilely, to figure out what that First Footman said. Or was it the 4th Beater? Never mind. You'll be so absorbed muddling through the accents and the mumbling it won't really matter.<br /><br />There are a number of inevitable collisions between the gallant forces of Upstairs and the stolid and stoic servitors Downstairs as Things Come to a Head, portrayed through awkward pauses in dinnertime chit-chat (read: stilted mumbling punctuated by gasps) and startling revelations during tea-time at the McCordle Gazebo.<br /><br />None of this makes for an interesting movie. Indeed, it makes for something approximating Hell on Earth.<br /><br />\\"Gosford Park\\" drowns in its own smug self-satisfaction, its endless mumbling, its dry-and-unaffected seminal murder sequence (presented almost as an afterthought), its muddle-headed and moronic Scotland Yard investigator (played foolishly by the great and underrated Stephen Fry, who sinks without a cry in this murky soup), and its anti-climactic \\"conclusion\\".<br /><br />This is not to say that the \\"Gosford Park\\" ship sinks without a mighty effort from its crew. The captain may be drunk at the helm, but the acting is terrific throughout, in spite of the mumbling: Dame Maggie Smith entrances as always, Kristin Scott Thomas does wonders with her thankless role, Michael Gambon rages and goes not softly into the dying of the Light, Helen Mirren is an oasis of dignity and desperate reserve, Derek Jacobi carves out precious little slices of the film and makes them his own, and the great Charles Dance and the inimitable Richard Grant do what they can with the material they have.<br /><br />I will also admit that the world of \\"Gosford Park\\" is handsomely mounted---like most dead wild beasts that have been shot and stuffed---and kudos go to Director of Photography Andrew Dunn (who stirred up the bewitching cinematography in \\"The Madness of King George III\\" and \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\"), set designer Anna Pinnock (who moved on to \\"Van Helsing\\") and costume design by Jenny Beavan, (\\"Alexander\\") and has about a million Jane Austen treatments under her belt. Everything looks smashing.<br /><br />Alas, \\"smashing\\" isn't the word that comes to mind about the larger work of \\"Gosford Park\\". 'Dull' is. For a movie that demands this much of its audience, \\"Gosford Park\\" really doesn't seem to care that much about its plot, its characters, or its resolution---and certainly not its audience.<br /><br />To those who want to see the British class system skewered, buy \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\". To those looking for some ghoulishness mixed in with their rich Edwardian atmosphere, pick up \\"Clue\\" or \\"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\\".<br /><br />To those who want to lose more than two hours of their life to a mumbling, plotless, aimless and colorless British costume drama helmed by a director who has seen better days, pick up \\"Gosford Park\\". Just don't say you weren't warned in advance.<br /><br />I would rather have someone drive red-hot pokers into both of my eyes than ever watch this vile thing again.<br /><br />JSGe Richard Grant do what they can with the material they have.  <br /> <br />I will also admit that the world of \\"Gosford Park\\" is handsomely mounted---like most dead wild beasts that have been shot and stuffed---and kudos go to Director of Photography Andrew Dunn (who stirred up the bewitching cinematography in \\"The Madness of King George III\\" and \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\"), set designer Anna Pinnock (who moved on to \\"Van Helsing\\") and costume design by Jenny Beavan, (\\"Alexander\\") and has about a million Jane Austen treatments under her belt.

B00097A5HW|5.0|I bought this album today and I've been listening to it quite very often.. a lot of the songs are just so different from anything she has done before.. Im not sure why some people didnt like it, I honestly dont think its missing anything.. well I guess they could have added more than 10 songs, maybe like 13 or 14 not including remixes or acoustic versions. Overall this cd is great, I loved it and I cant wait for Volume 2 to come out November!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Here we have a sequel with even a better story, yet loses the audience because of the decision to go hand-held through some of the best scenes in the film.  There is nothing wrong with using the hand-held technique (there is a grittiness and realism to hand-held camera work), as long as one doesn't over do it.  A little goes a long, long way, especially on the big screen.  Fortunately, watching the BOURNE SUPREMACY on a TV screen didn't give me the headache I had in the theater.  It's really a shame the director didn't realize this, because overall, he did a heck of a job.  He kept the tension throughout, the fight with the other Treadstone agent was great, and the car chase was spectacular (including the camera angles within the car itself) ... that is ... if we could have actually seen these scenes! <br /> <br />The Bourne series has terrific potential, and I really like Matt Damon's presentation of this super agent.  You can see this guy thinking all the time, no matter what mundane task he is doing (walking, talking, eating, etc.).  There seems to be a million things flying inside Bourne's head every minute of the day and it's a pleasure to watch.  It also doesn't hurt that there is something extremely compelling about a man on the run, and it's always been that way (cue in a hundred movies and TV series here, beginning with THE FUGITIVE). <br /> <br />So how do I rate this film?  Considering how much I enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, I'd say that SUPREMACY is actually better, except for the problems stated (that and the fact I was disappointed with an early plot decision concerning Marie).  I would easily have given this a 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating if not for the camera work.  Still, the story is that good, the acting is very solid, the locations wonderful, and the tension remains strong enough throughout for me to give it 7 out of 10, or 4 stars.  I'm eagerly looking forward to another installment.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|As is typical for Matt Stone and Trey Parker, there are no sacred cows in TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE.  They make fun of just about everyone and everything as we witness the brash, macho antics of Team America during its pursuit of terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, and the hilariously-portrayed North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Il.<br /><br />People of both liberal and conservative persuasions will find a great deal to laugh at in this film, while the only people liable to not be laughing are the various Hollywood stars who come off looking like know-nothings and self-important losers.  Alec Baldwin in particular has earned the ire of Parker and Stone, culminating in an exploding-head sequence that left me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />Like \\"South Park\\", this movie is NOT for kids.  It's foul-mouthed and graphically sexual (yes, Supermarionettes can be sexual!  Just watch!!) with an endless downpour of gratuitious violence.  But then, that's the point, as the creators themselves concede in the special features when discussing the genesis of this script and its journey to the silver screen.<br /><br />I think this movie will only get better with age.  Is it too early to brand it a classic?  I've seen it several times already, and each time, I laughed more.  A brilliant piece of work whose adoring attention to the art and detail of puppeteering, combined with outrageous satire, make it a truly one-of-a-kind viewing experience.<br /><br />Like the theme song says, \\"AMERICA!  F*** YEAH!!!!\\"
B00001OH7P|5.0|There is something to be said about not only David Bowie albums of the late 60's-early 70's, but records in general that were released during that time. Today many albums are recorded in a frenzy, half-heartedly, bypassing the great storytelling that \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\" encompasses. Bowie takes the listener on a trip through the journey and mind of his alter ego, Ziggy Stardust, through an incredible amalgamation of songs. This album is of epic proportion when placed next to, say, the spectacular \\"Hunky Dory\\" (another Bowie must-have). From the opening track \\"Five Years\\", the tone and the story set the pace for a listening experience like few have done before. \\"The Rise and Fall...\\" is theatrical, melodic, sexy, full of swagger and sass--all while keeping to a basic theme. \\"Suffragette City\\" and \\"Lady Stardust\\" are delicious opposites in terms of tempo and tune, but both evoke the same thrill. \\"Soul Love\\" has the ability to take your emotions from contentment to an unexplainable upswing with it's choral melody. If there's one thing aside from genius storytelling that David Bowie knows, it's bridges and choruses. \\"Moonage Daydream\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" will likely blow you away, and I challenge someone to tell me that nearly half this album did not, in fact, influence some of the most popular bands of today. Take for instance \\"Rock n Roll Suicide\\"--listen to that then listen to the Arcade Fire. I also challenge someone to tell me that this is not one of the best makeout albums of all time. Arguably the best Bowie release to date, and my personal favourite, \\"The Rise and Fall...\\" is an imperative addition to anyone's music collection. If epics are your cup of tea, also try \\"Aladdin Sane\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs.\\"
B000002MU3|4.0|I'll keep this short but I have to say this is my favorite REM album and I have all of the 80's ones up to this one.  Peter Buck really really shines here with some wonderful fuzzy, distorted guitar and Stipe contributes great lyrics and vocals as usual.  The 1st two tracks are my favorites but its all high quality music to me.  So I agree with the reviewer that says give this album a chance and listen with an open mind. I highly recommend it!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Outstanding effort, but the fact that this album is only 38 MINUTES LONG positively REEKS of greed and hypocrisy, especially given the strident anti-consumerism espoused by the band.  If Hypnotize is the same lenth, SOAD's loyal fans will have gotten a wonderful one-for-the-price-of-two deal.  Yuck.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Ok the musicianship is defaintly there for the most part but what the heck happened to the vocals. They really got annoying on this album. Defaintly not another Waking The Fallen. Now I say this listening to Coheed and Cambria who have even more high pitched vocals then on this album. But the difference with Coheed is that Coheed's vocals work with the musicianship on their albums. This album however it just doesn't work for me. I give it a two because there's still a load of talent within the musicianship.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I laughed non-stop throughout the movie. A combination of sex, action, car chases and shoot outs, the likes you've never seen!<br /><br />Not a kid's movie, but nonwadays, what is?<br /><br />I salute the writers for their story, the producers for having the courage to make this movie and the rest of the crew that helped.<br /><br />GJG<br /><br />Fresno, California
B0000C7PRY|4.0|If you will recall, one \\"cover\\" Neal Morse tackled along with Mike Portnoy and Roine Stolt on their first Transatlantic album was the Procol Harum epic \\"In Held 'Twas In I\\". That track also dealt with a spiritually-oriented experience of self-discovery. There's got to be a creative connection between that track and this album. When Neal Morse bolted Spock's Beard after their \\"Snow\\" release, I had a reaction of despair along the lines of how I felt when Gabriel left Genesis. It was reinforced by Morse's first album while still with the group, a bland 80's pop effort at best. But this album has a lot of what earlier S-B albums have: extended multi-thematic works. Which is a feature of all prog epics from \\"Tarkus\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\" onward. They're not one-piece symphonic movements, they're medleys built on a recurring theme, more like \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\". On earlier S-B albums, those segments had titles: they just weren't each tracks in their own right. Which had to have made a lot of S-B fans panic when the \\"V\\" release came out (\\"omigawsh, a bunch of piddly short stuff\\"). Then they put the thing in the player and got the long number they were used to. That's how this album is, despite how the track listing makes you think it's 15-per-disc. Actually it makes a lot of sense. You can't always spare the time for a 20-minute number in an uninterrupted run. So, with \\"V\\" and this album, you pay attention to where it was when you stop, then you take up where you left off. I guess the bottom line is that if you liked \\"Kindness Of Strangers\\" and \\"Beware Of Darkness\\" but found the monolithic \\"Snow\\" a bit too massive to swallow, this album is the logical next step-that-might-have-been-taken.<br /><br />Okay, let's get back to the spiirital part. I'm surprised there can be such a thing as Christian Rock in my country. Rock started out half-a-century ago being called \\"satanic\\" by a bunch of Jimmy Swaggart wannabees who didn't have a leg to stand on other than the fact that they had all the power and we were just snot-nosed kids. They were speaking from an aesthetic standpoint and didn't have to admit that was all it was. Right and wrong was what they bleeping-well said it was, punctuated with a smack upside the head and a go to your room. This created a corresponding zealotry on our our side of the issue that was just as hypocritical. That penomenon survives to this day in the person of \\"rock'n'rollers\\" who will not tolerate God or Jesus interfering with entertainment. It's reinforced nowadays by the fact that this is the age where plaques of the Ten Commandments are being forcibly removed from courthouses and teenage girls are being tossed out of school for saying a prayer over the school stadium PA before a scholastic sporting event. My own spin on it is that it's about time the more imaginitive and creative artists like Morse and Stolt (\\"Flower Kings\\") counterbalanced the Biblical Britneys and Jesuit Justins dominating Christian Rock now. After all, if Christian music isn't supposed to be involved and comlex, how do you explain earlier generations' approach to sacred music through the voices of Brahms and Bach? There wouldn't be any such work as \\"The Messiah\\". And if God doesn't belong in Rock, how do you explain the fact that the still-acknowledged King Of Rock'n'Roll recorded more than one album of hymns? In the founding days of prog, it got run out of town because it was too \\"artsy\\", when the truth was that it overtaxed short attention spans. With the current generation of prog, you aren't supposed to use the G-word. And it's also obvious what the underlying argument is this time as well. Listen up, people, this is no jihad--it's ENTERTAINMENT.ey had all the power and we were just snot-nosed kids.

0767830555|4.0|Martin Scorsese has outdone himself with this film. DeNiro brilliantly portrays Travis Bickle as a slowing down spiraling taxi driver bent on \\"cleaning up the city\\" through violence. Although the movie may have a slower pace it is gripping. Those of you who would say \\"boring\\" maybe you should check out Battlefiel Earth instead. Incredible acting, camera work, direction and cinematography.

B000001ELP|4.0|I never disliked this album,but I guess I was brainwashed by others into thinking this album was sub-par. It is not by any means. <br /> <br />Over the years since THE ELDERS release, I have grown-up & learned new things as well as opened my mind to things that I would have never thought I would have enjoyed (i.e classical music)and therefore, I recently rediscovered the Elder, not necessarily as a KISS album or a Hard Rock album, but as a piece of music.  <br /> <br />I was quite impressed with the band, on this album you can tell  <br />they were trying harder then ever to show their critics they had talent and were not some dumb rock n'roll band. On the Elder, for the must part, they succeded.  <br /> <br />After the thin sound & weak songwriting of UNMASKED, the Elder should have been a welcome return with it's rich, full sound. I wish they put this much effort into subsequent releases.  <br /> <br />So open your ears & mind and enjoy. Stop listening to others opinions and give it a chance....
B0006L16N8|5.0|For me, without a doubt, this is their best CD.  I liked a few songs on Rush of Blood to the Head and a few on Parachutes, but they didn't seem like cohesive CDs to me and were a little tiring/boring IMO.  I'd give them both 3 stars.    So, I wasn't expecting much from X&Y.  I even tried to dislike Speed of Sound.  I was wrong.  First of all, Speed of Sound is a melodic joy of a song.  The twist to the melody at the end after what seems to be a fade out gives me chills every time.    Put Speed of Sound, as a song, in context and we're talking about an emotional climax!  The first half of the album sounds AMAZING.  It seems fairly thematic to me as if being about loss of confidence in the moves you make in life or feeling emptiness as in Talk--    \\"do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?\\"    or loss of love/loved one in the INCREDIBLE SONG, \\"Fix You\\":   \\"and the tears come streaming down your face  when you lose something you can't replace  when you love someone but it goes to waste  could it be worse?\\"    Near the middle of the CD, the song \\"X&Y\\" summarizes everything in a haunting melody and fades away...  It's a bit of a sad moment.  The preceding songs were fairly sad, if not extremely well written and sonically gorgeous.    THEN!!!!!  Speed of Sound arrives with its lovely riff.  Positivity.  It's a re-birth.  It's brilliant!  It's about getting out of your sadness and realizing that life has so much more to offer than just sadness and loss.    How long do I have to climb,  Up on this side of this mountain of mine?    Look up, I look up at night,  Planets are moving at the speed of light.  Climb up, up in the trees,  every chance that you get,  is a chance you seize.  How long am I gonna stand,  with my head stuck under the sand?  I'll start before I can stop,  or before I see things the right way up.     It's a song of hope and renewal.  The rest of the CD has similar positive messages (roughly).      This truly is a CD about \\"X & Y\\".  love & loss.  negativity & positivity.  good & bad.  The whole thing sounds sonically WAY more exciting than the first two CDs and the lyrical content is nothing short of emotional and touching in the very best sense of the word.    I'm impressed. :)  5 stars.  I strongly believe this will become a classic in my collection.  I usually need a couple years to say such a thing, but this CD has it all.  It is so much more mature and well crafted than the first 2 CDs.  Beautiful!!!
B0009VRHLK|5.0|kubrick says, \\"One man writes a novel, one man composes a symphony, and one man directs a film\\". Of course Gallo obviously embraces this point of view, but the motivation is not about narcissism. Kubrick gave himself up for what he loved didnt he? Its about personalism, honesty, and being bold without compromise. What Gallo does here can be appreciated on many levels, and at the same lacks all pretension. The superficial metaphors and 'juxaposition' that film school tries to celebrate as 'expression' cannot be located in his work. Don't get me wrong, theres plenty of ambiguity and poetic visions throughout the film, but isn't it nice to be 'left alone' by a film as opposed to being taken hostage like most of modern cinema. The generosity of the style and the temporal narrative, the emergent quality of the films composition and music, and subtle performances.. If you havent noticed, American cinema has been largely uninteresting in recent times, and because of our nostalgia for past works, the filmmakers have no insight that warrants singular, let alone repeated viewings. This film is 'open' in the philosophical sense, for speculation and discourse, and can shed light on the behaviors we exhibit in times of pain and terror. Of course Gallos aesthetic sensibility has been cultivated in such a way, that he goes to his subject with the eye of a child, in the best sense, and shows us a reality that we could normally miss. 'Time', 'future', finitude', 'attachment', all work at once in our everyday existence, just as he presents, and doesnt always come in totally unique and extreme scenerios.  Now isnt this kind of reflection, posed by an avid intellect, what film is all about.  Here Gallo only does what every heavyweight director has done, which is to introduce an artistic language that has only existed in other mediums up to that point, to stretch the possibilities. Minimalism his obvious choice. Much has been said about the explicit scene, and the question of its neccessity. Film is about IMPACT, it always has been, the nature of the shot gives it its psychological power, and leaves the viewer having to take a look in the mirror at his or her own sexual practices and the pathologies behind them. Of course you could have an Oliver Stone inferiority complex with added penis envies to boot and hate the the personality of the filmmaker, but the film itself, is still very special...
0451207521|4.0|This book is dedicated to the brave women of the Special Operations Executive that were dropped in occupied France. They took immense risks for the right cause. For our freedom. Follett creates the character of Felicity Clairet (\\"Flick\\") and lets us experience the dangers she encounters when she is dropped in France to assist the resistance. Very good WWII thriller.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|Seabiscuit <br /> <br />1-liner: The lives of three men intersect as they take a huge chance on a broken horse, destined for victory, fated to fix all of them. <br /> <br />The nature of the film can be summed up by one phrase: you win some, and you lose some--and yes, bathos and tears are mandatory. It starts in the decades before the Great Crash to precede the 1930s, when one could go from 21 cents to riches. Everyone seems to be winning. Charles Howard goes from rags to riches, the Pollard family is affluent and is blessed with well-educated children, the farrier Tom Smith still has free land and wild horses to run with. The onslaught of the 1930s changes things for everyone, stealing the precious.  <br /> <br />Charles Howard is shown working at a factory as a manual laborer fixing spokes, and then he decides to start his own bike shop. The film shows his first encountering of an automobile, his realization that it's cars that's the future. He becomes a star salesperson and eventually the owner (or one in charge of lay-off's) of Buick. He wrestles happily with his baby son, as his wife reads the latest Buick press release in the paper. <br /> <br />Mr. and Mrs. Pollard, Red Pollard's parents, are shown admiring their son on a horse. \\"He looks so perfect on it--that's the poetry of it,\\" Mr. Pollard epithets his son while he rides. They are reasonably affluent and their children are well-educated, quoting Dickinson off memory.  <br /> <br />Tom Smith, the farrier, rides in the vast open space, unclaimed land, and rounds up the fastest wild horse. He has it in him to tame a crazy horse. A horse, which anyone else would have given up on and shot.  <br /> <br />The Great Crash comes along, and the narrator admits that the suicides are myths history would later spin up. The effects are gradual, and they take hold differently for all, but there is a common element to each tragedy. Howard's son dies in a freak accident, which his wife blames him for. The Pollards decideit is better to leave their son -- Red Pollard -- to a man affiliated with the local racetracks. The boy is sixteen. <br /> <br />Six years later, Red races. However, he is fouled--distracted by the cheating racer who attempts to push him off the horse--and he loses on his sponsor's best horse. He loses his job and ego, and he becomes a drifter, like the millions of others.  <br /> <br />The farrier Tom Smith is seen to be a crazy man who puts hope and care on crazy horses.  <br /> <br />Charles' wife has abandoned him, and he goes to TJ--at the time, the only place where alcohol and gambling are allowed.  <br /> <br />The three men are lost. But, losing always comes with winning.  <br /> <br />Charles meets Tom, and he decides to invest in him as a farrier--despite his age and crazy reputation according to the other farriers. Charles asks Tom why he puts in so much care into the wounded white horse with the fractured leg he had saved from the bullet. Tom claims although the horse can't race, he's good for other things. \\"You don't throw a whole life away, just because he's banged up a little.\\"  <br /> <br />Thus goes the prevalent motif in the story - that of second chances.  <br /> <br />Charles hires Tom to find a good race horse for him to invest in. Seabiscuit just happens to trot by, as Red takes on the cheapest paying lowest job ever, warming-up the horse. Tom sees it in his eyes, the spirit of the horse--he claims the secret to a winning horse isn't in his heart, but that it is in-grained in its soul.  <br /> <br />Seabiscuit, however, is a horse no one wants. Although he comes from good breeding, he is too gentle, too small. The odds are against him. Moreover, the trainers who took him broke him, using him as a losing horse to train the other horse ego. When Tom finds him, Seabiscuit is something of a crazy horse, taking several men just to partially handle him. Tom knows that there is winning engraved in that horse's destiny, but he just had to find the man to settle him.  <br /> <br />Beautiful deux ex machina: Meanwhile, across the street, Red just happens to be involved in a brawl--the parallel between Seabiscuit attempting to take on a whole team of farriers and Red attempting to take on a whole gang of antagonists is elegantly portrayed.  <br /> <br />The boy and his horse--they win against all odds. A rider who is half blind and a horse abandoned. The common background shared by both boy and horse is subtle, but tear-rendingly elegant--both come from prided heritage, yet they are separated from their family (cute young Seabiscuit shown wrenched from his father), forced into the real world far too young, and then shattered and lost by the slings of life.  <br /> <br />The second chance given and accepted. Seabiscuit and Red's victories are shown in conjunction with FDR's New Deal, how it up'ed the low of many men.  <br /> <br />The film starts out as if a documentary with b/w photos; the \\"documentary feel\\" is interlaced throughout the story. While this may seem to distance the viewer, the scenes carrying the plot of the story are strikingly real, amazingly, tearfully heartful--such that one feels as if one is \\"living history.\\" This effect is flaunted when a b/w photo is made real into a motion scene, the b/w fading into color gradually.  <br /> <br />Casting: probably the most perfect cast ever. Charles looks kind of like the dopey sort of guy who would get lucky by his sheer faith in people--the way his mouth always does that. Tom looks old, yet haggard and wise and very sane, despite what the other farriers see of him prior to this discovery by Charles. And, Red... he just has to be Peter Parker--or Peter just has to be Red.  <br /> <br />(I was actually a bit fazed the first time I watched it through, the screen was a bit blurry, and I actually thought that both fathers and the farrier were the same man--thus, I was a bit confused for a while. However, after re-watching the beginning, things made much more sense..)
0060776579|5.0|This book will leave you feeling like you just got a very, very, very strong financial kick up the b*m!! A very, very big one. It comes across as if you were sitting in a seat at one of his seminars. He says \\"Don't believe a word he says\\" Why? Because as he says he can only speak from his own experience of thinking rich. He encourages you to do his suggested exercises, visit his website, go to his seminars. Reading it, you are forced to examine your money programming. From the first page, he hits you sharply with humour, fact and lovely anologies to get the point home. I like the quotes: 'You always find ways to validate your money programming' and 'No thought lives in our heads rent free. It's there as an investment or a cost.' He reminds us we are free to think. Whether we think rich or think poor, it is our choice. After reading you definitely will be asking yourself Wow, just \\"What is my money level thermostat set at\\"? I end this review with whether you are a beginner or expert in personal finance, read the book yourself because \\"Don't belive a word I say\\" <br />
0060989157|5.0|I grew up with Motley Crue so naturally I had to read their book.  Wow!  When I got this book I couldn't put it down, even when my eyes were burning and telling me it's time to sleep.  I loved the way it was written and how each member filled a chapter or two on their memories of struggling, hitting many down falls and then making it big.  Oh the stories that unfold in this book, make me still love them till this day.  If you are a die hard Motley fan....do get it!
B00005QEO1|2.0|I loved Aerosmith in the 70s. This album is just too cold to be likeable for me.  <br /> <br />The recording is that 80s big-hair sound (is that Aerosmith or Def Leppard on \\"Love In An Elevator?). And it's missing those classic Aerosmith details - the jazzy Joe Perry solos with the little non-pentatonic touches, the deep bottom end, and the classic chromatic riffs. F.I.N.E. is the only song I can give a nod to.  <br /> <br />I understand the need to change, but I think they took a little too much away from what made them unique and replaced it with \\"the norm.\\" <br /> <br />Old fans - you'll probably be disappointed like me.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Show me the blueprints.  Show me the blueprints.<br /><br />Bring in the milk.  Bring in the milk.<br /><br />After having seen The Aviator in the theater, I was duly impressed with DiCaprio's acting performance, but after having watched the plentiful special features on this all-encompassing DVD, I am even moreso in awe of the phenomenal job DiCaprio did in all but engulfing himself into the formidable role of Howard Hughes and his innumerable indiosyncracies.  DiCaprio recounts on the special features segment pertaining to OCD of how it took him 10 minutes to walk from his trailer to the set due to him being so engrossed into the ways of OCD and engaging in seemingly mundane tasks multiple times as a result.<br /><br />Of course, Kate Blanchett is masterful as Kate Hepburn and Baldwin and Alda are undeniably great as Pan Am President Juan Trippe and Senator Owen Brewster respectively, but it seems that everyone for some reason has overlooked the simply extraordinary job Kate Beckinsale does in her incredibly sultry portrayal of Ava Gardner.  Hats off all around on a fantastic film that truly captures the many faces of the young enigma that was Howard Hughes.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Sorry...this band is a 'poor mans' U2. Why aren't more reviewers up in arms about the blatant \\"ripping off\\" of bands like U2? These same reviewers cut Oasis apart for sounding like the Beatles, but they give Coldplaya \\"free pass\\" on all the stuff anf riffs they steal. Makes no sense. Coldplay puts me to sleep. Sorry.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|There are plenty of prog-metal hounds that are going to expound on the virtues of this album. I'll share a few tiny things that tickled me. (I'm pressed for time. This should by no means be considered all that I found interesting about \\"Octavarium\\") <br /> <br />The first minute  of \\"The Root of All Evil\\". There's some wonderful percussion in there...and great timing between the snare, guitar, and the rests. Fantastic opening. <br /> <br />Sacrificed Sons. People are going to talk about the political/religious lyrics. I love the song for the vocal. He could have been singing about Little Miss Muffet for all I care. LaBrie's vocal is delightfully \\"other side of the looking glass\\" freakish. <br /> <br />Octavarium. Great stuff all the way through it, but at the end of the forth part, LaBrie starts screaming \\"Trapped inside this octavarium\\". (He repeats it 4 times.) And by \\"screaming\\", I don't mean that he's hitting and holding notes you'd expect from opera singers. It's primal. It sounds like he pushed his voice absolutely as far as it can go and this is the damaged aftermath. On top of this, the rhythm of the repeated lines is ever so slightly off...both from what you'd expect to hear, and from one line to the next. That 20-second parcel of the 24-minute track is a wonderfully tactile experience, like scratching an itch you can't reach.
B0008KLVDM|5.0|Lions Gate oudid Sony's own UMD video releases for the Sony PSP. The Terminator 2 added features included Chapter Selection. (I mean really, how hard would that have been to add to Spider-Man 2 or Hellboy?) They also included seperate soundtracks that take advantage on the way you're listening to it - one mixed for the mono system speaker and a Dolby stereo version for headphone listening. Understandably because of the smaller format, there were no extras, but the price is right, unlike certain Buena Vista Home Video releases.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The thin line between imagination and reality, and the use of a cavern to cross the forbidden limits leads us immediately to the same roots of the mythic fact: Once you have decided to break the line watch out for the consequences.<br /><br />Shijiro and her parents are in a happy picnic and suddenly the curiosity will empower them and you will assist to one of the most memorable imagination exercises in decades. The multiple adventures lived by Shijiro will work out as a frame and will show us some little details, but profoundly revealing such as the awful spelling of her parents on pigs when they have not obeyed certain rules of the game inside this weird world.<br /><br />Excellent work, innovative, fresh that reflects a deep artistic commitment. New airs from the East, will convince you the cinema is able to reinvent itself time after time, this is the intrinsic quality of the art, in last instance.<br /><br />A must for all the family, but much more than a simple children story.<br /><br />A journey to the dense brumes of the imagination!
B00097A5HW|3.0|I rushed to buy this album just moments after it went on sale. Sneaked out of work & everything....Very excited to see what poetic genius Shakira had in store after her overly-extended hiatus from her last latin album \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones\\". \\"Fijacion\\" is a good CD; however it is not excellent. Many tracks lack her original depth and soul she used to have on her other latin albums. I personally believe her spanish work is much better than her english. The previous English album was mediocre and im sad to admit this one went on the same path. The first single is fantastic, especially with Alejandro (another amazing songwriter), but \\"La Tortura\\" is the only of it's kind on the album, there no other danceable upbeat latin-flavored tracks on the album. There are some sweet tracks (very lovey-dovey) \\"En tus Pupilas\\" & \\"Obtener un Si\\" both of which are great. The rest of the album's upbeat tracks are the downfall, she apparently experimenting with electronic beats (very depecheshy) which i dont think suits her lyrical style at all. Overall the album is \\"AVERAGE\\" i only like about 5 of the ten songs. (TEN WHAT A RIP OFF). But if your a shakira FAN as i am you must get it, it has it merits. I was hoping \\"Fijacion Vol. 2\\" would have the music to fit the missing pieces to this puzzle, but ive just read that it's the albums English-language counter part (Watch-out!; we all know how oddly shakira lyrics translate) SO sigh im a little let-down, i guess it'll be another 4 years before we get anything close to \\"Adonde Estan Los Ladrones\\" again. :( <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|not as good as the first one but this is an awesome cd. way better than half these crappy new poser bands. doesn't remind me and be yourself are the best songs on the cd. hope you enjoy.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies that I've seen in a long time.  What mother would let a man put a gun to her child's head and then hesitate to kill him when she finally gets the gun in her possession?  I found myself yelling at her to shoot him a million times and I don't even have to tell you what happened next because it was far too predictable.  I was still angry after watching it because I know in real life that nobody could be so stupid.  There are far better suspense thrillers out there to watch and I'm upset that I had wasted my money on this one!
B0000025D0|5.0|Not as upbeat or pop-friendly as \\"Born In The USA\\", \\"Darkness\\" is nevertheless one of the finest things in Bruce Springsteen's catalogue. <br />It is almost like a concept album, ten little story-songs about hope and hard times among working class youth who only have a little and aren't even sure of keeping that. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Badlands\\", \\"The Promised Land\\" and the somber title track are among Springsteen's very best, and \\"Darkness\\" is an unusually strong and varied rock n' roll record. If you only know Springsteen from the radio, or if you're only familiar with his later material, take your buddy Ron's advise and pick up this gritty 1978 album. <br />And don't forget to read the hilarious \\"review\\" by that weirdo who calls himself \\"Ramses the Great\\" either. Man, he must be one bitter and lonely dude, eh? He even has five different usernames so he can vote for his own \\"reviews\\" five times. <br />It's tough when all you have in your life is G. Gordon Liddy's radio show on tape. <br />Head shots! Head shots!
B0006L0LOS|3.0|I truly expected this movie to truly suck.  I went to a bud's house and he had rented it.  I almost left.  I stuck around and was happy to find out that this is a simple fun, very non-plausible flick.  It's a good time.  I like how much more she is actually like a cat than Michele Pheiffer (sp?), but Michele was a MUCH better Catwoman overall.  Again, if you're a comic book buff, avoid this, but if you just want some mindless fun and watching Halle be hot, ck it out.  Watch for the clever way they pay homage to previous Catwomen and see how many you can find.  I hope for a much better sequel.
B00000I4XR|5.0|Jaws is one of those movies that lasts and lasts for a long time!!!!! It is a true classic film that makes you think is it really safe to go back in the water!!!!!! Jaws has it all great story,great cast, great setting, and most of all a true master piece of film!!!!!! Its about a great white shark that attacks a coastal small town and its up to the police chief to take care of this shark problem!!!!! Even though this movie came out before i was born when i got the chance to see this movie it was totally cool and it was different!!!!! This movie does scary me and of course i will not go in the ocean,because of this movie!!!!! If you haven't seen this movie then go rent it now!!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Upon checking my e-mail this morning, I saw that there was a music review for X&Y on MSN. <br />I read, and vommited. <br /> <br />It stated that Coldplay's Chris Martin's lyrics are \\"a veritable laundry list of triteness, complete with 'deep end' metaphors, 'like a puzzle' similes and, of course, a 'ladder up to the sun.'\\" <br /> <br />I will say, first, that levels of \\"triteness\\" vary with each individual, but the individual who wrote the poor review surely has some pride disabilities. <br />Johnny Cash wrote pure and simple lyrics that were worldly understood (Coldplay's \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" was originally to be recorded by Cash until he died-- funny, is it not?). I think, possibly, this other review author has problems with accepting anything other than the most eloquent, scholarly, and intricately detailed lyrics to tickle his/her ears. What must be realized and accepted is that, to grasp attention, words spoken and/or sung by no means must show that a thesaurus and English Handbook were used until the spines were worn. <br />Coldplay's lyrics, though simple, evoke deep thoughts, create beautiful imagery, and leave you destined to sing them to yourself when not listening to them. <br /> <br />The album begins with an exciting and encouraging song, \\"Square One\\" and lyrics like: <br /> <br />\\"The future's for discovering/ <br />The space in which we're travelling\\" <br /> <br />This song epitomizes the perfect beginning song for an album in that it is not too soft to grab attention, nor too loud and fast to disturb and frustrate. <br /> <br />Another song, my particular favorite, \\"Twisted Logic\\" encourages speaking out and standing up for that in which you believe. It also provokes thoughts of the future, which causes us to think of how we are now and how we can improve. <br /> <br />\\"Hundreds of years in the future <br />It could be computers <br />Looking for life on earth <br /> <br />Don't fight for the wrong side <br />Say what you feel like <br />Say how you feel\\" <br /> <br />Enough said. <br /> <br />The author of the review I so nauseatedly read should probably re-think his/her \\"scoring\\" for the newest Coldplay album, because clearly to the rest of us, it soars to new heights with sweeping melodies and thought provoking lyrics. Of course, it also continues to cause YET MORE loving feelings for the talented Chris Martin.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I read some reviews on this cd that \\"its metallica throwing in the towel\\" and crap like that.So not true this is a masterpiece for sure.The orchastra sounds awsome to say the least, and improves alot of songs.It is true that James doesnt have his gruel,but for the most part its fine, but for some some songs like enter sandman arnt that good live.They play alot of songs from load, and not much of there old stuff,which is good because im not a big metal,i just like some metallica,and not much of there old stuff. Anyways, i know that load wasnt that good,but they do amazing versions of it on this.The instramentals are awsome, all the songs from load and reload are much better and the two new songs are pretty good[especally no leaf clover]. <br /> <br /> Ecstasy of gold- Beutiful masterpiece on just the orcastras.10/10 <br /> <br /> ktulu- i love the guitar in this and the orcastra sounds really nice.A great instrumental song that is enjoyable.9/10 <br /> <br /> Master of puppets-Probly the most famous metal song.  <br />It is done great live and is really cool how the crowd sings half of the song. The solos are wicked and the orcastra sounds fine.The one complaint tho is James mummbles to much and its hard to understand what he is saying.But still 10/10. <br /> <br /> Of wolf and men-I hated the version on the black album for a long time, but this version got me liken the song.James does a great job on vocals and the orcastra is really cool at the begining.He also talks to the crowd in this song, which is kind of cool.Anyways great version. 9/10 <br /> <br /> the thing that should not be- I dont kare much for this song. It is ok, just doent draw my attention.7/10 <br /> <br /> Fuel-I really didnt like the original version, i found it boaring.The orcastra really brings it to life and James does a much better job on it.This song is just great live and is a big improvment.10/10 <br /> <br /> Memory remains-THis song is so cool live.I love it when the crowd sings.Yet again the orcastra makes it alot better.The only problem is that James voice is weak in the chorus, other than that it is better than the origanal. <br /> <br /> No leaf clover-A great song.One of the new songs.Its kinda heavy to.I really cant describe how cool this song really is.I think James's voice cracks up and misses afew notes[at the end when he sais \\"then it cones to be\\"]but it sounds so cool when he does for some odd reaon.This is a highlight on this album.10/10. <br /> <br /> Hero of the day-I hate the original version.It sounds as if there trying to make one of those slow songs that everybody loves and terribly failed.But, this is live and they do just about everything better live.I think the orcastra makes a huge difference, and james's singing is alot better on it, but the biggest change is the drums.They start up later and that makes it so so so much better.Its great live and bad on the origanal.10/10 <br /> <br /> devils dance- dont like either version.I dont think it changes much live.4/10 <br /> <br /> Bleeding me-This is a really good song live.Like alot of the load songs, starts of melow and then picks up. Cool beet as well.10/10 <br /> <br /> Nothing else matters-This is by far my favorite metallica song, but its not as good live.The drums dont start up untill verse 2,and James doesnt do that good of a job singing.He mummbles a bit and seems tired. The solo is the worst of the negitives about this song.In the studio version its one of my favorite solos althogh its short. On this it seems just to make noise.Even with all these negitives, it still is a goog song,just could have been better.9/10 <br /> <br /> until it sleeps- This is better then the original version, although the original is still very good.One of the better songs on load and even on live. 10/10 <br /> <br /> For whom the bell tolls-The one actual song from ride the lightnigh, and its great.The bass riff is awsome and the guitar is crazy with that riff.James does a good job on vocals.This song gets me pumped up and is fun the sing.10/10 <br /> <br /> Human- Not as good as the other new one, but still pretty good.The lyrics are really cool, but doesnt have the greatest beet.8.5/10 <br /> <br /> Wherever i may roam-Such a cool song with a really cool intro. I didnt like this version of it at first because i didnt like how James song, but it grew on me and i like  this version more.10/10 <br /> <br /> outlaw torn-Theres something about this song that i love.I think it is a really cool song.I think the original would be really different because you can hear the orcastra alot.Really long song as well, but awsome.10/10 <br /> <br /> sad but true- I dont like this song at all.It it slightly better on this on so i will give it 3/10. <br /> <br /> One-Love both versions.I think i like this one a tad bit more.The guirat and drums are amazing in this.The orcastra makes it sound a bit different,but good. 10/10 <br /> <br /> Entersandman-A classic gone bad.This is one of the songs that is better when he had his growl voice.Its kinda boaring live.6/10 <br /> <br /> Battery-WOW!Like i said before,im not a huge metal fan,especally when its thrash,but theres something about this that makes me sad when its over.This song tears your balls out.Good way to end the concert.10/10 <br /> <br /> So for the most part, the songs are better live and the orcastra is great.Those people saying that this sucks, well there probly the goths that enjoy screamming and dont no what real music is.By the way, im a 14 year old who doesnt have a jod and rarly gets $, but i saved up for about 2 and a half months before i hade enough to by this cd, and it was worth every dollar{almost50 with tax}, so that sais somthing.

0790729393|4.0|I went out and bought this dvd used, for about five dollars. Here are ten - Count `em - (10) observations:<br /><br />1. When the Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup characters confront the Kevin Bacon Character in a Hell's Kitchen tavern near the middle of the story, \\"Sleepers\\" is absolutely electric. This scene is worth the price of the dvd alone. (Would the two hoods have killed the former reformatory guard in this manner? Probably not, but what is shown makes for better theater, and an easier transition.)<br /><br />2. Alas, \\"Sleepers\\" does not continue with the same sort of intensity as the above-mentioned murder scene. The story begins and moves along at an even pace, but once the trial of the Eldard and Crudup characters begins, the story becomes more ambiguous and ends rather abruptly.<br /><br />3. Which brings us to the foundation and integrity of the film: The story appears to be mostly believable up to the above-mentioned murder. After that, it gets pretty dicey.<br /><br />4. Also, the timeline in \\"Sleepers\\" is sort of weird. The characters seem to have been born around 1950 - 1952, but are still preteen kids by 1967 or 1968, which, judging from the background music (\\"Alone Again Or\\" by Love) appears to be when they were sent to the boy's reformatory. By 1981, which is when the killing of the Bacon Character takes place, they are all supposed to be in their mid-twenties.<br /><br />5. A City or County Prosecutor in his mid-twenties, even in New York, is rather rare. Maybe he might have had some type of connection with some alderman or some old Irish Democrat, but if he did, he would never have been sent to the reformatory in the first place. Anyway, Brad Pitt looked like he was about ninteen when this film was made.<br /><br />6. Robert DeNiro played himself with his \\"Regular New York Guy\\" routine, but his character's motives for lying under oath was too contrived. I'm not saying that a priest would be incapable of doing something like this; After all, beside having dedicated their live to the pursuit of spirituality, priests are human beings as well and vulnerable to the same feelings about situations that we all face from time to time. However, under the given circumstances, this sort of \\"feel good\\" ending was slightly unbelievable and too gimmicky.<br /><br />7. The popular music sprinkled throughout the soundtrack really does not fit what was happening visually in the film. I was also surprised to find that the soundtrack CD only contained the background music. \\"Walk Like a Man\\" by the Four Seasons, which was so prominently used in the film, never made it to the soundtrack CD.<br /><br />8. It's hard to believe that so many good actors were assembled for this film. Dustin Hoffman, DeNiro, Minnie Driver, Brad Pitt, Jason Patrick and all the rest of the cast did their part to live up to the billing. This all-star cast was what probably saved \\"Sleepers\\". With lesser actors, one wonders what the final outcome would have been.<br /><br />9. \\"Sleepers\\" is not a bad film, it's just not a great one. This is the sort of thing that happens when you get three or more big box office draws working the same project. The final product appears to be mediocre, because it can't possibly live up to the advance billing.<br /><br />10. I wish Levinson had made more of the tavern murder scene throughout the film, i.e. flashbacks, different camera angles, etc. Eldard and Crudup, along with the direction of this scene are simply amazing. They were right on target with their portrayal of two young hoods.<br /><br />Bonus comment: Why do directors like Levinson persist in trying to portray old Mafia Dons as wise, stoic old men? Most of these guys would just as soon kill you as look at you...fter all, beside having dedicated their live to the pursuit of spirituality, priests are human beings as well and vulnerable to the same feelings about situations that we all face from time to time.

B0006399FS|4.0|It's good, no, it's great, but I think there's something missing, I' ve hear it a lot, and the first times I hear it I was surely disapointed, but is a super grower, even if it has great songs, it surely hasn't provoce me those feelings that songs as in a little while, If god will send his angels, all i want is you and a lot of more u2 songs had make me feel, bue its nice, this is my song by song review: <br /> <br />01.Vertigo - Is the heaviest U2 song ever, and the first single, it's not bad, but it can't be a classic. 8/10 <br /> <br />02.Miracle Drug - One of my favorites in the album, it's just great, I love the part of \\"the songs are in your eyes, I see them when you smile\\". 9/10 <br /> <br />03.Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, This is for Bob (How many times has Bono said it??) It's just a song that makes you sing, is good, but I think it was too elaborated and planned, but it stills great, 9/10 <br /> <br />04.Love And Peace Or Else, hmmmm, I don't know what to say about this song, I like it and I don't, It has one of the best solos I've ever heard from the edge, but I don't know, there's something about it that I don't like. 8/10 <br /> <br />05.City Of Blinding Lights, It's amazing, just amazing, it has a new U2 sound, but it also has those vintage u2 guitars, bono sings great, I love it, 9/10 <br /> <br />06.All Because Of You, It's kind of punk U2 sound, is good, but just good, 8.5/10 <br /> <br />07.A Man And A Woman, Good for the fans, nothing exceptional, 8/10 <br /> <br />08.Crumbs From Your Table, Good and just good too, they made it drunk hahaha, 8.5/10 <br /> <br />09.One Steo Closer, I love it, is sweet and emotional, 9/10 <br /> <br />10.Original Of Species, Great Intro piano, is a great song, but just for the fans, 9/10 <br /> <br />11.Yahweh, Don't know what to say, I don't like very much the cd version, but I heard the live version, which is just The Edge with his acoustic guitar and bono, and I loved that song, I wonder why didn't they made the song Acoustic for the album?? it could be new for u2, and soo great, the song acoustic is amazing, 9/10
B0006L16N8|5.0|Talk about unintended consequences.      Here's an interesting point: The most anticipated release (so far) of 2005 has been met with a cacophony of critical ho hums.  But the content of the reviews from these critics actually encouraged me to rush out to buy the CD.  Here's a melange of critics complaints and my observations:  1) \\"These songs were written with stadiums in mind with thousands of people singing along\\".  Hmmm, so that's a criticism?  My most memorable concert experiences are of a packed house singing along loudly to tunes with great melodies and great choruses.  Should Coldplay have to apologize for making an album that their fans will love? Personally, I can't wait to be there (I have tickets) and sing along with 19,999 others to \\"Fix You\\" - a stirring anthem that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck when you first hear it.  While I'm on my soapbox, I guess we should complain about the Beatles trying to write songs to send teenagers into a frenzy?  Or The Grateful Dead trying to write songs to get stoners to follow them all over the country?  Or the Beach Boys trying to write songs that would be played at summer picnics until infinity?  Give me a break.  2) \\"They are an accidental success trying to overtake U2 as world's biggest rock band\\".  Well, their success is no accident.  Clearly the same critics have forgotten the excellence and universal praise of Coldplay's last release.  U2's latest album was admittedly great but how many more will they have in them?  My guess is zero to one.  There's no other candidates even remotely close to taking the crown from U2.  What do we expect, that Coldplay should be lowering their sights?    3) \\"Pilfering freely from U2, Pink Floyd, The Beatles (to name a few)\\".  In fact, if you were to put the greatest strengths of those three bands in a blender, you would come up with something like \\"Talk\\".  Criticism to some - for me, musical heaven on Earth.      I could go on but why bother.  It's pretty clear that Coldplay have committed the biggest sin you can make in critics' circles:  Being critical darlings and then going on to sell 20 million albums worldwide (Oh, and Chris Martin marrying Gwyneth Paltrow only fanned the flames).  It puts things in perspective knowing that the first albums by Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Beatles (I kid you not), and countless others of the greatest rock artists ever, were trashed by critics when they first came out.    Apart from the songs mentioned above, there's many others that will become part of Coldplay's long term repertoire.   Comparisons to previous albums are moot.  How much did Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" sound like \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  How much did \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" sound like \\"The White Album\\"?  \\"Led Zeppelin II like Led Zeppelin III\\"?  Like many great bands before them, Coldplay have made a new CD that doesn't sound like their previous ones, but it sounds like Coldplay.    My complaints?    The title song \\"X&Y\\" plods a bit. As with at least a few songs on \\"Parachutes\\", it doesn't have you reaching for the skip button, but you won't be hitting the repeat button either.    \\"Twisted Logic\\" is awful. I haven't tried to figure it out lyrically because the music is so dull that I don't care.  But how many CDs (with 13 tracks) have you bought recently where that's true of only one song?      Critics be damned.  I will be holding my Bic lighter high when Coldplay takes the stage in my town on September 10. And I will be singing along loudly with all of the other pilgrims there to see the saviours of rock.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I've heard this album, and, maybe cause I was expecting so much of it I was a little dissapointed with it, but the most I hear it, the most I like the songs, surely is a grower, but, compairing the new albums from the 3 best rock bands right now, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\", \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" and \\"X&Y\\", I think everybody expected more from Coldplay, personally I think Oasis has done an amazing job with Don't Believe The Truth, And I think too that coldplay could make a better record, however, X&Y has 4 or 5 stunning songs, Song by song review: <br /> <br />01.Square One - 8/10, U got to hear it loud, is a good opener, but is hard to make a better opener song than Politik. <br /> <br />02.What If - Is good, it's nice and it has good lyrics and piano, but I think Amsterdam and The Scientist are better, but it's one of the most emotionals tracks of the album. <br /> <br />03.White Shadows, My favorite on the album and one of my favorites from coldplay, amazing song, 10/10 <br /> <br />04.Fix You, everyone's favorite, not my favorite, Chris uses to much his treble-femmale tone, but the song's good, 9/10 <br /> <br />05.Talk, It's early U2, from the guitar to the drums, I love it, 9/10 <br /> <br />06. X&Y - I just don't like it, 6/10. <br /> <br />07.Speed Of Sound - The first single, hmmmm, sometimes I love it, Sometimes I don't like it, it's a kind of combination between clocks and trouble, classic coldplay sound, is good, 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br />08.A Message - One of my favorites, great lyrics, sweet acoustic guitar, 10/10 <br /> <br />09.Low - I don't like it at all, the worst in the album, 5/10 <br /> <br />10.The Hardest Part - I like it, but it gets a little borring, 8/10 <br /> <br />11.Swallowed In The Sea, Another favorite, great song, great lyrics, great vocals. \\"you cut me down a three\\"...could be Chris refering to his little daughter Apple?? 10/10 <br /> <br />12.Twisted Logic, Sounds like a song that no one heards from A Rush of Blood, I can't really said anything about it cause I haven't heard it enough. 8/10 <br /> <br />Till Kingom Come - I don't care if Johny Cash made it, It's the most emotional song of the album and one of coldplay's finest and emotional song, this song is a bomb, 10/10 <br /> <br />Is a good recors, but it could be better if they've cut out Low, Twisted Logic and a few more for B sides <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|This album here is basically a collection of largely listenable and mostly pleasant piano/synth (they actually do use more synth than piano on this release) driven pop songs.  These lushly produced pop songs are mostly passable, but I can't help but notice off the bat that the group uses the same chord progressions in almost every song, resulting in most of the tracks sounding a little too similar.  Most of the songs here are perfectly constructed...a little too perfectly constructed.  The production is almost flawless but the whole thing seems a little contrived.  They seem to be trying a little too hard to define themselves to the world as THE \\"piano driven anthemic rock band\\", and they wind up coming a little too uncomfortably close to sounding like a factory produced, assembly line, non-descript, pointless product (albeit a generally pleasant and mostly listenable product, but a factory produced product nonetheless).  So what about the lyrics you ask?  I often say that for many artists, there is a pretty thin line between profundity and self-indulgent pretentious cheese.  Martin leans a little too heavily toward the latter in my opinion.  And really, I don't even question his sincerity, I just think that he honestly can't help himself.  So for the most part, this album consists of at least adequate, well constructed pop songs that make for a pretty smooth but not at all compelling listen.  So just don't expect too much more than that.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen Phantom of the Opera on stage several times (first time with Michael Crawford) I was very skeptical and reluctant to see it transformed to film.  So much that I did not find time to view when it was in release.  I have just purchased and viewed this production and now wish I had seen it on the large screen.  Although some of the story line has been altered, the changes included actually are from the original book and better explain the ending of the story.  I found it very entertaining and would recommend it to anyone.
B00097A5HW|4.0|Let's face it. For many longtime Shakira fans, her English-language debut, Laundry Service, was a big disappointment. From the uncharacteristic awkwardness of many of the lyrics to the over-the-top cringe-inducing bombast of the production, this was not the Shakira we had come to know through her earlier albums. The confident, independent, challenging and unique artist who had been referred to as the \\"Latin Alanis Morissette\\" was now being lumped in with the likes of Britney Spears by fans and critics, and marketed on the basis of her newly faux-blonde good looks instead of her estimable musical talent. <br />The good news is that, with Fijacion Oral Vol. 1, Shakira has returned to the territory she staked out with her powerhouse 1999 release, Donde Estan los Ladrones? <br />One senses from the first look at the CD's cover photo that this album does not simply pick up where Laundry Service left off. The blonde locks are still there, but the picture of Shakira cradling a baby, whose chubby hands grasp at the international mega-star's necklace as she sits serenely in flat white light, has a depth that speaks of much more than the previous album's one-dimensionally sexy over-the-shoulder glance possibly could. And of course, the baby girl is positioned as if to breastfeed -- the play on the album's title being obvious, and typical of Shakira's sometimes-provocative way with words and sense of humour. <br />What about the music? Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 is enough to make fans of Shakira's pre-Laundry Service work stand up and cheer. Her voice is in amazing form, leaping, twisting and bending sinuously around some of the most beautiful melodies she's written yet. <br />The album covers a wide range of musical styles (with more electronica than we've heard from Shakira before), yet hangs together tightly as a solid whole. The lead single, La Tortura, is probably the album's least inventive track, but the contributions of Spanish star Alejandro Sanz on vocals and tres help lift the song to a higher level. <br />Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 takes the listener on a journey from French-style pop (En tus pupillas) through cool 1960s bossa nova (Obtener un si), rock en espaol (Escondite ingles) and Latin pop (No) to sounds that are uniquely Shakira (Dia especial, La pared, Dia de enero). These are the songs that bring the listener back to Donde Estan los Ladrones?, since several of them would sound at home on that landmark album. <br />Welcome back, Shakira -- it's been a long wait, but well worth it!
0767803434|4.0|Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass, it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford's career, and as we flip through the years it seems to me he hasn't had a bona fide hit since 1997.  (2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.)  Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another.  K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER?  Dead in the water.  HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE?  Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves.  RANDOM HEARTS?  When you look up \\"catastrophe\\" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie.  SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS?  Awful.  WATER TO WINE (2004)?  Even his fans don't know what it is!  I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC.<br /><br />So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97.  The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time.  Reactionary?  No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit \\"24,\\" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE.  And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs.<br /><br />Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now.  He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close.<br /><br />AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.  I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career.  Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL.  The rest is film history.way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close. <br /> <br />AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt.

B00080Z53O|5.0|Presenting a topic as controversial as the one touched upon in this movie is not an easy task, but director Alejandro Amenabar has succeeded in achieving a balanced and humane approach at the issue of the right to die with dignity. In my opinion, the director could not have done this without the magnificent performance of Javier Bardem, who transmits the feelings and opinions of Ramon Sampedro with such conviction and clarity that one cannot help but feel touched by the story and the issue at hand.<br /><br />Ramon is a quadriplegic that wants to die because he claims that living this way has no dignity. He has been prostrated in his bed for the last twenty-six years of his life after hitting the bottom of the sea and breaking his neck. The issue is not a simple one, because Ramon has a loving family and his mind works perfectly, so a lot of people in that situation, me included, would probably hold on to life. But the distinction is relevant here, since Ramon does not argue that everyone in his situation should die or desire to do so, but rather that he wants to do it, and should be allowed to. Basically, he wants to decide how to live and how to die without other people's opinions being a factor.<br /><br />In order to achieve his wishes, Ramon is consulting with a lawyer (Julia) to get approval from the courts. But Ramon has to battle other people beside the courts, like his brother, who cannot comprehend why Ramon is insisting on dying. As the process towards the trial begins, Ramon becomes news on TV. That is how Rosa, a local neighbor, finds out about him and decides to try to infuse him with a desire to live. Ramon's relationship with Julia and with Rosa is a central part of this movie and helps understand better his wishes and how difficult his decision is.<br /><br />This is a highly emotional movie that touches on complex issues and uses powerful statements on both sides, so there are no easy answers. In my case, one of the statements that left me thinking for the longest time was when Ramon said \\"The person who actually loves me will be precisely the one who helps me die\\". But I guess that different people will react in different ways and reach different conclusions, the important point is that the film will make you think and consider both sides of the argument. Now you just need to get ready for an emotional upheaval and plunge into the sea with the wonderful Javier Bardem.hinking for the longest time was when Ramon said \\"The person who actually loves me will be precisely the one who helps me die\\".

B00000DCHE|5.0|This CD is simply incredible. There is not a weak song on it. I really got it for several for several songs, such as \\"Captain Jack\\", and fell in love with the entire CD. Miami 2017 really makes you remember 9/11, and \\"Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" is a particular favorite of mine as well. This is one of the best live CDs ever, right up there with The Who's \\"Live At Leeds\\", and Pink Floyd's \\"Pulse\\". And the CD cover is excellent, right up there with \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and Led Zeppelin 1, as covers you will not forget. This is a must have CD, I cannot praise it enough. <br />
0812550757|5.0|After I finished with \\"Ender's Game\\" I read an interview with Orson Scott Card in which the author said that the only reason for expanding the first book in the series from a novella to a novel was to provide a more solid foundation to the real story he wanted to tell. Having loved the first book in the series I could not wait to get my hands on \\"Speaker for the Death\\" based on that \\"recommendation\\", and luckily I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />More than three-thousand years have passed since Ender annihilated the buggers without knowing what he was actually doing, and we find a world that shocks us in our core, since Ender is seen as a murderer of masses. On the other hand, most people venerate the Speaker for the Dead, unaware that this person is none other than that who they despise: Ender Wiggin. But even if for most people he is just an evil guy that lived three millenniums ago, we find him alive thanks to the intricacies of intergalactic travel. Ender is only thirty-eight years old and spends his time trying to find a world in which to provide the buggers with a new beginning; using the cocoon he has, which contains a new queen of the buggers.<br /><br />Those that read \\"Ender's Game\\" probably liked the fast pace of the book and the way in which the author engages the reader with the games and the battles. That book also contained ethical aspects that affected the story, but these were hinted at and not discussed too deeply. I was expecting something similar, but found that there was a surprise in store for me, with a book that is not fast-paced at all, but instead reads more like a reflection on philosophical and ethical issues. This does not sound as much fun, but let me tell you, the author surrounds these main topics with such fascinating events that the journey is a real treat. The final result was that I loved this book, and now even prefer it over the first installment.<br /><br />The story is set in Lusitania (in allusion to Portugal), a planet in which the human race cohabitates with the pequeninos (little ones in Portuguese). Here we find Pipo, a xenobiologist that is in charge of studying the behavior of the pequeninos, also called piggies, while interfering as little as possible. He is assisted in this task by his son Libo and an orphan called Novinha. When everything seems to be moving forward as planned and Libo and Novinha start to build a relationship that goes beyond friendship, Pipo ends up murdered by the piggies. Novinha knows that the reason behind this has to do with findings from the research she showed the man right before his demise, but does not know exactly what. As a she is disoriented and decides to summon a Speaker for the Dead to speak Pipo's death and bring closure to this incident. The speaker that is closest to the planet is none other than Ender, who now gets a new opportunity to interact with another alien race and who believes that the planet may be a good environment for bringing the buggers back to life.

Here we find Pipo, a xenobiologist that is in charge of studying the behavior of the pequeninos, also called piggies, while interfering as little as possible. He is assisted in this task by his son Libo and an orphan called Novinha. When everything seems to be moving forward as planned and Libo and Novinha start to build a relationship that goes beyond friendship, Pipo ends up murdered by the piggies. Novinha knows that the reason behind this has to do with findings from the research she showed the man right before his demise, but does not know exactly what. As a she is disoriented and decides to summon a Speaker for the Dead to speak Pipo's death and bring closure to this incident. The speaker that is closest to the planet is none other than Ender, who now gets a new opportunity to interact with another alien race and who believes that the planet may be a good environment for bringing the buggers back to life.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|I was watching Oldboy with my girlfriend and by the end I was totally amazed. She was in tears and telling me how much she suffered through the whole thing, specially the face to face scene between Oh Daesu and his captor. For mankind's sake, this scene alone will drain your heart and your body strenght so much you'll end up tired and beaten, a lot like the main character.<br /><br />The movie is really violent, but not in a gory way -there is some gore, indeed- but in a human perspective, the kind that makes you wonder about how low you would get if you were to suffer through the most terrible nightmare. A moment so long and so horrible that once you wake up to reality you've become a terrible monster. Something so powerful pain is nothing but a four letter word to you.<br /><br />You may solve the ending by the middle of the film, but once you get there you can rest assured you're not prepared to get the full punch of it's outcome.<br /><br />If you're to see one movie in 2005, this may be it.

0060752610|5.0|When Warren Buffett says that this book is by far the best book ever written on investing one has to take notice.  While \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" exists in print in several editions, (4th rev edition 0060155477, 2003 rev edition w/ Jason Zweig 0060555661, and some audio book versions), this is a reprint of the original 1949 edition and has several virtues.<br /><br />It is the original statement of what has come to be called Value Investing.  This is a very philosophical book more than a book of techniques or methods of investing.  Mr. Graham writes firmly and clearly about where the Investor's interests really lie.  He is very hard on brokers, whose profession he considered more of a semi-profession because they have their own interests at heart more than those of their client.  He also makes a strong case of about the kinds of returns one can expect from the market versus a company one actively manages.  If investors of the 1990s had headed his views on management and their interests not being aligned with those of shareholders a lot less money would have been lost.<br /><br />In several places he states that shareholders need to act more like owners and should not simply submit to management or let them have free reign with the resources of the company.  He also advocated the importance of an independent board of directors rather than a board of management cronies.  He rejects the notion of simply selling shares if you don't like the way the company is being managed.  That is a dereliction of their duty as owners.<br /><br />There is also a discussion of a variety of approaches to investing and he contrasts defensive investing or investing using analysis versus speculating.  Like Buffett, Graham views investment as a buy and hold for the long term with active influence on the way the company is run.  In his view, frequent trading is the road to losses.  But at least you make capital gains possible for others.<br /><br />Obviously, much of the specific information about companies, stock performance, taxes, US Savings Bonds, and such have to be adjusted for.  We are more than fifty years later and much has changed.  However, the core philosophy of the book is solid, readable, and profound.<br /><br />The foreword provided in this reprint is by John C.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|THe musicianship on this album is tight.  Guitars, bass and drums are all top notch.  The only thing holding this album back are cheesy lyrics/artwork and irritating singing.  The singer fluctuates on certain words far too much. For example if the word \\"now\\" appears in a song the singer will sing it \\"NOW EE OW\\".  Listen to the opening lines of Bat COuntry to hear what i mean.  It's annoying.  If Amazon allowed half stars i'd have given it 3 1/2 for musicianship.   <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|While this does make their sound almost as epic as it can get it isn't as distinctive song to song as their last album and so it doesn't stick as well, but their talent for effectively putting you into a mood is on the job full time here.  What a lot of people seem to dislike about Coldplay is the fact they don't rock and that their music isn't about deeper human struggles outside of romantic hardship.  In effect, the public scrutinized them for not being the savior of the world with their music, like U2 although they advocate the same causes as U2 and have a song on their last album about their striving for fair trade.  Whatever the case may be, no one can touch Coldplay because they don't have to rock, write better songs than the overintrospective hodgpodge of singer-songwriters who use hot button issues seemingly as a diversion from the monotony of \\"I wish I had a better life cause all I have is this bottle\\" songs.  Coldplay is a band that although their sound and outlook are limited, are still more compelling than many of the most diverse stylistic music out because it's a compelling vision and it doesn't matter if people feel it's inaccurate, or shallow.  The way I look at it is that Coldplay have their style down so well it's like their music is through a lens, or filter, and seen or heard through these, it's good, but when seen or heard through others, it's just monotonous, boring, self-important, whiny music by a bunch of people who've tasted such success that they shouldn't be that sad.  That's not a perspective that I share.  By the way, my favorite songs on this are White Shadows and Fix You, but it's all pretty good.  I'll let you listen and decide for yourself. <br />Later

B00008CLOA|5.0|I bought this off Amazon in spite of the negative reviews. I have this recording in its many incarnations including the \\"Harvest\\" CD and Quad LP, as well as the 8 Track tape, and stereo LP. I think this is the clearest sounding version to date. I was all prepared to \\"dis\\" the new version as many previous reviewers did. Imagine my chagrin when I proved to myself once and for all pre-concieved notions are not to be trusted.  <br />   My equipment is a Pioneer four channel circa 1973 that I bought while stationed in S.E. Asia back then. The CD player is of course of more recent vintage. So maybe the newer equipment lays bare any flaws? I don't know. But it sounds very good, extremely clear, and it is Pink Floyd. What more can you ask for.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|The Machinist tells the tale of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), who has been suffering from insomnia for the last year, as well as not being able to eat very much.  To say that he is \\"thin\\" is an understatement.  Even when you're prepared for it, it's still shocking.   <br /> <br />Trevor works a blue collar job as a machinist.  He's the kind of guy who knows all the rules and regulations and everyone is a little annoyed with him for that.  Things are going okay until he causes an accident at work that leaves one of his colleagues without an arm.   <br /> <br />At this point, Trevor meets a mysterious character named Ivan, another worker at the plant, who nobody else seems to have met or even seen.  Is Trevor just hallucinating from his lack of sleep?  Or is there a consipiracy among everyone to try to mess with his head?  Trevor suspects (not unreasonably) that the other workers want to get rid of him due to his moment of negligence.  Could they be lying about not knowing Ivan?   <br /> <br />The film does a good job of leaving clues for Trevor and the audience to figure out.  Little Post-It notes show up on Trevor's refrigerator, the most mysterious of which is a game of \\"hangman\\" with six letters.  Solving this puzzle is a big part of finding out what's going on.   <br /> <br />Beneath Trevor's desire to find out about Ivan is the \\"big question\\" of why Trevor can't sleep or eat, and Ivan seems to be a key to finding that out as well.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a pretty well-made suspense thriller.  It loses steam at parts, mainly because when the audience suspects that Trevor is, beyound a doubt crazy, we don't identify with him as much as when we believe he could be right.  Still, the original screenplay, combined with good directing make this a great film to look at.  And the reveal at the end, which answers most of the film's questions, is genuinely surprising and satisfying.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Different, the same, fresh, familiar... <br /> <br />you'll love this record... perhaps not as much as their past albums, but it is great none the less!
0062515675|2.0|This book is a copy of the classic \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\"? The classic book, by the Yogi himeslef (By Paramahansa Yogananda) gives a very good description of the control of the thoughts, and some clear guidelines and the importance of living for the present moment. I would rather read the classic many times than this How-to cook book. <br />
B0000C7PSW|3.0|I found this album somewhat a challenge to listen to. It lacks a cohesion that was absolutely wonderful on \\"Poses\\". It's a concept album? An opera? I suppose. It is well recorded and I do like it, but it requires patience to really take ahold of you. I became familiar with RW from Poses, one of my favorite cds and I was really amped for this subsequent release. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I guess I expected more of the pop genius similar to what I heard before. Having just recently revisited this I am coming to appreciate the originality found here. \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\" - brilliant.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Finally, Shakira has returned to her roots,and given us an album in Spanish. This whole album is a wonderful piece of work. One would think that resorting in working on duets might reduce the orginallity of the album, but in the contrary, it adds flavor to Shakria's wonderful mix of love, pain, and happiness. This is definetly a great album wich will allow you to feel all these emotions and deal with your inner turmoil. I strongly recommend it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X & Y is an awesome follow up to their first two albums.  It is very different from the acoustic Parachutes and more driving Rush of Blood to the Head.  X&Y is more electronic with synthesizers and just incredible.  The first eight songs are all gems.  \\"Fix You\\" I think is the best song Coldplay has come out with and just completely applies to my life.  I know some of Chris Martin's lyrics aren't the most genius, but taken with the context of the music, there simplicity is simply inspirational.  \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" the hidden track is just awesome and Johnny Cash deserves credit for a great song as well as a great redention of it by Coldplay.  This CD really is a must buy.  It is the band's best.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I liked some of Coldplay's earlier stuff.  And I believed the hype about this CD.  Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br />If you do not like rock and roll, this is the CD for you.  If you think even brit-pop ought to have at least some rock to it (e.g., Oasis), steer clear of this pablum.  This CD and rock and roll mix about as well as oil and water. <br /> <br /> It is boring and self-indulgent.  Lyrically, it is about as risky and inventive as a 5th grader's clumsy attempt at poetry.  In fact, the lyrics, with their incessant rhyming and sorry efforts at being clever, are probably closer to something the band Barenaked Ladies would come up with if they were on morphine than anything in the brit-pop world, save, possibly, for The Smiths. Musicically, it is completely, 100% derivative of artists like Kate Bush (especially on Speed of Sound), Oasis, and even The Beatles, but filtered through some sort of effect that sucks the soul out of every single song.  It drones on and on like a wounded animal, except when it yelps with the sound of Chris Martin's grating falsetto.  <br /> <br />There is not a single original thought (I mean, really, listen to some of the inane lyrics), chord progression or melody on this junk. Given its sales figures, it is clear we are a nation of suckers. I'm trading this in for a classic from Kate Bush or The Smiths.
6304712936|5.0|I first watched this movie in grade 9 music class, which was probably 1992. The movie bored me to tears. Being a teenager, who would wanna watch a boring movie about people in weird george washington wigs, playing harpsichords and writing operas? <br /> <br />Well for some reason I was in a video store a number of years later and decided to pick it back up and watch it. Well needless to say I was surprised to say the least. This movie made a heck of a lot more sense the second time around, and the fact that I was older helped a bit also. I personally hate movies that are time pieces. I've only seen a fine few that I liked such as Of Mice And Men, and Anna and the King. Anyway, this movie was really interesting to a musician, which I still dabble in. <br /> <br />I found Mozart funny in this movie, the way he would laugh and all that was funny. But the most interesting part was how brilliant he was at composing. The part that springs to mind is when he's lying in his bed sick, and F. Murray Abraham was there with him and he was composing a whole opera from the top of his head. Now that is brilliant. <br /> <br />If you like classical music, or are just in love with music and want to see where the music of today came from then watch this movie, but I warn you, it might take more than one viewing to find this movie interesting. And kids will not like this movie, it's more for adults. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love this boxset!  I love how they have made it so much better than the originals, not only by digitally mastering it, but also adding in a few things here and there. Especially the ending of return of the jedi  :)   This was a gift for my husbands birthday.  He wasn't expecting this and it was shipped in a very timely fashion.

B0006L16N8|2.0|The lyrics, utterly trite, make me embarrassed to be a Coldplay fan.  And why o why have they traded in a piano for a cheesy synthesizer?   <br /> <br />What amazed me about \\"Parachutes\\" was the sheer restraint of it.  It was subtle and nearly perfect from start to finish.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was good too; although more direct and louder, gorgeous melodies were still abundant.  (The song \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\" was atrocious, and hinted at the lyrical disasters to come).     <br /> <br />X&Y sounds different and worse, combining some cheesy drumbeats, synth sounds, and lyrics with deteriorating songwriting.  There are a few nice moments here, but I want to sing along again.
B00005JMYI|3.0|\\"Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\\" may be an \\"Adam McKay film,\\" but this is Will Farrell's beast from start to finish.  Arguably the best performer ever on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" Farrell has made a career out of bringing hilariously ridiculous characters alive.  Ron Burgundy is another such creation. <br /> <br />Set in the 1970's, in an America on the cusp of new \\"fads\\" like feminism, jogging, and environmental awareness, \\"Anchorman\\" charts the fall and redemption of Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top anchorman.  As the title character, Farrell brings his unique brand of hilarious sincerity to one of his most befuddled characters.  Ask yourself -- could any actor bring more to the line, \\"San Diego, as everyone knows, was founded by Germans in 1904\\"?  If you love Will Farrell, you are sure to like, and quite possibly love \\"Anchorman.\\"   <br /> <br />Burgundy and his \\"crack news team,\\" which includes Paul Rudd as the horny roving reporter Brian Fontana and Steve Carell (\\"The Office\\") as weatherman Brick Tamland -- and Carell plumbs the depths of how low the bar is set for weathermen in San Diego, rule San Diego's TV screens.  But trouble hits paradise when Burgundy's boss Ed Harkin (played by the always perfect Fred Willard -- although he's given surprisingly little to do) is instructed by \\"corporate\\" to bring on . . . gasp! . . . a woman!  Yes, feminism hits the newsroom in the beautiful form of Ms. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, proving that she is worthy of overcoming her \\"Married With Children\\" legacy).  Can Burgundy and his pals tolerate this desecration of the male bastion that is the newsroom?  How can Burgundy reconcile his professional pride with his raging lust for the delectable Ms. Corningstone?  Can Burgundy woo the resisting Ms. Corningstone with his fiery jazz flute performance?  Of such false drama is hilarious comedy made.   <br /> <br />One can easily imagine Will Farrell and his buddies cranking this movie idea out over a long weekend of beer and pizza.  Many of the jokes are indeed inspired.  Look for some hilarious references to \\"West Side Story\\" as the news teams from different networks get together to \\"rumble.\\"  Vince Vaughan leads the second-tier news team with comic timing that proves that \\"Swingers\\" was no fluke.  (From this insanely funny idea we get wonderful cameos from Luke Wilson as the anchor from the third-tier newsroom, from Tim Robbins as the anchor from PBS (of course), and from Ben Stiller as the anchor from the Spanish newschannel.  Genius!)  Who else could conjure up a cologne named \\"Sex Panther\\" that \\"smells like pure gasoline\\"?  Who else could dream up a beloved pooch who wears a head-gear retainer to bed and speaks with bears?  The comic talent at work here is dazzling (look for another inspired cameo from Jack Black, by the way).   <br /> <br />Still, at the end of the day, \\"Anchorman\\" leaves one unsatisfied.  Perhaps its because the movie is so darn short -- even the \\"uncut, unrated\\" version clocks in at barely over 90 minutes, and that's with filler.  True, a lean, mean comedy is better than a bloated gasbag, but this movie is so lean that it borders on emaciated.  Or perhaps it's because the cast of the movie is so darn good that the expectations can't be met.  Whatever the reason, \\"Anchorman\\" does not rise to the level of beloved comedies.   <br /> <br />Full disclosure -- I was on the floor laughing when Vince Vaughan's character was introduced as \\"Wes Mantooth,\\" which is the name of one of my best childhood friends.  To hear that name attached to that character had me in stitches.   <br /> <br />Another point -- this is the \\"unrated uncut\\" version of the movie, but unlike so many other comedies, \\"unrated and uncut\\" does not translate into \\"more T&A.\\"  I am not a prude by any means, but too many \\"comedies\\" use nudity to cover up the fact that the movie just ain't that funny.  \\"Anchorman\\" is refreshingly nudity-free, choosing to go for real laughs rather than blatanttitilation.  The language, while coarse, also generally refrains from profanity, with one funny exception. <br /> <br />Check out \\"Anchorman\\" for some huge, if isolated laughs.  I cannot say this is a \\"must for the film library,\\" but you should definitely see it.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|I discovered this group the same way that a lot of other people did - thru the bonus features on Alone In the Dark, which wasn't the greatest movie, but it was fun to watch.  As I was watching the video I couldn't help but think of hard 80's metal and Judas Priest, but something still intrigue'd me about this band.  I went to check out some more stuff on them and OMG, this is some of the best stuff I've heard in awhile.  I've always been trying to find symphonic rock, but most ppl don't get it right.  The best luck I've had is a group called Pig.  I am becoming a fan of Nightwish.  If you are looking for something different, over-the-top(but in a good way), something that will just put imagery in your head, then get this and the others.  The only complaint's I have is that while their music is just awesome and I'm sure they intended for this: it just sounds muddy.  All the high frequencies on everything have been cut out.  I don't know if this is because there is SO MUCH going on in their songs or what, but it sounds a little amateur, but trust me these guys aren't.  That's the ONLY reason I gave it four stars and not five.  Maybe in the future we can look for \\"ReMastered\\" greatest hits album?  Oh and the bass player needs to sing more, his voice is awesome on Phantom of the Opera and especially Wish I had an angel.
B00006M183|2.0|Pearl Jam are the best band I have ever heard. They just might always be the band I look back as the one with the most number of legendary tracks. Their music reminds me of the ocean and the unpredictable waves.Oceans symbolises change for me.With Riot Act,there came a change too.<br /><br />Besides two tracks on this album , this album was a waste of ears really. \\"You Are\\" stands as solid as anything I heard the year Riot Act came out. Again, it reminds me of this single light tower on a remote island. It's a solid song which any Pearl Jam fan would tell you kicks major \\"a..\\"<br /><br />I liked \\"love boat captain\\" too.<br /><br />Besides the two mentioned songs I couldnt find anything in this album that was of remote interest to me. It was a major let down ,really. After checking a few tracks online, I decided it wasn't worth being purchased.<br /><br />I await the day Pearl Jam rise again.Until then I'll keep myself interested by the two favourite albums by them that I totally dig. \\"Yield\\" and the almighty \\"Viatology\\"<br /><br />If your looking to buy this album,PLEASE NOTE, it lacks enthusiasm and direction with respect to creativity.IT doesnt remotely interest me. I'd much rather suggest you try Incubus or some other of the new fresher bands.<br /><br />Hail Vedder...<br /><br />HSA
B0006L16N8|4.0|I would have to say that this CD is definitely not as good as \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" Still it manages still keep to its soft original music they have been producing. The three best tracks on the CD IMO are \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" being my most favorite, then \\"Speed of Sound\\" and then \\"X&Y\\". Overall tracks 2-7 and track 11 are all good. Tracks 12 and 13 to me are just fillers and really are B-side tracks. If you have liked coldplay before then you will surely like this. The lyrics on this CD aren't as romantic like they were in there last CD. To me this CD took time to grow on me and now I like it quite a bit.
0898705525|4.0|A great book. Very quotable and full of refreshing perspectives on just about everything you could imagine pertaining to relevant thought. My only criticism of it is that, if you approach it as a defense of Christianity, it's not very logically coherent. I sometimes found the logic of his conclusions would get unintelligably tangled in his extraordinary wit as he attempted to express how he arrived at his belief. It approaches it from a witty, emotional and intelligent perspective; but, if your looking for something logically sound, I actually prefer C.S. Lewis or Ravi Zachariah, both of which were significantly influenced by Chesterton. But over all, it was a very enjoyable and profitable read that really helps expand the perspective by which you observe the wonder and majesty of the world of thought which we often take for granted. All in all, I enjoyed it very much.
B0006L16N8|2.0|If you liked Rush of Blood, you'll probably enjoy this. However, it would be nice to see the biggest band in the world right now take advantage of it and make somethng besides a carbon copy of their breakthrough album. <br /> <br />If you want more of the \\"Coldplay sound\\", this album is for you. If you want something sonically and lyrically challenging, you'd be better served to look elsewhere. <br /> <br />One last thing on the lyrics. While some of them are decent, several of the songs are \\"laundry lists of cliches\\", to quote another reviewer. The verses to \\"Fix You\\", for examples, are so cliched and saccharine that they could give you a sugar high.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I find these reviews amusing.  People judging based on a CD they've listened to for about an hour-and-a-half.  I purposely waited a week before reviewing, and I'm glad I did.  At first, I thought this was a poor follow-up to Rush of Blood.  However, after bcoming more familiar with the songs, I now like it just as much as Parachutes and Rush. <br />I would not rate any of the songs as \\"filler\\" like you get with a lot of bands.  What other group can give you a CD with 13 winners?  Most singers/groups can give 3-4 decent songs per CD, then rush it to market to get paid.  Coldplay was patient and it has paid off. <br />It deserves a thoughtful listen.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Okay, when i first bought this cd i would have given it a 3 1/2 cuz, it wasn't like spectacular, but it was fairly good. however i got fed up with in a week. the songs are boring. there's not any depth in them. they lyrics don't have depth, and the songs try to be to catchy. it doesn't work. Unless you just love Simple Plan to death, don't buy this.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Wow. I dig this CD more everytime I listen to it. Sound familiar? That's because that's how ALL Dream theater albums are! This band's been around since the 80's and it's no big shocker that some of their stuff doesn't go down well the first time. But you stick with it and and fast forward to the good parts and before you know it you're listening to the whole thing from beginning to end. This band's music is like an exercise in opening your mind. There seems to be some naysayers out there but I think they just need to give the album a few more spins before they come around.  <br /> <br />Just one more welcome addition from one of the coolest bands in the world.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana Krall is on magnificent form here, please have no fears.<br /><br />The critic who thinks this hovers close to \\"bubblegum pop\\" is raving.  Britney Spears is not going to lose any sales to Diana Krall with this album, or any other.  So why would he want to hurt D.K.'s sales to jazz fans by trashing \\"The Girl In The Other Room?\\"  Some kind of sexual jealousy, perhaps?<br /><br />It is surprising how narrowminded and possessive critics can be.  They will tell you how they love Diana Krall, but will give this wonderful album 2 stars because it isn't what they expected.  Like she somehow betrayed their trust by not consulting them before marrying Elvis Costello and -- even worse -- by singing his compositions.<br /><br />But artists don't belong to anyone except themselves.  Ms Krall is a dazzling young talent evolving in all directions.  It is a privilege to hear this exciting, thoughtful, intelligent, immensely enjoyable jazz album.  As always, she has the capacity to make her studio recordings sound as spontaneous and intimate as her live ones.<br /><br />Easily gets 5 stars.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|What do people find so appealing about this music?  Its loud, noisy, irratating and whiny.  Every song sounds exactly the same--whispery vocals that explode into raging screams, \\"chunk-a-chunk-chunk\\" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.  All she sings about are boys, how much she hates her life, and \\"the pain inside\\".  Who wants to listen to that?  Music is supposed to be entertaining.  How can you be entertained by an entire album full of songs about \\"the pain inside\\"?  There's nothing entertaining about hearing someone whine about how hard their life is.   <br /> <br />And thats all she sings about.  Every song is bitter, hateful, and completely miserable.  How anybody could enjoy something this negative just makes no sense to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Deloused In The Comatorium was a great debut.  I really didn't think that it was a work of genius (as many claimed) but I'm pretty sure that Frances The Mute is.<br /><br />I disagree with a lot of the reviwers here; of the 2 Mars Volta albums, I think this one is far more evolved and rich.  It is truly an avant-garde work and we all know how rare that is these days.  What was promised in the first album has been delivered in spades here.<br /><br />FTM is wildly beautiful and strange and I don't think that any comparisons do it justice -- there just hasn't ever been a rock album like it.  In order to explore the musical ideas fully, the tracks are arranged as a collection of suites, explosive, chilling, thrilling and elegaic by turns.  What's more, it is never pretentious or dull, as the first album sometimes tended to be.<br /><br />If you want to experience jaw-dropping musical vistas, try this weird and wonderful extended fantasy.
B000000OAH|5.0|i love this album, 'jazz,' ends the 70's with a solid effort, not as good as 'a night at the opera,' but still a fantastic album.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I remember watching this movie when it originally aired on television in the late eighties, and I fell instantly in love with it. Many years and many, many viewings later, it remains very dear to my heart. So superbly acted that when I see any of the actors in another movie, I still think of them as their character from \\"Lonesome Dove\\". Being from Texas, and talking the way they talk in the movie, it is a family favorite for quoting. It is a long movie, but worth every minute!
B0000630BT|1.0|this is one of priests worst albums, nightcrawler is only good for 12 year old kids, leather rebel is horrible. for a good priest album buy 'sad wings of destiny.'
B0007P3582|1.0|this album proves that mainstream culture has a low iq supporting garbage like this, i don't need to get into detail why this album is awful, it really does speak for itself. if you want to listen a good rap album check out the new Common CD, thank you.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|better than the ripper albums, but nothing special, for a great priest album buy 'stained class.'
B00005RFVL|5.0|Ever since \\"Millenium\\" was released, I've been a fan of Robbie Williams.  Why he hasn't become a major star in the U.S. is a mystery - perhaps he's too complex to be easily packaged.  Indeed, Robbie shows how multi-faceted he is with \\"Swing When You're Winning,\\" a primo collection of American standards.  Robbie's voice has always been solid, but he really gets to show off his range here.  Although he doesn't have the phrasing of a Sinatra or a Tony Bennett, his personality more than fills any gaps.<br /><br />Aside from Robbie's voice and charm, the record is really held together by the extraordinary instrumentation.  A number of other contemporary artists have tackled the great American songbook, but they have usually opted for updated backing that ends up sounding far too glossy and vapid.  In contrast, most of the songs have instrumental tracks that are similar to what you might hear on a Sinatra record, often supplied by the London Session Orchestra.<br /><br />I was first attracted to this CD by the duet between Robbie and Nicole Kidman on \\"Somethin' Stupid.\\"  Of course, the song was originally recorded by Frank and Nancy Sinatra (#1 in 1967).  Robbie and Nicole sound really good together - voices intertwining sexily; their version went to #1 for 3 weeks in the U.K.  A number of other songs feature guest vocals, mostly from British stars.  \\"Things,\\" a duet with British star Jane Horrocks (\\"Little Voice\\"), is another highlight.  Originally made a hit by Bobby Darin (#3 in 1962), the song really sparkles with lively interplay between Robbie and Jane.  The two sang together previously on one of Horrock's CDs, and the chemistry is plain to see.<br /><br />Other duet partners include Rupert Everett (\\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\"), Jon Lovitz (\\"Well, Did You Evah\\"), Jonathan Wilkes (\\"Me and My Shadow\\"), and Frank Sinatra (\\"It Was a Very Good Year\\").  I don't know who Wilkes is, but the two have some playful banter at the end of the song and sound quite well paired together.  The duet with Sinatra, whereby Robbie's vocals are grafted onto the original version, is fine; however, I would have preferred to hear Robbie's solo version, as I'm not a fan of duets with deceased artists.<br /><br />In addition, Robbie scores on his solo tracks.  One surprise is the somewhat cheesy \\"Mr. Bojangles,\\" to which Robbie very effectively brings some hipness as well as sadness.  In addition to \\"Things,\\" Robbie covers two other songs associated with Bobby Darin - \\"Mack the Knife\\" and \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" and they're both good fun.  The collection only features one original song, but it's a doozy - \\"I Will Talk and Hollywood Will Listen.\\"  The song is told from the point of view of a Hollywood wanna-be who has big dreams of success.  It's a really fantastic song, co-written by Robbie and Guy Chambers, that sounds right at home with the classics, despite its contemporary name-dropping (Cameron Diaz, Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />Finally, the liner notes are excellent, with details on all players for each song.  Robbie also includes fun comments about each songs.  I didn't have very high expectations for this CD, but Robbie really surprises.  \\"Swing When You're Winning\\" is top-notch and really does swing.  Most highly recommended.well paired together.

B000000OA6|5.0|i have to say, the last reviewer is a bit lost, songs like 'these are the days,' and 'slightly mad,' is what makes this album so amazing to queen fans, their ability to go from rock (headlong) to pop (i can't live with you) to ballads (these are the days) is what makes this band special, other bands like the 'the ramones,' and countless other bands could never dream of doing.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I love DT but I find this recording disappointing. If this was from any other band it would be pretty good, but this is sub par. The production is tight and the performances are good, but the songs are weak and just plain dull. I admire Petrucci for being a bit more laid back in the interest of the song, but you hardly hear him on this CD. The band is playing brilliantly on this new offering but the songs hardly have the appeal they used to. In response to those who seem to get offended by those who are giving this album weak reviews and call them idiots, well, people are entitled to their opinions. I love it when a band has the courage to try new things and progress and DT are certainly one of those bands, but I do NOT like this album. This is the third album in a row that has forsaken the great melodies they used to incorporate into their terrific performances. A DT album was always exciting, beautiful, and a little eccentric. This one is none of the above. They seem to have taken a few cool ideas and stretched them into an entire CD. I think there has been a slow slide into mediocrity since Scenes From A Memory (which was phenomenal, albeit the silly lyrics). On this new one, there are a few great riffs and ideas here and there, but this is probably the weakest of all DT albums in my opinion.
B000000OAA|5.0|this is truly one of the greatest rock albums i'v heard, from hard rock 'brighton rock and stone cold crazy,' to rag time 'lerory brown and killer queen,' this is a great rock album. both versions of 'in the lap of the gods,' are fantastic.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|I've always considered these reviews to be a way to find new music: If I agreed with another reviewer about several CDs, I might try something they recommended. Reviewers like Lord Chimp and Wickerman were two of my early favorites. So when I write how this album completely sucked, I'm not being a fanboy or trasher, I'm trying to help other readers who might want to get an idea of what I like and don't like. If that helps someone out there pick up some great music - and avoid garbage like this - then my reviews are doing what they're supposed to, not gaining me more votes so that I too can be a Top x00 Reviewer.<br /><br />Why is this DT's weakest album to date? Writing. It sucks. The only tracks that catch my interest are \\"These Walls\\", \\"I Walk Beside You\\", and \\"Panic Attack.\\" \\"Never Enough\\" has moments, and \\"The Root of all Evil\\" has a great title and a brief instrumental passage before the middle break that's breathtaking, but the rest of this recording is just dreadfully dull. \\"Octavarium\\" (the song) is an outtake from Pink Floyd, as is much of \\"Sacrificed Sons;\\" not to insult PF fans, I just don't want that much of their style showing up in a DT release. And for the rest of the album, there aren't any hooks in these songs - I don't mean like in a pop formula, I mean something you find yourself humming right away or hours later. One reviewer wrote, back on 6DoIT, that there was nothing memorable about that music, and while I disagreed on that recording, I'll say it here: There's nothing memorable about this release. Except, that is, how it has so little to enjoy.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that these guys are overextended on side projects. Their writing has deteriorated since SfaM, and now so has their performance. And those lyrics? Dreadful. Insipid. Boring. By comparison, the lyrics on this release make Lost Horizon look like e.e. cummings. They spent months writing and arranging this CD, so why does most of the material seem so weak and undeveloped?<br /><br />Exceptions: \\"These Walls\\" sounds like an uptempo Journey number from the mid-80s; whereas songs like this normally strike me as appeasements for the record company, on this CD it's actually the best song. (That's scary.) \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is similar, very radio-friendly (even in length, at 4:29). \\"Panic Attack\\" is fast and has an echo of the work I expect from DT.<br /><br />But that's all I can find here. 75 minutes of multitrack work and  I can only appreciate about 1/4 of it. And that title track - even worse than the last Royal Hunt album. It's so damned dull it makes me angry I looked forward to another epic DT track. Even Falling Into Infinity had better writing than this, and that was my least favorite in the DT discography before this. No doubt DT fans will buy this release anyway, but I'm warning anyone willing to read about my reactions: You *might* like this recording, but don't bet on it. Fates Warning's recent \\"FWX\\" spanks this CD from start to finish.<br /><br />I give this two stars for a few decent tracks and glimpses of greatness on a couple others, but take away a star for putting out something that's overall this weak and dull. DT swings and misses by a LOT this time out...veloped? <br /> <br />Exceptions: \\"These Walls\\" sounds like an uptempo Journey number from the mid-80s; whereas songs like this normally strike me as appeasements for the record company, on this CD it's actually the best song.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Folks, this is one time where I can confidently say that the hype is credible. Believe it. It's not fabricated just for your benefit, it's real. This album is authentic, bold, and daring. The quality of this album has been understated. This is a significant improvement over their previous works. Some of the high-brow reviewers have obviously lost touch with the modern universe if they think this album is anything less than a masterpiece. I could just imagine a song like \\"Twisted Logic\\" playing over the closing credits for a movie like \\"War of the Worlds.\\" It's got such beautiful dark, rich tones. I hope this album marks the beginning of an extraordinary career for Coldplay. They truly deserve it.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album has a sort of contention in my brain as to whether I like it. Maynard, who is known for being a perfectionist, and Co. manage to make an album that comes off sounding exactly as how they meant it to sound: Songs fit perfectly together, there is no discernable flaws in the production, the songs are all perfect for what they are meant to be, Maynard's vocals are there(which will make basically any album good, or maybe I shouldn't say that after hearing _eMOTIVe_) and the album flows along nicely together. <br /> <br />So what do I dislike about it? <br /> <br />To be perfectly honest: Prentention.  <br /> <br />They seem to be full of them songs and think they can throw in a song that is basically someone counting to 8. Some may call this genius, and I consider the interludes on the Tool album _Lateralus_ to be exactly that, but here they come off as something that is dragging the album along. Where on _Mer De Noms_, APC come off as a more mainstream and pacified Tool, on _Thirteenth Step_ they come off as a mediocre version of Tool that is basically worse in most ways. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this album is superb, and without drastically changing it it is hard to see how it could be better, but the little additions of \\"Genius\\" just come off as annoying.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was my first Green Day CD I got. I listened to Boulavard of Broken Dreams on the radio and was like 'gotta buy this CD'. <br />When I finally did, wow! Holiday is wicked cool! Jesus of Suberbia, is very long! (just over 9 minutes, just=few seconds) But it's awesome! Dearly Beloved is my favorite part of the song. St. Jimmy is a fast song, and it's awesome. My least favorite is probably Are We the Waiting? American Idiot is cool song, but check out GreenDay.com for the music video, awesome!
B0001CCXY8|1.0|There is this thing that Underground groups are good because they don't get played by MTV is good is a terrible feeling. <br />These guys do not get played on MTV and they also suck. This may be the worst album of the new millenium.
B00097A5I6|3.0|After the abysmal Be Here Now, I'd seriously written off the Gallagher brothers. But Heathen Chemistry showed signs of life. Now with Don't Believe the Truth, Oasis seems to have rejected the hype and put their talent where their mouths used to be and delivered a fine, swaggering tribute to late 60s rock. Maybe because Noel isn't writing all the songs, he can afford to be more judicious with his selections with Liam, Gem and Andy Bell sharing the load. The result is a solid effort that will surprise many with its tenacity and grip on the Kinks, Stones & the Beatles, of course. I love it when I'm proven wrong like this!
0446310786|5.0|As others have stated, I can't believe I wasn't forced to read this book during my school years. I guess it's because we Australians would be outraged if American literature took precedence over our home grown 'talent'. <br /> <br />Anyway, besides the great moral inherent in this story (which never makes for a great book without being well written), the character development is second to none. I've never read a book before or since which convinces you that characters you are reading about are so real. Not only that, you just fall in love with the ideosyncrasies of each character. <br /> <br />This book is a 'classic' in every sense of the word.
076781326X|5.0|Oliver! is a lavish color muscical version of Charles Dickens' classic novel Oliver Twist.  If you haven't seen  this movie yet, you'll probably recognize some of the hit songs, including \\"Consider Yourself,\\" and \\"Where Is Love?\\"<br /><br />If you haven't read the book either, it's about a high-spirited orphan kicked out of the orphanage in Victorian England.  He escapes his new masters (undertakers!) and makes his way to London, where he's taken under the wing of Fagin (Ron Moody), a fence who employs a group of pocket-picking boys.<br /><br />The film deservedly won 6 Academy Awards, incluing Best Picture.  The actors are all perfect, especially Lester as Oliver and Wild as The Artful Dodger.  If you're the right age, you'll remember Jack Wild from the Saturday morning show H.R. Pufnstuf.  Most of the musical numbers are very entertaining, some quite spectacular, and fit in well with the story.  In my own humble opinion, this is one of the last good big musical productions filmed (though I also liked 1776 very much, a few years later).
006054094X|1.0|Anyone who is seriously considering spending money on this book should read Robert Finlay's review in the June 2004 issue of _Journal of World History_.  You will learn far more factual information from Finlay's review than from Menzies's book, and you'll save yourself some $$$ in the process.
B0007NFL18|5.0|WOW.  There is not one song on this CD that i don't absolutely love! 50 Cent is the best. Plain and simple. ;-) PEACE
B00030590I|4.0|After reading several reviews of this movie, I feel a bit obligated to comment on the harsher reviews.  Coming from a Chinese perspective, I watched the movie with the English subtitles, and realized that there will always be something lost in the translation.  The writing cannot be judged from the subtitles.  The script was written in something of classical Chinese (think Shakespeare vs. modern English).  As for the martial arts, unless you've seen more than just Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon and House of the Flying Daggers, and unless you've actually studied and learned the arts, it's difficult to pick up on the subtle differences in fighting style.  Finally, this movie is not so much about the martial arts as it is about the cinematography, music, artistry, and simplicity that is so characteristic of modern Chinese film.  This is the type of film you must see at least twice in order to fully appreciate it.  If you like foreign films and a change of pace from the mainstream Western films, you will enjoy this movie.
B0007WZUMY|4.0|Some people might suggest that Audioslave's new album \\"Out of Exile\\" is a bit of a letdown compared to their harder-hitting debut, but I just look at it as a slightly different animal...not necessarily better, or worse...just a bit different...a new direction.  True, they didn't seem to include quite as many \\"heavy\\" tunes this time around, but that doesn't make it any less worthy of a listen.  If their self-titled album was described as being \\"3 parts Rage Against The Machine and 1 part Chris Cornell\\", I suppose \\"Out of Exile\\" might be better described as \\"3 Parts Chris Cornell and 1 part R.A.T.M.\\"....but that is most definetly not a _bad_ thing.  It's still Audioslave, and they still rock. <br /> <br />As for the Japanese Import album, the cd insert is a bit \\"misleading\\", to put it nicely.  There are 2 bonus tracks listed:  \\"Super Stupid\\", and \\"Like a Stone (Live)\\".  Take note of how they specifically mention that \\"Like a Stone\\" is a Live track.  What they fail to disclose is that the version of \\"Super Stupid\\" is also a live version (in fact, the same old previously released BBC Radio1 Session from the \\"Like a Stone\\" cd single). <br /> <br />So if you already own a cd-single with \\"Super Stupid\\" on it, there's really no need to spend three times as much money on this Japanese Import Album to get it.  Buy the European Import version of \\"Out of Exile\\" for ~$10 less if you still want the live bonus track of \\"Like a Stone\\" (it's a nice acoustic version).
B0006L16N8|3.0|'Parachutes' did not rock my world.  But 'Rush Of Blood To The Head', did.  The lyrics of this album were often cliche, but sung with believeable sincerity to a poetic rock sound that grabbed the listener instantly and did not ever let go.<br /><br />So, I was excited for X&Y to come out.  I thought if ROBTTH followed 'Parachutes', what would Coldplay do next?<br /><br />X&Y has finally been released and I wonder now if ROBTTH wasn't a fluke:  the lyrics are not only cliche this time round, but literal and preachy.  These are lyrics in which the singer directly address the listener, leaving no place for the listener to sidestep into the song and enjoy it (i.e. sing it) as if the song were an expression of the lister's own mood.  Musically the songs are rich in depth of sound, but inorganic and heavy handed.<br /><br />I'm not that dissapointed, though, that X&Y is not the great Coldplay album that I hoped it would be.  I classify albums as 'forgettable' and 'great'.  X&Y is just one forgettable album of many, whereas ROBTTH happened to be one album in a (smaller), but ever growing, group of great albums.  A big heads up for those bands who have put out more than one great album.
B0009AM5JA|2.0|Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head were two great albums. X&amp;Y is probably a transition without  a clear direction. A blend of U2, Radiohead, Oasis, Beatles and sometimes Electric Light Orchestra sounds. Its not a bad album, but not one in the standard of the two previous. Again, Martin offers a very good vocal part and the instrumental parts are good too. But the compositions suffer from a lack of organisation and personality. They need to find their own sound and Im sure it will come with the growing maturity of the band.<BR>   <BR>The real problem with this album is the sound quality. Its incridible, we are in 2005 and a band like Coldplay is not enough professional to give us a recording without distortion. The sound (wanted or not), on this new album, is simply cheaper than many analog recordings done in the 60s and than remastered on cd. Its a shame that a band and a cd compagny  sell that kind of product in our digital time. Instead of using a copy control devise (and with that, insulting the real buyers of cd who like doing their own compilation for their own use), EMI should be more aware of the quality of what they sell to the people.<br />The work on this album deserve at least 3 stars, but for the real « audiophiles » because of the bad quality sound, I give it, only 2 stars.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|I honestly can't understand the vehement angst and negativity against this film by Trekkers and average viewers alike. The tragedy about this film is that it was pre-judged by rumors in the press, thoroughly trashed. When this movie came out, I was actually publishing a magazine and my film critic quit because I wouldn't publish his review (rather than write a review, he chose to write a biased tirade about why he hated Star Trek). <br /> <br />Enough of that! The FX in this film are awful, some of them aren't even as well done as the FX in the original 1960s TV series. However, that wasn't William Shatner's fault. What happened is that there were too many leaks in the press that got back to Paramount, and they pulled the plug on FX. Luckily ILM allowed them to reuse select previous FX shots from previous films...so that, at least, you won't really notice anything amiss until about 30 minutes into the film. <br /> <br />The opening scene in this movie took my breath away. It's desolate, haunting and epic, with some of the best scoring by Jerry Goldsmith ever. This scene, which introduces Sybock, is one of the best introductions in ANY Star Trek film, or ANY film for that matter. It's that good. <br /> <br />The campfire scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy are some of the greatest scenes in the entire pantheon of Star Trek. There is great chemistry here, and McCoy's \\"special ingredient\\" in that chili, plus Kirk's remark about \\"an explosive combination\\" are truly delivered to evoke side-splitting laughter. Sure it's adolescent humor, but as a preamble to their subsequent philosophical discussion, it works! <br /> <br />Although much of the humor works, some of it doesn't. It works when Nimoy delivers a very subtle \\"Yes!\\" to Shatner's uninvited exclamation that \\"I could use a shower!\\" Where it doesn't work is when Scotty hits his head on the bulkhead. Again, when a bumbling Kirk, McCoy and Spock accelerate up the elevator shaft, it's more like a scene out of the Three Stooges. <br /> <br />The scene where Sybock shows them their greatest fear is underrated and perhaps the greatest acting ever presented in the sequence of Star Trek films, particularly by DeForrest Kelly. Kirk's adamant refusal to participate (e.g. \\"I need my pain!\\") is perhaps the closest that one ever comes to looking into the window of Kirk's soul, the real driving power behind Star Trek. <br /> <br />Finally, the confrontation between Kirk and \\"God\\" is the most pronounced and philosophical statement of Star Trek, a point hinted at in the TV series to be sure, but never so humorously depicted as in ST 5. To wit, Shatner's brilliant line about \\"Why does GOD need a starship?\\" With all due respect to those of faith, that is a question that any thinking person would ask about the angry war-making \\"god\\" of the Old Testament. <br /> <br />As for Jerry Goldsmith's musical score, this soundtrack is the second best soundtrack of any of the Star Trek films (his score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture is obviously the first best score). When Mr. Goldsmith died last year, we truly lost one of the Great Ones, second only to John Williams, and some might even debate that. <br /> <br />This film actually works better on TV. I attribute that to William Shatner's somewhat uncertain use of film and being more familiar with television. But, considering the fact that some scenes fully exploit the film medium on an epic scale, it is probably true that what ultimately spoiled this movie on the Big Screen is Paramount's pulling the plug on FX...virtually ruining the whole experience for Star Trek fans who by that time had become accustomed to good effects. That they were simultaneously broadcasting Next Generation with first class FX just made Paramount's decision that much more damning. Remember that this is the same studio that sat on the Star Trek franchise for almost 9 years before being prompted by the success of Star Wars to dust off their property and save Gene Goddenberry from Skid Row (typo is lovingly intentional). <br /> <br />One may be confused as to why I gave this film 5 stars in spite of the obvious flaws mentioned. The reason is that this film has an important story to tell, and tells it very well, despite the flaws. In a way, the story really begins at the campsite with Kirk, Spock and McCoy, and it ends at the campsite with Kirk, Spock and McCoy (literally), leaving a very good feeling inside. Originally I thought Star Trek V was their swan song. I'm glad it wasn't, but wouldn't have minded if it was...like a fade out into retirement... <br /> <br />This is a great Star Trek film and I never get tired of watching it!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|First off, this is my first Foo Fighters album I have purchased. I liked earlier songs but never felt compelled to buy a whole album. Having read early reviews and the list of impressive guest artists I figured I would get this. ITs a pretty  damn good album, and a double at that. I listened to it all this morning and afternoon on my work drives and I have to admit I have a hard time listenting to most albums all the way through but BOTH discs are fantastic!  <br /> <br />Now i was hesitant to get it since I saw the big COPY PROTECTED sticker on it. And going through all the enhanced menu stuff on it even made me more wary since I have a mac and it all defers basically to Windows users and Windows Media Player, which sucks on a Mac. But As I type this I just ripped the whole cd using my iTunes and loaded it into my iPod with no problem whatsoever. So I guess they didn't quite figure a way to copy protect it for Mac users :) So Apple users buy without fear. A great double cd from a great band.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I absolutely loved the first Gorillaz album, it is without a doubt one of my favorite albums, so of course, when I saw they were coming out with a new album, I wanted it. However, when I first heard the backstory for this new album (The Automator out, Danger Mouse in), I was a tad discouraged. Then, I read the reviews (\\"Different...much different\\"; \\"Completely new sound\\"), a was even more skeptical. However, I bought it anyway, almost out of sheer curiosity. Within 5 minutes into the CD, you know that old sound is completely out, Danger Mouse is NOT Dan The Automator and therefor will NOT sound the same, but I got into it, and it wasn't hard, not in the least. This album is as extremely accessible as the first one, and almost every song has that same \\"single worthy\\" sound to it. Yes, it is different. Yes, it tends to seem much darker. But, I believe that simply by the makeup of the band (4 cartoon characters, none of which (except 2D (Damon Albarn) having a set human counterpart portraying them), it should be expected that this album would be a completely new sound. I know that Danger Mouse only got the job because Dan and Damon had a falling out, but I truly believe that every Gorillaz album should have Albarn partnering with a new producer, it would definitely exponentially enhance my enjoyment of this band and the abstract concept of it. All in all, if you're already a Gorillaz fan, this should be a very welcomed change, and if you're not, pick up this CD, because it's really fantastic and diverse, and be sure to get the original as well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />PS. I will however admit that I miss Del basically being a part of the band, no offense, but they really do take a hit from losing him.
B00003CXE7|5.0|One of my friends made a comment last night at a dinner party that Gladiator was a guys' only film. I couldn't agree less. I won't go into the story summaries as so many reviewers have already covered that territory, but this film is definitely a winner for women, as well. The story is engaging, the acting is amazing, and the cinemetography is divine. I'm the type of person who cried at the end of Terminator, so I know my tastes aren't for everyone, but this movie wasn't just a blood bath or gorefest as some people -- my friend included -- say. I own the film and watch it often. It's a true classic.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green day along with all the other New rock bands suck.  Listen to the true starters of real rock like Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Sabbath, Aerosmith, AcDc and the others...not this come on
B0006L16N8|5.0|Excellent!!! This is Coldplay's best album. I love every single song. I was eagerly anticipating this album and it did not disappoint. All of my expectations were met and then some. It's truly an amazing record. I would recommend it for music lovers of all ages.
B00074CBIS|4.0|What will you get from this film? You will get laughs and relaxation. The plot is simple. A gang of gorgeous models are on a crime spree. Their success is accidentally aided by the dumbest detective (Jimmy Fallon) that I have ever seen. His stupidity even costs him his driver's license, so he is forced to take a cab in order to investigate the crimes. Enter Belle (Queen Latifah) with a souped-up taxi, and you know that wild, chase scenes and unbelievable driving will follow. Queen Latifah dominates the movie with her cool and her antics. Jimmy Fallon acts like this is a scene from Saturday Night Live, but Ann-Margret is hilarious as the detective's continually-sloshed mother. All in all, it's a pleasant film.
B0002234LS|4.0|Since the plot mainly revolves around the main character, obviously the main actor needs to carry alot of the scenes well. And Johnny Depp does a really great job and seems entertaining to watch throughout, adding in a few improvisational movements at times outside of the script to keep things animated. The other actors too do a pretty good job in this film, but are less developed to keep the focus on the main character and have the audience drawn into his perspective more. <br /> <br />The seemingly simple premise has been already been explained and it's best to leave the extent of your knowledge of the story at that if you're going to enter this film. Although if you think the premise is *too* simple, don't be discouraged, as I think it's pretty obvious that the intiial idea is more of a springboard. Or at least that's the thought I had when deciding to go and watch this. <br /> <br />Having not seen any trailers or anything, I wasn't dissapointed at the slow start (although really it's not that slow, since it introduces the antagonist immediately), I didn't feel this spoilt my enjoyment. In hindsight it's obviously time spent getting to know the main character and be drawn into his perspective which I think is important. A key point to enjoying this film and the eventual path it takes is if you are drawn to the main character or not I think. <br /> <br />The other key point is to not clue yourself in on some of the eventual twists in the proverbial path of plot. If you 'get' it early on I think it is probably safe to say that the film loses quite a lot since it's all riding on that aspect. But if you don't 'get' it then you're in for a treat. It's really a hit or miss type situation. <br /> <br />Even if you do 'get' it I think you'll still be surprised at certain points or at the conclusion. And what with the nice acting and some nice colour considerations/filming (in my opinion) and a decent soundtrack, I think you can still be entertained. <br /> <br />Although this is a suspense film (or whatever you might call it), there's still some humour in it that I liked. <br /> <br />Watching the extras on the DVD gives you a greater appreciation for some of the more subtle design considerations. Mainly with colours. Without giving too much away I love their stark choice of colours and high contrast during the negative flashbacks. And for the later flashbacks, they taught me a new word, \\"ektachrome\\" (I believe that was it), which seems to give a very effective finish that I was impressed with. The extras also feature information on other aspects of the design. I noted certain props and elements popping up repeatedly whilst watching the film and the exact reasoning is explained in the extras which gives you a new perspective on things if you didn't catch it the first time round. You also get to see some footage of Johnny Depp and others during filming. The commentary track is pretty good. If only they'd kept some outtakes of trying to get the animals to work which was mentioned in the commentary, might of been fun to watch. I didn't notice any outtakes within the extras however (I really think that every film/series release should include outtakes as they're a fun bonus). <br /> <br />The soundtrack is nicely put together and compliments the various tense scenes very well. The opening titles music immediately had me hooked on the music. <br /> <br />I don't think you can really go into too much depth with a film like this so I'll just say that I found it to be an entertaining film. Worth a watch at least once.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|If you are a progressive rock fan, you're gonna like this album. But after a few listens, you're gonna back to your Yes, Spock's Beard, King Crimson, Peter Gabriel and Genesis albums.<br /><br />There are a plenty of good stuff in here, but still there's something wrong with the band, something's missing...<br /><br />Anyone here though about Kevin Moore?<br /><br />Good. So let's talk about the material here to justify my meanings:<br /><br />The Root of all Evil -> Tsc, tsc. Another mediocre song, another reference to past works. Could sound interesting, if the song itself wasn't this 'more-of-the-same' thing. They told it for themselves: it's the root of the band's evil.<br /><br />The Answer Lies Within -> Hummm... so LaBrie wants to be a ballad singer again. Not bad, not bad, but there are so much better ballads that Dream Theater made in the past. I think the band needs &lt;Moore> inspiration, don't you?<br /><br />These Walls -> Oh, c'mon boy, another low tune guitar thing and I'm gonna freak out! But the most curious thing here is that the low tuned riffs doesn't bother too much, as the song is well structured and have a lovely solo section.<br /><br />I Walk Beside You -> Hey, who took Dream Theater's album out and put a U2 album? Oh, it's not U2? Man, I could swear I was listening to Bono and The Edge playing on it! Maybe it's my imagination...<br /><br />Panic Attack -> It was that the idea behind this song, to give me a panic attack? Oh, cool, you did it! It is the worst, bad written solos and riffs collection that I ever listened in my whole life! What else can I say? AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!<br /><br />Never Enough -> Humm... for a metal band it sounds nice, but... for a rock/metal prog act... sounds acceptable. At least it's not bad as the previous track was.<br /><br />Sacrificed Sons -> This one also could call \\"How to destroy what could be a potentially good epic in a simple instrumental section\\". Nothing more to declare. C'mon, guys, &lt;Moore> inspiration!<br /><br />And finnaly, we get on the big one:<br /><br />Octavarium -> At least this one justifies all the hype. It's not another \\"A Change of Seasons\\", far from that, but it remains like the only 100% good track on the whole record. The references festival here goes from instrumental parts like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Genesis, Yes, Rick Wakeman, and Rush to lyrical references like Beatles, Genesis, Yes, Doors, Ramones(???) and so on. Excelent Spock's Beard like tunes, also with very good orchestration. It seems like working with Neal Morse produced good outputs on the Mike Portnoy's writer habilities. Neal, man, you're a miracle! Keep up your mind in Jesus!<br /><br />Now, let me back here to my Nothing is Easy album.<br /><br />By the way, when will Kevin rejoin the band again?s all the hype.

B00063MBU8|1.0|THIS ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE IN GRADE 3 OR SOMETHING. ALL THE SONG TOPICS ARE ALIKE. THEY MUST HAVE GOTTEN SOME MAJOR BETTINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL I CAN SEE. THE FIRST ALBUM A OK. IT HAD BETTER SONGS THAN THIS ONE. BUT THIS ALBUM TOTALY SUCKS. I WASTED 15 DOLLARS ON THIS. I CAN'T BELIEVE A LEGEND LIKE BOB ROCK WOULD PRODUCE SUCH A CRAPPY BAND!
B00005JLEU|4.0|This is a lovely movie, for the most part. The animation and graphics are a lush treat for the eyes, and the fantasy elements are awe-inspiring. If you can willingly suspend your disbelief, the strange and wonderful things that the young heroine encounters in the spirit world are unbelievably cool: There's a weird old man who works ceaselessly in a boiler room with his hundreds of legs; an entire flock of fluttering paper birds; and an endless parade of \\"spirits\\" of every type. There is a small problem, though, which prevents me from giving Spirited Away a perfect score: a lot of things don't make much sense. Some loose ends are never tied up, and some story elements are never explained. Overall, watching this feels like having a really good dream; you'll get wrapped up in its wonder, but you awake a bit disoriented.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The play created history. The music created history; and I think the film does justice! <br /> <br />What does one expext from this film, if one has not seen the play (which I have not)? Sheer lavishness, grandeur, a heartfelt narratative of romance and awesome music. You'll have experienced all this and more once you have seen the film! <br /> <br />Right from the beginning of the film, one can sense the artistic sensibilities that have gone into making this film.  <br />The film begins with a beautifully picturised scene of an auction in Paris. The image is black-and-white, aprears broken, and the sound seems fragmented. At the auction. when the chandelier (connected with the never-completely-solved mystery of the Phantom Of The Opera) is revealed- the scene transforms into lavish colour, loud brilliant music; then story of the past begins- the story of the Choir girl Christine, her love Raoul and the Phantom of the Opera himself. <br /> <br />It is interesting to see that here, unlike in most films, the present is shown in black-and-white scenes (which give you the feeling of old undeveloped images), and the past is shown in lavish colour. <br /> <br />The only negative aspect of the film is that at times, actually at very few times, you'll find yourself yawning. The film does get slow at a few places- but those places are too few and far-between to hamper the overall impact of this magnificent film. <br /> <br />Even though it is a musical, and most of the narrative is through song, one never wishes it wasn't that way. The songs and how they are sung keep you engrossed. <br /> <br />This mesmerising, excellently-made film is truly a must-see. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|2.0|This album is not good at all. I can not believe people compare it to Pretty Hate Machine, no NIN album is comparable to PHM, especially this one. The good songs I thought were #2 and #6, the last one was ok, but nothing stood out in it to make me remember it and want to listen to it again. Number 8 just makes me lose all faith in Trent. This album, and any other NIN album will live up to Pretty Hate Machine, but if your into nowadays music then you'll probably like it, but for oldschool fans, this sucks.
B000002GFC|5.0|A \\"Very Best of?\\"  Maybe not.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of \\"Wrapping Paper\\"...that should've been replaced with something else...maybe \\"Toad.\\"  Every other song is excellent. <br /> <br />As is with all \\"Best of,\\" \\"Hits,\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections, there are always selections that are left off that people feel should have been included.  But then again, that's the \\"Best Hits\\" collections for you. <br /> <br />As far as this \\"Very Best of\\" collection goes, it serves as a great intro to the band.  I think it's an outstanding compilation.  In my case, it was pretty much the only Cream CD in the store.  I would highly recommend this to any fans of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, or just anyone that is into rock or the music of the late 60s in general, or if you're just starting to take an interest in Cream. <br /> <br />That said, try to get a hand on their live records (Live Cream Vol. 1 & 2).  I don't even know if those made it onto CD, so you might want you shop on eBay.  Since Cream was at their best live, I'd recommend the live volumes before the studio albums (of course, be sure to get the studio albums too).
B0009HLDFU|5.0|AWESOME... This cd is definately the album of the year so far. It is some of the Foo Fighters most rocking songs to date! The acoustic album is beautiful, and his voice DOES fit very well with the music. I highly recommend this CD. You will not be disappointed.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|As always, \\"Best of\\" collections leave off tracks that should arguably be on there, so they're usually 4-star material in my book.  Being a huge Hendrix fan, I've listened to all of his music, and I certainly agree that this has most of his hits.  You won't get a better \\"Best of\\" Hendrix bargain anywhere.  This is the perfect place to start. <br /> <br />Of course, if you have all of his individual albums...well then there's really no point in buying it.  Some people say you need this (in addition to all his original albums) for a \\"true collection\\" -- I'd say to them that you need \\"Smash Hits\\" instead because it was released while he was still alive. <br /> <br />Now, there are a few tracks I would have liked to have seen on here.  \\"Ezy Ryder,\\" \\"Drifting,\\" and \\"Hey Baby\\" would be my top three.  I also would like to have seen \\"You Got Me Floatin\\" and \\"Ain't No Telling\\" for a nice number 25. <br /> <br />Now, all that aside, this is a great bargain.  That's 10 bucks for 20 of Hendrix's songs -- that's .50 apiece.  You wouldn't do better at the Wal-Mart music store.  If you're new to Hendrix, or if you're one of those people who has all the albums but for some weird reason want to buy Hendrix's best hits anyway, then GET THIS CD.  If you're any kind of Hendrix fan, your satisfaction is guaranteed.
B00004TDRD|4.0|I got this VHS tape on my 9th birthday in 2000 (the year before we discovered the wonderful quality of DVD) and I absolutley loved it! I remember seeing it on television a few months before and thought it was a great movie, although it scared me when the boy was eaten. The quality of the movie is typical VHS, and the sound could be a little better (thus, 4 stars instead of 5). Now I am 13 and am anticipating the arrival of the 30th Anniversery DVD in the mail. This is one of my all-time favorite movies (though it would have been better if the shark's presence was more suggested and you only saw the mechanical shark when you had to).
B00004TR2G|5.0|i have purchased this CD from amazon .com being a fan for the movie.The moment i played it in my system , i imagined myself being in the sea with the great white right in front of me.The score by John Williams is a masterpiece and i would recommend this product to any one who likes melody and suspense in listening.Great work Mr.Williams.
B000002MFN|5.0|In 1992,Madonna out of her teen idol phase,put out this so-called \\"sexy\\" album. That same year,she made her literary debut with SEX. Here is the start of what would later become her GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 album,released in 2001. The title track is definitely sexy. She covers the classic FEVER,which was previously recorded by a handful of other artists. There's the hip-hop flavored WHY IS IT SO HARD? and WAITING. Excerpts of the latter track are heard on DID YOU DO IT?,which is also hip-hop flavored.  BAD GIRL is cool(\\"Bad girl,drunk by six,kissing somebody else's lips,smoked too many cigarettes today,I'm not happy when I act this way.\\"). WHERE LIFE BEGINS has the rhythm that is called \\"groundbeat\\". THIEF OF HEARTS is mildly raunchy with lyrics like \\"Stop,bitch! Now sit your ass down!\\". The other songs are great.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Admit it, this band is a gimmick, just like Kiss. <br />It seems to me these guys released the same album three times in a row, my god, how much I hate this terrible band. <br />and \\"Opium of the People\\"'s opening riff is a complete rip-off of Converge's \\"The Saddest Day\\", this album is complete trash. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, you mall gawths, buy a good album, which includes anything by Converge and Isis, I shouldn't even waste my time telling any of you about good music.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|No offense, but Shakira kind of sucks in English.  I was so happy to see that this entire album is in Spanish.  This sounds more like the Shakira I loved before she became a sell-out and dyed her hair blond and sang in English.  She just sounds better in Spanish and her lyrics don't sound so awkward.  I love that there are two versions of 'La Tortura' and 'La Pared.'  'Dia de enero' is the song that is on permanent repeat in my cd player.  This cd took a couple times of listening to it to really appreciate it, but in the end, it's really good...still not as good as 'Donde estan los ladrones?' but that's pretty hard to beat.
0553062182|5.0|I'm glad I ordered this book without reading the reviews below. It was recommended thru a web site for the highly sensitive, and it has help me a lot. After the first few chapters, I felt enlivened and relieved to know that there were others like me and that I was a minority, but normal. It's difficult to be a HSP in a gung-ho world of extraverts. It is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone who feels like they don't fit in with most and who shy away from too much noise or commotion.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This is definetley my favorite show and although I am disapointed to hear that they are dramatically changing certain characters roles, I am still excited for a second season.  It has everything to be a great show.  There is mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat, a little bit of romance with Veronica and her lovers, a lot of shocking cliff hangers, definite humor and even some tear jerkers.  It is such an amazing show that i got hooked on real quick. I can't wait to get it on DVD!! If this show seems the least bit intreuging to you, i seriously encourage you to buy the first season when it comes out because i know you will be hooked like me.  Then watch the second season!! It is SUCH a wonderful show.. watch it!! :)
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears hit radio in late 1998 with her ubiquitous single \\"...Baby One More Time.\\"  In January 1999 she released her first album, the best-selling teen pop album in history, of the same title; backed by the power of her Grammy-nominated No. 1 hit, the record stayed on top of the Billboard charts for an unprecedented number of weeks.  In 2000 the teen super-sensation hit the charts again with her appropriately titled Oops!...I Did It Again, hit No. 1 on the singles and albums charts, and beat out Mariah Carey as the fastest-selling female artist for 1.3 million copies moved its first week out.  The fab title tune, reminiscent of Britney's first nearly two years earlier, proved to be one of music's biggest, and celebrity ballad \\"Lucky,\\" girl-power \\"Stronger\\" and country-twinged \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last to Know\\" followed, proving this girl wasn't just a flap in the pan of pop music.  Oops!...I Did It Again is a sure-fire bubblegum album and, save for its latter half of string-heavy ballads (which do not suit Britney's so-so vocals), is a near-perfect pop confection.  Some of the more techo-oriented tracks (like \\"Stronger\\" and \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\") take away the real sound to the pop star's voice, but in the end that doesn't really even matter: Like her or not, Britney did do it again on Oops! and boy did she get it right!
0062502182|4.0|<br />          <br />         Darion White <br />         English <br />         June 9, 2005 <br /> <br />        The Alchemist <br /> <br /> <br /> Have you ever had a dream that you tried to follow and figure it out? Well, reading The Alchemist will tell you all about following your dreams and your personal legend. The Alchemist has one hundred seventy three pages worth of reading. The genre of The Alchemist is fiction and is written by Paulo Coelho. In the book Santiago the main character, is a character that's trying to follow his dream, which is trying to find a treasure that he dreamed for two days about. The theme of The Alchemist is following your dreams.  <br /> In The Alchemist, Coelho writes with style. Paulo Coelho style is very effective. Paulo Coelho has his characters talking just like they would talk to other characters. For example, \\" I am following my personal legend. It's not something you would understand.\\" (Pg 111) That their shows that the author Paulo Coelho has style and that he's effective as well. <br />Santiago, which is the main character, is the protagonist. This story goes around Santiago. Santiago is a dynamic character, because he experienced a lot of changes during the course of the story. Also, there isn't any person in The Alchemist who's the protagonist; but nature shows the force in conflict with the protagonist. <br />  One reason why I recommend The Alchemist to other readers is because the book teaches not just teenagers, but adults also to follow your dreams and your personal legend. \\"It's what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.\\"(Pg 21) Also, I recommend this book because the Author Paulo Coelho uses a lot of imagery, which is effective that could put the readers in the book to make it seem real. \\" They went to drink the tea, <br /> which was served in beautiful glasses.\\" (Pg 59)  <br />Finally, I recommend this book because it tells you to be what youwant to be, and not what someone else wants you to be. Santiago wanted to travel while his parents wanted him to become a priest, but Santiago followed his own mind.\\" His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family.\\" (Pg 8) \\" Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.\\" Said his father.\\" Well, then I'll be a shepherd.\\" \\" His father said no more.\\" (Pg 9) As you can see Santiago made his own decisions, and that's why I recommend this book to anyone who wants to follow their dreams to be what ever you want to be in life.  <br />  In conclusion, I will like to say to all the readers that this is one of the best books I've enjoyed so far. This book The Alchemist has taught me to follow what I want to be in life and don't give up my dreams. And if The Alchemist can help me follow my dreams and personal legends it can help you as well.          <br />    <br />
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney Spears' third studio album talks about a lot of things.  On the simply-titled Britney, the singing sensation is a \\"Slave 4 U,\\" \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" just to name a few.  2001's breakout Grammy-nominated and best-selling record proves to be a sure-fire hit like Her Britness' two other albums, but while ...Baby and Oops! targeted a more bubblegum and teen audience, her third justifies itself as an album almost anybody can enjoy.  Featuring an impressive track list of pop/rock/funk smokers, 2001's Britney is a must-listen for Brit fans and foes alike.  Though not as memorable as her first and second, and not as good as her fourth (In the Zone), Miss Spears certainly did it right on this CD and should be congratulated for her efforts.  Good...but if you could just purchase tracks 1-5, 8 and 9 it'd be a much better pop confection.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|I just love Nick Cave and he totally rocks with this double album. I like \\"Abattoir Blues\\" because it's noisy and very temperamental, but \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" is great in a mellow but playful kind of way. Cave has confirmed himself as an ultimate poet and The Bad Seeds are perfect instrumentalists. So, if you want to hear very emotional, intelligent, but unusual music, BUY THIS and you won't regret it.
B0007Y08I8|5.0|I've never laughed so hard at a movie. When the unrated version came out, I really wanted to see what they cut out. There is about 5 seconds added to the puppet love scene that was just gross. Rent it before you buy it to see for yourself. I think these guys are brilliant and the added features are outstanding.
B0006L16N8|5.0|First, a little rant...I am tired of critics who pan an album just because it doesn't sound like a previous, beloved release from a group.  Newsflash...it doesn't sound like the last album because it is a new album.  As a band creates more and more together, their musicality evolves.  <br /> <br />That out of the way... I love this album.  Taken by itself (which is the only truly objective way to rate a work) X&Y is a beautifully crafted musical journey to which I can at times tap my foot, and turn intraspective.  Chris Martin's soaring (and well-trained) voice (check out that great diction) is full of feeling and gives the songs emotional umph.  I liked all of the songs, and didn't feel as though I had to skip around.  My favorite tracks are \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\".  \\"Speed of Sound\\" is also a favorite, but most people have heard it on the radio countless times, I'm sure. <br /> <br />The songs aside, what I like most about Coldplay's newest is that it's different than anything else out there. One doesn't have to be a trained musician to realize the talent it takes to put together some of the more musically intricate songs.  This type of musicality is sorely lacking in a lot of the top 40 hits currently on the charts.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a winner.  I highly recommend it to the discerning listener who appreciates fine musical ability, quality vocals, and less fluff.
B00005JLRT|5.0|If anything is to go by, Nemesis is speeding faster even before you can mutter \\"Maximum Warp\\". With its two other predecessors, Nemesis is just one notch above First Contact and two notches above Insurrection. The last action packed Star Trek was First Contact. So, it goes to show that even-numbered Treak movies are action based and the odd-numbered ones are more to storyline based. I, for one, was impressed with the dogfight scenes between the Enterprise and the Reman warbird, Scimitar. As this movie was directed by Stuart Baird(Executive Decision), he brought in a different kind of action (probably his trademark for action) to Nemesis, which was never seen before in all other Trek movies. And the ironic thing is that Nemesis is able to standalone as a gripping sci-fi thriller, in its own right, while at the same time linked to the entire Star Trek anthology. One of the reason Nemesis didn't do well at the box office is that it was shown a week before The Lord Of The Rings (I'm not sure which one of the 3). What a way to ruin a good Trek movie but I can't blame them as November is usually the traditional month when a new Trek movie is release. But, being a staunch Trek fan, overall Nemesis is the best there is. Just can't wait for the next Trek movie though. Bloody marvellous.
0380973634|5.0|I've had friends recommending Neil Gaiman to me for quite a while now, and for some reason, I was just never that enthused about reading anything by him. It turns out, I was really wrong. Neverwhere is the first Gaiman book I've read, and it was excellent. I can't wait to get to other novels by this guy. <br /> <br />Neverwhere is about Richard Mayhew, who is basically an unhappy loser struggling through his everyday life. That is, until he helps out a mysterious girl laying in the streets. After this, he is a loser trying to survive in the fantastical, surreal, dangerous, unbelievablely dark underworld of London. He has to encounter all sorts of maniacal enemies, including two assissins who are perhaps the most morbid I've seen in any story. Of course, he gets drawn into an impossible quest as well, and he has a few friends to accompany him through his adventures. There are some pretty old fantasy motifs here, but with Gaiman writing, everything seems original. There is certainly no excitement lacking in this compelling novel.  <br /> <br />There's also a certain depth to the novel that really adds to the effect. The novel's littered with meaningful allusions to religious stories, fairy tales, and literary works (particularly by G.K. Chesterton). It all culminates into a sort of rumination on the essentiality of imagination to enhance ordinary life and perhaps allow for transcendence.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really solid work. There's plenty to enjoy here and a little to think about.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I am the type that downloads music, and then buys the CD if I really think it is a full quality album.  That is rare, as everyone knows.  I also just bought an iPod Shuffle, and there is no way I will spend my time figuring out how to get around the protection.  Yes, there is always a way around it, though im not a hacker so thats not an enjoyable way to spend however long it takes.   <br />Guess I will just download.... <br />The consumer wins again, Welcome to the new music industry.
B000002BSV|4.0|\\"Coming Up\\"is Suede's most single oriented album,every song(even the dazzling and longer\\"Picnic by the Motorway\\"and\\"The Chemistry between Us\\")seems to have been designed to be a hit single in the vein of the early 90's Anderson/Butler classics so it's no wonder 5 tracks from here charted impressively in the UK.<br /><br />Being such a remarkable,song oriented,record that even contains one of their very best compositions-\\"Filmstar\\"and plenty of other glam punk standouts,there's only one thing preventing this from being an album as awe inspiring as their first two-Bernard Butler was no longer in the band.<br /><br />And that made a huge difference in the band's sonics.Richard Oakes thrashes throughout the record in an extremely competent glam rock fashion but rarely does he transcend the limitations he faces(probably only in the spacial shift of \\"Filmstar's\\" chorus and on\\"Picnic by the motorway's\\"break does he approach B.Butler's genius).<br /><br />Bernard Butler's Johnny Marr meets Andy Bell meets Marc Bolan guitar playing was an essential part of the early 90's Suede sound and that's why even if they remained an interesting band throughout the remainder of their career they never again sounded as vital.<br /><br />Still there's no denying how entertaining an album \\"Coming Up\\"is.
B0009PVZWI|4.0|I agree with the previous review... lock up all the naysayers! This album was meant this way and shows the *incredible* multi-talented Foo Fighters at their best. This is ONE album, not two separates. If you don't like the first one because it's not as good as \\"this or that\\" album...tough luck. It's still good, pure rock and by no means weak. The second disc is most certainly not only appropriate for birthday parties after the Dido disc finished...that's almost an insult. It's a masterpiece and another celebration of musical diversity and an eruption of loads of styles and songs. Fan or no fan, this disc will become one of your favorites. Guaranteed.
B00008WT5M|4.0|Of course Back in Black is the undisputed ruler of the Brian Johnson era of AC/DC, but The Razor's Edge is still kick-a$$. Moneytalks is one of my favorite AC/DC songs and shows the boys can still make some damn catchy riffs. Thunderstruck starts off cool and builds up to an excellent rock song. Are you Ready is so damn catchy you have to sing along to it, and of course the title track is amazing. These are the best songs, but other notable tracks are Fire Your Guns and Rock Your Heart Out. All in all, it's a solid AC/DC album and everyone needs it in their collection. It breaks the slump they had in the late 80s, easily topping Flick of the Switch and Fly on the Wall. Get it.
B000002H70|5.0|Its been said before but its the absolute truth...Disintegration is absolutely the greatest recording of music our generation has and honestly deserves a place in history as one of the best albums EVER!...beautifully ugly,complexly simple,deep,moving,emotional and raw this is everything music should be...i simply cannot envision the universe without it...no joke!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut remains one of the greatest rock albums ever released as well as the band's strongest statement. This was issued at a time when the soft rock of Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles were ruling the airwaves while the hard rock of Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, and Kiss was slowly being replaced by the more radio-friendly sounds of corporate rock acts like Foreigner, Styx, and Journey. The popularity of disco also was keeping hard rock off the airwaves. Van Halen gave the genre a much needed shot in the arm with its hard partying anthems as well as their showmanship. Lead singer David Lee Roth was extremely charismatic, more so than any frontman in rock n' roll history, while Edward Van Halen would become the most accomplished and influential guitarist since Jimi Hendrix. Along with the solid drumming of Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony's bass playing and high pitched backing vocals, they sounded like no one at the time and while literally thousands of bands have imitated them, no hard rock band has ever had the fan rapport as the original Van Halen.<br /><br />This album remains a hard rock classic as several tracks still get played regularly on AOR radio. A loud and long horn blast opens up the album and leads into \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" with Roth's now classic charismatic showmanship and Edward's extraodinary technique. This song along with the next 3 tracks, the phenomenal guitar instrumental \\"Eruption\\", their cover of the Kinks' classic \\"You Really Got Me\\", which was better than the original, and \\"Ain't Talkin' About Love\\" remain classic rock staples over 25 years after their release. \\"I'm The One\\" is a fast paced rocker with a cool doo wop a capella vocal near its end while \\"On Fire\\" and \\"Atomic Punk\\" are relentless and continue the party atmosphere. Other great tracks include the still popular tracks \\"Jamie's Cryin\\" and \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" which feature great riffs and awesome harmonies. The atmospheric \\"Little Dreamer\\" and the rip roaring cover of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" are also top notch, further showcasing Roth's showmanship and Edward's sizzling guitar work. What you really get out of this album along with their next releases Van Halen II and Women and Children First is a band who loved what they did and didn't take things too seriously. While they would continue to make strong albums after this, the innocence that made them so appealing was lost. And once Roth left the fold in 1985, the magic was truly gone despite their continued chart success. However, Van Halen's debut remains a timeless album that never fails to entertain and should be a part of every music fan's collection.ring cover of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" are also top notch, further showcasing Roth's showmanship and Edward's sizzling guitar work.

B00000DG1R|5.0|When my 'Decade' CD from 1989 eventually gave up the ghost, I went looking for a replacement; I went one better and bought this. Taylor/Taylor/Taylor/Rhodes (Bates)/LeBon/Cucurillo et al are here to entertain you through 19 of their greatest cuts (where's the Chauffeur??) and they don't disappoint. The single edits are fine, personally I wouldn't mess with the original All She Wants Is but other than that and, I suppose, the non-chronological track listing, I can't really complain.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay's Parachutes is their debut release and remains their most subdued effort. While future albums A Rush of Blood to the Head and X&Y would mix songs of both beauty and sadness throughout, Parachutes is more somber than joyous. The album starts with \\"Don't Panic\\", a solid mid-tempo track which introduces the music world to Chris Martin's very distinctive voice, one that draws equally from both soft spoken emotion and a fairly high falsetto. The bass work of Guy Berryman is more prevalent here than on their other albums and is a highlight of the moody tracks \\"Spies\\" and \\"High Speed.\\" Jon Buckland's guitar work is solid throughout, whether it's on the hard rock of the hit single \\"Yellow\\", the memorable ringing lines of \\"Everything's Not Lost\\", or his acoustic work on \\"We Never Change\\" and \\"Sparks.\\" While the previously mentioned \\"Yellow\\" is the well known track, it's actually one of the weaker cuts, feeling like a last minute addition to get airplay. The best songs here are \\"Trouble\\", a melancholy piano ballad with a chorus that reminds you of Pink Floyd in both sound and feel, and the rocker \\"Shiver\\", a hopeful track with great lyrics, awesome guitar work from Buckland, and a passionate vocal performance from Martin. The aforementioned \\"Sparks\\", \\"We Never Change\\" and \\"Spies\\" are great tracks as well. So why not 5 stars? Well, compared to their later efforts, it's pretty tame and doesn't contain those albums' diversity, particularly on the second half. However, this is better than most of the music out now and is definitely worth the purchase.
0312995423|1.0|I sure hope that the technological errors in Digital Fortress are not a reflection of Dan Brown's research abilities. Some of the errors were so glaring that I wanted to throw the book out the window. But I'm used to seeing similar problems in movies, so I thought I'd go along for the ride. But here are some of the biggest blunders:<br /><br />1. The NSA commander wants to patch some encryption code with a backdoor and replace the version on the web with his own. This won't work because no one in security trusts code that doesn't match a hash from the original author. This is how code is authenticated. Is standard practice. His patch would cause the hash to fail. Also, everyone else who really wanted the encryption code already downloaded the original version - just like the commander did. They aren't going to get a new one. What BS!<br /><br />2. A $2B computer designed to crack codes would have separate code and data spaces in memory. It would be impossible for an encrypted communication to infect the host with a \\"virus\\" or \\"worm\\" because the communication would only be in the data memory space. Just because Microsoft doesn't use secure systems architecture doesn't mean the NSA wouldn't! More BS!<br /><br />3. No one hand-solders CPUs even if they are in a $2B computer... And especially if there are 3 million of them! It's called \\"wave soldering\\"... Brown obviously connects hand-soldering with extreme technical know-how because he later has the head computer geek hand-soldering a chip inside a running mainframe. Can you say BS!<br /><br />4. When a computer overheats, the temperature tolerance of the CPU may be exceeded by a few degrees, especially in highly sensitive, high-performance equipment. Silicon, by it's nature, changes in resistance dramatically when the temperature exceeds operational parameters. If it gets too hot, the circuits slow down. There's no way a \\"virus\\" or a \\"worm\\" could cause anything other than a system shutdown due to temperature variations - and a really sensitive system would automatically shutdown when the temperate range was exceeded by a few degrees. There's no way in heck the system would continue to run until it reached a temperature where the silicon would explode! Come on - I thought Brown did at least some research.<br /><br />If anything, these errors make me think that Lewis Perdue actually did Brown's research for Da Vinci Code - but not willingly...automatically shutdown when the temperate range was exceeded by a few degrees.

B0007XH5OY|5.0|I highly recommend this version with the extra tracks.   The sound is excellent.     I hear a lot more than on the Remastered Epic version.     And I really like the bonus cuts.   I think I prefer the alternate versions than the ones used for the record, especially Blues DeLuxe.    The definitive version!!    A must have for your collection.

0790729628|2.0|As impressive as this movie seemed in the early '80s, \\"Blade Runner\\" depends on too many trends from that era to take seriously now. The lighting and set design were meant to evoke '40s Film Noir but now remind me of an over-produced MTV video. The acting is of the less-will-seem-like-more-when-it-really-isn't school that Robert DeNiro inspired. And except for the schmaltzy \\"Tannhauser Gate\\" soliloquy, the only memorable line of dialogue is \\"Give me more life ... f***er.\\"  <br /> <br />Worth a rental to take a trip down memory lane, but not worth your money.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Monday, June 13, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Defense of the agri-community<br /><br />Going back through the Miyazaki catalogue after Spirited Away, Mononoke, and Lupin I hit Nausicaa first.  Like the prior mentioned two, this is another 5 star effort with nature and personal growth at its heart.  A young girl, a princess, attempts to save her peaceful agri-centered valley from twin dangers.  The industrial complex of a warring nation and the monstrous slug like insects that are treated as apocalyptic harbingers.  As usual, a young beau is thrown into the mix and they must rely on their wits and inner courage to save the day.  Sweeping once again with glider rides and war machines of the air, Nausicaa doesn't disappoint.  Highly recommended.
0887307280|5.0|I live in Lima, Peru, South America, and I have noticed that Gerber's concepts are also applicable here... Of course it could be a little more difficult to do and also we needed to adapt some of his views, but, in most part, they are very USEFUL AND MOTIVATING TOO... Thanks Mr. Gerber... I dream to have you here in my country to teach us more things...!
B0006L16N8|5.0|You don't have to lecture to me about the value of reinvention. I think Kid A by Radiohead is the most important record in modern music, PERIOD! I also listen to Beck, an artist who reinvents almost for the sake of it. However, even Beck capitalized off of what he did right on Odelay to make Guero, and it was a great success. The same with X & Y. If it works, don't knock it. X & Y isn't the most original album, but it's a powerhouse work. The title track, Twisted Logic, Speed of Sound, and Talk are all very powerful, and emotionally charged pieces, and much can be said for the rest of the album. I'm so glad they did this, verses the possibility of reinventing themselves, and failing misreably. So, yes, pretty much every song here is a string-augmented embellishment of the mechanisms that made \\"Clocks\\" a great song. But it's still the best release of 2005, I'd say.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Won by one was a decent record but far too evident of the amount of time they spent on it. consequently, i've listened to it maybe twice. but the truth is im just prone to like what Grohl does. Being a huge Nirvana fan i liked the solo stuff that heard before it became the first Foo record. No argument with numerous posts that Color and the Shape was and is thier best record. yeah... and? Nothing   Left to Lose had some great songs too, Won by one sorta hit and miss.....  Should they quit? bands have to write new material to survive and sometimes its not as good. Thats being in a band. You like the new stuff or not? Won by one wasn't that great. oh well.. they tried and in my opinion, failed. Wait til the next one. If creativity could be forced everyone would be a star. This band is neither ground breaking nor do they claim to be. They are a rock band and happily reside under that label in a glass jar with all contents totally visible for what they are.   In my opinion, this record is evident the amount of time spent on it. Best opening track, too. That line..\\"can you hear me?!\\" how friggin big and bad ass is that?  The quality of songs, the double CD epic thing, totally works. I will admit there are not that many stand out tracks, so to speak. No real singles in comparison to \\"everlong\\" or \\"generator\\" or \\"breakout\\".. Its really a mood type of record. Yet unlike Won by One, the slow affection grows. In alot of ways, this record reminds me of the first one. no song is totally amazing, but you like every one. Personally, i fine the last heavy song, \\"end over end\\" kinda boring but thats me. the slow CD has a song very similar to \\"something in the way\\" by Nirvana but it doesnt really bother me. Just something i noticed. Again, they've written better slow songs, but this is still a great record. Its just not single oriented material but I find myself returning for another listen every day. The pairing of a loud cd and soft cd....great! its a branch out, somewhat. sorta different but sorta the same. Different package but same gift... thats cool. not unexpected from these guys and offers something i think fans can always rely on... them being them.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho    Another inspiring and uplifting fable type story about a young man following his dreams. A country boy becomes a shepherd because he wants to travel and see new places in the countryside of Andalusia. Then he dreams of riches to be found in the Pyramids of Egypt.     All the while the book makes the reader think about many ideas or seeds of success. There must have been 25 positive seeds or ideas that are worth writing down as you come across them.     When I read a book that I truly enjoy and it mentions another book I always jot it down and pick it up. This often sets up a chain of events that leads to one great book after another. Sometimes the chain goes 3,4 or even 5 books deep.  I ended up at the Alchemist this way. It started out like this:    Berkshire Hathaway's letter to shareholders by Warren Buffett  then   The Smartest Guys in the Room   then   The Fountainhead and the Alchemist          Glad I ended up here!

B0009A1AS2|3.0|Well, 1st off, lets be clear that the rating can only be compared with another DT album, as this album will get 10 stars out of five if compared to some mainstream rock/pop/metal albums. <br />One more thing, I do not rate an album because it has one or 2 killer tracks, but how the album as a whole come through... <br />Here are my ratings for previous DT albums: <br /> <br />1. WDADU - 2.5/5 [YTSE rocks] <br />2. I&W   - 4.75/5 [started it all] <br />3. Awake - 4.5/5 <br />4. ACOS[EP]- 4.75/5 [Well, the title track is the only track here, other covers are just bonuses] <br />5. FII   - 2.5/5 <br />6. MP2/SFAM - 4.5/5 [stupid lyrics only downer] <br />7. SDOIT - 4.9/5 [could've been a tad heavier] <br />8. TOT - 4/5 [heavy enough but lacks depth] <br /> <br />Now, lets analyze Octavarium song by song and as a whole: <br /> <br />1. Root of all evil : Solid DT <br />2. The Answer Lies Within : not good enough on its own, but necessary evil(?) for the flow of the album. On any other album (except for Falling..), DT would've cut this song to 2 minutes as a bridge. <br />3. These Walls : Okay DT, a bit predictable, nothing new  <br />4. I Walk Beside You : Its time for DT to lip sync on MTV (This song is probably the best pop song EVER, as well as WORST DT EVER, worst than 'you not me' <br />5. Panic Attack : Thumbs up <br />6. Never Enough : Starts off pretty good, then gets boring and predictable, cliche lyrics, after 20 listens, u'll skip to the next track <br />7. Sacrificed Sons : one of the best songs by DT, takes a few listens to sink in <br />8. Octavarium : Well, this is a refreshing adventure by DT, one of the best structured songs I've ever heard, catchy as hell and still fresh after many listens. Dream theater are listening to more classical music I guess. This song reminds me of 'Stairway to Heaven' - nothing similar but the mood: starts of slow with folk influence, gets harder and harder, eventually reaches the ecstasy, then the symphonic marvel at abouth20+ minute, petrucci makes his guitar cry (One of the most traditional yet emotional solos ever performed by the living guitar legend) and the flute fade out at the end... what can I say, It will blow every one away. Dream Theaters one the best lyrics ever. <br /> <br />Okay, now comes scoring: <br /> <br />1. Musicianship : 4.5/5 <br />2. Vocals : 4.5/5 (I used to hate Labrie, but he has grown immensely, this album is the testament) <br />3. Structure : 5/5 (DT-s best till date) <br />4. Free of Fillers/Commercial tracks : 1/5 (This is where the  album looses my respect, too much pop and predictability :( <br />5. Creativity : 4.5/5 (After 15 years of existence, DT can still deliver the goods, and fresh ones too, something new and something they haven't done b4) <br />6. Reviewer's Tilt : 2.5/5 (this 76 minute album could've been cut short to 40 minutes and it would have been much better w/out the tracks #3, #4, #6) <br /> <br />End SCORE: 3.5/5
B0009HLDFU|3.0|While this is a big step up from their last cd, the Foo Fighters are definitely not back to the level at which their first 3 albums were. The tunefulness is lacking; some of the riffs are exactly the same as riffs from previous albums; and even though there are 20 songs spanning 2 discs, there's a distinct lack of ambition. I'm rarely the type to dissect double albums to say \\"boy wouldn't it be great if only the best ten or twelve had been selected to make one great album,\\" but this is definitely a case for it. A mix between the best of the first and second discs could have created a rock-solid cd, copy-protection or not. (By the way, the same strategy of rock disc/softer disc was used a few years ago by Paul Westerberg on his latterday masterpiece \\"Stereo/Mono\\" to much greater effect.)<br /><br />So, my conclusion about this album is that it's good but not great, interesting in spots, inspired in spots. After 3 great albums and one semi-clunker, I was left wondering what would come next for this band. In Your Honor doesn't really answer one way or another, so it seems it could go either way. Let's hope for a more focused effort next time out.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Yes, at first few listens, this album came to me as the ultimate letdown. after becoming an instant fan after the powerhouses of STST and WTF, this release looked like the ultimate letdown. overly nasal singing(most prominent in Bat Country), no screaming, poor song strucure, corny lyrics...all the ingredients for a disaster. <br />yet i remembered that i did not like STST for the first few listens too. <br />likewise, this release has to be savoured like wine. listen a few more times, even as background music. and u will find yourself humming to Seize the Day and tapping your feet to Strength of the World. Even M.I.A. becomes immensely listenable. <br />Yes, this album is not the one we expected. But it comes nothing close of being the Train of Thought of Dream Theater and St Anger of Metallica. come on, its just a less impressive album. many bands out there cannot even come up with this on a good day. <br />listen more, judge well, and hope for a more impressive future release.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|there are other ways to copy the cd to your computer, i know at least 5 different ways i can get around the copy right protection.  one of them being downloading the cd, but the others take awhile and are kinda hard to explain.  but anyway this is a really good effort from the foos, i don't support copyright protection because i usually just copy my cds to the computer from windows media player and when that doesnt work ill find some other way todo it.  this is probably there best work since there self-titled, and colour and the shape which in my opinion is still there best cd.  at first i didnt think this is there heaviest cd but in foo retrospective it is.  its not like death metal or anything but theres some great guitar work by dave grohl on this disc, just takes a few listens to really appreciate this album.  please support the foo's and buy this disc, its really worth the $10.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS -the one and only, June 14, 2005<br /><br />Reviewer: James M. Hawk (columbus, ohio United States) - See all my reviews<br /><br />I do not know whether to be mad or happy. I think this might just be the 3rd go around? for this movie. mad!, why does it take these companies 2,3,4,5 times to get it right?. DOUBLE DIPPING and GREED. this time however it appears that they finally have done it justice. the movie is the same as the 25thyr edition and they have included FULL details that were shortened on the 25th edition. the films presentation is the same but why couldn't they try to remastered it again(try to cleanup the GRAIN that can be seen). very interesting bonus features with details about on set and filming. if you have any other(s) editions of this movie--you may want to keep them anyway. some minor features did not transfer to this updated version(important?)--not really but completists take note. also, this is a minor quibble by this reviewer. in the 25th edition you got a 4 page booklet keepsake in 1st flap of dvd the 4 page booklet really contains nothing but scene selections and with this new one, you do not have the keepsake--HOWEVER: they do give you a very nice 60 pg booklet which is what we all wanted anyway. I kept my booklet and transferred it to the upgrade(I just like having as much as possible). I just get so disappointed when companies give us stuff and then when we upgrade-the stuff is gone. *I am sure the movie companies have major and minor trinkets that they could have given us(souvenirs)when the film was originally released. the price for this reissue is affordable, but I for one--would not hesitate to pay more if they had more to give us. I guess, there will be for 35th edition, 40th, 45th, oh, and lets not forget the ULTIMATE EDITION on the 50th--etc.........
B0009OPO0S|4.0|Overall the CD is OK, now if we talk about La Tortura, now that's music, and the video is great, it's soo erotic, the other sons are kinna good, but just La tortura and the video makes it worth it, the rest of the DVD is boring and Alejandro Sans seems pushy and cheesy!.  Arriba las Divas latinas!!
B00008G9JM|5.0|Jeez, how do you tackle a 500 pound gorilla?  Very carefully, with eyes (yea, the third one too) and ears wide open!  This gorilla has an eye-patch, wears a tutu and wants to discuss Voltaire, Nietzsche and Kant (with a nice bottle of scotch and a cigar).  He's an impressive beast, but has a scary asymmetry and might lull you into a menacing corner of Tulldom that might jade one forever.  I have always been pretty content with the tribe of plain old monkeys (of the usual TULL songs).  The times I CRANK IT UP and play guitar, bass or drums to it, the energy of the album bowls me over and it can do no wrong.  It's exciting steppin' out with the gorillas.  This could almost be described as the \\"musician's album\\" of the line-up - musicians will certainly want to study the great ideas explored here.  There are brilliant and powerful passages throughout that equal Thick easily, but somehow (at other times) it can seem kind of flat in a melodic/harmonic sense, I guess gorillas don't sing quite as sweetly.  I consider myself to be a prog old-timer and have explored the genre substantially, and this is one of the masterpieces for sure (listening to the first few minutes could tell you that), but it has a strange brew of ideas that sometimes don't gel totally.  I'll admit that I've always found the Hare story to be a bit of an intrusion and too long...although somewhat charming in its own right (I have kids - they should have made a children's prog album!).  The storyline has never taken my mind's eye to the great song-writing landscapes of many other great TULL songs (that's the tutu on the gorilla).  My weakness for this album is all about powerful, and I mean POWERFUL playing of this great line-up of TULL.  Man, are they smokin' in spots (eye-patch)!<br /><br />This is certainly a treasured piece of the intricate TULL puzzle...figure it out if you can (Kant and Nietzsche are puzzling as well).  Otherwise, just bang your drums or hammer your guitar until your tendons snap.  Nice work-out tape!  The real BENEFIT of being a TULL fan is the incredible diversity and uniqueness of each album.  They are all great in their own way.  In this tribe, gorillas and the more diminutive breeds live in musical harmony.  Thank you TULL for adding so much to the musical fabric (and rockin' my obviously devolved world - us neanderTULLs can't get enough).  Go buy if you like a King Kong sized challenge - I do (booklet includes lyrics great track notes/pictures, comments by IA, etc. - about 45 minutes of high-flyin'TULL)!work-out tape!

B000002LRX|4.0|\\"...a commercial lapse from which they never quite recovered.\\" This is a quote concerning the popularity of FNM after the release of Angel Dust. Blah, blah, blah. It's undeniably their best CD. It's a great disc when every single song is memorable and fun, along with excellent musicianship and Patton's voice. I never get tired of this cd. From thrash to funk rock to gospel sounding vox, this cd is amazing! Buy it!
B00006JKOM|5.0|O.K., this may not be auto-biographical - the pied piper pulled you...the mad biker fooled you! I don't know folks, this may be the only non-gold album of the 70's, but this wonderful selection of TULL songs just seem to grow on me as I get older. I was more into the heavier TULL albums in the past, but this more atmospheric & psychedelic TULL is SO enjoyable (one reason I love Minstrel). And by the way, many of these songs ROCK!<br /><br />Check out that guitar in Quizz Kid, Crazed Institution, Taxi Grab, Big Dipper, The Pied Piper (Strip Cartoon - GREAT EXTRA), etc. This is John Glascock's first bass outing with TULL, he and Barlow are kickin' up the dust, John Evan adds his usual depth and magic - this is one great album! I also think Ian had one hell of a concept here ... this could have made an excellent stage production - it is very clever and well-crafted (and just sounds plain old TRIPPY!). All members are near the top of their game it appears to me, and I know all of these albums like the back of my hand.<br /><br />Look where this sits in the stretch ... smack in the middle of TULL paradise. Shame on many of you (TULL fans) for dismissing this album after only a few listens, sometimes the stealth albums come back and 'knock you upside the head' with their brilliance later when they've matured in your subconscious (one of the most melodic TULL albums).<br /><br />Listen to some of the songs like Chequered Flag, Deadbeat, Too Old and Big Dipper - melodic, shimmering, beautiful, poetic and really spacy! Salamander would give John Renbourn a run for his money, that's a snazzy song my friends! Bad Eyed & Loveless, Pied Piper and From a Deadbeat to an Old Greaser sound so cool with their slowed-down lilting psychedelic (reverb soaked) charm...<br /><br />OH YEAH, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL FOR LOVERS OF CLASSIC TULL! If you love Minstrel especially, you should appreciate this. No, you're never too old to rock 'n' roll if you're too young to die. I know the real world keeps many people too busy, but take the time to really listen to good music...CRANK IT UP - ENJOY!!<br /><br />P.S. Small Cigar is also a nice addition, funny song - and I guess it's not (or is it?) about the rolled non-tobacco type. Nice remastering job (and packaging) with lyrics, good track notes and comments by Ian (just under 50 minutes - sniff).but take the time to really listen to good music...CRANK IT UP - ENJOY!!

B00005YU1O|4.0|I have been teaching a Basic Design class for over 5 years and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has been a part of my curriculum to the present.  Why am I mentioning this Disney classic?  Because there are correlations between Waking Life and the infamous, \\"Sleeping Death\\" in Snow White, missed by most if not all of these reviews. <br />I think everyone is anxious about the issues concerning death through faith and philosophy and they miss some crucial points from Waking Life. <br />The first, the medium itself.  Snow White was Disneys' first full length feature animation film and it used a film/animation process called Rotoscope.  This is where the realistic characters like Snow White, the Prince and Evil Princess were all modeled after live action footage.  This is also used in Waking Life through a more contemporary digital process created by the animator while attending the MIT media lab.  So the medium is the first correlation.   <br />Next, the message (if you will):  Snow White is full of issues concerning gender roles, sexuality, aging, work ethic, purity, faith, death and so forth.  These are deep and troubling aspects of life generalized or simplified in Snow White. Disney's contrivence from the sexually and socially charged Brothers' Grimm fairytale creates more disturbing ideals concerning conformity to social norms (i.e. gender roles; women home/men at work; beauty/vanity). Also,notice the number of writers who worked on the film in the closing credits.  This alone raises some speculation on these issues and how to draw [sic] these ideals up.   <br />Why does this matter?  Look and discover all the loose ends in Waking Life.  Mysteries revealing only more mysteries.  Nothing is pinned down and this flows througout the neo-phychedellic animation like levels of moving water.  Life can't be held and understood. And here in Waking Life, death is sought along with life.  \\"Sleeping Death\\" in Snow White is somehow an avoidance of life's terms, the end.  Not really dying, just sleeping and awaiting the \\"...life, happily everafter\\".  Where at least Waking Life confronts death as an awakening and a continuum of learning like life can be.  Anyone who sees this movie and barks 'psuedo-philosophy' is attempting to pin life and death down.  Waking Life is just a movement through space in an aesethically pleasing way. <br />Believe me, these questions and philosophical meanderings are by far more enertaining than the fill and fluff of countless long songs in Snow White.  Count the length of songs vs. story/action in Snow White, it's unbearable at times. <br />I give this movie  Four Stars, understanding how these countless questions can burden ones' mind.  However, the animation gets Five.  Oh, believe me, I know there is more to write and even discuss between these two animation classics.
0452283760|5.0|Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" sent my world spinning. Though, I was never into reading novels, just reading 5 pages of the book made me crazy to read it in one sit. Howard Roark is my idol. I don't know how world defines objectivity, but the way Ayn Rand did in her epic is beyond words.  <br /> <br />The words don't do justice to Ayn Rand's work. I learnt lots of things from the book and am very grateful to Ayn Rand for bringing the book to light.  <br /> <br />There cannot be another book like this in this world for the time to come.
B000000WA4|5.0|First off, I'd have to say this was the smashing pumpkins best effort, and quite possibly my favorite cd for various reasons on which upon I shall state. First reason the guitar. If you even think of being a muscisian this is an esential listen. I never realized the complexity of billy corgans musical vocabulary until i heard this. Second reason the number of single and possible singles,  <br /> <br />Standout Tracks <br /> <br />> Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness <br />> Zero <br />> Bullet With Butterfly Wings <br />> Muzzle <br />> Porcelina <br />> Bodies  <br />> 1979 <br /> <br />These are my favorite, plus james iha does a nice song, and finally the Third Reason, What you wouldnt expect, i really didnt expect it to sound like it did (on a good way) it is a masterpiece at it lows, but at the peaks it is undescribable for words.
B0009PVZWI|4.0|Another fine work by Dave and crew.  A lot of good tunes, with a few gems, especially on disc 2.  Unfortunately most of it sounds like stuff they've done before.  But what band who has put out several albums ever does anything avant-garde?  It is well worth the money if you are a Foo Fighters fan, just don't expect to be amazed and thrilled with the entire album like you were with their first two albums.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie is will Ferrell at his finest. From the opening credits he plays the bumbling anchorman known as Ron Burgundy in perfect form. When you buy this movie it will be for Will Ferrell's genius, he creates a character who is not simply a humorous idiot (that part is played by Steve Carell) but has motivation, sorrow, and even wit at times.  The dialog and writing on this movie is brilliant, the lines aren't ridiculously cheesy or over the top stupid for sake of being funny. By the same token it doesn't feel as if every line reads like it took a conglomeration of 10 minds 30 minutes to create it.     Throughout it all Ferrell stays the man with below average IQ who is attempting to win his newfound love Veronica Corningstone and retain his job.     Great cast, great writing, thank you Will Ferrell.

B00001NFMF|4.0|Anyone familiar with the signature Tull sound is in for a surprise with this album. \\"This Was\\" occupies a unique place in the band's discography, as it is their only true blues-rock record. Much of this is to be credited to the influence of Mick Abrahams (guitar), who always leaned towards this style. But it's also true that there were dozens of British bands exploring the blues field at that time. Your attitude towards blues-rock perfectly defines whether you'll like this album, or not, as the material itself is quite good. <br /> <br />I find it surprising that the level of the songs on \\"This Was\\" is so unexpectedly high for a debut album of a band that was almost constantly shifting its line-up in its early phase of existence. There are many impressive tracks on the album, but I'd like to mention \\"Some Day The Sun Won't Shine For You\\", and \\"It's Breaking Me Up\\". An instrumental \\"Serenade To A Cuckoo\\" is noteworthy, as it was written by a jazz flutist Roland Kirk, whose style of playing influenced Ian Anderson much. It's also known as the first flute tune that Anderson learned to play. \\"This Was\\" gives Ian's soon-to-be-famous flute a lot of playing time, while Mick Abrahams' bluesy guitar provides a good counterpoint. You can feel these two men rivalling for the band leadership, the battle that Ian won, and Mick lost, and left Tull for a band called Blodwyn Pig. His departure was mainly the reason for Jethro Tull losing their bluesy edge and leaning more towards folk music on future albums. <br /> <br />Surely, the album is not without its flaws, the completely unnecessary drum solo on \\"Dharma For One\\" being the most painful of them. But to any Tull fan this album comes highly recommended, as it shows the little known nature of this band, the one that doesn't show itself on any other JT album. And the sound quality is surprisingly good, too!

B0006L16N8|5.0|You know what? Coldplay's biggest, smart-ass critics always state that their music is safe & even, sort of listener-friendly, without taking too many risks. Well, that's just right with me. Their newest, X&Y is by far the most enjoyable album released this year. Great tunes, meaningful lyrics, and swell production. A delightful improvement on previous albums, which were 3 1/2 & 4 stars with me. Money very well spent.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|They finally did it! Everyone has been waiting for a great DVD release of perhaps one of the Greatest movies of all time. Now it's here. It truly is an Ultimate Edition. If you have been waiting for the perfect edition of Dawn of the Dead This is it. Even if you own all the other editions on DVD, VHS, or Laser you need to pick the one up. You will be happy that you did.
B00097A5I6|1.0|This album is so bad it's beyond words. Honest to God, being an avid fan of there Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory albums, I tried as hard as I could to accept this new release, but I simply couldn't force myself to listen to it more than twice. It is horrid & pathetic, and obviously, these lads from Manchester should quit while they further tarnish their jaded reputation.
B000066744|5.0|I am a singer/songwriter and I play the piano.  And this movie took my breath away.  Not only did TIM ROTH \\"PLAY\\" that part.....I believed that he was actually \\"1900\\", but the music was such that anyone with ANY appreciation for music had to fall in love with it immediately.  Upon accidentally catching the movie on TV, I immediately purchased the DVD and Soundtrack.  A little disappointed that some of the key songs in the movie were not included on the US version only containing 21 tracks, I found one overseas that had 29 tracks....that's all I listen to everyday.  Would I recommend this movie to others?  I have recommeded it  to EVERYONE.  And they have all fallen in love with it as I did.  If you love music, especially piano you HAVE to see this movie.....and if you were not a TIM ROTH fan, prior to seeing THE LEGEND OF 1900....you will definitely be one afterwards.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|This album is in short a recap of all of Shania's best hits over the years, and hence there is nothing spectacular about the tunes -- well-known and fun. Some of the songs are very worth reminiscing (Man! I feel like a Woman!, Up!, You're Still The One). Some great new ones are Party For Two, among others. The album is very nice, a good one to listen to on the way home.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was in a brick-and-mortar store today and had this album in one hand and a twenty dollar bill in the other.  After realizing that I couldn't rip the CD to my ipod or run it on a computer without bogging my system down with bloatware, I quickly opted to add some cash and buy a video game instead.   <br /> <br />Way to go RIAA.  You just cost yourselves a sale.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Even though there already are a million other reviews for this album I feel the need to add my 2 cents.  Basically this album seems hit or miss so I will break down each song individually to start. <br /> <br />1.  Root of all Evil 9/10 - The album starts on a very strong note.  This song is very well written, pretty heavy with the keys adding a cool atmosphere.  Good chorus, but not great which would have given this song a perfect score. <br /> <br />2. The Answer Lies Within 5/10 - Not a bad song but really nothing special.  Sounds like they forced it and the result is really boring and predictable.  Sure it's easy to pick on the ballad but this is not Another Day, Surrounded, or Lifting Shadows. <br /> <br />3. Tear Down These Walls 8/10 - Very Good song.  The keys are swarming and sound like something of recent In Flames.  Easily the best chorus on the album as well. <br /> <br />4. I Walk Beside You 4/10 - Not sure why DT felt the need to do a U2 song?  Save it for a side project!  Again not a terrible song but nothing remotely good and a wasted slot. <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack 7/10 - Nice heavy riffs and frantic pace. A song that sounds pretty fresh and inspired.  Too bad they forgot to include a good chorus for this one. <br /> <br />6. Never Enough 8/10 - Cool frantic riffs again.  Again a fairly inspired song like Panic Attack but with a slightly better chorus. <br /> <br />7. Sacrificed Sons 6/10 - Pretty stagnant song.  A long 6 min acoustic part that never really goes anywhere.  Sure in kicks in about 6 minutes into the song but by that time I am already asleep. <br /> <br />8. Octavarium 5/10 - A 24 minute song for the sake of a 24 minute song I guess.  The song has about 6-7 minutes of material stretched out over 24 minutes.  They pulled it off with Change of Seasons but failed miserably here. <br /> <br />Overall there are some good ideas but the song writing on this album is watered down and incomplete.  Maybe these guys need to refocus on this band and steer clear of all the side projects.  They obviously have not lost any talent but their creativeness and insperation seems to have been lost.  It looks like Dream Theater will never be able to match the magic of Images and Words or Awake.   <br /> <br />I really had high expectations for this album.  Maybe it was because of the real cool artwork, or because of the fact I thought TOT was there best effort since Awake and maybe these guys could improve on that.  Maybe next time.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately with TOT, most people just whined that it was too heavy instead of just listening to the material underneath which was very solid and inspired.  Maybe DT listened to all of these whiners and tryed too hard to please everybody with this album. <br /> <br />Also, why where the reins so tight on Petrucci's leads?  Man this guy can still shred as heard on TOT.  John, us musicans want to hear you play that axe not be restrained by it. <br /> <br />I will conclude this review on a totally unrelated note: <br /> <br />Pull Me Under - still the best song ever created!!!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The Foo Fighters have a long history now of bringing us awesome music, plugged-in and chock full with screaming guitars and the very best of lyrics. With their fifth album, In Your Honor, this group does not fail to disappoint us! The CD rocks hard and yet offers us many otherworldly, soft and thoughtful lyrics. Foo Fighter fans are going to be really pleased with a generous 2 CD set that will leave you yelling and begging-for more!<br /><br />The first CD of the two CD set REALLY rocks hard and hits the ground running with two awesome songs, \\"In Your Honor\\" and \\"No Way Back.\\" The title track, \\"In Your Honor,\\" starts off with the incredible lyrics \\"Can You Hear Me/Hear Me Screaming?\\" Mind blowing lyrics on this title track, guys! It grabs the listener and pulls them right into the right frame of mind for this awesome two CD set! \\"No Way Back\\" almost seems to flow out of \\"In Your Honor\\" to give us a one-two punch of POW! that makes you already anxious for more! \\"DOA\\" and \\"Free Me\\" are also two more songs that really rock! Look for it! \\"The Last Song\\" is about the ending of a love with raw emotion and \\"Resolve\\" has a great rhythm; and there's a really interesting track called \\"Resolve.\\" \\"Resolve\\" goes at a slightly slower pace, especially for the first CD of this set, but make no mistake-this is a true rock song with feeling, depth and soul. \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" is one of my favorite songs here-the raw emotion is so in your face; this must have taken courage to write. The first CD ends strong with the track called \\"End Over End.\\" A must have for Foo Fighters fans and fans of great rock everywhere!<br /><br />The exceptionally great thing about this two CD set is that the Foo Fighters have worked so incredibly hard to create a whole extra second CD that clearly demonstrates their versatility and unique talent. While the first CD rocks hard and strong, the second CD is more mellow and acoustic. Nevertheless, it is no less fascinating and enjoyable! The first track on the second CD is entitled \\"Still.\\" \\"Still\\" is a beautiful, more acoustic track that from the very beginning leads us into a stark contrast to the first CD although the thoughtful lyrics and honesty are still very much there! Talk about a band being able to do it all! Hehehe Indeed, the song \\"Miracle\\" has, at the beginning, an introductory musical arrangement that very vaguely sounds like the band called America! \\"Miracle\\" is a triumphant, joyous yet peaceful song, a true ballad in every sense of the word. The two songs \\"Friend Of A Friend\\" and \\"Over And Out\\" are especially thoughtful and passionate. \\"Virginia Moon\\" and \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\" have impressive musical arrangements, too. And how's about that song, \\"Another Round?\\" It offers a special and creative mix of harmonium, harp, and mandolin. \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\" also has Taylor Hawkins doing lead vocals. With the final track, \\"Razor,\\" the music is soft and peaceful, especially at the beginning. Nevertheless, this is a strong song to end the double album, involving confrontation and honesty about a relationship.<br /><br />The Foo Fighters include Dave Grohl (vocals, guitar, drums); Taylor Hawkins (vocals, drums); Chris Shiflett (guitar); Nate Mendel (bass instrument). They also work very well with their peers on this two CD set; and this enhances the quality of the outcome. Look for such greats as Norah Jones on both vocals and piano; Josh Homme and Joe Beebe helping out on guitar; John Paul Jones working the mandolin and the piano; Petra Haden playing violin; Danny Clinch on harmonica; Rami Jaffe on keyboards; and Nick Raskulinecz playing both double bass and bass guitar.<br /><br />All in all, this rather impressive two CD set, In Your Honor shows that a tough as nails musical strike and skillful songwriting do not have to be separated in any way. The Foo Fighters brings us a generous double CD set that once again proves their unique talent, versatility and brilliance. This is a golden nugget shining brightly, folks! Foo Fighters, great job-and give us more very soon, please!shining brightly, folks! Foo Fighters, great job-and give us more very soon, please!  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|The movie is worth it, and you can get your DVD fixed. Dreamworks will replace it for free with one with good subtitling, if you go to gofishpictures.com/GITS2 there is a form to fill out to replace the less desirable disc.
B000002KOY|5.0|Essential!  It will bring a big smile to your face.  You will be amazed at how great the original version of \\"Downtown\\" sounds compared to Neil's later version.  This album has an authentic Cajun flavor on some tracks which reminds me of The Band a little.  Do not put this on your \\"someday when I get around to it\\" list.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I see no reason why I have to buy music twice - once for my stereo and again for my iPod.  I will not do it.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have been an avid Dream Theater fan for many years, however I was always a little disappointed with the lack of 'feeling' in their music. As has been mentioned many times before, songs suffered at the expense of displaying technical skill and crazy time signs. Don't get me wrong, I like both these things, however prefer them entwined in good melodies, and songs that actually mean something. <br />This offering from Dream Theater gives me the impression that finally I think that they have learned to balance their music. <br />In particular, I am really happy to hear real strings - finally! Another well-awaited feature is that of more interesting bass lines (not all emphasis on the guitar and keyboards), and more depth in the vocals. In fact, I feel as though the music in general has more depth (particularly when compared with the most recent album Train Of Thought). <br />The title track really surprised and impressed me - it has not fallen into the trap that SDOIT fell into (i.e. just a whole heap of bits of music stuck together that don't really flow that well). This track has that 'feeling' I talked about above, mixed in with prog rock elements (of course), and some classic Dream Theater style melodies. <br />In all, this album has resurrected DT from the slums I sent them to after the disappointing TOT - and I finally feel as though they have evolved into the next phase of their music.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This CD is great.  It seems that the Foos have gone back to some previous sounds pre-One by One era.  And I am a big fan of One by One, although not many are.  I was so excited that this was going to be a 2 CD set.  Although I am more of a fan of their harder stuff, it is nice to have a whole cd of softer songs to listen to.  It will take me a few more listens to fully open up to the second disc.  The First disc is amazing and is up to par with previous records.  I think that Dave is a great song writer and the Foos are one of the best rock acts out there. <br /> <br />All you people whining about copy protection, what happened to listening to a CD in a CD player, like people did a whole 3 years ago.  Screw putting everything on I-Pods.  Listening to an actual CD is better than an mp3 anyday.  It is sad when people give reviews on copy-protection and not an actual album. <br />
B000065V42|3.0|nice family movie...fun spirited..good character development...unrealistic drown/rescue scene--teen girl near drowns in muddy water--teen boy does rescue dives searching for her--he finds her pulls her out and does a few rounds of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and she is perfectly fine and completely recovers
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I saw this twice in the theater - and for what we pay nowadays for tickets that's about the best review I can write. This movie was visually stirring and was the topic of conversation as we exited the theater and several hours after. See it for the 'Gabriel' character alone!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|This review comes late, but having recently heard the Riesman piano CD of the same soundtrack, and reviewing it, I feel that I should offer my take on the original. The 'new' piano version has made me realise how much I find this recording to be one of Mr Glass's most emotionally charged pieces, and a fitting accompaniment to a magnificent film.  <br />A combination of rich string arrangements and Michael Riesman's piano provide a pulsating, melodic and poignant soundtrack that made all the difference to the movie. Everything seems very restrained, yet everything is powerful in the music - there is a sense of drive and purpose that arises from gentle beginnings. Five stars. <br /> <br />
6305558167|5.0|As many reviewers have commented Excalibur stands out as the best movie based on the Arthurian legend. This movie traces the whole arc of the myth from the origin of Excalibur, Merlin, the circumstances of the birth of Arthur to him becoming King, Camelot and the Round Table, the betrayal of Arthur by Lancelot and Guenevere, the downfall of Camelot, Morgana and Mordred, the quest of the Grail, to the final climatic battle scene and the returning of Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Director John Boorman and the adaptation of the Thomas Malory tale by Rospo Pallenberg embraces the myth instead of trying to impose modern sensibilities on the story. This is in contrast to the recent Hollywood movies that use mythical tales or history, for example Stone's Alexander, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, and the recent Arthur movies, Fuqua's Arthur, or Last Knight, which have fallen flat because of the director and/or screen writer instead of treating the subject and tale with respect imposed a modern lens on the story or eliminated the mysticism and spirituality from the tales. There are many fascinating aspects to this movie. I thought how the movie wonderfully portrays a world in flux between pantheistism and Christianity. You have the pagan aspects with Merlin, Morgana, the magical elements of the movie, the allegory of the Dragon, and the linkage between the spiritual state of King Arthur and the prosperity of the kingdom. When Arthur is first King the land is full of life and prosperous but after he falls into despair the land becomes barren with clouded skies, leaveless trees and death is everywhere. After Arthur drinks from the Holy Grail and his soul is replished by the grace of God you see when he rides out with the remnants of his knights the land is becoming alive again with trees flowering under a sunny sky. You also a world changing with the rise of Christianity. You see priests and monks, characters wearing crucifixes, the spartan chapel at Camelot, Guenevere becoming a nun and entering a convent after her adultery, the quest for the Grail, and Lancelot becoming a monk like character in the wilderness. Merlin himself alludes to this changing world talking about the One God replacing the many gods and his age is ending and the age of man beginning. One sees this theme repeated in Tolkein's Lord of the Ring trilogy with the age of the pantheistic magical elves ending being replaced by the age of men. <br />   The movie does not shy away from the moral play of the legend. Acts of lust for power and sex end in tragedy for Uther, Lancelot and Guenevere, and even Morgana. One sees how the power of despair overcomes Arthur and almost destroys the soul of Perceval who is able to discover the Grail when he keeps hope and faith alive and only when he is able to release his bonds to the material world. (When watching the scene where he falls into the river, takes off his armor and is only wearing a white undergarment I was thinking this is an analogy of baptism and spiritual renewal.) One sees the power of forgiveness and love and how this act enables Arthur to defeat evil incarnate in Moored. Arthur does not kill Lancelot and Guenevere when he had a chance thus saving Excalibur. This act of mercy plays a key role later in the movie because Guenevere keeps Excalibur and gives it to Arthur when he comes to her to offer her his forgiveness and Lancelot comes back for the final battle to help save the kingdom from evil and he is reconciled with Arthur. <br />   The movie does not shy away from realism too. The plated armor the knights wear were not used until the late medieval period although this adds to the mythical world Boorman created one sees the brutish nature of hand to hand combat with knights struggling to fight in the mud and muck. This is not some glamorized form of medieval warfare. <br />   From an acting viewpoint Nicol Williamson as Merlin and Helen Mirren as Morgana steal the show. Nicol Williamson fully embraces Merlin inhis humor, wisdom, foreboding, manipulating events, and sad realization that the fallen nature of man will always thwart his best efforts. Helen Mirren is diabolical good as Morgana embracing her sexuality, and lust for power and revenge. Nigel Terry as Arthur gives a good performance first as a simple squire confused about what to do when he discovers his true heritage, to a King trying to rule a kingdom with wisdom while trying to be a husband, to his despair and spiritual renewal. As commented before one sees now famous actors in early roles from Gabriel Byrne playing Arthur's father Uther in the opening scenes, to Patrick Stewart as Leondegrance in full armor and yielding a battle axe Grimli from LOTR would be proud of to, to Liam Nesson as the Round Table knight Gawain. <br />   The music is another strong point for this movie.  In a stroke of genius, John Boorman instead of wanting an original score extensively uses Wagner and Carl Oraff's `Carmina Burana' before it was fashionable. It seems so appropriate since Wagner's music is for operas that explore similar myths to the Arthurian legend or are itself based on the myth, Parsifal. <br />   The movie is rated R because of nudity and sexual scenes, and scenes of combat with blood and limbs being chopped off. <br />  This movie is the best mythical tale on a screen until the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br />
B00008OE4W|4.0|A great film that captures the start of the dot com period of history. With a twist to the story that pays homage to some of the urban legends that are running around. Altogether a good story with a cast that knows what they are doing and are enjoying themselves while doing it.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This being the gorillaz second major release, it was a given that I would pick it up. A fan of Blur and the original Gorillaz album, I expected to be treated to the same blissful pop ear-candy that was the first Gorillaz album. I wasn't. I do not see this album becoming as popular as the previous one. However, the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate it for what Damon Albarn wants it to be (or.. what the Gorillaz intend it to be). A complete mix of many styles and yet still catchy in its own peculiar way. Taking a cue from the first album, its neat to imagine all the various guest rappers being channeled through Russell.. The only drawbacks to me are the lack of the three other original 'members' of the band.. Deltron, Dan the A. and Miho Hatori (sp?) do not seem to have returned. This at once lets the band be seen as more of its own separate identity (or it makes it seem as solely belonging to Damon Albarn.. a plus or minus as you may decide for yourself.) The addition of Danger Mouse is nice.. I'm sure his skills are evident in the loops and beats throughout the album but I'm not familiar with the Grey album. This is more then just an album of music tracks. It's a neat little continuation of a musical experiment and deserving of being listened to as an album.  <br />Aside from the techno DJ influences, guest rapping and pondering voice of Albarn.. there's so many other musical highlights on the album.. gospel choirs, violins, piano solos.. in fact the only major drawback  is that annoying \\"BreeOW!\\" on track 9 (November Has Come) and I will only forgive it since I imagine its Noodle yelping along to the music..  <br /> <br />Highlights: Dennis Hopper's narration on track 13. How is that for cool? And for some reason the beat on Kids with Guns is one of my favorites.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Part of me really wants to be nice to \\"Star Trek: Nemesis.\\"  After all, it could very well be the last Star Trek film ever.  However, this film has such major problems that it can't be viewed as more than a mediocre Trek entry.<br /><br />The entire first hour of this film is borderline boring.  Star Trek film usually take a while to get going, but \\"Nemesis\\" takes this to absurd lengths.  Other than a shocking opening scene, very little happens in the film's first act, with the exception of the car chase (more on that atrocity later).  With the exception of Stewart, none of the actors here stand out.  The Trek regulars are obviously trying because they knew this would be their last gyst, but they still come off as dull, and Worf is turned into a comic sidekick.<br /><br />The guest list in \\"First Contact\\" and \\"Insurrection\\" was impressive- Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Kridge, F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Zerbe, Donna Muprhey.  Here, we're instead stuck with Tom Hardy and Dina Meyer.  Hardy obviously tries as the villain Shinzon, but he's hampered by the fact that he bears no resemblance to Picard (who's supposedly his doppleganger) and that he spends half the film trying to imitate Khan (Trek villains really need to stop that; no one will ever again match Khan).  Meyer shows no energy whatsoever.  The only good guest star is Ron Perlman, but he's criminally underused (see \\"Hellboy\\" for what this guy is capable of).<br /><br />The greatest flaw of \\"Nemesis\\" is that it is, at heart, a dumb action film.  This is Star Trek Lite.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Star Trek films have always been about ideas over action, but in the age of loud explosions and mindless thrills (after all, Jerry Bruckheimer is now one of the most successful producers ever), this formula has come to look like a dinosaur to mainstream audiences.  The Star Trek producers would inevitably try to make the franchise appeal to mainstream audiences again by sacrificing Star Trek's very soul, while at the same time trying to keep hardcore fans on board.  The result is a film that is still too talky and slow for mainstream audiences, but is dumbed down just enough to piss off Trekkies.<br /><br />Case in point is the \\"car chase\\" early on in the film.  It has little importance to the plot, and it's downright stupid.  Of course, it is competently done, but you never get the feeling when you're watching it that this is a Star Trek film- it could have been pulled out of any Bruckheimer picture.  I'm not even getting into the flaws that geeks spot, such as how the Enterprise crew in this sequence basically ignores all Federation protocol.<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm roasting \\"Nemesis,\\" let me say that it's not a BAD movie in the sense that \\"The Final Frontier\\" was.  Indeed, \\"Nemesis\\" can be lauded for doing one thing right- saving its best for last.  All of its memorable moments happen in the final 40 minutes, which contain such impressive and tense space battles that you almost forget everything stupid that's happened before.  Almost, that is.<br /><br />I gave both \\"Insurrection\\" and \\"Nemesis\\" three stars, but \\"Insurrection\\" is the superior film, if only because it tries to stick to the Star Trek formula.  \\"Nemesis\\" is a misguided attempt to reshape Star Trek into an action franchise, and it simply doesn't fit.  Star Trek is supposed to be about more than space battles and explosions.  I don't know if there will ever be another Trek film, but \\"Nemesis\\" shows what happens to good franchises when their producers decide that they must be dumbed down for mainstream tastes (see the 1989-1997 \\"Batman\\" franchise for another example of this).  It is an enjoyable film with some great action scenes, but it has little else.  And Star Trek deserves better.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|A great Christmas movie. Elf works because Will Farrell is a comedy genius, and the story is just different enough to create a feel-good experience. Elf is not going to win any awards or probably even show up on any Best Movie lists - but if you are looking for a good holiday movie with some laughs then Elf is your best bet in years. Also this is a great movie for kids. In fact I think the target audience is kids as there are no adult-jokes that come to mind at all.
B00005LB9O|4.0|Travis followed up their best album, The Man Who, with The Invisible Band.  This cd is very similar to The Man Who, with almost the exact same feel to it.   <br /> <br />Just like TMW, this album is quite solid, and can be played from start to finish quite easily, whether you're driving in your car, or just listening to this as background music around the house.  In fact, my little 5 year old daughter absolutely loves 2 or 3 of the songs on this disc.  It's a very friendly cd for all ages. <br /> <br />I do applaud Travis' effort here, they have created another great album.  For anyone who loves The Man Who, and does not own this, buy it!  This album is much better than their newest cd, 12 Memories.  Travis does best when they keep their music simple, and melodic, and this is a perfect example of both.  Fran Healy has one of the best voices in the biz!
B0009PVZWI|3.0|Foo Fighters \\"In your honor\\"    After listening to DISC ONE it is safe to say that \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" is still easily the Foo Fighters finest moment. After watching the bonus DVD it is easy to appreciate the effort that has gone into the \\"rock\\" CD, however in my opinion the band has tried too hard and numerous songs on the album are forced with the end result being a pedestrian release devoid of any major highlights.  In racing terms this would be a one-paced horse that fails to accelerate in a distance event. The Foo Fighters need to go back to basics, let the lyrics and music flow and not try to force the issue. Many football teams make the mistake of trying to score on every play and the Foo Fighters are guilty of this throughout this album.     Whilst it is certainly not a complete dud and will likely create a few radio hits I doubt it will ultimately fulfil Dave's wish of being the album fans will remember in 20 years time. Whether or not the Foo Fighters have an album in them to rival \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" remains to be seen, however unless they go back to their roots it may be a pipedream.    The album is far from being overproduced or cheesy it is just that on the whole some songs simply don't work. I really wanted to like this album (TCATS is currently in my 3-disc player) but I am only prepared to give it a 6.5/10    DISC TWO    I must say that DISC TWO made the whole experience worthwhile. Certainly a risk for a rock group to produce an album of acoustic numbers, however the experiment works and reminds us of what could have been on DISC ONE. There are some similarities with Nirvana and The Eagles to be found here and I am interested in the background of some of the songs and the motives behind them. Dave's vocals are not stretched, the songs provide a welcome dose of emotion and this DISC would be well suited to following one of Dido's efforts at a dinner party.  7.5/10      OVERALL: On the whole \\"In Your Honour\\" is likely to appease many fans but disappoint its fair share also despite the acoustic disc providing some hope for future Foo Fighters releases. It will be interesting to see where the band goes next, however trying to produce another TCATS could be a step back in the right direction. The album and the concept no doubt will sell quite well, and reviews will vary depending on personal tastes, however on the whole this release is a letdown.    ***          In your Honor    Yes we can hear you screaming Dave. There is an immense build of pressure and expectation in this song, and when the pressure valve should be released there is nothing left.     No Way Back    This is what the Foo's do best, straight up and down rocker that is a likely grower. Up beat with some ferocious guitar work this song gives the album some much-needed momentum.    Best Of You  Complex, varied, powerful and at time it comes across as being a little forced. Definitely a grower and a major hit, however this song just felt overdone, somewhat repetitive and in need of a little more respite to take it to the next level. Nevertheless will be a feature when the Foo's unleash their best of.    DOA    This is a great song and one of the very few highlights on DISC ONE. The band seems to have let go on this occasion and not tried to force the issue on the listener. Would not have been out of place on TINLTL and is more towards the mainstream than some of the other tracks on the album. Great drums and solid guitar work are a standout here.    HELL    After another heavy opening this song threatens to lighten up, but quickly swings back to a ferocious mix of vocals and loud guitar. Another song where the build up doesn't seem to take the song anywhere.    THE LAST SONG    Catchy intro, great drums, powerful yet restrained vocals lead into a song more reminiscent of the \\"Colour and the shape\\". Solid, stock standard Foo's song that is a potential grower.    FREE ME    The intro brings back memories of the Foo's (Dave's) debut. Although the song certainly has its moments it never reaches any great heights and is unlikely to go much further than this album    RESOLVE    A far more laidback tune that doesn't take it itself too seriously and benefits as a result. Solid guitar, drums and vocals throughout but only an average song by the Foo's standard in the end.    THE DEEPEST BLUES ARE BLACK    After a gentle bluesy intro the song launches itself with some powerful guitars and vocals that are fairly well contained in this song. Has some interesting moments musically but like most of this album fails to reach any great heights and hard to see it going anywhere.    END OVER END    This song has the right formula, right structure and is largely free of Dave's shouting and would be right at home on TINLTL.  After establishing a very solid platform to create something special to finish off disc one this one falls short of the mark.    DISC TWO    STILL    Flowing on from the rock album this song initially was relief before boredom set in. Just does not go anywhere.    WHAT IF I DO?    This song has a lot going for it and would have been welcomed on the rock album albeit after an injection of power. There is enough here to keep the listener more than a little interested.    MIRACLE    Memories of the old \\"Foo Fighters\\" are starting to flood back. Dave's vocals on this one are first class and again the structure would have been appreciated on the first CD.    ANOTHER ROUND    Another strong performance vocally from Dave but this is nothing more than a simple song. Could well be used at some pubs and clubs to signal final drinks although it is unlikely to knock Khe Sanh off its pedestal in Australia.    FRIEND OF A FRIEND    This one has a \\"Nirvana\\" feel about it, similar to \\"Something in the Way\\" and even has \\"Nevermind\\" in the lyrics. Interesting on a number of fronts and interesting to see where this song came from and the ideas behind it.    OVER AND OUT    Nice acoustic guitar to start proceedings, solid vocals and after starting to lose its way towards the middle Dave brings it back from the brink with some excellent and heartfelt vocals.  At last two pretty good songs back to back.    ON THE MEND    The acoustic album is now easily over the line in terms of preference. This is far from a being a great song but it flows on nicely from some excellent songs down the order.    VIRGINIA MOON    Experimental, laidback, a little gimmicky and doesn't really go anywhere but certainly was an interesting experience.    COLD DAY IN THE SUN    The heaviest acoustic song on the disc and in places sounds very similar to The Eagles with the guitar, vocal work and general vibe. On the whole a pretty good song for Disc 2 and hit material if dressed up for the disappointing first disc.    RAZOR    Some interesting guitar work here and Dave's form on the acoustic CD continues with a solid vocal delivery. Standard fare in light of other songs on DISC TWO.
B000069AUI|5.0|I remember first getting this cd, and being floored by what I heard.  This was nothing like their first release, Parachutes, like I'd been expecting.  Coldplay had proven to be a more mature, and developed band with a very unique and original sound.  Each song had a very refreshing feel to it, and didn't sound like any of the other tracks (which is something I can't say about X&Y). <br /> <br />This album doesn't get any better than the first track, Politik.  What an incredible song.  There's definitely a message here in this song, and it's secondary.  The song has a driving piano line, and drum beat.  All topped off by one of Chris Martin's greatest vocals. <br /> <br />Possibly the best single released on this album is Clocks.  This song has been duplicated on their next album with Speed of Sound.  But this song, Clocks, was so unlike anything I'd heard before.  There was no song I could think of to compare it to.  This song would be played over and over again as I'd drive to and from work.  Great tune. <br /> <br />My personal favourite though, is Amsterdam.  A very personal, and moving song.  It's first 4 minutes are very sincere, and peaceful, and sad.. and the last minute is huge with it's grand finish.  There's no better Coldplay song than this one.  I'd have paid $15 just to get this song on cd.   <br /> <br />Coldplay's first two albums are great because of their originality.  X&Y finds them moving into U2's current niche, which is finding a sound that their comfortable with, and not deviating from it.  Which is all good, except for that's completely different than what I expected from them.   <br /> <br />Buy A Rush of Blood to the Head, than Parachutes, and then X&Y.. the first two discs are far superior to their 3rd.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|Brian Eno's \\"On Land\\", recorded over the course of four years, is a meditation on places.  Whereas previous albums were intended to serve as soundtracks to different events (\\"Music for Films\\", \\"Music For Airports\\"), were fusions of someone else's idiom into his own (\\"The Plateaux of Mirrors\\", \\"No Pussyfooting\\"), or were Eno simply looking for his own footing in experimentation with often amazing results (\\"Another Green World\\", \\"Discreet Music\\"), this one seeks a more specific goal, to bring the listener into Eno's experience of a location. <br /> <br />What is remarkable is that the record succeeds so well in such an abstract goal.  Eno is able to raise the sort of spirits he is trying to.  Admittedly, it seems like he's not entirely happy with these places (or times?), there's a sense of foreboding, longing, and nearly hopelessness on the strongest cuts on the record (\\"The Lost Day\\", \\"Shadow\\").  The exception to this is the oddly optimistic and brilliant \\"Unfamiliar Wind\\", which evokes a sense of expectation and happiness.  In all, this is really one of the better records in his catalog.  Recommended.
B0000028MA|5.0|Well I am a huge fan of the late 80s early 90s Seattle scene. I love everything from Green River to Pearl Jam to Nirvana to Mudhoney to Love Battery on and on. Well this demonstrates perfectly the Seattle sound. It features two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs that weren't released. It has Mother Love Bone. It really shows the music as it was. I advise you to pick this up.
B0002PZVH0|4.0|Brian Eno's \\"Music For Airports\\" is a further realization of his ambient concept, first realized on \\"Discreet Music\\".  The concept again is similar, simple lines of varying lengths are played in loops, allowing them to interact in various ways.  The results are often times remarkable.  For music intended to be background material, this work can grab your attention. <br /> <br />The opening movement, and probably the best on the release, is a good example of Eno's idiom-- two or three extended loops of simple piano and electric piano intertwine.  The results are absolutely stunning as the music has a delicate and gentle quality to it.  While the rest of the record isn't nearly as good as this piece (one piece is a vocal-only loop piece, one is vocal-and-piano, and the closer is pure synthesizer), it is all quite good. <br /> <br />\\"Music For Airports\\" is an engaging and interesting record, well worth investigation for anyone interested in ambient music.  I prefer Eno's \\"Discreet Music\\" for early ambient material, but this is a superb record.  Recommended.
B000002BSV|5.0|I'm not even really sure that this is a 5 star CD, probably a 4, but because it was released almost 10 years ago and I still pop it in every once in a while and still sing along to it, that had to give it an extra point.  <br />Before getting into the music, one of the things I love most about this CD is the cover artwork.  It looks like a university project, kind of hastily put together, but with a certain amount of appeal.<br />If you didn't have any idea what direction this CD was going to go in, &quot;Trash&quot; pretty much sets the tone.  This is about as opposite of DogmanStar as you can get.  While a few of the faster songs tend to blend together (why were &quot;Filmstar&quot; and &quot;Lazy&quot; put back to back?), they are written well. But let's be honest, the strength of this album rests in the ability of Suede to play those faster tracks and then stick a fabulous ballad in the middle, like they do with &quot;By the Sea&quot;.  <br />The closing track, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was also a good fit for that position and if you've seen the video, that was also well done.  <br />Although they may have more critically acclaimed releases, this one is my favourite, not because of its radio-friendly nature, but just because the whole album is worth listening to, something Suede has had a bit of trouble with on their previous recordings.
B00001OH7T|5.0|There are loads of reviews on this CD. Some people like it (like me) some people loathe it, especially it seems, the 'Across the Universe' cover.  Well, I love the one word songs (Fame, Win and Fascination), and they are enough to make the whole album worth while.  The title cut is great, and only David Bowie has the chutzpah to cover 'Across the Universe' on a Philly Soul album with the songwriter (John Lennon) sitting in on the track. <br /> <br />Speaking of songwriters sitting in on tracks, in none of the umpteen reviews I've read on this CD does it mention the first recorded appearance (as a songwriter and backing singer) of Luther Vandross. Yes, THAT Luther Vandross, is here lending his smoothe stylings to the mix.
0887307280|5.0|I have to admit, in my business I have been a little anti-system; while trying to maintain the \\"home-town\\" feel of my management philosophy.   <br /> <br />After reading this book I am believer in sytems and a good operations binder.  We (as a management team) read this book and have finally some progress toward our over-all goal for success in our industry.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book to any person who has started a business or is thinking of taking the leap into business ownership.  Lets face it, you are doing this so you can retire early and spend more time doing the things you want to do rather than what you boss tells you.  <br /> <br />As a side note, I also downloaded the audio copy of this book on itunes for my ipod, however found the author to be a very slow at narration.  Not bad, just slow.  I would recommend this in its book form as this is the kind of book that is redlined and highlighted in every chapter.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Released in 1987, this film is based on a book by the same name by New York author Helene Hanff of her correspondence with a bookseller Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins)of Marks & Co. at 84, Charing Cross Road, London. Hanff (Anne Bancroft) and Doel develop a friendship, beginning in 1949, when she orders her first book from the London company, that lasts for 20 years. The brash Hanff and the gentle Doel carry on a correspondence that deepens into something both beautiful and bittersweet since they never meet. Hanff gets sidetracked in her planned visits to London because of recurring unforeseen expenses. Dental work and new apartments get in her way.<br /><br />The movie is not for everyone, just those who love books. It will easily become one of your favorite movies. You can practically smell the wonderful \\"antiquarian\\" books in the London shop where Doel works. (Hanff opines early on that the word \\"antiquarian\\" scares her since it often denotes expensive books.)<br /><br />Brancroft and Hopkins are joined by Judy Dench who plays Hopkins' wife. All three actors give excellent performances. It's good to know that Ms. Bancroft can be remembered for other fine roles besides her portrayal of an older married woman (Mrs. Robinson) who seduces a younger man in THE GRADUATE.<br /><br />There are many interesting touches here about current events-- actual television footage from Queen Elizabeth's Coronation, references to the Civil Rights Movement-- Hanff at one point  gets arrested when she gets in the middle of a student demonstration-- and the rationing of meat in England after World War II.<br /><br />The beauty of this film is that when you mention it to another booklover, they light up. You know if you aren't already, that you and they will become friends.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Review by Tyler Wagnon: <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree plays melodic, progressive rock with a bit of a lean to the metal side here and there. They have always been sort of hit or miss, not so much from album to album, but more from song to song, even riff to riff. However, when they hit, they really f-ing hit. Particularly in their more somber tracks, for example, \\"Trains\\" from their In Absentia album is simply one of the most gorgeous songs of the prog rock genre. <br /> <br />Deadwing, the follow up to In Absentia, pretty much picks up where the other left off. They continue to forge a pretty unique path with their infectious melodies, and relentless experimentation. The vocals and riffs on \\"Shallow\\" and \\"Open Car\\" have a distinct Tool/Maynard feel to them, which is some of their best aggressive tracks to date. \\"Lazarus\\" is a somber tune rife with piano, acoustic guitar, and a stringed arrangement, complimented by Steven Wilson's beautiful singing. \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\" starts out somber enough, but at around 6 minutes rips into a nice heavy riff and before it's all said and done, the song reverts into a guitar solo backed by light percussion and ambient noise. <br /> <br />On an interesting side note, Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth helps out with harmonizing vocals on the title track, \\"Lazarus\\", and \\"Arriving Somewhere\\" as well as playing the above mentioned solo on \\"Arriving Somewhere\\". <br /> <br />As with past releases, the somber vocals and harmonies are superb, and sometimes the more forceful singing loses me a bit, but they pull it off better on this release than in the past. If you liked them before, you will like them again. If you are a little leery of the \\"progressive\\" nature of the music, give it a try. I hate 90% of any music considered progressive, but Porcupine Tree are way better than most.
B00028HBKC|5.0|That will immortalize Mel Gibson's movie making credentials, long after he has passed from this world.<br /><br />If you did not catch this movie in theaters, be advised to bring lot's of tissues to this DVD showing. The graphic horror of re-creating the real life sadistic nature of the Roman's flogging of JC, will break your heart. If one could go back in time and bring a handy cam with them, this movie is the closest depiction to what one would have captured had they witnessed Jesus' trial and execution.<br /><br />And for those who protested this was \\"anti-Semitic\\" on it's release; Thank you for making ticket sales and now DVD sales, skyrocket. And I'll pray for you that you are so angered by the real history of the Pharisee's, that now you would label those who dare broadcast the truth as anti-Semitic. It's your history, live with it!<br /><br />As long as religious leaders can compell followers to keep looking up they'll stay in power! Faith is the best friend religious leadership has ever had; It's kept them in business all these years!<br /><br />As for the commentary by Vice \\"Martee is useless \\"; You said it all pal! You're useless AND you proved it to millions of readers on this site. Immortality as an AHole. Your mum must be so proud...that someone invented birth control AFTER you were born!
B000002KET|5.0|This is one of the best of the Ozzy era Sabbath albums!  The only one I would rate better is the very first album.  I really do not think they ever topped that first album, but this one is a close second.  Metal at its best!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Just because this cd is \\"copy protected\\" doesn't mean you can't make copies. I have bought other cds that are so called copy protected and I had no problems importing them into my i-pod. Once you copy the cd into your i-tunes folder you can make as many copies as you like. Not that I'm endorsing the pirating of cds. I just think we should be able to make copies for our own personal use.  Those of you who are against cd copying let me ask you this: how many times have you bought a cd for one song and the rest of it sucked?If bands want us to stop copying their cds they need to start making better music. This cd is a fine example of a great band in it's prime. If you decide to actually buy this cd I don't think you will be disapointed. The second disc is kinda slow. but it's still ok. I can definitly see a lot of hit singles coming off this album.
B000002LUB|5.0|I truly think that this is the best Black Sabbath recording with Ronnie James Dio as lead singer!  It is a solid album.  I had to listen to it a few times before I really liked it, but once I did, I liked it a lot.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Another \\"effort\\" by a tremendously overrated band Dream Theater. Instead of continuing to produce the same dull music they made in the last whatever albums, they now decided to copy the \\"greats\\" of the 70's. Their greatest accomplishment remains the same up to this day: covering the whole Master Of Puppets album live. That's what they are capable of - covering other people's work, and they do it very well. This is very very sad, that a band with five skilled musicians in it can not write their own great music. <br /> <br />I give it two starts(Collectors/fans only), because I am 100% sure that Dream Theater fans will find a lot of enjoyment here. If you're not a Dream Theater enthusiast, stay away. <br /> <br />Of course, if this was a Dream Theater site, it would be rated great or perhaps even masterpiece, but we are rating ALL prog albums here, and I did my best at trying to be as tolerant and objective as I could
0385510454|2.0|I loved how much Grisham loves Italy. It infused his writing with a passion and grace that made the \\"travelogue\\" sections great fun to read. But the plot and the characters? Yawn. I completely missed the part where our hero falls in love with the mysterious and sad Francesca. When did that happen exactly? And what of American ex-patriate professor,  Luigi and Hermano? We're introduced to them at length and then there is no resolution to their story line. The action? What action? So while I enjoyed turning the pages as I was actually reading this book, now that I'm done I feel as though I wasted my time.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Yes I agree the protection for this cd is alittle overbord, but cd's are to be listened to; You don't need a fu*king pc for that quit b**tching. As for the music I personaly like the second disc better. Its more original, and distinctive. The first disc is good but gets boring. If you like the foo fighters buy it its worth it.
0425163407|1.0|I had always heard good things about Patricia Cornwell, but this book left me extremely disappointed!  <br /> <br />1: the main character Kay Scarpetta - rude, arrogant and seemingly in love with her own vast bastion of talents.  Probably the reason why she can't find time for a relationship - no one will ever be like her. <br /> <br />2: the story had more loose ends that a shag pile carpet. The plot was all over the place and ended suddenly as if Cornwell had gotten bored of the story or realised that there was no way she was going to be able to piece it all together in time, so just grasped at available straws (or minor characters) and laid the blame at the characters feet.  Even the last scene between the guilty party and Scarpetta was pathetic, the villian just blew her nose and yelled a bit.  <br /> <br />3: the book was more concerned with description of processes than entertainment, story development or character interaction.   <br /> <br />In my opinion this was a paint-by-numbers version of a crime thriller.   <br /> <br />Less thrills, no chills.
0393317552|5.0|If you have not heard of the theories expounded in this book, it will be a real eye-opener for any reader. Contained within the text is really the mechanism that decided which civilizations were to be successful and which were to remain in the early stages of development.  The author does an excellent job explaining in clear easy to understand terms the reasons for Western European civilization's dominance.  A dominance to the point of colonizing the remaining lesser developed regions of the Earth. <br />In a nutshell the Author's point is that every primitive culture has already leveraged and maximized any advantage the environment has offered.  Western Europe had inherited and developed the gifts bequeathed from Mesopotamian civilizations including, domesticated animals, some optimal grain crops, some fiber crops.  With this springboard combined with the discovery of steel making and by happenstance a society exposed and partially immune to the affects of the major diseases affecting urban populations, it became an invincible combination to subjugate and rule major portions of the globe.  Areas of the world that did not benefit from having all the right ingredients or stepping stones to capitalize their environment and take them to the next level were subdued.  An example would be a culture without a suitable pack animal such as the domesticated horse doomed that culture to manual labor and almost certain losses when their foot soldiers faced mounted cavalry for the first time. Kudos to the author, big ideas,well thought out, and presented well <br />
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I'll admit, I love British comedies. Whether it's Monty Python or a Hugh Grant, it's just my genre. This movie is personal a 5-star, but because of my bias, I'm saying it's a 4 to everyone else. It's funny, because they're just normal people in a weird situation. If you like British comedy, you'll love this. <br /> <br />About the zed-word: You don't have to love zombie movies, I don't. I have a friend that does, but I'm more of 'a once you see one undead person, you've seen them all' type of person. What I liked was the fresh approach on an absurb topic. The movie looks at the humor behind putting a normal person in an abnormal situation. The zombies are just the choosen abnormal situation, it could have been aliens or vampires. The zombies do make it a bit gory so it's not for the faint. <br /> <br />All-in-all, I am glad that I received this and have it in my collection. It has repeat-watchablity.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the finest Westerns ever, and a must see if you wish to familiarize yourself with the genre.<br /><br />Sergio Leone is most famous for his Man With No Name trilogy which brought Clint Eastwood to international fame.  His epic view of the American West is probably only matched by that of John Ford, but his films have a very distinct, mythical quality to them. Probably because Sergio Leone was not an American but an Italian.  It's more than a little odd that an Italian is responsible for some of the most indelible Western images of all time.  Then again Italy is famous for its artists.<br /><br />As with many Leone films the music score is done by none other than Ennio Morricone, and while the film would have been good without it, the music, as always, accentuates and compliments the film.  With Morricone the music becomes an unseen character that skillfully shapes the action.  Seek out all of his work, it's the product of genius.<br /><br />Charles Bronson as the harmonica wielding gunslinger is second only to Eastwood in the bad ass department.  But what makes this film so memorable is the villain played by Henry Fonda.  An obvious departure from most of, if not all of his other performances.  He's not just bad, he's evil, to the point where you boo and hiss (if only in your head) everytime he pops up on screen.<br /><br />If there's something that personifies the West Leone threw it in this movie, be it trains, six guns, horses, you name it, you'll probably find it here.<br /><br />The Western is an endangered genre that desperately needs help.  Movies like this show us why the Western deserves a reprieve from its inevitable extinciton, so watch this and any other Western that you can find.  Help the cause and tell a friend.<br /><br />P.S. \\"People scare better when they're dying.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|I admit to being a U2 fan. I liked parts of All That You Can't Leave Behind very much, but some of the songs were blah, like Stuck in a Moment and Wild Honey. I was worried about this one. I didn't need to be. It's varied, interesting and emotional. It's the strongest U2 album since Achtung Baby. There's lots of great stuff on here. I'm shocked it got an average of 3 stars on Amazon. It deserves a much better rating. It's packed solid  with quality.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is an absolute masterpiece, showcasing the grittiness of New York City and the necessity of looking at  insanity in context.  In Martin Scorsese's breakneck film American audiences are treated to a brutal scrutiny of their own existence, whether it be the absurdity of party politics or the ever present danger of city life autonomy.<br /><br />The title character, one Travis Bickle, is played to disturbing perfection by Robert Deniro.  His gradual descent into self absorbed delusion results in one of film's most fascinating (and down right creepy) characters.  The conveyance of gentility coupled with madness has never been done better.<br /><br />Jodie Foster, as the damsel prostitute, gives a performance that borders on the impossible.  How an actress at that age could possibly play a hooker that convincingly either belies an eerily acute level of observation skills or a very poor upbringing.  I'd say her two Academy Awards probably eliminate the latter option.<br /><br />Taxi Driver has become an American fable, complete with heroes, villains, violence, and compassion.  A solid, complex film that defined urban drama and raised the bar for stark realism in film.  Besides, it inspired a presidential assassination attempt.  Obviously the film speaks to madmen, but it also echoes in the minds of the supposedly sane.<br /><br />One day Scorsese will be recognized with an Oscar, this film should have earned him that honor.  Too bad Hollywood doesn't give hindsight awards.
B000007T1M|5.0|System Of A Down are just too good to be considered nu metal in my opinion. These guys possess such great talent. Daron Malakian is no doubt far more superior than any typical nu metal guitarist. This guy can rip out some real fast ass riffs, and even some solos (listen to \\"Soil\\" for instance). Shavo Odadjian's bass work is pretty good but nothing too much to brag about. John Dolmayan's drumming is very good on here, and of course Serj Tankian's bizarre vocals are just excellent. Oh yeah about this album, it's great. My favorite songs are Soil, Sugar, Know, Spiders, Suite-Pee, War?, Ddevil, and P.L.U.C.K. The other songs are good, but the ones I mentioned are my favorites as you know. Anyways like I said before this is a great album. System Of A Down rocks!<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Suite-Pee: 5/5<br /><br />2. Know: 5/5<br /><br />3. Sugar: 5/5<br /><br />4. Suggestions: 5/5<br /><br />5.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay's third studio album, \\"X&Y\\" could very well have been doomed from the beginning.  First, the band had the audacity to record a flawless masterpiece, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" on only their sophomore attempt.  It is equally unfair and inevitable that \\"X&Y\\" will be judged in light of the high standard set by its predecessor.  Then came the PR circus surrounding the release of this album - \\"Coldplay is In Line to become the Next U2\\", \\"Coldplay is Ready to Save Rock and Roll\\", \\"Coldplay Must Pull EMI Back into Profitability\\", \\"Coldplay doesn't Care at all about EMI's Profitability\\", and on and on.  All of these events served to create public preconceptions and set unnaturally critical expectations before anyone had heard a single note of its music.   <br /> <br />Well, now we have that music and the verdict is:  it's a very good album, nothing more and nothing less.  This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's heard the first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", which is very similar to their earier hit \\"Clocks\\".  This album revisits Coldplay's signature sound and delivers 13 (yes, 13 - there is a hidden acoustic folk song at the end) strong examples of how good that sound can be.  So everyone can now take a breath, relax and enjoy it as simply the new Coldplay album.   <br /> <br />And make no mistake, this is a Coldplay album - if you like their sound, then you'll like this disc and vice versa.  The only real divergence from that formula comes in hints of 80s nostalgia.  For example, the piano melodies are now often augmented (or even replaced) by synth strings.  There are also throwbacks apparent in the rhythm section - Champion's drumming on \\"Square One\\" and \\"White Shadows\\" are reminiscent of vintage U2 and Big Country respectively.  And Guy Berryman finally gets the mix that his adept basswork has long deserved (i.e. you can hear him), sounding like a confident protege of a young Adam Clayton.   <br /> <br />Songwriting also owes allegiance to the 80s as well.\\"Square One\\" is probably the most \\"rock\\" track that they've ever released, and it sounds like the entire \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" album condensed into three minutes.  \\"Talk\\" contains elements of Kraftwerk melodies (they're even credited as co-writers), and \\"Low\\" was appropriately enough recorded along with Brian Eno, a longtime collaborator of David Bowie.   <br /> <br />There is a good balance between up-tempo numbers and ballads filled with Chris Martin's signature falsetto (\\"What If?\\", \\"Fix You\\").  This makes it a very easy album to listen to in its entirety.  It has the makings of another multi-platinum launched by several singles.  The strongest tracks include \\"Square One\\", \\"Fix You\\" and the very trippy/mellow Beatles-esque title track.   <br /> <br />The album does lose some points on unoriginality.  Contrast Coldplay's situation to that of U2 after \\"The Joshua Tree\\" - not content to simply release a sequel, Bono and company elected to tear their sound down and create something new, exciting and completely unexpected in \\"Achtung Baby\\".  Faced with a similar opportunity, Coldplay got cold feet - but they should have years head of them to craft a more mature creative course.  This inside-the-box thinking also makes the album a bit redundant by the end;  the strongest material is definitely showcased early on.   <br /> <br />So don't be weighed down by the hype machine - \\"X&Y\\" is a very good album but not Coldplay's greatest.  Still, it's highly recommended for fans of the band or anyone who appreciates well-crafted mellow alterna-rock.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves's movie is a real disaster of epic proportion with Reeves perhaps giving the worse performance of his career with a character that is as one-dimensional as they come. I don't know if he was trying to copy Clint Eastwood's delivery from Dirty Harry but he's comes across as a parody of that character and he makes the film into a mockery with it. The special effects are lackluster and the screenplay is a joke with atrocious dialog that almost painful to the ears. Some characters and subplots don't really coincide with the overall story and the last fifteen minutes of the film makes absolutely no sense at all. Rachel Weisz does give too much to this movie with a complicate and deep performance that is way too mature and complex for this film. She almost single handedly redeems the movie but while she is doing her part in covering up the many flaws this movie has, the movie itself has way too many for even her great talent to forgive.  <br /> <br />Avoid.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I wasn't a huge fan before.  I liked Clocks, but the other songs on \\"Rush\\" just didn't stand out for me.  I guess the hype made me buy this new CD, and I'm not dissapointed at all.  This CD is so awesome. Almost every single song on it is excellent.  I have to buy another one because I have played this CD into the ground.  Actually it made me go back to \\"Rush\\" and give it another chance.  I can not wait for more music from these guys.  Genius!!!
B0009AM5JA|1.0|I enjoyed Coldplay's first two albums, Parachutes, and A Rush of Blood to the Head, but there was always something there that mildly bugged me.  It came through in the last few songs of each album, which were a bit saccharine and forgettable.  However, these elements were forgivable, because there was so much other great stuff on those albums.  On this one, Coldplay has managed to distill all of the not-so-great qualities of their first two albums into one horrible, horrible mess.  This album, simply put, is the most boring thing I've listened to in a long time.  The songs all blend together, the production is murky, and the melodies sound way too adult contemporary for my tastes.  Many of the songs borrow musical phrases from their early stuff - especially &quot;Clocks.&quot;  And the lyrics?  &quot;Me and you are drifting into outer space&quot; - ugh!  This sounds like the kind of album a once good band releases after twenty years, after they've used up all of their good ideas and are just treading water for the sake of making more money and because they can't imagine doing anything else with their lives.  Kind of like Pink Floyd's The Division Bell - yuck! or The Cure's Wild Mood Swings - blech!  The fact that this is only Coldplay's third album does not bode well.  These dudes need to wake up, fast!, or else they're going to sink into total crappiness.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Foo Fighters for some years now.  Regardless of the copy protections--you can get around them if you have to--this is an awesome double disk set!  Buy it, tweak it, rip it, just get it and enjoy the best foo fighter album to date.
0385510454|2.0|I listened to this on an audio book and kept looking for the next CD. I could not believe that it just ended. I was hooked! Everything was going good couldn't wait to see what happened next and I was left hanging. Overall it was a good book until the end, where I felt I had just wasted 5 hours of listening.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Guys, it doesn't take a hacker to get around copy protection, it is absolutely one of the worst systems for protecting music ever devised....while putting in the CD, just hold down shift! it prevents the autorun program from opening and installing itself, and you can open up your favorite program to put it on your mp3 player (yes even itunes!)but if you have already let the stupid \\"mediamax\\" screen load, then you have to take the following step to remove the software from your computer (even if you didn't install it, you will know if this has happened to you because the playback will sound severely garbled) <br />open command prompt (start>programs>accessories>command prompt) and type the followind lines in (one at a time, pressing enter at the end): <br />net stop sbcphid <br />del %systemroot%\system32\drivers\sbcphid.sys <br />and you will be good to go! <br />im not advocating illegal downloading, but like you guys, i think that if you buy music you shouldn't be punished for owning a mp3 player. i think that if that solution doesn't work, they deserve to be downloaded off of. the foo fighters are my favorite band but i DESPISE copy protection. that being said, copy protection doesn't give you a good reason to give such a great album a one star review! grohl and co give their best effort to date, with tracks on the first cd being absolutely amazing, with a harder feel than previous foo albums, and grohl's vocal quality  having improved greatly. taylor hawkins drumming is superb, and the guitar hooks and chord progressions are perfect, and the foos continue to prove why they are my favorite band. then the second disk comes, and i put it in, not knowing what to expect. it takes some getting used to, but it is absolutely beautiful and a joy to listen to, and we hear grohl take a turn from the hard edged vocals of the first disc to a gentle singing that we have never really heard before and it works so wonderfully. 5 stars, best album of the year so far, there is something for everyone here.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|This CD is great, the music, the voice, the songs...EVERYTHING its perfect. <br />and the DVD....lmao funniest DVD ever, I loved it! you can watch Shakira being interviewed by Alejandro. I admit it though without Alejandro the DVD would be nothing :) <br /> <br />Good job Shakira can't wait for Oral Fixation Vol.2
B000063DFN|5.0|One of the best metal albums of its time.  \\"Rime\\" is an absolute classic!
0062515675|5.0|Usually \\"I don't have the time\\" is a phrase we commonly use when we come to a point where we're overwhelmed with work, meetings, study, etc.<br /><br />What this book essentially gives you is the way for you to become a better person from the inside to the outside, and helping you make time to do this.<br /><br />- \\"Know yourself\\", then you'll be able and have the willpower to change everything and anything you want in this life.<br /><br />- \\"Master your mind\\" and \\"Master your time\\" and take control of everyhting, so that abundance and happiness will always be in your life and in the life of those around you.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I was SO excited about seeing this film. I am a HUGE fan of the first film. I even went out and bought the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />This movie was a terrible dissapointment! I put it in, watched long enough to see Ethan Hunt degraded to womanizing, and then decided, that the creaters of the film ruined everything we liked about Ethan Hunt, and then some. <br /> <br />I hated this.
0380789019|5.0|I read this book many, many years ago and have never read another one anything like it.  After 60 years of constant reading, \\"Neverwhere\\" is one of only a handful of books that has stayed with me, stuck in my mind forever.  Out of probably thousands of books I've read, this one has to be my very favorite.  I recommend it to everyone I meet who has enough imagination to enjoy it.  Because a healthy imagination is definitely necessary!<br /><br />I won't summarize the plot here; others can do that better than I.  I don't even know how to classify it:  Mystery, Fantasy, Adventure, Horror?  \\"Neverwhere\\" is all of these. My advice?  Save it for a free weekend, turn off the phone, find a comfortable place to curl up with it, and prepare to enter another world.  This is THE most fantastic story I've ever come across!
1573223026|5.0|\\"A Long Way Down\\" is Hornby's best since \\"High Fidelity\\", it's a humorous, touching, always unique story of four disparate souls in crisis.  Hornby does a masterful job of differentiating the \\"voices\\" of each character and I couldn't help mentally casting it for the sure-to-be movie version. Hugh Grant - call your agent, you'd be a perfect \\"Martin\\"!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I would love to buy this CD; I've purchased every other FF disc and from what I've heard, Grohl and Co. are even better this time around. But no matter how good the music may be, I can't bring myself to buy a copy-protected disc. Sure, maybe there are some boneheads out there who will make free copies for all their pals without copy-protection. But I listen to most of my music in the car, or at work on my iTunes. I don't want people swiping CDs from my desk and I don't want the discs warping in the summer heat in the glove box, so I burn copies of CDs -- which I have PURCHASED -- so that I can enjoy them and still protect the original media in a nice cool library cabinet at home. <br /> <br />Other record companies are taking the trouble to devise a copy protection technology that works with iTunes. Until RCA does the same, I won't be buying any music from them.  <br /> <br />Sorry, Foo Fighters. Maybe I'll catch the tour.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I really don't understand why the previous reviewer can already criticize the 15th Anniversary Edition of Pretty Woman.  IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET!! No one has seen it, including her, from what I read of her review.  How can you possibly have the knowledge of what the 15th Anniversary Edition holds?  I for one will wait until this addition actually comes out before I review it.  I have only seen the original Pretty Woman, so anything extra will be a welcome treat for me, since it is one of my all-time favorite films.
B0006J28BO|4.0|You know, this film kept me laughing on and off all the time, especailly in several scenes when Haru (played by Anne Hathaway), the main character, sometime emotionally freaks out and screams aloud, like the one when she's found out she's become a half-cat! It was very funny, ha-ha-ha! And the waltzing part when Haru was dancing with the Baron was so classic too! Anne Hathaway and the rest of the cast have done a superb job in their voice-work! Meow!    The only problem is that it's kind of short in the story part; otherwise, it's all perfect in every other aspect, such as soundtrack, voice-work and choreography. Therefore, The Cat Retrns is really Meowth-ful! (No Pun Intended!). I'd like to give this film a 4 out of 5 stars for Meowth-ful performance! Meowwwth!
0634022296|5.0|This is the book Beatle musicians have long prayed for.  This is the best resource and a far better tool than looking up chords online.  The book provides the original keys and makes each song recognizable when you start to play it.  The book has done a real service in providing the correct form for the chords in each song.<br /><br />This book will undoubtedly delight Beatle fans and will certainly draw in people who are just becoming familiar with their works.  You will learn the chords and will soon be happily singing along as you play Beatle songs!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|it's a good movie with an awesome soundtrack, whenever it listen to it, i sing it all day long ! the storyline's a little bit been here, done that, but still, Johnny Depp makes all the difference ! i would definitely recommend the movie to any Grease fan or to anyone for that matter !!!!
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|I have been excited about most of the special edition releases of the Star Trek films and was hoping to see much more on this one than I did.  I still like the story and the movie.  The text commentary by Okuda is wonderful as always.  But there really isn't much more to this version than the previous release of it.  The first release had digital 5.1 and widescreen and a behind the scenes documentary.  The special edition has all that, DTS, the text commentary, and subtitles, as well as background featurettes that aren't all that inspiring to watch.  I was disappointed to see no deleted scenes or a audio commentary by the director or any of the actors.  If you are a fan you probably already bought this.  If not and you are happy with the original release, save your money or wait till you can buy this used.  If you need the subtitles (I never understand why any dvd would be without them) or DTS mix then maybe this is worth it to you.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I love the Foo Fighters and have all their CDs but I am not buying this CD. Because it is copy protected I can't put it on my Ipod. You've got to be kidding. People need to boycott these CDs or the record industry is going to continue to produce them and limit individual usage rights. I'm not wanting to copy and sell the thing. I just want to put it on my Ipod and not have to pay for it twice by buying the CD and then paying again to purchase this CD via Itunes. That is just plain not right. Don't buy this CD and help put a stop to the unfair copy protection process!!!!!! Sorry Grohl.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|First off I want to say that anyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars is a Fu**ing idiot! This is the most un-inspred garbage from a band I greatly respected. SOAD's self titled album was GREAT!! Toxicity was pretty damn good, and this is just B.S.!!! What happened to the band with an edge. The band with inspiring deep lyrical content. Why are they singing about partying in the desert? Why do I feel like MTV hypnotized SOAD and convinced them they were the Backstreet Boys? I downloaded this CD to see if it was worth buying, and suprisingly it wasnt even worth the download! Well I still have the older works of a once great band to fill the void that this horrid album has left me with. WTF Happened!!!!! What the hell are these jokers thinking??  <br /> <br />GO BUY THE NEW DEVILDRIVER AT THE END OF THE MONTH 6/28/05 I believe......save your money!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Wow! I've finally got to see the uncut version of Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, the very first masterpiece by the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli! Sore wa Sugoi Desu Yo! (Japanese: It's so awesome and amazing!) Alison Lohman and the rest of the English cast have really done their homework to portray their roles respectively. I especially love Ms. Lohman as Princess Nausicaa and Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa, because they both have regal bearings too! Wow! They're as good as it gets!    Everything is so awesome; the soundtrack, the voicework, the story, the action scenes, the art work, and everything else is so perfect, and well done too. Everything has been refined to the state-of-the-art level, which is what Studio Ghibli has been famous for. What's more, the message for peace, perseverance and prosperity, along with harmony and enviornmental protection and balance, have really touched deeply in my heart right from the start.    Overall, I'd like to say \\"Doomo Arigato Gozaimasu\\" to the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli for their great masterpiece, and shall give them 5 out of 5 stars for outstanding performance! Sayonara!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|What a terrific rock album!  There isn't much to say about this except that it flat out rocks.  The band, Jet, doesn't try to do anything particularly special here.  They just set it up and play good old fashioned rock and roll from beginning to end.  It's one of the best commercial records I can remember purchasing in recent memory.   <br /> <br />By now, everyone knows the catchy rhythms of \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl,\\" but what a lot of folks may not know is that this album isn't content to display one or two good songs, but it's filled with them.  If you like the break-out hit, chances are, you'll love this and play it frequently.  \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" and \\"Rollover DJ\\" provide the rock anthems that we haven't heard in a while.   <br /> <br />At the same time, it's hard to get bored with the style, because there is plenty to change the pallet, such as \\"Look What You've Done.\\"   <br /> <br />Plainly put, this band will be around for a long while.  The frightening part is that they will probably get BETTER as the years go by.   <br /> <br />It may be early to put them in the RNR Hall of Fame, but with an effort like this, it's not terribly difficult to imagine.  I can't wait to see if they are able to build on this!
B000002X1O|5.0|True rating - an entire galaxy (Andromeda)  Some wonder what happened  to  the  principle players of the original Jefferson Airplane. The answer is that they kept getting better. During the time of this album's release, it was period  of the Jefferson Airplane -Jefferson Starship continuum when Jack and Jorma went off to form Hot Tuna while  Grace Slick and Paul Kantner had a child and for a time  made some of their best albums.    After Paul Kantner's successful solo project the 1970 science fiction rock epic \\"Blows Against the Empire\\" Kantner found himself in one of his most prolific writing periods. His writing style takes the form of the prophetic as he contemplates the meaning of the psychedelic  experience -his conclusion is that man's destiny lies in the stars.    Baron von Tollbooth and the Chrome Nun (the pet names bestowed  upon Slick and Kantner by their friend David Crosby) is a very mature  well produced  yet a daring  album that continues the Kantner space theme. Sharing the bill with Kantner and Slick is old folkie friend David Freiberg. They are joined  by a group that  reads like a who's who of the San Francisco  psychedelic scene: drummers John Barbata (formerly of CSN&Y) and Mickey Hart (loaned out from the Grateful Dead), Jorma Kaukonen,   legendary bassist Jack Casady, Violinist  Papa John Creech, the Pointer Sisters, David Crosby, Jack Traylor (a fellow psychedelic space rocker) and even Jerry Garcia himself. The entire album has a polished sound that has somewhat mystical theme layered on top of Kantner's visions  of life in space.    1) The Ballad of the Chrome Nun (Freiberg/Slick)  The song is classic Slick in its irreverence but is also optimistic. Although she may be poking fun at traditional religion  there is a spiritual nature to it. The song is well textured and Slick is in great voice.    2) Fat (Slick)  Backed up by the Pointer Sisters this song  has unmistakable religious almost Gospel music sound to it. Her lyric \\"so we all went through the wall\\" suggests such things as telepathy and telekinesis. And the fat  which she sings about seems to refer to excesses - most likely the excesses of the 60s. Yet in no way is this  group giving up their values but paring them down in preparation for a new world they envision. The repetition of Slick belting out the word \\"someday\\" is moving and hopeful. It is obvious  that they want  the psychedelic parade to continue  but  with a new focus.    3) Flowers of the Night (Traylor)  The song is sung by Kantner and in the lyric of this song Traylor lists political, intellectual and spiritual revolutionaries as  the song tells a story of change. The song  contains some beautiful guitar work.    4) Walkin' (Kantner/Slick)  The music is  bouncy with Creech on Violin in his characteristic style and Slick on the piano. The lyric is somewhat cryptic  but seems to offer a justification for the  chances taken in their  psychedelic rock and roll life style as well as  an invitation to the listener to live vicariously through their life, music and visions. Again like the rest of the songs on the album it is a very hopeful song.    5) Your Mind Has Left Your Body (Kantner)  This song seems to have to do with astroprojection and it was  written in the days when Kantner Leary and others were attempting to experiment with the phenomena. The \\"White Bear\\" some say refers to Augustus Owsley Stanley and the part of the chorus \\"riders of the rainbow\\" may come from the book title \\"Warriors of the Rainbow\\"-a book  about the mystical experiences of the American Indians. It is a beautiful visionary  and haunting.    6) Across the Board (Slick)  A beautiful but campy song and in true Grace Slick fashion Grace does her best vocally to spice things up. The  lyrics are more than a little suggestive but quite witty.    7) Harp Tree Lament (Freiberg/Hunter)  Co-written by Robert Hunter  Jerry Garcia's song writing partner the title refers to the Bible verse in which the children of Israel are goaded to sing for their captors. It is a somewhat slow down beat song but beautiful.    8) White Boy (Transcaucasian Airmachine Blues) (Kantner)  In this song  Kantner  sums  up  his work and states his thesis which began with the album Blows Against the Empire and which he continues to this very day. It clearly proposes idea that civilization is progressive  and our ultimate future is in outer space and further that we don't really belong here. It is a very thoughtful (and again hopeful) song. In 1973 when other rock artists were questioning the experience of the 60s and a feeling isolated Kantner gives  a more hopeful view.    9) Fishman (Slick)  The lyrics at first blush sound  pretty bizarre but it is actually a love song from Slick to Kantner. Slick's voice is powerful and  she really belts out the  lines.    10) Sketches of China (Kantner /Slick)  Sung by Kantner and Slick and accompanied by oriental sounding rock it tells a bizarre story in picture fragments. There seems to be some word play going on in the song between China the nation and China Kantner (Grace and Paul's daughter). It is ultimately a triumphant sounding song.    Baron von Tollbooth is one of the most beautiful and hopeful albums of the JA/JS opus. In it Kantner and Slick do their best to keep the spirit of the 60s going while focusing their eyes on the stars.    Highly recommended    Jim Connell    \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is the best Foo's album to date.  The opening 5 tracks on the rock CD blow you away and the accoustic tracks are sublime. <br />You must buy this CD it must surely be the best rock album of 2005!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|For those of you who didn't read carefully the info about this version...<br /><br />UNDER info about the first disc, IT IS CLEARLY STATED this is a widescreen version with 17 MORE MINUTES ( meaning extra footage in the movie itself).<br /><br />Before posting useless posts, read the info the way you should read them...
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is truly a great album. It has a sound to it that I truly have never heard before. Best song on the album-Our lady of sorrows, worst song-none, every song is great. I strongly recomend this. Everything starts out with the instrumental invetation, Romance, anf then goes strait to the power punching sound of Honey this mirror isn't big enough for the two of us. Vampires will never hurt you is also a very good song. They lead up to the spectacular Our lady of sorrowsand ending with the soft tune of Demolition Lovers. fans of The Used will devour this.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Seeing as how this is the first MV record I've bought, I was amazed.  They played styles I never could have even imagined.  Though they played so many, it always sounded like the same band, which is a virtue in the music business these days.  It seems like most bands take so much advantage voice effects and conformity that every song sounds like a different band, but with the same music.  Are bands like TMV the new face of prog?  Well whatever they are, this is a great record.  Next time though, a little less dead air and a bit more music?  Cool.
B000002JKA|5.0|I love and worship this band with all my will, heart, and soul and always will, for the following reasons...<br /><br />1. If you want heavy (but not very heavy) metal that can be melodic and have ballads, then turn off this computer, get off your ass, go to the closest music store, and add every single Dream Theater album to your collection. All of their albums have very heavy songs (Caught In A Web on this one), and have ballads (Silent Man on this one).<br /><br />2. I know metal, and I have yet to hear a band that sounds like Dream Theater. Sure, Spiral Architect (my second favorite band) is also ultra-talented, and Ivory Tower has made a career of ripping off their \\"Images & Words\\" album, but these guys are one of the most original bands out there.<br /><br />3. James LaBrie is an amazing vocalist. He can have a deep, barritone vocie, then sound like his privates are in a vice. He also writes some good lyrics, too. Also, he's not THAT bad live.<br /><br />4. John Petrucci is my all-time favorite guitarist! His complex solos and amazing guitar riffs are so awesome they could give Eddie Van Halen an orgasm. Listen to his guitar solo on the live album \\"Once In A Livetime\\".<br /><br />5. John Myung has AMAZING bass-lines, but there's a cache...you can actually HEAR them. Also, he's my favorite bass player; yes, even more so than Les Claypool (Primus), Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Cliff Burton (Metallica)(R.I.P.)<br /><br />6. Mike Portnoy has exellent and complicated drum patterns. IMHO, he's the second best drummer in the world, next to Gene Holgan. His patterns could make Neil Peart (Rush) say \\"Wow!\\".<br /><br />7. Kevin Moore (and later, Derek Sherinian and Jordan Rudess) can produce keyboard solos that sound like messed up guitar solos. He also wrote a lot ofthe band's material before his inevitable leaving.<br /><br />8. If you do not like this band, you will never be cool like me. Go listen to Linkin Park ya wuss!!!!<br /><br />\\"So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you as far as I can throw you<br />and I'm trying to get out of a shadow of a doubt 'cause I don't know if I know you.\\"<br />-Dream Theater, Liea shadow of a doubt 'cause I don't know if I know you.\\"  -Dream Theater, Lie
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Let me first start off by stating that I've been listening to Dream Theater for many years now.  While Scenes will probably remain my favorite album for years to come, I must say that I have enjoyed each studio album for its individual merits. <br /> <br />I will now attempt to give you my perspective on this new release.  I would have reviewed this earlier, however as with all DT albums, you must give it at least 10 or so listens first! <br /> <br />Track 1: The Root Of All Evil -  <br /> <br />Good opener to the album.  As many have already pointed out, this is Portnoy's continued drumming saga that started back from SDOIT.  8/10 <br /> <br />Track 2: The Answer Lies Within - <br /> <br />For all of you people that are upset with this track, look back to albums like Scenes or Awake and notice that some of their best tracks are slower.  While I don't feel this track is as good as The Silent Man or The Spirit Carries On, I still feel that it's a solid track.  7/10 <br /> <br />Track 3: These Walls -  <br /> <br />Easily classic Dream Theater.  It just feels right.  I love this track. 10/10 <br /> <br />Track 4: I Walk Beside You - <br /> <br />The ONLY REAL problem that I have with the album...  It's almost as if this track was designed for radio play, and that aggrevates me.  At a mere 4:29 and with catchy \\"pop like\\" lyrics, I feel that this track was a horrible choice... 5/10 <br /> <br />Track 5: Panic Attack -  <br /> <br />Those who loved TOT will love this one.  Easily DT's fastest track to date, it has a pounding bass line that'll make several listens seem very fresh.  Great summer track.  9/10 <br /> <br />Track 6: Never Enough - <br /> <br />Another great classic DT track.  Don't really know what else to say here.  8/10 <br /> <br />Track 7:  Sacrificed Sons - <br /> <br />This is where the album REALLY picks up.  The symphony here just ROCKS as this dramatic track builds to an AWESOME climax.  One of my FAVORITE Dream Theater tracks of all time.  10/10 <br/> <br />Track 8:  Octavarium - <br /> <br />Can't say anything other than \\"beautiful\\".  I loved this track.  Any prog rock/metal fan will.  Believe me.  The album is worth buying simply for this track.  Clocking in at a whopping 24 minutes, this epic starts slowly and progresses to a roaring and dramatic finish that'll have you longing for more. <br /> <br />All in all, we have classic Dream Theater here people.  I just wish they didn't release \\"I Walk Beside You\\"..... ugh... <br /> <br />Kris Taylor <br />
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|On toxicity S.O.A.D had a number of sick songs, but there's only a couple on this one that are sick. They go too fast in 2/3 of the songs. If they slowed down the music instead of rushing it, then this cd would be a classic. Only buy if your a hardcore fan of S.O.A.D
B000063DFQ|5.0|This Is Iron Maidens true Epic, not Number Of The Beast. This album is so Original and it stands out so much from the other tired old metal bands around at the time like Judas Priest or Black Sabbath. Each song is unique and the tone and mood throughout the album is so diverse. Here's what I think of the song's.    1.Where Eagles Dare (4.5/5)- a great riff, Bruce's vocals go so well with the song  2.Revelations (4/5)- a slow and moody ballad type song, starts of soft and slow and then breaks into a awesome twin guitar melody by Dave and Adrian    3.Flight Of Icarus (5/5)- Based on the greek myth about Icarus's discovery of flight, Classic song  4.Die With Your Boots On (4/5)- Great song, Catchy  5.The Trooper (5/5)- Perhaps Iron Maidens greatest songs  6.Still Life (4/5)- Great Song  7.Quest For Fire (2.5/5)- stupid song about ancient cavemens discovery of fire  8.Sun and Steel (3/5)- the lyrics are stupid but its got a catchy chorus  9.To Tame A Land (3.5/5)- A song about ancient pharoas conquering other lands, this song was meant to be on Powerslave     If you like Hard Rock or Metal definitely buy this album.    If you liked this album you might also like:  Dio- Holy Diver  Queensryche- Queensryche  Ozzy Osbourne- Blizzard Of Ozz
B0006213WG|5.0|Sum 41 continues to wow me and all the other 14 year olds across the planet. This album contains Rolling Stones #17 rock song o the year \\"peices\\" but thats not all, my personal favorites \\"no reason\\" and \\"angels with dirty faces\\" are a kick in the mouth and relentless. Recomended for all ages.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love the fact that just because you can type words in an online forum you believe you are experts in all areas. The modifications in these movies are designed to make the storyline flow as it should. But wait, that's right, people like Mary Parisi (see above review)know more about Mos Eisley than the guy whose imagination created it. Give me a break lady the guy invented all this, this is how he believes it should look. I think he might know a little more about the story than you. Now pipe down and enjoy this incredible story or start your own trilogy. By the way tremendous movies, all three, a bargain at this price.
0634049011|5.0|Tagliarino does something very few authors of guitar books have done - he puts the entire fretboard within reach of the guitar student.  About 99 percent of the guitar players I know panic when they get beyond the fourth fret.  But all of these players absolutely love the guitar and truly desire to learn the instrument - all the way to fret 12 and above.  They have all kinds of musical notes and guitar riffs in their heads, but can't reproduce them on the fretboard.  That is the worst kind of pain. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Tagliarino's method is the \\"wonder drug\\" that takes the mystique out of the guitar fretboard and makes it all come together.  Please be advised however, that getting this book doesn't reduce the necessity of practice. What students should experience is an increased desire to practice more! My advice to any guitar player, or instructor for that matter - get this book and the boxed set of Fretboard Logic (with DVD) by Edwards - and get to work!  Within six months: you, your friends, your students, your teachers - eveyone - will be absolutely amazed at your increased level of knowledge.  Take the plunge and buy this book! You won't regret your investment!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Let me put things this way... <br />I bought Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\" and Beck's latest album \\"Guero\\" on the same day.. Since then, I have been listening to Beck at least 4 times as much as I've listened to \\"X&Y\\"... <br />Explanation: Beck = experimental, ever-changing, kick ass musician... <br />Coldplay = talented band, but...Hmmmmm...Haven't I heard this before??
B0000026VZ|4.0|Another rock group whose big splash was in the 80's was Toto, who peaked at having their album Toto IV and single \\"Rosanna\\" winning Grammies for 1982.  That worthy tune, which spent 5 weeks at #2, being kept from the top spot by first the Human League and then Survivor, sported the characteristic sizzle of Steve Lukather's rock guitar, smooth and soaring vocals by Bobby Kimball, and a horn section for additional flourish as well as some great keyboard work by David Paitch and Steve Porcaro.  Oh, and Rosanna referred to Lukather's then-girlfriend, actress Rosanna Arquette.  Two other hits from that album included the Top 5 \\"Africa\\" with its prominent synth keyboards and the #10 ballad \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" with its orchestral backing.<br /><br />They began with \\"Hold The Line\\" from their eponymous 1979 debut, a #5 hit and an introduction to their signature rock sound, specifically Lukather's guitar.  \\"Georgy Porgy\\" veers more towards adult contemporary with its laid back but brisk morning pop aura, intercut with lines from the old nursery rhyme.<br /><br />The video for the heartbreak song \\"I'll Be Over You\\" was my first exposure to Toto, though I had heard their music on David Lynch's adaptation of Dune.  A line that rang true with me October 2004 was \\"as soon as my heart stops breaking/and disappears/as soon as forever is through/I'll be over you.\\"  This song along with \\"Rosanna\\" are my two favourite Toto songs here.  Michael McDonald can be heard giving backing vocal assistance in the chorus.  This single from their album Fahrenheit, features the debut of new lead singer Joseph Williams, son of John Williams of the Boston Pops.<br /><br />For The Seventh One, Joseph Williams, son of John Williams of the Boston Pops, took the helm as lead singer.  \\"Stop Loving You\\" combined some of elements of their earlier style, horns, electric guitarwork and was snazzy pop/rock.  \\"Pamela,\\" their last Top 40 hit (#22) lacked the oomph of their earlier singles.  Rather, it has watered down elements of \\"99\\", the #28 song from their second album Hydra.  It puzzles me that this did better than \\"Stop Loving You.\\"<br /><br />Of the four unreleased songs here, sung by Jean-Michel Byron \\"Love Has The Power\\" is the weakest, while \\"Animal\\" tries, but fails to bring back the glory of the old days.  \\"Out Of Love\\" is a decent ballad, with that reminder \\"that fools never remember to fall out of love\\" while \\"Can You Hear What I'm Saying\\" isn't half bad.<br /><br />Two years after the release of this compilation, drummer Jeff Porcaro died of a heart attack.  While not a bad compilation, I still think the rocker \\"I'll Supply The Love\\" from their first album should've been included.has watered down elements of \\"99\\", the #28 song from their second album Hydra.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Just got finished watching this, and I came away once again very impressed with the pure muscianship and attention to production. These guys are known perfectionists and it shows. Some say their live performances sound too much like the records, but on this one they spice it up a little more than on Hell Freezes Over, though there aren't many cool acoustic ones like on that DVD. This one is less stiff than HFO too.  Don Felder is missing on this one (out of the band since '01), but the guy filling in does a OK job, though it's just not the same on Hotel California. I thought the best performance was Walsh's Funk #49. It demands to be rocked LOUD in DTS. As with HFO, the recording quality is superb with DTS as the only surround option (just as HFO & Henley's DVD). The Eagles do this as DTS is better than Dolby as it uses less compression, and they can increase the video resolution when the Dolby track is left off.  In fact, I think this DVD sets the standard in sound quality for live mixes.  I have the Hotel California DVD-Audio, and the mix and realism sounds better here due to more available tracks to mix from and it utilizes higher resolution digital recording (though nothing can touch the resolution on a DVD-Audio or SACD).  Overall, there's more songs, and it's more of a rockin' set than HFO. Frey & Schmit look great while Henley, and especially Walsh, are starting to show their age (was that Hermes pajama bottoms Walsh was wearing?). Though Walsh's voice sounds the freshest. If you like great music, buy this. If you have a great sound system, buy this, as it will really show it off and make you glad you spent the big bucks.  As a last note, the Eagles share my passion for wine.  When their manager, Irving Azoff, shared some Lafite Rothschild with them in 1974, they began putting in their tour contracts that first growth Bordeaux would be in their dressing rooms.  Some may say that this is a primadona request, but I can't think of a better perk.
B000001ESJ|5.0|After Rush put out 2112 their breakthrough album their was much pressure on them to put out a album as good or even better. And they did, Farewell to kings was a really good album.
0440211727|3.0|Surprisingly good, considering my first introduction to Grisham was \\"The Pelican Brief\\" (which I rate a 1).  This is Grisham's first novel, and rather well done.  The story is about a young lawyer's defense of a black man who kills his young daughter's rapists.  I'm not a lawyer myself, but the technical parts sounded good to me.  Characters are okay, ending satisfies.  Not a totally gripping tale, but a good solid book.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is not Parachutes. <br />Nor is it A Rush of Blood. <br /> <br />A true fan of this band will come appreciate this album because of those two facts. It's an excellent piece of work from them. Bravo, Chris. <br /> <br />BTW, New Order fans will definitely hear an influence.
B0007XT87G|5.0|All I need to say- ALBUM OF THE YEAR- 2005. Hands down. EVERY SONG KICKS ASS!!!!! wow- so impressed!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|Loved the movie.  People are too critical.  Take it for what it is a wonderful, suspenful love story!  The actors are great!

B0006L16N8|1.0|I really liked Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\".  It is one of my favorite CD's - a rare find that I actually listen to from start to finish. I enjoyed everything from the cycle of crashing dissonance and resolution of \\"Politik\\" to the deep resonant heartache of \\"The Scientist\\" and the hopeful chords of \\"Clocks\\". I honestly felt with \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" Coldplay had created a pop masterpiece and I looked forward to their next release. <br /> <br />Unfortunately X&Y is more like the Chris Martin show than a CD produced by a group of musicians.  There are a number of tracks that open with Mr. Martin's solo vocals in his trademark high-pitched and melancholy style.  I found myself thinking, \\"Geez, what's the fascination with falsetto?\\"  Many lyrics are completely predictable.  Throughout the CD there was also a strong sense of disconnect between the vocals and the band.  It was almost as if the vocals and melody had been laid down separatley from the rest of the music and the instrumentals a mere afterthought. <br /> <br />In a word, this album is \\"eewwwww\\".  Has Coldplay already lost their touch?
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Now, I know this review may seem bias to those who seem to hate DT, but rest assured, I am an life-long DT fan. <br /> <br />So, why the low rating. The reason is that I would only give five stars to one DT album (Scenes From A Memory Metropolis Part II ). Therefore, this albulm must take a lower standing. Many other reviewers have stated that this is not a good album to recomend to a first time DT listener. I must agree. It is no more worthy of being a great albulm then Tales From Topographic Oceans(btw I love that album). Simply put, it is to 'out-there' for a casual prog listener to pick up and immediatly enjoy. Furthermore, the music doesn't seem to flow as it did in other albums. Each song on this album can stand alone as a masterpiece (especially Octavarium, a true prog masterpiece that will stand the test of time), but each seems disjoint from the other tracks. There are attempts to tie the album together, but these symbols are there for the sake of being symbolic. There is no reason behind it. Some songs(more appropriately, sections of songs) are even a little too metal for my tastes, and they throw off the balance of the entire album. If one were to argue that parts of Octavarium sounded like Master of Puppets, I would have a hard time debating that point, flawed as it is. The truth is, I would love to give this album 3 stars, which I feel it more richly deserves. However, when I look at the discriptions for these rating, I must lower my selection to 2 stars. Yes, this is a good album. Yes, it is also non-essential. But when I think of who would enjoy this album most, it is not the average prog fan. This is an album that is meant to be appreciated by DT fans, not an attempt by DT to widen its listener range. Therefore Collectors/fans only is an appropriate choice. Just for all those looking to my review as a reason why not to listen to Octavarium, understand this is a good piece of music and on a purely numerical ranking of 1-10, 10 being the best, this album rates a solid 7.
B00097A5HW|3.0|Thank you Shakira for singing 100% in Spanish. However, this album is short of a great one. Although the lyrics are phenomenal and heart-felt, the music is average pop sung by a great voice. And Cerati's and Sanz's collaborations didn't help out either. Teenage girls, you will love this album. Other adult types, save the money or buy something else.
B00004WKII|5.0|I really enjoyed the rare songs released from the vaults and the pretty jams jimi did live!!,the booklet that comes with it is juicy full of VIBrant pictures of the pychedelic perseusion,very intelligent and accuract,no hendrixs head should be with out this,if your ever feeling,curious see his sound track to Rainbow Bridge, pretty Jam:Pali Gap a slow and sensous song this would be a really good next c/d to this,its way worthy,you can't go wrong,if your like me look 4 live shows from Tapers :} Peace Larry
B0000C9V3T|1.0|I am an avid music buyer and bought this cd as I already owned Kill Bill Vol 2 (excellent) and Pulp Fiction (good).  <br /> <br />Vol .1 was a super disappointment. Except Song 1 'Bang, Bang' by Nancy Sinatra the other songs are not even passable. <br /> <br />Vol 2 on the other hand has excellent filler songs in addition to 3 or 4 top songs. <br /> <br />KB Vol 1 is Completely Avoidable
B00065GX1O|1.0|I agree with the above review by Mr. Santos but not for the same reasons or, at least, the same order of reasons. The fact that the TV director (here is where Brian Large makes all the difference) chose to focus on Placido Domingo more than it should be recommended is bad. But in time we get accustomed and even forget that Placido is there. What we cannot forget and never will, even after months after having seen this recording, are the tremendously ugly, horrific and tasteless costumes and scenery. <br />The concept behind this staging was that if a butterfly is an insect and the heroine is called Butterfly, then she should be dressed as such an insect, antennae and all. And all the other characters, why not, should be insects as well.  That is why Suzuki appears like what seems be a giant moth, Sharpless like a huge kind of beetle, the chorus that enter with Butterfly look like a caterpillar, Goro like a disgusting cockroach from the filthiest gutter, the son Dolore like a ten year old fat and slow lady bug, Yamadori, what can that be? a silkworm? and Kate, what is that? Is she a giant ant or a disproportioned wasp? I don't know, everything is so incompetently designed that it is diffidult to make the correct guesses.  <br />Now, someone could be asking, and what about Pinkerton? Well, aye there's the rub, for he does not have antennae so he is not an insect. Could he be a rat? He is dressed in a black uniform as someone out from Marlon Brando's gang in the film \\"The Wild One\\", only he forgot to bring the motorcycle. He has very black sideburns, a goatee to go with it and he wears a thin ponytail. What can he be? Here I give up. <br />Oh, I forgot to tell that during the \\"humming chorus\\" there appears someone dressed like a black spider and after some slow and demented steps of ballet throws its net over Suzuki and Dolore, not to eat them but to protect them. Then the spider goes away and when the sailors begin to sing she returns and picks <br />its net back.  <br />The sets, or better yet the one piece of set, resembles a part of the desert where Manon Lescaut dies in Puccini's opera. Meaning what? With what purpose? <br />Well, and what about the singing and playing? The singing is good but it gets hampered by the dreadful outfits, with Daniela Dessi having to fight with collars, veils and tails. Fabio Armiliato and Juan Pons, both also excellent singers, deserved a better fate than this. They should have refused to appear so ridiculously dressed. <br />Placido Domingo is there allright but I think he is feeling a little bit ashamed at having to be a part of such a terrible disaster. <br />I don't intend to watch it again and would only wish that Guillermo Mariotto (costumes) and Arnaldo Pomodoro (set) should give my money back
B00005JMEW|5.0|Watching Kill Bill Volume 1 made me feel like jumping. It was just so exciting. Every second of this movie your eyes are popping out of their eyes with excitement. I can't even believe how much I love this movie. I'm not usually this into sci-fi action violece movies. I don't know why But I LOVE IT!! <br /> <br />I highly suggest buying KILL BILL on DVD or UMD today. You won't regret it once in your life. I could not stop watching this movie. It's awesome, no, that deserve caps. IT'S AWESOME!!

B0007PAMR4|5.0|What is this, free? <br /> <br />I hope so; I really want a free DVD.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I was utterly disappointed by this album. The lyrics are easy and lazy. There is no tension and there is a lack of lyricism found on their first and second albums. The guitars and percussion parts are beautiful, but the album doesn't push any further boundaries or explore new avenues. I loved \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head\\" so much they made me cry with appreciation. \\"X & Y\\" makes me cringe in embarrassment for these talented people in such a unenthused and idle state.
0316168815|5.0|I once worked in a children's hospital, and saw too many young lives cut short.  Yet I always wondered, once they had gone to heaven (I believe they all do) if they watched their families back on earth.  Now, obviously, this isn't a documentary, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it is not a guided tour of heaven.<br /><br />For one thing, as Susie Salmon (like the fish) discovers, she finds herself in \\"my heaven\\", where not every soul who ever left this earthly plane ends up, but is more like a neighborhood she would dream.  Parts of \\"her\\" heaven overlap other heavens.  Franny, her intake counselor, gently guides her through her new existence experiences.<br /><br />Again though, this is NOT a novel imagining what heaven (anyone's heaven) is like.  Rather, it is the story of what remains on Earth - her family, her friends, and her killer.  It describes their reactions and their methods for dealing with her death when the world they knew, is forever altered by this tragic event.<br /><br />Her sister Lindsey, who becomes alienated, by being labeled, \\"sister of that murdered girl\\", particularly touched me.  Having people see and compare her physical resemblance to Susie, and finding it eerie and painful, affects her almost as much as the death itself.<br /><br />Then there is Ruth, a girl in her class who had only been a casual acquaintance, yet whose life is forever altered by Susie's fleeting touch as her soul left this Earth.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with her mother's behavior, but I can see how her reactions evolved.<br /><br />For such a morbid, gruesome subject to be handled so tenderly takes real talent, and I commend Alice Sebold for her deft touch.  When the last page is read, (I read the softcover version which included essays and comments, which was a nice way to ease out of the world of the narrative and come back to my own reality) I was left with a different and unique take on death and mourning, that was neither sugar-coated or horribly depressing.<br /><br />I have two teenagers who also read the book, and when I asked them for an opinion, they both said it was a good book, and \\"made them think\\", yet they smiled when they said it, and I smiled, and thanked God they were here to smile at me.oated or horribly depressing.  <br /> <br />I have two teenagers who also read the book, and when I asked them for an opinion, they both said it was a good book, and \\"made them think\\", yet they smiled when they said it, and I smiled, and thanked God they were here to smile at me.
0143057189|1.0|My wife and I have really gotten into learning more about the world and societies during dinner time.  We listen together and review the cd that we just listened to and talk for hours upon the subject with some pretty heafty conversation and contraversy. We could not wait to listen to the cd's every night. Collapse did the opposite.  My wife and I just finished listening to CD 2 of 8. I fell asleep on both CD's!  I was fully rested on both of the disks on 2 seperate nights. Good thing I was not listening in the car. My wife started surfing the net on the second cd, not because it sparked any thought but more over boredom.  If you are not a professor of palm trees or a scientist of pollen dating, you will find this book absolutely boring!
B00097A5I6|4.0|This album flows nicely starting with \\"Turn Up the Sun\\", a catchy song that sounds similar to Lyla at points.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" has another catchy sound, with a harmonica and piano backing up smooth vocals.  \\"Lyla\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" are probably the best songs on the album.  Oasis has put out yet another underrated mix of songs.
B00006RINF|5.0|I first heard of Lacuna Coil On another Cd i bought, The MTV2 Headbangers ball Cd. So After Hearing The Song \\" heavens a lie\\" I decide to go out and buy it.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Let's face it, the main problem with X&Y is that it lacks that elusive Coldplayish atmosphere we always loved them for. Another problem is that Mr. Martin seems to have forgotten that his name is Chris, not Bono.  <br /> <br />Their wonderful epic/melancholy sound is gone never to be seen in this world again. It still lingers on tracks like 'Square One' and 'Speed Of Sound', though. But for me it's just not enough. 'What If' and 'White Shadows' are undoubtedly inhabitants of the U2-land. 'Fix You' could have saved the day, but again, it's nowhere near the shimmering beauty of 'The Scientist'. It shines on X&Y, but would've been just an average track on A Rush Of Blood...  <br /> <br />'Talk' is poor, really. I love Kraftwerk, but even their memorable riff can't save this track. 'Speed Of Sound' is okay, but it's just not 'Clocks'. And it would never be, because of it's polished, synth-soaked sound and that 'radio-hit' sticker. The psychedelia is replaced with strange 80s-like atmospheres shining through Edge-influenced guitar riffs. <br /> <br />'Swallowed In The Sea' is another tell-tale type of ballad. This one is really good and is like a breath of fresh air after 'Low' and 'A Message'. <br /> <br />All in all, X&Y reminded me of U2's latest effort, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. It's a strong pop-rock release with several good songs, but...I'm disappointed. Maybe it would grow on me as time passes, but right now I'd like to listen to 'Parachutes' and 'A Rush...' instead.  <br />
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I am a hardcore fan of bob dylan, and most of the time, I read the lyrics before hearing the music. Sometimes accidents happen and I hear the music first. Such was the case with \\"This year's model\\", and the music really got into me. I read the lyrics later, not that deep, nothing magnificant there...but the delivery was perfect. Elvis costello's style is almost unimitatable, he has such a unique way of singing that is completley his, that makes you really believe that he really means what he is saying. And you can even dance to some of the music in here!! Really great stuff, now I cant sleep before hearing every song from this guy......
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is really a breakthrough for Coldplay. It solidifies what we already knew about them, that their superior artists. \\"X&Y\\" is a breakthrough because it's mature, refined, and distinct. This may be their first step towards excellence. If you can get past your own assumptions and expectations, then \\"X&Y\\" can be a rewarding journey. This CD is a rare treat amongst a sea of uninspired. It is one of the best albums I've ever heard. They have done something special and tangible with \\"X&Y.\\" If you're ready to see and experience it, then you'll get there.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is worth the long wait! X&Y is pure genius and Coldplay seem to be just getting better. Coldplay showed how they can make great passionate love songs with their first two albums \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\"  and with X&Y they show how they can write really good rock songs. <br /> <br />Favorites: <br />Really, I LOVE this WHOLE Album! BIG Improvement over the first two, and gives an opprotunity for Coldplay to do something different.  <br /> <br />X&Y will be an instant hit with everybody and Coldplay will just get more fans within the hour! Coldplay should come out with a B-sides/Rarities album that is an official release next <br /> <br />For those people who stomped on this album, you should get your heads kicked in for not appreciating talent! This is a great album! <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has been my favorite band ever since their 1st CD.  When I 1st lisnted to X&Y I thought It wasnt their best.  We took it with us on our boat trip over the weekend, and everytime you listen to it, the more and more you love it.  Some people need to give it a chance.  Coldplay is a very talented band, I would recommend buying their new album. =)
B000092Q4U|5.0|Sure, it was New American Gospel that brought Lamb of God a small, but fanatically dedicated fanbase. Sure, it was Ashes of the Wake that really brought the band into the spotlight, but this is by far LOG's best work.  <br /> <br />Usually that time in the middle is where bands are weakest, right after making it into the ranks of their genre of music and right before hitting it big time. This is Lamb of God's most overlooked album, and deserves more light than the puny amount that has been shed on it. My iTunes couldn't even find the track names! (leaving my lazy butt to enter it all in myself) <br /> <br />In short, if you are a fan brought into the screaming, wailing arms of the Lamb of God by AOTW, pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Ever since I saw \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"The Others\\" I knew I had to see the coming works of Alejandro Amenabar. Also, having followed Javier Bardem since his early days with Bigas Luna and Pedro Almodovar, and after his extraordinary performance in \\"Before Night Falls\\", any new project he did was something to be reckoned with. Fate brought Barden and Amenabar together for one of the most touching movies since \\"Big Fish\\" (for me at least).<br /><br />The story of \\"The Sea Inside\\" (\\"Mar Adentro\\", in Spanish) is based on the life of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro. His story could be the story of any of us. An unfortunate accident when he was young left him paraplegic for over 30 years. During this time, besides composing some beautiful poetry and dreaming of flying toward the sea while staring out his window, Sampedro battled the system to get permission to have an assisted death (euthanasia). Unbelievable moments abound in the movie, which will shock you, make you cry and make you ponder, such as his statement in response to the Jesuit priest that came to visit him to talk him out of his decision: \\"Una vida sin libertad, no es una vida.\\" (A life without liberty is not a life).<br /><br />One thing is for sure. Whether you agree with the statements made in the movie or not, Amenabar has definitely done it again (as the director, co-writer, co-producer and scorer for the movie). And so has Bardem, with a role that easily stands out as the best his done in his life (so far). \\"The Sea Inside\\" is without a doubt a masterpiece of modern Spanish cinema.
B00005LOUP|1.0|IF I WERE A 14 YEAR OLD I MIGHT JUST ENJOY THIS TRAVESTY. <br />WHEN I WAS YOUNG, WE'D GO SEE A MOVIE AT THE IMAX THEATER IN HOUSTAN. AND THE PREVEIW FOR THE MOVIE CAME UP. IT WAS A TOTAL FRIGHT. STICK WITH MIKE MYERS: THE CAT IN THE HAT. HE'S THE DR. SEUSS CHARACTER WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.
6304140428|2.0|Sometimes a work of literature appears which is right for its time, but not for subsequent ages. This is one of those. I'm not afraid of Virginia Woolf, but I am afraid that this is a very boring play. It is dull, long-drawn out, repetitive and wholly unedifying. Marriages aren't like this any more, if they ever were, although they might have been in the early 60s. The people are completely unbelievable, quite unreal. The production is extremely stagy, contrived, mechanical and clunky, although it's obvious that a lot of work went into it. I never saw what was supposed to be so fantastic about Elizabeth Taylor, who seems to me a plain and dumpy little person and a mediocre actress --- at best. The dialogue lacks wit and imagination: four very ordinary academics get drunk and irritate each other, and the audience. They display nothing of their assumed erudition in history and biology; in fact, they might as well have been high-school teachers, or management accountants. There is no plot, and very little character development. A sensation in 1966, merely numbing forty years on. Watch it once if you must (I thought I was going to see something remarkable) and then consign it to historic oblivion, along with Proust, Henry James and the rest of the tedious crew.
B0006L16N8|5.0|When I first listened to the CD from beggining to end I was a bit dissapointed. I didn't find many of the songs distinguishable like AROBTTH was. But a week later and now i'm loving the CD more than the two previous releases and have learned to love every single song. My favorites off the album would have to be \\"Square One\\", \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"A Message\\", and \\"Twisted Logic\\". Coldplay have definately established themselves, in my opinion, as THE rock band of our time and have proven that with three consecutive albums that are simply breathtaking. Thank you Coldplay for being the saviors of rock and given me hope for the future...you guys are the BEST! <br />
B000002HAJ|5.0|\\"Wish\\", quite simply lies at the peak of the creativity of Robert Smith's The Cure. Considered by most as an incursion by the band into commercial territory (think \\"High\\", \\"Doing the Unstuck\\", \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" and \\"Letter to Elise\\"), it also happens to house some of Robert Smith's greatest songs.<br /><br />On a rather upbeat level, along with the tracks accused of being commercial, lie the extraordinary \\"From The Edge Of The Green Sea\\" and the uptempo \\"Open\\" and \\"Cut\\". To counter the effect of these songs, and accomplishing a perfect balance are \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\", \\"Apart\\" and \\"Trust\\", three of Robert Smith's most beautiful songs ever.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, over thirteen years after its release \\"Wish\\" still leaves an indelible and fresh mark in your heart with every listen. I can recommend it without doubts. Own it to get on a natural \\"High\\".
B000929AJQ|4.0|Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, and Downward Spiral tugged at me in the heart.  The Fragile tickled me in the brain.  With Teeth triple-suplex-roundhouse-flying-dragon kicked me in the gut....and it felt good. <br /> <br />Although by listening to it you can tell it is Reznor and it is NIN, it is undeniable that this album is not like his previous works.  It seems to me to be more....\\"in your face\\" than anything else.  A trait which is not necessarily bad so long as it is done well, and I feel it was in this case. <br /> <br />A friend of mine said she wasn't a big fan of this album because it didn't have a story, a mood, a defining theme like his previous albums.  She said, \\"He just threw together some random songs and burned them onto a CD and said to the public 'here ya go, hope you like them.'\\"  After thinking about her statement for some time I came to two conclusions: <br /> <br />1) She's right. <br />2) I don't care, it still sounds good. <br /> <br />If you have ever listened to any NIN song in your whole life and said \\"this ain't bad\\" then that means you are open to Reznor's style and you should definately give this album a chance.  When compared to his previous albums, I will agree, it is not his best.  When compared to the rest of the music on earth, or when just judged on its own merits alone, this is a very good collection of music and worth buying (well, ok, at LEAST worth checking out). <br /> <br />Based on that, and the 1 minute long silence (well, if you have headphones on and have the volume up you can hear a faint piano and Reznor saying \\"I cannot go through this again/alone\\".  If you are, however, in your car with a window down or have the volume at anything other than ear-shattering decibal levels, it is essentialy silence) in the middle of the track \\"With Teeth\\", this gets 4.5 stars.  Since Amazon won't let me rate it 4.5, it gets a 4.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This is amazing! It really is, it's something I have waited for since 2002 and now it's here, not any less good than I expected. Shakira is the perfect pop-artist, no mistaking. Every album brings lots of new cool stuff, a great deal of diversity, exploring of new styles, but the funny thing it Shakira always remains herself, she never gets lost in all the publicity and attention. This is also very much the deal on Fijacion Oral Volumen 1. I'll describe the songs: <br /> <br />1. En tus pupilas (In the pupiles of your eyes), a very relaxed song with great melodyline and very beautiful singing. In thechorus Shaki sounds a little like Bjork. This could be catagorized as Latin-ballad <br /> <br />2. La Pared (The wall), an upbeat kinda 90's songs, beautiful lyrics and powerfull singing. <br /> <br />3. La Tortura (with Alejandro Sanz) (The Torture), this song really had to grow on me, but now I like it very much. It's upbeat Latin with a little reggaesound. Alejandro's voice sounds raw and very honest. <br /> <br />4. Obtener un si (Obtain a yes), jazzy Sinatra-like songs, very special with a real string-quartet. Shaki's exploring new stuff. <br /> <br />5. Dia especial (Special day), this song was co-written by Gustavo Cerati, the leadsinger of the argentine band Soda Stereo. It's a nice song, with acatchy chorus. <br /> <br />6. Escondite Ingles (Hide and seek), one of the two tracks on the album that were fully written by Shakira. It's kinda punk-rock. Very cool. <br /> <br />7. No (No), this will be the second single from the album. It's a ballad in the line like Underneath your clothes, T and Te Necesito. Nice song, cool lyrics. Also with Gustavo Cerati. <br /> <br />8. Las the de la intuicion (Those of intuition), a dance song. It has astrong beat and very cool verses. The chorus is a real blow out of your speakers, very cool. This song sticks in your head. <br /> <br />9. Dia de enero (January day), this song was fully written by Shakira and dedicated to her fiance Antonio de la Rua. It's like En tus pupilas, but with lesser instruments. It's very relaxing and melody is great. <br /> <br />10. Lo imprescindible (The essencial), a cool song where the singing might not always be beautiful, but it shows a lot of strength and perhaps anger. Very powerful <br /> <br />The other two tracks are different versions from La Pared and from La Tortura <br /> <br />Overall, definately worth it's five stars, listen to it, it's amazing. Mostly I recommend En tus pupilas, Obtener un si, No and Dia de enero. ENJOY!
B000002H38|5.0|When Anita Baker sings \\"You Bring Me Joy\\" it sounds like a wondrous gospel song!  So rich and fulfilling, she lets it all out in this one!!  \\"Been So Long\\" has deep smokey tones alternating with gorgeous highs and everything in between.  Anita proves with her loose and free vocal that she is truly a jazz diva!  On \\"Mystery\\" Anita soars into a vocal bliss!  The emotional tones in \\"No One In The World\\" rise into the stratosphere!  This is an exceptional vocal and the ultimate love/blues song!!  \\"Watch Your Step\\" is a hot, upbeat song.  This cd is one of Anita's soulful best!!!
B0002S94OS|3.0|This album could be so much better, but most of this album is pretty much just one track all the way through. There's not to much individuality in the songs, which lost a lot of credit from me. However, these guys are amazing live. I'd definitely check them out if they play near you. Favorite songs- \\"The Faded Line\\", \\"Laid to Rest\\", and \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\".
B00007J4SI|1.0|Recorded in the mid '70s , this 'CD' has as much hiss as piano on it . What piano there is , is slightly distorted and far too bright . <br />This is the complete catalogue , but , honestly , you'd be better off with midi files . <br />I can't believe a record company actually released this **ap . <br />Reminds me of those old 'classics' the tobacco companies used to sponsor in the seventies . <br />Except , most of the collection sounds like it was recorded on an early Phillips cassette recorder . <br />Cigarettes are better value than this product .
B00005JMEW|3.0|Way overrated! Too much violence and gore, though I was not suprised. The action and karate might be good, but it is totally unrealistic for one lousy person to beat over 30 people who happen to have far more experience in karate and the martial arts. When those Japanese stormed in to fight Uma Thurman, how is it that she is able to beat all of them?!!!!!!!!! By herself?!!!!! With one lousy sword?!!!!! No! Totally unrealistic. Then all the chopped off limbs and legs and body parts were just disgusting and gruesome. The movie was okay, but not all that like they made it out to be.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that not many albums deserve 5 stars, in my opinion. That said, this is a very good album. I think the first Gorillaz album was very overrated. It had a lot of mediocre rapping, it was inconsistent, and there weren't too many catchy songs.  <br /> <br />For the most part, \\"Demon Days\\" succeeds where the first Gorillaz album failed. There's a consistent, brooding vibe to the album that becomes more prominent with repeated listens. Even underneath the most catchy songs, it's there. What's great about \\"Demon Days\\" is that much of it sounds like party music, but there's a more cerebral element that makes it interesting to listen to more closely. The sound is a unique mix of dub and 80's electro, but it's twisted just enough to make it seem refreshing and new.  Comparisons to the Clash are accurate only in the sense that Gorillaz combines a lot of disparate sounds into a new whole-- it doesn't really sound like the Clash. <br /> <br />There are only a couple of flaws. There's still some mediocre rapping that harms a couple of otherwise great songs (although thankfully less than the first album). I like hip hop, but it just doesn't fit with this sound. Danger Mouse's production far surpasses the Automator's but he over-does it in a couple of songs. The first few songs are more stripped down, basic rhythms and they sound better than a few of the overproduced songs towards the end. But this is a minor complaint overall.
B000063DI9|5.0|Ok, I have been listening to Maiden since Killers, I own every one of their albums including their live shows, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is undoubtedly my favorite.  The title track is undoubtedly the best in the album.  \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" starts out with about four minutes of vocals and instrumentals, but the last six minutes of the song is purely instrumental.  A true Maiden epic!  This is Maiden's best instrumental piece since Phantom of the Opera, and is my favorite Maiden song, period.  Other tracks to check out are \\"Can I Play with Madness, \\"Infinite Dreams,\\" and \\"Only the Good Die Young\\".  If you are a true Maiden fan you should love this album, as it is one of their best.  So go get it...now!
B000002U82|5.0|Greatest album ever recorded besides WIsh you were here, Led Zep IV, and Houses of the holy.  Every track is greatm especially Time, Us and Them, and the two closing tracks Brain Damage and Eclipse.  The othere stuff is good too, us and them is a nice slow song, about war i believe.  Money has great sound effects and a nice solo by Dave gilmour.  Waters wrote great lyrics and Rick Wright's keyboarding is absolutely breathtaking.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I am a huge Sarah McLachlan fan, and I love her more live. This album is an example of pure talent. A lot of artists today do not sound near as good live as they do in the studio. Sarah is a HUGE exception. Her voice seems so much more alive, haunting and sexy when she is singing live. She sings like an angel and the crowd is digging it. <br /> <br />Mirrorball is a compilation of Sarah's many popular songs that were recorded live at Lillith Fair. The song 'Possession' sounds 100% better live than it ever did on \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\\" It sounds funky and Sarah and the band rocks out. 'Hold On' and 'Good enough' are just impossible to beat when compared to the studio recordings. One of my favorites is 'Ice Cream.' It is such a sweet, but simple love song. 'Angel' and 'I Love You' still leave chills up my spine when I listen to them. Sarah channels such emotion into her voice. <br /> <br /> The Fans excitement on this album makes the music so much more exciting to listen to. This album belongs in any Sarah McLachlan fan. It is an excellent Live album. If you tend to be partial to Live recordings, you will really love this album. So, enjoy it.
0767817478|5.0|HOW CAN ANY BODY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE IT HAS A BIG LIZARD DISTROYING NEW YORK AND IT LOOKS ALMOST REAL. TALK ABOUT ACTION GOING TO A NEW LEVEL. THIS MOVIE MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST CAST BUT WHAT MAKES UP FOR IT IS SEEING ARMY MISSILES FIRING AT THE MOSTER MISSED AND EXPLOIDES BUILDINGS, AND TAXI CARE INSIDE IT'S MOUTH AND RUNNING ON THE BROOKLIN BRIDGE.
B000002KCV|4.0|If you're a fair-weather Neil Young fan, this is a great album to have.  If you're not, this is a great album to have.<br /><br />Obviously not a timely review since the disk is pushing 30 yrs old (oy!), but still one that stays in my rotation on a fairly regular basis.<br /><br />No real Crazy Horse moments: lower key, mostly acoustic set. Nicolette Larson weighs heavily on this diks, singing harmony on all but two songs.  She worked so well with him (here, 'American Start & Bars' and 'Harvest Moon') and kind of kept Young in check on his vocals.<br /><br />Ironically, Larson doesn't appear on \\"Lotta Love\\" which she made a hit (actually both this disk and her disk came out the same day). And it's not that great of a song in either version.<br /><br />The stand-outs for me are \\"Look Out For My Love\\", \\"Four Strong Winds\\" and the title track...but all the rest are pretty darn good.<br /><br />It's a disk that has really stood the test of time.  But a lot of Young's work has.
B0009IW88A|4.0|First, put away your expectations that Zimmer and Howard try and top Elfman's iconic score from the 1989 film.  They don't. Like the film itself, they opt for an entirely different focus and direction.<br /><br />If you know any movie composers' styles at all, there are sections that a very Hans Zimmer-esque, as well as some passages that bear a resemblance to Howard's score for Unbreakable (a vastly under-rated film, IMNSHO).<br /><br />But it's also not typical of either, and it does really resemble a horror film score more than anything. I don't mean that it's chock full of ear-bloodying sound effects, string screeches or cymbal crashes. It's very dark and murky, and much more about setting a tone than it is about creating a memorable theme or motif.<br /><br />Don't mistake me; there are \\"sound effects\\" or strange musical intonations on the score; a recurring sound is a pounding, echoing percussion sound, like a thunderous heartbeat. It fits, and pulses darkly and pulls us into the music.  But this is not a grating or garish sound, and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the score.<br /><br />The CD does feature moments of pounding action (\\"Molossus\\"), but they are scattered (or, more accurately, carefully placed) throughout the score. Similarly, there are stretches of achingly lovely strings (\\"Eptesicus\\"), evoking a deep sense of loss and sadness.  Like Zimmer's score for Backdraft, though, this is really meant to be hear as one long piece.<br /><br />I still recommend it for film score lovers, but it is much better as background or tone-setting music than it is for focused listening. Whether you're home reading the latest China Mieville novel or driving on a summer night as a storm moves in the from the west, it's good stuff.<br /><br />BTW, the tracks are all named for various kinds of bats; it's a gutsy move on WB's part that helped me love the music. They really took pains to make this _different_.
0790729652|4.0|I remember when the trailer for Batman first hit theaters in 1989.  It's the first time I had ever seen a crowd cheer wildly just for a trailer.  Batman was highly anticipated.  His popularity had been sky-rocketing in the comics with  stories like \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" by Frank Miller.  Anticipation turned to apprehension when it was discovered the film would be directed by Tim Burton whose biggest achievements at the time has been the comedies Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetle Juice.  Further causing fans consternation was the selection of Michael keaton to Play Batman.  Again, Keaton was a guy known for comedic roles such as Mr. Mom, Gung Ho, and The Dream Team.  One stroke of casting genius was Jack Nicholson as the Joker.<br /><br />Burton gave us an image of Gotham that was a Dark, gothic, art-deco that while set in modern times had the look and feel of a 40's noir-ish film, right down to the fedora-wearing gentleman.  The movie opens with a couple and their son taking a short cut through an alley where they are murdered by a couple of thugs in a nod to Bruce Wayne's own experience as his parents were murdered years before.  Unfortunately Burton felt the need to have Nicholson's pre-Joker character of Jack Napier as the one who killed Wayne's parents in a totally unnecessary tie-in.<br /><br />Keaton ended up doing an admirable job as Batman.  Keeping his look grim and dour and nearly whispering in his best Clint Eastwood style voice.  Unfortunately the combination of the stiffness of the bat suit and perhaps a bit of Keaton's lack of athletic ability, we really don't get the kind of hand-to-hand fighting action that Batman was known for in the comics.  We get a couple of brief fighting scenes and then the climactic showdown with the Joker in a Sky-Scraper sized Cathedral.  In retrospect, Nicholson may have been a bit too old to play the Joker which maybe should have gone to someone a bit leaner.  Not much help was added by Kim Bassinger who wasn't remotely believable as photo journalist Vicky Vale.<br /><br />On the plus side, Michael Gough made a fine Alfred and Pat Hingle was good as comissioner Gordon.  Jack Palance as crime boss Grissom was good in a small role.  Wildly out of place was the funky music of prince against this dark, gothic setting and it accompanied some of the films more campy moments such as the Joker and his gang vandalizing an art museum.<br /><br />Visually the movie looks fantastic. The performances are ok and the relatively plotless script was only average.  Unfortunately style over substance would become order of the day for the three Batman sequels which got progressively worse.  I think all Batman fans have great hope for the new Batman Begins to return the character to greatness.motely believable as photo journalist Vicky Vale. <br /> <br />On the plus side, Michael Gough made a fine Alfred and Pat Hingle was good as comissioner Gordon.  Jack Palance as crime boss Grissom was good in a small role.  Wildly out of place was the funky music of prince against this dark, gothic setting and it accompanied some of the films more campy moments such as the Joker and his gang vandalizing an art museum. <br /> <br />Visually the movie looks fantastic. The performances are ok and the relatively plotless script was only average.  Unfortunately style over substance would become order of the day for the three Batman sequels which got progressively worse.  I think all Batman fans have great hope for the new Batman Begins to return the character to greatness.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Movies like Napoleon Dynamite are an inspiration to me. In a time when the big studios of Hollywood fear originality and rely on cheesy remakes, a movie like Napoleon Dynamite provides a breath of fresh air. It's just a hilarious film that's hard to explain. The best you can do is just to tell others to see it. Normally when it comes to things of this nature when I fall in love with a movie, I usually contribute it to my own weird tastes. After all my two favorite heroes are Ernest P. Worrel and Pee-wee Herman. But no, I've come to find there are thousands of fellow Napoleon Dynamite fans out there. The official Napoleon Dynamite fan club itself has over 200,000 members! With those kinds of numbers, do you really wanna risk missing out?
0671027344|5.0|I am guy that doesn't read too many books, and get easily bored by just about everything I read.  So, to say that I bought this and read the entire thing in one sitting in saying a lot (if you know someone with ADD, imagine them finishing a book in one sitting!).  It is simply a great story of a kid's life and how he figures things out.  The way in which the story is told (by letters) also reveals different facets of the story that would not normally be evident if told in a typical novel fashion.   <br />I highly, highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good book to read.
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown's book \\"Deception Point\\" is a very good novel on all accounts. I highly suggest you read it if you are into the mainstream high-speed action novels Brown is known for. If you read \\"Angels & Demons\\" or \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" you will like this book but I doubt you'll like it better than either of those. The book had a few nice twists and turns and good action but I found the end very upsetting. This weak and cheap happy ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and gives the book overal a feeling of \\"ehh.\\" Still, uptil the last 15 pages it is very satisfying. Pick it up.
B0006L16N8|4.0|The thirt album of this good british band, it's great. It's a mix of 2 last albums. The band is groing up. This album sounds mature. The voice of Chris Martin sounds great and better from de latest album. The guitar  of Jon Buckland sounds in the same style of The Edge from U2. In a few words sounds great. The drums sounds quite repetitive like the bass. And the keyboards of Mr. Martin are great. <br />When you listen the song 1 to song 9. You think ... This album it's better than the last album. But ...when the track number 10 begans to the track 13 and the extra track. This album quickly going down. In the final chapter of this album sounds repetitive ... in the same sense of the last REM albums. <br />But the album it's good. And the music sounds mature. <br />This album contains some of the Coldplay best songs. <br />
B00097DX3U|2.0|Since I heard that Audioslave was coming out with a new album considering how excellent the first one is, but then I heard &quot;Out of Exile&quot;.  For some reason the album lacks something, although the Tim C and Tom Morello are awesome musicians, but they weren't represented well with this album. However, the new Audioslave lacks the soul the original did, it sorta sounds like they went through the motions of playing; Or perhaps it was the more limited involvement that Rick Ruben had in the production of the album.  The album is disappointing considering who the band members are, some of the songs are almost unlistenable.  Although I still consider the group a super group, in my opinion they just put out a sub-par album.  Hopefully, they just fell to the old sophmore jinx as most bands do; guess we'll see with the 3rd album.
B000002KO3|5.0|It's hard to talk about this album in comparison to some others that I've reviewed. It's unlike anything I've encountered listening to music.  <br /> <br />It starts with a song called \\"Born Under Punches\\", which acts as some kind of experimental funk meets new wave kind of song, with David Byrne giving what sounds like a sermon, as the rest of the band keeps the hooks with eerie sounding harmonies. I love the powerful, ominous vibe that this song has with its exciting polyrhythmic percussion work, it's excellent instrumentation, and the great vocals by Byrne and the other Heads.  <br /> <br />\\"Punches\\" is  my favorite song on the album, but that's just a matter of personal preference. The next two cuts are just as solid, with all the great elements of the song above. The driving polyrhythms are faster in the second track, \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\" and even more so in the third \\"The Great Curve\\". Byrne shows more skill as a lead vocalist with these two tracks, less sermonizing and more actual singing. Just as much as on the first track, the influence of the backup musicians (such as Adrian Belew of King Crimson on guitar, and Bernie Worrel and Steven Scales of Parliament on keys and percussion) is strongly felt, and definitely elevates these tracks to their maximum, funky potential. <br /> <br />Half the quality of this album rests on the Talking Heads' decision to allow outsiders to take part in its making. The session musicians elevate not only the record but the sound of the Talking Heads in general, transforming them from a rather awkward-sounding art-school new wave band into something utterly unclassifiable. Throw into the mix Brian Eno, the producer who cowrote most of the album with the band, and we see the music elevate itself to even greater heights. <br /> <br />Eno's influence pokes its head out as the album continues into its most well known song \\"Once in a Lifetime\\". With its memorable verses (\\"This is not my beautiful house!\\") and impossibly catchy chorus, it is a great centerpiece for the album. It also was one of the Talking Heads' biggest hits. <br /> <br />The album takes a sharp turn at this point, in the least expected place. A slower, mellower song called \\"Houses in Motion\\" comes next. Now is as good a time as any for mellower songs, but don't excpect another upbeat danceable number like \\"The Great Curve\\". From here the album moves into the ambient territory that its producer is known for. It makes for more compelling listening than what is generally offered by the Talking Heads (which is saying a lot), while being perhaps more accessible than Eno's work. It still features funky backing tracks, courtesy of the extended backing band, but the sound is more subdued.  <br /> <br />This continues for three tracks, each song mellower than its predecessor, until the last song, \\"The Overload\\". This is an ambient song which sounds like the producer is just experimenting with as much noise as he can be. This is basically what he's doing, too, but it doesn't matter, as it really makes for an interesting listen. Sure, you can't dance to it, but it's definitely keeping in the spirit of this albums originality and tendency to push the envelope. In my opinion, the album couldn't really be closed off with another dance song like the first four tracks, because it would be quite difficult to top those first four. Better that the daring, interesting album close with it's most daring and interesting song. <br /> <br />Even if this album had nothing but \\"Born Under Punches\\", \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", and \\"The Overload\\", it would still be remembered as a classic. The only downside is that the Talking Heads' other work pales in comparison, which is a shame because they have a few more high-quality albums which may or may not become irrelevant compared to this behemoth of an album. Basically, this album should be heard by everyone whether they want to hear it or not, because at the very least it'll make them understand why the Talking Heads are so revered.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I saw Metropolis quite a few years ago on VHS. I didn't know much of the history of how it had been cut up and that large sections had been removed for the American release.<br /><br />What a vast difference in that old VHS copy and this Kino DVD release!<br /><br />It was almost like watching an entirley new film.<br /><br />  I especially enjoyed seeing the extras which included a bit of the technical aspects of filming some of the effects at that time.<br /><br />If you are a fan of silent films, and especially of Metropolis, this is a must have.<br /><br />If you are a film buff, then it's at least a must see movie.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|I am so sick of people saying, \\"I like the bands earlier work better.\\" How stupid can one be? Do you honestly think a band will just produce music that sounds the same, do you think a band does not want to try new things? Well with that said, In Your Honor is amazing! I could not ask for anything more, If it were the only cd I had to listen to for the rest of my life, it would be this. I honestly love every song on both discs. So all you Foo friends go and buy this album ASAP, and don't listen to the naysayers, listen to the disc and you will find what I believe to be one of the best rock albums ofour times!
B0006213WG|4.0|I bought this album almost when it came out last November and now i have decided to write this review. Wow I tell you when i look back,I ask myself, How could a snotty and downright bad band like Sum 41 write such good music? Well they have matured since their debut Half Hour of Power and All Killer No Filler. They have shown another side of themselves, a more serious, melodic and politically motivated one. I still have the opinion that Does This Look Infected was better than this album. I worshipped DTLI and thought it was an amazing album and had the realese date for Chuck marked on my calender. Since DTLi was released in 2002 i was waiting for two years for a new Sum album. I was happy to get it and loved most of the songs. I was dissapointed thought when i learned of the....similarities with other songs. Take Pieces and Coldplay's The Scientist. Same chord progression. hmmmmmm. All in all, it was a solid album with good songs but like the title says, get some originality like was seen on DTLI! Buy this album or DTLI or Megadeth's The System Has Failed
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is another wonderful CD by Coldplay, and it's a must have for your collection. I think this is their best CD yet. Go ahead, buy it, you will not be disappointed.
1401301010|4.0|Being the pretty drugs-naive 15 year old girl that I am, this book really told me the stuff about drugs that my teachers never did. Like what happens when you shoot up a shot of acid dissolved in vodka. Apart from the drugs aspect of this book (which is quite a large chunk of it) Scar Tissue is a very funny, emotional, enlightening book that would probably be a great read even for someone who doesn't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers (unlike me!)
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Why can't I put this into my Ipod after I spent $18 to buy it this morning?  I love this band, but this has really made me lose alot of respect for them.  I should be able to listen to this in my ipod since I BOUGHT IT LEGIT!!!  Total B.S., don't buy unless you want this travesty shoved down our throats by the record companies and bands that don't care about their fans.  Dave, Taylor & co: \\"Way to \\"keep it real\\" guys!  Thanks alot!\\"  You have lost a fan.    POSTSCRIPT: I love the music, I just hate the copy protection.  I cannot listen to this on my iPod and that tempers the review. Sorry!
B000002KFJ|4.0|- I think the very first album I ever purchased was Black Sabbath's Vol. 4.  <br />But as far as their whole catalog is concerned, I rank <br />Sabotage as possibly their best work, both technically and artistically. <br />The music is very a very skillful soul-searching kind of early <br />Metal that, for the time, had a different sound than previous <br />recordings - although - let it be said that I also consider <br />Sabotage as almost a \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath Part 2\\" release. <br /> <br />The two recordings go hand in hand. I often listen to one right <br />after the other as some sort of my own little mini Sabbath rock <br />opera. <br />Ozzy's voice is in prime form on Sabotage...Bill and Geezer <br />lay down a solid foundation over Tony's blistering guitar work. <br />I love each and every cut on this album. But highs would have to point to  <br />Hole in the Sky, Symptom of the Universe and my personal <br />favorite - The Thrill of It All - which is in my humble opinion, <br />one of the most well written and produced songs that Sabbath has <br />ever released. The flow of the song is just amazing. <br />This is the best Sabbath album that nobody has ever heard.  ;)  <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|I absolutely loved Audioslave's self-titled debut. It was one of the best rock CDs released in a long time, and as successful as the album was, I still don't think it recieved enough recognition. For those of you that don't know, the group consists of Tom (guitar), Tim (bass), and Brad (drums), all of which are from Rage Against The Machine. And on vocals, is Chris Cornell from Soundgarden. I'm a big fan of both groups, mostly Soundgarden.<br /><br />This time around, the members claimed that this new album would sound a lot LESS like Soundgarden-meets-Rage. But ironically, I think this album sounds MORE like Soundgarden than the last album. Songs like \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" sound just like something from SG's \\"Superunknown\\" days, and \\"Heaven's Dead\\" sounds like something from Temple Of The Dog (the Soundgarden / Pearl Jam side-project from '91). Tom Morello's guitar style is not as similar as it was on past albums from Rage or Audioslave, except on songs like \\"The Worm\\". But most of the songs still carry Tom's wacky signature solos that sound more like a turn-table than a guitar. Overall, the band sounds a lot more classic rock-ish. If you listen to songs like \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" or especially \\"Dandelion\\", you'll think that you're listening to an old Led Zeppelin album. In my opinion, I think it's great! I'm sick of all these new alternative groups who are getting away with making hit songs without being able to sing or do guitar solos. Audioslave puts those groups to shame.<br /><br />To sum up, this is a great album. Give it more than one listen though, because I actually wasn't that impressed with it until my 3rd listen...now I can't stop listening to it. If you liked their last album, than you should like this one to. I would definitly recommend it more towards the Soundgarden fans than the RATM fans.<br /><br />BEST SONGS:<br /><br />Drown Me Slowly<br /><br />The Worm<br /><br />Man Or Animal<br /><br />Doesn't Remind Me<br /><br />Your Time Has Come<br /><br />Be Yourself
0156027321|1.0|I read the reviews on Amazon, so it was with great anticipation that I started this book. The beginning is quite tantalizing, background on the teenage Pi, and his exploration of 3 major religions, his family's adventure to move to Canada via a steamer.  What a great set-up!  However, once the teen leaves India, in my opinion, the book slows down and bogs down into minutia that seems to have little to do with moving the plot along. How many ways can you describe how to kill fish?  You will discover it in this book.  I felt bludgeoned by the author in all the grisly details of killing and death over and over again.  There were a several leaps of faith required by the reader to follow the plot.  The greatest leap of faith I could not make was the book's promise, \\"You will believe in God\\": I didn't.   I felt as though it was a bad remake of the Old Man and the Sea with more grisly elements of Lord of the Flies.  I had mentioned I read the book, (without saying my opinion of the book), I was surprised by the  the comments I have had from my own circle of book lover friends and co-workers: \\"...book was so boring I couldn't finish it...\\",  \\"...I just lost interest and couldn't finish it...\\", \\"...book was disappointing...\\".   I have yet to find a single person, outside the reviewers here that actually have anything positive to say about it.  My apologies to the author, I really really wanted to like this book, but just couldn't.
B000002B35|4.0|Great quality 2-CD live 1994 performance of the band's second post-Roger Waters U.S. tour. The setlist could be better, but that's alright. They had a new CD, 'Division Bell' out at the time. 'Pulse' appears to feature most if not the entire 'Dark Side Of The Moon' album. Tracks I liked hearing again the most were the vintage \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Keep Talking\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Another Brick In The Wall (Part Two)\\", the stellar \\"Great Gig In The Sky\\", \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and the encore \\"Run Like Hell\\". Saw this very tour and it doesn't look like they'll ever be back in the states as such. Comes with a miniature hard cover (that's right, hard cover) booklet with many fantastic photos and facts of this unforgettable event. Exclusive packaging. Long live Floyd!
0452282152|4.0|\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\", set in the 1600s, is a masterfully written piece.  Chevalier paints a beautiful picture with her words, character development, and quite believable storyline.  Even if the reader is not familiar with Vermeer, Chevalier weaves in fact and fiction well enough it reads like a story book and not an art history lecture. <br /> <br />What I enjoy about this book and also in \\"Falling Angels\\" is that she writes in the mood of the era.  The reader comes to feel Griet's embarrassment and awkwardness when faced with even the slightest intimacy with men.  Many other authors would exploit those scenes, but Chevalier is true to the mood and spirit of the era and writes those scenes eloquently. <br /> <br />I wished she had been able to add more to the story to make it longer.  I think it would've made the end more climactic.  That would be my criticism of the book.  That is why I only gave 4 stars.  It was a compelling read and I am very glad I read it.  I did not find the movie as compelling, unfortunately.
0767817664|5.0|In my opinion, the best vampire movie ever made.  The characters are very personable, the plot (if not original) wildly entertaining, and the music (for 80's fans anyway) nostalgic.  The special effects are top-notch, but the movie doesn't rely on them to provide thrills and chills.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't I wish I could jump into this movie and be one of the characters.  It's that good.  Really.
B0009IW88A|5.0|The steady climbing string music in the first teaser trailer was definitely not Danny Elfman but unmistakably \\"Batman.\\" James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer have tried to collaborate on a film but scheduling issues prevented them from doing so.<br /><br />Howard, still fresh off the success of The Village, provides the emotional setting of the film capturing Bruce Wayne's feelings of loneliness and anger. Zimmer, mostly known for his action scores, provides the - what else? - action cues for the film and, like always, he does not disappoint. Gone from the score are the main Batman Theme and comical sounds of the previous scores. This score is dark, creepy, action-packed and sometimes subtle.<br /><br />\\"Vespertilio\\" is the opening track containing the music during the opening logos of the film. The sound effects shifts from one channel speaker to the other almost giving a \\"bat-flapping\\" feeling to it.<br /><br />Throughout various tracks Howard's and Zimmer's talents shift between one another almost seamlessly giving the score a \\"solo composer\\" voice feel to it.<br /><br />My personal favorite track is \\"Molossus\\". It starts with a bang of percussion, continues pounding for a while before it is joined by the rest of the \\"ensemble.\\" The brass begins the accompaniment followed by the strings further adding to the tension before the main theme begins. After the main theme makes its appearance, the action continues with great underscore accompaniment in Hans Zimmer fashion.<br /><br />A good example of a subtle track is \\"Corynorhinus\\". It's mainly played by a solo piano accompanied by a \\"string ensemble.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this album is a great fit to the latest Batman movie. This soundtrack definitely belongs next to the Batman and Batman Returns albums on your shelf. At a little over an hour long, there's plenty of music to go around. You will not be let down . . . unless you wanted an Elfman score. Keep in mind this is mainly an ELECTRONIC score not an orchestral score.
B00005B238|5.0|This is an awesome movie I liked this movie so much it's just such a good movie and I especially liked the part where the one guy looks strait at the Predator sees the wigly sight of a cloak then before he knew what hit him ppssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh his whole facial area is gone Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha mess with a Predator you get a hole blown strait through the middle of your head.As you could probably geuss I was rooting for the Predator I even rooted for him against The Governator and the Aliens. well that's all I have to say about this movie
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Even though I usually only write music reviews on amazon.com, I just felt obligated to say how awesome this movie is.  The acting is superb all around, as is the dialogue, which turns what could have been an over-the-top and ridiculous premise into something believable and somehow strangely familiar.  Set in the fictitious late 1980's suburbia of Middlesex, this film at once stuns you with its accurate portrayal of family and social life in such a locale, and it extends itself beyond the cliched boundaries of typical suburban teen dramadies (for example, Donnie's father is not a complete jerk).  This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, drama, tragedy, suspense, and even comedy into one eclectic yet effective amalgam that grips you from beginning to end.  Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly believable as Donnie, a teen suffering from what seem to either be psychotic hallucinations or ominous visions of a six foot tall rabbit named Frank, who upon their first encounter informs him that the world will end in \\"28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds\\".  This meeting occurs late one night, when in some sadistically sardonic twist of fate, a jet engine plummets from the sky and lands right on Donnie's room.  Fortunately, he is not there at the time because Frank has drawn him outside, and thus \\"saved\\" him from what was sure to be an extremely unpleasant demise.  Because of this fact, Donnie feels indebted to his new \\"friend,\\" and follows any instructions Frank gives him.  This leads to no small amount of trouble in Middlesex, as Donnie becomes increasingly reckless and unstable, much to the dismay of his parents (skillfully played by Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne) and especially his gym teacher Mrs. Farmer, played with an effective amount of self-righteousness and obliviousness by Beth Grant.  The rest of the cast is spectacular as well, especially Noah Wyle as the cautiously helpful Prof. Monnitoff, Drew Barrymore as Donnie's sympathetic English teacher Mrs. Pomeroy, Katharine Ross as Donnie's caring psychiatrist Dr. Thurman, Patrick Swayze as oblivious self-help guru Jim Cunningham, and most of all Jena Malone as Donnie's troubled girlfriend Gretchen Ross, who becomes one of the only things keeping Donnie going.  As the movie progresses, Donnie begins to feel more and more isolated, his only sources of solace being Gretchen and a book given to him by Monnitoff called \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" written by Roberta Sparrow, a local recluse whom Donnie and his friends lovingly refer to as \\"Grandma Death\\".  With the aid of both Monnitoff and Sparrow, Donnie believes he has discovered the secret of time travel.  All of these characters and plots converge on one fateful Halloween night, causing Donnie to finally lose it in one of the films most heartwrenching and chilling scenes.  In the end, Donnie makes an extremely sad, but somehow optimistic decision to, ah, well, you'll just have to see the movie.  Along with all the magnificent elements already defined, this movie features several other things for which I must commend it, the first of which is its soundtrack and score.  Utilizing a combination of popular songs from the 80's and a stellar, beautiful, and melancholy score of instrumental works by composer Michael Andrews, this film is appealing on more than one level, which is more than I can say for many movies.  Another thing which I must take the time to acknowledge is the extremely realistic and effective subplot involving a student named Cherita Chen (played very well by Jolene Purdy) who is teased by her classmates for being overweight and foreign.  This sad scenario is all too real in many schools, and is brought into the spotlight in this movie with a haunting and sorrowful authenticity.  Overall, director Richard Kelly has outdone himself to say the least (especially considering this is his first movie), and one can only hope that he continues to manufacture material of the same caliber as this.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, then by all means do so:  I can honestly say that it is one of the best films I have ever seen.  (NOTE TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT: I know there is some debate as to whether the entire movie was real or just Donnie's imagination, and I just have to weigh in on this matter:  The jet engine that crashes through Donnie's room obviously came from the plane his mother and sister were flying in when it ran into the wormhole that manifested when the end of the world was set to occur, so therefore he must have discovered the secret to time travel in order to allow himself to go back and alter the course of time and restart the entire thing.  Just my thoughts.)
B0006L16N8|5.0|This was exactly what I needed. Coldplay has changed it up slightly for their 3rd release. And it makes for great entertainment. As much as others want to claim that nothing will be better than AROBTTH, I would have to respectfully disagree. X&Y is better. Some will cling to AROBTTH for all eternity. That's all well and good, but it's time to move on to something bigger and better. It's called X&Y. <br /> <br />Why some would dismiss SQUARE ONE, WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, TALK, SPEED OF SOUND, TWISTED LOGIC, etc., as being less than their AROBTTH predecessors is beyond me. While Coldplay's new songs are standing and soaring, the prior are just sitting comfortably. Some have accused X&Y of being boring. If so, then what's supposed to be exciting? I have many of the so-called popular albums this year, and X&Y sings circles around all of them. People just like hating on Coldplay because they feel they can.  <br /> <br />You should give X&Y a chance to grow on you. Give it some time. I liked it immediately and I'm not a Coldplay disciple. Even if you're not really into Rock, X&Y should be something that most could digest rather easily. It's quite refreshing. <br />
0425152251|5.0|Philosophy wasn't the type of subject that thrilled me the most in school until I started reading \\"Sophie's World\\". I think it was because philosophy was a subject that I didn't quite understand that easily, but now I absolutely love philosophy. The book is so unique because it merges the world of philosophy with a storyline. This is one of my favorite books because not only does it describe philosophy in a nutshell, but it also engages the reader by describing a young girl's journey into a whole new world of thinking.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 is one of those cds that you have to listen to multiple times to really understand. She begins the cd with \\"En Tus Pupilas\\", a slow but beautiful song about love. However, this is a shock because her first single is \\"La Tortura\\", a rock/latin song. What I mean is this cd is nothing like the first single. This cd is slower. I really expected a cd with more fire. However, that doesn't mean this cd is bad. I love \\"La Pared\\" because her voice sounds stronger and more passionate. \\"No\\" is another favorite, but my favorite song is \\"Obtener Un Si\\". That song reminds me of the 1940s and Sharika proves her voice is a force in itself. I also love Shakira's songwriting. This is a good cd, but Shakira's best cd remains \\"Donde estan los Ladrones?\\" Let's hope her English release (in Nov) is better. From what I hear, she is more political on that one. <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I am a long time dream theater fan and at my first listen, the album was pretty much mezzo mezzo.  The only songs that really stood out for me was Octavarium and Sacrificed Sons.  Everything seemed to sort of just pass by.  I popped the disc in for another listen because I wasn't totally satisfied and I thought there was still hope because all good albums sometimes take time to like.  After the second listen, i was really digging it alot more and now I really can't get enough.  Really, every track is good, minus never enough.  Though it is a good song, the ripped off of muse.  Otherwise every track is good.  I dunnno if it will be as timeless as images and words, SFAM or Awake, but it is certainly miles ahead of TOT and it seems like a step in the right direction for DT.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Finally after three years, Coldplay has released a new album.  X&Y shows that Coldplay is expanding their sound and continuing to make great music.  The two best tracks are \\"Speed of sound\\" and \\"Swallowed in the sea.\\"  The album is filled with music full of emotion and Chris Martin's beautiful voice.  Really the only problem I had with it was trying to figure out why half the tracks are labeled X and half are labeled Y since there really isn't a major difference between them.  Other than that it was weel worth the wait.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|\\"Waking the Fallen\\" focuses on Avenged Sevenfold's greatest strength. That, of course, would be performance, and the band delivers with unflagging precision and aggression. Never mind the lyrical discontent or throat-scraping yowling; there's more to the music than generic cliche. When he wants to, M. Shadows can passionately project in a way that turns the grim \\"Desecrate Through Reverance\\" into an almost bouncy little melody. And whether attacking a riff in unison or in harmonized parts, the double-threat guitars of Synyster Gates and Zachy Vengeance do their duty like search-and-destroy commandos -- in and out fast, leaving devastation in their wake. Especially noteworthy -- and note-heavy -- is the guitar solo that blazes through the last moments of \\"Second Heartbeat\\" and the head-spinning single-stroke skills of drummer, The Reverand.    1.Waking the Fallen - 5/10  2.Unholy Confessions - 10/10  3.Chapter Four - 9/10  4.Remenissions - 9.5/10  5.Desecrate Through Reverance - 10/10  6.Eternal Rest - 8/10  7.Second Heartbeat - 9/10  8.Radiant Eclipse - 7.5/10  9.I Won't See You Tonight Pt.1 - 6.5/10  10.I Won;t See You Tonight Pt.2 - 7/10  11.Clairvoyant Disease - 5/10  12.And All Things Will End - 4/10    Total - 90.5/120  or 7.5/10
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 returns with their hardest sound in years.  Not since the early nineties has U2 been so electric on an album.  \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"All because of you\\" and \\"Love and peace or else\\" are great rock songs.  And the rest of the album is a terrific mixture of pop and soul.  So I was surprised to see these mixed reveiws.  While it's not a classic U2 album like All That You Can't Leave Behind it's certainly worth listening to and enjoying.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Five years ago, Universal commemorated the 25th anniversary with an excellent DVD release, loaded with extras. Two versions were actually released (one had a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, the other had a DTS 5.1 mix), but everything else was the same.    Now, five years later, they've released the 'definitive' DVD edition for the 30th anniversary...    So what's different? Not the video transfer - it's the same as the 25th anniversary DVD.    The 30th anniversary DVD DOES have more audio options: it includes BOTH the Dolby Digital AND DTS 5.1 mixes. Even better, it includes the original mono soundtrack, which has never been issued on DVD before. It also has 5.1 mixes in Spanish and French, and it has new subtitle options, also for Spanish and French.     As for the rest, there are more bonuses. The 25th anniversary edition was a single DVD - this 30th anniversary edition is two DVD's, and the extra disc can now accomodate the full-length \\"Making of JAWS\\" documentary that originally ran for two hours when it was first released on the LaserDisc edition of JAWS (which is long out-of-print). A truncated, one-hour version was used for the 25th anniversary edition. It's an excellent documentary, worth seeing in its entirety, but if you're already well-versed in the making of JAWS, you may be underwhelmed. Furthermore, you can probably rent the bonus disc on this 30th anniversary DVD through Blockbuster of Netflix, so if you're only going to see it once, that's the way to go.    Also new is a 9-minute featurette \\"From the Set,\\" included on the first disc. Produced in 1974, you get a few words from the cast, crew, and Spielberg as they film JAWS, but it's not very interesting. There's also a nice 60-page commemorative booklet (the 25th anniversary edition had a very skimpy booklet), an added movie poster gallery on the bonus disc, and a new bonus feature called \\"The JAWS Phenomenon\\" that looks at how JAWS was marketed around the world. They also add one extra deleted scene (very minor, it features Quint, shortly before they set sail in search of the shark), which is placed on the first disc with the other deleted scenes.    Some of the minor bonuses from the 25th anniversary edition have been ditched for this new edition, including a trivia game, a \\"Shark World\\" educational piece, a screensaver, etc., but otherwise everything else on the 25th anniversary edition was carried over to this new edition.    So, who should buy this new, 30th anniversary edition? Purists who absolutely prefer the original mono mix, viewers who are much more comfortable with Spanish or French, viewers who want JAWS on DVD but do not own it yet, and die-hard fans that already own countless editions of JAWS for the sake of collecting. For everyone else, if you already own the 25th anniversary edition, save your money and skip this.
B00097A5I6|4.0|I've been listening to Oasis for a while now and it seems like every major review has either compared them to other bands or accused them of not being original.  They are obviously influenced by other bands, but after so many great albums they have proven they deserve their fame.  \\"Lyla\\", \\"The importance of being idle\\" and \\"Let there be love\\" are standout tracks and Oasis is continuing with the great sound they rediscovered on Heathen chemistry.

B0002858YS|5.0|This album blew me away.  I had no idea there were new bands out there still playing great music and mixing in 80's influences.  \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody told me\\" are great songs, but \\"On top\\" and \\"Jenny was a friend\\" were tracks that really surprised me with their magnificient lyrics.  Overall, this is the best rock album I heard that year and am really looking forward to the next one.
B00004U28G|5.0|The director qand producer are both giving out the commentary and at times they deliberately joke off (specially the producer) for example the producer claims a little boy seen in one shot is actually him as a kid! The producer was in fact over 30 years old when he made this film! I found the commentating duo referring to Jackie Chan as pretty a little fairy fine. Maybe they were trying to be way too politically correct about human racial races (not car races). The commentators laugh a lot too. As for the film itself. It is not that dated and everybody performs well (though Reynolds is not as involved here as in Smoky and The Bandit he does good all the same).Farrah Fawcett is undeniably one of the most beautiful and interesting females the world over as she shows here. Excellent outtakes too in the closing credits too.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay has clearly fallen into a deep creative hole. 'Rush to the Head' was aptly named as that's the effect that outstanding piece of work has had on the band. X&Y is tiresome melodic noise repleat with overdone falsetto and obtuse, trite lyrics. The hype machine is working overtime on this one, so climb aboard with the others; I did. Buy the ticket and take the boring ride..
B00003CXB7|3.0|He mentions at one point segregation of races in America and says it is still going on (in 2000 when he recorded his commentary). Huh? Ever since at least the early 90's segregation has been more than absolutely gone in the USA. On other areas of his commentary his views are usually fine. Like when he says that a real medical doctor was hired as technical consultant on the film.
B0009IW88A|5.0|This is very, very different from the Elfman scores 16 years ago.  Very different.  While Elfman's stuff was very colorful and thematic, this is very atmospheric and moody... almost angry.  Although I do miss a traditional \\"theme,\\" there are a number motifs that appear repeatedly throughout the score, including at least four \\"bat wings,\\" deep, ominous sounds reminiscent of the wings of a giant bat.  <br /> <br />All in all, I can say that this is far more mature than the music from Elfman...  It captures the character to greater degree.  I fear that a lot score fans will not care for it because it lacks traditional comic-book style elements, but it would work extremely well in any D&D game as a result. <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|Personally, this is the album that made me a devoted Beatles fan. John Lennon's edge along with McCartney's breadth produced an album that will infinitely last. The team may have had its problems personally, but the comraderie of the duo certainly translated well into the music on this album. Lennon over the years was known to set his own standards musically, socially and politically and McCartney has continued to get his message across. <br /> <br />McCartney once again has followed his philosophy... (summed up in his personally written story in Stephanie Lerner's Book, \\"Kids Who Think Outside the Box\\")...To Thine Own Self Be True.  In Sgt. Pepper's, you feel that his was the beginning of McCartney committment to personal excellence and has followed suit in all of his work.  He was included with over 30 \\"living legends\\" who have changed the world in this book (worth buying).  McCartney started changing our world with Sgt. Peppers and has continued wowing us for the last four decades.
B000000XCF|5.0|Incredible that (not counting \\"Mardi Gras\\" which is best forgotten) the period during which CCR ruled the rock universe lasted just over two years.  But during that period, they released six excellent albums - four of which (from Bayou Country to Cosmo's Factory) stand among the greatest rock albums ever.  That's a feat that's difficult to comprehend in an age when most artists take 2-3 years between releases and are lucky to have three or four really good songs on each.      One of the tricks, of course, is that each of these great albums had 10-12 songs that clocked in at a total time of about 30-35 minutes (someone was paying attention to the Beatles).  But, most important, was that these guys played ferocious gutbucket R&R in a period when bands, like fellow Bay Area alumni The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, were taking the youth of America on a totally different trip.  And, in that fertile period, \\"Willy\\" has to stand out as my favorite.      This was an ALBUM, when that meant something.  There is a cohesive feel to this album that works seamlessly.  Even \\"Poorboy Shuffle\\", a consciously sloppy blues shuffle, works perfectly as a bridge between \\"Cotton Fields\\" and \\"Feelin' Blue\\".  \\"Down On The Corner\\" and \\"Fortunate Son\\" (which Rolling Stone once deemed the greatest rock song ever) were the (desrvedly) smash hits from this album.  Everything else, excepting Effigy, is every bit as good.  \\"It Came Out Of The Sky\\" may be a bit silly lyrically, but I can't think of a song that gives a better adrenaline rush blasting out of the car stereo.  But one of the greatest accomplishments here is that they took a couple of Leadbelly tunes and made them sound as if they were always meant for a group of white boys.  This was accomplished while demonstrating the greatest reverence for the music.    CCR kept the flame of roots rock burning brightly, long before the tentacles of corporate rock could prevent music this fresh and exciting from reaching the mainstream.
1573223026|3.0|Count me in as one of the original members of Nick Hornby's overbearing fan club...I passed along \\"About a Boy\\" to about, oh, 10 people.  I'll read anything the guy publishes (short stories, edited collections, etc.).  But \\"A Long Way Down\\" disappointed me.  Oh, sure, there are flashes of Hornby's pop-cultural brilliance.  But, on the whole, this latest release ranks well below my personal favorite (\\"About a Boy\\") and *everyone's* favorite (\\"High Fidelity\\").  If you're hooked on Hornby, this isn't the book you'll want to give to friends to jump-start their interest.
B00006GFAB|4.0|This CD is awesome. It has almost all of Kiss's best songs. The reason I gave it a 4 star rating was only because they are missing a few of the better tracks like God of Thunder. But Overall this CD Rocks!
B000006OBQ|5.0|Never have I listened to a CD more than this one!  You can tell by the opening song, \\"Come Fly With Me\\", that this was a night to remember.  Sinatra's flirtatious rendition of \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\" is priceless.  You will know why he's always associated with being a womanizer when you listen to this song.  The energy he brings to the CD makes you apart of the crowd he's performing to.  You feel right there, along with the wiseguy to your left, and the pretty madame to your right. <br /> <br />Moreover, the first few times I listened to him sing \\"One for My Baby\\" gave me chills right down my spine.  But to remind you what an exciting and fun night it was, he quickly follows it up with another classic, \\"Fly Me to the Moon.\\" <br /> <br />Nothing on this CD captures the moment like track 9, Sinatra's monologue.  This was one of the best monologues out of the 2 weeks worth of concert monologues he gave at the Sands.  He was charming, honest, poignant, and flat-out funny!  And the crowd loved it, too!   <br /> <br />(From what my memory recalls...) <br />\\"You know, people ask me, 'does Dean Martin really drink?'  Well, let me tell you right now.  He's a flat-out, unqualified drunk!  If we had an Olympic drinking team, he would be the coach!\\" <br /> <br />Other times, he would talk about his upbringing, his life as a kid working as a river catcher at the docks.  \\"This guy couldn't hit a bull's fanny with a bag of rice!\\" <br /> <br />His monologue reminds you why Sinatra is Sinatra. <br /> <br />If you are a Sinatra fan, and would love to own a gem that gave insight to Sinatra's life, personality and performance on stage, this album is the crown jewel.  Not only is this album in my cd changer, it's on the top of the list on my iPod. =) <br /> <br />P.S.  For those who think that Sinatra and his music is for one-time Bobbysoxers and the (now) mature, think again.  I am 22 years old, and although most of my peers do not share this interest in Sinatra, I wish more would.<br /> <br />For those looking for Sinatra swingin' at his best, pick up \\"Songs for Swingin Lovers.\\"  Every song on this album is a hit.   <br /> <br />For those looking for early Sinatra crooning and swooning, start with \\"Falling in Love With Frank Sinatra & Tommy Dorsey.\\"  Then you might want to move on to his Columbia years, \\"Portrait of Sinatra: Columbia Classics.\\"  There are many, many more albums to choose from, but these albums, you can listen to over and over again and appreciate Sinatra in the 20s, 30s thru 70s, 80s.
0140042393|3.0|The two words that best descibe John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are long and dry. Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting. Also, in my opinion, the ending was somewhat sick and twisted.<br /><br />So if you're in for a long read with a lot of symbolism, the Grapes of Wrath is the perfect book for you. Otherwise,I would recommend a lighter, more interesting novel.

B000929AJQ|4.0|For me, NIN has been about hurt, disappointment, anger. Pretty Hate Machine was mostly about HER and what SHE has caused. I was the most amazed 12 year old when I discovered these things through Trent. Broken was just that: broken with anger, with hate, with FEELING. No other album, by no other artist, has been able to convey feeling as clearly and directly as Broken. The Downward Spiral got listened to more than even The Wall. So many lessons to be learned there. NIN was growing with me. I was growing with NIN. I won't even begin to describe The Fragile. If you have heard it, then you know. If you haven't, then I can't help you. Go hear it. The Fragile will be remembered in centuries future as Bach is today. More than a masterpeice- a showcase of what is possible. Music was invented with the intention of it being perfected into The Fragile. <br /> <br />With Teeth is a great album. The soundtrack for Natural Born Killers was a great album. But neither of them are NIN albums in my opinion, whether or not Trent produced them (Yes, Trent did NBK). With Teeth does not follow in the Nine Inch Nails tradition of successing previous albums. It does not expand on the previous works. Progressing from Pretty Hate Machine through Broken and The Downward Spiral to The Fragile was like progressing from simple math through algebra and finally calculus. With Teeth is not a continuation of the trade in that sense. <br /> <br />With that said, I repeat that With Teeth is a great album. With the exeption of one (or two) songs, it is an amazingly moving album. In contrast to previous NIN works, it is trendy. I didn't like that at first, but I give Trent Reznor credit for expanding my musical tastes. This bit of trendiness grew on me. <br /> <br />I'm writting this review because I heard a dentists' drill today. It got me singing Sunspots. I think that says enough.
B0002ZMITY|5.0|First of all, a brief disclaimer... if you're a fan of the series... you'll probably be disappointed.  Gags and storyline take the place of Ali G's unique trademark... interviewing the top talking heads of our generation and getting them to say the most ridiculous things imaginable (My first dose of him was he was interviewing an expert on terrorism and managed to get him to complate how the government could prepare for terrorists crashing a train into the White House...) His victims think they're interviewing a new type of young journalist in touch with the young generation...  the ongoing question being is are they playing along, or really victims of the joke.  That said...<br /><br />As stupid as the concept would seem, this movie is hillarious to the point of brilliance... and by hillarious I mean that even after multiple watchings its still funny.  Beyond the low ANIMAL HOUSE/Howard Stern type humor (which IS funny in itself ) the film is conceptually held together by simply presenting Peter Seller's BEING THERE charactor as a wannabe b-boy - - In doing so, the film is able to have MTV Jackass type humor with a coherent story to boot... the film never ceases to be hllarious.  Contrary to the misconception of some that Ali G is parodying hip hop culture, the film sets asides all doubts of who is charactor really is....  a white boy who lives with his mum, and who's entire world is an MTV music video fantasy.  Cohen's parody sheds ridiculous light on the phenomena of (often) spoiled and bratty suburban white kids pretending to be black and from the hood...  If you've ever wittnessed the strange phenomena of 14 year old suburban mallrats who are just about as gangsta as teflon and Lawrence Welk and unlike a real \\"gangsta\\" could easily be tamed with a good dose of ridlin and a nice slap across the face (causing their oversized boxer shorts to fall down) this film will crack you up.  - -  The only worse than this are the over-aged30/lives with mum breakdancing old school hip hop fan/wannabe's of which Ali G's is also \\"representin'\\" - - I wouldn't call the film better than Austin Powers or Wayne`s World, but the parody and satire are way up there...  This is definitely a surprize winner !ol hip hop fan/wannabe's of which Ali G's is also \\"representin'\\" - - I wouldn't call the film better than Austin Powers or Wayne`s World, but the parody and satire are way up there...   This is definitely a surprize winner !
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This CD is absolutely incredible, Dave Grohl has never seemed so confident or seemed to enjoy himself more than with this album. Dave's heart lies in true rock and this CD shows it. Not only is DISC ONE incredible, DISC TWO comes to show just how talented this band really is. It's hard to find and band that has the ability to successfully make cd's in such different genres. Electric or Acoustic, they will amaze you, and you're doing yourself and the Foo Fighters a disservice if you don't take the time to listen to and purchase \\"In Your Honor.\\"  <br /> <br />I'd also like to add that is abosolutely a disgrace to compare the foo fighters, let alone Dave Grohl, to Nickelback and Chad Kroeger! Dave Grohl is one of the most talented human beings I have ever seen, he was an incredible drummer in Nirvana, then managed to be an amazing singer, songwriter and guitarist. Chad Kroeger will never reach Dave Grohl, because he is not nearly as good. <br /> <br />As for the Copy Protection, how can you be so mad? This CD was proclaimed by the Foo Fighters as thier definitive work, and letting it be copied across the internet is a disgrace. Besides that, I imported the CD into my computer just to see if you guys were right, but it imported right away. So stop with \\"Don't buy this CD, because the man is keeping us down!\\" Shut up and listen to one of the best albums you'll ever hear. <br />
0060922583|5.0|Extremely cerebral. Heavy reading for the beginner. But I recommend it as a first read because it covers so much ground in one book. Think of it as a table of contents with brief explanations and references. Then when you are prompted to do further research go find the referenced book or article for further study.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, I find that it doesn't necessarily take a stand on a contested theory. Rather it presents all avenues with references, along with the pros, cons, short comings, and \\"the next question\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an incredible miniseries. It seems no expense was spared in recreating a historically accurate setting. The casting and character development is exceptional, and the directing is superb. Each episode is introduced with snippets of interviews with actual members of easy company, which served as a potent reminder that the seemingly unbelievable events depicted did indeed happen to these men. Im glad that such a work has been accomplished because it is a vivid reminder of what the greatest generation did for our country, and we as a nation should never forget it. Especially in the world today, when it is easy to forget the underpinning values of our country, it is important to reflect back upon those virtuous qualities of the heroic men and women who won the war for us. I would definitely recommend purchasing this miniseries.
0060589272|5.0|Actually, I was quite shcoked when I found that Paulo Coelho also wrote this kind of book (the others being mainly about pursuing your dream), but I gave it a shot nonetheless, and I wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, I think that this is one of the best books that I've read. <br /> <br />While some people may complain about its lack of details and other physical aspects, that's precisely the reason that makes this book a great reading. Paulo Coelho really knows how to explore his character's mind, and leaves me afterwards pondering its implication. For example, when Maria went to have fun, and she thought that this life can either be a merry-go-round or a roller coaster. And I think, hey, I've never thought that way before! Tell you what, I even copied Maria's diary into mine, so that when I feel that I want to think about life, then I know where to turn to.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I must say, I'm a relatively new Foo Fighters fan. I joined in on One By One with the big hits All My Life and Times Like These and loved the album. I know it's not a diehard fan favorite but it's certainly not bad music. Now with this album I'm even more impressed with the Foo Fighters. So much so that I've worked on getting their three previous albums before One By One. If you are a new fan like myself, you'll love this album and no doubt be enticed to buy the others. If you're a die hard fan then you'll love this albums polish and great variety of songs.  <br /> <br />Dave Grohl has certainly done well here. He does what he does best on the rock album with his rough voice and pounding lyrics. On the acoustic album he shows he can do more than just rock out and the special guests fit wonderfully. I won't make any sort of reference to Nirvana here because both he and the Foo Fighters should be put in their own category. This is Grade A Foo loving material here and no one should take that away from Dave or the band. I can't wait to see what other singles they pull out and if they make another funny music video with Jack Black and the like. Shell out the money for this one folks, it's going to be a classic.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|For any of you who have not yet seen this movie, see the defintive action movie of the 1980's and the movie that jump started Tom Cruise's career. In oevre of Tom Cruise, this is the flashpoint of his father/son complex flickswith the now old hat story of a son unable to live up to his father's legacy. There are great performances here, especially Val Kilmer's immortal \\"Ice Man.\\" This is also strangely enough one of the only times you get to see the lovely Kelly McGillis (what ever happened to her?) The chase sequences are top notch, the cinematography is amazing, and the score is perfect. This is a class act, must own DVD.
B0002TRSO0|5.0|I have not been excited about an album in a long time.  I love it from beginning to end.  Not only do the lyrics reach deep, the music has an amazing ability to soothe.  I recommend this to anyone.
B00064WSN2|3.0|Like the previous \\"remastered\\" version, the title song still clocks in at an abridged 7:56, not 8:26 as on the original LP.  So we still don't have a definitive edition.
B000063V8T|4.0|\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" season five is a satisfying season of episodes well worth owning, though like previous seasons it's hardly perfect.  In fact, this set seems to feature three distinct groups of eight or so episodes each: a group of excellent episodes (\\"Darmok\\", \\"The First Duty\\", and \\"The Inner Light\\" among them); a group of good/very good episodes (the Spock two-parter, the cool \\"Cause and Effect\\" time anomaly show, \\"The Masterpiece Society\\", etc.); and a final group of barely fair or outright poor episodes (\\"Imaginary Friend\\" and \\"Ethics\\" come to mind here).  But even the not very good episodes are somewhat easier to take on DVD, as the really nice picture and sound and lack of commercials make them go down a lot easier than when they originally aired, or when they're seen now in re-runs. The extras this time out continue to be excellent, and are especially noteworthy in this set because considerable time is spent paying tribute to Gene Roddenberry, who had died during season five's original run.  Anyway, if you've been picking up the previous boxed sets of this series, there's no reason to stop now.  There's plenty of entertaining, thoughtful fun here.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Whether or not it's true that M. Shadows really did rip his vocal chords; he said in an interview it wouldn't affect his screams at all, he said he would sing more on this album because A7X was tired of being lumped together with all of the less gifted Screamo/Hardcore kids when they (A7X) are obviously 1,000 times more talented. This album proves that; although his voice takes a little getting used to, this album has some of the best instrumentals on any album of 2005; they really stepped up their game to show what they're all about. \\"City of Evil\\" is a tribute to the fact that screaming didn't make this band what it was, but rather it was the unit as a whole. It took a few spins for me to realize that because a dedicated A7X fan is immediately thrown off when a song starts off aggressive as all he1l, but M. Shadows just sings through the whole thing. But once you fall into the flow of the album it's hard to not enjoy what they've done here, my fears of them \\"selling out\\" (because they're now on WB records) were all put to rest, one can sleep good knowing that: \\"Hey, at least there's still Avenged Sevenfold!\\" As for the screaming being gone, they throw it in as a background effect, just check out the intro to \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" and listen closely. Arrangements and melodies all flow nicely with the mood and atmosphere they're trying to convey with \\"City of Evil\\" and they succeed in keeping the listener completely hooked through every chord and every gallop of the double bass. This is just a \\"phase\\" in the ever evolving monster that is A7X; expect greater things to come as more albums become unleashed, TRUE fans will find this album more than fitting as a follow-up to \\"Waking the Fallen\\" (which has \\"S.t.S.T.\\" purists also complaining if I remember correctly). A7X really are proven masters of their craft, anyone who complains about this album or the choices made by A7X were obviously the \\"dead-weight\\" that was hoped to be cut off through this album; those who (are) were just into the \\"fad\\" of Metalcore bands need just turn away, those who own and hold a copy of the 99' Demo to their hearts and proudly display A7X tattoos will be proud of \\"The City of Evil\\".
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Stanley Kubrick may be my least favorite director.  I don't enjoy his work.  This, in fact, is my favorite Kubrick movie of the four I've seen.  A Clockwork Orange, 2001 Space Odyssey, and Eyes Wide Shut all disappointed me, and I couldn't stand any of them.  Some people \\"get\\" Kubrick and some don't.  I don't.  I find him ponderous and pointless.<br /><br />Even so, I think Barry Lyndon is more watchable than the other three.  The story is well told, and despite its unmanageable three hour duration, it rarely drags.<br /><br />One odd thing about this movie is that there is no one to cheer on.  Not one of the characters is likeable.  When misfortunes happen to the hero, Mr Barry, it's fine with me.  He was a jerk from the start.  He never was portrayed so viciously as to be an actual villain, but he doesn't win much sympathy from me.<br /><br />His biological son is annoying.  His stepson is annoying.  His rich wife is annoying.  His friends are annoying.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is paced so slowly that it is more than just surrealistically slow - it is stupidly slow, and the acting by Tom Cruise suffers accordingly, making him look completely inept.  The slow pace is obviously Kubrick's fault.<br /><br />The pace in Barry Lyndon is also slow, but you might call it measured.  It isn't nearly as intolerable as that horrible movie Eyes Wide Shut.  Perhaps it is because Kubrick went off the deep end near the end of his career, overrating his own ability as a director, thinking he could do no wrong when in fact he was creating a film that was embarrassingly awful and made his actors look like morons.<br /><br />In 1975 Kubrick hadn't gone quite so far off the deep end, and what we have here is a movie with a lot of strong points, able to sustain our interest, more or less, for three hours, a story well told, with some very interesting scenes.  I can almost give it a thumbs up.  The 3 star rating shows my indecision on whether or not to recommend this very long flick.<br /><br />There are some picturesque battle scenes from the Seven Years War, featuring the British, French, and Prussian armies.  Most of our time is spent with the upper crust of Europe, a tiresome bunch to begin with.  My God, they were almost as rich as baseball players!ong flick. <br /> <br />There are some picturesque battle scenes from the Seven Years War, featuring the British, French, and Prussian armies.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|My iTunes likes it just fine, imported as 192k MP3.   <br /> <br />And no, I don't share my music (except in iTunes sharing for others at work). I should have the right to make copies of my music (for instance leave the CD in my car, and listen to my MP3's at home on the iPOD or at work on my PC).  I shouldn't need three copies of the album to accomplish this. <br /> <br />As soon as you show me a starving music exectuve, I'll change my mind.  I'm not trying to *STEAL* anything.  I just want to listen to the music I PAID FOR where I want to.  The people who are going to steal it, know the way around this anyway! <br /> <br />Also, as a side note, why worried about the MP3's when I can make full rippable copies of the DVD side no problem?! At the very least I can listen to the DVD version at home, and leave the CD in my car.  But, I'll be leary to buy any more \\"COPY PROTECTED\\" CD's again from the Music Mafia.
0425129616|2.0|I hate to say anything disrespectful about the greatest mystery writer of all time, but to be quite honest, I found this book as somewhat of a let down. The first two I read, Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, absolutely blew me a way. The mysterious affair at styles was nothing less than frustrating to read. All of the characters seem tainted and by the end of the novel, I didn't care who killed her as long as he/she suffered greatly. The plot was heavy and slow and the case was not only unsolvable from a reader's stand point, but a bit lagging and dull. I hate to be so cruel, but that's my honest opinion! I am glad that so many others have such nice things to say about the book!
B0000C2IXO|5.0|In 2000, director McG had given us CHARLIE'S ANGELS, the movie, where Charlie had recruited his third batch of Angels. Well, in the summer of 2003, Charlie's Angels are back for another round of kick-a** action. <br /> <br />    NATALIE COOK (again played by Cameron Diaz), DYLAN SAUNDERS (again played by Drew Barrymore), and ALEX MUNDAY (again played by Lucy Liu) have moved on from their first assignment and have been settling on new ones. Their newest assignment is to retrieve the HALO rings. They were stolen by someone unknown to them. BOSLEY is back with the angels, but apparently, JOHN BOSELY has left the agency. He was replaced by his stepbrother, JIMMY BOSLEY (played by Bernie Mac). CHARLIE (again played by the voice of John Forsythe) is back to give the angels their assignment. <br /> <br />      They track their clues down to a drag racing track, where one of the racers seems to be a suspect. In the race is 15-year-old MAX (played by Shia LaBeouf). The suspect tries to kill Max, but some unknown drag race kills the suspect. The unknown racer that killed the angels' suspect is...CREEPY THIN MAN (again played by Crispin Glover). Seems he survived the explosion in the first film. At that moment of meeting Max, their computer brings up a file on a woman named Helen Zaas. Helen Zaas turns out to be...Dylan.  <br /> <br />     Helen Zaas was Dylan's real name before she went into the Witness Protection Program eight years earlier. She was dating a guy named Seamus O'Grady, who is one of the crooks involved in the theft of the Halo Rings. She witnessed O'Grady kill somebody, forcing Dylan to put him away. O'Grady even killed Max's parents. Max had been in an orphanage. The angels realize that Thin Man had gone to the same orphanage a long while back. The angels head out there, while Bosely takes Max to his house under protection. <br /> <br />     They receive information on Thin Man and head out on their way. They find their way to a huge garage-like storage facility, where they find the Halo Rings. But they are interrupted by...O'Grady and his gang. They battle it out, where O'Grady, to Dylan, threatens to kill her mates. <br /> <br />      That night, while Alex talks with her father, MR. MUNDAY (played by John Cleese), and her boyfriend, JASON GIBBONS (again played Matt LeBlanc), who is filming MAXIMUM EXTREME 2, the sequel to his first film and who is on a break with Alex, while Natalie and PETE (again played by Luke Wilson, who has just moved in with Natalie, attend Pete's high school reunion, Dylan leaves the agency, for she does not want her two best friends getting hurt. <br /> <br />     Natalie and Alex try going on without her. They have gotten back the two Halo Rings and handed them both to RAY CARTER (played by Robert Patrick), who had been injured and rescued by the angels on their previous assignment. His injury resulted in a few fractured ribs, but the way he caught his car keys from Bosely indicated that he faked the injury, leading Alex and Natalie to find out that he had been working with the mystery person who wanted the rings. The mystery person kills Carter. That mystery person turns out to be...MADISON LEE (played by Demi Moore). Madison had been an Angel before Natalie, Alex, and Dylan. For some reason, she has gone bad. <br /> <br />     Dylan, after receiving advice and wisdom from KELLY GARRETT (played by Jaclyn Smith), one of Charlie's first-ever angels, returns to battle Madison. She shoots the angels off the roof and goes out on her way. But the Angels survived the shootings. That night, while Jason arrives at his premier for MAXIMUM EXTREME 2, the angels battle Madison Lee. After a brief and painful a**-kicking, the angels send Madison, a former angel, into Hell. <br /> <br />     The first film was jam packed with great a**-kicking shots and special effects, but CHARLIE'S ANGLESl: FULL THROTTLE was even better than the first and you'll love it after you watch it.
B00063MBU8|3.0|I see alot of stupid metalheads and music snobs coming on here and writing negative reviews. The metalheads recommend stuff like Slayer, Metallica and Iron Maiden. The music snobs recommend Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Sonic Youth and all their \\"intelligent\\" music. I'm not bashing any of the above mentioned bands, but people- WAKE UP! Of course Simple Plan doesnt sound like the above bands. Simple Plan are a power-pop/punk band. NOT a thrash metal band, NOT a prog rock band, and NOT a post-punk/indie rock band. <br /> <br />That being said, I think this album is decent. Of course, SP tried to put a tint of emo into their music, as most pop-punk bands did in 2004-2005 (they had to at least try to survive with the trends, and besides- their labels probably didn't give them a choice. Look at Good Charlotte, Relient K, Mest, etc. They all went a little emo). The lyrics of course are the weak point, just as the last SP album. But I personally prefer the first SP album over this one because it was more of a party/summer/fun record and this one tries to be more \\"deep\\". Best tracks are \\"Thank You\\", \\"Me Against The World\\", \\"Promise\\" and \\"Untitled\\". None of the tracks are really horrible, their all listenable.  <br /> <br />Peace.

1573223026|4.0|I never read a Nick Hornby book before, and I was not prepared for the sharp satirical eye and keen observational skills he adroitly displays here. The title of his novel refers to a suicide jump from the roof of a building known as Topper's House, where four characters, three English and one American, come on New Year's Eve to commit suicide. They attempt to talk one another out of the fateful deed, but the lingering threat of suicide haunts their tenuous friendship throughout the story, as voiced by the alternating voices of the four disparate narrators. Predictably the plot focuses on the characters bonding and discovering, through connections with each other, reasons to go on living. The concept sounds trivial, almost like a fable, but the execution is quite plausible, sensitive and sometimes quite amusing thanks to Hornby's quicksilver writing style and consequently allows each character his or her fair share of humanity and humor.<br /><br />The four sound a bit like stereotypes in a mid-1970's disaster movie. Maureen is a meek, sanctimonious woman whose life has been devoted to caring for her profoundly disabled adult son, comatose since birth. She wants to jump off the building holding a copy of Richard Yates' novel \\"Revolutionary Road\\" as a means to boost sales for the author. Perhaps to enhance the melodramatic possibilities of his premise, Hornby has painted the remaining three as semi-famous celebrities at the beginning of the story. Martin is a familiar TV talk show host and tabloid columnist until an affair with a fifteen-year-old girl obliterates his career and family. He has been reduced to interviewing nobodies on an obscure cable-access channel, FeetUp!TV. JJ is a young American musician so rocked by the rapid collapse of his band and his love life that he resorts to delivering pizzas for a living. Foul-mouthed and drug-abusing Jess is the unstable daughter of a young politician, whose big sister has disappeared and may be dead.<br /><br />All four seem like soloists learning to become an ensemble who get past a lot of prejudices and not without incident, like flawed singers trading dissonant but heartfelt solos. Unsurprisingly, they all wind up some place quite different at the end of the book from where they expected. They eventually reunite even attempting a group intervention at a Starbucks when things go south for their burgeoning friendship. Such is Hornby's dry sense of humor. Despite the rich comedy, there is uneasiness in the subject matter. While Hornby's sensibility is perfectly matched to the quirkier elements here, he seems less comfortable with the subject of suicide itself. He generally opts for the comedy than dealing with the darker elements, and the novel simply tapers off in a pat manner with hints of reluctant affirmation among the characters. Hornby makes me care about these four failed suicides because he realistically illustrates how their lives improved almost imperceptibly. It's a subtle growth that signals a major writing talent.ists learning to become an ensemble who get past a lot of prejudices and not without incident, like flawed singers trading dissonant but heartfelt solos.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I am a a7x fanatic, and i love this new album. The standout songs like: M.I.A, sidewinder, bat country and strength of the world, are fantastic and i strongly urge anyone who likes punk/hardcore music like me will love this album. Although i would have to say that the lack of heaviness, that was seen on a7x's Waking the fallen, is slightly dissapointing, and the softer vocals can irritate at times. Any guitarists who like shredding would like this album, and any drummers, like me, will admire the playing on this album. <br />But overall this is an amazing achievement and a great album.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I have an eMac computer and it does work for me.  It is a pretty good cd, however I haven't really gotten into the second disk....yet
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First let me say that this is the first album I've ever felt I need to leave a review for. I came across this group and album by sheer luck and I can't pass a day without listening to it. The album just kicks some serious arse.<br /><br />However, as been noted in previous comments, there are tracks that just wonder off in some funky loop that feels like it will never end. Like the last 3 minutes of \\"Cygnus\\". The last 2 1/2 minutes of \\"Widow\\". The first 3 1/2 minutes of \\"Miranda\\". The last minute of \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\". What is that about? Perhaps I don't get the trippiness of it all. In anycase, I can't be far away from my player controls because I need to run back and skip those sections.<br /><br />But even with those approx 10 minutes of \\"wuh?\\", the tracks just kick  it. I'm going back now to buy some of their older stuff.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I finally replaced my original 1989 copy of this, purchased the week it was released. My original copy is *very* well-played. Now I wonder why I waited so long to get this remastered edition. Probably because it's one of those albums that might sit for a year gathering dust in the CD rack (it's comforting just to know it's there) but I always come back to it and remember why it's one of my all-time favourites. And it always will be, right up there with Talk Talk's \\"Colour Of Spring.\\" The songs are things of beauty. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, I didn't love the album at first, didn't even really *like* it, but I held onto it. And a few listens later, I couldn't stop playing it. It's such a rare thing and I envy anyone with the opportunity to experience it for a first time.  <br /> <br />Also, refreshingly, the bonus tracks are great.
B0008KLVG4|2.0|Alright, if you've never got around to adding Jaws to your dvd collection then now is as good a time as any with this edition. But if you shelled out for the \\"25th Anniversary\\" disc, then STAY AWAY from this scam. It comes with the unabridged documentary that was found on laser. But does it have a commentary track? Are you kidding? What else is Universal and $pielberg going to lure you into buying this again when its released on HDVD? These people didn't even see fit to remaster the print with the latest digital technology. This is a shameful, worthless edition. Univeral / $pielberg deserve nothing less than your enmity and contempt for failing dvddom AGAIN.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This is her fourth album but instead of getting better shes getting worse. Of course their are some songs that are great like all the singles of this album (Me Against the Music, Toxic, Everytime and Outrageous) but comparing to the old Britney, she was better before, now she does not even sing like she used to. It is a good album but not her best.
B000059MEK|5.0|Discovery is better than homework and human after all. It is one of my all time favorite albums. <br /> <br />1. One More Time - 10/10 - Great song. Its a classic. <br />2. Aerodynamic  - 10/10 - One of my favorite daft punk songs. Very good. <br />3. Digital Love  - 10/10 - Another amazing song. <br />4. Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - 10/10 - Best song the the album, and probably my favorite daft punk songs.  <br />5. Crescendolls - 2/10 - A pretty annoying song. <br />6. Night Vision - 9/10 - Short and peaceful song. <br />7. Superheroes - 9/10 - Repetitive, but good. <br />8. High Life - 8/10 - Repetitive, but good.  <br />9. Something About Us - 7/10 - Slow paced song. <br />10. Voyager - 10/10 - Great song. <br />11. Veridis Quo - 6/10 - Its alright. <br />12. Short Circuit - 9/10 - Nice song. <br />13. Face To Face - 10/10 - VERY good song. Single worthly. <br />14. Too Long - 8/10 - Decent song. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is definitely Coldplay's most ambitions and significant bid for the U2 crown. Instead of bashing them, perhaps we should be thanking them for rising to the occasion. Afterall, no one else has been bold enough or brave enough to make an album that could even challenge. Somebody had to eventually. That's the only way the cycle of great music continues. So Coldplay does establish themselves as a contemporary with \\"X&Y.\\" But I never would have mistaken anything off the album as U2. In my opinion, they both sound different. They overlap in some areas, but where they diverge is evident. I can immediately recognize Chris Martin's piano and voice soaring over the heady arrangements and melodies. With songs like \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist,\\" Coldplay did define their own type of song and sound and continue to with songs like \\"What If\\" and \\"Square One.\\" One reason why this album invites comparisons is because Coldplay's sound got bigger on this CD and I think that gets associated more with U2. But I think it's just more of a bigger, more theatrical, more assured Coldplay. The album will undoubtedly invite endless analogies. But when I put on my headphones and turn on the CD, there's no question that I'm listening to Coldplay. But to just completely dismiss them as a rip-off is unfair. Right, there will never be another U2, but that doesn't mean that there won't be another GREAT band. Because Coldplay is proof that another great band does exist. \\"X&Y\\" is evidence that Coldplay is at least worthy of a comparison, worthy of being put on the same platform. They've at least gotten that far. For most bands, the journey will end before now. So the fact that Coldplay has made it this far shouldn't be overlooked. It shouldn't be taken lightly. They've been elevated to this status for a reason. People giving this CD 1, 2, or 3 stars are nuts. Those saying that \\"X&Y\\" doesn't match AROBTTH aren't even listening to the same record that I am. \\"X&Y\\" is better by any means. This CD shows promising growth and development. People should open their mind and give Coldplay a chance. You might be surprised.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|This album is ok. It is the worst daft punk album, but its still not bad. My favorite tracks are Human after all, robot rock, make love, the brainwasher and television rules the nation. I love daft punk the the rest of the tracks are bad.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana is known by most as a revolutionary band which changed the music scene single handedly with their monster major-label debut \\"Nevermind\\" on David Geffen. I had just finished my Mormon mission when these guys came out, and I can remember nothing but madness coming from Cobain's mouth. <br /> <br />With dire interest into Cobain's life, I picked up a book about him. I was shocked and horrified at what he thought his life was like. He was a political aristocrat? A feminist? A God-hating fool with no direction? Stunned at what I had read, I felt compelled to write something about these guys. <br /> <br />Feminism and related God-hating practices are not the way to go about life. Family Values and Righteous Church-going is what keeps today's society alive, not crazy Liberal messages of hate and disgust. On top of all this, he committed suicide on April 5 of 1994, as most Nirvana fans recall. This is how to go to hell the quickest, commit suicide.  <br /> <br />To help prevent this, I suggest you attend the church of latter-day saints to help you get a grip on life and find out more about God and his plans for you. <br /> <br />P.S. In no way am I affiliated with \\"Prophet Gordon\\". I assume this man is a fake and trying to give the Mormon church a bad name. I wrote this review in hopes that you will change your mind about Mormons and that we are not a bunch of abusive weirdos.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|I didn't find Bridget THAT cute in this story after seeing her with That strange make up in her face for that party. It was not fun, made her seems very unworthy of Mark Darcy. Both the guys were stupendous, the cad one suggesting a \\"shag-a-thon\\" weekend, the fight in the fountain, really nice, they \\"saved\\"the movie. But Bridget with that make-up, the party, being in that prison where the roomates were so cultured that most of them knew English, Mars and Venus, Madonna sounds crap. The movie had too many flaws, the only thing worthy was seeing both guys fighting for her (Why anyway? She is a pathetic woman).
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I don't like to compare an artist's old albums to new ones; I just try to judge each piece on their own merit. After hearing Cigaro and BYOB, I was excited to get my hands on this album. After a couple of listens, though there were some gems, this album just didn't move me. Stand out tracks include the two already stated, Sad Statue and Revenga. I would have given this a 2 star rating, but I like the four songs so much I had to give it a three. Other than these songs though, I'm just not impressed.
0553260588|5.0|Hiroshima is the factual although perhaps not graphic enough account of six survivors of the first atomic bomb blast in World War II.  Having read a number of books on the subject, I can say this is among the best. <br /> <br />Hiroshima begins with a synopsis of the events of August 6, 1945.  In a short explanation, it details what each of the survivors was doing the moment the bomb was dropped.  The remaining chapters discuss the aftereffects of the bomb.  Even the stigma of being a Hiroshima survivor limited what a person could do in life.  This does not even account for the divergent health ailments that linger after a nuclear attack.  The last chapter goes into depth about the life of each of the six survivors.  What I found most interesting is that five of the six focused much of the remainder of their lives in religion.  Having each survived many years after the bomb, these people are a testament to the power of religious faith. <br /> <br />While the book is short, it gives readers a human perspective of the effects of the atomic bomb.  The reader can not help but feel empathy for those civilians who became victims for life because of a war for which they had no personal stake.
B0000009RT|4.0|This was and is my first Zappa album, so I can't compare it to any of his other work. But so many other people have, so it's not really going to matter. <br />It's amazing how diverse this album is. The styles range from doo wop/50's rock to blues to left-of-center pop to R&B to avant-garde to EVERYTHING! and it is just amazing how one band could pull that off. <br />Being an experimental-rock and avant-garde fanatic, it's no surprise that my two favorites are \\"Help, I'm a Rock\\" and \\"The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\", but I also like \\"How Could I Be Such A Fool,\\" \\"Trouble Every Day,\\" \\"Who are the Brain Police?\\" and \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\\". The rest of the album, to me, is good but not great.  <br />So there's my point of view on a very good album. If you haven't bought it yet, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU?
B0006L16N8|2.0|I guess this is what they mean by adult alternative rock. Although I will never understand why music which can sell 20 million albums can be anything but mainstream.  <br />I kinda liked \\"Yellow\\" but found the rest of Parachutes a little too twee and precious. Now, Rush of Blood to the Head, I hated initially but it grew on me and how! The influence of Echo & the Bunnymen was strong and I loved the psychedelic nuances and wasn't \\"The Scientist\\" simply gorgeous? <br />Which brings us to X&Y and COldplay is suddenly carrying EMI on its back... the new Beatles, wow!  <br />Overall, X&Y lacks the conviction of Rush of Blood, with Martin and co repeating the formula a little too often for comfort. Do we need a fifth remake of \\"The Scientist\\"? And how do you take the moaning of a rock millionaire seriously anyway? Cobain notwithstanding. <br />So I giving this the thumbs down, it leaves me cold. Ask me at the end of the year, and it'll be in my top albums of 2005. Probably.  <br />
B0009353IW|5.0|It's not just that Ry Cooder has been producing albums for more than 35 years -- many of them solidly thematic, like the 1971 \\"Into the Purple Valley.\\" He's more than a terrific guitarist (slide, originally, but now almost anything within the guitar world, and including, now, at least a dozen other instruments). He's done fine film soundtracks, some of his most sonorous work, and some earnest vocals, which he's better at than John Fahey or Leo Kottke and various other virtuoso guitarists, and he's improving still more. And he's a genius in popularizing and producing other sounds, which we all know of, and attained a degree of controversy with the *Buena Vista* albums and his assistance lent to an ascendancy of Caribbean, and especially Cuban, music.<br /><br />But why buy THIS album? How about 'cause it's stone-cold brilliant, capturing the late 1940s and 50s when the polyglot but predominantly Hispanic neighborhood at Ch&aacute;vez Ravine was displaced to allow what would become \\"Dodger Stadium\\" and orderly rows of suburban housing to replace the slightly hectic disorder previously there. But understand that this isn't a rabble-rousing album, or a call to arms; it's a reminder of what's gone by, hearkening to Don Normark's photographic study (also called *Chavez Ravine*, 1999), and it recognizes the fanatically purposeful energy that channelized and paved the L.A. River (see Blake Gumprecht's *L.A. River*, now in paperback). I'll take this musical treatment (with plenty of voices in it, though, and an astounding variety of themes) over the blunt muckraking of a Mike Davis anyday -- this is inspired stuff, in a huge assortment of styles, bringing in a number of the musical lights of Ch&aacute;vez Ravine in the era. They're mixed together, elegantly, and very nicely produced.<br /><br />Favorites? The album's a mix of contemporary songs and current-day compositions by Cooder. But I'm a big time fan, on ninth or ten listening, of \\"Poor Man's Shangri-la,\\" \\"Onda Callejera,\\" \\"El U.F.O.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|It is extremely frustrating to see people complain about the copy protection and completely ignore the music.  One star reviews give the impression that the music is sub par and that just is not the case with this cd. <br /> <br />Disc one has a heavier edge to it and is typical foo fighters work.  It is straightforward rock with excellent guitar riffs and growling vocals from Dave Grohl.  The only complaint is that it does feel a bit monontonous after a while, but it still works.  Standout tracks from disc one include:  No Way Back, Best of You, Resolve, and Deepest Blues are Black. <br /> <br />Disc two is acoustic work and has a much softer sound.  To me, this disc is the highlight of the two and contains some of the Foo Fighter's best work to date.  Songs like \\"Over and Out\\" and \\"What if I do?\\" are incredible.  \\"Razor\\" really highlights the vocal range that Dave Grohl possesses but doesn't always show.  Even Norah Jones makes and appearance on \\"Virginia Moon\\" and harmonizes really well with Grohl's voice. <br /> <br />This cd is well deserving of at least 4 stars and should not be reviewed based on the copy protection that has been put on the cd.  It should instead be reviewed based on the quality of the music and for that reason should not receive another one star review.
0060090367|3.0|I picked this book up to read on vacation.  It was fun, but the writing style tended to get on my nerves at times.  A lot of one line writing that seemed to go on and on, driving the joke beyond the point of funniness.  Also, the ending dragged on a bit too much and was far too predictable.  All in all though, an easy, light read with some very funny moments.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Where do I begin?  This album works as foo music. Although on this album the foos aren't sure whether to emulate  <br />'Motorhead' or 'Dashboard Confessional'.  <br /> <br />At any rate, your listening to the diminishing quality of a great 1990s band. An attempt at being both commercial and relevant in 2005. Essentially, this is a take off on an OLD idea for a posthumous nirvana record with acoustic on one disc (MTV unplugged) and live electric on another disc(Wishkah).  These issues wouldn't be a problem if the foo fighters still approached thier music with the creativity of thier early releases. The fact is- the foos aren't putting out classic music anymore.  <br /> <br /> <br /> *However*,this double disc raises some uncomfortable issues about this foo fighters' outing: <br /> <br />1. Is the first disc your answer to hardrock? I can't believe they let Grohl in Queens of The Stone Age, much less Nirvana! <br />the music on the first disc is a very watered down hard rock pabulum, it achieves no harder sound than the previous albums. The music on the first disc is rock-ish, but does not work as HARDrock.  <br /> <br />2. Cut the gimmick promotions and start focusing on consistently solid music. The second acoustic disc was a start. However, for Grohl to compare this disc to LedZep's \\"Physical Graphitti\\" is frankly absurd. If somone asked me to recommend a Foo Fighters Disc to listen to I'd say any of the 1990s discs. If somone asked which foo album to buy to buy it would be \\"Foo Fighters\\" or \\"The Color and the Shape.\\" Which means that Grohl needs to start looking at the declining quality of the foomusic. I suppose the \\"accoustic=sincerity\\" equation that Nirvana brought back to the mainstream can work for the Foos. However, the second disc seems like a shallow attempt at relevance for the Emo crowd dollar.  <br /> <br />3. I've notice this band loves copy-protection on thier music, Maybe, RCA is to blame and maybe not...the endless plethora of foo bsides and the DVD versions and Copy-protected store versions ARE A HEADACHE for legitimate consumers whom have IPODs. <br />The purported \\"making-of\\" -behind the scenes footage- included on special versions of HONOR, feels like a sales pitch and not a candid look at the band. Could 'Honor' be just another excuse to release some more collectables and not a THE definitive FOO ALBUM? <br /> <br />4. Electric Light Orchestra appears on 'Cold Day in the Sun'...ah, I'm sorry I mean Taylor Hawkins sings on 'Cold Day in the Sun'. His voice sounds Jeff Lyne from the classic rock band ELO, so much so I expected him start singing 'Evil Woman.' 'Coattail Riders' is the name of Hawkins sideproject band that he trumpets in interviews, *indeed Mr. Hawkins*. <br /> <br />5.There are better albums out there, even by Grohl. This isn't the FOO album that will make anyones TOP100 albums list..that reward goes to either thier first or second album, not 'Honor.' <br /> <br />In summary: It's difficult to be authentic when it's- another day, another dollar for the foos.
B000002MG1|5.0|REM's \\"Automatic For the People\\" was not only the last great album by the band but also the best recording of the band's career.  That is quite an achievement for a band that has had several great moments. Starting with the leadoff track \\"Drive\\" every track is at least good and several of the songs are classic.  While this recording is a little more melancholy than their other output, it still carries several trademarks of the classic REM sound.  And the last two tracks, which have never received any airplay are two of the most beautiful compositions they have ever recorded.  It is really sad that REM deviated towards a grunge sound on their next recording and they have never seemed to regain their magic touch since.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I love Coldplay but I must say I'm extremely disappointed.  I think the expectations were that the guys just couldn't go wrong with this album -- after all, their first two were so amazingly great.  Unfortunately, X & Y is barely mediocre and just downright boring.  There are only two standouts of the 13 songs: \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Square One.\\"  The rest just seem to blend into one another, creating a sort of a drone.  Thankfully I don't think I'll ever tire of their first two albums, and I've already replaced X & Y in my car CD changer with Rush of Blood.  Now THAT'S good Coldplay.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|This album is progressively worst then TOT with the last 3 releases being progressively worse then the first 4,not that WDADU was bad.  I believe most people like myself are dedicated Dream Theater fans because of Images and Words and Awake.  After hearing these albums I was hooked - probably for life. The musicianship, the song structures, the dreamy lyrics, the time changes, the feelings these two cd's give you that never gets old. YES, that is way I love Dream Theater.  I miss what Kevin Moore added to the band.  He added a lot more feeling then Derek or Jordon.  I am very tired of hearing Jordon's tones and quick unmelodic solo's.  All the things that made me love this band have declined not progressed.<br /><br />  This band was something very special but they are throwing it away.  They need to:<br /><br />1. Stop all the side projects<br />2. Take some time and slowly write the songs instead of putting everything together 2 months in the studio.<br />3. Say goodbye to Jordon Rudess<br />4. Reunite with Kevin Moore - THIS WAS DREAM THEATER<br /><br />I am having a hard time understanding how people can give this album a high rating.  I think these people should go back and listen to IaW,Awake,ACOS,SFAM. and then review this album. And for you, the reader of this review, you should pick up these albums instead. These are the albums that define Dream Theater.

B0006L16N8|2.0|Its \\"Ehh.\\" <br /> <br />Production-wise, most of the songs sound the same with epic and predictable song structures with giant guitars clashing against them all, with the exception of the simple hidden track. That track is as fun as a pile of Borax. <br /> <br />A majority of the songs on 'X&Y' are good, but nothing more. 'Square One' 'White Shadows' and 'Talk' are nice, but still won't stick after a dozen listens. Some, such as 'What If' and 'A Message' start off wonderfully, mainly due to the fact that 500 lbs of guitar and synth organ aren't coming at full speed. However, these songs are quickly ruined by the resurrection of the album's production values, and they lose everything they had going for them. <br /> <br />The best (and only) song that begins close to clinching some musical booty is 'Speed of Sound'. Then you realize its just 'Clocks' reflected in a mirror and turned upside down, and you realize you should listen to the first-born instead. <br /> <br />However, its the lyrics that truly kill any desire to hear this album anytime soon. While Coldplay has never been known for its lyrical swooning, they've gotten their point across with many unique and personal poems. With 'X&Y', they've taken a giant step backwards into the cliched and silly. Its not just some of the tunes, its all of them. 'Swallowed by the Sea', 'A Message', and 'Fix You' know how to take us back to having a high school poetry notebook, 'Swallowed...' especially. <br /> <br />Also, the last five tracks are a mish mash of sound that go on for too long. 'Twisted Logic' doesn't really do anything, and its hard to conjure up anything worth remembering about 'Low' and 'The Hardest Part'. <br /> <br />'X&Y' will not improve your musical life, and you won't be missing out by skipping it.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Let's see... <br />First of all, the album covers intrigued me with its black background and some strange arrangement of grey & colorful squares. <br />Then I bumped into an article explaining that the squares are actually some kind of digital code representation for the album title \\"X & Y\\"; and I was thinking, isn't this brilliant or what? <br /> <br />Secondly, after listening the album for a number of runs, I think this album is more solid than its predecessors. The numerous layers of sound have been arranged nicely to get powerful effect. <br />And it sounds a bit different as well - yet still familiar Coldplay-sound - due to higher singing pitch chosen by the frontmant Chris for almost all of the songs (except perhaps, the hidden track). <br /> <br />Out of this solid album, obviously there are some gems, including 'Fix You', 'A Message' & 'Square One'; but my favourite so far is the 'Twisted Logic', a powerful number. <br /> <br />BTW, if you happen to read NYT criticism, you'll notice that the author is almost in full praise of the album (in disguise); but unfortunately he just cannot stand Chris' voice. To me then, the significance of his criticism just plunges because it's become merely some kind of personal dislike.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have read other reviewers here on Amazon and I simply have to agree with the fact that you can hear thirty years of musical influence in this album.  X&Y is a blend of about 60% U2, 15% The Fixx, 10% Pink Floyd, 5% The Beatles, and 10% other past influences.  It might be a surprise to other reviewers that one of the first songs I liked is the ninth song on the album called \\"Low\\" which sustains a beat reminiscent of U2's \\"New Years Day\\".  I also like the first song on the album which is powerful and addictive tune called \\"Square One\\" that starts out somewhat like the beginning of the famous \\"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\" song \\"Relax\\" and then quickly evolves into another U2 type of melody. The second song is a simple but pleasant Beatles or Elton John type of knock off called \\"What If\\".  The third song  \\"White Shadows\\" picks up the heavy beat and faster pace where \\"Square One's \\" theme left off. The next song \\"Fix You\\" departs dramatically from the pace of the first three as does the next song \\"Talk\\" which takes you to a place you did not expect to go in a way that reminds me more of Pink Floyd's earlier works. Track seven \\"Speed of Sound\\" returns to a familiar acoustic piano \\"Clocks\\" type of theme from Coldplay's previous record. As the X&Y album progresses and the songs begin to play themselves out they pleasantly bring back memories of many classic rock groups of the past but in a unique and strange new way. Where the genius  exists in X&Y like all well made rock albums is that as you listen to the complete album more and more it really begins to grow on you. Some songs will catch you right away while others develop in the context of the entire flow of the album.    I have been listening to rock music since I was a very young kid when my first favorite rock albums were the vinyl recordings of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" (Welcome Back My Friends... To The Show That Never Ends!) and of course Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\". After hearing hundreds of albums and thousands of songs in the past thirty plus years I know a good album when I hear it.  For anyone who has never heard of Coldplay or for current fans of the group I can definitely recommend this album. I find most songs on this album to be very well done and some songs to be extraordinary. If there is to be any criticism of this album it would be the often lack of depth in the lyrics compared to many of the great classic rock albums. Many seasoned rock fans might also conclude that many of the songs on X&Y lack the cutting edge melodic originality that was first revealed on many of those great albums of the past. This statement may be partially true but this no way detracts from the pure sonic enjoyment of this album's listening experience. I do not own Coldplay's first major full length album (Parachutes) but I do own their second effort (A Rush of Blood to the Head). I do not want to disagree with other fans of the group but I do feel that X&Y is much better album. For the sake of fairness and to put it all in a proper perspective Coldplay's overall effort on X&Y simply blows away most of the more recent popular rock albums I have heard. What Coldplay accomplishes with this latest release is to borrow from past musical themes while maintaining their own more modern sound style that we have come to undeniably recognize from recent hits such as \\"Clocks\\" as being \\"Coldplay\\". In conclusion I believe that most people will enjoy this album \\"X&Y\\" very much. Welcome Back My Friends to The First New Big Rock Supergroup of This Century!
B000005DQR|5.0|Years ago I was looking for new underground hiphop.  I came with Blackalicious and loved it.  Following the path of Quannum I heard \\"Midnight In A Perfect World\\".  I heard something new in hiphop that I had never heard before.  Not the same trash hiphop that sells out.  I decided to get this album.  Electronic and hiphop blended perfectly. This album changed my life, I started discovering new artists with different, experimental music that blew up my mind.  Now i am open to any kind of GOOD music, intelligent, well done music.  That is why this album is a classic, that is why I love it, it changed my perception of music completely.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you are a rock fan, especially a fan of Tool or similar bands, give this a listen, you know that Maynard doesn't disappoint.  It has some truly excellent songs, really all of them (except of course the one where they just count to 8.)  All of the songs fit together brilliantly. Listening to this album, much like Tool's Lateralus is an experience of its own...it somehow goes beyond just listening to a CD, and leaves you with your spine tingling and your hair standing on end.  This is a very solid album, and I recommend it.
B00000JCOV|3.0|Yes, I know I wrote a review for this before (I had to delete it just to get this one in), praising it and giving it five stars. But five years later and many albums later, once again, just like Iowa before it, I just don't see what the big fuss was over in ninth grade. <br /> <br />Is this album absymal? No. Far from it. However, it is also far from brilliance. This album DOES have two songs I still occasionally listen to: \\"Eyeless\\" and \\"Wait And Bleed\\", which still sound kinda cool to me. That's one advantage it has over Iowa: Iowa is just sitting, collecting dust. This one, thanks to those two songs, gets the occasional spin. (\\"Spit It Out\\" and \\"(sic)\\" are still decent, as well). The rest of the songs, however, are just, meh. <br /> <br />Anyway, yeah. This is an average album. A few good songs, but overall, these days, it just sounds kinda lackluster, unlike five years ago when I heralded this as the coolest album I ever heard. <br /> <br />I will give Slipknot (the band) this, though: \\"Before I Forget\\" is a really good song.
B00097DX3U|5.0|One of the few CDs recently released that is truly excellent...some people are giving it bad reviews because the band is maturing...they have softened their edge a bit, but the music is just as good, maybe better.  Cornell's vocals are smoother on this album than in the past, and the distortion was tuned down a bit over their debut...but the vocals are still great, the guitar still rocks, and just like RATM used to do it, even the drums and bass are amazing.  Audioslave has not made the mistake that so many other bands made of refusing to mature, a band has to be who they are right then, not who they used to be, but they stayed true to their roots and delivered once again. <br />if you liked RATM, Soundgarden, or Audioslave's debut...or even if you didn't but are looking for a quality modern rock album, give this one a shot.
0064407667|5.0|The Baudelaire children (Violet, Klaus and Sunny) truly suffer a series of unfortunate events.  What a guilty pleasure to revel in their misery.  The series begins with a fire destroying their home and killing their parents.  Then things get worse.  Forced to live with the the scheming Count Olaf, it is soon apparent that the Count is only interested in the Baudelaire fortune, which he attempts to gain my marrying young Violet.<br /><br />The book is accessable to readers of all levels, as vocabulary words are introduced and defined in a non-condesending way in a story line that is riveting.  Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This album is excellent, in some ways better than Toxicity.  All of the songs have a great Melodic sound, and all have deep political messages.  The infuriating thing is it's just over a half hour long, and yet they plan to release the second half this fall.  Why not put them on one CD...is SOAD buying into the cruel cheating dishonest capitalist system, trying to squeeze a larger profit outta this?
B0008KLVG4|1.0|All the hoopla about this being a DVD that consumers must have, but it's not good enough for any cast/crew member or critic to provide commentary?  Pathetic.
1400031087|5.0|...is that it is an absolutely beautiful story with an ending so tragic and perfect at the same time that it brought me to tears.  I want to read it again and again.  And I also can't wait to pick up my copy of \\"My Friend Leonard.\\"

B00029LNHS|5.0|This was the first BEP album I got. I haven't heard their work before \\"Elephunk\\", but now I want to own every album they made. The BEPs rock and are one of the best bands out there. Their new bandmember, Fergie, raised some controversy, but I think she's a perfect addition to the group. Her vocals are awesome, so I can't imagine the BEPs without her. <br /> <br />This album is somewhat innapropriate in parts, I must admit to those who are afraid that this is more innapropriate than most albums. No. The BEPs are actually one of the cleaner bands out there. Of course, there are a few suggestive things in here, but nothing to go crazy over. And don't hate the song \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" because of it's use of the word 'retarded'. The BEPs mean no harm; they are not referring to the mentally disabled. I think it is somewhat 'retarded' that people hate that song (and the BEPs) because of this. To the sticklers, skip to track 14. <br /> <br />You'll basically want to buy this album for the singles because the other tracks are generally not as good. There are tons of singles, though, so you'll like the album <br /> <br />1. Hands Up (3:37) B <br />Cool intro song. I like the chorus (\\"Get 'em up, Get 'em up...\\"). Not the best of songs, but a great party song. <br />2. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) (4:00) B+ <br />Awesome party song! The ode to vacation is here and will make you dance. Caution: this song is infectious, so be careful if you start singing the chorus like Fergie. <br />3. Let's Get Retarded (3:35) A- <br />The original \\"Let's Get It Started\\". Would be a perfect party song if everyone wasn't so sensitive about the word 'retarded'. Again, that whole business is really 'retarded'.  <br />4. Hey Mama (3:45) A- <br />More party songs. Everyone knows this! I wish they put the single version (the one heard on the radio) on this album, but whatever, this song rocks. Some people were upset when the BEPs went from singing about stopping war to clubbing, but deal with it!! This song is awesome, even if it isn't supposed to be inspirational. <br />5. Shut Up! (4:59) A <br />Fergie shines on this awesome single. That chorus is really catchy, and the verses are also pretty infectious. You will like this song. <br />6. Smells Like Funk (5:06) A- <br />That ultimate beat is the reason to this song. The lyrics are OK, but tune that out and just listen to that infectious beat 'n' bass combo. Doesn't smell like filler to me, though. <br />7. Latin Girls (6:20) B+ <br />Long, but pretty good. That \\"Mira mira mira mira...\\" part at the beginning will hook you in the song. Pretty good stuff here, but it somewhat seems like filler. <br />8. Sexy (4:45) B <br />Jazzy BEPs! Very 'Sexy' song here, but again, somewhat like filler. <br />9. Fly Away (3:39) A- <br />Fergie shines again with her almost-solo song. That infectious chorus will keep this song on your repeat playlist. Again, Fergie proves her allegiance to the band with this great song. <br />10. The Boogie That Be (5:13) A <br />Again, another ultimately infectious beat that will hook you. That chorus is pretty good, too. 'Nuff said. <br />11. The Apl Song (2:56) A+ <br />Nearly-flawless ode to Apl.de.ap's homeland, the Phillipines. This is his song, and it turns out to be one of the best on the album. That chorus will be repeating in your head forever. Not a single, but should be because this song is AWESOME. <br />12. Anxiety -featuring Papa Roach- (3:39) B+  <br />Not very BEP-like, but a great song to listen to when your angry. That intro is innapropriate, though, so watch out if you don't want to hear any cursing. Of course, I don't care, but just noting. The fact that Papa Roach suprisingly appears on this song was really surprising to me. That chorus is great. Destructive, but great. <br />13. Where Is The Love? -featuring Justin Timberlake- (4:32) A+ <br />Where is the transition? From a song about letting out anger to stopping war is not the best transition. Anyway, to the song...THISIS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, actually one of the best songs ever. Inspirational, catchy, well-written, well-performed, the list goes on and on. Even though Justin Timberlake stars in it (and I do not like him AT ALL), this song is awesome. An instant classic. Just take one good listen and you'll realize how good this is. It's too bad though that the \\"one world\\" part was cut out of the single, because that part was just deep. LISTEN TO THE SONG. 'NUFF SAID. <br />14. Let's Get It Started (3:36) A- <br />The ultimate party song. I don't like how they had to change it, but they added some sound effects so I'm content.  <br />15. Third Eye (3:44) B <br />Worst song on the album, actually. Not really bad, but just doesn't stand out for me. OK, I guess. <br /> <br />So that's \\"Elephunk\\"! The singles rock, but the other songs mostly just fall short (with the exception of \\"Smells Like Phunk\\", \\"Boogie That Be\\" and \\"The Apl Song\\"). Definitely buy this album, though, because it includes pure classics and tons of perfect party songs. And \\"Where Is the Love?\\".  <br /> <br />Overall, this album gets an: A-.
B00019PDKC|5.0|Anathema's latest album is incredible.  The album overall is very atmospheric, and each track is done extremely well.  Every song on this album is dominated by raw emotion.  I think \\"beautiful gloom\\" is the best way to describe this album.  The musicianship on this album is also done well which consists mostly of slow guitar riffs, soft drumming, and eerie keyboards.  Only one song strays away from this and that is \\"Pulled Under At 2000 Metres A Second\\" which has some heavy distorted guitar riffs and some screaming vocals.  Each guitar, drum, keyboard etc.., arrangement is done to absolute perfection.  These arrangements, along with Vince's haunting vocals create this \\"beautiful gloom\\" which leaves one breathless in each and every track.  The most captivating songs on this album in my opinion are \\"Flying\\" in which Vince's vocals could not be any better, and \\"A Natural Disaster,\\" which includes serene, quivering vocals done by a female vocalist (Anna Livingstone).   <br /> <br />Whenever I pop this album in, I always picture walking down a damp, wet street with gray clouds encompassing the sky, a light drizzle falling and the air being very cold and crisp.  This is the perfect album to listen to after a stressful day, or if you just want to soothed.  Anathema could not have created a better album with \\"A Natural Disaster.\\"  Definitely an essential album to add to your collection.            <br /> <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Similar to Mer De Noms,the 13th ~ plays host to wonderful music. <br />Haunting melodies, Maynard's kick ass voice, skilled instrumentals and writing that isn't manipulated by corporate presses, are the most noteworthy aspects of the album. <br /> <br /> In addition to powerful tracks, that are for the most part well constructed and pleasing to the ear, the album itself has a tone. Releasing an album as a coherent form of art seems like a rare occurance these days, with bands practically using creative enema's to drop everything they can on us, in hope that they will impress us enough to give them fame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />~APC~ rocks
B00082IJ08|4.0|I have never been interested in Gorillaz because I didn't think they produced very good music and that it would be a waste of time to even try any of their C.Ds out! But i am now reconsidering as their new album has a lot of interesting and unique songs. I am enjoying the album so much that i already have four or five favourites and i haven't even finished listening to the album yet! My mum bought the album after listening to their brilliant single, 'Feel Good Inc.' She also bought the Coldplay album as she thinks they are great and record brilliant songs, but feeling that the Coldplay album was a complete disappointment, she is growing much closer to the Gorillaz, even though she is a 42 year old mother who does not like or approve of rap or would never even think about listening to the Gorillaz- but they proved me and my mum wrong! I think that this album deserves 4 stars,as their are only two or three dud songs. VERY pleased!
B00005JNJT|4.0|Don't get me wrong - this is not a negative review. I am speaking as another Bat-geek; one who has waited years for someone to get it right. Nolan & Co. gave us the most true vision we'll probably ever see. However, there is a HUGE flaw in the story. I felt this had to be shared where perhaps some of you will agree with me, some won't. In this movie, BATMAN DOESN'T KILL OR MAIM HIS VICTIMS. This is the best, darkest 'Batman' to date and Bruce Wayne IS scary as hell. But by the end of the movie, my fear of him deminished, as did everyone else's in the theater. This is due to the fact that Batman beats up all his criminals and leaves them to be found by police. The movie reveals that most cops are crooked in Gotham, as are high standing judicial and political figures. So why would a criminal fear The Bat if they're just knocked out, and then released from jail a few days later? That dilemma really undermines Wayne's effectiveness and ultimate goal: to strike fear and erradicate the criminal element. My main point: since the movie is so dark and was really tipping in that direction, maybe vigilante justice would be appropriate in this new Gotham that has been set up for us. It really is a terrific movie and I know I'm gonna catch hell for saying this, but please, PLEASE - for the next movie, let Batman kill off the heads of criminal organizations and maim their respective thugs. If not for people like me, do it for the children.

B0002S947K|5.0|Unpretencious, mature, simple, and very well crafted is how see things made by people I like. To me these are the critereia of a great poem, great beer as well as a great song. As an artist, Lamontagne fits right in. Every song on this album is a great thing to be a part of.  He is a rare and precious find in this world of mucho-consolidated-media-environment of forced-upon-you-through-no-choice-of your-own-in-your-face cr@p.    <br /> <br />Lamontagne is authentic.  He shows up as real, rare and true.  There are feelings from his music that come exploding from those long shut down places in my gut that I thought were closed when I feel his music.  Real places.  His music has helped know that I can feel again <br /> <br />Other artists that have been able to overflow the same voids in my life are Cobain, Van Gough, Waits, Bukowski, Paglia, Cambell, Hendrix, Haggard, pre-fame Guns and Roses, and of course Lady Mrs. Lynn.   <br /> <br />The connection between Lamontagne and these other artists is that even if fame and money was not a factor, their art would probably not come out any differently.  His music is true.  To me that is what makes this album and artist authentic.      <br /> <br />Please don't spoil him for me by making him too famous and putting his songs in commercials.  Listen wisely.  Enjoy.  I know you can; it's real.  Share him with your friends and come see him in concert when he comes around.  Enjoy this rare authenticity.  He's the real thing. <br /> <br />/'trouble' is a good song and if you can believe it, it is only the begining... <br />// I wish there was a way to abolish the '$' sign on a keyboard for a peace sign.
0754043355|3.0|The message of the story is good, but the way it is put makes reader depress.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb lies down on Broadway. The title itself is rather unusual. <br /> <br />It is the Best Genesis Album ever recorded, probably one of the best ever made in the History of music. It is irrelevant that the Album was not a number one hit, it still manage to sell really well even without a Hit single (there was no way \\"Counting out time\\" was gonna compete with Killer Queen by Queen at the time of its release). The point they made that at the time was that they were not a singles Band and believed in what they did. <br /> <br />The accompanying tour should be put on DVD, it will sell. There is a lot of footage around of Genesis but has never been sanctioned. <br /> <br />Awkward vein is something the Band were extremely good at and that is what separates Pre 1980 Genesis <br />From the pap that came. It seems a lot of acts post 1980 lost that Musical integrity and is something that has got way out of hand in 2005. <br /> <br />I never bothered to read the lyrics or the Story of Rael, the music was enough for me. <br /> <br />The Lamia is probably the strongest track of all Genesis tracks, its also brings out Steve Hacketts Solo piece to the fore (probably the most underrated Guitarist of all time) <br /> <br />Tony Banks was a Genius with the synths, Phil Collins Drumming sounded way ahead of its time and gives the Album a timeless sound. This is where the hard edge Genesis Sound started. The Album was a turning point regardless of Peter Gabriel's Departure. <br /> <br />This album came out at the Right time, and is the Ultimate Prog Rock Album. For those who have never heard the Album, just go and get it, ignore the other reviews and think for yourselves. It's a shame Prog rock is not retro.  <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After rave reviews from friends, and hearing bits of \\"Defying Gravity\\" I decided to purchase tickets for the Broadway show. While waiting to go see it, I thought it best to get acquainted with the music before seeing the show. I am so happy I did, because this musical is absolutely amazing. The songs are superbly performed, especially by the stars of the show Idina Menzel as the Wicked Witch, Elphaba, whose powerful voice and performance adds a touch of humanity to the witch, and Kristin Chenoweth as Galinda, and later Glinda, whose performance is absolutely perfect, her impeccable comic timing helps make the show, her songs are among the best on the CD. These songs are at times fun and light (\\"What is this Feeling\\" and \\"Popular\\"), sad and moving (\\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and \\"For Good\\"), and powerful and awe-inspiring (\\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"No Good Deed\\"). This entire show is spectacular, and based on the few pictures inside the book of lyrics; the visuals that accompany them look equally amazing.
B0001L3MI0|2.0|Well, it's been about a decade since this turkey landed in the theaters, and now we're all scratching our heads and wondering why it wasn't a total bomb from the start.  Must've been the cool, textured metallic skin of the alien ships (stolen from Star Wars' Death Star), the way things shake and rumble when the aliens arrive (stolen from \\"Close Encounters\\"), Will Smith's patter (stolen from \\"Fresh Prince\\"), Jeff Goldblum's sincere scientific nerdiness (stolen from \\"Jurassic Park\\"), the disc-shaped alien attack ships (Battlestar Galactica), Judd Hirsch playing a loquacious Jewish man (Taxi), the mass exodus from the doomed cities (The Day After), the migration of survivors through the ruins of Los Angeles (Earthquake), big beams of light incinerating entire metropolises (Star Wars again!), debating nuclear options in the bunker (Dr. Strangelove), the alien using nerd scientist as hand puppet (Star Trek), and the temporary unification of all the people of the globe through the force of a common threat (War of the Worlds).  While when viewed from a distance, and appreciated for all its logical and scientific screw-ups, this movie clearly sucks, you can see why folks were take in by it.  It's not a movie by itself, it is simply a montage of many other, better movies masquerading as an original effort. <br /> <br />And yes, the world would not be the same in the morning after several dozen fifteen-mile-wide behemoths crashed into the ruins of most of the globe's major cities (not to mention the \\"rain of fire\\" that would follow the detonation of the orbiting alien mother ship...oh my!).
B000002AP1|5.0|Everything you will ever need to know about this album can be found in Steven Wolfe's review, below: all other comments are superfluous.
B00005JNJT|4.0|After viewing Bale's shockingly realistic performance in the machinist, I was certain that he would be an inspired choice to play the dark knight.  <br /> <br />And having just watched a sneak preview of the movie, I can safely the directors will arrange Bale to do many more sequels. Similar to how Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker/ Spiderman to perfection, Bale does even better in his version of Batman.  <br /> <br />Take note of the characters played by Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman. They perform an excellent job of enhancing the character of Batman, rather than outshine him like the previous films.  <br /> <br />Fans of the comic book will also note how the creators of the film (credit to Christopher Nolan and David Goyer) kept the story close to the essence of the comic book, especially the parts when Gordon is talking to Batman (I shan't spoil it for you).  <br /> <br />But what struck me most was when Bale puts on the costume, he fits in seamlessly, both figuratively and literally. You can actually feel his menacing presence when Batman confronts the many villains during the fight scenes.  <br /> <br />The only disappointment i had was that Watanabe was not given enough screen time.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0156027321|3.0|Decent book, I expected more considering how much my friend raved all over it. It started out good enough, detailing piscine's life back in India but things begin to bog down a little in the middle. Luckily, the last couple of chapters and the ending make the entire book a worthwhile endeavor. A fable that isn't quite a fable is how I would best describe it.
B0009PVZWI|4.0|3.5 Stars <br /> <br />I find it equally funny how people snub those who like earlier works by the band. THOSE EARLY WORKS ARE THE REASON THEY ARE FANS! I do agree that simply wishing the band would put out more cd's of the same stuff is silly. (That's what Offspring has done and quite frankly it is getting tiresome). But I don't think this is the case here. For me, a fan ever since I heard My Hero, I have loved every single album the Foos have put out, until now. This album is good, but I would rate it below the other 4, or maybe equal with their self titled debut. I hope this will be taken as an honest assessment from a long-time devoted fan. <br /> <br />Observations: <br /> <br />I think the single, Best of You, is a bit contrived and forced, and while it's an okay song, it suffers from too much screaming. I don't mind Dave's screaming, and I think it works very well on other tracks, especially, Hell and In Your Honor. But think Dave goes overboard on the screaming in a misguided attempt to emphasize the rock disk. I think his screaming has worked best when it builds up, as in Monkey Wrench, All My Life, etc. Here, starting out screaming through whole songs gets a bit repetitive and deflates any build up or momentum to the song.  <br /> <br />As far as the first disk goes, I like a lot of the tracks, but with the exceptions of No Way Back, DOA and Hell, nothing really sticks out for me. It is a good fix for my Foo cravings, but nothing earth-shattering or eye-opening like previous efforts. (i.e. Big Me, Monkey Wrench or Everlong, Generator, or All My Life, Low). I think it is because they are trying to hard. Honestly, if I want really brilliant, hard rocking songs, I could listen to the first four tracks of One by One and be perfectly satisfied. Or I could listen to My Hero or Monkey Wrench.  Listen to this album and then listen to All My Life, Low, Have it All, and Times Like These. Notice the difference? I think those songs have melody to them. They are hard rocking, but are distinguishable. These songs, especially In Your Honor and Best of You, are drowned out by screaming and are too simplistic with the guitar work. The Foo Fighters can and have done better. Again, not asking for the same thing, but I do appreciate the complexity I have come to expect from the band. <br /> <br />What I don't really like about this album, and why I think its a bit sub-par, is the second acoustic disk. I am not a fan who gives an A for effort. I like the fact that they tried to do something different and I appreciate it, but honestly I think the second disk is boring. It puts me to sleep every time I listen to it. I like Miracle, and Another Round, but the other songs are dull. I do think On the Mend is also okay, but I can't help but think it would sound better with an electric guitar and at a slightly faster tempo. I think Grohl also missed the mark on Virginia Moon, featuring Norah Jones. It is a great concept, but what happens is he drowns her out. What's the point of having Norah Jones sing a duet if you can barely hear her? I thought the band could have done much better, like the work they did with the acoustic versions of everlong, my hero, and times like these. Again, those are distinguishable tracks and if you get a chance, check them out. Much better work than what they produced here.  <br /> <br />So, all in all, not their best effort. I don't think this album will kill the band, and a lot of other fans seem to really like it. Personally I think anyone who thinks this is the best Foo Fighter album hasn't listened to the others in a while or at all. I like complexity in songs and this album doesn't have as much of it as their past albums. I know some will feel free to flame away, but this is simply an honest assessment from a big time fan.  <br /> <br />This album is not a starter album.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|That was an excerpt from the title track. No matter how many times I've listened to this album, it never seems to get old. The reason being that the man in black had such a long and storied career that every song within this album is like a page taken right out of his life. It doesn't matter that a ton of songs are covers, they seem to fit him like a glove. I would immediately assume that the song \\"hurt\\" had something to do with him coping with his addictions back in the 70's (despite the weirdness of covering a nine inch nails hit song). The album would immediately move to the track \\"Give my love to rose\\" that he recorded earlier in his career but definitely sounds better here because of the torn and fragile quality that his voice brings to it. Here's the man in black covering all sorts of song and giving them his own unique edge. A depeche mode song here, a linda rondstadt song there and even a cover from Simon and Garfunkel! All in all, just great from top to bottom. Heartfelt, honest and just plain touching, listen to the songs and understand how closely they contrast the man's life. Country music will never have anyone as great as Johnny Cash.
0385336810|5.0|This book was fun and airy.  I loved the fact that Emma is human, you can actually picture yourself in her.  And with all her secrets coming out and the embarassment you end up rooting for her and also laughing at how she gets herself into predicaments.  I loved this book.  Kinsella is a genius-I hope she puts new books out soon.  I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it for someone who wants to get brought into the book with a humorous storyline and great writing.  :)
B0009PVZWI|3.0|Something needs to be said and done about this record company releasing a \\"limited edition\\" dual disc and charging up to $15 more than the standard 2 disc version. Most CD's today come out with a choice and there is no more than $3 price difference for those who enjoy the 5.1 surround sound Dual Disc. If that wasn't enough, ONLY the 2nd CD is in 5.1 Surround. What a disaster.. Look, I'm a fan, and this is a decent CD.. CD one is TOO heavy at times, and CD 2 is TOO boring at times, but overall it's an interesting double album concept and likeable record. JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE \\"LIMITED EDITION\\". There's nothing limited about it, and certainly not worth $14 dollars more than the standard version. So 4 stars for the actual record, and ZERO stars for the packaging and pricing!
B00005JMX6|5.0|I thought it was a really good movie, I am just lookin for the song towards the end when they leave the prom and are all celebrating in the limo, before david grey's song.  if anyone could tell me i would appreciate it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a self-professed movie-holic.  I have over 600 Laserdiscs, unknown number of VHS, and over 800 DVDs.   <br /> <br />I am an avid collector and presently have all the available seasons of all the shows on DVD that catch my interest:  Firefly, MASH, Cheers, All In The Family, Highlander, Dilbert, Millenium, Kung Fu, Soap, Home Improvement, Green Acres, Hogans Heroes, Gilligans Island, and probably others I am presently forgetting about. <br /> <br />I am also a SF and Fantasy devotee.  Not only in movies and TV, but also in books.   <br /> <br />Having been overseas serving with the US Military since 1/79, except for 8/96-10/97, I haven't watched much US TV recently.  I saw this TV DVD Box Set on sale and asked a couple friends about it.  They recommended it so I purchased it.   <br /> <br />The show was fantastic.  Not only did I watch the shows almost continously, I re-watched all of them that had commentary.  I then loaned the DVDs to two friends who also instantly fell in love with the series.   <br /> <br />The writing, acting, sets, storyline, plot, etc. was fantastic.  Even though I have been a SF and Fantasy fan since the '70s, I would still have enjoyed this series because of the acting and writing if it was set in the 'Wild West' or modern day Chicago.   <br /> <br />Since the VHS format came out back in the 80s I have only gone to the theaters 3 times; once when I was in a new location with nothing else to do, once for a new release my wife wanted to see, and the last time when I took my 7 year old to the SpongeBob movie.  However, I think I will make an exception to my normal boycott of the expensive theaters to see Serenity when it comes out in late 2005. <br /> <br />In the last 2 years I have seen some of the current US TV shows via what is available to us on US Military bases overseas.  The brief glimpses I have seen have shown nothing comparable to the quality of Firefly.   <br /> <br />Regards, Ralph
B0008KLVG4|5.0|If you've never bought Jaws on DVD before, this is the one to buy. If you bought the 25th Anniversary DVD, sell it off and buy this one. For $15 at your local Best Buy or Circuit City, you can get the widescreen version of the movie (or fullscreen if you have no taste), you can choose to either listen to the movie in 5.1 surround, DTS (if you have a convertor, and incidentally, these two formats were only available on separate discs previously) OR the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL MONO mix which was not previously available on any DVD pressing of this film. The last time it was available was on the laserdisc. This original mix has all of the ORIGINAL sound effects before they were tampered with on the substandard 5.1 mix (specifically the old whalesong when Quint finishes the Indianapolis Story). This presentation, with the uncut 2 hour classic documentary from the collectable laserdisc along with deleted scenes and a slew of production extras, AND a collectible book. FOR $15? and you people are COMPLAINING?!!?!? Give me a break.  Complaints about no commentary. Why do you need a commentary? The documentary interviewing everyone (including Spielberg) is over TWO HOURS!!! What more do you hope to learn from an additional commentary? THIS DVD is a true deal and I am VERY happy that I made this purchase, and yes I did buy the previous edition (which I will sell off shortly). If you love this film, I highly recommend picking up this DVD. For the amount of extras and presentation of the film, along with the low price, it is quite a deal. As for the double-dipping controversy, I side with those that say if you don't want to buy the new version, then don't buy it. There's no such thing as a definitive edition of a movie on a particular format. The formats are going to be constantly changing and new editions are going to be getting released and re-released. This is less of a black and white issue than  \\"the money-hungry studios are out to get me!!!\\" DVDs have gotten so cheap now, that an upgrade to a new edition can easily be justified. Again, I am happy that Universal put out this new edition and will happily support it.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This album is their best IMHO, yes it's better than Def. Maybe.  It's that good.  I might get flamed for this, but this album shows a mature side of the band, but keeping the angst-rock style that Oasis fans know and like.  There are two stand out tracks for each of the members and for the band as a whole.  Both \\"Lyla\\" and \\"Let there be Love\\" show the full band's potential, while \\"Importance of Being Idle\\" and \\"Mucky Fingers\\", two brillant songs I might add, show how Noel can not only hit the high notes but show his true music skill.  Liam's \\"Love Like a Bomb\\" and \\"Abel\\", show his songwriting skills and really showcase his singing talents.  Andy Bell's \\"Turn up the Sun\\" and \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" come on strong and end nicely, again showing that Liam is capable of delivering solid singing.  Gem gets his turn on \\"A Bell will Ring\\" and Zac (Ringo Star's son) demonstrates well how one can come into a band and get behind the kit and turn out some great moments, such as the fun and poppy, yet serious, \\"Meaning of Soul\\".  \\"Part of the Queue\\" is really the only song that is out of place on the album.  It could have had better placement, and comes on as more of a b-side than a solid album track.  Be sure to give this disc some spin time in your player, and if some don't agree that it is really good (which is perfectly ok) it is still a nice record to have in a collection.
B000001ESP|5.0|Although I agree that Rush have never made a bad album, this is, perhaps, their greatest overall effort from front to back.  Neil Peart's lyrics have never been more direct and to the point (he sometimes gets too obtuse even for an egghead like me!) and the music is just jaw-dropping.  Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Red Barchetta, Limelight, Witch Hunt, Vital Signs, and Rush's last epic, The Camera Eye (I think I listed the whole album!)...it's ALL excellent.  The musicianship is, of course, top-notch, but this album also seems to have perfect production...not too slick, but crisp and clean.  Everything sounds perfect, from Neil's drums to Geddy's rumbling bass and Alex's switchblade guitars.  This is the Rush album to start with if you're just getting into the band.  A masterpiece.
B00000J2SO|2.0|Bonnet has a great voice, but no wonder Dio left the band: Blackmore was going for a total mainstream assault, and he chose to play almost pop metal! DOWN TO EARTH is bad, very bad. It starts with a disgusting bad songa calling MAKIN LOVE (how creative...), which seems like a KISS left over... Thatn things go worser and worse from there, fo course with some good moments due to Ritchie's genius.
B00082ZS5W|4.0|Dido's new live dvd/cd combo doesn't pack a walloping punch in the visuals department, but the vocals are impressive. Dido does a great job of reinventing some of her songs to give them a better sound when performed live. However, a few of the songs don't lend well to being performed outside of the studio. All in all, this is a great value pack, as you get the dvd and cd combined for one low price. Standout tracks include: See You When You're 40, Hunter, Take My Hand, Don't Leave Home and Sand In My Shoes. Casual fans should enjoy this performance, but diehards will want to know who gave the Brixton Academy audience a sleeping pill before the show started. Come on y'all, she's a hometown girl...show her some love!!!!!
0446677450|1.0|Hm. I remember going through school and listening to my dad talk about free enterprise. His advice: Work hard, save your money. Don't go out to eat. Make your own clothes. Buy used cars and fix them yourself. Don't pay anybody to do anything that you can do yourself.  <br /> <br />Mom and Dad also said: Knowledge is power: What you have learned can never be taken away from you. (Except nowadays, those \\"smart\\" corporations make their employees sign non-disclosure agreements and won't let their brain trusts work in their fields for x years if they leave the company.) <br /> <br />And the standard advice for free enterprisers was always: Find a need and fill it. <br /> <br />Am I the only one who remembers all this? <br /> <br />But now, we're all supposed to flip real estate for money. We just had a big S&L crisis 20 years ago. We will just  never learn. <br /> <br />Welcome to America in the 21st century. <br /> <br />And yeah, I read the book and listened to his tapes. It's very telling that one of the other reviewers couldn't find a title to land or company belonging to Kiyosaki anywhere.
B000084T18|5.0|man 50 at his finist. this cd is one of the greatest in hip hop. this was before game, before too rich and before too many beefs. wit so many hits like 21 ?'s,in da club,wanksta, and P.I.M.P, this cd rocks tha club, Em did a great job on this cd. I'm now lookin foward to gettin power of a dollar which is 50's first album which was never released unfortently. Get this cd right away if ya don't have it best of the g unit. out.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|There is really only one bad review of this album based upon the music, and that was from someone who sounds like he's trying to sound like a music critic with his 4-point list for why he doesn't like this album. Yep, folks, you got it right - he's your typical \\"listen-to-me-I'm-know-what-I'm-talking-about\\" d**che bag who has no I idea what he's talking about. There's one in every review posting, isn't there?  <br />Opinions are like a**holes - everyone has one. And this a**hole says this is one of the strongest albums released by Grohl and co. Mature and polished, yet exhuberant and raw around the edges at the same time. This album will surely gain the FFs new fans and thoroughly satisfy the old ones.  <br />By the way I'm listening to this album right now... through iTunes... from my purchasd CD... People who can't figure out how to move songs from a 'copy-protected' CD really don't have much business buying an iPod. Stick with the Walkman and leave the confusing technology to the kiddies.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Everyone needs to listen up. Dream theater have been putting out a wide variety of sounds for years.. but enough of everyone trying to say that DT has gone downhill. To claim that this band has left its roots is completely senseless.. Why????? Because DT has always been about new things and because (i hate to burst the bubble of you doubters) DT can simply do whatever they want to do. I guess im not really reviewing the album here, simply defending it. You bums who are trying to say that DT is washed up are simply not getting it. DT is a genre all their own and in that genre they can do whatever they please. I'll purchase whatever they put out, because the musicianship they posess simply cant be found anywhere else. DT has rocked from the beginning, rocks now, and always will rock..... if you disagree.... Petrucci riffs will find you and vaporize you.
0783226888|5.0|...it's really freaking good.  I never saw the origional and actually up until 5 minutes ago while reading a review I didn't know it was a remake and so i think looking at a movie like that will give you a different view since you have nothing else to base it against.  I love Bruce so as far as I'm concerned he can do no wrong, but from what I remember this movie was actually really well done all the way around.  I've only seen this movie once and it was quite some time ago (about 5 years) so my memory of exact plot may be somewhat shody.  I do remember that Gere plays Declan who is an IRA terrorist sent to capture The Jackel played by none other than Willis...The Jackel's next assignment is to take out the First Lady.  The movie is fast paced, exciting and very well scripted as well as casted.  Gere is exceptional, and I don't normally care to much for him.  Willis is amazing as the assasin who is a total master of disguise.  There are still scenes that I remember clearly even 5 years down the road...like the scene where Willis tests his new gun (one of my favorites) and the scene where Willis strips the paint form his van (another favorite, just becasue it was really cool)...anyways, I'm sure you'll like the movie...but then again your not me so you may not.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Read all of the reviews up from the least helpful, the lowest rated, the most helpful to the highest rated. I think everyone has a point about it being good and bad. It was too patriotic, but it wasn't that horrible. In fact, I really enjoyed. The acting and casting were okay, the script a bit shaky and the fact that it didn't have subtitles kinda sucked, but beyond that, it was good. Worth buying, gives you some bonus stuff, not the kind of movie to watch for historical facts.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I found the liner notes of the record when I was very young, and was enchanted with the story.  This movie, set in 1922, is a comedy, thriller, mystery, romance and musical all rolled into one.<br /><br />One day, I saw the original movie on late night t.v., and it instantly became my all-time favorite.  It was just so much fun! So silly, and so great seeing a young Mary Tyler Moore; and Carol Channing and Julie Andrews were in top form. I loved all the wacky dance numbers, and the music was terrific. I loved the authentic period details that the director had clearly gone to a great deal of trouble to produce.  Since there are several key scenes in Chinatown, this movie could be fun to watch with someone else while eating Chinese takeout. It's a bit long, though...it even has an intermission.  Making a couple of minor allowances for attitudes of the time, it is a happy, feel-good movie, and it will put a smile on your face.<br /><br />(btw, this movie, the original Thoroughly Modern Millie, is quite different from the modern stage musical.  Sadly, all the music is different in the stage version.)
B0009HLDFU|3.0|This is by far the best album of 2005 so far, and very high up in the Foo Fighters's list.  <br /> <br />However, with that said, I BOUGHT the CD today, and in order to play it on my PC, I had to download the songs so I wouldn't have to install their spyware!   <br /> <br />Boo too the Foos on this one.  I want my money back.  Once again just goes to show that copy protection only hurts the honest customer.  I had NO problem downloading it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was living in England and just moving back to the states when Parachutes came out and was extremely impressed with it. In fact since then I have heard very little new american music I could listen to.<br /><br />When I first listened to \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" I told my friends and anyone else who would listen that I had heard the last great rock and roll record I will probably ever hear in my lifetime (I am 46 and have been totally disapponted with rock in the last 5 years).<br /><br />It was with a bit of trepidation that I listened to X&Y for the first time a little over a week ago. First off it did not grab me like the first two. I think I would have rated it a 3. It sounded too smooth and I was sort of influenced by the reviews calling it generic Coldplay. After 4 days it grew on me to the point where I would say it was worth 4 stars.<br /><br />For various reasons I have listened to no music for the last 4 days and finally put X&Y on again tonight. Call it a delayed reaction but it was awesome. Every single song is a 9 or 10. It must be more subtle then the first two (Yellow and The Scientist are still my favorite tracks that can bring tears to my eyes) but X&Y is a masterpiece. Every song sounds distinct and well crafted. I won't say it is the last great rock record to be made this time because I think that they may do it a fourth time.<br /><br />These guys are definitely now in my top 5 bands of all time.
B000683VI4|5.0|I thought this was a beautiful movie. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry, and Gena Rowlands and James Garner are incredible. A great film. The DVD is also outstanding with plenty of additional material that is interesting and adds details of how much care went into making this movie.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Track two on this album is a wasted un-listen-able track. Their worst song yet ...the American Idol, canned, made for radio ballads are far better than this sad excuse for a \\"song\\" ... I could have written a more interesting song if I farted into a drum machine... and made up some lyrics about sunshine and sweet feelings. <br /> <br />I mean the sentiment of the lyrics are fine ...but wrap them in a decent song PLEASE !!! <br /> <br />It's a crime to publish a song like that... they probably wrote and learned it in the car on the way to the studio. Or at least I hope that's the excuse. So it's filler ...I'd suppose ...but I'd rather hear a 4 minute piano ditty or Port Mikenoy playing the spoons with his nipples ....anything but this waste of a track.  <br /> <br />I'll listen to the rest of it ...and hopefully it will redeem that track.  <br /> <br />One track does not pan the album but I had to comment on it because its such an egregious example of poor songsmenship. <br /> <br />Its still Dream Theater...I'll buy their albums no matter what there's always a gold nugget contained within somewhere that makes the purchase price worth it. <br /> <br />But they better start playing BLind Faith LIVE !!! <br />
B0007TKNL0|1.0|For a movie that was a long time in the making, the final result was an atrocity that only shows how Hollywood has lost its sparkle.  The magic is gone... and it's a shame that \\"Phantom\\" was finally made during such a dry-spell. <br /> <br />The Phantom of the Opera was the first musical I saw as a child.  I was maybe 11 or 12 years old and it was a turning point.  It made me realize the brilliance of acting, of music, and of the arts as a whole.  I became and actor and a writer and Phantom was always one of my favorite shows... but it should have been left on the stage. <br /> <br />Simply put, this movie had a lot of potential... but when you make a movie of a musical, you can't stage it the same way.  Things that work onstage just don't read the same on film... and like other musical bombs such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago which strived to introduce a younger, pop audience to the arts and musical theatre, Hollywood robbed the plays of their artistic integrity.  This movie demands a strong, powerful presence yet the title role was repulsively given to the weakest vocals in the entire cast.  And why...?  Because for some reason, our buddy the Phantom had to be sexy enough to sell the movie like an excrutiatingly long rock video.  Cudos to the actor who played \\"Raoul\\" -- he completely overshadowed the majestic, painful darkness of the depressed Phantom.  What we're left with is an antagonist who  sings every line with same flat, boring conviction (or lack there of).  The hand gestures are too indicitive and reek of interpretive movement.  There are often moments where you feel the actors in need of something to do, or a place to put their hands because there's simply no direction in the scene. <br /> <br />Where Chicago went right was with taking the show to a new medium.  They weren't entirely faithful to the stage structure.  They kept what they could but butchered what didn't work.  Phantom failed to do that, and although I complained that Chicago was a let down after seeing how much was cut and misinterpreted, I think losing some of the symbolism and subplots were worth it in the end... as long as it didn't turn out like Phantom. <br /> <br />This isn't a matter of being upset over a lack of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman -- in fact, I'm not a fan of their interpretation either.  Frankly, for those who want a Phantom that overflows with impressive vocal range AND emotion, there is only one voice cast that gives chills and goosebumps.  While a short recording, the Highlights from the Original Canadian Cast on one CD is far superior to any I have ever heard.  Not only do the actors take their songs beyond the written score both lyrically and vocally, their ability to portray Opera singers is far more believable, as their depth and range seem more fleshed out.  Of course, the infamous reunion of Colm Wilkinson and Rebecca Caine (who were previously father and daughter in Les Miserables together) is also a major selling point, but Wilkinson carries the show simply because there's something sinister in his voice. <br /> <br />Being the Phantom isn't just about putting on a mask... it's about a painful tortured childhood and a misguided soul who found solace is woman who was just as empty and alone and in need of a passionate release through music.  This movie throws away many powerful lines that would normally jerk tears from its audience and I blame that on some bad casting and too much need to recreate a stage masterpiece on film.  Honestly, when your supporting cast is better than the leads, you know you have a problem.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I was anxiously waiting for Shakira to release her new album, yet I was also worried that it would not be as good as her previous releases. When I first listened to this album the songs &quot;En Tus Pupillas&quot; , &quot;La Tortura&quot; , and &quot;Escondite Ingles&quot; really stood out for me. The album is excellent and greatly varies from song to song. To me there's nothing worse than an album in which every song is the same! Her beautiful voice and talent for writing and producing really come through on this album. Buy it now to hear a real artist for a change!!
B0006J28KU|4.0|For viewers of this two-disc DVD transfer of Michael Mann's taut cops-and-robbers film, crime pays splendid dividends. It's not just the classic pairing of Al Pacino as the relentless cop and Robert DeNiro as the dedicated robber. Aside from their contrasting acting styles, and that of a smart supporting cast, Mann's original screenplay is as focused on character as it is on a trio of high-tech heists. The cinematography, notably of Los Angeles in a co-starring role, and the tense score are state-of-the-art.<br /><br />\\"Heat\\" is not without cliche. There is the wife who whines about her heroic cop not spending time home with the kid (when was the last time you saw a supportive screen wife?) There is a bravura bank hold-up in which police provoke a bullet-spraying gunfight amid passers-by (when was the last time your PD risked this?) There is the suicidal adolescent (Natalie Portman, impressive even then), the psycho sex killer, and the bad guys with troubled hearts.<br /><br />But who cares how many times someone asks \\"hey, you all right?\\" when everyone else is so right? Pacino and DeNiro share little screen time (a traffic stop, a pungent conversation over coffee, a climactic shoot-out), but that's all they need, so effectively have they registered elsewhere; witness DeNiro confering with hood Jon Voight, caring for a wounded Val Kilmer and romancing Amy Brenneman, who is quite touching. It's a rare crime movie (apart from Scorcese's) that gets as exciting and all-encompassing as this.

B0002OERI0|1.0|first of all the term punk rock opera is just dumb.  green day was alright then they became \\"political\\".  this cd is a pretty lame attempt at being political. \\"dont wanna be an american idiot\\"...billie joe has become an american dumbass. nice makeup buddy. the cd is their worst and most bland in their career.  nofx made the decline years ago which is way more of a \\"punk rock opera\\" (whatever that term even means) that the media keeps callin this cd.  green day is no longer original or talented and the majority of their fan base consists of those aged 10-15.  their last tour even had a room for parents to go and watch movies while their kids watched the show at some of the dates. pretty punk rock you politcal junkies.  the cd says more about pre-teen angst than anything that evenly remotely resembles an educated or philosophical argument about politics or  what is going on in the world today.  the music is overly simplistic and bland. green day needs to stop this foolish nonsense and start playing fun music like they used to instead of trying to do whatever they are trying to do. maybe they could even stop with the make up. who am i to say so though.
B00008EY65|2.0|Yes, the art direction was first class. It moved along well, the acting and tone was perfect for a comic book movie. BUT, what the heck was the plot all about? Who needed Hellboy? Everybody could have knocked off early and gone out for a beer if they just let the character with pyrokenesis fry the baddies in the first place. And, the ultimate demon from the darkside gets taken out with grenades? Talk about the ultimate anti-climax. Who knew that the forces of evil were such a light load? Another second rate comic book movie.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This, ladies and gentlemen, is definetley Kubrick's finest (or at least #2). Watching this film is like looking at a great moving portrait, thanks to Kubrick's excellent cinematography, and the choice to film it with a Ziess superspeed lense (which made it possible to film by pure candlelight). This film; this beautiful, beautiful film; is a film that is about not just one person in particular at a particular date and time, but is about all mankind and the flaws that we have and all of our sins that we will always commit. About how we may do anything to get what we want and deeply desire.
B0001906O0|5.0|I read through all the reviews for this CD collection and didn't see much focusing on the songs, so I thought I'd give my thoughts here on songs I liked and why. <br /> <br />Disc 1: 10:15 on a Saturday Night everyone's heard a zillion times, but the original Staring at the Sea mix was very quiet, whereas this one is volume boosted for modern stereos. (Just like all the other tracks on this compilation). Thank you! <br /> <br />Do the Hansa is a funny song poking fun of The Cure's early relationship with Hansa records (as detailed in the excellent liner notes). Another Journey by Train is the standout song on this CD, their first instrumental. Think of the \\"train tracks\\" closing sounds from Jumping Someone Else's Train, and you'll appreciate how this track compliments it. Descent is a quiet and moody instrumental, one can feel touches of A Forest in this. <br /> <br />Just One Kiss is a poppy little song that drums like The Hanging Garden, a nice feel. The Exploding Boy is something Robert Smith wrote upon feeling the weight of success, very spritely. A Few Hours After This is an interesting track, although after a few replays the overbearing keyboards get on your nerves.  <br /> <br />Disc 2: A common theme on a lot of these tracks (and much early Cure for that matter) is for most of the song to be an instrumental, with Robert's vocals coming in for the latter third of the song. And so it is with many tracks on this CD, such as Breathe and Icing Sugar. Icing Sugar has a guest sax player that really improves the track over what made it onto Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me.  <br /> <br />A Chain of Flowers is a very touching song about a girl's funeral, \\"please wake up\\". Robert's guitar is particularly haunting on this one. Sugar Girl is a delight, giving those light melodies that only Robert Smith could pull off. How Beautiful You Are is shorter than the Kiss album version, but it's just a different edit that works fine. To The Sky is just a delight as Robert sets up a hypnotic beat and chorus. Unusual for The Cure, yet beautiful.  <br /> <br />Babble and Out of Mind are familiar to those who have the Fascination Street CD single, for some reason I don't like listening to them out of that sequence. 2Late and Fear of Ghosts were also on the Lovesong CD single, nothing new there. The final standout on this CD is Harold and Joe, with vocals reminiscent of Wrong Number and similar light touches.  <br /> <br />Disc 3: This CD has some of the strongest tracks of the compilation, making one wonder why a lot of these were unreleased. I think the answer is that Robert Smith is the creative genius who makes these songs, and so he's too close to them or he's played them too many times to like them as much as we do. Be grateful he's releasing them now, they could actually tour off this material if you ask me. <br /> <br />This Twilight Garden opens this CD, alone worth paying for the collection. The stunning Cure \\"dreaminess\\", for lack of a better term, is fully in play here. This song just carries you away with its fantasy sound, amazing. Play has beautiful guitar work and thoughtful lyrics (or is that redundant?). Halo, Scared as You, The Big Hand, A Foolish Arrangement follow sequentially, all great to put on your playlist. I love the opening to Arrangement.  <br /> <br />Burn of course is from the Crow soundtrack, easily their best soundtrack work next to Carnage Visors (which is on the Faith reissue). It Used to be Me has a great chorus, and a relentless beat that draws you in. Ocean has some nice moments, rather like love poetry set to music as all of Bloodflowers seemed to be. <br /> <br />Disc 4: The weakest CD of the compilation, marking the direction of The Cure as others have noted. This is a Lie is a standout as a thoughtful track, with delightful orchestral arrangements. The remixes of Wrong Number and Forest did nothing for me, although others like them. More Than This is probably the best track of this CD, sounding like a Duran Duran song with Robert Smith dropped in over Simon Lebon. Not a Cure song, which is why Robert left it unreleased, but still a delight to hear him sing and play.  <br /> <br />Maybe Someday has a delightful opener and great vocals by Robert, again, why was this not the main single of his newer work? That's the curse of the creative genius, they make great stuff and then run with something else. But we get to hear it now(\\"someday...\\"), so everything's okay. Signal to Noise acoustic is a nice bonus that was apparently left off the Acoustic CD that comes with special versions of the Greatest Hits collection. Nice to get a bonus to that CD, which in itself is a treat. <br /> <br />I shelled out the money for this collection on a lark and have not regretted it. There is a ton of new stuff here, especially for those of us who don't have 100+ maxisingles like some Cure fans. This collection will give many many listenings of great music, for any sort of Cure fan. <br /> <br />I must make a regretful announcement for those considering spending the money on this collection. A few months after this hit the shelves, they issued two-CD remasters of Seventeen Seconds, Faith, and Pornography. I have listened to all three remasters in great detail, and the songs that others lament are not included on Dots are largely on these releases. Sad to say, the additional songs on those three reissues are priceless and amazing, buy them too.  <br /> <br />That's a lot of new Cure to have to pay for, but Dots and the Three reissues for their early albums are worth every penny. They are a delight, thank you to Robert Smith and his bandmates for being such prolific musicians. Even their \\"rejected\\" material is better than what most bands put out.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Poor Britney Spears. I actually feel sorry for this woman. I have watched Britney Spears show \\"Chaotic\\", and she is a really nice person. I don't care if you hate her music, you have to admit that she is one of the nicest superstars around. But... most of her music is horrendous. \\"Do Somethin'\\" just makes me want to rip my f$%king ears off. The only good song on the Greatest Hits release are \\"Me Against the Music\\", so that is why I decided to give Britney at least one star. I would love to meet her, because she seems like such a nice, carefree person, but she needs to retire before she fades into oblivion, which is already happening.
074325144X|5.0|I've always hated running, mostly because every time I tried to cover any significant distance it caused pain in my shins and lower back. This book changed my perspective. Dryer's tips and tricks really do work! I'm able to perform much better with a whole lot less discomfort. The step-by-step approach is easy to follow and quickly apply. Important concepts covered include mental focus, body sensing, breathing, relaxation, posture, and gravity-assisted running. As a martial arts instructor these ideas truly resonate, though most anyone can take advantage of them. Other subjects include the typical cool down, stretching, diet, muscle groupings, and other basics that most folks already know about.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction
0671027344|5.0|This book is tied for first in my top ten favortie books. I was going through books at a local book store and I read the back of this one and it sounded interesting. Once I started it I couldn't put it down. I, myself, am a high school student and though I cannot relate to the exact events that happen in this book, I do know people who have gone through similar experiences. I just felt that I could relate to each and every character in some way or another. The way I can tell if I have a good book is: I am reading and when i absolutley must put the book down, I don't ever remember turning the page. I dont' remember turning a page in this book. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|People can say good and bad about any foo record. However, I believe the band has accomplished an amazing piece of music with In Your Honor. The band has matured immensely and poured a ton of passion into the record. Listen the the lyrics, the guitar work, the drum work and any true appreciator of rock music, and poetic acoustic recordings will know this is a real artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br />In addition, all fans should bow down to the band. For many many artists in the world of corporate productions today you would see price gouging for a 2 CD set. Yet you can purchase \\"In Your Honor\\" for less than your usual untalented over produced one CD record. Give the band a hand folks, they want you to enjoy their music, not only profit from you.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Buller is a trickster. He wants one last day of freedom before he has to go back to the bores of High School. So he fakes being sick, yet again to his sister's disgust. The Principal then realizes that Ferris is simply taking days off and wants to catch him in the act of being not sick. Ferris then calls up his friends and they head to the windy city for fun and excitement.<br /><br />John Hughes has done it again. The master of 80's movies has created a solid, quirky movie about a boy that just wants to have fun. His writing's outstanding here, he had made me laugh everytime that I watch this movie. Also, his direction is brillance. Matthew Brodick is Ferris. Nobody else could probably do the part as easily as he did. He really took the role, and made it his own. I was cracking up at whatever he was doing, and I had a solid time watching this flick because mainly he makes it enjoyable.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I picked this up yesterday for $15. The fact that people are crying because of this being a double dip is just sad. I'll explain why at the end of my review.<br /><br />On this disc you get not only Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 (which were only available on separate discs until now), you get the film's original soundtrack without any of the changes they made. Not only that, you get an amazing two hour documentary which is worth the cost of the disc alone. If you love this movie, you will treasure this documentary. You get a 60 page commemorative photo book, more deleted scenes and other extras as well.<br /><br />Folks, I hate double dipping as much as any of you. But the fact of the matter is, the last DVD release of the original \\"Jaws\\" was five years ago. It's not a case like \\"I, Robot\\" or \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", which got \\"Super-dee Dooper Collector's Chewy Chocolate Editions\\" mere months after their DVD releases. I sincerely doubt we'll see a more definitive DVD of Jaws at this point unless it came with Robert Shaw's ashes. If you don't want it, don't get it. I think for the amount it's going for, it's more than a bargain.
B0007NFL18|1.0|This whole &quot;I'm such a big pimp with a bunch of girls as skinny as sticks effing me but you should feel kinda bad for me because I really had a bad life&quot; thing is getting annoying. Fast. 50 Cent is like all other rappers, always showing off his riches.

From this album we can see how 'manufactured' 50 cent is, with corny and cheap tracks. <br /> <br />You either hate it or love it......u either hate it becuase you have comman sense or you love it becuase you are up 50 cents arse(ass 4 u americans). <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|I cannot tell you how happy I was to finally get a DVD to replace the six over-used VHS tapes that I had been faithfully watching  over the past five years. I also cannot tell you how dissapointed I was when the picture appeared to be cast in a blurry looking greenish-blue color. Thoroughly dissapointed, I tossed the DVD to the back of the video cabinet and retrieved my old VHS tapes. IF THIS HAS HAPPENEND TO YOU, TRY ANOTHER TV! Months later, I pulled out the DVD and played it on an old plain jane 19in color tv that had been in the basement for years. (the first tv I had played it on was a projection tv, not a picture tube tv.)Much to my surprise the color and clarity were beautiful. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were once again flawless. You can imagine my relief and elation. At this point, I will not attempt to give you and in depth review of the movie other then to say it is absolutely superb. there are over 600 other 5 star reviewers who agree with this opinion. I think the numbers speak for themselves. My only hope with this review is that it may possibly help a fellow Janeite or Pride and Prejudice fan. Sincerely, G.S.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This movie does more then show you what its like to be suffering from sleep psychosis.. it actually imposes the problem on you. If your seeing it for the first time, you can expect to enjoy a movie where you really have to pay attention to every detail. A movie where you have to watch it mutiple times to unlock all the hidden riddles and nuances a intellectual piece. Christian Bale's acting is cutting edge.. no actor can pull off these complex roles like he can. The Bale factor brings this movie up to elite standards for psychological horror. The fact that Christian starves himself and really gets into his character makes the likeness of Trevor Reznik very palpable and captivating. The dark depressed mood of the film is instantuated not only by Trevor's listlessness but also by the setting of the movie in Los Angeles where Trevor works in a monotonous factory working on machines. Trevor's life is purposelessly drifting, from coffee shops to bars to whores. Something seems to be bothering Trevor and he's like a ghost haunting his abysmal surrounding with no inkling, except the mysterious notes he writes in his moments of lucid intellection amidst his hallicinations. The clues he unearths in his psychotic sleep deprived delusions,  day by day in his dismay and suprise he discovers these little notes, slowly these little clues chip away at his pysche. As his repressed past that he has buried in self-defense in his sub-concious, begins eating away at him like a worm in a rotten apple. Soon Trevor can't hide anymore and he is forced to face the truth. The truth that has drove him into a year of insomnia and denial, the truth that he's not even aware of until the movie completely unfolds. This movie takes you through the unraveling of pyschological states. This movie very eloquently shows the viewer what sort of dark things lay in the sub-concious, and the power of the sub-concious to make one aware of it. The beauty of this movie is you get to feel like its happening toyou. Above all else this movie is philosophically insightful if one takes it seriously, the pyschological states explored give one a unique perspective on the influence of sub-concious states and their role in dream states and concious cognitive states. The lines are blurred in this film and the checks and balances are confounded because some acts such as the one Trevor Reznik commits overwhelm the sub-concious mind, and in order to balance the system of pyschological processes the repression has to be acknowledged and come to terms with on all three levels. In the end of the movie Trevor restores that balance and finally goes to sleep. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent cinema, and can appreciate a movie that'll make you think and not just take up your time like so many other films.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|In an earlier review, someone mentioned something along the lines of this double disc Foo Fighters release being ambitious. I wholeheartedly agree. I think that In Your Honor is a nice mix. While a double disc set is a very ambitious undertaking, I think Foo pull it off rather nicely. You could probably make the argument that you could have taken some songs off each disc and made a really great single disc, but I find myself asking why? Each disc is solid. Yeah, Dave Grohl does do the usual screaming bit and plays the power chord, but sometimes simplicity is just as well. The acoustic disc was actually better than I thought it would be. For some bizarre reason, I was thinking that it was going to be strictly a acoustic guitar disc. Not the whole band. A pleasant surprise, if you will. There are those that like to typecast Grohl in the Nirvana mold. Get over it. This is an entirely different beast. Besides, there was never any real guarantee that Nirvana would even be around today if Cobain hadn't selfishly taken his life. Anyway, I digress. I foresee In Your Honor getting some heavy rotation in my stereo.
B000067IZ3|4.0|This is an intense and gritty though brief cross-section of the \\"war on drugs\\".  (Although after watching, you may be tempted to call it the so-called \\"war on drugs\\".)  Michael Douglas is Wakefield, a judge who thinks that pushing treatment options balances out his heavily pro-prosecution leanings in narcotics cases. Wakefield's beautiful and intelligent daughter (Erika Christensen) herself is slowly falling under the spell of drugs and, by the film's end, proves capable of doing anything for a hit. Pegged to become the next Federal Drug Czar, Wakefield's strategy depends on bringing his brand of justice to Mexico where the lines between the law and the criminals frequently blurs if not disappears altogether. (If you're car is stolen, Mexican police will tell you who has to be paid before they can \\"find\\" your car.) The plan's master flaw in law enforcement strategies is that the drug war in Mexico is more complicated than simply cops v. dealers.  On the illicit side of the war, the conflict is not seen as one between the law and law breakers, but between different cartels - each jockeying to enlist corrupt police and military leaders in their favor.  (Mexican law enforcement, a character observes, is an entrepreneurial pursuit.)  A seemingly fearless and moral Tijuana cop, Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro), discovers this when reluctantly co-opted into the larger drug war by the mythic General Salazar. Salazar's methods require a fair amount of psyche-warfare against friend and foe alike (suspected traitors dig their own graves while prisoners with information are swamped with kindness so they'll turn). When Rodriguez suspects Salazar's crackdown to be cover for one supposedly crushed cartel to regroup, he breaches security and runs for the Americans. Linking American narcotics officers and the Mexicans is a south-California businessman Carlos Ayala, (Steve Bauer) whose various corporations amount to a shell game used to conceal a vast drug empire. When one of Ayala's underlings Ruiz, (Miguel Ferrer - the one whose script lines are meant to convey the futility of the drug war) is arrested on the eve of a massive coke bust, Ayala gets arrested as well, and it falls onto his now besieged wife (a very pregnant Catherine Zeta Jones) to save the family.  Soon, she learns that this will require her to restore its links to the drug trade, by all means necessary.  <br /> <br />Though freely taking shots at the drug-war, \\"Traffic\\" doesn't so much push a point as tell a story, leaving us to base our own conclusions (the only difference is that we'll now have to think twice about them). Soderbergh directs his characters well - the performances are actually understated for a film this topical. Each of the story arcs has its own special cinematography highlighting the seeming distance from the drug war's front lines and the after-effects of a hit: the Wakefield story is generally shot in cool blue colors with static shots and high-grain film, implying a clear frame of mind. Zeta-Jone's scenes are filmed in a sunny yellow, using smooth shots but quick cuts - hinting at how the orderliness of her life is on the verge of collapse. Best of all are Mexican scenes, shot in very grainy film using harsh yellow filters - never letting us forget the harsh pressures and ceaseless anxiety that hounds those at the source of the drug economy. Soderbergh further flavors the mix with a low-grade electronic score which seems both from an episode of \\"In Search Of...\\" yet perfectly balanced for this film. Even the captions seem to date the film to the 1970s (using typed captions instead of computer characters, as if the film were completed a week after \\"The Andromed Strain\\").  This was a powerful film for so many reasons, not the least of which is the way it mirrors its subject - it draws you in and blows your mind.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I guess I never really expected Chris Cornell to mix so well with the remaining members of RATM. When I heard of this collaboration, I remember thinking a couple things: Rage was always a pretty political band with outspoken points of view, so how would Chris Cornell mix with that. Answer: not bad since Zack was a good sized portion of the politicized portion of Rage, with apologies to Tom. The other question was: how would the remaining members of RATM stack up against Cornell and what he did with Soundgarden? Soundgarden wasn't exactly the definition of sunshine in the world of rock. They just kinda sludged along, which made them one of the most underrated rock bands in my oh so humble opinion.  <br />I can't really compare Out of Exile to the debut Audioslave disc for the simple reason I never gave the debut album much of a chance. It may seem contary to the aforementioned explanation, but I really wasn't buying this collaboration. I pretty much bought Out of Exile on a pure whim and the fact that someone played Be Yourself on the jukebox at the bar. I found it catchy THEN took the chance. I'm glad I did take the chance. It's a pure rock album. It's that simple. There are times where Tom's experimentations on the guitar tend to work on my nerves, but that's just his style. At least they're not sampling anyone or anything (so I would like to believe). I'd have to say that I'm really digging #1 Zero, The Worm, and Doesn't Remind Me at the moment. But I'm a fairly opinated guy, so that may change.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|MiB2 was fun to watch, but when it's over, it's hard to separate the flick from the first movie which it follows in just about every way - with the painful exception of just how edgy its premise was at first. For anybody who forgot (or has been \\"neuralized\\"), the MiB are a hyper-secret bureaucracy that monitors aliens on Earth, while preventing any other Earthlings from doing the same. The joke is 2-fold: while hidden, the aliens themselves are so prevalent among us that there's no mystery to them at all, and the fact that Earth is surrounded by myriads of powerful and oft hostile alien civilizations is an acceptable fact of life, as long as nobody on Earth finds out about it. The punch-line of each joke is that, if you think somebody's either an alien or one of the Men in Black, you're probably right (pop-stars, mail men, politicians...) The other joke is that MiB is the latest in a short line of films that combine the esoteric (alien civilizations) with the mundane (a huge government bureaucracy with no oversight) - the other great example was \\"Ghostbusters\\", with pre-modern demigods and the legions of the dead having to battle a blue-collar exterminators.  <br /> <br />As in the first flick, the joke works too well - if aliens are Earth's worst secret, why bother to keep it secret at all? (The joke might work if the script gave our heroes more inventive ways to keep spectacular extra-terrestrials secret, instead of merely wiping clean the minds of witnesses using handheld flash-bulbs called \\"neuralizers\\") As in the first flick (deja-vu?) Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) must prevent an evil alien from obtaining a powerful weapon with which to conquer the universe. Only Agent K knows the location of \\"The Light\\" - which was thought to have been launched into space by K years ago (in an incident comparable to an interstellar Potstdam, and immortalized in a cheesy amateur documentary by underground UFO watchers; apparently, the makers of the documentary weren't neuralized - which only raises the question of why anybody bothers to even try wiping clean those ridiculous and unbelievable memories). Seerlana (Lara Flynn Boyle) - an evil alien who manages to stay sultry even when she's got tendrils sprouting from everywhere - wants the light, and moves to conquer MiB HQ in her bid to extract its location from K's mind. (The ease with which she overruns HQ is only one more sign of the script's lameness).  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, as in the last film, the script's conceit works against itself: the MiB work so hard to convince you there's no alien menace, that you begin to believe them - and soon forget the story. Spectacular FX are undermined by our everybody's' unwillingness to be bowled over by anything. The script does make great use of Tommy Lee Jones as the perfect interstellar bureaucrat and Will Smith as the \\"new hotness\\". The story could have used more of Rip Torn, and whatever Linda Fiorentino asked for, they should have paid. In short, I finished this flick wondering if I'd been neuralized.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Hilarious!! This movie had me on the floor from the first few minutes watching.  Stephen Chow's latest movie is his best yet.  This is better than Shaolin Soccer!!  This movie has a particular humor to it and may not appeal to all viewers.  It is twisted, violent, and surreal.  Plot:  The axe gang is taking over.  Two thugs pretend to be part of the axe gang trying to collect money in a town where people laugh at them, because the town all seem to be kung fu masters.  The real axe gang comes to town and the fun begins. Not your typical movie and from what I have heard this is the #1 selling HONG KONG movie.  Check it out for a few good laughs!!
0141439513|4.0|This book has well earned it's reputation as wonderful, but I would be much more inclined to place it in the romance section of the library than alongside Civil Disobedience and Wuthering Heights. Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!<br /><br />For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy! Oh, dosn't Darcy reming you of Andrei??? Darcy's taller, but - PERHAPS - Andrei's pride is under more control. lolol<br /><br />A Good Read<br /><br />she who is no longer the Angel of Music
B00005JNJT|5.0|I won off a radio station tickets to see the premire of this movie, The movie was awesome in general, I also saw the I-max version which was the 1st I-max movie I have ever seen that was not about dolphins. The movie itself was incredible, you see how Bruce became Batman, his training and why he is Batman. You him take on the Scarecrow (who looks like the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz and any one in the band slipknot had a child), If you have a chance go see this movie as an I-max, You will not be dissapointed
B0002OERI0|5.0|Jimmy, you are right. I bought this album after hearing \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and, yes, it BLEW ME AWAY! I cannot take this out of my CD player, my car stereo, my iPod, my...you get the picture. My favorite is \\"Holiday\\", an anti-war song which sounds downright gleeful.  You have to hear it to believe it. Don't miss the drums on \\"St. Jimmy\\" - UNREAL! Now remember to \\"Wake me up when September ends\\" and I'll live a happy life.
B0006L16N8|2.0|The highly anticipated third album from Coldplay comes as a huge dissapointment.  After all of the hype over it and considering how long they claim it took them to produce this album, I must say I am not impressed.  There is nothing new to be found here and when compared to their first two albums, I believe they really took a couple of steps backwards here.  I find the lyrics to be redundant, Chris Martin's voice begins to get on my nerves after the first five songs, and the rest of the band does not seem like they improved at all on their respective instruments.  Hopefully they will take those much needed steps forward on their next album that I was so hoping for on this one.
B00009P1O2|5.0|These four guys were really at their best when they performed at Wembley in 1986, even though some people rumored the band was about to dissolve (and by the way, they had lost some or their force when they made \\"Hot Space\\"- except for \\"Under Pressure\\"). But things changed with the recording of \\"The Works\\"! This is really the visual history of \\"a beautiful day\\". <br /> <br />The new edition has a second DVD with unseen footage of lovely and unforgettable moments in a Queen's day. This is one of the best DVD buys I've ever made... I want to watch it over and over again! It sort of gives me energy; it's like seeing a great movie. <br /> <br />Whether you are a Queen fan or just curious, you'll love it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Everyone from Bowie to Byrne has been raving about this band, and it's not hard to see why. Their songs are engaging and eclectic, evoking classic Talking Heads, Pixies and even Bjork, when Regina sings. <br /> <br />Virtually every song is excellent on the album, from the wonderful 'Neighborhood 1: Tunnels' to the epic closer 'In The Back Seat'. Other highlights include the gospel driven 'Wake Up' and the punchy 'Neighborhood 3: Power Out'. <br /> <br />I was lucky enough to see them live a few months ago and they were absolutely brilliant - if you get the chance to see them do.  <br /> <br />And also their debut EP is very good as well, although not up the standard of 'Funeral'.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I don't know much about heavy metal music - and even less about the heavy metal band Metallica - but I do know that I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,\\" an incisive and insightful documentary that is less about a particular group of rock musicians than it is about human relationships and the raw, unvarnished emotions that those relationships lead to.<br /><br />In what turned out to be a fortuitous bit of timing for directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, filming on the project began in January 2001, right at the moment when the three remaining members, Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett had decided - for the sake of the band's future and the future of themselves as individuals - to go into group therapy.  The hope was that the members would be able to iron out some of the interpersonal problems that had arisen and been allowed to fester over the twenty some odd years of the group's existence.  It also happened to be a time in which the band was working on a brand new album, the first in over three years (it would come to be called \\"St. Anger,\\" when it was finally completed and released in 2003).  Thus, thanks to the presence of the ubiquitous but largely unobtrusive camera and microphone, we are given an up-close-and-personal glimpse into the dark underbelly of the creative process.  Actually, considering the fact that Metallica is now entering its third decade as a viable rock'n'roll band, we shouldn't be all that surprised that there is a great deal of stress and strife taking place behind the scenes.  The wonder is that there isn't even more of it, to tell you the truth!<br /><br />As is very often the case with human relationships, it is the people who are the most similar in terms of personality and temperament who wind up engaged in the greatest conflict.  Lars and James are both equally strong-willed, obstinate and obsessed with personal power, and, indeed, it is they who we see most commonly butting heads, while it is Kirk, more mild-mannered and less ego-driven by nature, who takes on the role of mediator-conciliator for the group.<br /><br />One of the focal points of the film is James' struggle with alcoholism, his time spent in rehab and recovery, and the effect all of that has on the group as a whole.  The movie also touches lightly on the history of the band, Elgin's running battle with Napster, and the group's search for a new bass player to replace the one who had just recently left.  But the movie always comes back to the therapy sessions, during the course of which old scores are settled, long standing wounds are opened up and cauterized, and a new sense of camaraderie and purpose settles over the group.<br /><br />Metallica's diehard groupies might have preferred it if the filmmakers had devoted a little less footage to the musicians gabbing and a little more to them playing, but the movie provides enough of a musical sampler to whet the appetite of non-fans without driving them screaming from the theater (or living room).rk, more mild-mannered and less ego-driven by nature, who takes on the role of mediator-conciliator for the group.   <br /> <br />One of the focal points of the film is James' struggle with alcoholism, his time spent in rehab and recovery, and the effect all of that has on the group as a whole.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Tight, blistering guitars and short bursts of angry lyrics reminiscent of \\"Sugar\\" but more political, insightful, powerful and robust.  THIS is the release we've been waiting for!  BYOB and Sad Statue are real standouts -- but there's not one filler on the ENTIRE album. Fans of nu metal and old, fans of thrash and punk and hardcore will love it.  A MUST HAVE for your collection.
B00005JNJT|5.0|When Batman first attempts one of his stunts in the truly remarkable Batman Begins, the thought flashed across my mind \\"He's going to hurt himself.\\" That's the level of immersion into the world of Bruce Wayne that this film is capable of.<br /><br />Sometimes titles really do indicate the subject matter of works, and this is one of those occasions. This is not the story of a man with a dual identity, like the first Batman, who has difficulty balancing roles that were thrust upon him by cruel fate. This is the story, first, of how a traumatized boy almost threw his life away in blind revenge, and, granted a reprieve, turned his back on his wealth to experience another world. (It is the story of Batman as American ninja, as cheesy and offputting as that might sound, the movie does it right.) This is not a Batman of chopsocky fights and kung-fu bad guys standing in a line for a chance to fight the hero. This is a Batman who lives veiled in shadows and who employs terror and misdirection as his weapons, not brute strength. This is the story of how Bruce Wayne forges himself into Batman and it is a powerful story, even for people far beyond the normal gravitional pull of the world of comics.<br /><br />I found a criticism here to be on point: asking the question Why did Bruce's parents exist through the side door instead of the front? (setting up their murder). A fair question, but not one that occured to me while watching the movie. And, a great number of such questions may occur to us after the end of this film, but I suggest that very few indeed will occur while we watch it.<br /><br />Another fair criticism is that the end is overblown. It is, it is, but that is partially the disappointment at having this film end.<br /><br />I must also note that this is a scary movie. I don't want to give more than that away, but it is a scary movie, in part because of the effective special effects and in part because it is so good at making its characters real, so that we truly feel their pain.<br /><br />Note about casting: The film is also exceptionally well cast, not only in the main roles, but in such minor parts as Bruce Wayne's father.<br /><br />A note about the direction: Sure, it's a far more conventional story than Memento and some Nolan fans may be bitterly disappointed for that reason, but if this is the conventional, it is the perfect execution of the conventional and that is really good enough.<br /><br />Note about vagueness in the review: I apologize for the vagueness in parts of the review, I didn't want to give too much of the movie away. The one spoiler there is discussed elsewhere in reviews here and should come as no surprise to anyone conversant with the Batman story. I hope you watch this movie, it really is good.sting: The film is also exceptionally well cast, not only in the main roles, but in such minor parts as Bruce Wayne's father.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Like with \\"A Rush Of Blood...\\", I'm really impressed. The songs are great, with new innovations in guitar riffs and piano sounds.  <br /> <br />The acoustic piano from the preceding album is less dominant and guitar takes a great place with a sound reminding \\"The Edge\\" from U2. However, don't be afraid, songwritig, both for lyrics and melody as well as for more sophisticated chord sequences, is very different from Bono's band.  <br /> <br />Great emotional feelings in the way music is played by the band. Chris Martin's voice performance is unique, better than other Coldplay albums. Innovative sound, great recording, nice songs,...long life to these unique musicians !
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Dude what happened? I just heard \\"Best Of You\\" on the radio and it's sounds terrible. Then I remembered Dave can't really sing or play guitar. He can scream and play power chords but thats about it.I remember hearing this Dj on a local radio station (who exaggerates alot) say how great this album was and how it made him cry. I mean c'mon, it's the Foo Fighters, not Nirvana. But then again, maybe it's because I don't really like the Foo Fighters. The only song I liked by them is \\"There Goes My Hero\\", but that's about it.What's with all these bands mellowing out?
B0009353IW|5.0|cooder at his best...glowing...if you like his stuff or even if you never heard it,you'd love this ...so much talent...all the musicans are groving and juliette is just great on a several cuts...a must have...the story line is special,as is the quality of the sound...
B000002KO1|5.0|So my friend and I were driving home from somewhere, generally happy music was going through a revolution. Suddenly, he switches to a station playing \\"Tattooed Love Boys\\". We couldn't believe the sound we were hearing! Seriously, he pulled his van over and we both sat there with our mouths agape, sometimes turning to each other in disbelief! We kept asking each other \\"who is this, who the f#@& is this\\"!? Maybe only three ocassions in my life have I been truly awestruck, and this was one. Of course we found out, each bought the album and hailed the glory days of rock returning. Alas, the Pretenders stand alone, this was not an omen of things to come. Crappy Punk and New Wave still littered the scene then died, then even crappier hair spandex metal came out and died. But we did (and thankfully still do) have The Pretenders!  <br />I am less inclined to dismiss C.H. and company's later work, for there's something great on all Pretenders' albums, and they are one of the few, true rock and roll bands (well, it's Chrissie's vision) out there. This is an essential CD to own. And the rest of the Pretender's output are well worth adding to your collection, too. It's real rock and roll.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This review is spoiler-free, <br /> <br />I have to admit that going into theaters, I had my doubts.  Christopher Nolan, the director, was primarily known for the exceedingly clever Memento.  A Batman movie would require this new director to flex muscles he hadn't yet displayed.  My worries were misplaced; the cleverness displayed in Memento translated well to Batman.  This is easily the best Batman movie yet. <br /> <br />The first two Batmans were well received and are loved by many.  The tone is unrelentingly dark for the most part.  These two never really did it for me....I could never buy Michael Keaton as Batman....he didn't seem large or menacing enough to wear the mantle of the Dark Knight. <br /> <br />The 3rd movie, Batman Forever, was a dramatic departure from the first two.  It featured a far more campy atmosphere.  Still, the cast handled the script well, and in my opinion, it worked reasonably well. <br /> <br />Batman and Robin was certainly the stinker of the group.  Clooney, Silverstone, and others tromped their way through a script that must have been difficult even for them to stomach.  Additional problems included moronic looking bat-vehicles and the reduction of Bane to \\"minor house pet\\". <br /> <br />Up until now, the Batman movies had failed to do several things: <br /> <br />1.  Put forth a really credible \\"man under the mask\\"- Kilmer got the closest (some say Keaton), but none were perfect. <br /> <br />2.  Find the balance between darkness and humor. <br /> <br />3.  Credibly explore the factors within Batman's dark psyche. <br /> <br /> <br />Batman Begins manages to accomplish all of the above.  The movie is dark, but tinges of humor are interlaced throughout. <br /> <br />Cast/Acting:  Batman Begins has a huge cast of A-list names.  Sometimes, movies so jam-packed with names fail miserably.  Surprisingly, the movie juggles all of the characters so well that none of them feel under-utilized.  Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, if more serious than I expected.  Gary Oldman looks the part of Gordon and as usual, handles his role with care.  Ken Watanabe and Cilian Murphy play very convincing villains...Murphy, in particular, is very fun to watch.  Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman are very welcome additions to the cast and provide some of the film's best moments.  The weakest link is Katie Holmes, who acts here just like she does in everything else.  Finally, Christian Bale is far and away the best man to don the Batman uniform.  He plays both Batman and Bruce so effortlessly that I hope he will get the opportunity to do so again. <br /> <br />Plot:  Superhero movies always have to walk the fine line of respecting the source material while making it accessible to audiences and conforming it to a cinematic format.  Sometimes this means making the material more politically correct; others times, important details are left out for money or time reasons.  I can't say I've read many of the Batman comics, but I'm very familiar with both Batman and his villains thanks to Batman: The Animated Series and other sources.  Batman Begins stays true to the Batman character while providing further depth than I've seen elsewhere.  The large cast accomodates a large number of relationships that define who both Bruce and Batman are.  The pacing is perfect, and the first part of the movie provides very believable background for exactly and practically how Batman became Batman.  Unlike other origin stories, this part of the movie manages to be every bit as enthralling as the rest.  The entire story simply feels so much more multi-layered than any of the previous Batman movies.  Batman Begins is both a character study and, in my opinion, a superhero epic.  The legend of Batman is handled carefully, with respect for long-time fans. <br /> <br />Music:  I'm a big fan of movie scores, and I wasn't dissappointed here.  I wasn't in the slightest bit surprised when, in the credits, I saw the names Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  Howard contributes the beautiful quiet themes while Zimmer contributes the powerful themes he's so well known for.  Together, the two composers take the pacing of an already fantastic movie to another level. <br /> <br />I hardly imagined that this movie would turn out as well as it did; I should have known that Director Chris Nolan would pull through.  I'm leaving some things unsaid because they are better experienced as a viewer.  In conclusion, I can only hope that the same forces that came together to create this movie will bring us a sequel.  Batman Begins and returns, indeed!
B0006L16N8|5.0|The first masterpiece of 2005 has arrived packaged with delicious hype and savory expectations. With \\"X&Y,\\" we finally get a full-course meal. And each course is served will all the trimmings. Nothing is left out this time. \\"Square One\\" opens the album and acts as a tempting appetizer. And like any good appetizer, this one leaves you wanting more. With lyrics like, \\"You're in control is there anywhere you want to go,\\" how you not press forward? Another review pointed out that \\"X&Y\\" asks some interesting questions and the next song \\"What If\\" is the perfect example. It's a very touching and moving song and it really gets to you when you hear the words, \\"What if you should decide/That you don't want me there by your side/That you don't want me there in your life.\\" It really makes you think about someone that's very close and dear to you.    Some have complained about the lyrics, but now that I've had an opportunity to examine them, I have to disagree with those complaining. The music kind of distracts you from the fact that there is really something substantial hidden underneath all the great music. I think they did a better job lyrically than people are really giving them credit for. And when you combine the two, the music and the lyrics, that's when it becomes powerful. It takes on a dream like quality. You get swept away by the composition in its entirety.     The whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts when it comes to \\"X&Y.\\" Each song does have the ability to stand alone as a single vignette, but when you play the album collectively it becomes even more striking. This album just feels more cohesive than AROBTTH. \\"X&Y\\" can be read as one article. That's why this really qualifies as a GREAT album. Everything fits together seamlessly.     But the ultimate reward from listening to Coldplay is that it makes you feel human. It's written on your level and there's a real attempt to make a connection with the person that is listening. The album has an epic feel, but it's done in a very accessible format. I think there's a great and beautiful mythology to Coldplay, to \\"X&Y.\\" There is a great power in myth, and Coldplay captures that essence perfectly.

B0000028RR|5.0|I've always been confused by the statement \\"anger is a gift\\" (a statement that Zach mutters in the album ender, \\"Freedom\\"). And even though I still don't fully understand it, I do know that without anger, there would be now Rage Against the Machine. So, anger is most definitely a gift.<br /><br />In many songs, RATM frontman Zach de la Rocha goes from mad to livid, and, over the course of this whole album, he goes from livid to insane. Zach rages throughout every minute of every one of these songs. He can't sing very well, but no rock-rapper can rap or yell as well as he. As Spin magazine says: \\"He (could) rap like Bob Dylan (could) sing: in a way that makes you hang onto every word.\\" Some wonder why Audioslave is almost alternative, since Zach and Co. were so heavy. I think I know the answer: because, with a singer like Zach de la Rocha, Rage Against the Machine could afford to be heavy.<br /><br />Guitarist Tom Morello, a true virtuoso, sounds equally as pissed. This album captures Tom in his prime; he shreds his fret board with preciseness, intensity, and (what sounds like) much ease. His chunky riffs, tasty solos, and all around crazy sounds show that there's almost nothing he can't do with his instrument.<br /><br />But sounding mad is pointless, unless you have something to be peeved about. The lyrics are very inspired, yet thought provoking and uplifting-encouraging the listener to take political action. Zach makes Rage Against the Machine  much more than just a loud rock band. Also thanks to Zach's words, 13 years after this album's release, it's still as powerful and relevant as it ever was. Make no mistake, Rage are activists; their words are often blatantly anti-American. But they mean well: they aren't against everything having to do with America. The songs are mainly about war, corruption in America, capitalism/poverty, racism, and censorship.<br /><br />This group was one of the first--if not THE first--bands of the 1990's with the guts to take on the government. But Rage's self-titled debut is both lyrically and musically revolutionary. Run-DMC and Aerosmith may have been the group that gave birth to rap-rock, but Rage (and Biohazard) are equally as responsible for creating rap-metal/rapcore. But this group, unlike most nu-metal, also combines funk into their intense rap-rock mesh.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Bombtrack\\" opens with Tom lightly picking at his fret board, then a smattering of drums kicks in, and the song jumps in volume. Tom changes his playing to stop-start riffs, Zach lets out a grunt (\\"Uh!\\"), then his patented (now famous) rapping begins (and runs throughout the whole song, except for the end when he lets out a yell.)<br />-Best lyric: \\"See through the news and views that twist reality.\\"<br />\\"Killing in the Name\\" is incredible. It features a galloping beat and the thumping choruses are super catchy. If you've only heard this song on the radio, you're missing out on the best part, because this song is most well known for the end: after a careening guitar solo, Zach lets out an repeating/ascending, spittle-flecked exclamation of \\"F--- you, I won't do what you tell me!\\" This one must be a concert favorite (with Zach getting noticeably more upset before becoming almost uncontrolled); I know it's a personal favorite.<br />-Best lyric: \\"Some of those that wear forces...are the same that burn crosses.\\"<br />Tracks three and four feature something that's very rarely found on an RATM record: melody. The former, \\"Take the Power Back,\\" has a slow, drawn out beginning, until Zach yells \\"Bring that s--- in!\\" This song has beeping guitars, more rapping, and another good guitar solo. So where does the melody come in? Well, it comes down around the 4:25 mark, with light drum tapping and distant guitar strumming. The song ends, however, with another grunt, and a shout-chant of \\"Take it back, ya'll!\\"<br />-Best lyric: \\"Motha f--- Uncle Sam!\\"<br />\\"Know Your Enemy\\" features a cameo by Tool frontmanMaynard James Keenan. The beeping, occasionally twangy sounding guitars kick into high gear with fast, propulsive riffing. Maynard lets out a Tool-esque yell of: \\"The time...has...come...to pay!\\" Following one of the choruses, there's another genius guitar solo. This one, which was completely unexpected, has several parts to it and lasts over 25 seconds. Another famous ending is included, part of which is a capella (Zach yelling: \\"All of which are American dreams!\\")<br />-Best lyric: \\"Word is born. Fight the war, f--- the norm!\\"<br />\\"Wake Up\\" is another personal favorite. Its rapping is so swift and catchy, it's probably the best song on here that showcases Zach's ability. This isn't a song you're going to see on an Eminem record, however. Even though, throughout most of the rap, Tom's making hip-hop sound effects, this song does have some instrument feedback and the choruses are instrumental. Plus, it ends with eight long, visceral yells of \\"Wake up!,\\" and another short but sweet solo.<br />-Best lyric: \\"You know they murdered X, and tried to blame it on Islam.\\"<br />\\"Freedom\\" is dedicated to Mumia Abu Jamal. The beginning has another grunt, making it sound like a punch in the gut. Even though Tom, Tim, and Brad make the instruments \\"swing like a wrecking ball,\\" this song was clearly written for Zach's vocals and lyrics to run wild. I enjoy how this song's choruses build, then pause, Zach has a spoken word part, then the song explodes again.<br />-Best lyric: \\"Anger is a gift.\\"<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine were the first group to introduce me to heavy rock. Thus, even though I have branched out to many different (and usually much heavier) metal bands, this band will always have a place in my heart. It brings back a lot of nostalgia when I listen to this album, and I think most other people will have similar results.<br /><br />To conclude, this is still a wonderful and powerful album, even after all this time. You'd be hard pressed to find an album that is more revolutionary, influential, original, genuinely intense, inspired, and inspirational. Remember, it's fine to enjoy this just for its music, since the musicianship is superb; but keep in mind there's more to this disc than what initially meets the ear. I'm not saying there's truth to all of Zach's lyrics, but I encourage you to read and think about them; then you can decide if they're true or not.rs kick into high gear with fast, propulsive riffing.

Another famous ending is included, part of which is a capella (Zach yelling: \\"All of which are American dreams!\\")  -Best lyric: \\"Word is born. Fight the war, f--- the norm!\\"  \\"Wake Up\\" is another personal favorite. Its rapping is so swift and catchy, it's probably the best song on here that showcases Zach's ability. This isn't a song you're going to see on an Eminem record, however. Even though, throughout most of the rap, Tom's making hip-hop sound effects, this song does have some instrument feedback and the choruses are instrumental. Plus, it ends with eight long, visceral yells of \\"Wake up!,\\" and another short but sweet solo.  -Best lyric: \\"You know they murdered X, and tried to blame it on Islam.\\"  \\"Freedom\\" is dedicated to Mumia Abu Jamal. The beginning has another grunt, making it sound like a punch in the gut. Even though Tom, Tim, and Brad make the instruments \\"swing like a wrecking ball,\\" this song was clearly written for Zach's vocals and lyrics to run wild. I enjoy how this song's choruses build, then pause, Zach has a spoken word part, then the song explodes again.  -Best lyric: \\"Anger is a gift.\\"    Rage Against the Machine were the first group to introduce me to heavy rock. Thus, even though I have branched out to many different (and usually much heavier) metal bands, this band will always have a place in my heart. It brings back a lot of nostalgia when I listen to this album, and I think most other people will have similar results.    To conclude, this is still a wonderful and powerful album, even after all this time. You'd be hard pressed to find an album that is more revolutionary, influential, original, genuinely intense, inspired, and inspirational. Remember, it'sfine to enjoy this just for its music, since the musicianship is superb; but keep in mind there's more to this disc than what initially meets the ear. I'm not saying there's truth to all of Zach's lyrics, but I encourage you to read and think about them; then you can decide if they're true or not.
B00029LNHS|5.0|I remember Black Eyed Peas when they were handing out their CD's at the Weenie Roast some years back with Eminem just coming out with \\"My name is...\\"..it took them several years but they made it, along with bad ass Fergie. Her voice gives me chills. Their songs are definitely catchy earworms but it's got so much funk and great beats, and an amazing voice by Fergie. She really makes the album, and don't let me get started on \\"Fly away\\" oooh! she kills that song. I really wish she sang that song at the concert...there were so many good songs on their album that they didn't perform, I didn't want to hear a Maroon 5 song? (even though I still like his music) <br />I think everyone compliments the group, her career is just starting no use in going solo. I just bought their \\"Monkey Business\\" album...and it blew me away. Another good song is \\"watch me\\" on their very first album (old school beat..love it!) Truthfully I would rather hear funky feel good songs where I could roll back the sunroof to over 50 Cent songs talking about all his bia*tches, cash flow, and guns. That gets played out! So don't listen to all the bad reviews! Keep it coming BEP...
B00005JNJT|5.0|hi, I will not go on like all the others.  BATMAN BEGINS is fantastic.  detailed background-story, romance, action and very good special effects.  forget all the other BATMAN movies-via TIM BURTON and JOEL SCHUMACHER-they have nothing on this movie.  a wonderful director CHRISTOPHER NOLAN should get high praise for his vision and version.  he made movies like FOLLOWING, MEMEMTO and INSOMINIA-people who love movies should take note and follow his career.  a star!, finally is the wonderful actor CHRISTIAN BALE--he has many movies to his credit but this will make him a star.  go see this movie-you WILL be disappointed if you do not.  my personal HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.  this will be one of the years best movies---I promise.
B000022TSW|5.0|i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen 32 times in a row. i have heard many people say that this movie is bad for children and it is but it is so much more than foul language and violence. it teaches life lessons and shows how if we stop worrying aboot the little things we will actually get the important things done like stopping wars and things like that. while teaching these wonderful lessons we get to laugh our hind quarters off with catchy songs like blame canada and uncle f*cker. in this movie you will probably laugh and laugh so hard you will cry but you will also learn some long lasting life lessions. <br />the makers Parker and Stone are movie genious's
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I hope this trend continues. That would be the trend of rock artists actually taking care and writing music. Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters give us hope for a better musical future. This album is terrific. Disc 1 rocks as hard as any other Foo album, and Disc 2 shows off the acoustic wonder that we all knew the foos could acheieve. Stand outs include the lead off/title track \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"No Way Back\\", \\"Best Of You\\" and \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" from Disc 1, and from Disc 2, \\"Miracle\\" \\"Another Round\\", \\"Friend of A Friend\\" and \\"Virginia Moon\\". This album is definately worth it, and since the copy protection is not that much of a hassle, its a must buy for any rock fan,
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Gladiator is possibly the greatest action-adventure film of the past decade, and this is the movie that made Russel Crowe the superstar he is today (much like Top Gun launched Tom Cruise to superstardom). The action scenes and intense battle footage are some of the most heart-pounding moments you'll ever see on screen. Any guy who sees Gladiator will momentarily wish they could be Maximus.    The movie features a great plot, thrilling action-packing fighting, superb acting, great costumes and cinematography, and an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The snowy woods and forests of Germania and the sun-baked deserts of North Africa really stand out, adding a sense of realism and brutality to the storyline. The film's score is very fitting for soldiers who are heading off to battle. And who can forget that memorable bloodbath in the Colliseum where Maximus and colleagues face off against opposing Gladiators armed with horse-powered chariots and superior weaponry?    Critics of Gladiator invariably blast the film as nothing more than excessive machismo and violence. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is quite elaborate, with several sub-plots thrown in along the way (but I won't ruin the film for those who haven't seen it yet). The acting really takes this film to the next level, though. Maximus's stoic demeanor and iron-like will is portrayed perfectly by Crowe, who took home the Oscar for Best Actor in 2001 for his performance in Gladiator. Joaquin Phoenix gives a convincing performance as Commodus, a spoiled royal brat and megalomaniac concerned with his perception among the Roman public. Connie Nielsen is under-used in this film, but nevertheless gives a good performance as ceasar's daughter. The film momentarily hints at a past romantic affair between Lucilla and Maximus, but all we are left with is speculation. Just who is the father of little Lucius?    I won't ruin the plot, but the storyline follows General Maximus as he leads Rome to victory over a barbarianuprising in Germania. Following the death of ceasar and some unfortunate luck, Maximus finds himself sold into captivity to a slave master in North Africa who uses his property as gladiators because of the popularity of this spectacle. Maximus hacks and slashes his way to become the top gladiator in the Roman empire and soon finds himself heading back to Rome - ready to avenge an old score. Along the way, Maximus wins the loyalty and respect of his fellow gladiators and the Roman public; in the process he achieves an almost emperor-like status. This sets the stage for the film's climax.    This was the first Russell Crowe movie I ever saw, and I've been a Crowe fan ever since. Some actors were just born to star in musclebound, action-packed films - and Crowe is one such actor. With Stallone and Schwarzenegger both heading into their 60s, Crowe may be on the verge of becoming the top action actor in Hollywood. Of course, neither Sly nor Arnold ever had Crowe's acting ability, and Crowe never needed steroids to build his muscular physique.    I fully recommend Gladiator to any fan of the action-adventure genre. However, an important word of caution: If you are squemish when it comes to violence, some scenes may be hard to watch. There are several scenes of graphic combat in Gladiator, so be forewarned.    The DVD contains several nice extras. There are several deleted scenes, the most disturbing of which pertains to a group of Christian adults and children who are fed to lions inside the Colliseum. Ridley Scott provides commentary on both the film and the deleted scenes, and there is information on the production of the film and interviews with Crowe. There are audio options as well, allowing the viewer to choose between Dolby 5.0 and 2.0 Surround Sound channels. The picture quality is very good and vibrant, and when a subwoofer is added to your system, be prepared for a thrilling cinematic experience.    Some reviewers have criticized Gladiator for its historical inaccuracy. It should be pointed out that this film never claims to be a true story. However, the main characters are based off of historical figures from different eras of the Roman empire. Marcus Araelius was a real-life Roman caesar, as was Commodus (although they were NOT father and son). Maximus is a re-creation of the Roman General Narcissus, who actually did kill the real Commodus. Joaquin Phoenix's character, Commodus, hints at an incestuous lust for his sister - which mirrors the psychotic real-life Roman emperor Caligula, who had sexual affairs with each of his three sisters.    However, if viewers are really that concerned with real-life accuracy, they should be tuning into the History Channel rather than Gladiator. In the motion picture, it is its non-stop action, quality acting and directing, and entertainment value that push Gladiator over the top. You will not be disappointed.
B000002UQJ|5.0|When you hear the name Paul McCartney, the most common connection is The Beatles. McCartney has done his best during his solo career to make you think of great music when you hear his name, and he proves his point on Off The Ground. The album's opening and title track is that of a relaxing nature. It calms the listener and prepares you for the melodic festivity that is yet to come. As you just about settle in, calm and waiting for melodic ecstasy, \\"Looking For Changes\\" smacks you in the head with it's distorted guitar and animal activist statement, driven by McCartney's scratchy vocal which gives the song that extra edge. <br />It's this juxtaposition of melodies that delights the listener for the remainder of the album. There are many acoustic gems in \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\", \\"I owe It All To You\\" and \\"Winedark Open Sea\\". And to all those people who say this artist has lost his rockout ability, check out \\"Biker Like An Icon\\" and \\"Get Out Of My Way\\". If it's witty and poignant lyrics you look for, \\"Mistress and Maid\\" and Peace in The Neighborhood\\" are classic, \\"maid\\" telling the story of a fed up wife, and \\"Peace\\" showing us a vision of a harmonious planet. But as usual, it's the piano driven tracks that make up the album's best tracks. The hushed \\"Golden Earth Girl\\", the hard \\"The Lovers that never were\\" opens with loud, brash piano chords, and never lets go. And most of all, a cry for help \\"C'mon People\\" is possibly the best track. It starts out with Just Mr. McCartney and a piano and slowly builds from there to a triumphant statement for peace. The album is not yet done, as the playful \\"and remember to be......Cosmically Conscious\\" soon follows \\"C'mon People\\" after a few minutes of silence. <br />To all those of you out there who say that the Paul McCartney of the 1990s is no match for the McCartney of the 60's 70's and 80's, Take another look at \\"Off The Ground\\"
B0009PVZWI|3.0|One thing that I don't really like about this dual CD/DVD is the way to make it last long. It'll take extra + ultra care not to damage either side of the discs. Just in case of the scratches, I made copies of the CDs on my computer.  <br /> <br />Disc 1 - Full Gig - 4 stars <br />Full gig is always my favorite. Especially Taylor Hawkins is playing his funky drums. This is what I call rock out! <br />Couple of catchy songs. I still like \\"There's nothing left to lose\\" production better than the this and last album.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 - Acoustic? - 2 stars <br />Seriously I don't really like FF's acoustic performance. It's just too awkward like Dave said in some of his acoustic performance. There's no ear-opening song from what I listen. A little disappointing... <br /> <br />Overall this is a little pricy. I would say if I decide to get just the CD or dualdisc, I would just get the CD.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Vocals aside, this is a masterpiece.  It may not be as heavy as WTF, but it is good in its own way (think high speed Guns N Roses). <br />First, Shadows' vox arent horrible, they just aren't as good as before.  But if you listen STST, and his vocals aren't tremendous on there either. <br />Gates is IMO the 4th best guitarist ever, behind Holdsworth(godlike jazz musician), Mustaine(megadeth), and Hammett(u know this one).  Gates can do it all, from Slayer-esque shredding (Burn it Down) to acoustic freestyling (several intros).  Zacky's harmonized riffs complement Gates nicely, though they are probably a bit overused on this CD <br />The Rev's drumming is flawless.  Nothing more to say. <br />And finally, after 3 albums, Johnny Christ's bass work is heard.  Nothing spectacular, but it does not by any means bring down the album, and the intro to The Wicked End is a nice change. <br />Standouts: <br />MIA <br />Burn it Down <br />Strength of the World <br /> <br />Overall, this album is solid and after several listens, you will see that Shadows' vocals are more different than weak.  If you are a metal fan and truly need the WTF sound again, check out the album METAL CHURCH by the band Metal Church.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I'm not sure I'm listening to the same CD all the haters complain about as I personally find this to be one of their best works to date. <br />After DT received somewhat of mixed feedback on their previous album that featured the heaviest sound the band has ever created, they decided to include a ballad this time around.  And what is the complainer's response?  They hate it again.  And some of them even go as far as saying they want Kevin Moore back and the band should let Ruddess go. <br /> <br />The album is in fact brilliant. It has a perfect balance between slower and more aggressive tracks, perfect musicianship (as always) and beautiful vocals done by Labrie.  Yes, it is more keyboard driven this time, yet Petrucci makes up for it with his flawless melodic soloing that is out of this world.  <br /> <br />Regardless of whether the listener is a prog rock or a heavy metal fan, this disc must be heard to be appreciated, so just pick it up and give it a try.  I am sure that metalheads will dig 'Panic Attack' and prog rock fan will find his piece of heaven in the title track. <br /> <br />And yes, Ruddess isn't going anywhere.  DT has taken music to another level with this guy and he is there to stay.
B00005JMYI|1.0|Will Ferrell is great, but this was one of his worst projects by far! This movie was NOT FUNNY AT ALL!! I think I may have laughed ONCE through the whole thing.  I can't believe there are people out there that actually liked this pile of dung!  The storyline was brutal, the characters were extremely bad... I just don't get this film it's so stupid it's insane. This film was the biggest disappointment for me in my whole film watching career.
B000002MUN|5.0|Wow, I am once again shocked, dismayed, and ashamed of the review that Amazon provided for the album. George Harrison? Tom Petty's best work is behind him? That's laughable, if not ridiculous and insulting.<br /><br />Dude this album is incredible. I listen to it practically every Sunday. I'm a Petty fan but I only have 5 of his albums. This one is #1 or #2 of the five (if not #1 then it's behind Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Greast Hits). On this album Tom Petty masters mood and atmosphere. I'll grant the naysayers some accuracy and agree that not every track is a fantastic masterpiece. Never the less, the mood as a whole that the album sends you through is more than satisfactory. I think you can withstand some lesser tracks in the insterest of a powerful, emotional, deep mood, can't you? Or you can just skip them.<br /><br />Simply take a look at the A+ tracks on this album... You Wreck Me? Enchanting and passionate, presents a fragile teenage-like mindset that I completely identify with. ... You Don't Know How It Feels? Woah, one of Petty's best songs. Such a strong presence, great groove, and very excellent lyrical flare. It epitomizes the same lost state of mind as the classic Mary Jane's Last Dance. ... Time To Move On? Wow, great, it took a little while for this song to grow on me but the wonderful poingnant atmosphere created by the mellow/reflective music and the life-lorn lyrics make this a great song. ... Honey Bee? Hahaha, that's a great won. Such a totally sweet hardcore rock groove, can you dig it? On this whole album Petty is a master of matching lyrical content with musical sound, style, & affections (honestly something you don't usually see done so well). On Honey Bee he matches the hardcore youthful lustful groove with lyrics about an odd lusty love affair. ... Wildflowers? That's a good one too. A very kind and sweet rythm with kind and sweet lyrics about freedom and desire and it portrays a couple of good characters (the protagonist and the person who is being sung about). Tom Petty kind of sounds like he's as young as he's ever been on this album, at least in my opinion, since it expresses so much of the confusion and emotion that teenagers feel.<br /><br />I reccomend this album. I am a huge fan of 'mind set music' and this ranks among the absolute best in my collection in that regard. (Along with Nirvana, Neil Young, and maybe Bob Dylan...)person who is being sung about).

0679720200|5.0|A short read (one can read it in a couple of hours or less), this is a book that I encountered in the same way that perhaps millions of others did, as prescribed high school reading (in my case in the mid-1980's). I remember being moved by it as a teenager; I re-read it again this week and found it an even more resonant and disturbing read as an adult.     Because this is written from a first person perspective, the story engenders a level of sympathy for what is really an unsympathetic character; one who acts without forethought, passion, or regret. The central character, Meursault, is carried along by those around him, and seems to have an emotional void when it comes to his recently deceased mother, his loving girlfriend, and his own feelings. He eventually kills a man, and is charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to the guillotine. Despite that fact that the murder is not in dispute, the trial is prejudiced by character witnesses who provide information about Meursault that really has no bearing on his actions.     The novel left me feeling unsettled towards a man who seems not to act in a way, or believe in those things that society deems conventional (ie. to express grief, to fall before God begging forgiveness for his wrongful deeds, to express any kind of remorse). Society rejects him because of this, and that fact alone made me feel sympathetic to him. The prosecutor calls him a monster. This is no monster; certainly no serial killer.     The morality is murky here. That is why it is great fiction, and why it will continue to be pondered and discussed for years to come.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I bought the Batman Begins soundtrack and i am impressed... the music is very epic and dramatic. I would have to say that MOLOSSUS is the BEST track on the album... I already have listened to it while i worked out earlier today its fast pace pumps me up.. especially when I punched my heavy bag really fast!!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is a great CD. The production is fantastic and songs are clever and entertaining. This is the best effort from Robert Plant in years.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I avoided this movie until only recently: what a mistake as the Godfather series is one of the best cinema features of all time.  <br /> <br />While there is many themes in the film, I think the strongest is that of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) growing from a naive man-child into a ruthless businessman and head of a crime family. Pacino portrays this character and his trials and education in an incredibly convincing manner.  <br /> <br />This is the movie which defined cinema in the latter half of the 20th century and established Pacino, Brando, Caan, and Duvall as respected actors. Experience this for yourself.  <br /> <br />One of my favourite quotes: <br />Don Corleon: I'm a superstitious man, and if some unlucky accident should befall Michael - if he is to be shot in the head by a police officer, or be found hung dead in a jail cell... or if he should be struck by a bolt of lightning - then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room; and then I do not forgive. <br /> <br />Don't just rent this: buy this movie. No DVD collection is complete without the Godfather series.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette is absolutely amazing. Every song on this CD is an instant classic. This has been my favorite album for 10 years. I highly recommend the acousitc 10 year anniversary edition that just came out on June, 14, 2005. This edition is fantastic. This is just as good if not better than the original. She is not as angry and bitter as she was in the original. I recommend both editions for whatever mood you are in!
B00000AFWZ|2.0|The title of this box set might mislead someone into buying this thinking it will provide a good overview of the 60s psychedelic era. Actually it gives a decent picture of the GARAGE BANDS that existed during the era, but has very incomplete coverage of the pyschedelic music scene. I suggest listening to the Technicolor Web of Sound website to get a more realistic sample of 60s psychedelia. Of course, you will hear some of this box set's more psychedelic tunes there, but also alot more. (This box gives a good overview of the 60s psych/punk songs, so I'd recommend it to people who are seeking that, but keep in mind there's alot of garage rock mixed in.)
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Quality release.  And for those of you complaining about the copy protection - it's true - you really are boneheads.
B0001L3MI0|3.0|I remember watching this film the weekend it came out.  The film blew me away with its special effects.  I gave it 4 stars back then.  After viewing it on TV, I have to admit the film lost some of it's magic.  The storyline could have been much better in telling who these aliens were and where they come from.  The ending is open ended which was a bummer.  It's still entertaining enough to recommend.  Just don't take it seriously!
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I liked the film a lot.  I went along with Miyzaki's normal story theme.  There is one person trying keep the peace between different parties that want to kill everything and each other.  The film comes to its climatic point at the very end and good overcomes evil (in a general sense).   <br /> <br />Still not better than Princess Mononoke, but definitely a flick worth picking up. <br />
B000001FT0|5.0|On TALKING BACK TO THE NIGHT, Steve Winwood makes a strong statement about how happy life can be if you don't indulge in bad habits (e.g. drugs, caffeine, alcohol, food, tobacco, gambling). When this album came out, many thought it was the work of a recovering addict, but interviews with Winwood proved that not to be the case. Rather, he was commenting on how he had survived while many of his contemporaries had not. This album makes me contemplate how many kids I went to school with may end up in psychiatric centers for the rest of their lives, whereas I'm in my own apartment, and how, in May 1993, many of my classmates were in terrible shape, but a girl I was on a rec group trip with, who I'd gone to camp with, who was available (not already dating), thought I was attractive. Winwood's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
0679746048|4.0|Susanna Kaysen shares her very private journey into mental illness and the mental illness facilities in her biography, Girl Interrupted. It is not told in a linear fashion, which I can imagine would irritate some readers. Instead, the reader is shown snapshots of her experience, with a sprinkling of her actual medical records included to lend authenticity to Kaysen's story. In the end, the reader is left with the disturbing realization that Kaysen's illness, while real, could have been attributed to any teenager in just about any time period.
0385338082|4.0|Can You Keep a Secret? by Sophie Kinsella is a delightful, make you laugh out loud kind of novel. It is full of secrets and romantic sense. The story is about a woman named Emma who has many secrets that she keeps to herself. She finally finds a job she likes and after convincing her boss that she can do her job getting a new client to sign with there company, Panther Cola. She drops the ball at the last minute losing her client. On her way back from the U.K. she sits next to a man who she begins to talk to. During the plane ride back they hit some turbulence and Emma thinks she is going to die. She breaks down telling this man all those secrets she never wanted anyone to know. She later finds out that the man she was sitting next was no other then Jack Harper, the American CEO for Panther Cola. Her and Jack end up dating off and on.  I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read it. Its an English book, so it's a little hard to understand but its quit funny.
B00005QK3W|1.0|After barely getting through this entire CD (and thank god I was doing chores at the time so it wasn't a complete waste), I couldn't help but wonder if Paul still has the ability to critique his own work and compare it to milestones like Red Rose Speedway, Venus and Mars, and Band On the Run.  It tempts one to think he has abandoned his standards and only releases records out of habit now.  Let's put it another way:  This disc is only for the sycophantic rabid fan who worships every turd Mac lays.  Find it used, check it out at your public library, or avoid it altogether unless you're a neurotic completist rounding out your collection.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Without resorting to the hero worship of a number of critiques across the net, I would rather offer a more scholarly analysis of the successes & the failures of this outing by Dream Theater. I am a doctor of music student here in Chicago, IL and have listened to every album that Dream Theater has put out since When Day & Dream Unite as well as a number of their side projects (Liquid Tension, Neal Morse, and Transatlantic).<br /><br />Although this album lacks the excesses of virtuoso technical display, the descent into rock/ metal clich&eacute;s and simplistic song construction cheat the potential Dream theater has been falling short of their potential with hints of bands such as Yes, Rush, Kansas, King Crimson, et al.<br /><br />What was a strength in the last 3 albums, has become a weak compositional device to connect albums motivically (using previously used melodies & melodic/ rhythmic fragments). This is the largest problem with the opening song Root of All Evil with references to previous albums with half-hearted recycling of music and lyrics that are no longer all that original. With regards to instrumentation, the retro feel of the album by use of continuum & lap steel was the most reminiscent of the Yes Albums Close to the Edge.<br /><br />The element of the recording that is the most problematic, before the mildly overblown mix, is the lack of attention to orchestration. With previous attempts at using orchestra (which with the small numbers of strings, the orchestra sounds thin). Note from an orchestral musician, this is not even the numbers to constitute an orchestra (without double basses in the strings) to sound anything larger than a string octet at best. The writing for flute (too breathy and uninspired writing at best) and strings are non-idiomatic and simplistic sounding no different than a keyboard line that is all too often placed in a register/ range that it is muddy and almost in audible, and therefore redundant. Don't even think about the cheesy timpani (kettle drum) samples on the last album that are used incorrectly by Rudess! This is also a problem with Portnoy's Transatlantic Bridge Across Tomorrow in regards to the recording of strings, EQ-ing so much that it robs the instruments of their natural acoustic tone. Especially, the fact that the strings were probably recorded at a different time as the band causes a blatant pitch discrepancy between the band and the orchestra on the closing chord of the album!<br /><br />Although, the experiment of Octavarium was a worthwhile attempt by Dream Theater, hopefully, their attempts at more complex orchestration and collaborations with classical musicians will be more akin to the harmonically colorful lush writing of some of the recent Pain of Salvation albums (most notably The Perfect Element), not all perfect by any means. Hopefully these brief words will give the next to purchase the Octavarium album a chance to get a bit of perspective about the album.esy timpani (kettle drum) samples on the last album that are used incorrectly by Rudess!

B0007XT87G|4.0|I know there a lot of suckers out there like me that are interested in purchasing this album solely based on the fact that Steve Wilson produced Opeth's Blackwater Park (and beyond). If you are a hardcore metal head and wouldn't like Opeth without their heavy side then don't purchase this album. If on the other hand your a little bit more open minded then definitely check this out. <br /> <br />The songs on this album have a very slick feel about them. Each song is a distinct entity, each arousing interest with their own unique qualities. There is a little bit of loud riffing but mostly this is an album that uses the language of tone and mood rather than angular, quantifiable note assemblage.  <br /> <br />The most disappointing aspect of this album is that it gives you a teaser of what this band is possible of but does not deliver the ultimate experience. I suspect very strongly that some of their back catalogue may have a much tighter, focused construction and would be possibly worth a look. This album though tends to meander a little and i find myself thinking about my shopping list, or the booger i cant get out my nose half way through some of the songs.
B000002UB3|5.0|Hi.  This was my first Beatles album.  I am normally a fan of Metallica, Guns and Roses, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, so I never really thought that I would like the Beatles.  Well, I was suprised when I listened to this album.  It really is great.  Every song is genius.  I know this may not sound like much coming from a hard rock/metal fan, but what I am trying to say is that I think anybody can apprecitate this album, it really is a work of art!
B000957O82|4.0|Okay - I'm a guy who likes Will Smith in comedies and action films.  I love to share a good romantic comedy with the Mrs. but unfortunately WAY too many romantic comedies are not good.  I saw the ads for \\"Hitch\\" back when it came into the theatres and what I saw didn't make me want to see it.<br /><br />The Mrs. rented it last night, and we're both glad!  Will Smith plays the title character, a high-priced consultant who turns romantic, but unskilled men into objects of desire.  An opening montage shows hapless klutzes scoring with babes and we buy that \\"Hitch\\" must be good at his job.  Eva Mendez is the saucy Sara, a gossip columnist who is so busy and successful at her job that she hasn't thought about romance for years.  Kevin James meets Smith's comic chops every step along the way as the chubby bumbling accountant Albert who secretly pines for his high-profile client, zillionaire heiress Allegra Cole.<br /><br />For a movie like this to work, there has to be a generous and believable dose of \\"heart\\" and \\"Hitch\\" has it.  The central conflict in the movie comes from the perception about the mysterious \\"Date Doctor\\" Hitch.  The actual character has professional morals and ethics.  He doesn't train his clients to deceive their objets d'amour, he just \\"gives them opportunity\\".  We meet a jerk early in the film who hires Hitch to get tricks to bed women.  How Hitch sidesteps the guy is the right mixture of heart and machismo.  Wouldn't you know that \\"Mr. Wrong\\" later goes out with the best friend of Hitch's romance Sara?  Certainly it makes sense that Sara the gossip columnist would be tracking every move made by Paris Hilton surrogate Allegra.  It even makes sense to question why beautiful Allegra is being seen about town with dumpy Albert.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  But there were some honest belly laughs, and more thought than usual into the wittier than usual script.  The Mrs. and I give 2 thumbs up!
B00005JNJT|5.0|I have just returned from a midnight showing of Batman Begins, and my reaction is that of complete astonishment. Forget Tim Burton (and I won't even mention that other director), Christopher Nolan shows us what Batman should have been from the beginning of the series. It's too bad it took so long to get to this movie. <br /> <br />Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne ended up becoming the Dark Knight. We see his training, and learn what inspires him to fight for justice. Christian Bale is perfect casting, and is the best Batman to ever grace the screen. Michael Caine is a brilliant Alfred with a great sense of humor, Morgan Freeman is brilliant in his supporting role, Katie Holmes is great as Bruce's love interest, and Cillian Murphy is effectively creepy as the Scarecrow. <br /> <br />Batman fans, THIS is what you have been waiting to see. While I enjoyed the first two Batman movies of the original series, I felt that they were both lacking something. This Batman brings everything you wanted to see to the screen, and I will be first in line for the sequel.  <br /> <br />Thank you to Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer, Christian Bale, and all the rest of the cast and crew for bringing one of my favorite superheroes to life the way he should have been from the very beginning.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|this album is the best of both worlds for music lovers, especially foo fighters fans. the first disc is a passionate, loud, and sometimes rageful expression of deep feelings. <br />their first single is so well written, \\"the best of you\\". it's a song that is just so full of heartache that anyone can relate to those feelings. the foo fighters sound like they're really expanding and growing as a band. key tracks on disc one; \\"in your honor\\" \\"the best of you\\" and \\"the last song\\" don't get me wrong, i think all the songs are great, but those are the ones that stuck out right away for me. <br />now on to the more quiet disc 2. it's awesome and different, really melodic guitar, it's a disc that you can just listen to and get sucked into with the way the lyrics are just woven together into the music. key tracks on disc 2 are \\"what if i do\\" \\"over and out\\" \\"on the mend\\" and \\"razor\\". <br />this album can fit so many moods, i've only had it for a day and already i love it. it's the best of both worlds, loud expression and quiet introspection. i would recommend this album to almost anyone.
B00008RH3L|5.0|This is a GREAT flick, those who hate it are art-house fops...and will find fault with everything. It has been 15 years, and this flick is still a fav.
B0000931QA|5.0|Widely regarded as the band's masterpiece, \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" was a rather bold undertaking-- following in the footsteps of The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", Queensryche assembled a concept album about a disillusionment and revolution, with a healthy dose of tragic love in there for good measure.  Like Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", the greatest moments in Mindcrime are not when the narrative is served, but rather when the pieces take on a universal quality, when the protagonist is clearly someone whose shoes we have worn.  All of us have been disgusted with big business, all of us have loved and lost.  Admittedly, most of us don't end up as assassins for cult leaders, but noentheless, there's a resonance here that's hard to capture. <br /> <br />Musically, its really a culmination of what's come before-- \\"Rage For Order\\" clearly points the way to this one, but this time the progressive elements and the seemingly endless styles mesh much better with the base metal form the band works within.  Admittedly, parts of it do sound a bit dated (the title track being the best example), but there's a real timeless quality to much of the music here. <br /> <br />Highlights are numerous here, certainly the opus \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", ten minutes plus of orchestral rock with chanting choirs, moody guitars, and a passion filled duet vocal became singer Geoff Tate and guest Pamela Moore is pretty central, and there's quite a bit of powerful metal pieces (\\"Revolution Calling\\", \\"The Mission\\", \\"The Needle Lies\\") that exceed the quality of similar songs on past releases, but its odd little moments on the album that really shine-- \\"My Empty Room\\" foremost on this.  An odd melancholy song, haunted, horrifying, and totally bizarre and unprecedented in the band's material. <br /> <br />For the remaster, the sound is somewhat improved and is crisp and distinct.  The album is augmented (in my opinion to its detraction-- I prefer the album as a statement unto itself) by two live tracks, a great take of \\"The Mission\\" from 1990 and a rerecording of the rearrangement of \\"My Empty Room\\" the band played on the \\"Promised Land\\" tour in 1994.  The latter is definitely well worth having as it really is quite inventive and creative. <br /> <br />This is one of the masterpieces of the metal genre and cemented Queensryche's reputation.  While I personally find \\"Promised Land\\" to be a superior album (for reasons of personal taste), this is a superb record, a great place to begin exploring the band's catalog, and essential listening.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I thought this was an INCREDIBLE musical. A. Weber is a genius, absolute genius!!! In my oppinion, words cannot express the full splendor of this film. It was one of the most tragic movies I have ever seen. So, if you are ever in need of a movie to watch, ignore the critics who put it down. It is a real breathtaker!!!
B00009L1UP|4.0|Riding high on the creative wave of \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", Queensryche returned to the studio to put together \\"Empire\\", what would be their commercial breakthrough. <br /> <br />Unlike most commercial breakthroughs though, this one doesn't have that feel nor the accusations of sellout-- in fact, the band simply kept developing along the lines of their own idiom, but after the massive encompassing storyline on Mindcrime, this was an album of songs, loosely based around themes of society and relationships.  Musically, its similar in Mindcrime in that the metal backdrop has become largely a backdrop on which the menagerie of styles and sounds can be overlaid.  As a whole, its a bit lighter in tone than Mindcrime was. <br /> <br />The strength of this album lies in its variety, there's great compulsive rock pieces on here (\\"Best I Can\\", \\"Jet City Woman\\"), some superb Queensryche styled metal (the title track), a few really breathtaking ballads (the album's hit, \\"Silent Lucidity\\", a piece deserving all the accolades it gets, homelessness ballad \\"Della Brown\\"), and at least one purely ecstatic love song with some great riffing (\\"One and Only\\").  As if that wasn't enough, album closer \\"Anybody Listening?\\" is in many ways the summation of the band's entire catalog (and history) and is one of the best they've ever done.  Admittedly the album has its weak moments (\\"Resistence\\" is a step backwards and \\"Hand on Heart\\" is just awful), but its really quite an effort. <br /> <br />The remaster, again featuring crisp, clean sound as the rest of the series, is augmented by three bonus tracks-- the goofy \\"Last Time in Paris\\" is a lot of fun but admittedly a throwaway and \\"Dirty Lil Secret\\" was a b-side for good reason, but their cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Scarborough Fair\\" is fantastic-- haunting, dark, and powerful. <br /> <br />This may not be the best thing Queensryche has ever done, but its awfully good, and its a great place to start with the band.  Recommended.
0141439475|5.0|I am one among the very few who has never watched a Frankenstein movie, but yet is very familiar with the name Frankenstein. Yet, it's highly ironic that popular culture (in film, television,etc.)has ironically came to confuse the name \\"Frankstein\\" with the Monster rather than the creator. This is one of the greatest attributes that has made Mary Shelly a genius of gothic and horror literature: uncertainty. She somewhat forces us to interpret the plot and the characters. For instance, who is really the monster, its creator or the monster itself? And most hauntingly, even more so to this day, where does science draw the line when it comes to the point that technology is playing the role of God? Even throughout the plot we aren't truly sure or convinced that any of the characters have grown wiser, or just sadder, if they learned anything at all. Is the monster a genius? Is he a murder, the \\"fallen angel,\\" a representation of a neglected Adam? Or simply just a child of innocence that was neglected and somewhat forced into a life of melancholy, despair, and adversity? Even after Mary Shelly had revised Frankstein, she has never changed the story. Her haunting novel still awakens us to think about the knowledge and imagination of man, and its limits, and how dangerous it can become if we start trying to become a substitute of God, or the \\"modern Prometheus.\\" I feel lucky that i have read this book before actually watching the Frankstein films, which i look foreward to seeing. But i know that the film doesn't follow Mary Shelly's novel exactly, however, it's a classic moment in pop culture. That has good points and negative points: first of all, regardless if people have read it or not, it opens us to a tale that still brings chills and suspense, and exemplifies the genius of the incredible author that made all of it possible. The sad thing is that people who have NOT read the book at all, and assume that they KNOW the story just from watching the classic Frankstein films, are truly missing out on a story that should be read, not just watched. I believe that people should learn this tale from literature first before pop culture. But from the looks of it, i guess it's easier to simply watch the film and be contented at that, which is fine. But hopefully, more people will be interested in knowing the true Frankstein who wasn't just some mumbling, grotesque creature, but one who was intelligent, articulate, an adept orator, and hauntingly just as human (and monstrous) as man itself., are truly missing out on a story that should be read, not just watched.

B000007MVM|5.0|This album is not for the uninitiated.  It is refreshingly real and brutally honest.  Syd Barrett exposes his soul for all to hear, for better or for worse.  I cherish this album and consider it a holy relic of recorded music.  Many of the reviews for this work cite the term \\"acid casualty\\".  I think Mr. Barrett gets a bum rap on that account.  I never read reviews for Hendrix albums that focus on his drug use or lingering effects of.  I never read reviews of early Stones albums that focus on Keith's nasty affair with heroin.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Before going into this, I do consider myself to be a very big Coldplay fan.  I bought the first 2 cd's right when they came out, and practically wore holes thru them by listening to them so much.  Needless to say, when I heard that X&Y was in the making, I was very excited, and very expectant... that this was going to be an awesome record, was a given.. i thought. <br /> <br />Coldplay is comprised of great musicians, that's a given.  Chris Martin is stupidly talented, no doubt about it.  But with X&Y I think Coldplay has missed the mark here, by trying way too hard to follow up A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  Each one of these songs have an outer shell that makes them appear to be worthy of being on another \\"Rush\\" album.  But the more and more you listen to this cd, you can't help asking yourself, \\"didn't I just listen to this song?\\"  For all of you out there who have the \\"Rush of Blood\\" cd, and have heard the many b-sides off that album, ie: Crest of Waves, I Ran Away, etc., Coldplay has all of a sudden fallen into a serious rut here.  Those songs were great when I first heard them.  But all their songs since sound the exact same. <br /> <br />There are some standouts on this record, namely, Square One, Talk, and Speed of Sound.  I have heard many people gushing over the \\"Fix You\\" song, and Chris Martin even said on MTV it's his favourite.  All I can say is, before he worries about fixing somebody, he should fix this song.  It's terrible.  I used to love this guys voice, falsetto, but this is too much.  The lyrics are completely lame, and if he wrote this for his wife, he should have left it at that... I think it sounds awful. <br /> <br />One thing I am very pleased with on this album is the closer, 'Til Kingdom Come.  This is an awesome, and very moving track, written by the late, great Johnny Cash.  Well done.. <br /> <br />To anyone thinking this is Coldplay's best stuff, think again.  Coldplay has moved into U2 territory, which is writing mediocre, radio friendly ballads... boring! <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I would really have liked to write a review about the music on this CD, but it will not play in my computer or CD player. <br /> <br />If the music industry keeps punishing their paying customers like this, there won't be any left.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Thinking about it now, I consider myself to be very lucky. I was a member of an entire generation whose first introduction to Batman was Tim Burton's stylistic 1989 film. The only Batman I knew when growing up was Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" and in the weekday afternoon cartoon, \\"Batman: The Animated Series.\\" Not a bad place to start, almost a bit spoiled, perhaps. <br /> <br />Taking this introduction to Batman into account, I believe that's why so many of us felt betrayed by Joel Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever\\" and especially by \\"Batman & Robin.\\" With these two movies, Batman suddenly became corny, a joke, and had lost his edge. Many older than my generation understood it was a throwback to the '60s, but for me and everyone else that grew up on Batman from the late '80s and early '90s, it was sacrilege. <br /> <br />However, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to announced that the Bat-nipples are gone and, at long last, we have the best on-screen incarnation of Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight. I suppose I could go all nit-picky and nerdy and get into those phrases like \\"it didn't happen that way in the comics, mwwaahh!,\\" but that's not my style. Just as Tim Burton's take on Batman was not 100% true to original creator Bob Kane, Christopher Nolan's is not either. After all, where would the fun be in a word-for-word, shot-for-shot big screen adaptation without a little personal vision? <br /> <br />Nowadays, getting a little older and a little wiser, I have become even more scrutinizing with how I spend my free time and which movies I drop $8.00+ bucks on. For me, the summer movie event was not Star Wars, it was Batman. And it was the first movie in a long time that I went out of my way to see at midnight on opening day. And in my not-always humble opinion, it was worth it, from start to finish. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" gives us the best movie version origins of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Taking into account the success Marvel Comics has hadas of late with their big screen adaptations, including top-notch casting and infusing characters with more humanity, \\"Batman Begins\\" incorporates both and uses them to perfection. In no other Batman film have we received such a clear understanding of Bruce Wayne's suffering, his anguish, and excellent divide between the mask he wears and who he really is: Batman. <br /> <br />Tim Burton's films were fantastic in their visual style and sense of adventure, but what lacked in my opinion was a clear understanding and compassion to our hero's cause. In \\"Batman Begins,\\" it's more than just good guy versus bad guy; there's genuine conflict between the life Wayne wants and the Batman he needs to be. <br /> <br />We are given a terrific tale of how Batman came to be. I enjoyed it because it gave us the intelligent, methodical, and brooding Batman who is the servant of justice, instead of the 'ka-pow,' wise-cracking cartoon. <br /> <br />The casting is outstanding. In my opinion, Christian Bale is the best Batman, even though many of you will undoubtedly disagree. My reasoning is not just because he carries off the suit, but because he also gives life to Bruce Wayne, showing the conflict in carrying on between the two. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Ken Watanabe, and Liam Neeson: well done. And, yes, even Joey Potter herself, Katie Holmes, was very good. <br /> <br />This, without giving too much away, leads me to another point. The subplots of Bruce Wayne's love life have always been more of a distraction for me than a positive. The only previous Batman film to not play up the damsel in distress role was \\"Batman Returns,\\" but that was because she also happened to be criminally insane. Fortunately, Holmes' \\"Rachel Dawes\\" doesn't fall into the abyss of hapless on-screen females. <br /> <br />This is the first movie in a long time that I will probably go back to see a second time in the theater. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and Ican't wait for Batman's return.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I bought this album on the day it came out and I wasn't sure if it would live up to the excellence that Dave Grohl said it would.<br /><br />It did.<br /><br />The first CD is loaded with catchy rock riffs that are complimented by Dave's voice, which he really made shine the entire album. There are only a few songs that sound just decent, but I have not found any so boring or mediocre that I would skip over them. I can listen to this CD straight through with no problem. The standouts are \\"Best Of You\\", \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"DOA\\", and \\"No Way Back\\".<br /><br />The second CD is my personal favorite. It's all acoustic. The mellow sounds and beautiful lyrics go perfectly with Dave's voice and the rest of the band. The songs are really \\"chill\\" music, and his voice really impressed me as I listened. Every single song on this 2nd CD is a standout in my opinion, with the exception of \\"Another Round\\", which did not appeal to me. My personal favorites are \\"What If I do?\\", \\"On The Mend\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\" (with Norah Jones on piano and backup vocals), \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", and \\"Razor\\".<br /><br />Listen... this is the best CD that's been out in a long time. It's the first CD that I've bought in years because it was worth it to me since I heard how awesome it was going to be. It IS that awesome! This entire set made me drool, and if you are a Foo Fighters fan, or maybe a fan of other rock groups like Pearl Jam or what have you...you will really enjoy this CD. It's a great mix of good rock songs to jam to and great acoustic songs to relax to.<br /><br />Having said that, yes the copy protection on the CD was a pain for me. I had to do a lot of running around and I eventually got it on iTunes and my iPod, but it was most definitely troublesome and it will make me hesitant to by copy protected CDs in the future. This CD is well worth the hassle.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Just to add my two cents, I agree with the criticism of so many regarding the over-use of the shakey handi-cam.  It was especially disconcerting in the theatre with the wildly cut chase at the end.  The DVD is somewhat more comprehensible.    That aside, I give the film high marks for an interesting story in a tight script that deepens the Jason Bourne story a bit more and for the fast pace that held my interest throughout.  The movie didn't drag and made its points quickly and persuasively.    Furthermore, I like the film a great deal because of Matt Damon, who is fully inhabiting the character of Jason Bourne, the superbly trained and ruthlessly efficient assassin.  Looking very fit and every inch a guy that could go on auto-pilot while he kicks your ay, Damon conveys the dual nature of a man that is troubled by his lethal past and yet is fully capable of employing his skills when necessary.    While everyone fusses around about the next James Bond, I couldn't help but think this movie Jason Bourne is a lot closer to Ian Fleming's coldly able agent with the license to kill.      In short, I hope we haven't seen the last of Damon as Bourne.  I liked the characters played by Karen Allen and Julia Stiles and wouldn't mind seeing them in future outings as well.    And, finally, in the next one, whoever directs please note that the camera can jump around sometimes, just not ALL the time.
0975991477|5.0|The key to reading this book is to open your thinking and allow yourself to consider the concepts presented. Throughout history when ideas radically different from the accepted norm have been presented, the ideas as well as the presenters were often laughed at and condemned. Only later, with additional research, many radical ideas are now accepted as norm such as the earth revolving around the sun, the earth being round, electric lights, telephone, TV, need I go on? <br /> <br />Dr. Lipton's book is presenting what today appears to be radical and completely against widely accepted facts. Yet, what establishes those facts? Repetitive messages, assumptions, even scientific studies following the same protocol as previously defined.  <br /> <br />Our mindset about what is true or false is influenced by our previous experiences and what we have accepted as facts. Sure Dr. Lipton is outside the traditional and that is good. If we consistently think and act the same, there is no growth. It is through exploration and radical thinking that the next generation of \\"known facts\\" gets established. <br /> <br />I congratulate Dr. Lipton for taking the risk to present his viewpoint on the controversial issue of how much control we have over our lives. I am thrilled to know that I have much more control than historical traditions would indicate.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I was so thrilled that Christian Bale was cast as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this prequel, because he's such a great actor, and he's work in The Machinist was amazing. I think he's portrayal of Batman is more impressive than the previous actors'. He's very attractive as Bruce Wayne, and he's so captivating as Batman. He deserves extra credit for being a British actor playing an American superhero, and he had to regain more than 50 lbs of lean muscles for the role right after he finished The Machinist.<br /><br />In this movie, we get to see the Bruce Wayne having flashbacks of the killing of his parents in the alley when he was a kid. His father Dr. Thomas Wayne is played by another British actor named Linus Roache(Wings of The Dove), who is perfectly cast for the role, especially he looks similar to Bale. The man who killed his parents never got convicted, and years later, it was upto Wayne to take justice into his own hands, despite the lack of support from his friend Rachel Dawes(Katie Holmes), who was a D.A. assistant to her corrupted boss Carmine Falcone(brilliantly played by Tom Wilkinson). Bruce Wayne abandoned Gotham City and embarked on a journey in Asia.<br /><br />He eventually met his mentor, Henry Ducard(Liam Neeson) and the ninja warriors that formed The League of The Shadows, whose mission was to wipe out the corrupted Gothem City. Liam Neeson looks rather unattractive in a wierd beard, and he's probably the most outstanding supporting player in this film. When he completed his training, he headed back to the Gotham City seven years later.<br /><br />With the help of his housekeeper Alfred Pennyworth(Michael Caine), and Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman), who was a weapon specialist, Wayne was able to transform into full Batman gear for the first time. He teamed up with Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman in a rather lowkey role) to battle the evil forces including The ScareCrow/Dr. Johnathan Crane(Cillian Murphy) who conspired to spread massive \\"fear hullucination chemicals\\" to destroy mankind. Wayne eventually reunited with Rachel when she was in danger and rescued her from the toxic chemicals. Just when he thought he had defeated all the bad guys, Ducard and the Ninjas arrived at his birthday party.....<br /><br />The sets are very elaborate, both the structure of the Gothem City and the remote landscapes were quite an eye candy. The fight scenes were great, especially the car chase scene when the Batmobile was crossing over rooftops. The cast is irresistable, but there is not enough screentime shared between Rachel and Bruce to allow them to develop enought romantic momentum. Overall, this movie is very entertaining, and it's the first time to see so much of Bruce Wayne that isn't depicted in previous Batman movies. I do hope it's going to be a blockbuster, so that they would get Christian Bale to play Batman again.n chemicals\\" to destroy mankind.

I refer to it as his \\"big band\\" album, partially because of the size of the band he's using here (at least 8 and at most 20 members), but also because of its strong jazz leanings.  Of all of the recordings that I own of Zappa's this is the one that feels the most like a jazz recording.  All of the songs besides For Calvin are instrumental and feature extended brass and woodwind solos.<br /><br /> Despite its instrumental nature, The Grand Wazoo can be viewed as a concept album.  The liner notes tell a story of Uncle Meat's creation of an illusory replica of Rome.  This replica is ruled by Cleetus Awreetus-Awrightus (which is a conceptual continuity phrase), and has a complex but entertaining mythology based entirely on music.  Non-musical people (called Questions) are rounded up and put out of their misery, but only after several chances at redemption.  His army consists of musicians, and their battles with Cleetus' arch-nemesis Mediocrates (whose army is heavy on vocals) are fought on a sonic battleground, playing shuffles to drown out their barrage of Ditties.  His staff includes Gregarious the drummer and Erroneous the bass player.  To reinforce this mythology, Erroneous is credited with playing bass on the Grand Wazoo, although Erroneous' actual identity is shrouded in mystery.  The instrumental sections conjure visions of the goings-on of these people.<br /><br /> The melodic material bears his unmistakable angularity, and there is lots of noise that Zappa must have conducted in the studio.  Perhaps it is because of period equipment, but I really dig Zappa's playing here.  His tone reminds me very much of David Gilmour's, but Zappa's chops leave Gilmour's in the dust (and I love Gilmour's playing).  I've also always thought that Blessed Relief was one of the best modal jazz standards you never heard in your life.<br /><br />The Lowdown: This is not a recording for the Zappa inductee.  However, on the off chance that you dig this recording as your first listen, you might have a very compelling view of Zappa's musical conception.  Regardless, it's worth checking out - maybe even worth studying!g this recording as your first listen, you might have a very compelling view of Zappa's musical conception.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Watching the Coldplay: Live 2003 DVD has me questioning critics who said this band was for \\"moony high school girls.\\" Do these critics understand the appeal of a band connecting with the heart of an audience or understand what \\"women\\" want to hear?<br /><br />\\"Let me in, unlock the door.<br />I've never felt this way before.\\"<br /><br />'Til Kingdom Come - the lyrics are insightful and emotionally honest. The poetry in the songs is comforting so you can relax and just enjoy the way the lyrics wash over your soul.<br /><br />\\"Hold my hand inside your hands,<br />I need someone who understands.<br />I need someone, someone who hears,<br />For you, I've waited all these years.\\"<br /><br />\\"And say you'll come, and set me free,<br />Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me.\\"<br /><br />I've rarely seen a band play with more passion and I was literally speechless after watching the concert, not to mention getting shivers more times that I can count. Their appeal is definitely their passion, the intense feelings in the music and the soul connection. At times Coldplay does seem to be channeling Sting, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Freedy Johnston, U2 and elements of Kraftwerk. I've even heard Nick Drake in Chris' voice when he is more mellow and dreamy like in \\"I bloom blaum.\\" I like hearing the variety of ways he can sing, he takes on all levels and challenges.<br /><br />After watching this band live, I came back to this album and I am going to say that while I'd rather hear them play in a concert setting, the music on this album has new elements of magic to intoxicate the senses. The energy is completely different and while Chris Martin owns the stage, here he owns the heart.<br /><br />The beginning of \\"White Shadows\\" blew me away the first time I heard it and the lyrics are complex and mysterious within the rush of sounds. I love the way \\"Talk\\" begins and concludes with an outer space shimmer of sound (reminiscent of the ethereal sounds in A Rush of Blood to the Head - Live 2003) and the entire song seems to break into an ecstatic swirl of sexy chaos that fuses danger with creativity.<br /><br />In \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" Chris Martin is almost intoxicated by intonation as he says: \\"you belong to me.\\" This entire album is dreamy and exciting in a romantic way.<br /><br />The tension and release in all the songs is emotionally satisfying. At times you are almost consciously awaiting the release into the musical ecstasy of a daydream or nostalgic escape. \\"Low\\" has some very edgy moments and Chris Martin expresses more of his instinctive creativity and energy that he shows on stage.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br />Patiently waiting for the next concert recordingf sexy chaos that fuses danger with creativity.

B0009IW88A|5.0|I've seen all the Batman Movies since they started and I have to say that the music scores were very good for the styles of the earlier Batman films. However the visual style of \\"Batman Begins\\" requires a deeper more dramatic approach to convey the true essence of what this movie projects. Hard, gritty and dark. I was very suprised when I found that Hans Zimmer was involved, and I must say....a perfect choice. He is one of my favorite modern movie music composers. His work in \\"Gladiator\\" was astonishing, to say the least. His style of music fits this movie to the tee. I would only hope that for the future Batman movies, Zimmer is chosen to do them all, as John Barry was to the early James Bond flicks. It would create an excellent continuity of film and music.
B00000I8BX|5.0|When I first heard of Fear Factory it was from my mom's boyfriend, and he let me borrow this cd. When I heard the first track I was blown away. This is one of those cd's that people search for in stacks of cds just so they can hear something awesome that hasn't been corrupted with the radio yet. Even thoigh a couple of the songs on this cd were on the radio, the radio actually promoted a good cd this time. Obsolete in my words is one of the best cds I have ever listened to. They have everything from heavy as heck bass driven tunes (hee... tunes) to the lighter songs that so many bands try and make, but very few succeed. And for the bonus Tracks? All of them are very diverse and sound great (my favorite is 0-0) with the exception of soulwound, which I think is the worst song on this cd but apparently people love it. If you like this genre of music then this cd is a definent must get but if your new to this type of music then listen to them a bit before buying this cd. You won't be disappointed by this cd.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is one great album.  Speed of Sound and Fix You are the best songs on the album hands down.  Low and X&Y are second.  A fantastic album once again from Coldplay
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is the best record by DT since \\"Metropolis\\". The rythm section is simply outstanding ...

Do not hesitate and got it.
0553802534|1.0|but I hated this book.  I always look forward to a Lisa Gardner book, but this one was a great disappointment.  First off, I hated the heroine Catherine (if that's what you can call her).  I realize she had a traumatic experience as a child, but she grew up to be an unlikeable woman.  She manipulates, cheats, sets up an innocent police officer and is very unapologetic about it.  The whole book overall is depressing.  You like to see a little bit of hope or happiness in a novel, but this has none of that.  The police officer is suspended, oh, and he also had an abusive childhood, and don't forget he's an alcoholic, oh, and let's not forget her childhood tragedy, and her postpartum depression, and how she was willing to just hand off her kid to a nanny, oh, and her kid is sick and her husband is abusive and her in-laws are awful...I could go on and on.  I did like the hero Bobby, and I did have hope that he would end up happy, and he kind of did, except he walked away from the woman he loved and never went back.  Great.  And the tragedy continues.  The story ends with the police still trying to get Catherine.  I actually skipped parts of the book because I thought it just all seemed so unreal.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did.  I like heart-wrenching stories, but I just didn't care enough about the characters to shed a single tear.  I'm hoping her next novel isn't this bad.

1594200440|2.0|A Short History of Tractors has gotten a lot of positive press, so readers of this review might want to take a look at those reviews as well, but to be honest, I can't figure out just what in the novel garnered such praise.  The main story is the reconciliation of two feuding sisters that comes as they must ally themselves to try and stop their 84-yr-old Ukrainian father from marrying Valentina, a 36-yr-old Ukranian who needs a husband in order to stay in England and live the Western lifestyle she so desires.  As the comical hijinks ensue, more serious issues are slowly revealed with regard to the family history.    There are some funny moments in the book,  but they were overshadowed by the book's weaknesses.  The plot is relatively banal--an old man lusts  after  the big-breasted gold-digger younger wife.  And while both Nicholai and Valentina are offered some dignified moments (Nicholai through his engineering intelligence and his obvious loneliness, Valentina through some moments of empathy as felt  by the narrator), the moments are rare so each tends to be more caricature than character.  The two sisters, Vera and Nadezdha, have been feuding since their mother died a few years earlier and Vera convinced her mother to add a codicil to the will benefiting her daughters.  While neither is as broadly drawn as Nicholai or Valentina, neither do they come across as fully fleshed out characters.  Revealed through short conversations, briefly described actions, or in the case of Nadezdha internal monologue (she narrates the story), their personalities are mostly glossed over and have a constructed-for-the-sake-of-plot feel to them. Little of their self-described emotion feels sincere.  Side characters are even less fully drawn.     The main plot--marriage and subsequent attempts at divorce or deportment-- has a predictable movement and conclusion and its many steps toward that inevitable conclusion start to feel repetitive early on.    The secondary plot, the sisters' reconciliation and the revelation of a darker family history is also relatively predictable and while more sad, really almost as banal. We know the family went through the Stalin years in the Ukraine; it therefore isn't all that surprising to learn there was some tragedy, some sacrifice, some deprivation, etc. that came along with it.  More surprising, and not particularly plausible, is that Nadezdha seems surprised by it.    Besides problems of plot and character, the book had some stylistic annoyances.  There were too many parenthetical expressions (most of them unnecessary, adding to the book's sense of obviousness), too many cute names (Big Sis, War Baby, Mrs. Flog 'Em . . ) too often repeated, too many lists, and so on.  The history of tractors book-within-a-book never felt integrated into the novel and so came across as more a gimmicky way to add some seriousness or weight to an otherwise light novel.     As mentioned, there were some funny moments, at times the book has a breezy feel to it, but overall it was quite disappointing, feeling more like a concept that would have worked great as a long short story mixing comedy and drama but failed in most aspects as a novel. Not recommended.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I was so excited for the new Coldlay album to come out and when I bought I was very disappointed.  A Rush of Blood to The Head was intense, emotional and deep and I don't get any of that from X&Y.  I expected it to be better than A Rush of Blood to The Head but I'm disappointed to say that, in my opinion, it is not.  The music is very good and it is a different sound for Coldplay but the lyrics sound like they were put together without any thought.  They seem shallow to me and like they were put together just so they could get an album out.  I would have to say that my favorite songs on the cd are Talk and White Shadows only because of the music...the lyrics on this cd disappointed me greatly.
B0006399FS|5.0|I want to start out by saying that this album took some serious time and listening to grow on me. Some people dislike the idea of repeated listens to something you have a negative first reaction to, but this album kept drawing me back. I will go through track by track to give my impressions, because each song has its own unique life that contributes to the continuity of the album as a whole.     1. Vertigo-Didn't like this song at first. It sounded too much like Elevation, but I had to give it a fair chance. What got me was when I first really heard Bono sing \\"Hola!\\" after Hello Hello. This struck me as some sort of esoteric, off-the-wall humor, and I was sold. Great rhythm section, displaying Larry's \\"elegant\\" drumming, as Springsteen put it.  2. Miracle Drug-Loved this song immediately, and I still do. Bono still has the voice and the range, and he can bring this song from universal to completely personal in one line: \\"There is no failure here, sweetheart, just when you quit.\\" His phrasing on the word sweetheart is unique and vulnerable, and adds an entire new element to the song. For you to decide what it's really about.   3. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own-The soul of this song is wrapped up in the note Bono hits in the bridge when he soars \\"Can you hear me when I sing.\\" He explains that his father loved the opera, and he provides a bridge between the listener and the subject by including such an aural tribute. He's no Bocelli, but he isn't trying to be. He's simply trying to be Bob Hewson's son.   4. Love and Peace-I recoiled when I first heard this song. It bothered me, and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. After really listening to the inner workings of the music, it reminds me of Achtung Baby, and that can't be anything but good. Experimental, devastating guitar riffs from the Edge provide the backdrop to Bono's rise-and-fall, all-out pleading.   5. City of Blinding Lights-This is the best song U2 has done since \\"One,\\" in my opinion. Like Miracle Drug, Bono's lyrics and delivery sound general but become specific. His great gift as a lyricist is his ability to write and sing lyrics that are so personal and specific to himself, yet that so many can directly relate to. He explained that the song is about \\"innocence and naivete,\\" and Bono masterfully portrays innocence, especially in lines such as \\"Time won't take the boy out of this man.\\"   6. All Because of You-Another one that didn't treat me well upon first listen. I think part of my distaste for this album originally stemmed from my disbelief that they would be able to top \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" But I soon realized that it wasn't about trying to top anything, but more about trying to convey some kind of truth that they felt, whether musical or lyrical. This tune has some great lines such as \\"Some people get squashed under the tracks, some people got highrises on their backs, I'm not broke but you can see the cracks.\\" Not the best on the album, but definitely not bad at all.  7. A Man and A Woman-This is a different approach for The Edge, displaying acoustic guitar more prominently than electric, and it is a breath of fresh air. It may be lighter than anything else on the album, but that is the point: the music mirrors the lyrics effectively. \\"Only true love can make beauty innocent.\\" Adam plays a great bass line in the beginning of the song as well, which intertwines itself with the guitar, reminiscent of \\"Grace\\" from ATYCLB.  8. Crumbs From Your Table: Gritty lyrics here in the verses from Bono, but they work for what he's trying to say. I always think of this song as sepia-toned; something about the tone of the guitar and the octave seperation on Bono's voice gives me that mental picture. The drumming here is great.  9. One Step Closer: Past reviews have ripped this song for \\"never really taking off.\\" Well, maybe that's the point. The theme of the song is being so close to something that you can almost touch it, but it's perpetually out ofreach. Thus, the music is so close to \\"taking off,\\" but it never really does. This would, of course, mirror the lyrical theme. I think it's intentional, and brilliant.   10. Original of The Species-This is somewhat of an epic, with several sections that are totally different from one another. The lyrics, written about Bono's daughter, are heartfelt and delivered with vulnerability, something that Bono does regularly with mastery. I personally think this is a great, classic U2 song, and one that will continue to be thought of as part of their important canon.  11. Yahweh-This band is more effective than any other at raising spiritual questions in a secular setting, and I think it is because of the fact that they are raising questions, not shoving answers. People tired of Bono's supposed \\"big-headedness\\" should realize that most of it is tongue-in-cheek (think about the Pop and Zoorapa albums) and listen to the humility in his lyrics. His voice particularly shines in it's upper register on this song, for instance on the singing of the second \\"Yahweh\\" in the chorus.     This album is quite an achievement for a band that has been in the spotlight for 25 years. They continue to be relevant, raising important questions about God, themselves, and those around them. For a great insight into who Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. really are, read the speech given by Bruce Springsteen at the R&R Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony (March, 05).
B007V4QMCI|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 2nd Grade. I enjoyed this album so much it is part of my music library. This album is a non-stop, funk-driven ride that kicks the assumption of a sophomore jinx to the curb. This album not only describes the dominant personality traits of TLC, but it speaks to the facets of all women. Taking whatever direction they felt comfortable with musically to express themselves. This album spans the way people relate to one other. They had top producers crafting their signature tracks for this album.  This album has been certified 11x Platinum. Remember, this was 1994-1995.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I like this album its good but not great. Nor is it better that A Rush of Blood to the Head, which to me was a bit more edgier.  While this album realizes itself sonically, it ultimately fails lyrically. The 2 previous efforts had more depth to them, this one seems to have one overall theme...Chris and Gwen. It also feels a bit contrived and forced, unlike Rush of Blood which was refreshing and inventive...natural. With that said, it's really a great album by itself but just not their best. Best three tracks Fix You, Swallowed by the Sea, x&Y. Worst track A Message.  <br />I definately recommend this album. I know I have said some negative things, however, be assured that it's only because I regard them as a great band with much better potential.
1881273156|5.0|Have you ever wondered how to relate to others?  We all have our own different love lanuguages.  Expressing love in the way that the other person understands it, as well as expressing the way that you need love.  This book does more than relate your relationship to just your mate.  This book can help you with parents, children, extended family, and friends.<br /><br />This book helps take a look at the people in your lives and the way they express and need love.  Some people express by touching, what they say, what they do, ect.  The key to connecting with different people is realizing what language of love they speak and connecting with them in that way.<br /><br />The text is very easy to read, and is very clear on his suggestions for how to make your relationships better.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, you certainly do not need to be in a romantic relationship to benefit from this book.  This book is well worth the read!

B00005JNJT|4.0|I didn't think the kid could pull off the newest version of the Dark Knight, but he does at least as good a job as Michael Keaton and actually comes off more dark - although contrived in places.<br /><br />The story follows the origin of Batman but does not stick with the Tim Burton storyline. For one, Batman's parents are not killed by Jack Napier - the criminal who becomes the Joker. Commissioner Gordon also has his relationship bridged to Batman in this film but again, it doesn't follow the original 1990 film version.<br /><br />The SCARECROW is not the scarecrow you might have remembered. They water down this particular villain so much that he looks little more than a drop in a bucket. In truth, he is merely the \\"pawn\\" of a much greater evil.<br /><br />Once again, we see Liam Neeson portraying the mentor type(See also Star Wars Episode One, Gangs of New York, and Kingdom of Heaven), as he teaches a young Bruce Wayne all about the ways of fighting technique and skill. It is notable that young Bruce already possesses some knowledge of the martial arts. No explanation is given in how he came to know some very remarkable moves.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU BELIEVE THE HYPE ABOUT THIS BEING THE BEST INSTALLMENT in the Batman series, watch it first. Even with the great acting ensemble (Morgan Freeman, Bale, Gary Oldman, Holmes, Nolan), the original Batman still has a slight edge in my opinion due to the Nicholson performance and deeper sense of darkness surrounding Michael Keaton's portrayal of the Batman character. That's not the say the style of the original is better. This current Batman film has some of the best shots I've ever seen in the series.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer provides a typical Hans Zimmer score, which is, as usual, captivating.<br /><br />This is right there with the original in terms of depth and acting. The storyline is a bit more believable but folks, this is based on a comic book. If you're looking for reality, try the Independent Film Channel.<br /><br />As close to excellent as they get, without actually arriving there.annel.  <br /> <br />As close to excellent as they get, without actually arriving there.

B0006IIKS0|3.0|I wondered why ST Anger was so pitiful, then this movie answered all my questions. Pretty much all through this movie Hetfield goes through therepy and everyone argues with each other. No one practices as much as they used to, and you wonder why they can hardly play on st anger? There was so much crap going on in there lives it was almost impossible to make a good album. Plus I think they lost any inspiration. <br />    In the movie, it seemed they were making the album, pretty much just to make one and get some money. You never get the feeling that they were really enthestiastic about it. Even Mustain, in the movie, is full of joy that Metallica has fallen on there faces. <br />   Bob Rock, a producer, should havetold then what they were making was crap. This movie should give musicians warning not to hire him.  <br />  However, I must admit there are some funny parts. I always find it funny when a 40 year old throws a chair or knocks a door down or when a group of them sit around and cuss at each other. A documentary? Maybe. A comedy of a fallen band, yes!
B000001EHS|5.0|Whooooooooooo!!! This album is great. It was my first exposure to Def Leppard and I can guarantee I will purchase more of their music.  <br /> <br />Some of the stand-out tracks for me personally were:  <br /> <br />\\"Pour some Sugar on Me\\": A great hard rock song which I had heard on the radio before I purchased the album. It is actually what inspired me to get it.  <br /> <br />\\"Photograph\\": Possibly my favorite song on the album. It is a great power ballad with a catchy guitar riff and just a great melody.  <br /> <br />\\"Let's Get Rocked\\": An awesome hard rock tune. I love the part at the end when it goes up a key; really good music.  <br /> <br />\\"Two Steps Behind\\": A really mellow acoustic-based love song. I think the lyrics are kind of corny, but it has a really good refrain and harmonies.  <br /> <br />\\"Rocket\\": I liked this song from the first time I heard it. It's a very spacey, and just downright cool tune. I sing along with the refrain every time. \\"Rocket, Ye-ah!\\"  <br /> <br />If you're a first-timer like me to Def Leppard's music, you should deffinitely consider buying this album. It's a great sampler of their music. I'm already planning on going to their concert for when they come to Cleveland. Let's Get Rocked!!!  <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|X & Y is Coldplay at its finest.  The cd shows all the nuances and capabilities of Coldplay in songs that inspire, drive, energize, and touch the heart.  Every song on this cd is worth the listen.  Because I am a \\"heart\\" person, though, I'd say that song #4 is by far the best track.  \\"Fix you\\" is like an amazingly beautiful flower, unfolding instrument by instrument into a crescendo of emotion.  It is, in fact, THE single most beautiful song I've ever heard.  I strongly recommend this cd to any and all Coldplay fans.  It is a must buy -- and a sure future classic.
B0009K7RTI|5.0|This movie is just incredibly funny. I really can't explain why I like this movie so much, but I just do.It is definitely my favorite comedy movie. I have seen it at least 10 times, liking it more every time I watch it. I can't wait for it to come out on umd for the PSP. Napoleon Dynamite is \\"Flippin Sweet\\".
B000002H97|3.0|There are some catchy songs on here, but this album points out where metallica definitely went more mainstream. The new direction (coperate, absolute greed) would eventually tarnish the reputation and careers of the band mates. They found success in the album, but at a price. They became lazy, less dedicated in production. They started arguing all the time, thus having mediocre albums coming out after this.  The songs are shorter, less complex, the solos less inspiring, and the riffs! It sounds as if the soul has been sucked out of James, and I dont mean just to give to the devil. In short, they sold out. The songs average less than 3 minutes. None of that 8 minutes plus like on \\"Justice for All\\" Or \\"Master of Puppets.\\" It's not 'different' as some will point out, but more watered down, commercial. Hetfield, if you just want to make a ton of money, why don't you just join N Sync?   True, this is the most popular of the albums, the \\"American Idol\\" album for Metallica. The things that usually are most commerical are too broad and lose there artistic vision. The very thing Metallica stood for when they came out, \\"Going against the Man\\" ended. They were the man now. Years later they praised MTV. Like I said, commerical.  Kirt Hammet was never a great solo writer, but his solos got worse, not better. This album too reflexes the change. Hammet literally rapes his wah. It's on every solo. Man, I didn't touch my wah petal for months after hearing this album. On alighter note, The bass is ok, nothing new, but nothing awful. To me, Cliff was really the only great bassist for Metallica. After that, nothing that inspiring came from the bass on there albums.  I never though Bob Rock was a good producer for Metallica, and I hope maybe his departure from them will help them. (He produced the crappy St Anger) but it may be too late. Hell, I'm tempted to just give up on them and hope they retire. (And stay that way)  For Good Metallica Albums, Kill Them All through And Justice Forall. Pretty much any Metallica fan will agree. One last thing, this is a ok album. Still has some old influence from the older albums, the suckiness of St Anger hasn't came in as of this point. It is a \\"OK\\" album to listen to, but by no means a classic.

B00005JLRT|4.0|This definitely could have been a better Star Trek movie, but it was still enjoyable.  I heard Marina Sirtis (the actress who plays Troi) talk about the flaws in this movie.  Most important was that the director never saw Star Trek before filming and never saw fit to watch any of it.  He wanted to make an action movie, which is what he did.  He cut out all the interpersonal relationships which make Trek what it is (check out the deleted scenes!).  He even wanted to cut the wedding completely out.<br /><br />That said, the villain was more engaging than the cookie-cutter villains in past TNG films, the special effects were great and the ending was surprisingly touching.  Worth the money!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Well, I've done a pretty thorough perusal of the reviews placed on this board, and I'm astounded (but not surprised) by the amount of people that have missed the point on this album.  I'll lay it out for those of you who didn't get it. <br /> <br />System of a Down uses a literary tool called irony in their songs, and for those of you who have blatantly criticized the chorus of \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" for being too much like a boy-band song, you missed it.  SOAD isn't advocating that type of lifestyle, they are criticizing it through the use of sarcasm!  Also, for those who call SOAD hypocritical for being anti-establishment and anti-celebrity and yet live in California, allow me to present this point to you: what better way to change the things you need to change than by diving into the belly of the beast? <br /> <br />I don't think SOAD is the greatest metal band ever, but they are necessary!  They are political, but not preachy, and this type of artistic expression is needed.  Besides, no one takes U2 seriously anymore, so we need someone to take over.  I think this album is great because you have to think about what the lyrics mean.  I'm sorry that SOAD didn't spoonfeed a bunch of grunts and growls to some of the reviewers, but it's called \\"growth\\" and SOAD is doing just that.  Serj alone makes this band worth experiencing.  This guy can do more things with his voice than Martha Stewart can do with a potato peeler.
0060254920|5.0|How I wish I was given this book as a child! However no matter what your age you should enjoy this book for its beauty and whimsy. <br /> <br />Before the phrase \\"a time out\\" be came part of the mainstream and before the practice became  a part of good parenting we see the little hero of this story, Max, being sent to his room for being a \\"wild thing. However in his room in his mind he travels to a place where real \\"wild things\\" live.  <br /> <br />The  creatures Sendak draws are absolutely <br />wonderful - they are morphologically frightening chimeras whose  sci-fi creepiness is balanced equally  with expressions that are  over the top on the cute meter. They are rendered masterfully  with line shading  and  colored brightly but serenely. <br />Max in his monster pjs  tames these beasties and rules over this kingdom. <br /> <br />The book is a nice piece of art that any adult will appreciate but for kids it is a great story  with more than one message. Its most important message, to my way of thinking, is that in these days when we are  teaching people how to be  couch potatoes at an ever increasingly early age the imagination is the most  rewarding form of entertainment. <br /> <br />\\"Let the wild rumpus begin!\\" <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"
B000063DFN|5.0|This is iron maidens first pure metal album. Their previous releases were metal but they were also very much punk (Iron Maiden, Killers) or Rock based (Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind). On This album however there is no trace of any punk or Rock, it is 100% Heavy Metal. By the time this album was released Iron Maiden was the most popular Metal/Hard Rock band around. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Aces High (5/5)- My favorite Iron Maiden song, the opening verse sends chills down my spine  2.Two Minutes Too Midnight (5/5)- Awesome riff, classic metal song, this was also a huge hit for Iron Maiden  3.Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) (3/5)- Iron Maidens best instrumental, but still im not really feelin it  4.Flash Of The Blade (4/5)- A real Metal Riff  5.The Duellists (4/5)- Good Song, Catchy Chorus  6.Back In The Village (4/5)- Another total metal riff  7.Powerslave (2.5/5)- Worst song on the album, Cool egyptian sounding riff but the chorus ruins the whole song  8.Rime Of The Ancient Mariner (5/5)- based on a poem by the same name, great song    If you like metal definitely buy this album, if you like hard rock than check it out.    If you like this album you might also like:  Queensryche- The Warning  Dio- The Last In Line  Megadeth- So Far,So Good,So What  Judas Priest- Defenders Of The Faith
B0008KLVG4|5.0|What can I say I agree with everyone else here.  The movie studios really love to stick it to you.  They call people who download movies and music thieves.  well what do we call them?  Jaws 10th anniversary, then 25th, then 30th, resident evil special edition!!, resident evil all access edition!!!  I will actually buy this because my original is worn out and needs replacing anyways.  But come on how many re releases is enough?  I swear they must have a special meeting place where they all spend so much time in a given day trying to figure out how to stick it to the customer a little more.  No wonder there are pirates out there can ya blame em?  Oh and for you folks who don't get a chance to buy this version don't worry there will be a 31st, 32nd and so on release.  As long as the studio execs can turn a dime this won't be the last re release of jaws I guarantee it!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I've read many of the reviews posted here and most of them make note of the fact that the guitar playing is awesome, innovative, etc.  While that's true, the guitar playing alone is not what makes this a great album.  Sure, the great guitar playing drives the sound.  However, there is much more to Van Halen than the two-handed tapping technique, fast guitar solos and dive-bomb whammy bar sound effects.  The overall sound and feel make this one of the best rock albums ever.  One of the most definitive things about the Van Halen sound is the drums and the solid rhythm that allows Eddie to take off and do his guitar thing.  There are many drummers who have better chops than Alex but not many who have such a definitive sound who can lay down a rhythm to support Eddie's playing style.  The Van Halen brothers definitely have a very special vibe between them musically and rhythmically.   Add Michael's rock-sold bass playing to the mix then throw in Eddie's playing and you have one of the tightest bands ever.  Van Halen's music is often labeled hard rock or heavy metal.  However, I don't agree with the label.  They took boogie and the blues to a totally different area.  This is good time, loud, energetic boogie/blues rock on steroids.  This is a must have album for anyone who loves guitar or anyone who misses the days when rock was about good times, great women, having fun and getting totally pumped up by the music.  Buy this album, turn it up really loud, jump in your car and hit the road.  If you've never heard this album (have been living in a cave?), then you'll end up putting the CD on repeat and listening to it several times.  <br /> <br />Having said that, one does have to acknowledge the Eddie factor.  Eddie is a master of the hard rockin', hard drivin' guitar riffs and easily weaves flurries of lead licks into the rhythm guitar work.  He broke the mold by combining rhythm and lead guitar at the same time.  This self-titled debut album was pretty much recorded livewith no or minimal guitar overdubbing to get the guitar solos in.  That was pretty much unheard of during the 70's when the disco sound was prevalent and studio engineers were having a field day overproducing albums to get rid of the raw, gutsy sound of a live band.  At the time this album came out, most bands had two or more guitar players and it was very uncommon to see someone play both lead and rhythm at the same time.  I find it amazing that everyone talks so much about the two-handed tapping technique that Eddie introduced on a grand scale to the rock world (He wasn't the first player to use two hands on the neck).  The majority of the guitar work on this album that really gets your blood pumping is done the old fashioned way without the tapping trick.  Any real guitar player will tell you that Eddie's guitar work done without the tapping trick is his most awesome playing.  Just listen to Ice Cream Man.  The solo in Ice Cream Man is one of the most awesome blue-inspired rock guitar solos of all time.  The lead work in that song is perhaps even better than Eruption.  Even in Eruption, the most impressive parts of the solo are the ones played in the standard style.  The two-handed tapping technique doesn't enter the solo until the ending section.  He introduced the idea of tremolo picking (a picking technique often used in Spanish and Flamenco music) to the rock masses in Eruption.  Again, this wasn't a new technique for playing the guitar.  It has been around for hundreds of years.  However, Eddie was the first to really incorporate the technique into a rock-n-roll guitar arsenal. <br /> <br />In addition to the guitar techniques, Eddie also has an extremely keen sense of timing and rhythm.  His playing style has often been referred to as \\"falling down the steps and always landing on his feet\\".  It's this type of build-up of tension (falling down the steps) followed by the resolution of that tension (landing on his feet) that make Eddie Van Halen one of the most gifted and influential rock guitarists of all time.   <br /> <br />This album is sure to please most anyone who is a true rock fan.  I have three daughters ranging from 2  years to 11 years old.  When I put my Van Halen CD's in, they beg me to crank up the volume.  They love it!  These are kids that normally listen to No Doubt, Ashlee Simpson, Britney Spears, and all the other nonsense out there that kids call music.   <br /> <br />This album and the other early pre-Sammy albums are \\"must haves\\".  In particular, I would recommend Women and Children First, Fair Warning, Diver Down and 1984. <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I never would have known this cd was copy protected if I hadn't read all this whining about big corporations ruining music and the Foos selling out! <br /> <br />I brought the album home, ripped both discs to itunes and burned copies for my car like I do with every other cd I buy. Didn't run into any problems!! Then I read all the reviews and, out of curiosity, tried it in an older computer with an older version of itunes, plugged in my ipod and still no problems!! Unless I somehow bought the only unprotected copy they released, the copy protection will not prevent you from enjoying the music!! <br /> <br />The hard rock side is good and by itself would be one of the better Foo Fighters albums to date.  It has more of the heavier rock that the Foos have written in the past but it is definitely not the same.  This is a band that has truly evolved over the years but hasn't lost its origional identity. <br /> <br />I've heard acoustic versions of alot of the Foo Fighters songs; Everlong, Times Like These, My Hero, etc. so I was expecting more of the same with the acoustic disc.  I was wrong.  It was much more creative than that and showed how versitile this band is.  <br /> <br />If you refuse to buy In Your Honor because you don't want to support 'the man and his facist control over the music industry' or some other hippy crap then you are really missing out on arguably the best music of the Foo Fighters and possibly the best album released in a few years by any artist.
0790729725|1.0|Quality of the transfer is bad as is the fact this is a \\"fliper\\".<br /><br />No, not j.kerry a DVD that you have to turn over half way through the movie.  There's no reason for either of these.
0452282152|4.0|This was a very quick read for me, though it didn't lack in luster from its pint-size. This book is not full of gripping peaks and on-the-edge-of -your-seat plot developments; it is full of vivid descriptions, subtleties, and wonderful character development. The book is about Griet, a sixteen-year-old girl who comes to work for the famous artist, Vermeer. Though she is of lower class and a maid she still puts people in their place and doesn't allow them to walk all over her due to her status in society. She has an acute understanding of human nature which helps her in her struggles with this family. The `love story' that ensues is extremely subtle; a brush of the hair, a breath on the neck, a glace from the corner of the eye. I just love how the author took the painting and created this amazing and believable story behind it.
B00008972S|3.0|Many things puzzle me about the movie version.  Why have an overture, it really slows down the film especially as the \\"Prologue\\" (the real beginning of the show, there never was an overture) follows, that is 14mins of music, you need to build the tension straight away. <br /> <br />The intermission is set in the wrong place, the reason it is after \\"The Rumble\\" is to add tension, they also should have left \\"I feel pretty\\" after the rumble as it seems more tragic for Maria to be so happy not knowing what has just happened. <br /> <br />The performances were another disappointing aspect of the movie, many overacted or seemed miscast such as Russ Tamblyn, I wouldn't be scared of him if he had a bomb strapped to him, most of the Jets and Sharks look like harmless boys, with the exception of Tucker Smith who looks like he has a bit of edge to him. <br /> <br />I was also disappointed in the singing, Marni Nixon's voice sounds old when you see it come out of Natalie Wood's small young body, Carol Lawrence had a sweet pure almost operatic voice that suited Maria, although I would prefer a Puerto Rican character to be played by a Puerto Rican actor. <br /> <br />Whoever did Richard Beymer's singing doesn't have the youthful exuberance of Larry Kert, while Rita Moreno's voice is a little too soft; Chita has that spark in her voice.  However Rita put in a fine performance acting wise. <br /> <br />The chemistry between Richard and Natalie is non-existent, buy Ed Sullivans The Best of Broadway Musicals which has Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence performing \\"Tonight\\", and you will see the difference.  Considering Larry Kert was gay his Tony did a much better job convincing me he loved Maria then Richard Beymer's. <br /> <br />The choreography and dancing is great especially during \\"Cool\\", although from what I have seen of Chita it seems slightly parred down for Rita Moreno, I also noticed the wonderful ballet during \\"Somewhere\\" was cut completely, which is very unfortunate. <br /> <br />What I did like was swapping \\"Cool\\" and \\"Gee, Officer Krupke\\".  It suits the show a lot more to have a tense song like \\"Cool\\" in the second act. <br /> <br />I also like that they took advantage of New York during the \\"Prologue\\", I wish they had shot all of it on location. <br /> <br />The orchestrations are great, sometimes better than the original OBC. \\"America\\" is reshaped to be a sparring match between the Sharks and their girls, great restaging, although the lyrics don't flow as well and my favourite line was cut  <br /> <br />Rosalia: \\"When I will go back to San Juan\\"  <br />Anita: \\"When you will shut-up and get gone!\\" <br /> <br />They could have easily kept this line between Bernado and Anita. <br /> <br />I added a star for the extras, very detailed and well presented, I especially liked the making of and interviews. <br /> <br />All in all not a terribly bad film, but nowhere near as good as it could have been, I know Arthur Laurents was not a fan of this movie and I can see why, however if you don't know anything about the original and have not heard the performances before, you might enjoy this film, I recommend renting it first, if you like it buy it. <br />
B00030590I|4.0|This is a review of the DVD version of \\"Hero,\\" directed by Zhang Yimou.  (There are some spoilers in this review, but I do not reveal everything.)<br /><br />I have long admired \\"To Live,\\" Zhang Yimou's chronicle of one family's experiences through China's tumultuous early twentieth century. In fact, I often use it in my classes. So I was looking forward to seeing \\"Hero.\\" \\"Hero\\" is a different genre of film, but it is a great film in its own way. I have wanted to write a review of it, but it's hard to do it justice.<br /><br />One can easily appreciate it, I think, without knowing much of anything about Chinese history. But one's experience is greatly deepened if one does know more.<br /><br />For example, the nameless warrior (played by Jet Li) says he wanted to see his future opponent Broken Sword write the 20th form of the character for \\"sword,\\" because seeing his style of calligraphy would give him enough insight into his swordsmanship to defeat him. This follows a long tradition in East Asian thought that \\"the Way of the sword and the Way of the brush are one.\\" This is true in a technical sense, in that both require a particular combination of power and grace in one's hand and arm, but also in a philosophical sense, because both require a Zen-like focus on one's craft. (During an attack in which thousands of arrows fly through the calligraphy school, we see Broken Sword calmly practice the character as arrows whiz by his head, and in the same sequence the calligraphy master instructs his pupils to return to their desks, and practice during the attack.)<br /><br />When he hears the story, the King of Qin smiles and remarks, \\"Imagine that. Twenty ways to write the same character.\\" When he conquers all of China and finally becomes the \\"First Emperor,\\" he will standardize the style of characters (setting a standard that lasts essentially till today -- the forms of Chinese characters are recognizable two millennia later because of him), as well as standardizing weights, measures and laws.<br /><br />But although there is much that is historically accurate in this movie, it is not primarily historical fiction. In every fight scene, the acrobatics defy physics. This is a convention of Chinese martial arts films, which the broader American audience came to know through \\"The Matrix.\\" In \\"The Matrix,\\" we suspend disbelief because a premise of the film is that the world as we know it is an illusion, and to the extent that one can see through the illusion, one can violate what is supposedly natural law.<br /><br />But from the nameless warrior's first battle with Sky, the flying leaps signal something very different, and very crucial, to us: we are in mythical space. We are in the same space in which Odysseus blinds the cyclopes, and in which Jesus heals the blind. Everything here is true, but not true in the way that an almanac is true. Things are unreal, to warn us that they point beyond themselves to something more real.<br /><br />Part of what they point to is specific. Chinese, especially on the mainland, have wrestled with the legacy of Mao. Literally millions of people starved because of Mao's crackpot ideas, and countless thousands were executed or publicly humiliated in his campaigns to rid the country of subversive elements. But Mao compared himself to the First Emperor. Yes, he was draconian. But he unified China after a period of civil war and disunity, and ultimately strengthened it. Just a few years after he came to power, China fought the U.S. to a draw in the Korean War. And China would not be a superpower (or on the verge of being one) if it were still engaged in the endless struggle born of disunity.<br /><br />In the film, the nameless warrior wants to kill the King of Qin because the King's armies killed his parents. Broken Sword had a chance to kill the King, but stopped at the last minute. His lover, Flying Snow, can never forgive him for this, because the King had killed her father. Broken Sword asks the nameless warrior not to kill the King of Qin, and writes two characters in the sand to explain why. They are tian xia, \\"beneath Heaven,\\" an idiom in Chinese meaning \\"the world.\\"<br /><br />They all have good reason to kill the King of Qin. But they must sacrifice themselves and their goals for something more important than any one of them: the well being of the world.<br /><br />The sacrifices are tragic. The nameless warrior is too dangerous to be allowed to live. Because of all that has happened between them, Broken Sword and Flying Snow can no longer live. But the results of any other actions would have been more tragic.<br /><br />So Zhang Yimou's film has a specific political subtext. But it also has a more general significance, because the issues that people in China have faced are special cases of issues that all humans face: love, loyalty and the often tragic conflict between the good of the individual and the good of everyone \\"under Heaven.\\"cters in the sand to explain why.

B00028HBKM|1.0|I am willing to give Gibson credit for good camera work.<br /><br />After that - Nothing else. This film is meant to tell the \\"true Story\\" of the Jesus mythology.  Being that Jesus is a myth there is no true story.<br /><br />The fact is the myth is borrowed, verbatim, from other mythologies that predate Christianity by about 2,900 years. Read The Secret Origins of the Bible by Tim Callahan.<br /><br />Those who accept this as truth have got to learn to question things in an intelligent manner. If GOD gave you a BRAIN he might want you to take it out of the garage for a drive.<br /><br />If something is \\"REAL\\" it will stand up to scrutiny and unbiased testing.

B000066NW0|1.0|You people got to be kidding me, the way everyone talks about this Avril Lavigne girl, they act as if she actually invented rock, or that she's actually breaking new musical grounds or that she's actually a proffesioanal guitarist. HAHAHA, PLEASE! People actually kiss up to Avril! If you think this is punk, or heavy metal, then somethings wrong. You ovbiously have never heard of REAL rock guitarists like Jimmy Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, Yngwie Malmsteen, Zakk Wylde, and real contemporary  jazz guitarists like Paul Jackson, Norman Brown and Larry Carlton! If you think Avril is rock, you ovbiously never heard of REAL rock bands like Lamb Of God, Slipknot, Rammstein, Decide, Suffocation, Candiria, Machine Head, Pantera, Slayer, Burnt By The Sun, Psyopus, Emperor, Necrophagist, Children Of Bodom, Krisiun, Mudvayne, Trivium, Shadows Fall, and Mastodon! You guys disgust me...running around acting like listening to Avril Lavigne makes you punk or hardcore. Grow up! She's not heavy metal! She's not rock! She's not punk! She's pop-rock, which is not REAL rock. Learn your music genres! REAL Punk is stuff like The Ramones, The Clash, The Virus, and The Casulaties. Avril Lavigne is so commercial, and manufactured. Avril really takes the word \\"Poser\\" to a new level. Because of Avril, you see so many kids ages 11-14 constantly buying her albums and then running around wearing stuff from hot topic trying to skateboard when they can't do something as easy as an ollie. She also needs to learn to act right, too, you don't go around busting and insulting on pop musicians like Hilary Duff and Britney Spears on TV when your own music is under the pop music genre. Wait until your music actually becomes real rock...then you have the right to insult. If you ask me, this Avril Lavinge has alot of growing up to do. Everyone acts like she's the best guitarist and the best musician out there when she isn't. Avril is not helping or saving rock music...in fact, she's disgracing rock music! The only reason people are so attracted to this stuff is becuase Avril Lavigne and her band members can play a guitar and write catchy lyrics with a catchy chorus, with music to dance and jump around to. But that doesn't make it good! It doesn't make it complicated and heavy! Her stuff is easy to play, espaccialy compared to some of the music artists I've listed above! Why don't you people listen to some REAL musicans for a change and stop eating everything that MTV, the radio, and music companies shove down your throats all the time.reason people are so attracted to this stuff is becuase Avril Lavigne and her band members can play a guitar and write catchy lyrics with a catchy chorus, with music to dance and jump around to.

0440180295|5.0|Vonnegut's SH5 deserves its place in the pantheon of great 20th century literature. It is one of the most moral books ever written. Easily at the top of his canon and likely, the only one of his works that will stand the test of time (although much of his work is great and relevant). <br /> <br />Most people are familiar with the central character, Billy Pilgrim, and how he time travels back and forth, with the help of aliens, between his experiences in WWII (largely, the author's) and his comfortable suburban life in the 1960's. But, don't let this sci-fi device fool you into thinking the story is light hearted: its not. Vonnegut is a very eclectic writer who often uses various tricks and slights-of-hand to make a point, or sometimes, to structure an entire work. In this book, you can view Billy's time travel and his interactions with the aliens as metaphors for trauma. The parallels between some of those experiences and that of soldiers suffering 'shell shock' are very close. <br /> <br />He also finds space to make some other points and philosophical musings. One that I found worthwhile was the aliens' ability to view life in its totality without being hindered by linear time. So, for example, if they view a dead man, they think that he's only in a bad way at that point in time, but in other points of time (which all co-exist simultaneously in their quantum perception), he's still doing fine. Some critics have used these musings to say that the novel lacks a moral vision. Or that Vonnegut is not taking grave things, like dying, seriously.  I disagree. I think these other perspectives show the author struggling with ways to make sense of a chaotic world. Much of which, he experienced first hand (as did Heller and JD Salinger, curiously).  <br /> <br />With the current hostilities which abound in the world, this book couldn't be more timely. It remains the best cautionary tale about war (with all due respect to \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", \\"Catch 22\\" and \\"RedBadge of Courage\\") and a great reminder of the horror and futility of unnecessary war acts.  <br /> <br />As a resident of the world's top military power, I'd say this book should be mandatory reading everywhere!

B00092ZL80|5.0|I DVR'd this concert (in hi-def and 5.1) off of INHD and have watched many times.  The concerts they have shown have been identical to the DVD's of the same name so I'm assuming the same will hold true on this release.  (DVD has a few MORE songs than concert shown on cable- see below)  This show is about two hours long with the combined bands starting together for a few songs, then EWF, then Chicago, and then combined again for the last three or so.  I bought concert tickets for later this summer after seeing this.  The sound quality is superb which now I understand as it was produced by Image who did the first Eagles and Steely Dan DVD's, and always have superior production.  The DVD also has a DTS track.  As far as the performance, I think 1+1 >2.  I have the Chicago Soundstage DVD and the EWF Live by Request and this is better than both.  Chicago particularly benefits as their energy level is much higher here than on the solo disc.  EWF's influence adds more hipness, funk, and energy to Chicago's more ballady style.  I really disliked the Peter Cetera fill in (bass player) on the Chicago solo disc as he used vibrato that was irritating, but he doesn't do it here and sounds much better.  The Maurice White fill-in has also changed for EWF and I think the new guy does a better job too than on the Live By Request disc.

B00007E8V4|5.0|Wow, System Of A Down really blows me away with their powerfull guitars and bass and their awesome fast drummer and their crazy vocalist. This is some great stuff to jump around and bang your head to. I really like the pizza pie song, really nice. This band is talented and forcefull, and is some excellent heavy metal, and it's really taking rock music to a whole new level. It really amazes me, I've always been a fan of System Of A Down, and I've always loved their heavy music. All of their songs on hear are good, and I just love listening to it. I also highly reccomend checking out all of their other ablums as well.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I've always liked Jack Black. Chris Farley has some sort of iconic legend stature of comedians but if you ask me, Black is far more talented -- he's naturally very funny, like Belushi or Candy, and has perfect timing; he can be quite intellectual (compared to \\"SNL\\"-type comedians, obviously) -- for example his biting satirical comedy is close to Steve Martin's early stuff (which means he has a lot of promise as far as I'm concerned). And he's crude and over-the-top without being obnoxious like Farley, who I never found funny in the least. <br /> <br />Like Belushi, Black favors himself as some type of musician -- and like Belushi, he really CAN sing! If you've seen \\"High Fidelity\\" you probably already know this, but \\"Tenacious D\\" -- the eponymous album from Black's band Tenacious D -- is even better than his singing there; it mixes great lyrics with funny \\"skits\\" and such. <br /> <br />It's musically vibrant enough to actually make you want to listen to it just for the music (especially the song \\"Tribute,\\" a.k.a. \\"The Greatest Song in the World), whilst being laugh-out-loud funny. This will make you want to chuck that Jimmy Fallon CD right into the garbage bin; this is grade-A quality stuff, and perhaps a sign of things to come from Black when he's not on-screen.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce is one of music's biggest stars today. She's had the most successful solo career out the other 2 from Destinys Child. I do think she is a BIT overrated though. She does write all her material, but the lyrics are very mediocore. Some songs sound kinda like she wrote them when she was 13 but then some are magnificent. I think she should just stay solo, theres really no big difference. Even in Destiny's Child shes still writes all the music and recieves the most attention and vocals on the records, which is kind of unfair but thats how it is. <br />  <br />1. Crazy In Love  - 9/10 - Hot beat, good lyrics, she rocked it. <br />2. Naughty Girl  - 8/10 - Lyrics are bland, but very sexy. <br />3. Baby Boy  - 8/10 - Hot beat, lyrics bland, great dance song. <br />4. Hip Hop Star  - 7/10 - At first I loved this song, but then after a while got kind of boring. Still a good track though. <br />5. Be With You - 8/10 - Very nice, soulful, she sounds good. <br />6. Me, Myself And I - 9/10 - One of my favs, lyrics are kinda bland, but sends a good message.  <br />7. Yes - 8/10 - Another fav of mine, but once again, the lyrics. It seems shes trying to hard.  <br />8. Signs  - 8/10 - At first I hated this song, but then it grew on me, its different and I like it a lot. <br />9. Speechless - 10/10 -Absolute favourite track. One of the sexiest songs Ive ever heard. Her vocals are amazing on this track. <br />10. That's How You Like It - 5/10 - Wasnt feeling it.  <br />11. The Closer I Get To You  - 5/10 - Pretty song, nothing special about it. <br />12. Dangerously In Love 2 - 10/10 - Lovely lyrics, amazing vocals, this is the albums 2nd strongest track right behind \\"Speechless\\". <br />13. Beyonce Interlude     <br />14. Gift From Virgo  - 5/10 - Nothing special. <br />15. Daddy  - 7/10 - Nice tribute to her father. <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|To all the IDIOTS who bash this CD because of the Copy Protection: GET A LIFE!    First of all, Why judge the CD merely on the fact that it's copy-protected? It is NOT a band's decision but THEIR RECORD LABEL's!  Second, for all you I POD people, there are programs that trick the copy protection and you can just rip it like a normal cd in your computers, or just download the mp3s of usenet. ITS NOT A CRIME ONCE YOU OWN THE ORIGINAL CD!    And now to my real review:    This is the Foo's best CD since the Colour and the Shape. CD 1 just kicks my ass.  \\"In your honor\\" opens it with a blast. Is that Taylor Hawkings drumming? Don't think so, I think it's Dave, listen to PROBOT and you'll know what I mean.  \\"No way back\\" is the best song and should be their second single.   \\"Best of you\\" is a great choice for a first single, it's a real emotional song.     CD2 is kind of a folk cd with great melodies and great singing by Dave Grohl. It's a gem of an album with fits in with Beck's    Sea Change. The lyrics are deep and personal. \\"Friend of a friend\\" clearly is about Kurt Cobain.... how Dave Grohl still see's him writing songs on his old acoustic guitar.
B00007BKVC|3.0|Frankly speaking, one of the best reasons for viewing a movie such as \\"Thelma and Louise\\", especially at this late date, is to then be able to enjoy reading others' opinions on this amazon site. I'm amused by the way this movie apparently pushed a lot of peoples' buttons, both pro and con. In my case however, I'm not inclined to get that excited one way or the other. But it did please me to see the character of Thelma develop after breaking free from her domineering schmuck of a spouse. Like Louise, I was happy for Thelma when she finally was treated to a pleasurable sensual experience (with Brad Pitt no less). And I got a vicarious thrill from 1) the bad-ass rapist getting shot, and 2) the dickweed driver getting his rig destroyed. But I thought that Louise's discussions with her boyfriend/fiance were tedious and disrupted the momentum of this road trip. Not that it matters; I'm just quibbling over details of a movie that I don't take too seriously in the first place. For those of you who do, lighten up!
B000063JDE|5.0|My teacher told me to see this, after I said I hadn't seen many David Lynch movies, saying I was missing an entire genre. And she was dead right, this is a whole new genre. This movie is usually put into the surrealism genre, but its not really that, its funny but its not a comedy, its disturbing but its not horror, its about a murder but its not a mystery, the only thing I could possibly consider comparing this to is Cronenberg's \\"Naked Lunch\\" solely because of the interesting settings, the strange plot, the 50's-esque styling, and most of all the over the top bizarre sex scenes. the whole plot is pretty much this:  a kid finds a human ear in the grass and tells the police, he then hears something about a local singer and believes that she may have something to do with the ear, he quickly decides to stake out her apartment, and thats where it gets hard to describe.  The charactors in the movie are amazing, dennis hopper is out of his ****ing mind and ben[played by the one guy from quantam leap] is \\"suave as ****\\" overall the movie is worth checking out if you like things that are just plain wierd, but if youre the average braindead hollywood blockbuster fan [the kind of person who likes movies like star wars 3 or matrix 2], you wont get it.    Also on the special edition special features, push up and select \\"special\\" for a neat easter egg of David Lynch rambling about mcdonalds
1401300901|4.0|I read this book at a very rapid pace and found myself alternately smiling and tearing up throughout.  It's the story of how a widow, left too soon by a husband who died of cancer too young, survives the first year of widowhood and slowly comes back to life, helped along by a monthly letter and surprise left behind by her husband.  It reminded me of a Maeve Binchy novel with a younger, more urban sensibility.  Excellent beach read, if you don't mind getting a bit choked up on the beach...
B000069AUI|1.0|This album is Coldplays 2nd album and I have rated it 1 star because I originally was going to give it 2 but that would rate it the same as \\"Parachutes\\" and this is by far a lot worse than that album. I remember hearing Chris Martin say that they would only record one album and then he'd go busk in Paris or somewhere... so much for that. <br /> <br />\\"Politik\\" starts the album off at a pounding plod with very dull lyrics and the vocal delivery isn't too good either,no matter how much Chris Martin multi-tracks his vocal it won't make it any more powerful sounding. Around the 3:20 point the song actually starts sounding very promising... until the singing starts again, this guy simply lacks delivery on this part and ruins what could have been a great middle section. The instrumental outro is the best part of the song and the most moving piece too. <br /> <br />\\"In My Place\\" features the traditional 3 note guitar \\"solo\\" motiff that Coldplay are famous for. This is simply \\"Yellow\\" part 2 and where the afore-mentioned song was bad... this is just as bad. With a slow thump and pace that almost makes you want to close your ears. I can see why it was chosen as a single, although out of the 3 big singles from this album this was the worst. <br /> <br />The third song \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\" is the albums 2nd best song. Where it lacks in lyrical content it makes up for in the music. A dark edge permeates this song and is highlighted well by \\"The Edge\\" sounding electric guitar. Sadly as mentioned earlier the lyrics are lacking and the mentioning of \\"lines\\" is back for the 8th time, it seems that \\"lines\\" and drawing them is a big deal for Chris Martin. <br /> <br />\\"The Scientist\\" the best single released by Coldplay... and you guessed it! Another love song. When will these boys tire of it? Musically it isn't much and lyrically it isn't fantastic, but the delivery of it and feel it what makes it the albums best song. Shame about the falsettos in the outro, getting over done in Coldplay material. The video was interesting though! <br /> <br />By now everyone should recognise the arpeggiated piano intro to \\"Clocks\\", a single, nothing amazing, and again it lacks in quality lyrics and the music is very repetitive. Also featuring the falsettos \\"aoooo oh\\" chorus which Chris thinks will never go out of fashion. But he does do some harmony vocals in the later verses.  <br /> <br />\\"Daylight\\" seems to be a filler song and nothing at all to talk about there really, except it is the albums 2nd longest song! The song that follows on is \\"Green Eyes\\" and again nothing fantastic in this one either... would have been a better b-side. <br /> <br />\\"Warning Sign\\" starts with an electric guitar and within a moment the boring drum beat kicks in that you hear in many a Coldplay song, the subject seems to be about missing a lover (no suprise there) and really goes nowhere but where it started. Longest song. <br /> <br />\\"A Whisper\\" is a promising more upbeat sounding tune, but gets lost in itself easily and has not much to talk about as it just seems to lack anything that would make the listener think \\"wow!\\" there is no wow factor here. <br /> <br />The albums title track is the penultimate song and drifts in a hazey mood. Not much really in this song either except for some slightly interersting sounds that fade into the song around the first minute. <br /> <br />\\"Amsterdam\\" ends the album at last and has some nice piano playing on it. Around the 3 minute mark is where the band kick in but as with most of the album there is nothing much to talk about in terms of quality. <br /> <br />Overall this album is a weaker comparison to their debut album and seems almost a re-hashing of what the public wanted. <br /> <br />
6305736650|4.0|Why is this 1942 movie the great classic cult film? <br />Bookcases have been filled with answers to this question. The most important point is however that you should first see the movie. <br /> <br />The story is timeless, the lines easy to remember, the shots are often perfect and watching the film cannot be a disappointment. <br /> <br />The fact that the story is timeless probably comes from the fact that ancient (by Hollywood standards) themes are played out: the independent cowboy Rick and the committed hero Lazlo. The bad guy from Berlin dies in a gun battle.  <br /> <br />The film is famous for the story that up to the last moment the directors had not clear ending in mind. Their solution, although highly improbable, is perfect: the committed hero gets the girl, the girl is acted upon (she has no influence on her fate), and the cowboy hero strolls towards the sunset towards new adventures. <br /> <br />The fact that the film was made in 1942 is significant: the  stick my neck out for no-one'position of Rick is heavily challenged throughout the movie. A reminder from 'businessman' Ferrari to the audience is that in 1942 Isolationism is no longer a practical policy. The US indeed did land in North Africa no long thereafter. This is not to suggest there is a causal relation. It is to indicate that the film industry has been telling, sometimes foretelling, at other times supporting, the American story. This frequently was the retelling of that archetype Western movie as you can see today in Troy or the movie on the Crusades. <br /> <br />Regardless of your motivation: you have to see this movie  <br />
0375405380|4.0|\\"El poder del perro\\"; The Power of the Dog. This novel delivers a healthy dose of reality, shadowing drug enforcement agencies, from the poppy fields of South America to the Mexican border. Laced with the politics of self-deception and political agendas, much goes unreported and unacknowledged as the US continues indefensible relationships with despots who perpetuate the violence of a drug-related economy.<br /><br />Against this background, one figure traces the advances of the drug economy. Since Operation Condor in Sinaloa in 1975, Art Keller has been tracking the drug industry's recurring faces. A Company Man, Keller is one of the \\"lost, the lonely, the cultural misfits with a foot in two worlds and a place in neither, half-Anglo and Half-Mexican\\". North American fire power and munitions meet South American business-as-usual, a disheartening mix of military power in the hands of the politically untouchable who decimate the country's economy in pursuit of profit. Keller pursues one small corner of this world, but he does so doggedly, revealing the complicated infrastructure and government involvement along the US-Mexican border.<br /><br />Keller is infected with guilt; he once was duped by the man who is now a key player, Miguel Angel Barrera. But Keller handles most of his business outside of the purview of the government agencies, a lethal alphabet soup of DEA, FBI and ATF, all committed to keeping a lid on the current problems. Art believes all Third World slums are the same, \\"the same mud or dust, depending on climate or season, the same smells of charcoal stoves and open sewers...malnourished kids with distended bellies and big eyes\\".  At least in Guadalajara, the middle class softens the edge between rich and poor. Not so in the South American countries, reduced to abject poverty and a tiny percentage of ultra-rich. South America is a killing ground, where the poor are slaughtered with impunity.<br /><br />Following the corruption endemic to the drug trade, from Operation Condor in Sinaloa in1975, Guadalajara in 1984, El Salvador in 1985, Mexico and NAFTA in 1992 through the late nineties, is like descending the levels of Hell, each more complicated and fraught with moral indictments, the exorbitant cost of the lesser of two evils, where moral ambiguity becomes the coin of the realm. Art Keller's personal journey, navigating this particular nightmare, illustrates how deeply flawed is the attempt to control illegal substances.<br /><br />This kind of fiction serves a dual purpose: it entertains and informs. While Winslow writes a fascinating fiction of drug trafficking and those it touches so intimately, he also exposes the agencies who have failed to control the uncontrollable, yielding a massacre of thousands in the name of profit, a system of bribery and corruption so endemic that each layer only reveals another, a mix of murderers and drug lords who act with impunity to protect a way of life. In a blistering indictment of the War on Drugs, American support of Third World guerillas financed by the illegal narcotics trade and the easy greed of officials who sell their accommodation to the highest bidder, Winslow spins a powerful yarn that is both informative and disturbing: \\"The hardest thing in the world isn't to refrain from committing an evil, it's to stand up and stop one.\\" Luan Gaines/2005.rug trade, from Operation Condor in Sinaloa in1975, Guadalajara in 1984, El Salvador in 1985, Mexico and NAFTA in 1992 through the late nineties, is like descending the levels of Hell, each more complicated and fraught with moral indictments, the exorbitant cost of the lesser of two evils, where moral ambiguity becomes the coin of the realm.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|(4 & 1/2 stars)  A few weeks ago when I first saw the excellent video for \\"Best of You,\\" the great debut single from In Your Honor, I was sure the album would also be terrific.  And it is.  I like the \\"split album\\" concept - one disc hot and the other cool.  \\"Best of You\\" is just an amazingly good song, in the \\"powerfully melodic\\" tradition of such previous Foo masterpieces as \\"Times Like These\\" and \\"Monkey Wrench.\\"  \\"Best\\" and other solid tunes on the first disc make it the equal of other hard-rocking Foo albums of the past.  But the 2nd disc is the real revelation.  We've certainly seen that Grohl and band can make some memorable slower music, as fans of the TV show \\"Ed\\" could attest.  A whole CD of softer material is an interesting move - and apparently a controversial one too.  (In this respect, Grohl can't win -- people bashed him for going Heavy Metal on the Probot CD; now he is getting complaints about slowing down for this album's 2nd CD!)  New songs such as \\"Still\\" and \\"Another Round\\" are also strong, but it's a quiet strength.  I would still like to hear \\"loud\\" versions of new songs like \\"What If I Do?\\" - but that may be something for another day.  Meanwhile, I will accept and enjoy these two CDs for what they are - my favorite album so far this year!
B000001ESP|5.0|One of their better albums- but heck, you need them all, its rush. Camera Eye, and Limelight, my favs. Must OWN! Rush rules!!
0790731002|2.0|I've always loved Batman, ever since i was a kid. The first two were great, but this one really just started the cancer that almost destroyed the franchise. Subbing in for Micheal Keaton, who was great, is Val Kilmer. Kilmer is OK as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne, he's got the personality of a fence post. A lot of times it looked like he was being forced into this role. This was the beginning of Batman losing his fear striking image. With Keaton, he had a presence as Batman that would understandibly make criminals affraid. Kilmer pretty much makes Batman seem like a wrench in the gear. Chris O'Donnell was iffy as Robin, he didn't make Robin seem queer, but also didn't act too well. The villians make up for some of the only quality in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones really brought edge to Two-Face that i didn't think would happen. Jim Carrey was pretty much made for this role as the Riddler. Sadly, thats all that was good with this movie. There are too many obvious plot mistakes. One being that Schumacher claims that Harvey Dent (Two-Face) killed Wayne's parents, while in the first movie, Joker does the killing. For some reason Schumacher turns Dent from a cold-blooded killer to a well-respected lawyer. Another hole is that, in the first movie, Dent was black, yet years later he's white? I thought only Micheal Jackson could do that. Batman Forever relies too much on sound and special effects than actual quality. I wouldn't really reccommend this, just see the first two and then the new one.
B000002G6J|5.0|Rio de Janeiro is one of the most striking destinations on the Pacific Ocean. Its exotic landscapes are as easily recognizable as anywhere I can think of. Some of the images that come to mind are: sailboats, cigars, warm golden sunsets, the ocean, good wine, great seafood, gentle wind, clean air, relaxing nightlife, the `70s, and beautiful people. With that short list alone, it's easy to see how Brazil could be responsible for some of the most gorgeous music in the history of the modern world. Bossa Nova, specifically, is the most globally recognizable form of music to come out of Brazil, and is partially accountable for a lot of the smooth elements in today's jazz and easy listening genres. <br /> <br />Antonio Carlos Jobim is the artist primarily responsible for the Bossa Nova movement, and his album Wave is his unequivocal masterpiece. Outside of the famous Astrud Gilberto & Stan Getz song, \\"Girl from Ipanema,\\" no other song/album is as representative to the aesthetic of Bossa Nova music as Wave. Nothing else comes close to matching the heart-wrenching sophistication of the songs within this short 32-minute gem. <br /> <br />For the most part, it's damn near impossible to think negative thoughts under the influence of Wave. The approach of the album is utterly amazing and light-hearted, while concurrently upbeat and erotic. It contains three basic elements; guitar, piano, and orchestration. Jobim contributes the first two, while longtime collaborator/arranger/conductor Claus Ogerman (along with Deodato, Ron Carter, and others) provides the delicate background orchestrations that lift this album to immeasurable heights. <br /> <br />Wave is primarily an instrumental album, with the only exception of \\"Lamento,\\" where we briefly hear Jobim sing with his raspy and sultry voice. Every song on the album is stylistically similar, but creates an overall mood that could, or should, last for much longer than it does here. Luckily, a few years after the release of Wave, Jobim released another album somewhat similar in style, called Tide. His first album, The Composer of Desafinado, Plays isn't too shabby of a recording either. Take any combination of these together and you'll have what could be one of the most peaceful music experiences ever. With Wave, in particular, you'll find repeated listening will become a must. <br /> <br />Since music (specifically pop and rock) is becoming stale these days, why not search for something a little more artistic and meditative on the soul? Bossa Nova, while gaining much respect and recognition over the past two decades, is still one of the most overlooked genres of music around; especially by our generation. But that's no fault of ours, because it's certainly not promoted in any way. Ultimately, Wave is an album you only need to hear once before it will spark an interest that will uncover an endless list of albums by some of the world's most forgotten artists. Wave is the quintessential Bossa Nova album, and, consequently, remains one of the best albums I've discovered in the recent years.
B00097A5I6|5.0|It's a fantastic album. The best album since What's the history morning glory. Liam have written 3 songs, and \\"guess God thinks I'm Abel\\" is awesome!
0790729652|5.0|I watched this movie enough as a kid to wear the film on the VHS thin. Recently i watched it again, to actually understand what was going on. This Batman was probably the best of the original four by far. Many people weren't fans of how dark it was, but the darkness is neccessary to add to the story. Batman is supposed to strike fear in the hearts of criminals, and this movie pulled that off. Keaton was suprisingly good, able to pull off the quiet and solitary Bruce Wayne, while still nailing the intense and dark Batman. Right away you can tell that Joker was a role Nicholson was born for. He had everything down perfectly, even the insane laugh. This is one of the few Batmans that relied more on plot than visual and sound effects. This is probably my favorite yet, and hopefully the new one is even better.
0440211727|5.0|Grisham has written a very thought provoking book dealing with  two completely different subjects-namely Law and Justice.A lawyer once told me that the public often confuses Law and Justice.In simple terms ,Law is what the government makes and is written in the \\"books\\".Justice is what results from a court of the people.In this book,there is no doubt that the father killed the two who performed such horrible acts on his daughter.It was also evident that he felt that justice would not be done.No doubt,the foundation of a society is its Laws and Justice.Along with these concepts ,in a free society,the people must have faith that their trust in the system is going to be well founded. When this trust is no longer warranted because of abuses;society fails.In this story we see a different thing.It is not a matter of \\"taking the Law into one's own hand\\";this is a case of \\"taking Justice in one's own hands.\\"<br /><br /> Several reviewers have commented on whether the book or the movie is better.I have to go with the movie.Other examples of this,in my opinion would be 'Mississippi Burning',and especially 'Gone With the Wind'.'Tora,Tora,Tora','The Bridge on the River Kwai','High Noon',also come to mind.As a matter of fact,I am hard pressed to think of a book that beats the movie.I guess that's because of all the sound and visual effects that film makers have at their disposal to add to the story.<br /><br /> As I am writing this review,it's interesting to note that a trial is just getting underway of Edgar Ray Killen in the murder of 3 civil rights activists which took place 41 years ago in Mississippi.Once again, will Justice be done and more important will Justice be seen to be done.<br /><br />  This book and movie is one of the best \\"trial\\"stories I've come across.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I remember seeing this movie in 1999 in theaters as a twelve-year-old.  At that time I thought it was an awesome movie.  It had great special effects and lots of action sequences.  Everything else I virtually ignored.    Now I look back on the movie and realize how God-awful some parts actually are.  My first complaint with the movie is all those idiotic little gags they pulled (that guy whose pod flew apart in the podrace scene, the droid that was sucked into an engine).  My second problem with the movie was the actor who played Anakin Skywalker.  I don't care how young he was at the time, he did a horrible job in this movie.  My third problem with this movie is the presence of Gungans.  Not just Jar Jar...ALL the Gungans, Jar Jar was just the most irritating of them.  The movie would've been better if they weren't in it for comic relief because even as a sixth-grader I was a little cheesed out by lines like \\"Yousa in big doo-doo now!\\" and Jar Jar's constant screw-ups.  I was also really annoyed by the fact that Darth Maul's face was splattered everywhere, but he was barely in the movie (and barely had any lines when he WAS on camera).  His big scene was obviously the lightsaber battle between him and Qui Gon and Obi Wan, which brings me to the point that I personally felt that both Darth Maul and Qui Gon were just killed off poorly.  What I mean is that their deaths felt a little rushed and not thought out well, kind of like the writers just got lazy so they killed them both off instead of figuring some other way to work them into the trilogy's plot, which I'm almost sure is what happened.    There were a lot of things I did like about the movie:  the aforementioned special effects are one thing, and the well coreographed fight scenes were another.  The fight scenes in particular overshadow those of the original trilogy.  They look a lot more authentic.  And I also think that a lot of really good music was written for this movie as well.  The music was definitelyone of my favorite things about this movie.  I liked Darth Maul and thought he showed a lot of promise, but the writers didn't do nearly enough with him, so he ended up as an almost totally wasted character.    The rest of this movie was ok.  There were parts where acting wasn't really that good...mostly because of Jake Lloyd, but not always.  There were a few characters who could've been better or featured more prominently, but other than that it was just ok.    Basically, this movie is pretty bland in some parts and awesome in others which evens it out to be pretty mediocre.
0790730960|4.0|When Micheal Keaton and Tim Burton left the Batman franchise, they took the quality with them. Luckily, they gave us one more Batman before they left. This film brings back the darkness and strength that Batman was supposed to have. Keaton returns, successfully pulling off the double personality role of Wayne and Batman. Danny DeVito is really the only person that could really pull off the Penguin, having that twisted creepiness and nailing the voice perfectly. I wasn't sure if Michelle Pfieffer would be able to get Catwoman, but i was wrong. She was very good, throwing in enough puns to make due, and not overdoing it (Arnold as Freeze). Burton brings back that grim and dark look to Gotham with a great plot that you don't see in sequals that often. This is the best of the sequals, from this point on, Batman slowly died in quality.
B000957O82|4.0|I really suprised to see such a wonderful performance from Will Smith. It is a very good comedy. Hitch (Will Smith) is a date doctor and gets always lousy guys who wants very hot and young ladies. He helps them to achieve their objective. But the last client was the guffiest accountant (Kevin James) and he wants inaccessible beauty named Allegra (Amber Valetta). They start to work together and somehow miracle happens. It is a comedy that you can watch it many times and laugh again and again.
0440236738|5.0|I dare you to find more twists than in this book!  Once again, great characters and an interesting plots that keeps you guessing and reguessing all the way.  Just when you think that Coben has revealed what's been going on, something else happens again...and then again.  Such a fast read, this one will take no time to finish.  Highly recommended along with Tell No One.
B000069HJN|4.0|This is the last great Supertramp album. I loved Breakfast, Paris, Crime of the Century. When this album came out, many people felt it was all over without Hodgson. However, this album was a statement that the band could continue and do it right, right bloody well right. This cd has some great songs namely the title tune which is truly one of Supertramp's most ambitious compositions. The other songs are fine as well namely Cannonball with wonderful instrumental work. If they would have continued along this path, I would have been happy. Yet, since this cd they have put out jazz lite tuneless heaps of garbage. Let's be honest superfans, this cd is leaps and bounds better than anything they have put out since. And it is a shame because this album reveals this band had great potential even without the wonderful Hodgson. And to those out there who don't feel as though this band is progressive, just listen to this gem. Yes I'm talking about pebozo a.k.a. pedroza, daniel. I'm still waiting for Davies and the gang to go back to this aggressive, progressive approach....
0515125024|4.0|yes, yes, yes, we know, this book (like the last) starts out with a big coincidence.  But it's a coincidence that starts a great story all the way.  Child improves with this book and makes you love Reacher more and more with each page.  Very recommended series so start reading.  Can't put book down!
B0006L16N8|3.0|NB: I had limited time to submit this review, hence, it won't be as indepth or explanatory as wanted.  <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of Coldplay's. i loved 'Parachutes' and 'A Rush Of Blood to the Head' but this album, personally i think is their worst.  <br /> <br />In short, it's partly boring, partly repititive and partly tedious. I left it to play and found myself skipping tracks about 1 minute. (For this review i listened to it fully) <br /> <br />The spark and brilliance of 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' just wasn't there for me this time. By the way, that's my favourite Coldplay album. I suggest if your new to Coldplay to buy that album instead.  <br /> <br />Moving on... Despite that, the lyrics were quite excellent in true Chris Martin style. Lyrically, he never seems to fail. True genious in that sense.  <br /> <br />The album as a whole felt like a candle on the verge of fading out. There would be about 3 slow, boring, drawn out songs then 1 or 2 songs which would rekindle it eg: \\"X&Y\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" in the middle there conjoining the two 'sides' X & Y. <br /> <br />All in all. For the $AU 20 i payed for it, i thought it was only worth about $10 minus the hype and anticipation. <br /> <br />Liked/Above par: <br />\\"Fix You\\"  <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\" (would of fitted in really well in A Rush of Blood...) <br />\\"Square One\\" <br />\\"X&Y\\" <br /> <br />Inbetween/Par: <br />\\"Low\\" <br />\\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" <br />\\"'Til Kingdom\\" <br />\\"The Hardest Part\\" <br /> <br />Disliked/Below par: <br />\\"What If\\" <br />\\"White Shadows\\" (great beat but to me felt like mismatched lyrics & timing <br />\\"Talk\\" <br />\\"Twisted Logic\\" <br />\\"A Message\\" (like White Shadows it's only good during the chorus)
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have all 3 albums, this most recent one is a little adventurous but they come back before they lose it, you can tell they are testing other styles, but they still manage to retain what makes them coldplay.Another inspiring album, perfect for just listening to alone.Even if you didnt like the first album, i suspect one may like this, its different enough for non listeners to tune into.The standout song in my mind is \\"square one.\\" enjoy
0446613444|4.0|\\"The black ice\\" is the second book in the Harry Bosch series, following \\"The black echo\\". Harry Bosch is still the same, lonely, bitter, determined and not giving a damn about what his superiors think. The plot of the book, however, is not as strong as in \\"The black echo\\". Connelly continues to develop his main character, and that's good, because Bosch can be read like a real person, full of flaws and weaknesses, but also with an incredible sense of duty.<br /><br />This time, the apparent suicide of a fellow policeman triggers an investigation that leads to a powerful new drug, secrets from the past, and an investigation that will take Bosch to the mexican border, amid sterile insects and bullfights. Yes, it seems strange, but the book is solid... until a certain point. Similar to what happened in \\"The poet\\", the final \\"explanation\\" of the whole case is not very believable, and depends on too many assumptions to work. Anyway, I see \\"The black ice\\" as a good oportunity to know how Bosch live and work a little further.<br /><br />I begun reading \\"The concrete blonde\\" as soon as I finished \\"The black ice\\" and, already halfway thorugh it, I can see it's more interesting then the second one. Like other reviewers stated, \\"The black ice\\" may be seen as a bridge between the first and the third book in the series.<br /><br />Grade 7.2/10

B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is a great addition to the Tim Burton Batman films and in my opinion it slightly surpasses those, but not by much. Let me just get the two negatives I have of the film off my back to begin with. The fight scenes were way too choppy to the point of not being able to tell who was hitting who and it lacks the comic book fun of the first two Batman films (I know it is suppose to be more realistic). Now the great things... Christian Bale shines as Bruce Wayne/Batman proving he is a star on the rise. Check him out in The Machinist where he went from 184 pounds to a skeletal 121 pounds. After he shot that film, Bale had to gain back his original weight and put on around 30 pounds (close to 100 lbs. in only 5 months) of bulk to play Batman. That is one dedicated actor if I do say so myself and I liked him just as much as Keaton in the role because he had the physical build (something Keaton lacked) to go along with the good acting chops to play Batman. The supporting cast is great as well, with Liam Neeson (very good here), Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman being the standouts. The villians are almost side characters in the story, which is drastically different from Burton's films where the bad guys were on screen as much as Batman was. I like how they used very little CGI and relied on real stunts and explosions. The score was well done as well, even though there was no great theme like in the Danny Elfman soundtracks. I am a fan of Burton's Batmobile design, but this one is just as cool in a more realistic way. Some people actually got up too quickly and missed the Joker reference at the end, so make sure you see the credits before leaving.
6305078564|5.0|My favorite book in the world, Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice, has come to life! I was so pleased with this miniseries. I was thrilled by the fact that everything nearly perfectly follows the book. Line for line, facial expression for facial expression, character for character. Excellent!
B000002UTT|4.0|Roxette has been dismissed as a stupid act. And I don't like their last Cds, but this one is beautiful and full of energy and there's genius all over it. Sleeping Single is one of those touching songs that always make you shed a tear even when you're dancing to it.<br /><br />The whole album rocks. The guitar playing is awesome for a pop song, and Marie's voice is really cool and has a lot of personality,<br /><br />Paint, Dressed for Success, Chances and Dangerous rock hard.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Clearly \\"The Lion King\\" is one of Disney's greatest stories, and one I loved when I saw it in the theaters and my son loves nowadays when he watches it time and again. Solid story line and music, compelling characters, beautiful imagery: it's pretty much got it all. For purists, the DVD contains the original untouched movie. For those open to new things, there's an extra song slapped in (\\"The Morning Report\\") which flows seamlessly into the plot.<br /><br />Two negatives only: except for a handful of segments on animals a-la-Animal Channel, that don't seem to justify a second disc in their own right, this feels more like a single DVD movie stretched to turn it into a double-DVD. Another negative is the fact that the navigation for both discs is far from intuitive (example: \\"Grasslands\\" in the first one is the name given to a section that contains a featurette on \\"The Morning Report\\" and an interactive game).<br /><br />In spite of the negatives, after you learn your 'way around' the first DVD, what you have is a beautiful movie that you will treasure along Disney's biggest classics, and a clear five-star DVD in its own right.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked's original broadway cast album boasts an all-star cast, Tony-award winning Idina Menzel, Tony-award winning Kristin Chenoweth, Tony-award winning Norbert Leo Butz, Tony-award winning Joel Grey. The music is absolutely spectacular and Stephen Schwartz has done it again, created one of the most outstanding musicals in Broadway history. Wicked's music is exciting, up-beat, funny, beautiful, and complex. Outstanding scores such as Defying Gravity and Dancing Through Life will be forever remembered. The song, For Good, is sang so beautifully and so nationally recognized that it has been song all over the country as a graduation song. Many people have commented on Wicked's loss of the Best Musical Tony, but as many critics have said, Wicked did not need the Best Musical Tony while Avenue Q needed it to stay on Broadway. Wicked will be a long-lasting musical, forever remaining in history, compared to the likes of Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Lion King, and Miss Saigon. This musical is for all age groups and is the first musical to sweep the young generation since Rent. I suggest this musical to all.
B0007P3582|1.0|I know by now everyone is tired of buck teeth 50 cent.He is playing his self out. I was excited the day this album came out because i LIKED his first one. This album here is garbage. I dont see how in the heck candyshop went to number 1 on the billboard charts. Olivia's bad vocals messed up the song. She can't sing worth of crap. Just A lil bit is pacing up the charts. I dont see how. These songs are lame. In my hood and ski mask way are the only decent tracks. I dont even see how his albums sell so much. 50 U IS THE WORST MC EVER
B000001YOW|5.0|I was introduced to Porcupine Tree when In Absentia came out, as is probably the same with a lot of people. However, I had heard their reputation for more space-rock leanings on past albums. For no particular reason, I chose to buy Signify first.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with what I heard when I listened to it. It still has some of the rock drive found on In Absentia, but unlike today's prog standards such as Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree is much more reserved and mature. Don't get me wrong, I love Dream Theater, and this isn't a review of Dream Theater, but I like it when bands know that less is more.<br /><br />Steve Wilson knows very well when less is more on this record. A lot of it is quite ambient in nature. Songs like \\"Intermediate Jesus\\" and \\"Light Mass Prayers\\" are pretty much all instrumental. The former is a sort of dazed-and-confused sounding jam that primarily features the bassist on what sounds like a fretless electric. The latter is a frightening wash of synth. Other layed back sounds come in the form of \\"Every Home Is Wired,\\" which borrows heavily from Pink Floyd. From out of left field comes \\"Idiot Prayer,\\" a steady techno beat with a sort of agressive synth riff persisting throughout.<br /><br />The other side of the album is the quiet-to-loud rock song. Still, there's plenty of reverb and synth during these songs to give them a more ambient feel than Porcupine Tree's later albums. My personal favorite on this album is \\"Sleep of No Dreaming,\\" which is a very moody, intense song with a jazz feel, distinct lead guitar in the chorus and a driving bass synth. Other songs in this vein include \\"Sever\\" and \\"Waiting\\" (both phases.)<br /><br />There's really no reason for you not to buy this save lack of funding. If you're like me and heard In Absentia first, don't expect this to sound like it, and you'll do just fine.
0066620996|1.0|This book would embarrass the average first grader! Its so superficial its depth has to be measured in microns.  It proves that lots of idiots went to great schools.
B0002M3V0C|5.0|I am an American, and I am currently over in Germany right now, and purchased the CD. The CD is 5 stars, but it makes me mad because when I tried to import the CD into iTunes it wouldn't work. I know a fair amount about computers and nothing I tried worked. If you are just going to listen to it in your car...BUY IT. If you like Maroon 5, you will love this CD.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Yeah, I'm a chick and yeah, I love DT. I have also been listening to Yes, ELP and Black Sabbath since I was 10. That being said, I am very disappointed in the latest release from DT. I have been a fan since I woke up on the couch at 1 a.m. to MTV's Headbanger's Ball and there was the DT video of \\"Pull me Under\\". I went out the next day and bought Images and Words and was blown away by the songs and the musicianship. I have turned a lot of friends on to DT over the years, including people that weren't even into metal. It's hard not to respect such amazing musicians no matter what kind of music you're into.  <br /> <br />So what does all that have to do with the new release? Well, exactly, where is the song writing? Where is the musicianship? As I was listening to this disc, I found myself fast forwarding through the songs hoping for something, ANYTHING interesting. I actually said to myself out loud, \\"Did they run out of ideas?\\" Oh sure, Panic Attack and Never Enough are typical shredding DT metal but they sound like everything else they've ever done and nothing new, fresh or interesting.  <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting another masterpiece like 6 Degrees (my personal favorite) nor was I expecting another Train of Thought but I hoping for a lot more than the mediocre songs on this disc. I don't feel that this is the end of DT or that they've lost it, just that maybe this was a more personal and experimental disc and that they will come back, stronger than ever on their next one. Rock on Dudes, I'll always love ya! <br />
B000001FO4|5.0|Like any good thing, with Cinderella you didn't know what you got til' they went away .. This album is really a classic of the hair bands period a music period that I miss so much. It is splendid music what Tom Keifer and the guys produced for this second album of theirs. It is absolute their best. It is full of blues anthemic songs, fantastic pop metal songs, and tender ballads (like the wonderful You don't know what or the exceptional title track minor blues ... ). I really started to enjoy this album only some time later after its release date because it was more mature musically than what I was at the period. Nevertheless it grew on me constantly and now it is surely one of the best hair metal album of the period in my opinion. It is a really powerful album that speaks to the hearts. Mine is not a nostalgic review. This album is really something that deserves to be listened still today and kept as a treasure. No matter the goofy name of the band. It was a hell of a band at least when the released this gem. I wasn't aware of their level until time passed. As it always is ... You don't know what you got 'til its gone.
0446310786|5.0|This novel speaks with cultural clarity of the attitudes and actions of a large portion of the US, some of which still persist today. The point of the novel is to explore the awakening of a child's mind in understanding the adult world and being guided on the truth and deceptions of humanity by a pivotal and herioc parental figure. Slowly paced, it beautifully reflects the dangerous pace of rotting minds and attitudes in the depression era, the story of Tom Robinson's court case and treatment by the majority of the Townsfolk is beautifully reflected by the Children's treament of and fascination with, Boo Radley. The Finch's are a fine family and you will ache for a Father like Atticus. A deeply important and highly daring Novel and a must read for school age children.<br /><br /> Almost like an Anne Frank diary of the deep south.
B00008BXJG|5.0|bon scott is by far the best AC/DC singer and one of the best rock singers ever. combine him with the younbg brothers and you have some of the best rock albums ever. this review is titled best of the best because of the two(or technically three) AC/DC singers. Bon scott is the best. and this album is the best of the albums in his era. This is one of the few albums that can be played through with not a single song that is not great. only a few rock albums have reached this zenith (back in black, led zepplin II, high voltage, kill em all to name a few)  <br />  <br />1. Highway to Hell (11/10): one of the best rock songs of all times and definetally the best on this album.  <br />2. Girls got Rythm (9/10): great beat, fast paced, great singing on both Bon and the bands part.  <br />3. Walk all over you (9/10): nice guitar work and a excelent choras make this song a essencial part of the album.  <br />4. Touch too much (10/10): awesome song, face paced, great lyrics.  <br />5. Beating around the bush (8.5/10): great riff, but but not the best lyrics bring this one into the \\"8\\" range. still a great song.  <br />6. shot down in flames (10/10): great lyrics, singing, guitar. a classic.  <br />7. Get it hot (8.5/10): nothing to special about this song, mostly a filler to in between shot down in flames and if you want blood. still an excelent song.  <br />8. if you want blood(you got it) (10/10) a hard-core rocker from begging to end. awesome.  <br />9. love hungry man (7/10): by far the weakest song on this album. i just can't get into it as much as the others. still, not a song to be skipped.  <br />10. Night prowler (10/10) excelent song, the perfect end to the cd. great riffs, singing chorus.( by the way, if any of you are wondering. the words that bon scott says at the song are \\"shazbo nano nano\\" a phrase from the show \\"mork and mindy.\\")  <br /> <br />total score (93/100) an \\"A\\" in all acounts. if (god forbid) you don't own this album, get it at once. whether you are an AC/DC fan, a fan of rock or a fan of music, Highway to hell is a purchase you will never regret.
0060589272|2.0|After having read \\"The Alchemist,\\" \\"Veronika Decides to Die,\\" and \\"By the River Piedra,\\" I must say that I was rather disappointed by Paulo Coelho's latest \\"Eleven Minutes\\". All of his usual themes about adventure, living and loving fully are reiterated, but without new creative fire to give them ingenuity--they have become hackneyed. Yes, he does flesh out more fully his view of the sacred nature of sex and its possibility to become a divine experience for an individual or a couple, but he does it at a literary expense.  <br />His characters are not believable, but are thin guises for Coelho's communication of his thoughts on the human condition. His attempts at irony are a bit too contrived, he rather mocks his readership with their jejune quality. And by this time as a Coelho fan you know that the ending will only bring an ending that resolves all dilemmas and gives one an uplifted view on life.  <br />I am not necessarily saying that these sorts of resolutions are to be always criticized; indeed, the feel-good component of his work is what has led me back to him so frequently. However, when dealing with sex and prostitution and sadism, I think it is perhaps irresponsible of Coelho to make so light of these issues. His protagonist, a Brazilian sex workers named Maria emerges from her encounters with whips and countless sexual clients unscathed and even ebulliently instilled with love of life. How many prostitutes in a foreign land would be able to waltz out of a novel and proclaim themselves so free?
B0000028RR|5.0|I was mainly a grunge-fanatic back in the early 90s, so I had never really caught on to what Rage Against the Machine was really like. All I knew from them back in '92 was their hit single \\"Killing In The Name\\".  <br /> <br />Recenetly, I decided to give this album a listen, and was stunned at what they were like. Every song on this album had a powerful message ingrained into it somewhere, and it always came out as an \\"in your face\\" type of manner. Zack De La Rocha has an excellent voice for this type of music, it is loud and sounds powerful when he screams his messages (Like in \\"Freedom\\" at the very end when he yells it piercingly loud). <br /> <br />The guitar work in this album is something I had never heard before, it was almost like a DJ Turntable mixing studio some how build into a guitar. The sounds were fascinating and made for a great melody. The bassist carries a great supporting role and songs like \\"Bullet In The Head\\" and \\"Bombtrack\\" exemplify his work. The drummer is very crisp, and most of his beats would just make you dance and mosh to his dynamic rhythm.  <br /> <br />I wished I would have known more about these guys when I was into the grunge movement. Had grunge never come, I think that these guys would have started a revolution in their own right. I'm very surprised they did not become even more famous then they already were.
B000069HK2|5.0|Why does everyone insist that band's stick to a strict genre? Why must they be put in a category and be paid out if they attempt anything else? Music is about experimenting and enjoyment, who cares if it's pop or rock or whatever if people like it. <br /> <br />I personally really like The Used, sometimes I don't quite understand their lyrics but the songs all do different things for me. They can be calming, or make me feel better when I'm really angry. I love the diversity of their albums.. and I love Bert's voice, whether he's screaming or not! <br /> <br />1. Maybe Memories ~ 4/5 ~ bit of screaming, I can't understand it as much as others. <br />2. The Taste Of Ink ~ 5/5 ~ addictive song! <br />3. Bulimic ~ 5/5 ~ makes me feel better.. goodbye to you too! :( <br />4. Say Days Ago ~ 5/5  <br />5. Poetic Tragedy ~ 3/5 ~ it's good just not as good as the others. <br />6. Buried Myself Alive ~ 5/5 ~ another song that makes me feel better! <br />7. A Box Full Of Sharp Objects ~ 5/5 ~ my second fave song on the album! <br />8. Blue And Yellow ~ 5/5 beautifully different, but I love it! <br />9. Greener With The Scenery ~ 4/5 <br />10. Noise And Kisses ~ 4/5 ~ softer, but still good. <br />11. On My Own ~ 5/5 ~ this one makes me sad... it's pretty <br />12. Pieces Mended ~ 5/5 <br /> <br />Not many poorly rated tracks huh? Compare that to the one hit wonder albums!
B000003TA4|1.0|Is the music world blind to how phony Nevermind and Nirvana were? Or how about deaf? Nobody with a set of working ears could think Nirvana is even close to one of the best bands of all time. Kurt Cobain made millions off complaining about how he hated fame, and yet reveled in all the money it (and all you fans) gave him. For Nevermind Butch Vig spliced Kurt's best vocal takes and pasted them together to create \\"whole\\" songs. This is the way bands that Kurt hated produced their songs. Complete songs of \\"Lithium\\", \\"Teen Spirit\\", \\"Drain You\\", \\"In Bloom\\", and \\"On a Plain\\" were never done; over a period of several days, Vig had Kurt sing a few lines. Kurt would come to the studio the next day and sing some more lines. Vig then DIGITALLY cut & pasted everything together ala Frankenstein's monster. Everything about Nevermind was so methodical and calculated. It's nothing critics make it out to be. Passion isn't this slick, and it's not this planned. Nirvana had no passion. With every passing year, more and more people say this album has an ungodly signifigance to the music world. This couldn't be further from the truth though. I can't believe this album is being \\"preserved  for future generations\\" by the powers that be. It will give the most cliched and innacurate view possible of the 90's. But that's what the Library of Congress wants you to like, so why don't you all conform? Oh, you already have. How Punk.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I consider \\"Jaws\\" (1975), the first one which started it all, the BEST movie of ALL TIME!  And my favorite!  I first saw the film in DECEMBER 1975 after months of playing in theatres, and when I walked out of the theatre (Sunrise Mall, 2nd floor,  Massapequa, Nassau County, Long Island, NEW YORK)-theatre is no longer there, I had to walk around the mall a few times to get the \\"dizziness\\" out of me; I had NEVER been so involved and so effected by a movie before in my life (I was 15 years old).  I also like \\"Jaws 2\\" but not as much.  \\"Jaws 3\\" was so-so, and \\"Jaws 4\\" totally SUCKED!  (They should make that National Lampoon's \\"Jaws 5, People 0\\" now!)  I have even been to Martha's Vineyard where \\"JAWS\\" was filmed (in 1992)! I had to go since \\"JAWS\\" is my favorite, but will probably miss out on the 30th Anniversary celebration in the Vineyard this year!  I have EVERY edition of \\"JAWS\\" (EXCEPT the videotape!).  I have \\"JAWS\\" 5 times: 3 LD's (laserdiscs) and 2 DVD's:  regular edition of the movie on laserdisc in CLV, another edition laserdisc but in CAV, the BOX SET Special Edition on laserdisc which cost a \\"pretty penny\\"! (over $100 U.S. dollars), and \\"25th Anniversary of JAWS\\" DVD, and now yesterday, bought the \\"30th Anniversary of JAWS\\" DVD.  ALL in Widescreen / Letterbox!  This format is the BEST way to go, best way to watch a movie, especially with a 60-inch t.v. screen!  Fullscreen / Pan-and-Scan / Full Frame (FF) SUCKS!  If you're a die hard fan of movies, WS (Widescreen) is the best way!  That is the way the movie was presented in the movie theatre, and what the director had intended for people to see!  (As one person wrote once, talking about Fullscreen: FOOL Screen!  People like Fullscreens are fools!)  You can tell that I am a GIGANTIC FAN of \\"JAWS\\"!  And a big fan of Steven Spielberg!  I even have \\"DUEL\\", \\"1941\\", \\"E.T.\\" twice each, on laserdisc, and the special editions on DVD! And have many other Spielberg flicks on laserdisc and DVD (I met Spielberg in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles, California at the Academy Awards ceremony in March 1987 on the stage after the ceremony, and was able to converse with him; no one around; just me and him, and someone with him; he is short; I am 6 feet.  I even got to hold an Oscar that night!  Caught him while he was running up the steps onto the stage, and I said \\"Mr, Spielberg\\", he turned around, I shook his hand, and just told him that I think he is the greatest director and that he is my favorite, and to keep up the excellent work!  He said \\"Thanks\\"! Of course!)  Anyway, before the movie \\"JAWS\\", I used to swim WAY THE HELL OUT, until I could not see anybody on the shore (I did this when I was 12, 13 and 14 years old); after the movie came out, I won't swim out that far, the bottom of the sea (sand below) is not more than 8 feet below me, AND I have to swim -or have to be- around people!  BUT!  The movie made me become interested in sharks and the history of sharks and anything about sharks, even other movies about sharks, I will buy.  I am fanatic about sharks now!  And also with earthquakes!  Anyway, I know the \\"suits\\" (executives) want us to BUY,BUY,BUY every edition!  Usually I only buy one, say, with \\"THE GRUDGE\\": I bought Special edition ONLY because I had \\"JU-ON\\", so why buy the regular edition of \\"GRUDGE\\" when it is the same movie as the Japanese version?!  I am a sucker for \\"JAWS\\", and probably will buy the NEXT version, next Anniversary edition, and the next, and the next....  If you LOVE the film as I do, or do not have any versions from before, buy it!  (Even though I had the laserdisc with the FULL documentary, I still bought the newer version: has movie in Spanish.... know people who speak it, and a couple other extras, even though most extras were on last edition \\"the 25th\\".  I intend on keeping ALL my editions of \\"Jaws\\", and not selling!  Maybe collectibles one day!  I know I am one of the suckers, but what can I say!  This film WILL scare you!  The BEST (if you want to call it such) HORROR movie!  At least THE BEST Action / BEST Thriller / BEST Drama movie ever!  This movie \\"rocks\\", it is EXCELLENT, and THE BEST .... EVER!  And I will argue that point to the day I die!  Buy it!  (It is cheap, compared to editions in the past!)  Thank you very much!  And keep on .... chomping!   LOL    duh-duh,duh-duh....    Bye!  -PAUL   Wednesday, 15 June 2005 - 3:41 PM EST
B00063MBU8|1.0|I'm sorry, but i've had enough. Simple Plan's excessive publicity has left me with little recourse. I must write a bitter diatribe condemning this horrible band.  <br />    Simple Plan is the worst band in modern history. Still not getting any, huh simple plan? Well maybe that's because you produce the most trite, excessively maudlin songs in the history of the world. If Simple Plan \\"speaks to you\\", you are either without reasoning capacity, or you are five years old. The emotional wastelands that are the band's two recent singles are both crimes against humanity. Oh, and just for future reference, naming a song \\"untitled\\" doesn't make it artsy. Especially if you're like Simple PLan and you possess no songwriting abilities.  <br />   Anyone who gives this atrocious group credit for \\"breaking away\\" from their former pop-punk facade is blind. Their current, perverted brand of emo for 12-year-olds is quite possibly the most contrived crap i've ever heard. If I have to hear one more power ballad about no one understanding you because you're an emotionally retarded, pre-pubescent faux-punk, I'll die. If Simple Plan's tour bus exploded tomorrow, I can't say I would be saddened.
B00005JNJT|5.0|At the beginning of the movie, I was afraid about how Bruce Wayne become The BATMAN. But Christian Bale is since Michael Keaton, the only who can brought this legend come true. <br />  The screenplay is uncredible and very complete. You can forget everything you've seen before. BATMAN BEGINS is now the new reference in Super heroes movies. Spider-man, you don't have the lead anymore.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is one of the most darkly engrossing and disturbing films ever made. Robert DeNiro becomes Travis Bickle, a psychotic Vietnam veteran who is thoroughly disgusted with the urban decadence and decay all around him. His portrayal is astoundingly uncanny and personal, yet Travis still remains tantalizingly mysterious (I credit this aspect more to Scorsese's directing and Paul Schrader's story). To some degree, I believe every man can relate to Travis's experience. We have all felt the loneliness and isolation, we have all felt the sexual frustration, we have all felt the blood-boiling rage; and, of course, we have all wanted to own a small handgun that we could slide out of our sleeve on a rail so we could shoot a worthless pimp.    ***** Highly Recommended!
B00003CXTG|1.0|If not for the title you could have made this movie about anything because thats what it TRIED to be was everything to everyone and what it ends up being is over produced crap.  I had heard from everyone i knew that this movie had missed the mark but you cant funnly understand how far until you waste 3 hours viewing it.  Probably the longest 3 hours of my life, obsolutely awful.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The main reason I'm writing this review is to say that I had no problems what-so-ever ripping this CD to iTunes and my iPod.  If I hadn't of read the sticker on the front of the CD I would've never known it was \\"copy protected.\\"  So if you were like me and contemplating whether or not to buy this CD because of that reason, I wouldn't worry about it.  Especially if you have a Powerbook G4 since that's the only thing I can really confirm. <br /> <br />Regarding the album after 2 listens of Disc 1 and 3 of Disc 2 I'd say that it's a great record.  Stand out tracks on the acoustic CD are Virginia Moon and Razor.  On Disc 1 I really like End Over End.  While I prefer the acoustic disc over the electric I personally think the whole package is a 7/10 which is pretty damn good for new music.  I'm not too fond of Cold Day in the Sun with Taylor's vocals but it may grown on me.  I just feel as though it doesn't really mesh well with the other tracks.  But like I said, I've only listened to it 2 1/2 times.  I just really wanted to comment about the copy protection. <br /> <br />Peace.
B00068NVI4|4.0|The delay in this release can only mean one of two things; it will be great or not so great. To a Yes fan I can wait for whatever the outcome holds. I did see them in concert on this tour and Yes performed super. It was great to see the boys so up to snuff. This DVD will be a great memento of the 35th Anniversary Tour. The group's legacy is secure, and each individually will always be Icons of progressive rock music. <br />
B0009AM5JA|2.0|If you loved the first two, you'll eat up X&amp;Y with a spoon.  It offers an essentially identical sound as its predecessors.  Loved the emo of &quot;The Scientist&quot;?  Now we have &quot;Fix You&quot;.  Thought &quot;Clocks&quot; was brilliant?  Try out &quot;Speed of Sound&quot;.<br />However, to those who found Coldplay's past albums to be exhaustingly mediocre, X&amp;Y isn't even worth the download nor the flexing of your mouth's musscels as you cringe to lyrics about cutting down a tree.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have read many reviews on this movie, and before watching it, I have always been a fan of Michael Crowfold's phantom, and I love the book version a lot. Like many of you, I had my doubts before I watched the movie. But honestly, I just totally enjoy and love the movie version. One thing that may help you, to really enjoy this movie, you need to try to stop comparing it to other versions. I believe the producer/director/actors were trying to make something new here, and they certainly did it for me. As I was watching, I just developed a deep sympathy towards all three lead characters (Phantom, Christine and Roual). Before, I really only cared about Phantom. I think the cast and the script are both amazing. They made this love triangle the most memoriable one in film history in my opion! I especially enjoy the contrast between Gerard Butler (phantom) and Patrick Wilson (Roual): they differ in their body built, in their voice, in their acting style (GB more physical and expressive, PW more subtle)...yet they balance each other perfectly. Their contrast made me see Christine's delima clearly for the first time.  <br />Of course, if you simply cannot get over it (that it is not like the \\"right\\" version in your mind), I'll have to say just the music, set, and costumes alone in this movie will worth your every penny. The whole production team simply just put so much efforts into it that you will love it one way or the other (story lines, acting, music, special effects etc. You will have to watch the special feature on Disc2 to really appreciate the team effort!), and that's why it is a five stars and must-have in my opinion.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|great album!!! if you like good 70's rock, blues,and real grunge (not nirvana). you will love this album from start to finish. it's straight in your face rock and roll. if you like the stones, cramps, ramones, this one is for you. EAGLES OF DEATH METAL
B00006JLX4|5.0|What more can be said?  This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I bought it in Bethlehem, Pennsylvainia in the summer of '92 at Play it Again (on the advice of the mohawked store owner) and it truly changed my whole perception of music forever. <br /> <br />Oh yeah - reviewer Janitor X is a complete moron.  He also gave Pavement's Crooked Rain, the Pixies Doolittle, and Beck's Odelay albums one star.  Read his other reviews and you'll realize that he's one of those idiots you see driving a datsun pickup blaring Mastadon out the window.  It must be weird to be retarded but not know it, huh?  Sonic Youth loves Pavement by the way...
B00005Y7KX|2.0|I wasn't overly impressed with the English language CD of \\"Notre Dame de Paris,\\" but I thought I'd check out this DVD of the original French language production to see if something was lost in translation.  This doesn't seem to be the case.  Despite the language difference, the music comes across exactly the same, and judging from the English subtitles, the original French lyrics are just as bland as the translation.   There are, however, some attractive melodies in the score, and the cast sings them very well.  For the most part, though, the show is less like a musical, and more like a string of synthetic pop songs.  And there are many, many songs.  So many that they all begin to sound alike after about twenty minutes. Of course the music is one thing-- on the DVD we also get to SEE the show. It doesn't come across well.    The show is referred to as a \\"Musical Spectacle,\\" but aside from being on what appears to be a ridiculously enormous stage, there is nothing very spectacular about it.  The set consists mainly of a wall meant to suggest the side of the cathedral, and it remains on stage for the entire show, with just some props brought on here and there as needed.  Those looking for special effects and stagecraft wizardry should look elsewhere.  The production design is shockingly unimaginative.      By far, however, the worst flaws of \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\" are in the storytelling (and that includes the song lyrics).  Some problems are small, while others are impossible to overlook. One major miscalculation is the way Quasimodo, the hunchback himself, is treated as a secondary character. It takes awhile for him to even appear, and then he doesn't even get a song establishing him as the bell ringer until Act II.  What were the creators thinking?  Did they really think we cared more about the plight of Clopin, the king of the gypsies, or Frollo, who is made to be much too sympathetic?  What is Notre Dame without Quasimodo? Apparently, they decided he's just reallynot all that important to the story.     As a musical, this one pales in comparison to other pop operas like \\"Les Miserables\\" or \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" two shows \\"Notre Dame\\" seems to aspire to. While not perfect, those shows are dramatically engaging and have characters that interact with one another.  In \\"Notre Dame,\\" the characters appear on stage, often one after another and often alone, to either sing about their inner turmoil, or to tell us about action that has taken place already, apparently when we weren't looking. Instead of seeing why they have such passion, we hear about it. Instead of showing the drama, they tell us what's gone on. When the characters do happen to sing together, they seem to exist in their own separate little worlds.  It's all really sort of bizarre.  It's as if the creators have never seen a musical before.       Points about the characters are also repeated over and over to the point of mind-numbing.  Frollo sings endlessly about the torment of being a priest and in love with Esmeralda.  Quasimodo sings endlessly about loving Esmeralda and being ugly.  Phoebus sings endlessly about being torn by his love for Esmeralda.  And Esmeralda sings over and over about being a gypsy and having to deal with all these guys.  In the meantime, the ensemble comes on to sing and dance about how they're \\"outcasts\\" and this whole world is just a \\"den of thieves.\\"  There are seriously about five ensemble numbers that make that statement in almost exactly the same way.  When you combine all this with the repetitive music, things get pretty tedious well before Act II rolls around.    All in all, even though the show is pretty bad, I still kind of like that this DVD exists.  Far too few stage productions are put out on video, so even if it's not good, I like that it's available to be seen.  Unfortunately, the retail price on this DVD is pretty exorbitant.  So if you must see \\"Notre Dame de Paris,\\" you'll feel a lot better if you've just rented it.
0465011012|4.0|As a person who reads extensively on North Korea, I found this book to be an invaluable account of the terrifying world of the regime.  Not only does this book serve as an incredible resource which provides the world with intricate details and specific examples of the human rights crimes committed, but it is also a heart wrenching memoir that was well put together.  While there are some sentences in the books that take a second reading because of the odd sentence structure or unfamiliar sayings (probably because Kang's account has been translated from Korean to French and now to English), for the most part it flows well.  The way it is written has a great sense of immediacy, as if Kang is directly telling the story to the reader.   <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about North Korea's regime or to those greatly concerned with human rights.  While I have always been extremely concerned about human rights violations in North Korea, Kang's account gave me a greater reason to feel this way.  Despite having read other accounts of human rights atrocities in concentration camps and labor camps in other parts of the world, Kang's suffering never ceased to amaze and anger me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Both halves are equally as noteworthy in my opinion. \\"X\\" starts out with \\"Square One\\" and is the start of the more high-concept part of the album. \\"Y\\" begins with \\"Speed of Sound\\" and leads the way into the more subtle, but equally as formidable second half.  <br /> <br />There is a change of pace between the two parts. The songs on \\"Y\\" may not jump out at you immediately with the exception of \\"Speed of sound\\" and \\"Twisted Logic,\\" but it's not because they aren't good. They just require more attentive listening. Perhaps, they're just not meant to be the jump-up-and-down-grab-your-attention kind of songs. You have to process and absorb them differently.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a solid 3rd album. With the second, there's the question of the sophomore jinx, but I think the third can be equally as challenging. Coldplay had to live up to their own hype with this release and then some. But they passed by a mile. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that I wish they would have included the lyrics. I know, I know, they want us to interpret the meaning of the songs for ourselves. But I always like to follow along while I'm listening. The artwork is good. But I guess the exclusion of the lyrics allows me to just take it all in without picking it apart line by line, verse by verse and turning it into some sort of case study. Which judging by some reviews, some already have. So while I miss them, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the album. I'll definitely be playing this CD for awhile. <br />
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance in possiable one of the biggest let downs since lost in translation. This just like lost in translation was sworn up and down by movie critics everywhere to be such a great and powerful film. But on the contrary it might be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It starts off great and fast, a girl is killed in the first few minutes (which is always nice), and then the next hour or so you spend your time waiting and wanting something else to happen. And I mean anything at all. This movie is all build up, with little to no pay off. It has a interesting ending, but by then you have pracitically ripped all your hair out waiting for something to develope. And as we learned from star wars attack of the clones, a good ending does not make up for wasted hours watching a tedious storyline. This was a movie with such promise but just did not meet up to any of my expectations.
B00097A5I6|5.0|In a way it's something of a shame that in many people's eyes Oasis peaked early with only their second album, \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" (my own personal favorite Oasis CD and one of my all-time favorite albums) because it seems that every subsequent album they release is inevitably compared to it. They set the standard for themselves early on and in the opinion of a lot of fans they haven't quite maintained it. Whereas I agree with that to a certain extent, as a fan I personally don't believe there is any such thing as a bad Oasis album, just that some are better than others. \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\", however, is one of their best. It's rare for me to find an album where I like every single track on it, but it's even more seldom I find an album where I actually really look forward to hearing each song in turn.<br /><br />The Gallagher brothers have used the three years since their last album (the brilliant \\"Heathen Chemistry\\") to really gel together with Andy Bell and Gem Archer who joined the band in 2000, and the fact that each band member writes songs for the group appears to have raised the bar for some healthy songwriting rivalry. Therefore, a lot more thought seems to have gone into these songs. The opening track, \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" is a perfect start to the album, beginning with a wonderfully melodic, effortless intro before crashing into a great rock number. Liam's songwriting abilities alone have become much stronger and more mature with such gems on the new album as the rock-fueled \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\" and the beautiful \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" with a bridge towards the end that seems to sum up the resilience of Oasis - \\"No-one could break us/No-one could take us\\", before the song climaxes in a drum and guitar explosion for Liam to sing the last line. Two of my favorite songs on the album, Liam's \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" and Andy Bell's \\"Keep The Dream Alive\\" (surely a future single), together with Gem's \\"A Bell Will Ring\\", all sound like they neatly fit into the psychedelic guitar rock style adopted by the Beatles for their classic \\"Revolver\\" album, while Noel's clever \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" sounds truly Ray Davies inspired in the same vein as the Kinks' \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" and \\"Dedicated Follower Of Fashion\\", right down to the 60's-sounding guitar solo, and is more than worthy of being the band's next single . His new use of singing falsetto in parts of the song hit the mark perfectly. My favorite song on the album has to be \\"Let There Be Love\\" which is possibly one of the most beautiful songs Noel Gallagher has ever written. The simple melody and chord changes emphasized by echo-piano make this song sound astonishingly like a John Lennon composition in the mould of \\"Real Love\\" or \\"Jealous Guy\\". I disagree that Oasis are guilty of \\"ripping off\\" other bands like the Beatles and the Stones and T. Rex for melodies and riffs. Instead I see it as paying homage to the people that influenced them into making music in the first place, and very finely they do it too.<br /><br />Whenever a new Oasis album arrives on the scene it seems everyone is quick to either say \\"they're back on form\\" or \\"they still can't live up to \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\", instead of enjoying each new album for what it is. For better or worse, Oasis have moved on from the music they made in the mid-90's, perhaps inevitably so with the age and experience they've gained and the line-up changes they've encountered along the way. If you want \\"Definitely Maybe\\" or \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" then go and listen to \\"Definitely Maybe\\" or \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\".

B000957O7S|3.0|This was certainly a chick flick, but as far as chick flick's go this is the best one I have ever seen. With that said, this movie was not without its extremely boring and over dramitic moments. The film is broke into three parts, when will smiths character is on the screen with his love interest, when kevin james character is on the screen with his love interest, and when kevin james and will smith are together (will smith teaching kevin james how to get and keep his love interest). The differnce between these three parts is whenever kevin james is involved in the plot or movie you are going to laugh. Whenever will smith is alone with his love interest you are going to bored out of your mind. I found my only problem with this film was not enough kevin james. Now granted he shares alot of the movie with will smith, but will smith made me laugh maybe once or twice. Whereas kevin james made me laugh almost ever time he was on the screen. As far as the plot goes it is your typical chick flick cliche, the stars (smith and james) fall in love with two women, then something happens of course where smith and james love interests become broken hearted when certain secreats are found out, then the movie turns into whether or not smith and james will reunite and find love. Its like the plot from any adam sandler movie out there. But overall this is a good movie, and will keep you entertained the majority of the time.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I preordered this album on iTunes because I was promised that by doing so I would receive 2 exclusive B-side tracks.  Of course the day of release came and it auto downloaded it and charged my account, but the 2 tracks were nowhere to be found.  Foo Fighters should be ashamed to have any part in this scandle to sell more albums.  Plus you if you want to listen to the album seperatley on the ipod, you have to buy it twice.  Once for your cd car player and another time for your mp3/ipod player.  I thought it was supposed to be about the music, not just about ripping people off for more money.  I'm ashamed to call Dave Grohl a former seattlite.   I guess that's the Cali mentality but just because Courtney's hassling ya for money doesn't mean ya need to do it to your fans too.
B0007P0LPC|4.0|Having seen Swan Lake perfomed many times and having seen Fonteyn and Nureyev perform this ballet live many moons ago - I am a little biased.  It is wonderful to have a copy of this DVD in my collection - it is a little grainey due to the age of the performance no doubt, but the dancing is sublime.  Fonteyn is wonderful as Odette/Odile, such grace is rarely seen and Nureyev is in his prime - Nureyev always danced with passion and the pair always danced as if they were meant for each other.  There may well be better productions, but there are none to compare to Nureyev and Fonteyn as partners.  I actually preferred the ending of the Anthony Dowell Covent Garden performance - but Anthony Dowell was wooden and no Nureyev.  For the sake of seeing these dancers together in a classically danced ballet - I would highly recommend this.  It is also a joy to see Fonteyn again and not the anorexic dancers we tend to see today.
B00009ATKS|4.0|I never really believed that a single piece of plastic could be life-changing or life-defining. They once said that the Garden State Soundtrack was life-changing. But one listen and tsome songs are good to learn from and some are entertaining, but life-changing seemed over the top. When I heard of this band, I decided to tak a listen. Their latest single \\"Hunted By A Freak\\" seemed melancholy and dramatic, even with the muffled singing and the music video (the one where a man kidnaps animals and tosses them off of the apartment roof.) I thought the video was saddening and so was the music. I listened to more and never really got it until I bought the album. \\"Moses I Amn't\\" is sad, melancholy, and something you stare into the stars with. \\"Kids Will be Skeletons\\" with me is a song that sounds like a tune to play when you need to tell someone, \\"life is alright. Keep the faith.\\" \\"Killing All The Flies\\" is just enjoyable by nature, but seems like something that will shine pure light through your eyes. A type of song that says everything and one has an occasional rough edge to show. \\"Boring Machines Disturbs Sleep\\" induces a brightening dream sequence. \\"Ratts Of The Capital\\" ssounds like the perfect score for a spooky movie, but something that suits The Butterfly Effect. \\"Golden Porsche\\" is a song that sounds like love, hope and joy. \\"I Know You Are But What Am I?\\", featured on the wicker Park soundtrack, is more of a romantic depression track. \\"Stop Coming To My House\\" brings it all together for a real life-changing and life defining soundtrack to everyone's life. Did I mention that they didn't even have to use words for this? They go by emotion. But the truth is that is all it does: leave you with an impression that this album has a concept behind it, rather than it just be a list of songs, but nonetheless, the more understandable it becomes, the likely this album will make perfect sense. The album is better played on your heaphones than your speakers. <br />Rating: 7/10
B00003CXPD|5.0|Love Billy Elliot, this is a gritty, fast moving film, set in a tough mining town in the North of England.  Acting is superb without exception, and the music great.  Jamie Bell, is perfect for this role and is outstanding throughout.  The language is course, but depicts the tough outspoken people of the mining communites in England and is appropriate in the movie, however parents should be warned.  My teens watched the movie and loved it, they don't use bad language and I knew that watching this movie would not cause them to start.  I warned them of the language prior to watching, but that is all.  They really enjoyed it and have seen it again and again.  It is both funny and extremely moving - great job Mr Daldry.
B00012QM9K|3.0|One of the most pleasures of buying a collector's gift set or box set or anything is receiving multiple DVDs. they'd forgotten it when they designed this box set. there is only a CD soundtrack + a double-sided dual-layer dvd which could be 2 DVDs. I've always said, protecting Double sided DVDs is rather hard. even remove them from the case could mark a fingerprint on them and removing it even with a soft could make bunch of little scratches! then your DVD will not be like new anymore! <br />there is complains about the special features too. receiving two documentaries (90 min totall) as special features in a huge collector's box like this is rather dissapointing. <br />and at last, I think the design of the glass case is totally wrong cause if you put it erected on the shelf, contents could be damaged cause of weight. if you removie the contents, they are all individuals and not a bonus total case to put all contents in it. <br />this DVD set at this price is worth to buy, but don't expect to receive an spectacular DVD set!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I am a Jim Carrey fan but I saw this movie by chance...i knew nuthin about this movie and wound up at a friends house and she rented this movie... I sat and watched it feverently..I enjoyed it It was honest because everyone has had an instance of wanting to erase somthing or someone out of your mind....In this movie was an absolute map of what could happen if it was possible...were we doomed to make the same mistakes all over again. Its a movie for the thinkers....I have rented this movie over 3 times also GARDEN STATE!! Its a movie to enjoy..reflect and wonder it truly will touch your heart..its worth the money!!!
B0000640RX|5.0|Let me confess that in the whole period of DVD production, I've never seen such a brilliant, Spectacular & really Collector's edition (not only special edition) DVD set! It's beautiful and very well designed and produced with high quality material! <br />It consists of a Collectable real metal outer case, Spectacular metallic and glassy inner case, booklet, and 4 DVDs. but there are two complain, movies are double sided. Widescreen sides are Dual layer with DTS soundtrack. Full screen sides are single layers without DTS soundtrack. it means that if you deceide to watch a movie in full screen, you'll unable to use DTS which is soppose to be one of the most important features of this DVD set. <br />second complain is about the sound remasteration. in two of them, all of the sounds and speeches go through only one of five speakers! it's a real problem and it really botters when it shows 5.1 DD or DTS in audio menu but the real soundtrack is mono. it'll be good if the studio schedule a program to replace the defective DVDs! <br />I heart of a new release of RAMBO TRILOGY, I've not seen it yet but descriptions indicate that's an ordinary DVD collection. the sound quality will be difinately better than this one but about other features, I can't Discuss yet. better of this one or not, I can say it with courage, no DVD collection will be complete whitout the RAMBO TRILOGY SPECIAL EDITION!
B00000ILDE|5.0|I waited many years for a director's cut of Aliens. Ever since they shown a lot of the extra footage on a televised release (and cutting out some good original footage in the process) I have wanted this. When this DVD came out it was during a time when most DVDs didn't have a lot of extra stuff. Not only does this version pack all the extra footage but also extras that put most of the rest to shame.  <br /> <br />Now that the new Collector's Edition is out there it seems like this DVD just isn't worth the efford. Right? Well between you and me this DVD still has some extras that the Collector's Edition doesn't. For one it has an old interview with James Cameron on what the concept of Aliens was to be like. Very interesting to see him how he was back in the 80's. Also you get to see the full test print of the queen alien. Something the Collector's Edition only gives you a glimpse of. I think you might get more/different still images too, but I can't confirm that.  <br /> <br />If you don't have either DVD the Collector's Edition is still the one to get since there are more features, commentaries, and a cleaner picture. However if you are a die-hard fan I wouldn't throw away your Special Edition just yet. There are extras exlusive to this DVD.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|KEY: <br />91 - 100 - Perfect. A flawless PPV, you must buy this. Without a doubt this belongs in everyone's wrestling collection. <br />81 - 90 - Superb. An outstanding PPV, I highly recommend that you buy this. <br />71 - 80 - Great. A first-rate PPV, certainly worth your money. <br />61 - 70 - Good. A satisfying PPV. Perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. <br />51 - 60 - Fair. An average PPV.  It is worth a look, not your money. <br />41 - 50 - Mediocre. A dull PPV. - Perhaps take a look at this if you get a chance, I don't recommend it though. <br />31 - 40 - Poor. An unsatisfactory PPV - Maybe for hardcore wrestling fans, not for anyone else. <br />21 - 30 - Bad. A lousy PPV - This is not worth a look from anyone. <br />11 - 20 - Terrible. An awful PPV - Stay away from this and make sure you never see it. <br />1 - 10 - Abysmal. An appalling PPV - This is just a waste of time. <br /> <br />WRESTLEMANIA 2004: <br />John Cena VS the Big Show (United States Championship) - 6.5/10 <br />This match was nothing special. Had a few good spots but a boring match for the most part. <br /> <br />Booker T & RVD VS the Dudley Boys VS La Resistance VS Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade (World Tag Team Championship) - 7/10 <br />Again nothing special. A good performance from RVD. <br /> <br />Christian VS Chris Jericho - 7/10 <br />This match was a bit disappointing, kind of a match you would see on television not wrestlemania. Has a good ending though. <br /> <br />Evolution VS Rock 'n' Sock Connection - 9/10 <br />Definitely the match we were waiting for! This felt like a wrestlemania match and Mick Foley put on a great performance. Nothing very hardcore but the match was very exciting. <br /> <br />Torrie Wilson & Sable VS Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie - 2/10 <br />This was a waste of time to be honest, deserves 2 just because it was a playboy evening gown match. <br /> <br />The Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Championship) - 9/10 <br />This match was kind of short but was very good. Some amazing action from the cruiserweights and Billy Kidman did some unbelievable moves. <br /> <br />Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar - 2/10 <br />The worst match of the night and the worst match I've seen in a long time. This match deserved the BORING chants it got from the crowd and I gave it 2 only because of Austin's stunner on Lesnar. <br /> <br />Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi VS the Basham Brothers VS APA VS the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship) - 6/10 <br />I didn't like the idea of two 4 way tag team matches in one night and this one was disappointing. The first one was way better and this had no good moments. Just an average smackdown match. <br /> <br />Victoria VS Molly Holly (Women's Championship) - 2.5/10 <br />Basically your average women's match, very boring.  <br /> <br />Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle (WWE Championship) - 7.5/10 <br />This was pretty good match. Nothing amazing but still good. <br /> <br />Undertaker VS Kane - 7/10 <br />To be honest I expected more out of the match, the match was pretty disappointing but undertaker's return was one of the best moments of the night. The atmosphere in the crowd was great and I gave this 7 because of his return. <br /> <br />Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Championship) - 9.5/10 <br />Like the rock and sock match, this match lived up to its hype. Definitely felt like a wrestlemania main event. Thank god there was another great match in this poor wrestlemania. <br /> <br />SCORE: 75/120 (62.5/100) <br />According to the key I have rated wrestlemania as 'Good', a satisfying PPV and you could perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. This is accurate. Nothing amazing from wrestlemania. I expected so much more. Don't bother buying this unless you just want to see it because it is the 20th anniversary.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Dave Grohl and Co. are back again with another strong album, with an acoustic disc as a welcoming twist. I think the 1st disc is a typical foo fighters record that fans will enjoy, but the 2nd disc shines on dave's underated voice. Some may not enjoy the acoustic disc, but it is better to have more foo for the price of 1.  <br />HIGHLIGHTS: No way back, Best of you, DOA, The last song, free me, miracle, friend of a friend, razor.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Not sure when I picked this album up, but I have had it in the player for a while.  I like every single track on the thing.  It has been a while since I have put in a CD and have been able to listen to the whole thing and be satisfied.  I will have to agree on some levels that this brought rock up a level that was down before.......well maybe not down, but snoozing a bit.  I just love a band that can put together a full album and not just a couple of hit singles.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Rarely, can an album stand alone so purely and distinctly. It's been a long time since I've heard an album crafted this well. It's all in the details here. Coldplay makes Rock music enchanting and elegant. It takes it to the level of cinema. Coldplay has a habit of making their music an experience and that hasn't changed on their latest effort X&Y. While many cling to their prior work AROBTTH, I would encourage people to take a step back and judge X&Y as X&Y. Every move this album makes is deliberate and thoughtful. You can feel the band's rigor and exhaustive work. You can just sense that this took a lot of time and energy. And the result is far more advanced that many seem to be giving it credit for.  I wish people would quit asking, \\"Haven't we heard this all before?\\" No. X&Y is a different mood and carries a different sentiment. At times there are even classical elements woven it. But it all blends together masterfully. 10 years from now, X&Y will surely claim its place as one of the best of our time.
1401200923|4.0|Having just finished reading the Hush storyline I have to say that the twist-after-twist story was overall good, but the ending was quite unsatisfying. I think this is a common feeling among readers, and at about three quarters the way thru the book I was REALLY into it. But then the ending...meh. The implications of one storypoint could have been so good had they thought not to throw it away in one page at the very end!<br /><br />The art is of course FANTASTIC. I especially like all the batmobiles being drawn into the garage including ones from the Adam West show and the movies. The dialogue was really well done, but I wouldnt see myself re-reading this story very often like I do a few other comic book tales.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie explores an interesting topic that will leave you thinking for a while. Based on the premise that it is possible to delete selective memories, the question pops up: is this the right way to go after a bad relationship? Keep in mind that in order for the procedure to be successful they have to delete every little memory connected to that person, so you would lose the bad recollections, but also the good ones. So, is the trade-off worthwhile?<br /><br />The film starts in a somewhat confusing way, when we see Joel (Carrey) following an impulse one morning, deciding to ditch work for the day and run off to Montauk. Once he gets there he meets Clementine (Winslet), a girl of eclectic tastes regarding her hair-style and who works at a bookstore. Not only does Clementine change his hair following her impulses, but she also does other things that way. For example the same day she meets Joel, she declares \\"I'm gonna marry you\\". As you can probably guess, we get the feeling that there is something weird going on, which is explained by the fact that these two people have met before, but have erased each other from their memories.<br /><br />Joel and Clementine had a two-year long relationship that had its good and bad times, and which was so intense that when it ended, they could not bear remembering the details of it. So they went to Lacuna and took care of the problem. Michael Gondry presents all this information using a combination of what is going on in the present and events from the past, as well as incorporating very interesting and creative scenes that show the process to which the mind is exposed to when erasing the memories.<br /><br />At some points we get to feel some anguish connected to what is happening to the main characters, and this in my mind is a reflection of how well they perform in their roles. Carrey have been showing for quite some time that he is not only a funny guy, but that he can really act, following a similar career path as Tom Hanks. For more evidence of Carrey's outstanding acting I recommend \\"The Majestic\\". In the case of Winslet, I have not been a very big fan of her, but here she excels at her role and I got the same positive impression as in \\"Finding Neverland\\". It seems that she is maturing in terms of her acting career and improving consistently. When most people see that the movie features Jim Carrey they automatically think \\"Comedy\\", and as you can guess by now, this is not the case of the present movie. As long as you are clear on that, and are not looking for laughs, I believe that you will find the experience interesting, to say the least..

0743424425|5.0|I have to admit that I picked up the book after seeing the movie. As I picked opened the book I remembered thinking there is no way the book can top the movie. Boy was I wrong. 'The Shining' is without a doubt one of the ten greatest books I've ever read. Probably the the thing I loved most about this book was the tragic character of Jack Torrence. I couldn't help but feel sorry for him as the hotel slowly destroyed him. The plot was well developed, and moved along, at a great pace, and King writes in a style that is perfect for the book. In all honesty I can't find a single flaw in the novel. I definately recomend it.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I log on to Amazon.com's reviews to get some insightful opinions of the Foo Fighters new double CD and half of them are for ONE star because you feel the need to complain about the copy protected CDs?  First of all, I just downloaded these CDs to my Itunes with zero problems at all.  Second of all, there are ways around it.   Finally, shouldn't the reviews be based on the MUSIC, not for you to vent about not being able to download it????   The band deserves better than that, and that is why after being an Amazon member for over 10 years, I finally decided to write a review.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I have only listened to each CD once and I am not disappointed.  Dave Grohl said he hopes In Your Honor would turn out to be the Foo Fighters' version of Physical Graffiti, he was NOT comparing it to Led Zeppelin's classic double CD.  Ugh it is too hot to continue, if you like the Foo Fighters, I recommend this double CD highly after 1 listen.   Or you can read all of the negative reviews based solely on the copy protected issue, rather than the music itself.
6305232660|5.0|\\"Deep Impact\\" saw theatrical release in 1998, the same year as Michael Bay's big budget extravaganza, \\"Armageddon.\\" This, in my humble opinion, is the far superior film. <br /> <br />In much the same manner as the Bruce Willis outing, \\"Deep Impact\\" concerns the advent of a comet strike upon our planet. But rather than focus on two hours of lame comedy and cliched action, Director Mimi Leder instead gives us a moving portrait of real people who are forced to confront an unthinkable reality. Morgan Freeman gives a standout performance as our nation's President, and is but one member of an exceptionally strong cast of actors this film has to offer.  <br /> <br />I invested emotionally in each and every one of the characters, and that is a rare occurence for me. The seamless fusion of large-scale devastation and raw heartfelt drama is what really sets this production apart from all the other disaster movies that have since come down the pike. You would do well to seriously consider adding it to your collection. It is certainly worth the purchase and is very well done.
B000001Y5D|2.0|This album is a little too sluggish at times. While I like What's Up, the rest of the album struggles to find an identity. Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992.  But the strong standout is Linda Perry's strong vocals. She sounds like she's not having it! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut. But the music doesn't really match up. Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy!  She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music. Don't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show (which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days) about this band--she's too busy making hits for the masses and I'd rather hear her do that now!
B00005JNJT|4.0|The major flaws with \\"Batman Begins\\" are in the first act.  A \\"lost soul\\" gets mentored in the ways of this-and-that in some faraway and inhospitable locale.  Lost soul must learn to \\"conquer his fears\\" or something like that.  Pretty cliche stuff, and we've all seen it a hundred times.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this act, however, is more technical than artistic.  I am convinced that this act was chopped down in length (the final film runs 140 minutes, which is pretty much the longest running time the studios are comfortable with because they are trying to maximize the number of showings per screen per day).  The pacing of the scenes in the first act is clumsy.  It is either poor editing, poor direction, or both (but it is probably the editing).  Just as a movie needs a beginning, middle, and an end, so does each scene in its own way need a beginning, middle, and end, and each scene needs to \\"flow\\" properly or it looks clunky.  There are many problems in this area in Act One.  Plus, some of the warrior training stuff is just a little silly-looking.<br /><br />Things improve a bit as we move stateside in Act Two.  The pacing and flow improve.  I guess when cuts had to be made in the movie's running time, the first act received the most blows in the editing room.<br /><br />There are two main villains in the film.  The Scarecrow is the more interesting of the two, though I feel the part would have been served better by an older actor.  But some of the movie's best original bits center around the effects that The Scarecrow and his weapons have on his victims.  Pretty cool stuff, actually.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson plays a crime syndicate boss, but I think he plays it all wrong.  No real menace in his performance.<br /><br />There are a disappointingly high number of genre movie cliches in this film, such as the convenient way that principal characters manage to find each other so easily in a city the size of Gotham during scenes of great citywide chaos.  There are other cliches that I won't get into now, but if you have seen plenty of movies you will easily recognize them.<br /><br />The Batmobile is pretty cool.<br /><br />The \\"evil plot\\" of the main heavies strangely mirrors the Joker's plot in the 1989 \\"Batman\\" film.<br /><br />THANKFULLY, outdoor city scenes were mostly shot in an actual city (Chicago) rather than on a soundstage, like in \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", etc.<br /><br />Like in \\"Batman Forever\\", many of the fight scenes are shot so close up that you can't get a feel for the space or a sense of the action.  Why do filmmakers ALWAYS do that?<br /><br />Does Christian Bale do a good job?  Of course.  He is a very fine actor and does a splendid job here.  I never worried about that for one minute since learning he was cast in the role.<br /><br />The music is good without being intrusive.  There is no specific theme melody, like Danny Elfman and Eliot Goldenthal did so memorably in 1989, 1992, and 1995.  You won't leave the theatre humming the Batman theme.  But that's okay.  It keeps your attention on the film instead of on the \\"whole entertainment package\\".<br /><br />We learn in the film's final moments who the next film's villain will be.<br /><br />************  Final Analysis:  poor editing and overused cliches nearly ruin the first act.  The second and third act are far superior technically and artistically, though they still make us suffer through the occasional genre movie cliche.  Bale looks great.  This script allows his Wayne/Batman to express much more anger than previous films did.  The Scarecrow is an interesting villain that should not have been played by an actor who looks barely 23 years old.  But the actor is cute, and this IS Hollywood after all, so.....<br /><br />This film had all the ingredients to be an out-of-the-park Home Run.  Instead, it is a very solid Triple.  But compared to the last \\"Batman\\" film entry in 1997, it is a Grand Slam.  It is darker (though still not dark enough, ifyou ask me) and shows that there is still some promise left in the premise.<br /><br />Final note:  The scene where Bruce Wayne's parents get killed by a mugger ---  Bruce and his parents slipped out of an opera performance early because something in the opera gave young Bruce the heebie-jeebies.  So why did they exit via a side door into an dark and grimy alley instead of walking out through the front door like 99.99999999999% of the rest of the population with a functioning cerebellum would?  Even just one well-placed line of dialogue could have covered that, but the filmmakers didn't even try.  Instead, we are left to believe that the elder Mr. Wayne is, despite his character's actions prior to that moment, a blissfully ignorant idiot.ker (though still not dark enough, if you ask me) and shows that there is still some promise left in the premise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Final note:  The scene where Bruce Wayne's parents get killed by a mugger ---  Bruce and his parents slipped out of an opera performance early because something in the opera gave young Bruce the heebie-jeebies.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|Another great release from the Foo Fighters. <br /> <br />Disc 1 reminds me of There is Nothing Left to Lose in some areas and One by One in others.  Some very heavy rockin tracks and then some lighter guitar tracks.  Over all a nice listen and bound to appeal to the causal Foo Fighter listener and hard core fans alike. <br /> <br />Disc 2 is a plesant surprise.  10 tracks of beautiful acoustic guitar with Grohl's voice.  Very nice touch to it. <br /> <br />I like both disc's to be honest, and the purchase cost me less than typical double albums.  A great deal! <br /> <br />Despite all the warnings and complaints that these reviews suggest, I had no problem at all placing these discs on my iPod.  It worked like any other album for me.  I'm not sure why, but whatever. <br /> <br />Don't look into that nonsense.  This is a great album like any other Foo Fighter CD.  Perhaps not their very best, but definitly worth a look...especially for the second disc.  Copy protection or no, wonderful music.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I have been a huge Theater fan for 15+ years.  I thought they were begining to fade away with 6 degress, but \\"Train of Thought\\" brought them back up.  Now with \\"Octavarium\\", I feel they are on the down slope again.  Seeing them live is unlike many other bands...those of you who have know what I mean.  I am happy to say that this summer's GIGANTOUR will have DT, although the light will likely shine brighter on Megadeath unless Theater plays more of the old, less of the new
0321200683|4.0|First off, I don't know what the gentleman is on who said that this book includes examples with Web Methods and See Beyond.  It's a little bit strange to see such a long review with such a obvious error, makes you wonder what his motives are. <br /> <br />My interpretation of this book would be \\"Patterns for writing your own EAI type messaging architecture\\", hence the examples from Tibco (not Web Methods and See Beyond).  Unfortunately it doesn't go into a technical discussion of the various messaging technologies which I would have found even more interesting than the patterns.  However, it's a very readable book and I quite enjoyed reading it from front to back. <br /> <br />One word of warning, it's a \\"Martin Fowler Signature Series Book\\", which means it's more interested in being on the bleeding edge as opposed to being thorough.  Hence it refers to Web Services standards that weren't even finished at the time of its writing and completely ignores the messaging capabilities in mature technologies like CORBA (in fact the authors seem even ignorant of them).  If I would have noticed the MF signature series I probably wouldn't have purchased it, but I'm glad I did in this case.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Every other year a film comes out that deals with the importance of academics that send the message - stay in school.  Coach Carter is exactly one of these films, however, it also deals with the importance of athletics in the perspective of continual growth of young adults that cross the bridge of adolescence into adulthood.  Having this in mind, a question seems to surface that questions whether the audience needs more films that carry this message across to the audience.  In this case, the answer should be a resolute yes that should echo through the many high schools throughout the United States.  Many adolescents find themselves at a puzzled crossroads in their lives and this film could help by being one of the many sources that offer some guidance to the teen viewers.<br /><br />The fascination with Coach Carter rests within Samuel L. Jackson's character Coach Carter who unyieldingly enforces his law on the student athletes at Richmond High School.  When Coach Carter arrives at Richmond HS, he discovers that the discipline, academics, and athletic performance do not stand high with the students who more or less seem to run the school.  However, Coach Carter does not tolerate mediocrity in any aspect of being a basketball player on the Richmond Oilers, as he hands over a contract for the players to sign at the first meeting with the players.  The contract states that they have to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, wear a shirt and tie on game days, and sit in front of the class.  Several people, players and parents, believe that Coach Carter is out of line by enforcing his rules on the players.  But Coach Carter remains firm with his coaching philosophy, as he merely states, \\"These boys are student athletes. \\"Student\\" comes first.\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, Coach Carter faces a long road head of him, which begins with one victory after another.  Through the victories he begins to teach the players that hard work will eventually pay off, but he also coaches them about character and other worthwhile lessons that will be helpful throughout life.  On the academic side of the issue, Coach Carter discovers a strong resistance among the teachers and the faculty at Richmond HS.  They do not provide him with the progress reports that he needs to check on how the students uphold their contract by having a 2.3 grade point average.  Years of battling poor academics at Richmond HS seem to have sunken into the mentality of the teachers and faculty that these students cannot do better.  This is something Coach Carter finds unacceptable, as he deals with the problem directly by challenging the system.<br /><br />Finally, when Coach Carter receives the progress reports after much trouble he finds out that several of the players are either failing or have incompletes in their classes.  Consequently, he cancels the practices and forfeits the games until the players will have increased their grade point average, and they uphold their contract.  This however causes much disturbance among teachers, faculty, and parents who find that the students, who are unbeaten at the time are losing games due to forfeits, which could harm their chances of going to the State Championship.<br /><br />Besides dealing with academics and athletics, the film presents several interesting side plots through issues such as teen pregnancy, poverty, gangs, and drugs.  This portrays an authentic image of the real problems that teens face, yet these issues all get an obvious solution that might not feel true.  However, many young viewers can probably relate to the issues, and thus it makes it a powerful teaching tool, as they all deal with their own problems in their own way.<br /><br />Coach Carter has its cinematic blemishes, which the audience should overlook when observing the message that the film tries to send to a most likely young audience.  For whatever reason the audience sees the film, they get to experience a positive message that displays several lessons suchas perseverance, diligence, and teamwork.  In this light, one must consider the film to be a rather good film, even though some scenes have some awkwardness.  However, despite some of the cinematic gracelessness, Coach Carter delivers what he teaches-the message of diligently pursing ones own dreams so the inner winner will emerge.ssons such as perseverance, diligence, and teamwork.

B00028HBKM|2.0|I am an evangelical Christian who believes in the traditional Christian creed (Jesus is Son of God, etc...).   <br /> <br />However, I didn't rush out and see this film in theaters.  I only saw it a few days ago for the first time.  While I think that for Christians there is a fair amount here that should cause you to stop and think and ruminate about Christ's suffering, mostly I was just annoyed watching it. <br /> <br />I felt the performances were largely contrived (I don't count Jim C, I thought he was fine, if a bit too \\"traditional\\" in his portrayal).  The actors were OK I guess, but I think Mel's direction was overwrought or something.  Mary and Mary and John didn't have much impact the way the film was structured.  I thought the actors portraying the Romans, with a few exceptions, were terrible.  What was up with the Judas and the constant nose rubbing?  I haven't read through the gospels in awhile, but I don't recall that being in there. <br /> <br />Basically kind of mixed bag, really.  I'd have rather spent an extra 30 minutes at the end of the film going over the resurrection and Jesus' appearance to the disciples.  We could've lost at least a few minutes of flogging and maybe had a bit more resurrection in there...

B000005IS1|5.0|Kick Out the Jams (1968) is one of the best debut albums ever produced.  The MC5 were on fire that night the album was recorded.  They hit the stage running on all cylinders and tore the roof off of the auditorium.  Raw energy is what came of the band.  Wayne Kramer and Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith dual guitar sound couldn't (and still can't) be beaten.  Rob Tyner's vocals and the rhythm section kept the beat going.<br /><br />Their performance was \\"cosmic\\".<br /><br />Sadly the band fell prey to many of the pitfalls that rock groups tend to migrate towards to.  The Drugs and alcohol (mostly drugs) that fueled the band also derailed it and slowly made the members barely functional.  MC5's latter recordings (a couple of studio albums) weren't as well recieved as the first album.  This help the band collapse faster than the overindulgence in \\"medicial drugs\\" and<br /><br />streams of liquor.  Oh well, at least we have that one night forever remembered on \\"Kick out the Jams\\". The MC5 was a group that launched a thousand bands!<br /><br />Highly recommended, one of the essentials.
B00005JKDR|5.0|It's nighttime. Your mom gives you a good night kiss and closes the door. Quietly you try to sleep when suddenly you feel a creak in the door. The closet opens and a monster comes out to steal you a scream<br /><br />.<br /><br />For you it's a nightmare. To the monster it's a way to produce some energy. And that's the premise of Monsters Inc.<br /><br />The Monster City is located at the other side of the closet. Diverse and weird creatures wander on the streets in their daily routines, most of them without interacting with the humans. A particular company, Monsters Inc., transforms children's nighttime screams in energetic resources to keep the city working properly.<br /><br />Monsters Inc staff is trained to scare, and no one is better than James Sullivan \\"Sully\\" (John Goodman), who alongside Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal, a riot) is the best team of energy collectors in the company<br /><br />Monsters must avoid contact with the children, because they think children are contagious (genius premise); neither can allow them to go to the monster world, since they can't predict what horrible consequences would follow.<br /><br />And exactly that's what happens. A little girl goes through the door and sends Mike and Sully in an unprecedented adventure.<br /><br />Filled with honest laughs, warm and funny, Monsters is a charming movie with a story as original as their predecessor, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.<br /><br />In this adventure, Pixar once again pushes the excellence level in animated movies, using 2.5 million render marks, compared with the 1.1 used in Toy Story. Such accomplishments are obvious and admirable, especially in sequences where you can see clearly the blue skin of Sully in movement with the air, Boo's hair or the wonderful facial expressions of Mike.<br /><br />This is a happy movie, full of joy and a good lesson. Fear creates power, but a negative one, which inhibits people (and monsters).

B000005IU1|4.0|The Stooges (1969) is an awesome album that takes the Psych-pop sound to a whole new level.  Iggy Pop and the Asheton Brothers grind their way through this John Cale produced disc with gutteral vocals and guitar work.  Pop takes the 60's sound and turns it on it's head.  The band was hungry and mean (Cale brought out the best from this motley crew).  John Cale was hands for the most part (he added the death rattled whine of his viola on one of tracks padded out to give the disc a running time of a half hour). The band's debut album was good but they would shock everyone around them with their sophmore release Fun House!<br /><br />Highly recommended, one of the essentials.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast has been regarded as one of the best animated features of all times. Without going too far, we can assure it's one of the ten best and now we can have it on a Special Edition DVD, restored with remastered sound.<br /><br />For those who don't know the story: Belle is a beautiful girl living with her father (an inventor) in a XVIII France town. She's a fan of books, and has captured the attention of the town most coveted bachelor, Gaston, but is not willing to become a simple housewife. When her father is being kept in a horrible Beast's castle, Belle decides to save him taking his place as the Beast's prisoner. The Beast is actually a spoiled prince under a spell. Once in the castle, belle makes a few friends (servers under the spell too) and learns that true beauty lies inside people.<br /><br />Wonderful music numbers, a perfect story which balances comedy and drama and exquisite animation makes Beauty and the Beast a true cinematic gift for everyone, regardless of age.<br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience to relive; capable of giving us so many emotions as no other picture of its time has accomplished (the exception could be The Lion King). The only animated feature to receive a Best Picture Nomination, it has an endless charm.
B000005IU2|5.0|Fun House (1970) was the second album from The Stooges.  A saxophone player was added to the mix giving an even more acidic psychedelic sound to this power house group.  All the tracks are pure genius (T.V. Eye and Fun House are my favorite tracks).  Iggy Pop moans and growls his way through these bluesy psych-rock tunes.  The improved play from the Asheton brothers, the bassist and the sax player take the music to a whole new level.  A crazy<br /><br />drug fueled ride is what The Stooges take the listener on<br /><br />(Life imitating art).  The band hits it's creative peak with this effort.  Sadly drugs and the problems that come with addiction sends the band crashing down to Earth.  But for a instance, The Stooges were one hell of a band.<br /><br />Highly recommended, one of the essentials.
B000002HPV|5.0|This is my favorite Bjork C.D. of all time!  I think this album embodies \\"Bjork\\" on the whole.  It's the most emotional, passionate, and listenable.   <br /> <br />This album is the standard everyone measures any of her latter work against. <br />It's a definate classic! <br /> <br />It's very intense.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First of all, for the reviewers who think Dave Grohl \\"can't sing\\", you're all insane.  Dave Grohl has an amazing singing voice.  How anyone could listen to \\"Miracle\\" on Disc 2, for example, and say he can't sing is beyond me, but to each his own I guess. <br /> <br />About the album, there's nothing really new or groundbreaking, it's just another really solid album all the way through.  Disc 1 is basically a straightforward Foo Fighters album, comparable to their last album, ONE BY ONE.  But Disc 2, the acoustic side, was a great addition, and is beautiful - not to mention the fact that FF gives you 20 tracks on 2 discs without jacking up the price to over 20 bucks, just regular price.  They really show off their songwriting skills on Disc 2 that many rock bands usually do with only the standard-issue ballad at the end of an album.  Foo Fighters gives you ten.   <br /> <br />If you're a Foo Fighters fan, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  And if Foo Fighters' rock music doesn't do it for you, you may still find the album worth buying for Disc 2 alone.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Relating to the previous review shadows cannot sing anymore, i agree.I seen them live in Glasgow.The support (mendeed if you wondered) stole the show.However shadows does have a reason.He blew his voice box at the Reading Festival in England.Surely you knew that!You should also know he had surgery and then vocal training from the person who trained axel rose amongst others.So if your going to see them live dont expect 'second heartbeat' or reminissions' cause he just cant sing them!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the best tool album, a huge improvment (particualy in production) from the such other great tool albums as AEnima.  Completive, relaxing yet thick with distortian and drum soloing, music that is certainly worth the listen. <br /> <br />Tool show in this album that they a craft which is sadly lacking in other prog artists around.  The Mars Volta, for example, comprise of exceptionaly talented musicians, but do not have Tools ability to 'make music'.  They careful craft Tool use to create there songs is exceptional, and sorely lacking in such other prog/metal artists as the Mars Volta/Deftones. <br /> <br />Each song has its own fantastic merits, with no one \\"stand out\\" song, similar to the classics like floyd's The Wall or the beatles Sgt. Pepper'sLonely Hearts Club Band. <br /> <br />Five Stars, definatly worth purchasing, even if you ordinarly do not like heavy metal.  My favourite bands, before i got into Tool, were Radiohead, Muse, Jeff Buckley and other so-called 'softer' artists.  Do not make the mistake of thinking Tool are another head-banging, angsty-teen band.
B000000XCF|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival delivered three straight A records in a row in 1969 and 1970, \\"Green River\\", \\"Cosmo's Factory\\" and this one.  \\"Willy & The Poor Boys\\" is a masterfully executed collection of folk, blues, rock n' roll, country and R&B, opening with the stripped-down shuffle \\"Down On The Corner\\" and closing with the eerie minor-key blues-rocker \\"Effigy\\". And in between you find the blazing hard rock of \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"It Came Out Of The Sky\\" mixing with jugband blues, folk, a sort of rockabilly spiritual, and wonderful covers of \\"Cotton Fields\\" and \\"The Midnight Special\\".    \\"Fortunate Son\\" still holds up today, unlike most Vietnam era prostest songs, and John Fogerty lays down a vocal track burning with rage and resentment.  \\"It Came Out Of The Sky\\" is one of the best, hardest rock n' rollers of the 60s and 70s, and the overlooked two-minute \\"Don't Look Now\\" features some of Fogerty's finest lyrics.  There is literally not a single weak moment on this album. \\"Willy & The Poor Boys\\" is an amazing record, more varied than anything you'll ever hear today, yet everything gels, everything sounds like genuine Creedence.  And it still ranks as one of the greatest rock n' roll records ever cut.
B000002I97|5.0|This album is full of great songs, it's an all-time classic.  I want to focus on one in particular, though.  Prine said recently that he brought it out of a 25-year retirement at the special request of the President -- \\"not a formal request, but he's sure asking for it.\\"  The song, of course, is \\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore,\\" originally written about the Vietnam War.<br /><br /> The song features a guy so patriotic that he covers his windshield with flag decals, runs into a tree and dies.  However, the \\"man at the pearly gates\\" says:  \\"But your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore, it's already overcrowded from your dirty little war.  Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for, and your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore!\\"<br /><br /> One of the best things about the song is that it's not Dylanesque folk, it's not psychedelic, it's country, complete with pedal steel guitar.  It goes well with that great observation that \\"patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels\\" and TR's thundering defense of dissent, saying that blind support of the President is the worst form of treason (that's Teddie Roosevelt, the Republican president).
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have been looking forward to buying this double disc since spring when I first heard about it. I went to Best Buy and got it the day it came out. I was going to buy the \\"DualDisc\\" but realized it was 15 more bucks, just for a \\"making of\\" which is probably like 10 minutes long. Since I bought it at Best Buy I have the opportunity to get a FREE song that was left off the album off of napster. I don't have napster, nor do I want to sign up for it, so that was kind of pointless. Next the copy protection isn't necessarily a hassle, if you are actually trying to burn it. However I just wanted to listen to it while I was on my computer, to do so you have to install a special program, and to listen to it you have to keep a full screen \\"foo fighters\\" file open. Fu*k that. It kind of seems like the foos are trying to make an extra buck on this one. The band actually gets paid like 50 cents for each disc that gets sold, I guess a major label band with 5 discs under their belt may need a little help economically. HOWEVER, the music itself is pretty shway. <br />When I first heard \\"Best of You\\" I was pleased, but felt let down by the constant build up, but no delivery in the end. The title track does the same thing for about three minutes, then breaks, I was pretty pissed off at first, but after a second or two the song comes back HARD. After that I was looking forward to the rest of the disc, and the acoustic disc. This is a great album to a long time Foo fan, but to an ordinary listener, it may not be that great.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I purchased this cd the day it was released and like many other reviewers, did not think much of it upon my first listen. It sounded nothing like AROBTTH (one of my all time favorite cd's ever) A week later I can honestly say it I CAN NOT STOP LISTENING TO IT!! I absolutely have fallen in love with the music as well as the lyrics. There isn't one song that doesn't get 9/10. Buy it, listen to it, give it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed! I can't wait to see them in concert this summer! <br />I also admire the band for caring about other things in the world besides getting rich and famous.. check out the recommended websites in the cover! You just might learn something, I did! <br />One final thing.... if you feel you have to insult people because they have different tastes, styles, likes and dislikes YOU ARE one of the reasons we still live in a time when war is a reality! Lighten up!! Respect, Live, Learn, and GROW! PEACE!!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|It's great to have not one, but TWO new Foo Fighter albums to listen to this summer! <br />I'm definitely digging the mellower side more; it's a bit more of a departure for the Foos. I LOVE the revamp of 'Friend of a Friend,' which hardcore Foo fans will recognize from Dave's 'Pocketwatch' demo. I'm also really into 'Razor,' the last cut (pun intended) on the album. As usual, Josh Homme makes a stellar appearance. <br />My only criticism is this: the opening chord progression on 'Cold day in the Sun' sounds almost IDENTICAL to the opening riff of 'Alaska,' a song by Krist Novoselic's band EYES ADRIFT. Don't know if that's intentional or not... <br />In the end, though it doesn't really matter. The 'RAWK' side RAWKS and the 'chill' side chills, so there's a little something for everyone...
B00006RCOB|3.0|Although the idea of the novel, and later the movie, came from an actual event that occurred in 1976 when Lt. Viktor Belenko defected from a base in the Soviet Far East to Japan in a, then, secret MiG-25 Foxbat (I read a book about it called \\"MiG Pilot\\" written by John Baron), one would have to guess that the name \\"Firefox\\" came from the name \\"Foxbat\\". <br /> <br />There was plenty of good action with some humor in it, but I find some portions of the film unrealistic. Though I have never been to Russia or back when it was called the \\"Soviet Union\\", I could tell that there was so much stereotyping of Russian officials where one would constantly \\"ask for papers\\" and it seems that everyone would get asked for papers by some KGB official - even if the one being \\"asked\\" is on the \\"john\\" in the men's room (which looked too clean, by the way!!!) and one official got killed by Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) after telling him that his \\"papers were not in order\\". <br /> <br />The plane - a MiG-31 Firefox - looked like a craft that could have come from a sci-fi movie like \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\".  The First Secretary looked like someone who could \\"croak\\" at any minute just like the old hard-liners did back in the early 1980s beginning with Brezhnev and some of the other old \\"Bolsheviks\\" that followed who were beyond \\"expiration\\" prior to Gorbachev's rise to power that led to the fall of the Soviet Union itself nine years after the movie was released. <br /> <br />As a Cold War veteran myself, serving overseas in England at the time of its release, I was in my early twenties and for someone at that age the entire movie would be exciting to watch, and I had watched it several times. I was led to believe, \\"Did they really do that to people regardless if they're Russian or not minding their own business as they were  walking the streets of Moscow?\\" or \\"Were the hotel rooms overlooking Red Square with the honor guards of the Red Army marching in full view that big and immaculate?\\" I later believed that the film and the book went a little overboard as I got older. Moscow, in a way, looked like as if it were a city in the West and not like it actually was back then. <br /> <br />I had to laugh at one portion of the film, and that was the Russian immigration official Gant encounters at the airport after he arrives in Moscow who tries to act really tough, \\"Are you threatening me?\\" This was rather silly. <br /> <br />Good movie, but some bad acting!!!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I am so happy to have this album!  There has been a long span of time since I cared about getting any full album.  The music industry is so filled with crap.  Even other bands that I like put out only so-so efforts. <br /> <br />When I had heard that Dave & co. were releasing a 2 disc set, I thought that would give them just enough rope to hang themselves!  ( I am a huge, huge foo fan, but I know that nothing good can last forever). <br /> <br />Well, when I heard this album, a subtle distinct smile came over my face as I listened to it.  WOW.  Dave did not (and has not ever really) let us down.  I am thankful for this album.  There is something magical (a formula that only they have) that makes this band something really special.   <br /> <br />Favorite tracks on the album are Best of You, DOA (wow now they have MIA and DOA!), What if I Do?, Virginia Moon, and Cold Day in the Sun. <br />They need to let Taylor sing more often.  At first I thought it was Dave doing something different with his voice.  I think it adds to the band what Peter Criss added to Kiss with \\"Beth\\" or \\"Hard Luck Woman\\". <br /> <br />Great, Great album.  Not their best.  (They would have a hard time beating \\"Colour and the Shape\\" & \\"There is nothing left to lose\\". <br />But I have to say that I am impressed.  Good work boys.  Thanks for the <br />tunes.  Can't wait to hear your next album(s)!!!!
B00005JNJT|4.0|It's funny how Warner Brother's didn't want Tim Burton back for the 3rd movie since he made the movies too dark. Yet Batman Begins is probably the darkest and most serious of all. I guess Warner Brother's learned that darker is better than goofy and overly colorful since Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. This is the best since Tim Burton's films and what a Batman film should be like. Christopher Nolan gives the film a human touch and makes it more about Bruce Wayne and his feelings than about the villains. The other movies sorta just made Bruce Wayne/Batman a side character to the villains. Speaking of the villains Nolan takes them seriously. They don't prance around saying silly lines in this one. Plus I also doubt Nolan is ever gonna focus on shots of Batman's butt like Joel Schumacher did. He takes everything about it seriously.<br /><br />  Maybe too serious though since it could use to lighten up just a little a bit. Besides having a problem with that. I don't like how Batman talks while in the costume though. I found it a little silly how deep and monster like his voice sounds. Also Roger Ebert acts like the whole poison gas thing is 100% original for a villain to do in a Batman movie. The Joker did that in the first movie. I do like how this gas puts fear into people though. The gas in the original just made people die with goofy smiles on their faces. The Scare Crow (Cillain Murphy) is what a villain should be like. He doesn't burp and say \\"was that over the top ? I never can tell\\", he's 100% serious. Cillain Murphy from 28 Days Later does a fine job playing him too. The other villains are well played also and don't goof around what so ever.<br /><br />  Christian Bale makes a great Batman and the best since Michael Keaton. He has a lot of inner-demons to fight in the movie. He first thinks he needs to kill the man that killed his parents. When he tells his childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes) his plan. She slaps him and says \\"your dad would be ashamed\\". So he runs away from Gotham City and meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard trains Bruce how to be a ninja and how to control his fears. When Bruce discovers that Ducard and Ra's Al Ghil (Ken Watanbe) have evil plans for Gotham City he decides that's not the sort of man he is. He then goes back to Gotham City. There he turns a tunnel he discovered as a kid into...the batcave. Then he gets all sorts of gadgets \\"including the batmobile\\" from a loyal Wayne employee Lucius Fox (Moragn Freeman). He decides to dress like a bat since bats were always his fear. So he decides to use his fear as a weapon.<br /><br />  It's nice to the see the actual tranformation he makes to Batman in this one. That was never seen in the other films. We see him use all those gadgets in the other films but never had a clue how he got them. I always doubted he made all of them on his own. So the Lucius Fox character is a nice touch. Plus with Ducard we also know that Batman didn't just train himself to fight. There's just so many characters to mention in this film. Nolan actually fits in a nice ammount of screen time for them too. Rutger Hauer gets to make the best out  of a small part. He is the type of actor who can make a small part seem like a bigger one. That's how good of an actor he is. He plays the not so nice guy who takes over the Wayne business after Bruce's dad is killed. He told Bruce when he was little that he could have the business when he is ready. Which is a lie because he's not that eager to give up the job. I expected some crazy employee to kill  Haurer. I mean look at the other films. It isn't one where a villain doesn't kill his or her boss lol. Gary Oldman also shines as Lt. Gordon who is the only cop who trusts and befriends batman. I'd rather just see more of them teaming up than Robin or Batgirl ever being introduced again. Batman is much better without them. Batman is also much better without...Joel Schumacher lol.So he runs away from Gotham City and meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard trains Bruce how to be a ninja and how to control his fears.

0262731541|4.0|I have BS2, but in June 2005 ordered BS3 think it is great.  Lots of recent information, re-organized, and overall was an improvement over the previous 2 editions.  I still find it useful to have an older edition around (e.g. BS2) to see how things have changed and new information on aerodynamics, nutrition, etc. have been discovered in the last 10 or so years.  CAVEATS: --I was disappointed that aerodynamic research done with Lance and Steve Hed etc. were not included.  --For practical advice on training, nutrition, aerodynamics advantage of certains pieces of gear, seat height, etc., I recommend ED Burke's books, such as 'Serious Cycling', 'High Tech Cycling', etc.  --For specific training plans I recommend Chris Carmichael's books.  --For repairs, I recommend the books from Park Tools, and Barnett. --A collection of Gene Sloan's repair books not only gives great advice, but also lets you see how various components have evolved over the last 20+ years.  Still, an entertaining book for those of use who wonder about the affects of bearing friction, mechanical loads, etc. and the affect it may have on our riding.
0553573403|2.0|I'm less than halfway through this book and I'm not sure if I'll be picking it up again. I find myself dreading what awful things are going to happen next. As I began reading, I found the story refreshing. I thought, \\"Finally, a fantasy book that's not at all derivative of Tolkien.\\" But, it quickly spiraled downward into a morass of abject suffering and misery. Shocked! shocked, I was. I give it two stars because it's well-plotted and paced, and the characters are well-drawn. The content is what sinks the story for me.<br /><br />To me, the appeal of fantasy books is the setting and the characters--swordsmen and sorcerors fight evil and live to tell the tale of their heroic deeds, in a world different from our own, a world where evil never triumphs. But Martin seems to relish placing his characters in a world where amorality is the rule of the day and proceeds to turn them into meatloaf, with no hope of escaping the meat grinder. This isn't fantasy--it's horror. Children being raped, children getting drunk, children being murdered, incest, animalistic sex, buckets of blood, animal cruelty--not even Stephen King goes wall to wall with this sort of trash in his books.<br /><br />It pains me to write a review of a book before I've finished it, but what must be done must be done. This George R.R. Martin fellow is a pervert writing for amoral sociopaths, and/or a sadist writing for sadomasochists. If you want your fantasy books full of hopelessness and obscenity, A Game of Thrones is for you. I'll stick to the Tolkienesque side of the genre.<br /><br />I'll consider any unhelpful votes to be proof of the immorality of whomever casts them. Goodnight.<br /><br />addendum: 5 out of 52 helpful votes? I see a good scolding must not have been in order. The overwhelming response leads me to do the unthinkable: I admit that the sex scenes bother me because I've never had sex. No, no--please. Let me finish. It's tough to read about aristocrats having all the sex and bastard children they can handle when you're a virgin. Girls look at me like ... like ... well, like I read fantasy books. All you guys out there who know how to score--I salute you. Especially if you've managed to overcome being a skinny white boy.a virgin.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|..but easily the best concert I've ever attended. I'm so glad that I bought this DVD to watch over and over. <br />Perfect sound and the photography is great..maybe too good since Don, Glen, Joe and the boys are getting older.  Fantastic instrumentals as usual. <br />There are two discs since it is such a long concert. Very attractively boxed.  Makes a very nice gift to any Eagles fan.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I was fortunate, so i thought, to be one of the first to hear the new album live in san diego before it was released. First let me comment on their old material. Shadows just can't sing the old songs like he used to. And how blasphamous, they didnt even perform their classic second heartbeat. The music sounded awesome live, synister hits every note almost perfect live. But shadows tries to hard to sing live now. And his new singing style carries over to such classics as Eternal Rest and unholy confessions and it just doesn't work. Now to City of evil. the album would probably be good if some average band produced it. Some of the songs are too long and the rhyming on this record is sophomoric at best. This album would be a success for most bands, But fans expected so much from such a talented band. Hopefully the people who considered themselves hardcore A7X fans don't give up on them cause this band has so much potential.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This album is very good.  Jack Black has a surprisingly beautiful voice and the acoustic and electric guitar playing flows very well with good legato and consonance, even if one is not a big fan of the actual song being played.  While the humor may lose some of its biting edge after many listenings, it is always nice to play it again for those who have never heard it.  Some reviews have mentioned that the songs get old after a while...so does any song, including those of the Beatles or Iron Maiden.  I can only listen to so many pop/rock/r&b songs about love and sex or so many heavy metal songs about world injustice or demons.  Far more relevant to the average joe like me are songs about everyday life...not the ups or downs but the mundane rather meaningless crap that we live through daily, the thoughts that we keep to ourselves not because they are shocking or revolting but because most people do not care to hear about nothing (maybe Seinfeld will disagree).   <br />     One can find broader meaning in many of Tenacious D's songs.  In Tribute, satirization of exaggerated unprovable claims rings loudly long after the song is never played again.  The Road, a humorous song on the surface, displays the loneliness that even a movie/rock star can feel due to the demands of one's tour.  Inward Singing demonstrates how even those closest to us may have a pattern of trying to bring us down and try to thwart our creative expression and our God-given unique abilities and accomplishments, even if the given accomplishment seems ridiculous at the moment.  The friendship song forces us to introspectively question how strong a friendship really is, even if it has existed for years.  City Hall shows how corruption is almost inevitable among those in power regardless of original intentions for attaining that power.  Another characteristic that makes one appreciate Tenacious D songs is the fact that they sometimes throw in random lyrics, unrelated to the main topic of the song.  For instance, \\"look into my eyes and it is easy to see one and one make two, two and one make three, it was destiny...\\".  While this may be dismissed as none other than Jack Black acting like his ridiculous self, the true effect is actually that the songs themselves are closer to replicating the thought process in most people's heads...a stream-of-conciousness approach where while one may be dwelling on one topic, many other random unrelated and unimportant thoughts occasionally creep in even when one's mind is supposedly engrossed in something else...\\"would you hand me that shotgun buddy also that chair\\".  This makes it feel like Tenacious D are \\"thinking aloud\\" when they sing, almost in a purely uncensored fashion, as far as such is possible for a public album.  All of this makes it easy to relate to the messages in their songs, makes the humor more readily and deeply relevant to the public even if it is unconventional and appears childish at times, and makes the deeper messages more powerful.  Another good thing about Tenacious D is that most songs are short, around 2 minutes.  Not much time is wasted on repeating choruses or verses like the majority of Top 40 crap out there.  This makes it more enjoyable to listen to the songs entirely and more of them exist because the songs are short.  Who the hell wants to listen to \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" over and over (or read this review) after a few times when the song, even though good, is over 11 minutes long?  The mixture of songs and dialogue also make a wonderful combination and gives a little insight into some of the songs that follow the dialogue.  These guys are true musical geniuses and entertainers and hopefully they will not sell out and produce crap like most everyone else, not including System of A Down or Iron Maiden, who are still good.  I look forward to Tenacious D's next album with new material, whenever the hell that will be released.
1577311523|5.0|I am not a follower of Eckhart Tolle like many who live by his every word.  I have meditated for last 20 years. Meditation has transformed my life in ways that I find hard to describe.  I would be fine if I never read another word by Eckhart Tolle, as my Buddhist insight meditations are fully satisfying to me.  Yet, I find it a great blessing that someone like him is with us on this earth. And he is not the only one who is awake - if you see carefully, you will find there have been quite a few enlightened beings or messengers on earth in very recent times, many more than there were in the past (for a small list - J. Krishnamurti, Dalai Lama, Tyohar, Osho, A.H. Almaas, Khalil Gibran, Neale Donald Walsche, and so on).  <br /> <br />I want to address some of the critical comments in the most popular review on this book titled, \\"The Title Says it All,\\" posted on August 26, 2003, by IAF_67 (USA). <br /> <br />The reviewer says, quote,  <br /> <br />\\"To me, it seemed as if the author was simply repeating the same basic idea over and over again; which, again, is not necessarily a bad thing. However, it begins to become annoying when the book has as many pages as this does; and after reading all of them you feel as though you could have just read the title and received all the information from that.\\" <br /> <br />This reviewer is complaining about the fact that this book repeats the idea of being in the \\"now\\" so many different ways. This reviewer is obviously looking for entertaining his \\"mind.\\" He came to this book for the wrong reasons.  The reviewer wants to enter the present moment (as stated in his first para), but it seems by USING the mind.  This book will literally take you \\"out of your mind\\" and move you to your heart.  And repetition is ok for the heart.  Love repeats all the time, yet there is incredible newness if you can be present to many subtle dimensions of love.  Only mind needs continuous diversity of what it perceives as \\"newness\\" because it cannot appreciate the newness in the slightest and subtle changes in the present that keep unfolding.  The trees and animals can feel these, but the human mind is too clouded and burdened with the past and the future to feel these.  I disagree with the reviewer totally about the book being repetitive.  I find that Eckhart Tolle can bring alive the present moment from so many angles.  If your heart is open and mind is silent you will find his writing very potent and loving, opening up new subtle doors on many pages.   <br /> <br />The reviewer goes on further with his critique, quote, <br /> <br />\\"After reading this book a couple times, I still don't really know how to get to that spot of inner peace. I don't know, either, how to feel the \\"...still, observing presence itself behind the content of your mind, the silent watcher\\" (pg. 46). I don't even think there was a technique telling you how to achieve that, actually. Sure, the author has included some meditations, but they're nothing new. The same old \\"Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within\\" (pg. 93) type meditations, which can be found almost anywhere else, even on web pages (for free, no less) are included in this book.\\" <br /> <br />Whew!  What was the reviewer expecting.  I guess a mechanical technique that instantly enlightens him.  I have meditated for 20 years.  I have experienced moments of bliss many times now, but they do not happen simply by practicing a technique, using the mind.  Wouldn't the whole of humanity be already enlightened if it were so easy?  Letting the mind go and entering the heart is the hardest challenge for human beings.  After all, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and many others have been \\"repeating\\" the same message of love and oneness for centuries.  For this to happen we have to be in a total let go.  Directing your attention to the body is needed to be grounded.  That message wont change even for  human being to be born in 2,500 A.D.   <br /> <br />The spiritual insights do not evolve in the same sense as scientific knowledge evolves.  Spiritual insights remain the same, but since the audience changes, new masters use new words.  The audience was different at the time when Jesus lived, so Jesus used different words, but which conveyed the same insights even back then.  Now the mind of the audience is different (much too clever and sophisticated) and so different words are needed to convey the same insights.   <br /> <br />Yes, you can find similar statements made by many others, but you wont find the aliveness that you will in Eckhart Tolle's words.  Have you heard any of his tapes?  The immense depth and calm in his voice may surprise you.    <br /> <br />Finally, the reviewer says, quote, <br /> <br />\\"Overall, this book did not live up to it's hype. I found it to be long and rambling; the author took the title of the book and expanded it into 191 pages full of the same idea phrased with different words. He attempts to tackle some other subjects too, of course, such as relationships. However, he basically uses the same \\"power of NOW\\" approach to these as well; meaning that he suggested a relationship would evolve into true love when both partners had eliminated their respective egos and become completely immersed in the now. That's the solution for EVERY problem, it seems. So he's just using the same message for different problems, which seems to be more of a \\"pie in the sky\\" promise to me.\\" <br /> <br />This is your personal experience, but please don't exaggerate the importance of your experience for others.  I don't know if you realize that deep down how incredibly \\"simple\\" all of spiritual insights are.  But that is the problem, the mind is too egoistic and complicated to appreciate these insights. You need \\"love\\" to experience the connectedness, \\"awareness\\" to experience the present moment, and \\"honesty\\" to discover who you are.  These same values are also in many spiritual paths, including even the \\"Conversations with God series\\" by Neale Donald Walsch, who is another great spiritual messenger.  The heart can understand these in an instant, but the mind can take eternity, and still not figure it out.  You seem to want different solutions for your different mental problems of worrying, fears, etc. (which you mentioned in your first para).  The truth is that the solutions are not many.  The same key opens up many doors.  Humans want to hear the same solution using different words, however, and so we have so many Masters just doing that.  The variety is needed not because the spiritual insights come in different flavors, but because of the human mind, which has incredible diversity with 6 billion people from so many cultures and conditionings.  So my advice is simple - move to your heart, and you may actually experience the \\"pie in the sky\\" easier than if you were to figure out by continuously \\"thinking\\" using your mind.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone with an open heart.
B000002KHH|5.0|A Classic. Thumping guitar solos, mind bending base and the ear bleeding rantings of the dark lord of rock, the ozmeister! <br /> <br />Whilst I still maintain that The Zep's Immigrant song is the best short song ever, with Paranoid, the Sabbath, come a very, very close seccond. <br /> <br />The highlight of the album for me is the end of War Pigs & start of Paranoid, it brings back memories of tearing down the M62 in the old mans big old Jag, with this blaring out of the windows and sunroof; saddly it had to end, in Hull! <br /> <br />Buy it, play it every day, love it.
B00004YA66|5.0|I give this movie a 5 because not many movies compare to this one as far as repeated watchability, and originality. Normally I'm not into a movie if it's not completely realistic. This movie however, is where I draw the line. The movie's plot does seem a bit unrealistic, but who cares. It's about a guy (Caviezel) who's dad (Quaid), is a firefighter, has been dead since he was a kid.  <br /> <br />Anyway, his nephew digs up an old 2 way radio that Caviezel and his brother used to use with their dad as a kid. It sparks some old memories, and he starts to use it. The twist here is that you see the Northern Lights shining outside the night he starts using the radio. So he starts talking to a man, who turns out to be his dead father in the past. It's really intriguing because he tries to change the past, only to find out that it changes more than he could ever imagine. I sincerely believe that you can't change the past without altering other future events. The movie then takes you on an intense suspense ride. <br /> <br />The movie is an intense thriller with tons of emotion. Caviezel and Quaid really deliver great performances in this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who is as sceptical of UNREALISTIC movies as me. <br /> <br />
B000148KK2|5.0|The big difference between this collection and previous Diana Krall CD's involves the range of emotions she elicits with these songs. For instance, \\"Abandoned Masquerade,\\" is distinctly depressing, and \\"Black Crow,\\" is as bleak as a snow filled, black and white, winter landscape at twilight. In the past Diana Krall has stuck to top notch classic songs with a warm, engaging emotional feel. A change to a broader emotional pallet was bound to trip up some of her long term fans, and hence the many negative reviews from disappointed fans who expected an outing similar to her many excellent previous productions.<br /><br />For various reasons, some people don't want to hear songs that are depressing, and many people have a particularly hard time with the cold, alienated emotions found in a song like \\"Black Crow.\\" The other side of the coin, of course, is that many people do experience a wide range of emotions in their lives, and it is exciting, moving and engaging to encounter songs that mirror their feelings.<br /><br />Diana Krall has the sensibility and the musical talent to deliver these songs. This album evidences the continuing broadening of the emotional range that her voice can convey. I would say that this broadening has been in evidence in each of her releases, but it has become especially clear in the last two studio albums and in her recent live DVD's. It will, however, be disconcerting to some to hear the explicitly ragged, cracked vocal sound that she uses to such powerful effect on some of these songs.<br /><br />Usually when I see a very mixed set of reviews like the one's found here, I tend to think that the artist has slipped, often quite seriously. In those cases, the good reviews are from the die hards who refuse to abandon a favorite, and the bad reviews are from the folks who are willing to accept reality.<br /><br />In this case, however, I think Diana Krall has really opened up new and exciting emotional and melodic terrain that she has never risked in the past. There is nothing wrong with having a taste for the wonderful albums she has made over the years. However, if you are willing to explore some rough and challenging emotional terrain, you are likely to agree with me when I say that this is her best, and most satisfying album.ver risked in the past.

B00097DX3U|3.0|Okay, I love Audioslave.  I was born out of the Soundgarden crowd, and I know how much talent Cornell has.  This is why this album pains me so.  Morello's tired, predictable, grating riffs and guitar solos are downright ANNOYING.  He has become the proverbial nails on the chalkboard.  Some of the best songs on the album have these horrible guitar solos/riffs that all but ruin the songs.  Their first album was much better, so if you buy this, expect those crummy solo's like you heard on \\"What You Are\\".  Keep your animals away from the speakers. <br /> <br />I expect so much more from a band that is playing with Cornell.  Their next album will be much better without Morello. <br /> <br />Come on, let's all chant: \\"MORELLO MUST GO\\".
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Those who loved the prequel, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" will, undoubtedly, be disappointed by this sequel, as it lacks much of the charm of the original, as well as its rapier sharp and witty script. Instead, the viewer is set upon by a bloated script that lacks intelligence and charm. Even the main character, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), our formerly lovable every woman, seems to have lost some of her winning ways, as what previously seemed effortless, now seems too contrived. Quite frankly, this film simply does not reach the heights of excellence that the prequel did. So, those viewers who loved the original film will be disappointed.<br /><br />The direction of this film seems ham-handed, with a screenplay that simply tries too hard to be all that the original was.  Unfortunately, it fails in its execution, hampered with too many sub-plots that are simply not funny. Colin Firth (Marc Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver) reprise their original roles and manage to hang onto their charm, but their dialogue rings hollow, as they struggle with a script not worthy of them. Ms. Zellweger also struggles with her role, as at times it calls for her to act totally stupid, something that the original screenplay did not require. The screenwriters obviously confused stupidity with naivet&eacute;.  It is a shame that they were unable to come up with something worthier of the wonderful talent in this film. While there are some funny moments in the film, they are few and far between. In fact, some of the film is downright painful to watch. Still, those moviegoers who viewed the first film should see this sequel and judge for themselves. They should, however, rent rather than buy it.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Here we go again. Same reviews all the time. I swear these dudes just post one and then copy it and apply it to a hundred different bands. I'll throw in two lines about how much this band sucks and then i'll name all the bands I know that I think you don't know. I'm not impressed. I don't care that you listen to Iced Earth or Death or Deicide. It doesn't affect my opinion of this album that you can name the guitarists from In Flames or Children of Bodom. If you're going to review an album, lets just focus on THAT particular artist, shall we? Now for the album. A decent effort all the way through. It's not a stellar album, or the savior of rock, but that is not what it is supposed to be. For what it is, it's very good. The riffs(hacked or otherwise) are very compelling and the vocals traverse from melodic to screaming a lot more effortlessly than others in the \\"metalcore\\" genre. It is very accessible and I feel that is what turns it off to most of you. To you, it seems, a band is not good unless you are the only one who has ever heard of them.(and damn that makes you cool)For me, music is something to be enjoyed- its not a contest.
0805066349|5.0|It has been nearly six years since I read this book, but it's tragic look at America's treatment of the Native Americans has lingered with me ever since. It is a look at how \\"manifest destiny,\\" the belief that Anglo-American expansion was decreed by God, lead to, among other things:<br /><br />-The seizing of Indian lands;<br /><br />-The raping and murdering of women and children;<br /><br />-The futile attempts by the Indians to stop this conquest, and;<br /><br />-The forced relocation of Native Americans to \\"Indian Reservations,\\" a similar process that Hitler used on the Jews during the Holocaust.<br /><br />The cruel and barbaric treatment of the Native Americans in the nineteenth century the is still the greatest sin America has ever committed, and one from which it will never be free from. \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is a powerful and tragic book that shows how the need for power and expansion leads to the destruction of those who, according to some, \\"stand in the way of progress.\\" I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B000002C2E|5.0|\\"Time Out Of Mind,\\" Dylan's Grammy-winning 1997 album, deserved the award.  The songwriting is top-notch, Lanois's production is dreamy (almost psychedelic), and the album cohesion is perfect.  What you need to know is this: Bob Dylan isn't the same artist he was when you (might have) stopped paying attention to him in the mid-70's.  Yes, his voice sounds utterly different.  No, he's not writing songs that are made of strung-together literary allusions.  The Dylan on \\"Time Out of Mind\\" is weary, cynical (still), cryptic, but still secretly optimistic.  This album (along with \\"Love and Theft\\") are essential listening for anyone who is thinking about seeing Dylan live but hasn't been paying attention the last few decades.  Some highlights of this dark masterpiece are the opener, \\"Love Sick,\\" the paradoxically dreary/optimistic \\"Not Dark Yet,\\" the bluesy \\"Cold Irons Bound,\\" and the ballad \\"Make You Feel My Love.\\"  However, thanks to the production and general feel of the songwriting, this album's overall quality is greater than the sum of its parts--a great mood listen from start to finish.  Check it out!
0316172324|1.0|The author and publisher wasted a lot of time on this book. My time. From the start I was disappointed in just about every conclusion and assertion Gladwell made. For example, he said most doctors who were sued for malpractice were sued because they had bad personal rapport with their patients and not because they were incompetent or negligent. He said that in fact many of them were very good doctors. Then on page 43, he suggested that patients choose doctors on the basis of their inter-personal skills or personal feelings about the doctor. This does nothing to improve a patient's chances of finding the best medical help. In fact, using Gladwell's information (highly suspect) presented to describe doctors who get sued, points in the opposite direction - that a person should pick the doctor they hate the most in order to have the best chance of getting the best medical treatment. The rest of the book was just like this. At least up to page 188 where I finished the book. It is in the dumpster now to prevent some other human from wishing they had that part of their life back spent reading Gladwell's stuff. Go read V. S. Ramachandran's Phantoms In The Brain for some real information.
B000003TA4|1.0|Lets see, yet another collection of the same ten Nirvana songs we've all heard ad nauseam hundreds of times.  Nirvana were the most corporate, commercial, dare I say MANUFACTURED band to ever come out of the 80s.  These guys were so slick and contrived, they would make New Kids on the Block look like a brutal underground hardcore punk band! <br /> <br />Yes, Nirvana truely were the \\"Good Charlotte\\" of the 80s.  Slick, contrived, corporate, and tailor made to exploit whatever trends were hot in the 80s and 90s.  Just listen to their 1989 debut \\"Bleach\\".  That whole album was nothing more than a shallow and obvious attempt to take advantage of the anti hair metal backlash that was going strong at the time.  Its like the record company executives said \\"Hey, a lot of people out there don't like Bon Jovi and Poison.  Lets manufacture an anti hair band to take advantage of that trend\\". <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it, Nirvana were not the \\"saviors of rock\\" that rock critics make them out to be.  They were nothing more than a corporate rock hit machine, made up by their record company, and it is so blatently obvious.  They made at least a dozen videos for MTV.  They had an \\"Unplugged\\" special on MTV.  They signed multi million dollar record deals with Geffen Records.  They even wore matching flannel outfits!  They promoted themselves on Saturday Night live.  Their T shirts were widely available at suburban malls.  Wake up, Generation Xers!  Are your drug ravaged minds really that stupid?  Your idol Kurt Cobain was a fake!  A phoney!  A blatent marketing scam!  Every time he claimed to be against commercialisim, it was all a lie!   <br /> <br />Nirvana were the Milli Vanilli of rock.  The Backstreet Boys with guitars.  Corporate rock at its worst.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a fan of Green Day's from close to the start. I own all their albums, and I really enjoy their music. Much like it was during the release of Dookie, with American Idiot, many of the \\"true\\" Green Day fans are accussing the band of selling out. Trust me when I say this, but this band probably sold out before you even heard their name. <br /> <br />Why I know American Idiot is a good album is because I can easily listen to it non-stop. In fact, within the first week of buying the album, I was truly blown away. The songs have depth, and they all work together to produce a thorough, well-made album. <br /> <br />Beyond the politics, the makeup, and the overplay of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" on MTV, what we have in American Idiot is simply GOOD music, which is something I don't hear a lot lately. Just because they got a few hits and some overplay on the radio doesn't mean that this band doesn't know how to still make good music.  <br /> <br />Keep an open-mind, pretend like you've never heard of Green Day before, and give the album a listen...you'll have a good time.
B000059Z8J|4.0|NOTE: I included what some may consider spoilers on the first few scenes. Nothing big or crucial, but read with care... <br /> <br />I finally got around to watching this classic film the other night. The dramatic opening credit sequence really got me psyched, and somewhat contrary to my expectations, Marlon Brando was great as Jor-El (how could I have doubted Brando?). I enjoyed watching the setup scenes on Clark's high school years and his discovery of his Kryptonian heritage. I admit, however, that I was really waiting for the young Jeff East to exit and for Chris Reeve to step in as the older Clark/Superman. Finally Clark completes his studies on Krypton's past and we see a short teaser scene of Reeve flying toward the screen in his classic reds and blues. <br /> <br />But the film makers managed to keep me in suspense by stopping the action there and cutting to a scene of the bustling offices of the Daily Planet. Lois chats with Jimmy Olsen and then proceeds to enter Perry White's office where she is introduced to Reeve as the be-speckled Clark Kent. Folks, these next three or four scenes comprise the true apex of the film, not to mention the best bit of acting I've seen in some time. In fact whenever Reeve is onscreen (as Kent or Superman) you're guaranteed a fantastic performance, but this is never more evident than in his scenes as the bumbling reporter. <br /> <br />You won't even fully realize how talented Reeve is until the scene in which he's talking to Lois offstage. He begins as Clark. Then he starts to work up the courage to reveal his secret identity. He removes his glasses. Considers things carefully. And begins to speak as Superman. IT'S AMAZING!! He grows about 4 inches, his voice (which you probably hadn't even noticed was high) deepens a pitch or two, his expressions and gestures become noticeably more confident.....and then he decides against the revelation and IMMEDIATELY returns to the nerdy Kent. <br /> <br />The rest of the film was well written, but really only a few echelons above average. I would give the film a 3 or a 3.5 but Reeve shot my score up to a high 4. For those of you who haven't seen Superman yet, I won't detail anymore scenes (and there are several more good ones). But needless to say it is a MUST SEE. Go rent it, make some popcorn, and watch it with the lights out. Up, up, and AWAY!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It has a great cast that should be able to instill something about the characters that you actually like, but there is absolutely nothing to like about anyone in the film.  It is disturbing because these people are so horrible to one another you can't believe you are sitting there listening to this filth come out of their mouths directed at someone they supposedly care about.  This is not entertainment nor does it shed any light on the human condition it is just ugly people being ugly to one another.
B000929AJQ|2.0|Trent once said that he would loose his job if he went and saw a psycologist (yes he actually said that!) and I think its time he does what he said. Everybody who likes it are his \\"new\\" genre, who aren't aware of his old achivements, that he was once a genre by himself. Now he is another rock-star, an entertainer, who is pickpocketing us to keep his luxirous life alive, like Marilyn Manson. Thats all he is trying to do.. Ripping the adult people who buy the image, rather than the music. I have always believed in him, I loved every single song of him, I didn't download his songs but bought original CDs because I thought he deserved it. But not anymore. I am not gonna listen his junk anymore. They aren't gonna rip my $$ anymore. <br />
B0008KLVG4|4.0|We all know that this is another attempt to make money by the studios. but, this dvd does have a deleted scene of Quint (before Departing on the Orca) and a 60 page booklet. but if you dont give a hoot about the booklet then this is practicly the 25 edition. I am not saying DONT BUY IT i just mean its almost the same. otherwise its the same old Jaws. <br /> <br />I hope you found this helpfull if you have any questions dont bother to E-mail me at miamiguy803@aol.com
B0008KLVG4|5.0|If you really are a true Jaws fan you shouldn't any problem shelling out $15 for this latest edition.Its worth it alone for the 5.1 sound,the whiners should call a wambulance.THIS IS THE ONE TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION.
0451529308|5.0|Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up.
B000006045|5.0|I first listened to Dissolved Girl on the first Matrix film. I bought the albulm once I found out the artist, and I must say this is truely a work of art. Very dark with deep bass. I love listening to this albulm while Im driving like 3am in the morning. Its nothing energetic, but merely something that you want to listen to at night and chill. This is their best work without a doubt.
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is so amazing.  I downloaded this cd from aol music net and they considered the used as an alternative/indie band.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD really delivers the goods -- big-time shivers with sizzling arrangements of some likely and some unlikely choices that will all have you dancing across the floor.  Michael's voice combines an old-world swing with a delectable pop sensibility that re-invents some of the best songs you've ever heard.  Most thrilling are his playful re-tread of You've Got Me Under Your Skin (which makes use of nearly the exact Nelson Riddle arrangement for Sinatra), Foggy Day In LondonTown (which literally explodes as it grows), and a wonderfully fizzy version of Save The Last Dance For Me.  But there is no clunker here; every song is a delight. <br />
0140187650|5.0|This book is true to its title.  It takes evil and deconstructs it into small, banal pieces.  It is compelling reading, presnting a lesson that is still valid.
1577311523|1.0|Trying to follow where the author is coming from is extremely difficult.  He relates spiritual experiences as if everyone has the same experiences and can easily produce them at a moment's notice. Nothing seems to weave together or even be drawn together for an overall balance or logical conclusion.  I found it to be quite boring and difficult to read.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The new Foo Fighters Album is definitely the one they'll be remembered for. The contrast between CD1 and CD2 works very nicely! Here's a review for each song:<br />Disk 1<br />&quot;In Your Honor&quot; -Awesome song and great start to the CD! 5/5<BR>&quot;No Way Back&quot; -Nice tune, especially good drumming in this one. 4/5<BR>&quot;Best Of You&quot; -Great song, sounds just like them! 5/5<BR>&quot;DOA&quot; -Amazing song! Great lyrics! 5/5<BR>&quot;Hell&quot; -Good song, sounds a little strained though... 3.5/5<BR>&quot;The Last Song&quot; -Opening sounds a lot like &quot;Wind Up&quot; Great! 5/5<BR>&quot;Free Me&quot; -Really cool harmonizing guitar! 4.5/5<BR>&quot;Resolve&quot; -Most laid-back track on the first disk, but cool. 4/5<BR>&quot;The Deepest Blues Are Black&quot; -Great, Driving Song! 5/5<BR>&quot;End Over End&quot; Sweet finish to the first disk! 5/5<br />Disk 2<br />&quot;Still&quot; -Really cool low chords in this one! 4.5/5<BR>&quot;What If I Do?&quot; -Cool, but I dont like the steel string...4/5<BR>&quot;Miracle&quot; -Awesome piano (JPJ!) 5/5<BR>&quot;Another Round&quot; -Interesting rhythm, sketchy lyrics! 4/5<BR>&quot;Friend Of A Friend&quot; -Its about Kurt Cobain! (duh) Wicked! 5/5<BR>&quot;Over and Out&quot; Very melancholy tune, sounds &quot;stairway to Heaven&quot;  influenced! 5/5<BR>&quot;On The Mend&quot; Cool bowed double bass in this track 4.5/5<BR>&quot;Virginia Moon&quot; Very surprising contribution by Norah Jones! 5/5<BR>&quot;Cold Day In The Sun&quot; Reminds me of &quot;Marigold&quot; where Grohl sang lead for Nirvana, good job by Taylor! 5/5<BR>&quot;Razor&quot; Strange song, but wicked guitar by Josh Homme and Dave Grohl! 5/5<br />So there you have it. I love the new CD and for anyone who IS wondering which Foo Fighters album to buy, this could be a definite good start to your collection!
B000000HSU|5.0|surely one of the best punk hardcore records, and at this day the only all black punk band. they introduced reggae in the punk (which became \\"fashion\\" since then). this record is 22 year old, but kicks asses of bands like nofx and that kind of crap... A must have for all music addicts
B00005JNJT|5.0|Not to worry! \\"Batman Begins\\" is nowhere near the trainwrecks that were \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" .. aside from Katie Holmes (a poor choice for the character of Rachel Dawes), this movie is enjoyable from start to finish!    This movie is dark, gripping, and action-packed. The acting is OK for the most part, as is the plot, of course. Aside from a few dodgy scenes (including the death of the parents and when Batman confronts some fat villain-esq type character), this movie's filled with style and substance and will have you keeping your eyes glued to the screen.    Morgan Freeman, thankfully, is tolerable in this movie and fits nicely into his role. Nothing over-done, nothing small. Just right.    But surely the biggest flaw of this movie is the fact that Katie Holmes was cast(ed) as the leading-lady. This woman gives us a C-grade performance and somewhat de-rails this movie's potential. I say they should've gone with a stunning blonde or brunette who knew how to act well -- and who could've had actual chemistry with The Caped Crusader. Katie Holmes seems all right when she first appears, but ultimately she's D.O.A. and I'm not happy she was put in this film.    This film's not campy. At all. It has some good dialogue and some pretty sharp/ace lines. This film's a lot darker than its predecessors and it's more intense.    Christian Bale made for a decent Batman. He's a finer pick than Val Kilmer and George Clooney.    Oh, and the ending leads us to think that there's room for a sequel. Hopefully we'll get one in 07/08.    It was well worth paying $5 to see this movie in the theatre.    ..Oh, and how creepy was The Scarecrow?! ..Ugh. I might just have nightmares! Awesome villain in this one!
B0000A0DRY|4.0|This album really marked the start of the Jefferson Airplane, when they found their voice. True, they had already released Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, with such treasures as It's No Secret, Come Up The Years and Don't Slip Away. These featured the powerful folk rock vocals of Signe Tole Anderson and Marty Balin, but had been recorded back in late 1965 and the band were to find their m&eacute;tier as spokespersons for the psychedelic generation, not as electrified tambourine-bashing folkies, however good, and had been changing direction throughout the tumultuous social upheavals of 1966.<br /><br />Signe Tole Anderson left the band to have a baby, performing her last gig with the band on 15 October 1966 at the Fillmore in San Francisco CA. The following night at the same venue new member Grace Slick stepped into her shoes, and on 31 October 1966, less than three weeks later, she went into the RCA Studios in Hollywood with the band to begin work on the album that became Surrealistic Pillow. When the sessions were completed on 22 November, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off was only just appearing in the shops but was already obsolete.<br /><br />Grace Slick had been singer with the Great Society and came with two songs she used to perform with them. Someone To Love (written by her brother-in-law Darby Slick)was rearranged and reworked as Somebody To Love to become the first single taken from the album after its release, and a million-selling US Top Five hit. The other was its follow up, her own Carrollian ode, White Rabbit, another million seller. If Jefferson Airplane had never released anything but White Rabbit, their place in the hall of fame would be beyond doubt.<br /><br />Both signified the direction their music was to take. However, Surrealistic Pillow is probably the most rounded of all the Airplane albums in terms of group members' contributions as it also features songs by Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and ex-drummer Skip Spence. These included the surreal She Has Funny Cars, beautiful ballads like Today and Comin' Back To Me, the Donovan-esque protest song Plastic Fantastic Lover and the more psychedelically experimental DCBA-25 and 3/5ths Of A Mile In 10 Seconds. It also featured the magnificent virtuoso guitar instrumental Embryonic Journey, written by Jorma Kaukonen in 1962.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are mostly outtakes from the album sessions and are all excellent.

B00062IVKI|5.0|As you can see by the reviews, nobody is too sure what to rate this movie. I heard Liza Minnelli in an interview once refering to New York, New York as \\"dark\\". I think that is perfect. It's a story about musicians with music - It's not a musical. It's directed by probably one of the greatest american directors of our age - I think to enjoy it you need to clear your head of any preconceptions. After watching it - I couldn't make up my mind if I understood what the movie wanted to say... But then I thought! Gee - What happened to just appriciating a great story and some superb acting. There are very few movies like New York, New York for us to compare it to, I think that is the problem, people aren't sure what they got from the movie. I'm open minded enough not to need it to 'be' anything. The movie is dark and heavy, but then light and wishful. It's beautiful - and it's lead, Liza Minnelli looks very very beautiful. Thank god they released this on DVD. Wonderful.
B000002LEU|3.0|Perfecly complementing their two essential studio albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, this expanded compilation re-issue rounds up their legendary singles, including Transmission/Novelty, Love Will Tear Us Apart/These Days and Atmosphere/She's Lost Control, none of which appeared on the albums and are rightly regarded as among their greatest works.<br /><br />Substance also contains their first release in full, the EP An Ideal For Living (recorded in December 1977 at the point when they changed their name from Warsaw, but only released privately by the band in a limited edition the following summer), two tracks they recorded for the EP A Factory Sample (their first work with producer Martin Hannett), both sides of a freebie flexi-disc single (Komakino/Incubation), a French B-side (Dead Souls) and two outtakes from the Unknown Pleasures sessions.<br /><br />This is not a complete round-up but in its more complete CD edition will probably satisfy most of the less obsessive Joy Division punters
B00005JNJT|5.0|The film basically follows a plot of focusing mainly on Bruce Wayne. The other 4 films directed by Burton and others focused mainly on the villans and gave The Bat a backseat. Well, now Batman  now has his own movie. The first part is where Bruce Wayne's origins, and follows how he got to where he was and why. The second part follows the devolopment of his alter-ego, Batman. The third part is less plot developed, but packs a solid action punch. The third and second part focus on Batman's pursuit of Scarecrow.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece. Instead of putting Batman in the backseat like previous directors had, He has created basically a tribute to Batman, focusing on his life and emergence. He also adds his own style and darkness to the film, making it a lot better than the animated style of Burton. He makes Batman more realistic and helps us see how exactly Batman formed. The effects were supurb, and I had a fun time watching this fantastic film.<br /><br />In closing, I thought this was the film that everybody has been waiting for.  Batman fans have been waiting a long time to rejoice over the story of their hero, Batman. He has been put in the back seat too much. This was his moment to shine, and by god, he has been given the proper film for it! Fantasic film!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After \\"train of thought\\" i didnt know what to expect. <br />I own all there albums, and that to me was was there worst. <br />I guess were all waiting for another \\"images and words\\" <br /> <br />This was not what i wanted to hear but.....i got to admit <br />it's good!! <br /> <br />The album as a whole, covers alot of ground. <br />In the end, D.T. is a band that is growing and changing, wich always scares me of my favorite bands.But this i can deal with. <br />Good song writing. I miss hearing jhon and mike show there stuff <br />but the songs flow so well it works. <br /> <br />Not the old stuff we love, but if there gonna keep changing this is a good path! <br /> <br />Hey, least they didnt turn to crap like queensryche's last few albums.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale) has not slept over a year. He tries everything that he can to make himself go to sleep, but ends up not going to sleep. He then suddenly has erratic mood changes, and has change in physical form and mental form. When people start treating him differently, he seeks solance in a call girl(Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n). Then he starts seeing a figure called Ivan, who torments him on every turn. Trevor then has to find himself and find what is wrong in order to stop all of the madness.<br /><br />Christian Bale shed 60 pounds to play this role. That is a incredible feat for a actor. That broke records for a role. Bale actually went through some hardcore changes to get this part. He was brillant. Brad Anderson has created a brooding haunting film about the effects of pyschosis. I was in awe of this steller film and its truely dark underscores.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is a much better concert than Hell Freezes Over.All the big hits were there except the \\"big\\" man Don Felder (not sure what happened between him and the band, I heard there was some law suit there). I miss him, he is the sound of Hotel California, the new guy Steuart Smith does a great job filling in but it just does not have the same sound that we used to hear. <br /> <br />The Eagles look older but they sure sound better than in the 70's. Joe Walsh is just great and hilarious although he looks like the oldest in the band. The horn section adds a nice touch to the music, I did not find it intrusive at all.The DTS sound is superb along with crystal clear image video, all additional musicians on stage do an excellent job as well. <br /> <br />I wish there could be more fireworks and a better lighting show.The interview was short, there was not much talk about the concert's behind-the-scene/preparation and nobody mentioned about Don Felder in the interview! But put those things behind, this is a must owned DVD, 10 stars! Anybody knows about the Farewell II Tour?
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This album has fully restored my faith in the band.  After hearing the boners of the Blaze days, I was very cautious.  I had been a faithful fan up until then and felt abandoned when they put out a pair of mediocre albums.  After a successful album in Brave New World, I wondered if lightning could strike twice.  I had heard from so many places that Dance of Death was no good, so I actually held off until May '05 to buy it.<br /><br />What a chump I was!  I missed out until recently on some of their best work.  It's so reminiscent of their early work, yet melded with their new sound.  So many songs are of the Icarus/Invaders/Trooper/ calibre with the sonic power of 7th Son.  Sorry, but people asking for Maiden to change are just looking for someone to put out another stinker like St. Anger.  As long as the boys from the Beast are putting out albums of this quality I'll be buying them on the release day from now on.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Okay, I went in with pretty low expectations. The last two Batman movies were aweful, and the original preview of \\"Begins\\" didn't impress me much. I got a bit into the hype and saw it in the giant Imax theater, though. I was completely blown away. <br /> <br />This film pulls you in from the start and doesn't let you go till the last 'batarang' falls. It actually had a very interesting plot, some mystery, and a neat twist. Being Batman, it also had awesome fight scenes. <br /> <br />This movie really captures the essence of the Dark Knight. The movie is dark and paints a vivid picture of the real Gotham City. Bruce is a brooding, vengeful hero who walks the fine line between savior and conqueror. The movie really explores his inner demons and his moral dillemas. <br /> <br />This is a must see, even if you are not a fan of the series. It was ten times better than Spiderman 2, which I had thought of as the best hero movie prior to this. It has superb acting and the plot is just great. Christian Bale is perfect as Batman and Michael Cane is great as Alfred. I'd give this movie a 6/5 if I could.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|but the Foo Fighters have made, not one but two, boring albums.  I've listened to it several times now, trying to place a finger on exactly what it is about this album that disapoints me so much - and it's the fact that Dave Grohl can yell all he wants, the album just isn't fresh, exciting, or inspiring.  These were all words I would use to explain the previous Foo efforts - but it just isn't there on this one.   <br />Even songs that seem at first to be catchy (Best of You and DOA are great examples) fade and feel old and tired after just a few listens.  There isn't anything here that sticks out as making this album worth purchasing.   <br />Sadly, I am even more dispointed in the second disc than the first one.  I really enjoy the few acoustic songs that I have from the Foos (Everlong and Hero especially), so I was really counting the days till this one hit stores.  Again, unfortunately, nothing on the second album has heart - which is what made their previous acoustic efforts so great.   <br />There is nothing I can really point to on this album and say, \\"This is horrible\\" or \\"This is why I don't like the album\\".  That's the problem - the album doesn't really make you feel anything.   <br />It is a boring album - and that's about the worst thing you can say about a Rock album.   <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|AFTER NIRVANA I NEVER EXPECTED DAVE GROHL TO TAKE OVER LIKE THIS. LETS FACE IT, THE FOO FIGHTERS AREN'T THE GREATEST BAND OUT THERE, BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDERS. FOR A DRUMMER DAVE HAS SHOCKED ME PROVING HE'S A LOT MORE THEN A DRUMMER. HIS LYRICS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION ARE AS GOOD AS KURT COBAINS. HIS MUSIC ISN'T, BUT THATS OKAY BECAUSE IT'S STILL GREAT. I WOULD STILL TAKE NEVERMIND AND IN UTERO OVER ANY FOO FIGHTERS ALBUM, BUT I STILL THINK THE FOO FIGHTERS HAVE AMAZING ALBUMS. EVERY SONG IS GOOD AND SOLID. I SAW THE FOO FIGHTERS IN 1997 WHEN PAT SMEAR WAS STILL IN THE BAND. NIRVANA FOR THE LITTLE TIME THEY WERE AROUND WERE JUST AMAZING. A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE KURT COBAIN DIED SO IT'S UNFAIR TO COMPARE NIRVANA'S SHORT CAREER TO THE FOO FIGHTERS. YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED AND HOW SHORT NIRVANA'S CAREER WAS. THE FOO FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN AROUND LONGER. NIRVANA SIMPLY EXPLODED ONTO THE SCENE WITH SOME INTENSE SONGS FOR THE TIME. THE FOO FIGHTERS ARE A GREAT BAND, BUT I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE WHO COMPARE THEM TO NIRVANA. NIRVANA WAS A BAND IN THE EARLY 90'S THAT WERE AROUND A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. FOO FIGHTERS ARE A BAND DURING A DIFFERENT MUSIC SCENE AND HAVE BEEN AROUND LONGER SO IT SIMPLY ISN'T FAIR TO COMPARE THEM. IF NIRVANA WAS AROUND LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE MANY MORE AMAZING ALBUMS. A LOT OF KIDS TODAY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY NIRVANA WAS SO SPECIAL. THEY WERE SPECIAL BECAUSE NOTHING SOUNDED LIKE THAT IN 1991. THEY ARE UNIQUE. I CAN'T STAND WHEN KIDS TODAY COMPARE A BAND FROM 2000 TO NIRVANA WHEN NIRVANA HELPED ORGINATE THAT SOUND THE OTHER BAND IS PLAYING. KIDS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.  <br />I HEAR THE FOO FIGHTERS AND I'M LIKE THIS IS VERY GOOD. WHEN I FIRST HEARD NIRVANA I ALMOST SH*T MYSELF IT WAS SO GOOD. THATS THE DIFFERENCE. IT WAS ALSO A LONG TIME AGO WHEN NOTHING SOUNDED LIKE THAT UNLIKE TODAY.
B00069BON2|5.0|It's already seventeen years of Kylie Minogue's career. This compilation shows the whole evolution of this artist from cheesy starlette to dance diva. This is the most expanded, Japanese edition of this title with all songs from standard international version but also with two bonus remixes.     It's hard to believe today, but Minogue recorded her first songs only because someone asked her for doing it. The rest is history. She became one of the most famous artists in history of music, even though unfortunately she didn't manage to achieve this status in the U.S.A.     And that's just the main reason to buy this double CD set here in the States. It's about time to discover her most important works which made her an icon of pop culture outside this country.     This set contains 33 songs (including 2 brand new - especially marvellous \\"I Believe In You\\") + 2 remixes. The first disc sums up the years 1987-1992 - time of creative captivity, when Kylie sang all what she was told and she had nothing to say because everything was under control of extremely successful UK producers Stock-Aitken-Waterman, whose simple catchy songs then conquered the hearts of teenagers all over the world.     An the second one sums up the years 1994-2005 - time of music freedom, independence and above all maturity, when Kylie started to discover new sounds and also brand new audience, what brought her a big respect in music showbusiness.     In general we can find on this set almost all from thirty nine Minogue's UK singles, but it's very weird, because in total there is almost forty minutes of free space, so all the singles could have been put on it. The biggest mistake is a lack of astonishing 1991 hit \\"If You Were With Me Now\\" recorded with Keith Washington. But great completion to this collection are very good remixes: \\"Can't Get Blue Monday Out Of My Head\\" and \\"Slow\\" (remixed by The Chemicals Brothers).     Anyway, it's a well done compilation, which Kylie's American fans should buy at once to discover at last why she is the second Madonna overseas.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|And, that's saying a lot coming from me since I went into it with some serious reservations as to whether it could live up to the play.  Just one warning, though.  Try not to compare their voices too closely to the original cast.  That's the mistake I made when I saw this in the theater and no, they're not as good.  But, now that I've seen it again on DVD, I've realized that taken on their own, their voices aren't particularly bad.  In fact, there were times, like on \\"The Point of No Return\\" where I thought Gerard Butler actually did a better job of conveying the emotion in his voice.  They both did a great job on that scene, better than I've ever seen it done on stage.

B00062IVKI|5.0|This is one of the most underrated films in the history of cinema. The first time I saw it I didn't know what to think. I wondered, why the fake looking sets and unbelievable costumes? Why did Scorsese seemingly overproduce a film that has such a great and raw script? This dvd helped me see why. Scorsese says that he wanted to put a raw, dramatic script into an old, early 40's style setting. He wanted to contrast the new with the old. The script is real, raw, and dramatic. The sets, costumes, and musical numbers are very highly produced. There's so much detail put into it. The city curb is a just a little high. The collars are just a little big. It really does remind you of an early 40's musical. Liza is the real star of this movie. Although I like Cabaret better as a whole, I would say that Liza as a singer, dancer, and actress is at her best in New York, New York.

B000025RX4|5.0|The sound of the rhythm guitar in \\"Look Up\\" is incredible! This is one of my favorite albums by JW. This is IMHO some of the best rock music that was ever made or ever will be made.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Christian Bale elevates this already-superb story into a sci-fi cult classic.  Some have described his acting style as \\"wooden\\" and \\"emotionless\\", but for me he's the exact opposite -- someone who shows an entire range of emotion leashed -- just barely -- beneath the surface.  In Equilibrium, he seethes with anger, a sense of injustice, dismay, guilt, righteousness, and yes, love, all played mostly with looks, not words.  From the opening scenes, Bale and his first partner, played with gravitas by the excellent Sean Bean -- let you know that this film will NOT be a tired rehash of concepts you've seen before.  Sure, the world (post WWIII, futuristic-Third Reich distopia) may at first seem like a mish-mash of pulp sci-fi films with a dollop of Matrix thrown in for good measure -- but Bale, Bean, Diggs and Watson all act as if this is the first time this story has been told -- and we the audience are quickly convinced!    I can't say enough about Bale's acting, he does a great job, but it's really his physical control and athleticism that stand out.  The \\"gun-kata\\" fight sequences are phenomenal.  I don't know why no one ever thought of it before and I don't know WHY Kurt Wimmer hasn't done anything with it since!  I want to see a whole movie about gun-kata.  I want to see Equlibrium II!  Come on Wimmer, give us more!    Anyway, between this role and this macabre performance in the Machinist, Bale had a lock on the role of Batman.  Glad he's finally getting the high profile he deserves, but in truth, he should have been a major star because of American Psycho and this movie.
B007STBUIW|4.0|The Blu-ray transfer of JAWS is nothing less than astounding. There are shots so crisp and clear they look like they were shot with a RED Epic last year. I can actually read the labels on the bottles of the medical examiner's office. This title easily competes with the magnificent Blu-ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR and THE SHINING as one of the best possible Blu-ray transfers of all time. It's even better than THE GODFATHER and CHINATOWN Blu-rays, which were slightly softer from age. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE: a few occasions where the shot is underlit, the grain has a strange fuzzy texture to it, but only in a handful of shots where the camera is shooting with conflicting brightness (the coroner's office when Hooper says \\"Well this is not a boat accident!\\" is the best example). Otherwise, night, day, exterior and interior shots are exactly as they should be.<br /><br />The film gets 6 stars in my book. The supplementals...not so much.<br /><br />The supplementals are mostly upscaled transfers from previous editions, and all with subtitles, so there's that. Unfortunately, aside from the 9-minute Restoration Process vignette, there's not much to get excited about. None of the other extensive documentaries--not even the 2011 History Channel restrospective--is included.<br /><br />The most painful part of this Blu-ray is the TREMENDOUS LETDOWN that is THE SHARK IS STILL WORKING documentary. After 7+ years of tireless, dedicated work by true hardcore JAWS fans that put ME to shame, the original 180+ minute cut that covered the vast cult of JAWS fans worldwide is a mere 100-minute History Channel-esque series of vignettes that merely grazes the larger picture. Some vignettes are better than others, but scores of material that has been available on the Internet for years during the assemblage is completely absent. I think that Universal has meddled too heavily in the final product. Perhaps the most painful thing of all is that this intended monument to the cult of JAWS borne out of true love for the film is a highly compressed upscaled 360p-480p mess. The resolution is barely better than the quality of the outtakes/deleted scenes. I was deeply hurt and disappointed by how this film has been treated.<br /><br />And all these supplementals are crammed onto the same disc as the film. So that means that the additional 25GB that could have been dedicated to more glorious image & sound data is instead dedicated to squishing a handful of RE-RE-REpackaged supplementals that were thrown in there with the care of a used towel. With all the extra stuff about JAWS made over the years, a bonus BD-50 containing them would not have been much to ask.<br /><br />Overall, the Blu-ray is worth buying because the movie transfer is so fantastic I can't give it anything less than 5 stars. Unfortunately, the disc itself is so callously indifferent to the fanbase and collector potential of the film that it gets a paltry 3 stars.<br /><br />That brings it up to the 4 you see above.
B00001OH7U|5.0|STS is probably the Best 70's Bowie Album he made, but it's a tough call to say that up against Hunky dory, Diamond Dogs, The Lodger and others. <br /> <br />If  ifs n ands were pots and Pans i.e. Take Young Americans and Fame from Young Americans LP, then add to STS, you then have an Album that would be a complete piece of work. <br />However, it was fate that only 6 songs were recorded. Maybe it was for the best, you couldn't then say that the LP contains any Filler tracks. <br /> <br />Bowie was not known for Prog Rock (Personally Prog rock does not have any rules anyway) but the Title track boast Prog with a Capital P without sounding arty before diving into a Disco beat. I don't know how someone who was supposedly drugged to the Eyeballs could come up with a track that coherent. <br /> <br />The strangest thing is how he went from STS to Low and pull off a master coup. That sums up Bowie, he simply led the way and managed to bring together rather than alienate music Fans. He could do Heavy Rock/Prog/Disco and still be loved by the Punk fans. <br /> <br />I do not use the word Genius lightly, he is in the that category, <br /> <br />STS is very underrated. If you have not heard it, when you do, you will be listening solidly to it for an age. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Another qreat album from the lovely Mariah Carey! I was actually kind of scared of the out come of this cd, but to find out it was qreat!! Her previous cd kind of suqqested her music career was out the door, but this cd is a qreat come back for her. It shows that no matter how old you qet, true talent will shine, & she's deffinently shininq! Every sonq is awesome in its own little way. I wuld suqqest anyone who loves true talent buy this album!
0060930187|5.0|I actually listened to this book as an unabridged book on tape.  I had severe reservations about listening to/reading it--I had a manic episode several years ago that rates high among my most painful and embarrassing moments.  I thought this book would be too close for comfort and that I would relive some of the most miserable experiences of my life by learning about Syliva Plath's nervous breakdown.  The exact opposite happened: I felt self-compassion instead of self-censure.  Sylvia describes so accurately what it's like to have a break from reality, to lose self-control, and to descend into madness--while not even knowing what's going on. Esther (Sylvia Plath's autobiographical narrator) also becomes increasingly self-absorbed, one of the hallmarks of a manic episode.<br /><br />One of the worst things about manic-depressive disorder/temporary insanity is that people who don't know much about the disease might assume that an afflicted person is always like what s/he is like when ill and take things at face value--fortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth, and most of us who are susceptible to the disease are very different types of people when we are healthy.<br /><br />I can relate to Sylvia's feeling of being dogged by her breakdown and her need to put it in perspective.  It's said that Sylvia wrote \\"The Bell Jar\\" in order to get beyond her breakdown so she could concentrate on her poetry.<br /><br />The Bell Jar distorts perceptions, impairs judgment, disrupts relationships, and looms threateningly over the heads of those in remission--\\"will the bell jar come down upon my head again?\\"  Unfortunately for Sylvia, it did.  However, her book can inspire compassion for the mentally ill and show how even a gifted young student (who seemed to have the world by the tail) can be vulnerable to this illness--no one can assume s/he is immune to mental illness and/or temporary insanity.<br /><br />NAMI (The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) reminds us to love the person, hate the disease.disease.
B000001ESJ|5.0|...this album begins Rush's \\"classic period\\", which I define as 1977-1984.  A Farewell to Kings is a dramatic leap forward from 1976's 2112, and a great one at that.  This is where the beast that is known as Rush, which was born with Fly By Night, and took it's first wobbly steps on Carress of Steel and 2112, matures fully.  The title track starts out with classical guitar before bludgeoning you beautifully, with great lyrics to boot, in one of the most savage solo sections in the middle.  Rush's epic Xanadu, based on an unfinished poem by Samuel Coleridge Taylor, is pure perfection, all 11 minutes of it.  Fantastic, atmospheric, and awesome.  Some shorter songs follow, including the fan (and radio) favorite, Closer to the Heart, Madrigal, and the vastly underrated Cinderella Man.  The album then ends with one of the greatest epics ever, the amazingly intense Cygnus X-1.  This song is so heavy, intense, and downright dark that it freaked me out the first time I heard it.  Powerful, powerful stuff, and one of their finest moments, from the menacing opening to the tight instrumental work, the ethereal lyrics, Geddy's bloodcurdling scream at the end, and the haunting chords ringing out and fading over minutes to end the song.  Great stuff, great album.  Get this!
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is special.  It sounds fresh after many hearings.  The lyrics are often esoteric and cryptic or just plain nonsensical.  \\"A mosquito, my libido\\"?  An albino and a mulatto forging racial harmony?  (Or just a convenient rhyme?) Not exactly clear on Kurt's intent, but interesting and fun to speculate about. I wish he hadn't taken his life, and I hate when people are hard on him and unhelpfully judgemental.  He was only 27, for God's sake...few of us have left behind such a legacy by the time we're 27-years old.
B000001ESN|5.0|...tied with Moving Pictures, but I think I like this one a tad better simply because it isn't the big, huge, well-known one that every casual Rush fan has.  That, plus it is one HELL of an album.  Once again, the production is crisp and clear but not slick, and every instrument and voice and everything is recorded to perfection.  And the songs......The Spirit of Radio is by far the best known tune on here, and deservedly so...it's great.  Freewill, probably my favorite Rush song, is tight and hard with a driving beat, and the middle jam section has to be one of the best ever recorded.  Just listen to the unreal playing from Geddy and Neil during Alex's guitar solo...jaw-dropping.  The lesser known songs on here are exquisite as well.  Different Strings and Entre Nous are great, short songs, and Rush gives us TWO epics on here, the heavy and atmospheric Jacob's Ladder, and the superalative Natural Science.  The latter song I saw them perform the last two tours I saw Rush, and the song still kicks ass.  If you're starting out a Rush collection, I would recommend Moving PIctures first, and this second...or buy them both at the same time and enjoy!
B000002KNI|5.0|This album is awesome and then some.  The lyrics are sung with conviction, tenderness, and passion. From \\"April Come She Will,\\" \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\\" \\"The Sounds of Silence,\\" \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" to \\"Feeling Groovy,\\" few live albums can top this example of confident vocals.  The lyrics are poetry.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I give this DVD a 5-star review because I do think that the movie is great, that this is a wonderful presentation of it, and because I hadn't bought any of the previous \\"special editions\\". HOWEVER, I am in complete agreement with all of the others who are frustrated by the annoying and increasingly common practice of studios releasing ever-so-slightly-different editions and claiming that THAT is the \\"Ulitmate, Definitive, Not to Be Improved Upon, Super Special Edition (Until the Next One Comes Out In 18 Months)\\". I'm not sure what they think that they're achieving, since there are all sorts of movies that I haven't bought on DVD at all because I'm convinced better editions are going to have to come out, and \\"special editions\\" that I WON'T buy, as tantalizing as they are, because I spent the money on the earlier version and can't justify the extra cost for a few features that would be nice to watch only once or twice.
0876855575|5.0|This book was the first Charles Bukowski book that I ever read. After this book, I was hooked on his books. This is the kind of book that once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. His writing style is so clear and simple, but not in a retarded way. This is so much better than all those Shakespeare things you have to read in school. It's very blunt and uncensored and the events that occur in the book are so hilarious and true to life.  <br />The book starts out when the main character (Henry Chinaski) is a kid and continues on into adulthood. His life is so hard and it is easy to identify with him. It's hard to really summarize the plot of this book. It's about Henry Chinaski's day-to-day life and the struggles he faces, including terrible acne, alienation, and depression. You won't be disappointed by this book. And if you don't like it, it's probably because you are trying to be too sophisticated, as this book would not be considered \\"proper\\" or be considered as good reading material for young children. \\"Ham on Rye\\" is a great book whether you admit it or not.
B0009F2C34|5.0|This record has been immortalized in the past few years as the crate-diggers and backpackers bible. Every single year, with another list marking the best of the past 10 years, 50 years, and maybe even millenium, Endtroducing has become a musical canon. Whether this allegation is factually true, it has become a canon for an entire generation of people who bought turntables instead of guitars. And rightly so: This disc is THE essential record for sound collages. The rampant sampling of the eighties reached the nineties with such cynicism that with the release of this record changed an entire generation's idea of what a song is supposed to be like. For the youth of today, the music they listen to is inevitably tinged with the influences of this record. DJ Shadow had taken sampling to a point where only keyboards could replicate the intricacy in which he used records.<br /><br />That being said, Endtroducing stands the test of time, firmly implanting itself in popular cultures lexicon of important records. Endtroducing has far exceeded even the largest expectations: perfect production and album arrangement greeted by overwhelmingly positive reviews and an ever-growing fan base. Some people consider the record an emotional masterpiece, others an aural marthon, and some even think of it as turntablism at its finest. Quite frankly, it is truly the first musically post-modern piece of music in the recording art industry. While certainly neither the first to sample nor investing in a large amount of samples, the direction, focus, and articulation of a generation can be surmised within the record. It is the death and rebirth of the recording industry all at once. Josh Davis captured it perfectly: funk becomes ominous, break-beats become convulsive, instruments are used sparingly, and scratching becomes welcomed. It is a record that cannot be overlooked and cannot be forgotten. Now commemorated in this deluxe edition, we finall get to look at Shadow from the lens by which he viewed the parts that made up his record: antiques destined to die unless someone revives them.<br /><br />The second disk of redos and remixes is like butter on toast. It may not be the most essential thing to have yet it grants further insight into the scope and variety this record can/would represent. From the decidedly dancable overhaul of \\"Organ Donor\\" to Cut Chemist's mayhem of \\"Number Song,\\" the variety of perspectives and directions the album could have taken is immediately apparent. It is the kaleidascope from which to view the world of Endtroducing, granting variety and intrigue to the many pieces that make up this grand collective.<br /><br />Coupled with a live performance at the end of the disc, Endtroducing is finally given the proper platform which it deserves. For fans who have all the vinyl, it can be a redux and a compilation by which to listen to some of the most defining music of the decade. For the unassuming viewer, this record is immediately accessible and mandatory. You're cutting yourself short by missing out on this Deluxe Edition.viewed the parts that made up his record: antiques destined to die unless someone revives them. <br /> <br />The second disk of redos and remixes is like butter on toast.

B00005JNJT|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have seen the film before I read any of the standard assortments of critical reviews out in the press.  I had heard hearsay that Roger Ebert had said that this movie accomplished exactly what comics to movies should accomplish.  Nothing more, just the standard rumblings you'd expect from the standard summer blockbuster.   <br /> <br />This film is not a regular summer blockbuster.  It saves the Batman movie genre single handedly from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tommy Lee Jones and other terrible performances from the past five films based on Batman Comics.  This film is also the greatest achiever in the category of \\"Comic Book based film.\\"  This film beats Spiderman II and X2: X-Men United. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that accomplishes all that it could.  It is an achievement from every element, writing, directing, acting, special effects, and production.  It will be difficult to describe fully. <br /> <br />This film is directed by Christopher Nolan, who also directed the underground favorite \\"Memento.\\"  Nolan holds viewers in this comic book world effortlessly.  The movie is 2 hours and 21 minutes in length, but the viewer doesn't notice this at all.  Even in films that are really good, like the LOTR trilogy, you still feel some dissonance as you realize you've been watching for a considerable length of time.  Not in this film.  There is only great disappointment that the movie has to end.  Nolan accomplishes much in this film, but most of all he brings the viewers into a different world, and keeps them their without complaint. <br /> <br />There are some great acting performances in this film as well.  Christian Bale plays the lead role as the young and troubled Bruce Wayne; he flees to another country before returning to Gotham to try to pick up whatever was left of his life.  Liam Neeson plays Ducard, the man who takes the young Wayne under his wing into a secret Ninja society before he and Wayne part ways and Ducard become an antagonist.  Neeson plays a character caught between good and evil: someone who has noble goals but dangerous means.  He's sympathetic, which makes him the perfect villain in this role. <br /> <br />Oscar winner Michael Caine plays Alfred, the beloved butler of the Wayne family.  Caine's performance overshadows all others, including the abilities of Morgan Freeman, who plays another Bruce Wayne confidant.  The only dim bulb in this cast was Katie Holmes, who does well, but her role is limited as the love interest and damsel in distress. <br /> <br />What makes this story so great is it escapes what I call the \\"superhero problem.\\"  All movies that deal with how a superhero becomes a superhero are boring.  Superman is just an alien.  Spiderman gets bit by a radioactive spider.  The Fantastic Four are hit with extreme radiation.  The X-Men are just mutants, the next step in evolution.  None of this is interesting alone.  Even the non-super power superheroes have boring background stories.  The Punisher is just a guy whose loved ones were gunned down.  While this is the setup for Batman (the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents as a child) it isn't the full story. <br /> <br />Bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the event described in this film.  The persona evolves.  First Wayne tries to understand the man who murdered his parents by becoming a criminal himself, running away to the Orient for seven years.  There he ends up in prison, but is released and studies to become a Ninja at a mountain school under Liam Neeson's character.  The two have a falling out, and Wayne returns home.  His concern for Gotham and Katie Holme's character (a local district attorney) leads him down the path of vigilante-hood. <br /> <br />However, Wayne never fully embraces the idea, the persona \\"Batman\\" until he forced to deal with a super villain, in this movie Scarecrow.  As the movie escalates, we see Wayne evolve.  Despite my description, the plot is very fast paced and interesting.<br /> <br />Sure, there are some weak points.  Christopher Nolan felt the need to intersperse small tidbits of humor at inopportune times.  Some of the plot is wholly unbelievable, but we forgive these transgressions because even a diamond has imperfections, and this film is still a diamond in a sea of cruddy summer blockbusters.  Enough reading already, go see this film! <br />
B0009PVZWI|4.0|I just bought the album today and have listened to it 3 times.  I just wanted to comment on the people I see ripping the 2nd disc - I thought it was the best!!  My girlfriend and I got in an argument right before I had a chance to listen to the second disc (we were following each other in different cars, thank God) and the second disc made me forget all about it!  I seriously think Razor is one of the best songs that I have ever heard.  As for the 1st disc, it's pretty good too - regular old Foo - I'm glad to get something new.  Buy the cheaper disc - it's worth it!  While you're at it, pick up the new White Stripes and System of a Down - I buy pretty much all the new rock and those two albums are GREAT!  The Exies is another sleeper/surprise worth picking up - Enjoy!
B00005JMAH|2.0|I was psyched to watch this movie. I watched it the day it came out. Twice. And i am a huge fan of movies. A movie has to be a real stinker for me to not like it but this one. Its missing a crucial element that many people would call a \\"plot\\" theres hardly any continuation in the story. It starts with him recieving a letter to go to Hogsmeade. Wheres Hogsmeade? Then Aunt Marge comes. Whos she? Us Harry Potter fan know, but someone who doesnt wouldnt have a clue.  <br />I found myself wishing i could pause the film and fill in all the blanks it leaves.  <br />Two huge things are left out of the book. One, the only quidditch final so far that Harry plays in and wins and the other, he is never told that Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were his Dad and his friends, a HUGE revelation in the book.  <br />The only reason i gave this movie two stars instead of the One it heartily deserves is because, it was Harry Potter and no matter how bad, that has to count for something. (Just not much) <br />Just read the book, the movie is so not worth a glance.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've held off on writing this review for awhile, simply because I wanted to savor the album, let it wear on me if it was going to do so, and just generally avoid coming to a hasty judgment on its merits.  I believe that a proper album review should be from a person who's heard the album in question at least a dozen times, spun it again and again until it's sunk in properly. <br /> <br />If I had written this review after my first listen, I would have called Octavarium \\"masterful but slightly uneven\\".  What's odd is, I did fall in love with it the first time I heard it.  I can't say that about any of the other Dream Theater albums, and I've heard them all, extensively.  Dream Theater, without exception, has always had to grow on me.  I've had to take the time to comprehend everything that's going on in the album, to get a feel for the tracks and the lyrics.  All that changed with Octavarium.  Despite some parts that I couldn't get into, I loved most of the album the first time I heard it. <br /> <br />I've only grown to appreciate it more the more I've heard it.  The parts I considered weak have grown on me, though I still don't like them as much as the songs I initially loved (with the exception of The Root of All Evil, which has become one of my favorites even though I was ambivalent about it on first listen). <br /> <br />Dream Theater almost always produces varied (some would say eclectic) albums, but Octavarium really pushes the envelope.  It goes from emotional ballad (The Answer Lies Within) to pop-flavored rock (I Walk Beside You) to blistering metal (Panic Attack) to progressive epic (Octavarium) and everything in between.  Some have accused certain songs of being derivative, saying that Dream Theater are wearing their influences too much on their collective sleeves.  It's a valid complaint in at least a couple places, but the songs are so well-written--arguably much better songwriting than the bands that influenced them--that I personally find it a forgiveable offense. <br /> <br />A more distinct complaint is that drummer Mike Portnoy and guitarist John Petrucci have \\"dumbed down\\" their technical show-offery too much for this album.  For me, it's a welcome change from the far-too-long solo sections on Train of Thought, and it only exemplifies stronger, tighter songwriting, and the willingness to service the song over personal pride.  Dream Theater have already proven time and time again that they can play; perhaps it was time that they prove that they can suppress their virtuosity in favor of good songwriting. <br /> <br />The most apparent mark against this album is its lyrics.  They range from terrible to to decent (and mostly mediocre).  Is this the same band that wrote \\"Voices\\"?  And what's so bad about giving bassist John Myung a shot again?  The lyrics in this album are mostly simple and obvious, and they're occasionally ridiculous and somewhat nonsensical.  There are some rare good moments, like in Petrucci's \\"These Walls\\", but they're few and far between. <br /> <br />It's fortunate, then, that singer James LaBrie gives by far his best performance to date.  He demonstrates great versatility and the ability to adapt to different styles, and gives arguably his most emotional and convincing performance yet.  So even when the lyrics look terrible on paper or when considering them afterward, it's hard to argue against them when listening to LaBrie sing them. <br /> <br />This is Dream Theater's most accessible album.  You won't find many several minute solos here (though there are some long instrumental sections in the title track); if you want to introduce someone to the band, this is the album to recommend. <br /> <br />Octavarium is not typical Dream Theater.  It's less about virtuosity than it is about simply good songs.  But they're very, very good, and that makes this one of my favorite albums by the band.
