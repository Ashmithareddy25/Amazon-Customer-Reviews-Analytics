B00992CF6W|4.0|The app is awesome! It just keeps crashing and causing<br />other apps to crash too. But don't get me wrong. It is a great game and I recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|The Grey is a gripping tale that on the surface level is about doing whatever it takes to survive. On a deeper level, it asks the question, \\"What does it mean to choose to survive vs. deciding to throw in the towel?\\" What motivates that decision, and is choosing one way better than the other? The answer that unfolds during the course of the movie seems to be that for every person the answer is different. The movie rises way above the simple, cliched message that our purpose is to persevere and survive no matter what the odds. It makes the case that while in any given situation one person may continue to fight with resources they didn't even know they had, another person may decide that they've had enough, and their reasons for deciding that may be very good ones that they need not feel ashamed about. In any given moment, every person has to make his or her own decision about whether it's worth it to carry on. The Grey explores the issue of survival for mere survival's sake, and prompts us to ask ourselves if that's really what life is all about.<br /> When I watched this movie on Netflix, I was surprised to see that it had been rated at only three out of five stars. The film definitely deserves at least a four out of five--I personally rated it a five. I think I understand what turned some people off about the movie. Towards the movie's end, it has the opportunity to take a  very cliched, harmless and simple way out, but it does not do this, which I was very happy to see. I have no doubt that many people who saw this film (many with religious leanings) wanted to see the cliche fulfilled, and I'm glad that they were disappointed. It's not right to rate a movie low simply because your personal biases and beliefs were not validated by the film.<br /> This film can be highly recommended based on the cast performances alone. And no, it's not a movie about some kind of Super Wolf. I highly recommend it, and leave you with this: make sure you sit through the credits.
0345803507|3.0|This last installment of the series was not as intriguing as the other 2 books.  The book is slow moving and did not hold my interest like the other 2 books did.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game, with really nice graphics. Sound makes a crackling sound sometimes, but its not constant. Very enjoyable game to play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was an excellent, easy, but entertaining read.  I do like how amazon grouped the first 5 books together for us kindle users.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I have not read the book, so I can't compare it to that. I enjoyed it and found it entertaining. My wife liked it as well. If you don't like fantasy or vampire related stories, then you may not like it. Watch the trailer first. If you like the trailer, you'll like the movie. I found the story creative and interesting the way they tied monumental history with vampire fantasy.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|If you have nothing else to do, this is an ok game.  very slow and they want you to but more coins. I use up the free coins each day and try again the next.  only got the app because it is free.  Would not pay for this game.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I have wanted to be a runner for years but I kept hearing the reports over and over: Running is BAD for you! Reading this book inspired me to go out, grab a pair of minimalist shoes (thank you Barefoot Ted), and head out onto my local running trails.<br /><br />Christopher McDougall packs the book with interviews from doctors, nutritionists, and great ultrarunners. He not only writes the story of one of the greatest runs ever held, but inspires every day people like myself to give running another shot.
B003VS0CYC|4.0|Actually, I ordered this item for my adult son. He is very happy to have it. He has enjoyed these movies greatly.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|the game is great!! however it has frozen in middle of playing on my kindle fire and I am unable to get it reset. beware...
B009UQCD0K|5.0|Robert Kirkman does a fantastic job of writing the stories of the comic book into the show.  AMC has produced a never-ending  survival horror masterpiece that never fails to please.  Even the slow episodes are fun to watch...even if they're not as much fun to re-watch.  The human story makes it great for even non-zombie fans.  Prepare yourself to witness brutal loss, shocking decisions, and tense human drama.  It is quite possibly the best show ever produced for television.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The concept of recruiting senior citizens to fight an off planet war and then never be able to return to earth is great! I highly recommend this book and Scalzi.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|the movie was all it was hyped up to be.  the wife and I were excited to see this once it went digital and movie did not disappoint.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Quell Reflect is an excellent game for people who like challenging puzzles without the stress of time limits/bad music. Still the hint function is good to call on when you get stuck.
B009DQQF7Y|4.0|I enjoy this album as I have past GYBE releases. It hasn't blown me away like it seems to have with other people, but I do agree that GYBE are pretty much head and shoulders above all others in the sweeping, cinematic post-rock category. It's good to have them back in top form.<br /><br />The two epic songs are pretty much exactly what you'd want from them, and I enjoy the shorter, more \\"ambient\\" pieces as well, even if they don't \\"go anywhere\\". They aren't covering any new ground here, but it's a fine record that should satisfy any fan.<br /><br />*A note to anyone who downloaded the digital version prior to 10-26-12:<br /><br />About 14 minutes into \\"We Drift Like Worried Fire\\", there's a somewhat arrhythmic clicking sound in the background much like what you'd hear from a damaged CD or a rip from a damaged CD. There is also a fairly pronounced \\"pop\\" or two somewhere in there that to me sound like digital artifacts from a bad rip.<br /><br />Amazon has since fixed the issue, and the fixed version should have replaced the damaged one in everyone's Cloud Drives.
B008NABUU8|5.0|hard levels. even got my girl friend addicted. think outside the box. works great with galaxy nexus. hope for more
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Lets sum up the mystery and enigma of Bob Dylan in some of the wizards newest spinning of wordery... like; \\"I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face --- gonna bury my face between her breasts\\" etc.<br /><br />Dylan continues to weave his tapestry of care free style, slight mockery of self, and a general playfulness towards American history and contemporary culture.<br /><br />For any Dylan fans out there who are still living in the cave since 1966's Blonde On Blonde album (and there ARE still a few) I'll tell ya right now that Dylan has progressed in a long road of ups and downs in the last 45 years and thirty some albums... to quote some lyrics from the sixties... He's younger than that now...<br /><br />This is the 5th album from the 'Jack Frost Years' of Bob Dylan. Bluesy, rockabill type old fashioned jam stuff for most with classics like DUQUESNE WHISTLE and my fave NARROW WAY, then an unfoldment into folk with a fifteen minute dark interpretation of a Gordon Lightfoot type ditty written by Dylan as he watched Titanic in his underwear... and finally a pop hit to be about the great John Lennon called ROLL ON JOHN which I anticipate will be covered sooner or later by some current kids in the biz...<br /><br />Dylan is getting older, and a little more ragged for sure, but he doesn't stop using it to his advantage. Bob Dylan aka Jack Frost the creepy old crazy boy... his lyrics still grab me and pull me in... KEEP ON LIVIN MAN!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Because I graduated from high school in 1972, I loved the cars, fashions, culture!  I thought it was loads of fun and Johnny Depp is amazing as usual.  Great flick!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Battery HD is grate. Because it hallways reminds me of how much battery I have so I can have before I have to plug it in.
B00943SQCI|1.0|Top of my list of movies I wish I DIDN'T purchase at full price.  *shakes head*  It wasn't funny or entertaining.  I didn't see the point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun its kinds like temple run but yet at the same time its totally different I love the game though
B0083SBJXS|2.0|What burns me about this order is that the price dropped on the deluxe set AFTER I pre-ordered this version; the four disc deluxe version with digital copy dropped its price to the point that it was only about 2 dollars more, and I had already ordered this 2 disc version! Needless to say, I WON'T be pre-ordering again; I'll wait for the price drop that I got screwed on!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|First of all, I'm glad that the show has evolved since the last two episodes of season 2 into this (and episode 2) where you knew they were going to HAVE to get off of the farm. I thought the beginning of season 2 was slow-paced and while I'm glad they built some relationships between the characters, I was getting to the point where I needed some new scenery and action.<br /><br />\\"Seed\\" delivered that, as they make their way to a prison in order to find shelter and food, as well as to allow Lori to give birth safely. I was excited to see the ending, which I won't give away, and the action leading up to the ending in the prison yard. Lots of killing to be had, and some more challenging walkers to deal with (prison guards with protective gear on).<br /><br />As for the part I dislike, if you haven't watched the episode and don't want spoilers, I'd stop reading right about now...<br /><br />I really disliked the way in which Hershel was bitten. Prior to this episode, the zombies were NOT intelligent creatures (as seen in the CDC, their brains become completely dysfunctional, they can only move and eat basically). They did not surprise anybody with their presence very well, because they groaned and walked towards the humans as soon as they heard one. The zombie that bit Hershel had been stepped near and over a few times during the chase scene, but didn't move UNTIL Hershel was just stepping over it. I wish that wouldn't have been the way it happened, it seemed like that was exactly what AMC's writers did NOT want to portray the zombies as being.<br /><br />Other than that, satisfying episode, and a great start to season 3. Can't wait to see what happens in episode 3 on Sunday!
B008NABUU8|5.0|If you like bridge building games you will enjoy this one.  The problem with this game, as many others is that there's only like 20-25 levels.
0451205766|4.0|I found the book entertaining and did enjoy it. However, I believe this to be the rare case where the movie is better than the book. I felt Coppola omitted all the things that keep this book from being great. I understand the Puzo was trying to make money, but Mancini... really? Come on...
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My computer was beginning to sound like a freight train and would shut down if I let it operate for long periods of time.  Once I applied the product to my processor, these problems vanished. A simple procedure for such a big impact!  I am quite satisfied.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not impressed!!! Actually took the edge off my knives.  I have used an Aladdin sharpener for 30+ years and thought perhaps time to purchase a new sharpener.  After receiving this I ordered another Aladdin from Amazon and very happy.  Now I have two Aladdins as the original still functions, just not as well but better than the Smith.
B000I57HTY|4.0|One of my top 10 favorites for posing the questions of personal choice, living into personal values and persevering thru adversity. One of Heath Ledger's best performances. Sweet and moving and certainly thought provoking about loyalty, friendship. love and forgiveness. Compelling visuals and unspoken questions about war in general and what it asks of young men. It's on my keeper list for sure.
B003WTE886|4.0|You must work on a better way to package CD. 80% of the time my jewel cases are damaged.  This one was pretty bad.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the first book a little slow in the beginning and it took me quite a few attempts to actually get into the book. This book was easier to get into and I don't know if it is because I read the previous two and was now  interested or if it was just easier to get into. I didn't see this ending coming at all!
1469984202|5.0|I read somewhere (I think Hugh Howey's blog) that he wrote the first Wool and quietly released it, expecting nothing. The next thing he knew, people were wanting more. Regardless of where exactly I heard it, I know that it was him explaining this so I feel confident sharing that bit with you.<br /><br />I rarely write reviews. I rate a book and leave it at that because, well, everyone gets different things from reading the same material. So why am I writing this review? Because I loved these stories and I want to support an author who I think has done a stellar job at writing dystopian short stories that actually interest me.<br /><br />I love dystopian works of any kind (movies, comics, books, etc). I love short stories from select genres. My great love for reading is based mostly in the ability a story has to transport me somewhere else, somewhere impossible for me to go on my own. In a dystopian short story, I don't find that I get that same feeling.<br /><br />Hugh Howey's Wool series, however, does just that. I found myself wanting to walk the same time worn stairs, feeling the dread and exhilaration of sending another person out for cleaning, and the stifled feeling of having been in the silo for one's entire life. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves the thrill of a good read.
B004FDPOHC|3.0|I really only enjoyed about four of them. Consider listening to the music on you tube and just purchase individual songs. It would be cheaper in the long run.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Dont' read this book if you are offended by abundant use of curse words and crude sexual references.  That said...the story is intriging and Rowling's writing skill is evident and enjoyable.
B003XDXNOQ|4.0|I have a pair of these and love them.  This pair, however, was too small (although the same size I already have).  I returned them.  Next time I want to try them on before I buy!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book for the first time two years ago, and it changed my life. i could relate to Charlie so much . i'm using a quote from this book in my application to Yale.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|People have complained that the movie is a parody of the original show, but I don't agree...certainly it has a lot of humorous moments, but it also has its share of dramatic scenes. I would term this as a 'dramedy.'<br /><br />The cast is great, especially Johnny Depp as Barnabas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth, and especially considering they both had some really big shoes to fill from Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett, the original Barnabas and Elizabeth from the show.<br /><br />Eva Green is deliciously nasty as Angelique, but she also shows she still has a soft spot in her 'love' for Barnabas despite the fact she has managed to ruin his family for generations in revenge for his rejecting her.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tribute to an iconic show at least in my opinion. I can watch it over and over again.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I am so glad I found Lana Del Rey and took the risk of buying this album.  The sound is so fresh and different, yet somehow maintains an almost classical note to her songs.  The sound and her voice have an almost classic sound, whereas her lyrics are refreshingly young and, to say the least, different. Many of her songs start with a beautiful music intro and with a slower pace, but she inserts quick, quirky choruses into the middle that wouldn't seem like you were listening to the same song and yet is tied together so well.  I really think Lana is a brilliant artist and I can't wait to hear more from her!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the best series of Ken Follett. Can't wait for the third book. It's easy to remeber the characters and they pull you right into the story.<br />There is a lot of history of World war 2 and what suffering went on during the war and trying to stabilize their goverments<br />I bought this book for my e-reader and will share it with my spouse. He loves the Ken Follott books too.<br />I purchased this through Amazon.

030758836X|5.0|The book is a page turner with twists and turns that were carefully disguised. After reading Gone Girl, I bought two other books by the author.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have chosen 5 stars for this book  because it is unique, compelling and I couldn't put it down. The momentum of the plot never slowed down  and the ending was satisfying. I had no idea that I was reading science fiction until the end. It reminded me a little of the first Planet Of The Apes.  Totally different but with a similar feel to it. I recommend this book to people who enjoy suspense  and take an interest in mutation and survival of the fittest.
0062127241|3.0|Who fans should read this- there's a lot of interesting band history to be found within. But take it all with a grain of salt. It's a memoir, after all, and even though Pete appears willing to &quot;tell-all&quot; (i.e. while admiring Mick Jagger's package, Pete 'admits' that Jagger is the only man he ever really wanted to f*&amp;*), he doesn't endear himself to this fan. In fact, in many ways, he comes across as the egotistical jerk we fear he might actually be. For example, as an excuse for being a negligent father and husband, he plays the &quot;I was a rock and roll star living a rock and roll lifestyle, so what else could I do&quot; excuse too often. Pete Townshend deserves a huge amount of credit and respect for his role in Rock n' Roll music, as an innovator, as a song-writer, and as an inspired performer. Beware of getting inside the mind of someone who is constantly offering rationalizations for behaviors.<br /><br />He also takes a little too much credit for his &quot;invention&quot; of the power chord and the introduction of the suspended chord into popular music. Neither of these claims hold much water. And he places the Who, as high as they deserve to be, into the stratosphere when it comes to a 70's stadium drawing phenomenon. Too often it's all about The Who and the Stones were the only ones around; he must have forgotten a band named Led Zeppelin was outselling them both in concert tickets sales between 72 and 75. He also gives credit to the Who as the first to use lasers in concert; again, Zeppelin was doing this before them, albeit by only 8 months, but still, before the Who. Am I nitpicking? Maybe, but facts are facts.<br /><br />Pete tends to throw his bandmates under the bus quite a bit. One example: according to Pete, Roger was the only member who had a problem with Kenney Jones as Keith Moon's replacement. The place I drew the line with credibility: Pete's very sudden mention of being a heroin addict- he spends several pages talking about a cocaine habit and his longstanding drinking problem, both of which he gives half-hearted attempts at rehabbing. Then, out of the blue, almost as an aside, he states he needs help breaking a prescription drug and heroin habit...?!? Not sure how you just drop this in, with no further or prior mention of the word, but that's what he does.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Pete is truly introspective, intelligent, and talented individual. I guess my problem is as much with the memoir genre as it is with this particular one. How does anyone really give a faithful, accurate account of the meaningful events in their lives without pushing an agenda? Pete just can't seem to get his agenda straight.caine habit and his longstanding drinking problem, both of which he gives half-hearted attempts at rehabbing.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely incredible that this app is available, and is FREE, and has so many features.  when I have wifi, I have dozens of translations and my One Year Bible reading plan on my Kindle Fire--no need to lug my big Bible on business trips (though I still love my traditional Bible for study and notes). When I don't have wifi, I still have over a dozen translations downloaded to the Kindle...super handy in church.  Simply amazing that this is available as a free app!

Mr Porter's voice is simply amazing and the songs were so unique.  We especially loved \\"When Did You Learn\\"  and \\"Be Good\\".  If you like the soothing sounds of a mellow baritone voice, this is it!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Wow I don't know what all the hype was about over this movie?  As far as I'm concerned it should be classified as a comedy vice SciFi.
0345803485|3.0|Badly written with unbelievable characters the only reason I give this 3 stars is because E L James managed to make most of the sex scenes erotic without seeming smutty. Perhaps that's why so many women have bought this book.<br /><br />Even had this book been worked over by a good editor it still would have missed the mark. In my opinion it had the potential to reach the depths of dark... shame it didn't even get half-way there but turned into a trite love story instead.<br /><br />J M Leitch, author of futuristic thriller The Zul Enigma.
B003UESJ9M|2.0|Recently released from a rehab facility, Kelly (Paltrow) is essentially the Nashville Lindsay Lohan.  A drunk, pill-popper.  Pretty much exactly like Lohan, except more pretentious and irritating.  Anyway, she limps through a comeback to Grammy-level music, despite the fact she's less talented than Dewey Cox and her singing voice is similar to Marlee Matlin's.  While managing to alienate her husband (Tim McGraw), cheat on with with her rehab sponsor, struggling singer Beau (Garrett Hedlund), and embarrass herself in front of one of the few disillusioned fans she has left - Chiles Stanton (Leighton Meester), another up-and-coming country artist - she also manages to make viewers, those of her country performances and most who watched the movie, dislike her immensely.<br /><br />Hedlund and Meester provide the best performances, impersonating country singers quite well.  I've been to The Stage on Broadway in Nashville, and while it's certainly more crowded than portrayed in the movie, Hedlund sounds like someone who could play there regularly.  Tim McGraw once again turns in a nuanced performance, even though the source material is right in his wheelhouse.  A lot was made of Paltrow actually singing in the film, but the singing ends up being very unimpressive, which is consistent with the rest of her performance.  And frankly, most of her movies.  She was at most the third best singer on screen, and that's only because McGraw never dropped a note.  In a sort of schadenfreudian way, I enjoyed disliking Paltrow in this movie, but it's still not as good as her role in Se7en, but that's because her head ends up in a box and we don't have to listen to her condescending tone and self-righteous thoughst.<br /><br />The title is very misleading, and anyone looking for strength in this film should look elsewhere.  Just like the stereotypical country song, this is a sob-in-your-beer, love-triangle tale missing only the hound dog, the decrepit pickup, a case of Natty Lite, and actual, believable emotion.ctual, believable emotion.
1401324649|5.0|What a well-written, humourous and unique book!<br /><br />Set in Sweden, but describing episodes taking place all round the world, the hero is a 100 year-old man who does a runner from his retirement home just before his 100th birthday party. He gets mixed up with a suitcase full of cash, murder, the underworld, a hot-dog seller and an elephant while being chased by the law. Through a series of flashbacks, the reader is acquainted with the incredible but absolutely unintentional influence this unpolitical man has on world affairs as he inadvertently meets the movers and shakers of the 20th century.<br /><br />This is a delightful book.<br /><br />J M Leitch, Author of futuristic thriller The Zul Enigma

B009SRJA0W|4.0|With the plot arcs of the eighth season of Supernatural firmly established, Supernatural takes a break to go back to \\"hunting things, saving people...the family business.\\" In this case, murder victims are turning up with their hearts ripped out of their chests. And other people involved seem to have received organs from the same source. In this episode, Supernatural mines Mayan mythology which hasn't been explored yet in this solid win of an episode. Recommended. A-.

B009WJX10G|5.0|I was blown away by this episode of Supernatural, which shows Sam and Dean completely as incidental footage on a college student's video project. It isn't that Supernatural hasn't gone here before, they have in the Ghostfacer's episodes, but in Bitten, Supernatural executes this meta-narrative in a new and unique way.<br /><br />The episode follows three college students, let's refer to them as the handsome guy, the geek and the beautiful girl they both love, which sets up the usual triangle, but it feels universal rather than hackneyed. Strange things are happening at the edges of their movie - a neighbor is murdered and the one witness swears they heard growling as well as screaming. Then, while out in search of more footage, the handsome guy is bitten and begins to develop amazing physical powers. Now the student's  movie is about understanding the jock's powers and exactly what happened. The dynamic between the three students, encompassing pity and love and humiliation is used very effectively. Again, it feels like human experience rather than cliche.<br /><br />What happened, who survived and how Sam and Dean finally zero in on the students as central to their case rather than peripheral witnesses makes for an amazing story. Supernatural really has gotten a huge dose of new energy in its new show runner. After a couple of years of watching out of habit I am once again a dedicated fan. A+.

B006TVQTHW|5.0|I have generally gone for the smaller and more compact cases and after getting this one for my new rig I am wondering why.  This case is a decent sized case and it is a bit wider than most, but that is because of the great cable management system this has available.  I was able to route nearly all of my cables *behind* the montheboard and out of site.  It looks beautiful in there (makes me wonder why it doesn't have a window to show it all off!).  If you want a sleek case with a lot of nice internal features (cable management, a place to mount an SSD, side facing HDD bays etc...) then this is definitely the case for you.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one of the most complex novels I've ever read. During the first few chapters, I was annoyed with Amy and the sing-song quality of her narration. I kept asking myself, \\"What's all the fuss about this book?\\" But the more I read, the more I understood and it really hit me at about 45%, after which I could not put the book down. For the first half of Gone Girl, I felt sort of uncomfortable while reading until I realized why. It's the writing - it's so hateful and angry. It makes you feel like you're the dinner guest of a spatting couple and can't escape. But it's more than that; it's malicious and hateful and you want to turn away from it. Once I realized where the 'sour taste' was coming from (and that it wasn't directed at me!), I really got into the story of Nick and Amy. Every time I thought I had an idea where the story was going, something happened to direct me somewhere else. Flynn's writing is masterful; the characters she created are practically indescribable (they're that baffling). And what's more is that she created two people who understand each other so well, whose twisted minds are so perfectly matched, that it seems inevitable that they will self-destruct. Nick and Amy are totally dysfunctional as a couple and as individuals, but they are soul mates. Are they better off apart? Or do they need each other to balance the crazy? As for the much debated ending, I thought it was perfect. Definitely read this book.

0307730697|1.0|Ugh. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why this book was getting such high reviews. At first I thought it was the religious angle. A case where you write a few times how much you love Jesus and how Jesus helped you in life and all of sudden every religious nut is giving you glowing reviews for that and that alone, but the thing is the book is not overly reliant on religion and it is merely just brought up here and there as needed in relation to explaining his life. In other words I didn't feel like there was any kind of religious theme or agenda but rather just an honest attempt to fully explain a guys life who just happen to be religious. So I ruled that theory out.<br /><br />I think people are just legitimately drawn to the idea of Adam and his story and I think that is occurring because they are giving that story much more weight then they should since they are unfamiliar with his experiences. As someone who has been to BUD/S and also been around drug culture I could understand the experiences described in the book and I was not impressed with the story or with Adam. Please don't misunderstand me, I do not have an axe to grind or an agenda, I really tried to see what others were seeing and feeling with this story but I just couldn't. First, drug addicts are pathetic and I don't think should be given a chance in the military let alone the SEALs (which is evident by Adam's \\"relapses\\"). I don't like how the author and the story acts as if you are powerless to drugs and have no chance. The truth is there are drug users and drug addicts. The vast majority of people who use drugs do so in moderation, whereas a small percentage of drug users are these really pathetic undisciplined losers who allow themselves through massive personal failings to become addicts. Adam was the latter and I was astonished this type of individual was allowed in and allowed to stay in the military (let alone the SEALs) as I have found addicts to have deep personal permanent character flaws and not just something \\"to work on\\".<br /><br />Second, the author routinely singles out Adam as being exceptionally unique but this couldn't be more from the truth. Saying stuff like \\"Adam was the only person ever to push his body so hard his body failed\\" makes me think that the author has a complete misunderstanding about BUD/S or is outright lying to sell Adam. The fact is almost everyone at BUD/S, both graduates and quitters, push their bodies to breaking point all the time which is evident by all the broken legs, backs, and ankles. What most people don't know is there are probably more people who get injured out of BUDS then actually quit. Adam was not unique. The only thing I saw unique were his atrocious times to his physical tests (which sadly do get overlooked by instructors if they like you... so much for selective-ness).<br /><br />The author lists fairly mundane childhood experiences of Adams about football teams and friendships that while are nothing to criticize, are certainly not worth putting to print or worth my time reading about (I felt the first 100 pages to be rather a time waster).<br /><br />I like how the author told the SEAL story from a humanists point of view telling the story of the man behind the SEAL instead of focusing on just the typical SEAL stuff (I can't tell you how sick I am of reading about BUDS), but I wished he picked a different man.<br /><br />I think there is a reason this was published by a Christian book publisher and not a mainstream publisher; because it was not near worthy of a mainstream publisher. I am happy many have found inspiration from it and that they love the book, but for me I need more then \\"I made my life hard, Jesus saved me\\".<br /><br />I loved No Easy Day and Lone Survivor but I felt I wasted my time reading Fearless.

B000FC12YQ|3.0|When a wealthy man is found stabbed to death, the suspects include his adopted son, his greedy sister-in-law, various houseguests and servants, and a mysterious blackmailer. Bereft of his usual aide Hastings, Poirot makes use of the narrator, the town physician.<br /><br />I knew whodunit before I started the book, so it was more a case of \\"but he couldn't have done it\\" than \\"who could have done it?\\" And Christie successfully baffled me through most of the book. Not many of the characters were particularly likable, and it was curiosity about a book that set so many of her readers howling that kept me reading, more than the plot itself. I particularly objected to Christie's use of suicide as a \\"solution\\" to major life problems. Spelling, grammar, and formatting were fine, and the title was certainly relevant to the story.
B0091REZMW|3.0|ok game much like cityville and the others that u need to spend money on to get further in the game.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This is a great running game with almost safe to say best graphics&sound out in the market.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, difficulty is alright.

You should have checked before you actually PURCHASE (means PAYING for) it.<br /><br />Please stop complaining about how this game is designed and how it does not fulfill your needs. This game is meant to be like this and it's your fault that you purchased it without looking at anything.<br />Reviews and sneak peaks about this game was out for weeks ago before this game released.<br /><br />Please consider what you are paying for if you have any concern about your money.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Well, I must confess first that I waited with abated breath until this latest book of Kate Morton's was published. My all time favorite book is The Forgotten Garden. I think I've read it ten times. Have actually lost count.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper is a story about a well-known actress who witnesses a crime when she is sixteen. That event haunts her and drives her to unravel its mysterious history as an adult. As her mother lays dying, she goes to great lengths to uncover the motivation behind that crime. In her discovery, it leads her to unlock her mother's great secret.<br /><br />We all harbor secrets; some so well buried that our children don't even know about them. But few of us have one as mesmerizing as the one Kate Morton presents. Before I read the story, a critic said she unfolds her mysteries too soon--plays her cards too soon--so maybe she took that criticsm to heart. She does not unlock the mystery until the very end here and then BAM, the reader has to pick themselves up off the floor. As I read, I had to go back to see if the words on the page were actually what I was trying to comprehend.<br /><br />Now that I've read it a second time, I see where she drops most of her red herrings and I thank her all over again for such a tantilizing ride.<br /><br />My question now is: When and what is she writing for us next? May I put my pre-order in now? If you love mysteries like I do, I have only three words to say: Read. This. Book.
0316228532|1.0|First I want to say I am a huge J.K. Rowling fan.  I am an avid reader and like a variety of genres.  I was going to buy this book right off the bat for my kindle and at the last moment decided to just download the sample.  Thank goodness I did!  What a waste of money!  I am not a prude but this story so far includes a family that uses extremely foul language, a son who wants to kill his father, and a high school boy who gets an erection on the school bus is just not my kind of reading enjoyment.  This book is far below Rowling's talent.  If you like this kind of sleeze, vulgarity and sexual innuendos then go for it.  I would have given this a half a star if I could have and won't even finish the sample. Waste of my time.  If she comes out with another book I will know to check it out first and not just assume it will be good since she has so much talent.
B008P76VXU|5.0|Whenever a great work is summarized, or truncated,  the serious reader or listener is skeptical.  The Ring in its glorious 16 hour stretch is a feast for the converted, but often is too much for a  beginner trying to grapple with a large and complex cultural monument.  The Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Lorin Maazel  plays direct quotes from the Ring that are lifted from the orchestral score of the four operas in the order in which Wagner composed them.  The result is a highly organic presentation of the major leitmotifs and important orchestral interludes of the Ring. As such it is an important achievement which will help in  promoting The Ring and winning for it a new generation of admirers.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that Maazel in stitching the excerpts together did not alter anything that Wagner wrote, nor did he add any superfluous material.<br /><br />The result is a compelling sonic  introduction to the musical building blocks of The Ring.  I would have added subtitles to the film which would identify what elements of the RIng were being presented as they were being performed in real time.  This information is available in the notes which come with the DVD, but how much more enllighting they would be if they appeared on the screen as the musicians were playing each excerpt.  This improvement  would be welcome especially by teachers who use the DVD as part of a lesson plan on Wagner's compositional devices and orchestration.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000VUCIZE|1.0|As i read this book by Sam Harris(the end of faith) i found myself thinking that Mr Harris is unfortunately very well discribed in Psalm 14:1. I found the tone of his writing and the content of his writing to be very much like that of a 13 year old telling the world that he is smarter and better informed than his parents on all issues. He certainly embodies the words \\"thinking themselves to be wise they became fools.\\"I consider the money I spent on his book and the time I spent reading it to be a total waste.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books!! I couldn't put them down until they were done!! The last book wasn't as hot and steamy as the first two but the story ended well. I can't wait for a new book from this author.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I downloaded this game for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves it play it on the actual machine at Chucky Cheese.  Playing it on my Kindle Fire was a bit different so by the time she figured out a strategy the initial coin allocation was low.  It was at that point when we discovered we had to purchase extra coins; I had looked for that information in the product summary prior to downloading and didn't see it.  The game does give the player a few coins at a time when the game is not in use, but not in the same quantity as at the beginning.  I doubt she'll play it much now due to the wait time for one or two coins.
098555780X|2.0|Usually when you can't complete something you take a break from it and try it again later, maybe even try another project in the book that looks like its simple. I tried this method and what i found was that I went cover to cover in a day of things that I was able to do. I am a beginner and have only been tying for about a week and I thought maybe this book would be good for me since it has so many good reviews, I was wrong. I feel like I wasted 10 bucks for a few ties that I can do and all the rest of them are sitting there taunting me. I know that the author probably just wants to try to build the tying community up and get more people into it but this book has made me think that I can't do it and at this point I'm seriously considering giving it up after a week. the book itself is done well, the pictures are a nice touch but sometimes his hands are in the way and you can't see really what he has done or there's other times when he doesn't tell you which end of the rope to pull through the loop among a few other things that just didn't work for me.<br /><br />NOTE: if you are a seasoned knotter and know what you are doing then you will probably like this book. but, if you are just getting started (like myself) and have no idea what you are doing then I would advise you not to buy this book as it will leave you frustrated.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I was glad I did.  The book was great to read on my kindle.  Easy to look up definitions of words.  This author is not afraid of using complex language.  Book is in 6 parts each VERY different from the other.  Each character / part is visited twice.  Feels like it jumps around a lot, but that is part of the fun of reading this story.  I have gotten two other friends to read it and they loved it as we'll.

Recently I decided to dive into this adventure reading both Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry Finn. Being whisked away every evening to a time long ago when everything and everyone moved much slower than today was a  nightly vacation from my hectic life. Tom Sawyer's imagination and independent streak reminded me of myself as a child. Oh, the things we children growing up in the 50's & 60's did without the knowledge of our parents! Now these two novels will remain close to my heart for the rest of my life.

B008XNZMOU|3.0|First off, I have to say that I am a huge Taylor Swift fan.  I think she is incredibly talented.  Speak Now is probably my favorite album of hers with Fearless a close second.  With that being said, I was a little skeptical about this album after she released We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.  While the song is very catchy and I do sing along to it, it's definitely not one of my favorite singles from her.  I can't stand the part where she is talking in the middle of it, but that's just me.  Other people love the song.  I have been listening to the deluxe version of this album for a few days now and I have to be honest, I couldn't even tell you one song that has truly stuck out to me as being a favorite.  They all sound so similar and somewhat boring to me.  There are several songs where the lyrics are very very repetitive which borderline annoying to me.  Overall, it's a decent album but a very disappointing follow up to Speak Now.  But I still love Taylor.

1933633867|3.0|Even by the time one is halfway through chapter 3 of DEBT, THE FIRST 5,000 YEARS, Graeber has yet to put his finger on who produces 'value', a term he throws around quite regularly. Yes, he does tell his readers who see 'value'--humans, obviously.  People see value, they see the use-value of the commodities they trade.  A commodity can have all the labour time in the world in it and if it isn't perceived as having a human use, it will have zero exchange-value. Stick a pin there.<br /><br />Graeber does tell some very important tales in DEBT, pinning the need and therefore usefulness of money on ruling class desires for more wealth than they needed just to live.  In other words, in order to be rulers e.g. to pay for armed bodies of men, through the governing/enforcement structure of the political State. As a means of transferring produced wealth of the peasantry to rulers' ownership, tax systems are decreed by ruling classes which require payment in 'sovereigns'/money. Even so, the confusion accumulates when he poo-poos money itself as being a commodity.<br /><br />Graeber's DEBT is all about definitions. I think he's written a very readable book with many great tales of credit. In addition, he makes definitive statements like, \\"Money is credit, it can be brought into being by private contractual agreements....\\"  And so, we have a self-professed anarchist like Graeber who would like to see the end of the State and the formation of a classless society. According to Graeber, money is the creature of the State. So, without a State, there would be no money.  I think one can surmise this from Graeber's ideology.<br /><br />As Graeber reveals to his readers, the famous bourgeois economist, Lord Keynes, early on in his career made a study of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts which took years of research and resulted in his celebrated treatise on money. Like Keynes, Graeber basically dismisses labour as being the source of value when it comes to exchange.  He goes so far as identifying and trashing Adam Smith's 'labour theory of value' with a sentence early in his book.<br /><br />Why is this important for understanding the theme of the book, debt?<br /><br />Because Graeber embraces what amounts to a consumption theory of value, one which isn't tied to socially necessary labour time; but is more in tune with how price is determined i.e. by supply and demand for use-values. Mike Beggs has correctly observed in his review of DEBT, that Graeber's theory of money is related to 'chartalist' sources. In other words, it's kind of half right. Indeed, Graeber uses his anthropological wisdom to eviscerate the standard bourgeois economic notion that the clumsiness of barter brought about the need for money.<br /><br />As I said, his book is peppered with some great tales, such as the one about Keynes and his years long study of Sumerian texts concerning money, which in turn resulted in one of the good Lord's most celebrated works. But in this reviewer's opinion, it is important to know the source of the production of wealth which is represented by money. And in my opinion that source is to be found in the socially necessary labour time it takes to produce it, for that is the point where economy becomes political. Sure, the State creates money, today's States and yesteryear's States, just as Graeber says. But what does money represent?<br /><br />Debt?<br /><br />Sure. But what is debt, if not the promise to pay in wealth and where does wealth come from?<br /><br />For Marx there are only two sources of wealth, labour and nature. I was curious about Graeber. He's a self-described anarchist. As far as I know, he's still a member of the IWW. He's also touted as a leader of the 'occupy movement'. I wondered how he would solve the fetishism of the commodity in his work, as the commodity, IMO, is the building block of class society and class society is the foundation for the political State and yes, as Graeber says, the political State does mint what passes for the universal equivalent used to exchange commodities and pay off debts.<br /><br />Graeber's anthropological reflections are quite useful in bringing to the fore the notion that barter was rare as an historical phenomenon and money was absent in classless societies of hunter/gatherers. People basically used what they found/hunted. Trade between groups (my commodity for yours) was extremely limited. Those observations by Graeber made sense to me and so the book as a whole is not a total loss.  No, no, no.  Read the book.  In fact it's a bloody good anecdotal romp through 5,000 years of history.<br /><br />For instance, in chapters 3 and 4 of Graeber's DEBT, THE FIRST 5,000 YEARS, we read of enlightening ties between debt, sin, guilt, owing society, owing parents, ancestors and ultimately the creation of money to repay debts to the sovereign. Of course deities can never be totally repaid and many times under absolutist rule, the sovereign becomes a demi-god or even god. All good here.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the way he uses Nietzsche's GENEALOGY OF MORALS, not as dogma, but as a way to illustrate mass religious conceptual ideologies and their cultural penetration into what passes in daily life for normative thinking.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is divided into an examination of each of three themes of human interaction. He starts off with 'communism' and proceeds to define solidarity. The communism that communists know as common ownership of the means of production, production according to ability, distribution according to need is poo-pooed and shelved in good anarchist fashion. In an effort to sell us Graeber-communism (also based on the ability/need axis), he brings us out of the 'communism' of the great beyond (after the State withers away) to the daily praxis of solidarity between humans (up to a point) as being bits and pieces of actually existing 'communism' throughout the ages. According to Graeber, the social revolution is already happening, with co-operation between workers within corporations to get the job done (one not charging the other handing a screw driver to the bloke who needs one to complete the company's job); giving to relatives with no expectation of being paid back but, expecting reciprocal deeds when in need and so on. I can see his point and it's good to read someone who has something positive to say about how we live our lives in communistic behaviour patterns. Of course, he does drag out the ghost of the USSR to scare us away from 'Communism' and this works into his arguing against the conception of 'communism' as any real communist/socialist would define it.<br /><br />No sign of labour being the source of all wealth not found in nature at this point in the book. DEBT remains a stimulating, if often frustrating, read. It made me want to call Davey up on the phone and share ales over conversations about how to change the world.<br /><br />Onward to the next of the three themes of chapter 5, 'exchange'.<br /><br />\\"Originally, human beings lived in a state of nature where all things were held in common; it was war that first divided up the world and the resultant 'law of nations,' the common usages of mankind that regulate such matters as conquest, slavery, treaties , and borders, that was first responsible for inequalities of property as well.\\" David Graeber writes in DEBT, The First Five Thousand Years<br /><br />No David. Private property precedes war. Nevermind--a bloody good read.  Also, the State doesn't come before private property; but after its establishment in the wake of humans' discovery of how to domesticate those plants and animals capable of being domesticated.  Geography has much to do with this, as Jared Diamond has pointed out in his GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL. The provision of a stable food supply, one not totally dependent on hunting and gathering what could be found in nature, was driven by our instincts for survival and freedom, IMO.  Agriculture and animal husbandry began to emerge thousands of years before records began to be written in Sumer.  But back to Graeber....<br /><br />Debt is certainly very important in the establishment of class and patriarchal domination; but when will Professor Graeber recognise in writing DEBT the fact that wealth, to which debt is intimately related, is either a product of labour or exists before us in nature and then is merely possessed by threat of violence through the State's law enforcement hirelings?<br /><br />Maybe I'm supposed to give him a 'huss' and assume that what I'm missing is 'implied'. The problem with that is that while I may see it, others may not, as he dismisses 'the labour theory of value' earlier on in DEBT, with regard to Adam Smith, as I've already stated.<br /><br />Wealth is liberty -- liberty to recreation -- liberty to enjoy life -- liberty to improve the mind. \\"Wealth is disposable time, and nothing more. \\" (From a pamphlet published anonymously in 1821, The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties).  Debt certainly leads to slavery or at the very least to dependency structures woven into the social fabric via culture e.g. the 'milk debt' Graeber outlines with regard to the ongoing establishment of Hinduism in the historical time frame he labels, \\"The Axial Age\\".  But even 'milk debt' involves scads of labour time, in fact, our whole Hindu guided lives, if that's where we're at.<br /><br />Graeber provides his readers with many original source anecdotes concerning the question of slavery which go basically along these lines:  Once upon a time, the producers of wealth believed their monarchs deserved to live high on the hog while they lived lives of poverty. Once upon a time, slaves believed slavery was normal for those defeated in military conflict. All this is true.<br /><br />I kept being frustrated about the questions he raised in my mind about the source of wealth. At the same time I was fascinated by his anecdotes concerning how various cultures dealt with certain kinds of debt. For example, cattle were used as currency for some transactions in pre-State Wales. Women were used in ancient Irish areas for certain forms of debt. Yet, halfway through chapter 6 and still no theory of where wealth comes from.<br /><br />Debt is expanded beyond economic transactions to include sin and other moral questions and while these are cogent observations, Graeber's emphasis on them turns our attention away from what is being asked of those who are indebted.  And what is that but their labour time and giving up their free time in some way shape or form up to and including becoming chattel slaves to those to whom they owed their debts.  Labour time is the source of exchange-value which is wrapped up in the social relations between those in debt and those to whom debts are owed.  And this is precisely what Graeber misses and or dismisses when it comes to his analysis of debt and his continual mystifications regarding money.  For Graeber, money is not based on embodied labour time but on the trust people have in the authorities.  Sure, there is trust; but as the old folk wisdom goes, \\"Where's the beef?\\"  Graeber's rulers seem to just decree what the value of money is as opposed to money being a universal equivalent used to trade objects with exchangeable labour time embodied in them.<br /><br />So, what is value? What is price? What is profit? Graeber continually mixes up exchange-value with a sense of debt which is based on being beholden to another person in some honourable way. I see the connection; but I find his anecdotes confusing the issue. Exchange-value is based on socially necessary labour time (snlt). Humans perceive their own labour time thusly, their own life expenditure in the exchange of commodities. This social perception is born of haggling around price until a sense of 'this is right' is established. But why is it, 'right'? It's the perception of life's labour time in the object or service which is based on the material realityof socially necessary labour time embodied therein.<br /><br /> I'm beginning to be forced to assume that many anarchists want to de-legitmate Marx so badly that they refuse to grasp or have a mental block when it comes to seeing the validity of his critque of political-economy. I saw it in Goldman. I've seen it in other anarchist thinkers e.g. Proudhon. And now, it appears in Graeber. I kept hoping as I read that I'd be wrong in my assumptions.  However, Graeber's analysis of debt is completely tied up in moralist ideology and fogged over with liberal consumptionist oriented economics which just begin to touch on the issue i.e his attachment to the Chartalists and Keynes.  Alas, even the great anarchist Proudhon had his peoples' banks and equality wages schemes for his new society.<br /><br />In chapter 7 of DEBT,The First Five Thousand Years, we find a cogent analysis of honour's connection to owing interest and principle. By using the first Sumerian texts, Graeber takes us in his anecdotal 'way-back machine' to the last social revolution's event horizon at the beginning of history as we know it from Mesopotamian writing around 3000 BC, bringing his reader through to the end of the Bronze Age in 1200 or so BC. Transition from classless hunter/gatherers to farming and animal husbandry took many hundreds of years to complete.<br /><br />Priestly temple sustaining economies congregate in ancient cities, as Sumerian history unfolds. Surplus wealth is appropriated by theocratic cults thus, magnificent temple construction. Through his own interpretation of those first written texts of the Sumerians circa 3,000 B.C., Dr. Graeber opens the door on a time when women were still near political equals with men--as the social relations of power based on class ownership of wealth produced by others, began to take shape in its cradle, newborn civilisation. Patriarchy begins with debt, according to Graeber. A farmer took out a loan to make it till harvest or to get some tool needed for production. That farmer might put up his wife, daughters or sons as collateral. Usually, the debt is paid. However, when it is not paid, 'a pound of flesh' is extracted in terms of the 'collateral' having to do labour time under the lender's thumb. The more loans, the more chances of default to debt-pawn status for the wife and kids. The origins of chattel slavery can be found here. The owning of one person by another becomes normalised in the thousand year historical transition out of the Bronze Age, to the point where even slaves and former slaves endorse the notion that honour is tied to debt. It's a cultural value/norm. And, if one reads closely, one can see the hand of private property rights over class divided wealth emerging: property rights over the product of the exploiteds' labour, along with what was becoming known as his possessions: women and children, in a word, patriarchy. Graeber doesn't put it that way, but it's a valid interpretation of his anecdotal histories, anthropologies, economics, literary interpretations and anarchism as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Graeber often declares that money is the creature of the State and is usually connected with the need to pay the first ancient political State's plundering soldiers.  Fair enough; but that doesn't explain what intrinsic value is embodied in money whether it is paper or gold.  Gold, of course, does contain socially necessary labour time/snlt (although Graeber never acknowledges this in his assertions about fiat money and credit) and paper money is the promise of value creating labour time.  But, Graeber brushes any labour theory of value creation aside early on in DEBT, The First Five Thousand Years.  Money, like value, can seemingly come out of the ether of ruler decrees.  David tells a thousand fine anecdotes but he doesn't explain what the substance of the universal equivalent is and how that substance leads those in positions of political power to be more or less the same peoplewho own private property in the means of production and nature, who own slaves, who make up patriarchal rules bound up with the perceived necessity of keeping private property where it 'rightfully belongs, and to whom debt itself is owed. And how, pray tell, is debt paid off other than through labour time and objects which take snlt to produce or promissory notes promising what....labour time of the debtors.<br /><br />Nope.  The economic theory that he is most attracted to is 'chartalism'. Contemporary economists i.e. since the turn of the 20th century completely abandoned Smith's labour theory of value for political reasons, including the Chartalists. Michael Perleman's work consistently shows this as he is an astute reader of Marx and and the history of modern 'economics'. Check him out. He's well worth the read.<br /><br />Back in the mid-19th century, one could tell that U.S. President Lincoln was still influenced by the labour theory of value as exemplified in his statement, \\"Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not .\\". The political consequences of a President making such a statement today would be EXPLOSIVE!<br /><br />A surplus of any commodity will bring down its price in the market and skills are commodities. What the Black Death did was to lower the supply of labour power and increase its price. Graeber acknowledges this. Ownership of the product of labour is also dependent on access to the means of producing wealth and that access was closed off by privatising what had been the commons during the latter part of the feudal era when the landlord class was riding high. Closing off the commons drove the peasantry off the land (their means of production) and into the urban centres where they were obliged to sell their skills for wages to employers who owned the factories, mines and 'satanic' mills of commodity production. The oversupply of labour power brought about by privatising the commons, brought with it a rise in unemployment, lowering of wages and working conditions and vagrancy laws like those of Henry VIII--vagrancy was a capital crime in Henry's time.<br /><br />What to do with the unemployed?<br /><br />Put them in 'workhouses', debt and pick-pockets' prison; hang them or transport them off to the colonial gulags, America and after the anti-colonial political revolution in America, to Australia where the labour power was needed for exploitation under the wage system.<br /><br />Certainly, one should read Graeber's DEBT; but only after grasping what Marx was saying in terms of exchange-value's connect with snlt.  Reading \\"Value, Price and Profit\\" can help in that regard.  CAPITAL is, of course, more clearly definitive and definitely more enlightening--especially the early on in the chapter on money.<br /><br />I close this review with a powerful observation from Marx which should be kept in mind when reading the final chapter of Graeber's DEBT, The First Five Thousand Years.<br /><br />CAPITAL, Volume One<br />Chapter Thirty-One<br />: Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist<br /><br />The money capital formed by means of usury and commerce was prevented from turning into industrial capital, in the country by the feudal constitution, in the towns by the guild organisation. [3] These fetters vanished with the dissolution of feudal society, with the expropriation and partial eviction of the country population. The new manufactures were established at sea-ports, or at inland points beyond the control of the old municipalities and their guilds. Hence in England an embittered struggle of the corporate towns against these new industrial nurseries.<br />The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised therosy dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations, with the globe for a theatre. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain, assumes giant dimensions in England's Anti-Jacobin War, and is still going on in the opium wars against China.<br />The different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves now, more or less in chronological order, particularly over Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and England. In England at the end of the 17th century, they arrive at a systematical combination, embracing the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation, and the protectionist system. These methods depend in part on brute force, e.g., the colonial system. But, they all employ the power of the State, the concentrated and organised force of society, to hasten, hot-house fashion, the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition. Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one. It is itself an economic power.\\"of socially necessary labour time embodied therein.<br /><br /> I'm beginning to be forced to assume that many anarchists want to de-legitmate Marx so badly that they refuse to grasp or have a mental block when it comes to seeing the validity of his critque of political-economy.

B00913P6G0|5.0|Classic hip hop album that has been stuck in my playlist since I got it. I can't stop listening to it. The expectations were high after section 80, and kendrick delivered in a big way.  The album strikes a perfect balance of a cohesive complete album that does play like a movie, but has various cuts that will lead to commercial success.  Stand out cuts are from start to finish, but my personal faves:  b, don't kill my vibe, money trees, backseat freestyle, maad city, real.
0805095535|3.0|This is the first book I have read by this author, and at first I was not sure I would or could get through the book.  But I did.  What I would have wanted to know about this book before reading it was that it was written in second person narrative.  Second person narrative is the rarest mode in literature -- though quite common in song lyrics. The narrator or writer in this form of writing refers to any one of the characters as \\"you\\", therefore making the audience member feel as if he or she is a character within the story.  And the writer here uses \\"you\\" for himself.<br /><br />At first I was put off by the narrative.  I have not read an entire book in second person and it felt presumptive and annoying.  And because this is a Memoir, it felt less intimate as many other memoirs I have read.  My experience with this book was a back-and-forth feeling.  I like it.  I don't like it.  I like it.  I don't like.  Even now writing this review I don't really know if I like it or don't  That is why I gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />On a positive note, it is written well.  I like that the writing flows and is easy to read.  But the second person thing just kept feeling weird to me for a memoir.<br /><br />That said, there is a lot of wisdom in this little memoir about what it is like to grow old.  To review your life.  And yet there is a lack of joy and gratitude in the authors demeaner and theme throughout the book, and yet perhaps that is the wisdom of this memoir?  Can you feel my lackluster here?  I still am going back and forth about this book.  Hummmm....<br /><br />I do understand that for some people life can be tedious.......  And, but..... I didn't really relate that perspective either.  Life for me is a joyful, exciting and pleasurable journey and place of experience.  So  I guess I am better for the experience of reading this book.... But, reader be warned.  This is  not a book for everyone.  But its okay.

B009F1ZYQK|5.0|I live in M&eacute;xico, I ordered 2 copies from different stores. One is on UMe and the other one is on EMI and I have to say UMe sounds better... they must have better sound engineers... I think I'll sell the EMI one... Another thing, on the back cover it says: \\"These discs are manufactured from vinyl which includes pictures. By nature of this manufacturing process sound quality may be compromised\\"<br />If it's compromised, why the hell do they still make them on picture discs??? Picture discs don't sound as good as normal black or coloured vinyl... Iron Maiden is the greatest metal band and their music deserve a better treatment. HQ vinyl would be great and maybe a 4 vinyl box set of each album like Metallica did with their albums... I'm from M&eacute;xico, but I would spend my hard earned money for these jewels if they're ever released...<br />Packaging, artwork and photos are awesome though...

B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|I've been a fan of Roxette since I was a teenager. Their new albums always represent new ideas in their style of music. Loved their latest album and would strongly recommend it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story took me away from everything which is just what I needed.  I really hated to put it down when I had to, and was so happy to have a Kindle so I could order the prequel immediately!  I'll certainly be looking for the author's other works. and I look forward to a film adaptation.
1455527475|5.0|The overall feeling I had as I finished the book was a positive one, as author Greg Smith is unexpectedly earnest and is trying to be as fair as possible to his former colleagues and bosses. The negative response in the press that \\"there is nothing new in this book\\" does not get the point. Someone from the inside knowledgeable about the financial sector comes out and says this is unhealthy is quite different from observations from the outside. So this is one achievement, and a thoroughly worthy read.
B009471JQE|5.0|ZZtop's new Album La Futura is great rock and roll that I listen to while I work out at the gym.  If you are an old zztop fan then you will love this album and it is a must have.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I'm really sad cause I flipped through the first installment of the Crossfire series, and had really high hopes for this book. Sadly, it didn't deliver! It took me almost 2 weeks to finish it due to several undeveloped story lines that I couldn't get into it. I'm no longer invested in Eva and Gideon and can see the crazy that is their relationship. My advise;  read the reviews, not the book.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|As some other reviewer said, I wish I could get back the time I spent reading this book. The story is meant to be a parable, a lesson, for today's rush-a-day world, and open one's eyes as to how we obsess about time in all aspects of our lives. It succeeds in a minor way, with a handful of mildly insightful comments.  The characters are two dimensional, the leaps of faith (if you'll pardon a pun) and gaps in what little plot there are so slapdash that is is unintentionally comical far too often. The Christian theme is clearly there, so believers might get something out of it that I didn't. Tuesdays With Morrie was a decent book, while this one is way too much of a stretch, a transparent attempt to capitalize on superior prior works in order to gain book sales for this lazy piece of literature. It would never make it otherwise.
B0037EAJAC|5.0|The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen, its a masterpiece with one minor flaw (its a tad too long for my taste) but I digress- If you love epics and political intrigue and Shakespeare but with a Japanese Samurai twist this is for you. For anyone that likes Game of Thrones this is up your alley for sure.

B005USZYDU|2.0|Th kindle edition that I purchased ends abruptly on page 263.  Where is the rest of the story?  I believe the product details say 273 pages, but that still doesn't seem time enough to finish the story . . .
B004LROUNG|4.0|Being a huge Grisham fan, I was hoping this novel had more to do with lawyers, law talk and strategies implemented by lawyers. However, that was not the case.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend reading this novel once. Perhaps my expectations were different, which lead to me being slightly disappointed.
B000000W71|5.0|If you live in the USA you may have missed out on this incomparable virtuoso. This album is a wonderful collection to introduce yourself to Gary Moore. Or, if you already know his talent, there isn't a better grouping of his songs on a single purchase. You'll never tire of the sound of him playing his guitar. I had the video first, bought the cd so I could still listen even when I couldn't watch. Awesome is a serious understatement! Get it, and share it with your friends! I thought I'd heard the best until I recently discovered Gary Moore.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|There have been a lot a bad reviews about this one, but what did you expect?.... Usually, when a film has a title like this one, you don't get very much (I Walked with a Zombie is an exception), so I cannot imagine why so many are so disappointed.... This is actually a pretty good film--similiar to Van Helsing or Sleepy Hollow in the way it looks and the period feel.... There is a lot of action and a lot of vampires--and a decent story--and the blu-ray looks and sounds incredible....definitely worth a look for those who might be interested.... Ignore the whiners....they're just doin' their thing....

0316228532|4.0|\\"But who could bear to know which stars were already dead...could anybody stand to know that they all were?\\"<br /><br />One day, in the small English town of Pagford, Barry Fairweather dies. This leaves a \\"casual vacancy\\" in the Town Council and, more importantly, has a drastic impact in several of the townsfolks' lives.<br /><br />It's probably a rare person who has not heard of J.K. Rowling, the woman who created the boy who lived. I'm familiar with some of her Harry Potter books (the first three); I rather enjoyed them. When I heard about this book, I was intrigued, but to be honest, the cover blurb just didn't sound interesting. I am not a big fan of \\"contemporary\\" novels. The biggest reason I did end up reading this was for my book club. And while there were moments when I thought this book and I weren't going to get along, overall, I was very impressed.<br /><br />But before I get too far, I want to spend a few moments making a few points clear:<br /><br />1) This is absolutely, positively NOT Harry Potter for Adults.<br /><br />2) This book is NOT for children, despite having teenagers starring some pretty major roles. (Maybe OK for mature teens)<br /><br />3) This is not a \\"fun\\" book, filled with magic, adventure and a happily ever after.<br /><br />If you come into this book expecting to read the adult adventures of Harry Potter, filled with magic and adventure, you will most likely leave disappointed (or abandon ship at page 100). For once, the cover blurb does not lie; for fans of Harry Potter and Rowling, I really, really recommend reading that blurb well before diving in.<br /><br />With that out of the way...<br /><br />When I started this novel, I almost got lost. There is an ENORMOUS cast of characters that are slowly introduced. We see their point of view; we watch them go through the day; we see who they interact with and how. The first 150 pages in particular were the slowest, as Rowling is slowly building her cast.<br /><br />But once that cast is constructed--WOW, what an amazing book! Things really start to flow, the book takes shape, and I flew through pages. This book is highly readable, filled with a varied cast of characters and is incredibly well-plotted.<br /><br />My favorite characters were probably Krystal Weedon, Tessa Walls, and Andrew Price--though there were plenty of others (Kay, Gaia, Samantha, Sukhvinder) that were stand-outs. My least favorites were Simon Price (what an @$$!), Howard Mollison (what a creep!), and Stuart Walls (what a brat!). But the thing that both my favorites and least favorites have in common is this: they are ALL well-drawn characters, fully-fleshed, interesting, realistic. Rowling knows how to create characters, ones you love to bits and ones you want to chase with a rake. Lord knows how hard it is to create ONE good character in a novel, but so many? It's impressive.<br /><br />I was impressed with the setting; I've read a lot of books set in different places but haven't really felt as if it were anything extraordinary, almost like those generic towns in old Hollywood movies. Here, the town of Pagford and the Fields almost become characters of their own. They have depth, they feel different and unique.<br /><br />And finally, the story. This is one that is very deeply character-driven, but it takes a while to build. During that time, it can be slow and laborious. But once all the characters are established, Rowling lets them loose to their final confrontation--one that gripped me by the heart and made me want to weep. It was beautifully circular, it was well-written, it was poignant.<br /><br />I am not going to go so far and say this is the best book in the world. I'm sure that if Rowling hadn't wrote this, it would be quietly sitting on a shelf in the bookstore collecting dust and not sending the hype generator into overtime. But that's also not to say that this is a terrible book. I rather enjoyed myself reading this and can't believe how relatively quickly I went through 500 pages.<br /><br />If you are considering reading Rowling's adult venture, I want to make this perfectly clear: this is NOT Harry Potter. Do NOT come into this expecting that same type of story. I also do not recommend this for any but the most mature of teens as there is quite a bit of language, sex, rape, drug abuse, and violence. However, if you come into it realizing what it is and what it isn't, I think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*t through 500 pages.<br /><br />If you are considering reading Rowling's adult venture, I want to make this perfectly clear: this is NOT Harry Potter.

1451695195|5.0|This will be my first review on Amazon. I really felt a strong desire to comment on this book.  I just finished listening to the audio version and... WOW! beautiful!  This is the most inspirational book on the subject of near death studies I have heard in a long time.  Correction, This is the most inspirational book I have heard in a long time period.  I know I should give more details about the book but I'm not a writer.  I just wanted to recommend it.  Thank you for reading. :)
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Wes Anderson's appeal, that is. My husband LOVES Wes Anderson movies, so unfortunately I have been subjected to several of them. The only one I've liked was Fantastic Mr. Fox, which was thanks to Roald Dahl and NOT Anderson. Moonrise Kingdom was arguably the worst of his films I've had to endure. It was a miserable, depressing movie about a bunch of miserable, depressed people. The basic plot - burgeoning adolescent love - was not original or interesting. The characters were awful, despite being played by some fantastic actors (I especially love Tilda Swinton and Edward Norton).<br /><br />Warning: spoiler-ish items ahead.<br /><br />The only remotely likeable character was Sam, the boy, and even he was only mildly interesting. Suzy was atrocious. How is a movie about a girl who stabs another child in the kidney with a pair of scissors billed as a heartwarming, romantic tale? And there were never any consequences for her behavior. Her obvious mental health issues were not addressed. The completely unnecessary killing of the dog was the final flush of the toilet for this film. I also hated that all the adults were portrayed as inept, incompetent, barely-functioning morons. They all looked aged, washed out and depressed, yet little Suzy appears in teeny dresses (or just her underwear) and a full face of make-up in every scene. The make-out scene was painfully awkward, rather than sweet.<br /><br />I could go on and on. I'll just leave at this - I just do not understand what it is about Anderson's films that inspires a cult following.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book! I have really enjoyed reading this series and haven't been able to put the books down! It full of twists and turns and surprises!
0439023521|4.0|Saw the movie first, and got the book from a friend.  Both movie and book are very good.  I would have given 5 stars, but it kind of reminds me of Lord of Flies.<br /><br />This is an intense book.  Love the main characters and how they survive in contrast environments, from the village to the city.  The depth of the book is profound.<br /><br />Look forward to reading the second book before the next movie.
B003HIFV8S|4.0|Character development, both past, present and future, thats what hold's my viewership.  That's what I like about a good story or series.  I stop watching many TV series, especially comedies, because there is no development in the \\"character's\\" character.  In reality, most of the interesting people I know develop and change over the years, hopefully toward maturity and for the better.<br /><br />Another aspect that is true.  When you meet old high school buddies, even though you may have changed, they still try to fit you back into the hole or mold they put you in high school.  Since most public high schools have an anti-intellectual culture, this is especially true if you were considered smart in high school.
B009329Y30|1.0|I thought this was one of the most boring movies I have ever watched.  I didn't even finish it.  The actors were boring as well.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
0399157565|2.0|An ok book I am changing my review becasue the more I red this book the slower pace it got so I am sorry to say that it didn't work out in the end with this book, sorry.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OOOOOOOH My GOSH!  Sylvia Day does not disappoint in this one.  I love it just as much as the first.  It keeps getting better. Def. worth every penny and minute I've spent reading it over and over!

1423140605|4.0|I have read book 1 and 2 this is a very good series but you should frist ready the precy jackson series first then this series because some times this will refor back to the percy jackson series. i am looking forward to reading book 3 and see what happens next but i don't think i be disapoint in this seires. I will try and tell you more after i read it which i am going to start soon.
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading the book since all I heard was it was considered \\"mommy porn\\". But I got the first book and I loved it. I bought the other 2 books and they are just as great. I love the suspense of wanting to know more of what is next.
0828822875|1.0|I picked this book in spite of the fact that it was more expensive than other books with the same name, because I thought it was bigger. The details on amazon say \\"250 pages\\". That is not true. There are only 156 pages. I paid double for what I could have gotten for half price.
159420411X|2.0|I learned about Nate Silver's work mostly from reading his 538 blog in the NY Times and on line.  Thus I was disappointed that he drew so many of the examples in his book from his career as a poker player during the \\"poker bubble\\" and his work as a baseball statistician and so little from his work in analyzing political polls.  As someone who was interested in the proper use of statistical methods to make decisions  during my working life I had already picked up many of the ideas that Silver lays out so clearly in his book,  and really hoped for a lot more insight into the process of political polling and Bayesian decision making in the context of elections such as the current one.  But if you are much more into poker and baseball than you are into politics, you will probably find this a most satisfying read.
1442346272|5.0|This is not the typical book for me.  I don't even know why I was compeled to buy it.  It is motivating, brilliant and although very long--it reads fast.  Congrats to Steve Jobs......your legacy will live on for many, many years.
1451695195|2.0|As a believer in the possibility of the afterlife I was hoping for much more information about the actual experience of going to heaven and what went on.<br /><br />I'm still skeptical of the experience, since the Dr. had no concept of time could all of have happened in the brain in a matter of a split second?<br /><br />It's a great book if you are interested in a family coming together to support one of their own, but that wasn't what I was looking for.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Considering that I usually like scifi movies, Ridley Scott and the Alien series, Prometheus is some particular nonsense. Lousy plot, mediocre acting and virtually nothing to do with the original Alien movies, even though they claim to be the prequel. Sorry to say, but in general: highly disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very engaging.  This was my second time to read it and I could not put it down.
0765316994|5.0|Great book. Very original with a great story and characters, can't wait for a sequel. Great author as well. Will buy another by the same author.
B004FHCH96|3.0|I bought this copy because after reading reviews I thought it would have the complicated dvd menu like the regular dvd has.  I was severely disappointed to see it didn't have that but instead a simple one.
1401324649|5.0|I sent this to my son in prison and he said that it was so funny!  I will have to put that on my \\"to read\\" list!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome on kindle fire I'm so used to playing on my iphone 4 but now I play on my kindle fire
0345522478|5.0|An inventive premise with rich characters.  If you are a dog lover, and have imagined the conversations you would have with your furry friend, buy this book for the character of Oberon alone.  He is my favorite character of any of the books I've read recently... witty, earthy and humorous with an underlying innocence.  Yet, don't mistake that innocence for weakness - he's one fierce hound. Read this, and enjoy!
0399160744|5.0|Love Slinkachu, he's photos always make me smile and think about whats happening now where they are taken.  Item Arrived in perfect confition.  Packaging was overly sufficient.  Thank you
B007GCY8FS|5.0|You will not be disappointed! I just started these books a couple of weeks ago. This was most excellent!  Highly recommended.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This is one of my most favorite shows on TV right now.  It is a fantastic show & being able to watch it on my PC (using the cloud storage) made the process very easy!
B0096PAA6E|4.0|All reviews are subjective and many reviewers try to confine and define the musicians effort. Not here. Gary does something on Blak and Blu that does not happen often these days.....displays his vast talent and versatility, whether you like it or not. He samples various genres of  music while flowing from one to the other almost effortlessly. Kudos to the production team for determining the arrangement and order of song choice. I heard much of what the other first reviewers speak of on the first listen.....but after not giving in to hear say and listening to Blak and Blu over and over, I find it to be infectious and a very good effort by a musician who refuses to be labeled. I hope you do too.
B005SZADQS|4.0|After watching the first episode of season 2 of \\"American Horror Story: Asylum\\" I had to go back and tear through the first season. While I have to say that so far season 2 is superior, nonetheless season 1 is still well worth watching. You can almost visualize the writing staff sitting around asking themselves what they love most about horror movies and then finding the best way to shock and horrify hardcore fans with the best that the genre has to offer. If some of the scenarios or forbidding music feel familiar, you're absolutely correct but these thefts feel more like an homage than a rip-off (music from \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" are used particularly well). The cast is just phenomenal in both seasons and I can't say enough positive things about the boldness of starting from scratch with a fresh story in season 2 while using largely the same troupe of actors. Jessica Lange just oozes talent in very scene while Zachary Quinto and the rest of the cast do a fine job all around. If you've ever enjoyed a good spooky story in the form of a novel, movie, or simply sitting in the dark at a slumber party as a kid, I urge you to watch this show.
0439023521|5.0|Loved it. Very entertaining kept me engaged and really a good unique story. Way better than the movie i finished in 1 week
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I'm a big Marvel Superhero comics fan. I think they are doing a great job translating these characters to the big screen. Thor is a simple, but well written and executed movie. The characters are faithful to the source material and the acting is excellent. I enjoyed it immensely.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I really enjoyed Bared to you and was really excited to get the 2nd story in the series.  I enjoyed the story and thought it was well written. (I must admit that I am a hopeless romantic).  So if you are looking for romance with a bit of heartbreak and ultimatley a happy ending I am sure it will not disapoint.  I am not sure what the third and final story will involve but I have pre ordered it on my kindle and am counting down the days....
B008A1TIOK|5.0|As a lover of both Vivaldi and Richter's music I was excited to give this a listen... half way through the tracks I'm in awe... Richter's style clearly present in one of classical's most monumental works... I love it!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I had heard so much about this series and so many people had good things to say about the book I had to read it.  I really enjoyed this book.  I could not put it down.  The story was so moving and sad aswell that I nearly cried in some parts.  I have read the series and was overcome by the emotion I felt for the characters.  I think this is a great read and that so many different people will enjoy it..
B00846REIS|5.0|The story line is similar to 50 Shades.  It was a good/easy read & now I just have to wait for the 3rd book to be released!
1451627297|1.0|I stopped reading Stephen King novels years ago and this book reminds me why...<br />This was basically a romance novel. The time travel premise we implausible from the first page, even for a Stephen King novel, and my first thought was if you change the future, it may get worse...<br />I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them and the book was heavy with Kings' extreme liberal bias.<br />Just skip it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fell in love with everyone. Not one to read but could not put the books down. Finally found my passion for ready.
1594744475|3.0|This book contains a lot of shaping, molding ideas for kids lunch box. When I received it, I was very exciting to make some cute lunch box for my 3-year-old, she loves this book by just reading as a picture book by the way.<br /><br />But when I read through it, I found out it is not practical for me.<br /><br />1. the writer use a lot of processed deli meat and processed cheese for decorating, which are something I'm trying so hard to avoid feed to my daughter, regard to the high sodium contains and other artificial ingredient.<br /><br />2. You have to by a lot of special tools to achieve the result. My kitchen is stuffed, no room for the punchers, stamps etc.<br /><br />3.In order to lay out as the book shows, the whole lunch box have to be neatly organized. If you left any spare space, those cute characters will fall apart during transporting. We use a thermo bento jar, which comes with 3 containers. It is not possible for a 3 year old to eat that much in a single lunch.<br /><br />4. My daughter is not a picky eater. She eats everything I offer as long as that is home cooked meal.  It might work on picky eater. But for me, just felt doesn't worth to spend time on shaping lunch box.<br /><br />over all, it is a cute book, but not practical for me.
0446672653|5.0|Only Love is Real addresses the topic of past lives and their relevance from the standpoint of a traditional psychotherapist.  As a distinguished M.D. and graduate of Columbia University and Yale Medical School, Dr. Brian Weiss was surprised and incredulous when under hypnosis one of his patients began recalling a trauma that had occurred several thousand years ago in a past life.  Amazingly, this trauma proved to hold the elusive solution to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks.  This seminal point in Dr. Weiss' career caused a turn down a professional path that included travels over thousands of years to discover the healing his patients needed.  Events in one's life, according to Weis, are shaped by lessons - learned and unlearned - from prior lives.  Only Love is Real examines patients' experiences from the standpoint of soulmates.  A soulmate is someone who incarnates in one's life to finish unfinished business or repay a karmic debt.<br /><br />The stories offered by Dr. Weiss in Only Love is Real provide insight into a field that is often fraught is confusion - the arena of love.  Why do people from completely differing backgrounds find each other and make a relationship work?  What is the attraction?  Only Love is Real offers a unique answer to questions that have baffled the world since time immemorial.  The stories are engaging, the concepts groundbreaking, and the lessons offered life-changing.
B009C5Z112|3.0|This album sadly left me unimpressed. After a much anticipated wait, I guess I was expecting something similar to Wintersun's first album with solos that blew my mind, riffs that still amaze me and drums that blasted all the way to the end. This album hardly delivers any of these elements. Instead, Time I is a mediocre attempt to create an epic second showing. In a few areas it feels and sounds like Jari was was striving too hard for a symphonic and grandiose sound. As long as we have waited for this album, I was hoping for something with a little more substance.<br /><br />My synopsis:<br />Is it worth a listen? Sure, as long as you are not expecting an album like Wintersun's first.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not. Especially since 2/5 of the album are instrumental intros/outros that I really don't care about.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I am using Yahoo Mail on my Kindle and it is pretty good. Easy to download and view attachments. The only issue I have is that it doesn't seem to refresh easily.
B004SBX112|2.0|The new Halloween update came out in the google play store today...not here.  Why does it take so long for updates on the kindle??  Whether it be Amazon's fault or Rovio's, I don't care.  I paid for the app with timely updates, I expected the app with timely updates... but I was clearly mistaken.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|Life is short...do not test Rick. Do not throw zombies at him. You want to see how the Living treat each other in a zombie world...check it out.<br /><br />If not...go watch the English Patient or some boring movie.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|What an amazing series of books.  They leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  It is extremely unfortunate that Steig Larsson passed away before the series was complete I would have enjoyed more books on Lisbeth & Mikael.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was quite thought provoking because it was told from the perspective of the main character, Alice, who had early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. The character is followed from the point of being quite lucid to having no memory at all. I loved it.
1449410243|5.0|I received this book as a birthday gift from a very dear friend. A very dear friend who knows this crazy cat lady in the making very well!<br /><br />This is a wonderful, colorful book of hilarious illustrations (they seem to be beyond cartoons) chock full of glimpses  into the elusive world of cats. Particularly cat brains and how they think.<br /><br />The topics range from 6 ways to tell if your cat thinks it's a mountain lion to how kittens are plotting to take over the world and each one is funnier than the last. One of my favorites is a \\"series\\" of illustrations called \\"The Bobcats\\" which takes you through the antics of two cats who work in an office. Each \\"episode\\" covers a different day of the week and it is hysterical.<br /><br />Along with the wonderful contents of this book, it is sturdy and will hold up well through many readings. Mine has made its way through the office and it still looks brand new.<br /><br />And the very best part of this book? The poster at the back of the book! This is a standard size poster that is nicely perforated that makes it easy to remove it from the book. Now you can have a reminder of the ways to tell if you are in your cat's cross-hairs to hang on your wall. This is a good refresher to keep on top of what your cats are thinking.<br /><br />This is an excellent gift for any cat lover, crazy or not! I have enjoyed it from the moment I received it. I can highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys humor and cats. Or even just humor. Pick it up today, you won't be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time! Yah maybe it is a little provocative and got your juices flowing but who cares, I know that my husband really enjoyed it if you know what I mean!!!! I can not wait to read the next one!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very fun game when listening to music  it brings back old memories  i only play a couple of games  it can become addictive
B008V59AFW|5.0|Anyone reading this review already knows this is one of Gabriel's best albums, so I won't be reviewing the music. What is outstanding is the remastering of the original album-definitely one of the best I've ever heard! Sonically, the music achieves an almost \\"wall of sound\\" affect that is especially impressive on a really good audio system. Instruments and vocals are much  more defined than in the previous Geffen cd release of this album. Kate Bush almost seems to be in the room as she duets with Gabriel on \\"Don't Give Up\\"! And \\"Red Rain\\" sounds as if its possibly been slightly re-mixed in that I heard some instrumentation that didn't standout in the earlier vinyl and digital releases. I could be wrong in regards to any remixing but it sure sounds great nonetheless! All this, plus you have 2 additional cds of a live concert in Athens Greece. Bottom line, if you're an admirer of Peter Gabriel and SO in particular, this is the version to buy. Again, I'm referring to the just released 25th Anniversary edition since most of the reviews here refer to an earlier cd version. Amazon needs to differentiate between these product reviews!
B008KGPEQG|3.0|A very talented writer - but I felt the story, as intriguing as it was, didn't  sustain itself in the length of  this book.

B000MAH5O2|5.0|Reading this book helped me to get to know and better understand our President. He is a man of great compassion.  He also has an exceptional understanding of history and the impact of the decisions made by the administrations both past and present.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is an inferior product.  The color (pink) began coming after after 1 hour of my phone being in it. The bottom part did not close all the way and the earbud plug at the top doesn't seem to seal properly either.  I did float the product like I was supposed to for an hour and it did not leak, but I was afraid to put my phone in it.  I have owned another Lifeproof, so I know how it is supposed to work.  I am not convinced that this is an authentic Lifeproof product.
B0091THRCU|3.0|I had a Sena sleeve for my iPhone 4/4S. When they didn't come out in time for the 5, I bought a Snugg. It's a bit too tight and has rubbed off my black anodization. It also has a bit of hard plastic on the front and back that I don't think is necessary. If they loosen the fit a bit, it might work. Until, then, wait for a Sena version.
0425263916|4.0|Having read Bared to You not that long ago I was somewhat sceptical of how this second one would read.  I was a big 50 Shades fan and while there are similarities, the writings of Sylvia Day are not the same.  I was pleasantly surpised by this 2nd book.  It had a much more developed plot line, less ridiculous adult situations and an ending that kept me reading. Congratulations on a good follow up. Looking forward to the next in the series.
B003L77G38|4.0|I enjoyed the show, so I bought the season's set.  Great to see FauxLivia and Walternate and the rest of the regulars.  The transfer from film to digital is excellent.  The sound is very good, and the menus are better than most blu-rays.<br /><br />Fringe fans, get it.
B002M7A79S|5.0|I had never watched \\"Firefly\\" during its one-and-only season on Fox.  It had never really been on my radar.<br /><br />It wasn't until I discovered it on Amazon Prime that I understood what so many passionate followers were talking about.  It was an excellent series, blending my favorite subject: science fiction with something I had never thought much of, the classic Western.  The blend is pure genius and I savored every episode of the series, just so that I could make it last.<br /><br />The culmination of all of this, \\"Serenity\\", took the original premise and brought layers of complexity to the story and to the whole ambience of the film, which benefitted greatly from the heightened level of special effects.<br /><br />It was hard to say goodbye to the crew of Serenity, but if I miss them, all I have to do is watch the series all over again.  Hell, I may have to break down and actually buy the movie, outright.
1402786360|5.0|This cook book is pretty awesome. It has recopies and tips not included on the website that are very artistic and delicious. I can't wait to explore the contents of this book more.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I bought my Kindle Fire when it first came out and found it difficult to locate a case. I like that it's purple and stands out. I dropped it on concrete yesterday, and the Kindle popped out of the case, but it wasn't broken, so I guess that's success.
B0086700CM|2.0|Find it frustrating to play on kindle fire. Game controls not very responsive. Seem to start over every time I die. Not easy to make progress in the game.<br />Got bored. Removed from device. Don't think I'll want to play that game on another device either.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I don't consider this series great literature, but good story telling. Interesting also that the movie Hunger Games followed the book so well. I suspect the movie sequal will combine the 2nd and 3rd books because the Mockingjay  was very internalized with less action.  Still a good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There are no problems that I have came across and it is not slow. Overall great:) I enjoy this app.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read. Kline does an amazing job painting a picture of the world he's created, both in the real world and the OASIS. From the moment the book starts until it ends it does an amazing job at keeping you sucked in and involved. I'll be eagerly awaiting his next book!
6305949980|5.0|This movie is magic. Love Halloween and do not want Gore and violence. This is good clean fun and a Tim Burton masterpiece.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless was not what I expected. I've read several other military hero stories and most of them started the book at the beginning of their military career or basic training. As I got deeper into the first several chapters, I wondered if I purchased the wrong book. How could anyone have a drug problem and not only become a SEAL, but excel at it and ultimately become an amazing person and a true hero? As I listened (I bought the audio) to the story unfold, I actually began to dislike Adam for what he was putting his family through and for throwing away his life, all in the name of drugs. He started out to be such a strong and wonderful boy. At first I wished he had never met his 'girlfriend'--the one who began his downward spiral into the drug world, but I had to ask myself--would he have become the man he had become without that experience? Did that reconfirm his beliefs and his honesty and self sacrifice? He ended up with an outstanding SEAL career, even after so many injuries and issues that were thrown his way.<br /><br />Three quarters of the way into the book, I was literally in tears as I was driving. Even though I knew what was coming, it just broke my heart to hear about the courage and selflessness that led to his death, and, of course, to hear about his family's reaction and devastation. Having a young son in the military who has just returned from Afghanistan, this hit me very hard. All I can say is thank you, not only to Adam, but to his family, for the sacrifice they have made. Adam sounded like an amazing and spiritual person who always wanted and tried to do the right thing. His story should be told in every drug rehab facility--required reading in fact! This book will have you laughing, cheering, and crying. If you are not religious, some of the book may put you off. For me, it just reaffirmed my beliefs, especially hearing about the amazing things that occurred after his death. Rest in peace, Adam, and thank you for not only your service and sacrifice, but for wanting your story to be told--all of it--no matter the shame it may bring you. Your shame was removed by your amazing SEAL career and the person you became because of it.
034580404X|5.0|I had no idea what the series was about. I had just finished \\"Hunger Games\\" and noticed this was on best list.<br />It was suspenseful through all 3 books. I hated to put them down. Characters were developed along with story progression.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|whenever there's a new update it always deletes my progress its getting really annoying but the levels are  really fun .
B00005JLYW|5.0|Have watched both Charlie's angels movies, I would say non stop excitement and tons of action keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's great if you can watch both movies back to back.
B004SBX112|4.0|I'm hooked on the Angry Birds games (I have all 4 &amp; waiting for the new one). I'm just not happy with the slowness of the updates for the Kindle Fire. I'm currently waiting for the Halloween update... please hurry up and bring it. Thank you.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely devoured this book!  I read it so quickly that I had to go back and re-read to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time around.  Both times it did not disappoint!!  I read it with anticipation...definitely a page turner!  At times I was so mad at Gideon, but then it all made sense in the end...  What a great ending and cliffhanger for book #3!  Amazing love story.  The passion between the two main characters is amazing and as a secondary character, I love Cary too!  Dying to read book #3 and praying for a book #4!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a great cast!  An excellent view of real life and emotional range of human realities.  Each time I view the film I get another life lesson. What a fun adventure!!!

0449807819|5.0|Salman Rushdie is a brave man and critcally acclaimed author of several notable novels and short stories. Rushie's novel \\"Midnight's Children\\" has been awarded the Best of the Booker Award books. He appears regularly on various talk shows and is a sage wit and intellectual.<br />  Joseph Anton is the long memoir of the years Rushdie lived under threat of being murdered by the Ayatollah Khomeni and the Iranian government. He was accused of having insulted Allah in his novel \\"The Satanic Verses.\\" This threat against him began on February 14, 1989 when he was informed by the BBC that his life was in danger. Rushdie went into hiding. He took the pseudonymn \\"Joseph Anton\\" (based on his admiration of two of his favorite authors: Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov). Rushdie would learn all too well what it is like to experience a heart of darkness experience of being the victim of a manhunt launched by fundamentalistic Islamic fanatics.<br />  Salman Rushdie was born to a Muslim family in Bombay in 1947 (the year of India and Pakistan's formation and independence from Great Britain). Rushdie came to England at the age of 13. The author graduated from Cambridge with a history degree. He spent several years in advertising while he sought to establish a career as a novelist. Rushide has two children and has been married four times. In Joseph Anton we learn about the difficulties experienced in his marriages and trying to raise children in a very difficult situation. The British government did a good job of protecting the famous writer. Rushdie was aided by several friends who gave him lodgings in which to hide from his enemies. Among Rushdie's friends are famous stars in the political and literary constellations of England, the United States and among many third world authors. His list of friends includes the late Christopher Hitchens; Lady Antonia Fraser, the later Harold Pinter, M. Bragg the BBC commentator, Kinglsey and Martin Amis, the late Graham Greene and many politicians including President Bill Clinton and newsman Mike Wallace.<br />  During the time of the fatwa threat Rushdie continued to write books; give lectures and pen articles defending freedom of expression for artist. He is a brave man whose memoir is well worth reading in our age of international terrorism. This is a fascinating and important memoir which deserves a wide readership. Highly recommended!including President Bill Clinton and newsman Mike Wallace.<br />  During the time of the fatwa threat Rushdie continued to write books; give lectures and pen articles defending freedom of expression for artist.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Awesome book.  I was so excited when it got delivered to my Kindle.  Then when I actually had some time to read it I couldn't put it down.  Loved the story line.  Looking forward to then next one.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|\\"ANOTHER Cinderella adaptation?\\" moaned my brain as I started in on \\"Cinder\\". \\"Haven't we done this already?\\"<br /><br />Yes, brain, yes we have. But we've never read anything quite like this. The sci-fi future created in \\"Cinder\\" is a little gritty, a little wondrous, and real enough that you can apply what you read to the world you live in.<br /><br />While I did have some questions at the end (such as WHY are cyborgs regarded as second class citizens or things when it seems to just be technologically advanced prosthetics for most?) I wasn't overly concerned with them since the prejudice as written felt real.<br /><br />The story of \\"Cinder\\" would not have been well-handled by most others. Where some would be encouraged to shove the Cinderella parallels down our throats, Meyer is content to give us a sassy little wink instead. The result is that the story stands as on its own without the Cinderella fairy tale carrying it along.<br /><br />In the hands of a less adept storyteller, \\"Cinder\\" would be a mess. With so much world lore to convey and *so* many twists, the story could have ended up a steaming heap of confusion. But Meyer never let's the story out of her control, and the result is a wonderful first novel for the series.<br /><br />However, -2 points for the annoying cliffhanger.
B007AFBYYY|4.0|I saw this movie on YouTube, its has a wonderful Soundtrack that is muffled on this version. I wouldn't have even known what I was missing had not I had watched the YouTube version 4-5 times over. The movie itself is the same which what I wanted but its the cherry on top ( Soundtrack ) that its short. If anyone know which version or where to get the better version can you post, I will buy again just to get that.
B0038AUY96|5.0|Jo Nesbo's book Snowman is excellently written. A gripping read from start to finish. Interesting character development, some good twists and turns. A good example of high quality crime writing which the Scandinavian countries seem to do so well.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is a very diverse cd, genre wise.  The opening song (State of Grace) is my favorite, and I agree with other reviews that is has a bit of 1980's U2 flavor (in a good way).  Others are slower country ballads, and several are teen girl pop type songs that most of our daughters will absolutely love (and I tap my toe to).  All sound great,and least 7 or 8 songs will be big hits.  I think this is the best album musically she has created to date.  I however have very diverse musical tastes.  If someone is looking for pure country, look elsewhere.  I hope Taylor doesn't take the \\"mediocre\\" reviews too much to heart, but the bottom line is this will be a HUGE comercial success.  I hope she comes to the Detroit area soon.
B004SBX112|4.0|Why does it take many months for paid versions to get the latest update?<br />I don't want to play free version with annoying ads!
B001OSIV62|5.0|Those french are so dramatic. It was a good story, but in the end, he walked across a wire, you know? It's not like he cured cancer or anything. No real struggle to achieve it. And what was up with that guard who just let them go by?
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is the album of the year! Macklemore is legit!  This is the only rapper whose lyrics mean anything.  Buy it.
0316228532|2.0|Simply put, the book did not get my attention, did not keep my interest even after 100 pages into the story and I was unable to finish it. Deleted it from my list.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|To best describe this book I'd say it's a cross between Back to the Future and Groundhog Day and with an interesting historic plot.  Many books have been written about the Kennedy assassination but they've all been written from a third person perspective (how else could they be written).  King has done something that I don't believe has been done before in that he's inserted a character that didn't exist in history to watch and monitor the events as they unfolded with the knowledge of what happens next in an effort to intentionally change the future.  As a historic treatise, it's a fascinating review but the addition of numerous sub-plots makes an exceptional read.  At 850 pages, it's not a quick read but it's so well written and the characters are so well developed that it's hard to put down.  I highly recommend this book.
034580404X|5.0|These books are amazing and I recommend that everyone reads them. They are so romantic and give you a different look on life.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Bought two of these. I placed one by the front door, and the other by a stairway. Both work great. Don't have to worry about finding the light switch or having to worry about forgetting to close the lights. Will buy more after I find out how long the 4 AA batteries last.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What can I say I am seriously captivated and HOOKED by this book.... must have read it more times than I'd like to admit. Awesome characters, made my heart cry while I read. Definitely a good book.... so happy to know that another one will be released..... cant wait!!!!

B00984668E|5.0|The Sword comes back with a new album just 5 months after the Hammer of Heaven single from May of 2012, and 2 years 2 months after Warp Riders was released in August of 2010.  This is pretty cool for rock fans, because many bands these days are taking longer to record records.  The Sword has stuck to their brand of stoner type metal that tips its hat to the 70s artists that have influenced so many bands.  However, there is a flair that this Texas quartet has setting them apart.  Maybe it's the straight ahead approach that lacks the slow tempo love songs or trippy jams that often cause many albums to feel out of balance.  This album rocks beginning to end just like Warp Riders, Gods of the Earth and Age of Winters did before.<br /><br />Dual guitars rip back and forth across each other and beginning to end.  The bass thunders to fill out the bottom end and links perfectly with the drums, which drive right through stone.  Ten tracks of new material, 4 live bonus songs of previous material and a ZZ Top cover blend together to give fans a wonderful ride across the multiverse!  For the money, this album is worth every penny!  I love the artwork The Sword comes up with for their albums, and the lyrics always call to a far off land where warriors wage battle against ancient creatures.  I always seem to get lost in listening to The Sword, and I can only find myself again when the music ends.<br /><br />Apocryphon, the title track, jumps out as the strongest track to me.  The quirky keyboard intro that also weaves through the song conjures up classic rock memories like The Who's Baba O'Riley.  The live tracks prove the band is no slouch when it comes to live performance.  Seeing them live will be a goal of mine in the nearest of futures.  The covering ZZ Top (Cheap Sunglasses) does seem to be popular lately.  Mastodon being one of the recent bands to do the same (Just Got Paid).  The Sword seems to capture the feeling of the song a bit more true to ZZ Top.  Nicely done.  Well played.  The Sword has really put forth a solid album for metal fans to rejoice and crank up!l played.  The Sword has really put forth a solid album for metal fans to rejoice and crank up!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family has just fallen in love with the Piano Guys. This is the first CD by them that we have ever purchased.<br />We love the complexity and intricacy of each of the pieces on the CD. The net lease are all especially brilliant. The way they weave familiar melodies in n out of each other is like a musical kaleidoscope of sound and rhythm... pure delight.<br />I am ordering more of their CDs.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it multiple times every single day. I love the many features and options. And the price is definitely right too!

B000W1YYSQ|4.0|Rush's 2112 begins with something that almost no one would expect: a twenty minute title track. This song seems to be the main focus of the album, making the tracks following it feel less accessible.<br /><br />2112: The title track clocks in at 20:33, longer than all of the following tracks combined. It opens spectacularly, with a great theme that lasts through the seven minute mark. This is the best and most creative part of the song, with fantastic melodies interlaced throughout. Each member shines in this segment. Then, however, the song slows, and you hear what sounds like Alex Lifeson tuning his guitar, setting up for the worst part of the entire album. Those new to Rush will find Geddy Lee's vocals here to be a great turnoff. At about thirteen minutes in, they reprise the first part of the song, with Lifeson laying down one of the tastiest solos you will ever hear. The last seven minutes are an interesting display of musicianship, reprising many musical themes heard earlier, finally leading into to a great and dramatic close to 2112.<br /><br />What is left of the album almost seems like an afterthought, however, there are some very noticeable standouts. Lifeson's smooth playing on A Passage to Bangkok is great, despite a mediocre chorus. The Twilight's slower and more minor melodies have a great mood and make for a good song. Neither Lessons or Tears do much for me, they seemingly forgettable. However, the last song, Something for Nothing, is perhaps the strongest song on the entire album. Geddy Lee's vocals here shine, with arrangement and instrumentation being very well thought out. One can feel that the band had it together on this song. I just wish they had written like this for the rest of the album.<br /><br />Conclusion: Though there are some missteps, this is a solid album, with the great moments outshining the bad. My favorites from the album are Something for Nothing and, of course, 2112.
B003JZT2AW|5.0|Great compilation of hits.  I got this new on amazon for 4.00 bucks! yes.  A must for oasis fans if you want one last chance at getting their music in one collection.
B0018J48QO|5.0|This opening episode of Dexter has left me breathless.  How will he meld these two worlds? And the ending of It's Alive has left me eager to see what's next.  If you enjoy character studies, and can tolerate some \\"heebie-jeebie\\" scenes because they're a necessary component to that character study, you will fall in love with this series.  It's right up there with Lie To Me, and Bones.
1476712042|5.0|At first I was a bit skeptical given the age of the main characters (late teens/early twenties). However, once i started reading I couldn't put the book down. The chemistry between the two is amazing and leaves you on edge. I have to admit its a well written story pictured out of real life. No cheesy romance with fake \\"I love you\\" after one kiss.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />Abby \\"Piegon\\" and Travis start out being friends. Travis is the 'bad boy' and Abby is the good girl. (Or so you think-she has a history) Travis is quite the man whore and is overwhelmed with the blown off attention he receives from Abby. Needless to say Travis falls hard and Abby is at first completely clueless. Ahh but things change and Abby starts to see the whole picture. One things leads to another...but Abby's history catches up with her which creates some serious issues and emotional turns.<br /><br />Loved it! And can't wait to read Travis's side of the story....

1611761565|4.0|I purchased the audio CD version of this book.  I have to say, although it's not quite as gripping as I imagined, it's still a very good novel.  The context of it in itself is enlightening about the little known lives of special ops service men.  The audio version is very well read, no overdone attempts at voicing characters.  I highly recommend the book, including the audio version, and truly appreciate the author giving us some insight into their lives.<br />As a footnote, I found nothing in the novel that seemed compromising to national security or the integrity of the Seals.
B009UQCD0K|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers that this is some of the best-written T.V. drama in a long time. When I have a hard time predicting what will happen and who will survive, I know it's good! I like that Rick takes care of the leader of the inmates, because that's what he would realistically do at this point: a lot of shows would have kept the guy around a long time to milk the conflict. I like that Sophia was finally found turned last season, because that's what was most likely to happen: no happy, implausible reunions. I'm glad Hershel survives this episode because I think he's a great foil for the other male characters, as was Dale (R.I.P.). I'm also intrigued to find out what Andrea and the bad-ass lady she's hooked up with are doing. But . . . one of the rules of fantasy/sci-fi/horror is that even if the world created is riddled with outlandish magic, there has to be a consistency as to how and why things work the way they do. This show is more in the sci-fi horror genre, but still, the dead coming back to life is a pretty mysterious premise. Whether pseudo-scientific or fantastical (I think the former would be more in line with the show) I would like some explanation for: 1. Why, as another viewer pointed out, these zombie folks are so strong if they are rotting--in particular, how can they bite so hard and tear flesh with their teeth and jaws?; 2. How did they discover that cutting off a bitten limb would keep the bitten person from turning? Andrea's sister was bitten in the arm, I think, and no one tried saving her by cutting off her arm?? Perhaps we'll find out. Even if not, I will doubtless keep watching as long as the story-telling remains strong. Re. the baby, I think it would be a nice (temporary) reprieve if s/he were normal, or even if Laurie got bitten and pregnancy turned out to offer some immunity to the virus (or whatever). Just a shard of light now and then would help make all the darkness more endurable through this season and beyond.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much. My favorite part is when they come out with the chariot and are on fire. The main character is Katniss. I loved this book and you will too!I hope you get this.

1589949811|4.0|In this box you get the core set which contains 3 quests and enough cards to build roughly 2 decks if you are not picky about which cards each one gets. If you are a single player, your options are much better but you will still be limited.<br /><br />The 3 quests come in different difficulties, easy, medium, and Bullshit. The later is doable solo with the core set, slightly easier with 2 people, but also leads into my next point. This game is fun, and I love it, but you really want to get some expansions for it to reach its full potential. The harder quests get easier with the different cards, and with the core set the actual deck building aspect does not get much love. You usually want to make a 50 card 2 sphere deck, and they give you a 60 card pool to do that with. Not much variety there, however with the 6 or so expansion packs for the core set. Then the big box sets and expansions for those give you even more.<br /><br />This game is a addiction, I have bought hundreds of cards after this. Then you need sleeves for them...and dividers...and a custom box inlay. Then you are building decks for different quests, and keeping written lists of the cards for each one in the boxes. It turns into a full on hobby and not just a random game you play from time to time.<br /><br />The card art is good, and the different card effects are varied. The rules are easy enough, but you will want the book on hand for the first few games. I read the rules once, tried to play and reference it a lot my first few turns. Once you figure it out though, the game flows nicely. And I love that it works well for a solo game. Sometimes you want to play and nobody is around, hell it happens a lot it seems.<br /><br />There is also a computer version of this you can grab for free, you could always check that out first and see if the game is something you are into before buying.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved it! Would recommend it to anyone wanting to read an unusual thriller, written in a unique and engaging style.

0671004107|4.0|Few people have expressed just how insignificant the earth appears amid the backdrop of the entire universe more eloquently than Carl Sagan.  He spent a lifetime impressing us with how well he conveyed the grand scale of the cosmos, and in Contact Sagan has brought that same style and vision to fiction.<br /><br />The story develops around the intriguing idea of a message received from another star system.  Contact deals with questions of space, time, faith, religion, and the essence of the universe as a whole.  Sagan's incredible mind and imagination give this story all the intrigue that is needed.  Thus even without creating characters with significant depth that so often describes good fiction this story maintains its quality purely for its engrossing ideas.<br /><br />Sagan deals directly with some of our grandest questions, and instead of simply providing answers he has widened the horizon of potential answers.  Many ideas are proposed that reach beyond what most would normally ponder.  Sagan is a master of spatial awareness and imagery and in this story he has examined the realm of possibilities in a manner few are capable of accomplishing.  The conclusion of this story is so well done that it will be pleasing to views of any persuasion.  The book is far superior to the movie adaption and I'd recommend Contact to any fan of science fiction.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Great action packed movie that lived up to the hype.  It would be good on a big screen TV with surround sound.  I watched it on my Kindle on the plane.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I purchased several other Kindle books; however, the information I received was thin.  But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the information found in \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\" was well thought out. There is absolutely no fluff.  The formatting tips were priceless.  There is information for people who use OpenOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word.  In addition, I was interested in reading everything I could get my hands on when it comes to the front matter of your book.  I must say again the author did not disappoint.  It was all very clear and easy to follow with simple to understand examples.  I would highly recommend this book.  It shortened my learning curve tremendously!

B0068FZ07Y|5.0|I was stationed about 15 miles from Petaluma where American Graffiti was filmed. We would make a donut run every morning. I didn't witness the filming. The movie was made after I was reassigned. It was more or less about rich kids from the 50's, but it was still entertaining.
1451662432|4.0|*****Spoilers Ahead*****<br /><br />My Background<br /><br />I want to begin by saying that, growing up, I never was that big a fan of Arnold  Schwarzenegger (or any of the other 1980s action stars...Stallone, Willis, etc...for that matter). I just never cared too much for their movies, as it seemed that nothing could harm their on-screen, larger-than-life personas.<br /><br />Heck, even Batman (of all people!) got the hell beat out of him by Bane at the box office this summer! And, Batman's character and on-screen persona are much (much!) more believable to me than any of the aforementioned gentlemen's roles.<br /><br />However, with age, all of these guys (see the two \\"Expendables\\" movies) now seem (at least at times) cool, even very cool, to me; I even enjoy viewing their (1980s) movies! So, upon hearing about Arnold Schwarzenegger's impending auto-biography for the first time: I was hesitant (will go into detail about my \\"hesitation\\" later on in this review), but definitely wanted to read it. And, now that I have, I would like to share my thoughts on it with you.<br /><br />\\"Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story\\"<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger's auto-biography begins with his childhood growing up in Austria. \\"AS\\" was born in 1947 (I cannot believe he is now 65 years old!). His father was the police chief (four man police staff) of a tiny, rural village; his mother a stay-at-home housewife. AS lived with them and his older brother, Meinhard. Arnold's home was rustic, but comfortable--excepting the fact they had no plumbing--and he relates an amusing ancedote about one of his favorite childhood games was playing Church with his brother. He also liked Art (makes sense) very much in school.<br /><br />AS had a primarily happy childhood, with the one exception being that his father would come home on Friday nights drunk, and raging mad. He would scream and bang furniture around--but did not become physically violent--and would usually make things up to hisfamily the following day. He would use physical punishment (spanking) on his children, but that was the thing to do in those days.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that, according to AS, all of the men in his home village would act like that. World War II may have been over, but they were still feeling the effects of losing the war. They felt like losers--and really could not discuss it because all elements of the Third Reich, and the Nazi Party in general, were being systematically erased by the government. Furthermore, AS's father had apparently been a member of the Nazi Party, but by all accounts had nothing to do--or even knowledge of--their atrocities. However, this would come back to haunt AS a bit when, as a \\"big-time\\" actor, a Rupert Murdoch publication would allege that he, himself was a (neo) Nazi Party member.<br /><br />Bodybuilding and Mr. Olympia Titles<br /><br />I am not going to go into too much detail here as this subject just doesn't interest me. Arnold talks about his (extremely difficult) training to get his body into the \\"Mr. Olympia\\" shape. The part here that was interesting to me is that, while still in his youth, he knew he wanted to get out of Austria and come to America. In particular, he wanted to come to Los Angeles, and become famous. This is why at age 15 he began his strict bodybuilding regimen. Oh yeah, one more thing: he says he knew it would be easy to get lots of girls if he got his body into terrific shape. Obviously, his plans worked out: he won the title of Mr. Olympia a record seven times...and we all know about his acting and political career.<br /><br />*There are also contained in the section a few ancedotal notes about bodybuilder (and future actor) Lou Ferrigno, which (as a fan of Ferrigno's-\\"The Incredible Hulk\\") I (much) enjoyed reading.<br /><br />Acting Career<br /><br />As you may have guessed, I particularly enjoyed this part of his auto-biography. AS relates that he had a specific plan in mind: he wanted to establish himself--if he could--with a heroic, on-screen persona...and would refuse lucrative but mindless, \\"muscle-bound\\" roles that diverged from his plan. He actually almost passed on his iconic role as \\"The Terminator\\" (!) because he only wanted to play heroic characters.<br /><br />The \\"Hollywood\\" section of Arnold's book also gives us a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes workings of how movies (deal-makings) are made. The deal-making stories related here are quite interesting, and read (very) fast. One story that stands out to me in particular is when AS relates his first-ever meeting with famed producer Dino de Laurentiis. Apparently, AS, on entering de Laurentiis' office, made a smart-alecy remark about the producer's height...ending their meeting before it even began!<br /><br />Yes, the two men did make up.<br /><br />Arnold also goes into great detail about the production of several of his (hit) movies: \\"The Terminator\\", the \\"Conan\\" franchise, and \\"Total Recall\\"--to name a few. Unfortunately, he doesn't give some of his lessor movies as much detailed (page-wise) attention. I wish he would have devoted a little more time to the making of...let's say,  The Sixth Day, for example.<br /><br />Family Life<br /><br />This section (and all throughout his book, actually) AS discusses meeting Maria Schriver, their courtship, and family. It is interesting to note that AS has a great relationship with Maria's (The Kennedy's) family, despite their being at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Arnold does mention, however, that, when he was running for Governor of California, Ted Kennedy--though the two men were close, family-wise--refused to endorse him due to their political differences.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most talked about parts of this book is the affair Arnold had with actress Brigette Nielsen--during his courtship (at the same time) with Maria Schriver. AS relates that they were filming a movie together and once that (the movie's filming) was over, Nielsen wanted to continue their relationship but AS told her no, he loved Maria, and was going to marry her.<br /><br />I will say, to Arnold Schwarzenegger's credit, he didn't go into salacious details about this affair--or any others, for that matter...even the ones in his pre-marriage/courtship days.<br /><br />Politics/The Governator (Hey, it is the name of one of his chapters!)<br /><br />Honestly, this, as with the bodybuilding section, was not one of my favorite parts of Arnold's book, either. Maybe it is because I differ with him quite a bit politically--I don't know--I just didn't get into this part of his book as much as I thought I would. But, it still makes for a mostly decent read.  If you are interested in how he came to his decision to run for Governor of California--this part of AS's bio is for you. And, you will get the behind-the-scenes ancedotal notes that led up to his announcing his intentions of running (to replace recalled Governor, Gray Davis) in 2003--on The Tonight Show.<br /><br />How (among other things):<br /><br />*Maria at first did not want him to run...and how she subsequently changed her mind and became his most enthusiastic supporter.<br /><br />*What the Kennedy family felt about his decision.<br /><br />*What his children felt about their father running for governor.<br /><br />*Heck, we even get an amusing ancedote that relates how Jay Leno was backstage at The Tonight Show, moments before Arnold's announcement, trying to get the \\"will he or won't he\\" info out of him. Arnold wouldn't tell him.<br /><br />One other interesting (ancedotal) note of Arnold's governorship is his relating how he--as Governor--told a California state legislator (and harshly critical political opponent) publicly to go \\"F*** himself.\\" It seems AS, when vetoing his opponent's bill, wrote a letter (the picture of said letter is in his book) of reply that began each new line with: F, *, *, K...<br /><br />...well, you (and so did the letter's recipient) getthe point.<br /><br />The Final Chapters of Arnold's book go into detail about \\"Arnold's Rules\\" (how to get the most out of life) and the affair (and out-of-wedlock child)  that ended his 25 year marriage to Maria Schriver.<br /><br />I'll discuss his affair (\\"The Secret\\") in my closing thoughts. As for \\"Arnold's Rules,\\" he certainly seems to be an extremely hard-working, driven individual (as is the case with most successful people).  Among AS's advice he says we should always turn our \\"liabilities into assets.\\" In Arnold's case, he relates that, when starting out in Hollywood, people would look at his muscles, and hear his accent and assume he was dumb. He wouldn't let this faze himself, however, he would just work that much harder and let them go right on thinking this (easing up) and in turn, their easing up would make it easier for him to get where he wanted to be.<br /><br />AS also advises us to (1) always take \\"No\\" as a \\"Yes.\\" Don't be defeated, but rather, be motivated instead to achieve what it is you want to accomplish; (2) Use outrageous humor to settle a score (remember the veto rejection letter?); And, amongst many other pieces of advice, (3) Use all 24 hours in the day to your advantage--this really stood out to me. AS relates how he gave a talk at a University and a student told him he didn't have enough time in the day to accomplish his goals. AS replied this was nonsense and related how (when he was the student's age) he:<br /><br />*trained for Mr. Olympia five hours a day<br />*went to acting classes four hours a day<br />*worked in construction for several hours<br />*and went to college and did his homework and studying, to boot.<br /><br />In other words, when we aren't home, in bed, asleep, we should use all of our (waking) time productively--we can rest, Arnold states, when we are in the grave.<br /><br />As I said, this really stood out to me and made me think about new ways to manage my time more effectively.<br /><br />So, Finally<br /><br />I (as earlier stated) was very hesitant to purchase this book. Coming on the heels of the scandal that ended his 25 year marriage, I initially thought this book's publication date was at best, poorly timed. At worst, capitalizing on a terrible scandal. Perhaps I was (and am) rationalizing, but checking out (prior to purchase) some of the online reviews of this book, it does appear to me that this was a planned (much in advance) work that had nothing at all whatsoever to do with (the timing of) his affair becoming public knowledge. The chapter, \\"The Secret,\\" seems to be a hastily added, last minute insertion that (besides backing up and \\"confirming\\" my view) really does not go into that much detail about his mistress/affair...and, truthfully, I do not want to discuss it that much, myself. I'll leave that part of the book for you to read.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is apparently planning to get back into the movies full-time. He discusses several movies of his that have been green lit, one of which is called \\"Triplets\\"-and is set to be a sequel to \\"Twins\\" and will co-star Danny Devito and Eddie Murphy. Of course, Arnold was already back on the big screen this summer in \\"Expendables 2\\". I must admit I loved the scene where he \\"forgets his own strength\\" and rips the door off of the smart car.<br /><br />So...apparently all things old are new again. Arnold says he hopes that, going forward, he and Maria can work things out. I'm certainly not defending Arnold's actions in any way, but I hope they can, too.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.
B0000024SI|5.0|Review no. 345. Originally released in 1965. This is probably - like the fourth Bob Dylan title I've ever purchased for my ever-updating music collection. I admit I'm not the biggest Dylan fan, not even close. But I do love certain songs by the veteran song-writing troubadour. Oddly enough several of my Dylan favorites are on this nine song CD - like for example \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", the compelling \\"Tombstone Blues\\", the true gem \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\", the title track \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and the awesome \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\". It's 100% pure Dylan. Highly recommended.

0099557363|5.0|Set against the background of the messy French departure from Algeria, this story must have been so believable when it was first published.  It still holds up today, and Forsyth's almost fanatical attention to detail remains fresh and relevant to this day.  One to go back to again and again.

B000T433CO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in years!!!  EVERY woman should see it.  Its really a great chic flick.  The scenery, the English Countryside.  And the story were just perfect.  A true love story.  Kate Winslet was perfect and I fell in love with both her and Cameron Diaz's acting.  Cameron was dazzling in it.  And boy that Jude Law!  What can I say.  WOW!  What a hunk.  A movie you can watch over and over.  Just make sure you have a box of tissues by you.

B006OITIQE|3.0|I'm a 40 yr old man and sometimes I really dig teeny-bopper music.  The first track \\"What makes you beautiful\\" is, of course, an excellent toe-tappin' diddy.  It rips off some famous riff of another song.  But I don't care, I probably like that song too.  I thank the Olympics for show-casing the song for me -- though young dude hair has become a ridiculous thing these days.  Fortunately I bought only the music album and I don't have to look at the singers.  (Amazon's player makes a postage stamp of the album cover at the bottom, but a slight re-arrangement of my desk and I can cover it up!)<br /><br />None of the other songs have caught my ear, but they don't make me squirm either.  I assume after a bunch of hears in a couple of months I'll end up liking at least a couple off the rest of the album.  (I play about 20 albums on random shuffle in my office for weeks -- after which my ears pick out a semi-random assortment of songs that I'll really like.)<br /><br />Right this second I'm listening to \\"Save You Tonight\\" and though not as original as the \\"...Beautiful\\" track, it is kinda dancey and pleasant.  Its one of those songs I'll change my music to, when one of the neuvo-metal-heads comes into my office to talk to me about work.  I love watching them squirm in their arrogant, pseudo-counter-culture refinement.<br /><br />I recommend this album at $5.

B002S0KB4K|5.0|The master of the espionage thriller has moved seamlessly into the world of post-9/11 political paranoia.

It is simply riveting.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Loved,loved this book. An aging centenarian's befuddled mind creates havoc... but not nearly the havoc he created as a younger man.  Poor Allen, all he wanted to do was get away from the planned celebration  of his 100th birthday. The Mayor is ready with balloons and the dreadful head nurse is sure he is hiding with yet another purloined bottle of vodka just to vex her.  With back flashes to his early life shedding light on his decisions in today's world  the pace is fast and furious. Warning: Laughter is non stop. Oh, and watch out for the elephant who sits on command!

B008TRUDAS|4.0|I have to say that I almost stopped reading this book when Will took Lake to a club for Slamming. Poetry reading? No thank you! But after contemplating for about an hour I decided to give the book a try and I'm happy that I did.<br /><br />Lake has lost her father to a heart attack and will lose more than she ever thought. Things are hard for her and moving away from the only home she's ever known doesn't help either. Will, a new neighbor, becomes one of her reasons why she loves Michigan. About a week later he's the biggest reason why she hates Michigan.<br /><br />This new potential relationship took an ugly turn Lake's first day of school. Will cant be her..... OMG he is! Time to change classes ASP! Who would have ever thought a guy that young would be a teacher!<br /><br />After the death of his parents Will had to grow up and fast. Not only for his sanity but for his little brother.<br /><br />So much is at stake but someone else's lips on Lake was the last straw. Will knew he couldn't stay away and even though he had good intentions he cant and wont lose her. She brought life back into him and he doesn't want to let her go even at the price of his livelihood.<br /><br />Lake is still very young but she soon finds out that she has to make grown up decisions because before long nothing will ever be the same.<br /><br />They may be young but the loss between Lake and Will brings out the responsible adults that most people don't see until way later in life.<br /><br />This was a great read and I'm so glad I didn't keep this down.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Fun for adults, too hard for kids- different than normal birds because of the \\"no gravity in space\\" concept.  TOO MANY POP UP ADS!  Annoying and the kids get frustrated... it' s confusing on how to close the ad and get back to the game.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Was okay, nothing like Lost City. Keeps wanting me to select buttons that are not visible on my device.  Not  to the point of having to pay real money, but still find game repetitive and dull.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|First I want to address all the people complaining the film is nothing like the book. This may be the case but seeing as how the film's screenplay was written by the author of the book, Seth Grahame-Smith. As a matter of fact he is featured throughout the special features and has the only commentary on the movie. So fans of the book that are upset with the film can go take it up with the author who changed everything.<br /><br />Now that I've said that let me get on to the movie. It was a lot of fun. We so often get watered down, PG-13 bloodless horro flicks. Here we get a full on R rated, violent vampire action flick in the same tone as Blade, but as a period piece. And I must say Benjamin Walker swings a mean axe! I really enjoyed the cast, including Anthony Mackie and Rufus Sewel. The action is visceral and filmed in a way where it's not all about the crazy editing though that's there. I never expected a hsitory lesson from this but I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.<br /><br />Also as a quick note, on Blu-Ray there is a motion comic called the Encounter that is awesome. it's the story of Elizabeth Batheroy as told by one Edgar Allen Poe to his good friend Abe Lincoln.<br /><br />If you like action movies, or vampires, or all of the above you should enjoy this flick. If you're into alrenate history and such, you should check this out.<br /><br />I kinda wish they had left the ending from the book though.
0316223239|2.0|I just finished Room by Emma Donoghue. Although it only took me one day to read, I find myself neither moved or disgusted, and I was expecting at least one of these reactions in accordance with the ghastly plot the back cover so encourages.<br /><br />Written in the voice of  the main character, Jack, a five year old boy conceived via the rape of his young mother, I expected a rudimentarily sounding grisly tale of the worst experiences one could expect to endure from being held captive by a sinister madman. However, what I found was a book written nearly void of emotion.  While reading, I felt no anxiety, fear, or sorrow, all emotions I would expect to feel from a plot such as this one.  Combined with the emotionless writing, there were no twists or turns, or any scenes that kept me riveted. With the exception of one small climax that was so boringly played out, this book held true and steady  on a slow ride to the end.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the plot has a good foundation for a fast paced, monumental thriller, however, I find it merely acceptable.  Since this is my first time Ms. Donoghue, I will give her another go, but I'm sorry to say I just wouldn't recommend this book due to the lack of emotion and gripping details that could make this book a winner.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book talks about every aspect of building muscle and not just the lifting part.  It covers nutrition, how you should eat, what you should eat, and when you should eat and the science behind why.  It references several studies in regards to nutrition and lifting, talks about what supplements work and which ones don't.  Finally the book is written for those looking to build a lot of muscle, with that said though it has so much other good information it is worth reading even if you don't want to be a body builder.  The book is super easy to read, and hard to put down because it has so much good information.

0413735907|1.0|A Clockwork Orange made for an excellent novel and movie. A musical it is not. All the well-known characters and scenes are present in this script; the material just doesn't work when set to music--at least not in this version. I was part of one of the first theater groups to perform this very script in the late '90s, and it was embarrassing. I can objectively say that the musical's failure was not in our cast but in this misguided script. The style of the music does not fit the story, which calls for less pop cabaret and more darkness and mystique.

I'm hoping it will get better but my hopes aren't high. I can't believe how long it took Kay to get to her first crime scene. There's more details about the turtle then the actual body. So much details that are off the main plot. Characters seem empty and unreal. The book just seems to drag.
1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens was a remarkable and fearless man who remained true to himself and his beliefs right up until the moment that esophageal cancer claimed his life in December 2011.  Admittedly, Hitchens was a man of excesses, and his lifestyle largely contributed to his death at the relatively young age of sixty-two.  But it is unlikely that he gave much thought to the destructiveness of such a lifestyle until the 2010 book tour during which he was suddenly hospitalized because of the agonizing pain he experienced around his chest and thorax.  Eighteen months later, Hitchens would be dead, but he spent much of his remaining time writing about his personal journey through what he called \\"Tumorville.\\"  That work is captured in Mortality, the little 104-page memoir on dying he left behind.<br /><br />Christopher Hitchens was, of course, not a man without enemies - thousands of them - and, early in his struggle to rid himself of the tumor that killed him, he became aware that \\"some who have long wished me ill\\" were rooting for the \\"blind, emotionless alien\\" of a tumor that was killing him.  If he had not been so outspoken about his atheism and disillusionment with liberal politics, it is likely that far fewer would have openly gloated about his illness.  But if the effectiveness of a man's arguments can be measured by the number of his enemies, Christopher Hitchens was an extremely effective debater.  The man knew he had enemies - and he loved it.<br /><br />I do suspect that admirers of Christopher Hitchens will have already read some of what is in Mortality because portions of the book were published previously as Vanity Fair magazine essays.  Although this might disappoint some readers, keep in mind that the observations Hitchens makes about living with cancer, enduring months of chemotherapy, and the specific \\"etiquette\\" of the disease are so frankly presented that they remain as powerful on subsequent readings as they are on the first.  And, that capturing the essays in one volume the way Mortality does, makes it easy to keep them together for re-reading is an extra bonus.<br /><br />Hitchens was well aware that many people were wondering whether he would turn to religion before his death.  He even stumbled upon a \\"Place Bets\\" video inviting people to bet on whether he would \\"repudiate (his) atheism and embrace religion by a certain date or continue to affirm unbelief and take the hellish consequences.\\"  While he generally found this kind of thing to be more amusing than annoying, Hitchens offers a rather poignant thought about all those prayers supposedly being said on his behalf:<br /><br /> \\"Suppose I ditch the principles I have held for a lifetime, in the hope of gaining favor at the last minute?  I hope and trust that no serious person would be at all impressed by such a hucksterish choice.  Meanwhile, the god who would reward cowardice and dishonesty and punish irreconcilable doubt is among the many gods in which (whom?) I do not believe.  I don't mean to be churlish about any kind intentions, but when September 20 comes (the official \\"Everybody Pray for Hitchens\\" day), please do not trouble deaf heaven with your bootless cries.  Unless, of course, it makes you feel better.\\"<br /><br />Pure Hitchens...all the way to the end.ssays in one volume the way Mortality does, makes it easy to keep them together for re-reading is an extra bonus.<br /><br />Hitchens was well aware that many people were wondering whether he would turn to religion before his death.

1469984202|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There were times I could not read fast enough to find out what happened to the character.  Bernard was a complex character, evil at most times, but seemed sad about his fate when he was talking to Lukas heart to heart below.  But regretfully carried out the Plan.  These are the kind of stories you don't want to end and want to see how their lives unfold in the future.  What about Solo and the kids in silo 17?  Will they be brought back to silo 18.  I guess that's for another book.

Welcome to \\"Mystery Manor.\\"<br /><br />LIKES:<br />1. Good graphics.<br />2. Storyline is easy to follow because there is no plot and the actual story itself is powered by your own imagination. All you know is that you're in some professor's haunted house. You alone get to decide if you're there to sell methamphetamines, sleep with his wife, or commit your first B&E.<br />3. Understandable goals.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1. Quests are super short. Finding 3 objects total in one room isn't a challenge. (Unless I missed pertinent instructions about playing the first few chapters blindfolded.)<br />2. Player goes back and forth between 2 rooms for quite some time. This slowly sucks the joy from your soul and lowers your resistance threshold. I believe this was a conscious decision on the part of the game manufacturers for reason(s) #3 - listed below.<br />3. Player must purchase multiple items needed to keep playing game. Game cash is in the form of diamonds. (You run out of energy and need to eat. One sandwich equals 18 diamonds. You need to unlock a new room. Key costs 6 diamonds. You need a spell to banish a troll. Spell runs 12 diamonds.) Player earns said diamonds at an excruciatingly slow pace. This is deliberate. Manufacturers set this up so players will have to continuously buy diamonds throughout the entire game - with real money. If you are unable to complete a task because you are out of game diamonds then you purchase more on your credit card or stop playing. Those are the only 2 options.<br />4. I don't mind buying games. I have purchased quite a few. However, I want to pay for a game ONCE - not indefinitely.<br />5. Game has tons of pop-up instructions. Said pop-ups are confusing and frustrating. My character is just at the mansion to unload some product. She needs to be in & out quickly. The kids don't have a sitter because only 1 of 4 \\"baby-daddies\\" has a job and money is tight. She just needs to do a quick exchange with the professor - and not sit and listen to some assistant who may or may not be a ghost drone on and on about things that don't matter.<br />6. Player looks for the same objects over and over and over again. In other HO games, when the same location is visited, the player finds different objects in each new challenge. Not so in this game. In the kitchen you will always have to find the fish, broom, wine glass, etc.<br />7. In later levels the player must be linked to friends (through facebook?) to continue advancing in the game. (If I found it relaxing to sell useless crap to my family and friends then I would join AMWAY.) So how about a compromise? In order to level up at the game's halfway mark, each player must sign 3 people up for The Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes.<br /><br />Is this the game for you? Well, if you don't have to worry about money and you love sending chain letters via email with \\"spam\\" attachments then I must say: today's your lucky day! Download & enjoy!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|The bottle cutter is simple and easy to use.  Both my husband and I will enjoy using this product.  Had an old bottle cutter (probably antique) but without instructions.  Now we can use both of them.  Thank you!
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|I thought this book would be full of action and a page turner. I usually finish a book in this series in about 3 days this book however took weeks. This was not one my favorite books. Thumbs down.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I really would like to give 4.75 stars. I had forgotton the cruelty of Heathcliff. My only complaint is that there was too much time spent on the frivolous thoughts of Cathy's daughter. A very engrossing read.  There is so much more to this story than is depicted in the movie and I highly recommend it.  A true classic.  I wish Emily Bronte had written more books.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I got this book as part of the Humble Bundle eBook Edition.  It is one of the most engaging and entertaining book I have read in a while.  This is definitely a page turner and I highly recommend it.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I just finished reading the new JK Rowling The Casual Vacancy.<br />It held you on right along, no slow bits.<br />I loved the interaction with all the families.<br />Very happy with my purchase
B003TSEL7S|5.0|so far i really like this book. it has alot of action and its kind of a mytery. get this book. its a litle expensive but its all worth it.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Very good, quality, top notch show and the quality of the videos are excellent.  Highly recommended for one of the best shows on TV.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is perfect for simple, everyday tasks. Delivers what it promised, no more, no less. Very pleased to have gotten this.
B008XG1X18|1.0|thes. game is a total wast of kandle space. do nor get thes ap. it is totallie poopie. neva get it. NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was excellent. highly recommended for young readers who are looking for a thrill. great for fun and school
B004SBX112|1.0|After ordering the app I checked and it has not appeared.  I've searched the amazon store and find NO place to request assistance.  I'm very unhappy with amazon but have no clue about the app.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|I don't know why people are giving this such a low rating! Yes, the females screw up and one of the men does too. It's called human nature and can be really like that under stressful situations. Personality and attitude came through well with the characters. The leader has very good way of keeping his head and no one wants to listen...or so it seems.<br />This is an amazing video and well worth buying. I have seen it twice now. I am finally buying it!
B006PAZMMK|4.0|Ask yourself one question:<br />Does Skrillex suck?<br /><br />If you answered YES, there isn't much in this to change your mind.<br /><br />If you answered NO, then this is more of what you like.<br /><br />If you answered I DUNNO LOL then go look him up on teh internets and decide.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was recommended to me from a friend who shared my love of 50 Shades.. I was like sure sure. So I bought it. On an off tv night( when there is nothing on to watch) I thought I'd read a chapter or two. I flew through it so fast that I realized I was on chapter 5 within an hour or so of reading! It was past my bed time. So I said I'd return to it the next day. It's now finished! I need to read more of this story. I cannot wait to get the other two books to find out what happens.<br />  There are a few similarities to the story line of 50, but it's  NOT the same book. It does have explicit, erotic writing, and it is not for the  sensitive type. If you don't like dom/sub written characters this is not the book for you.  The characters have real  issues, and they speak very frankly to each other. the action  gets good right at the beginning. No need to read through the first few chapters to get to the \\" good stuff\\".<br /><br /> As I said, it's got some strong adult themes here so if you are sensitive to it, this is not the book for you.There is no bondage or anything like the other mentioned book, but it still contains  strong subject matters. I enjoined it and cannot wait to read more. I have already recommended it to my friend to read so we can discuss.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Took me awhile to figure out how to navigate the site but you can view day; hour etc. I have the fire and had no problem loading it.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|While I applaud the originality in concept, the overall production and story line needs a lot of work. I was really looking forward to watching this, and very disappointed. I would rate this as one of the top worst vampire movies I have scene in a while.
0671027344|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but constantly had a hard time believing Charlie is 15. My cousins are all 13-17 and write blogs (which this book basically is.) Their writing, and the way they talk/communicate with me and others, is much more advanced. This writing reminds me of their middle school works (10-12). \\"I like it. She is nice. I ate a cheeseburger.\\" While this is a small issue, it constantly distracted me from the story -- especially since Charlie's insights appear to be well beyond his years. He has deep thoughts and realizations - not those of a high school freshman (or sophomore)... so his thoughts and writings don't mesh -- it's distracting.<br /><br />As for the story -- it reads a little too much like a novel. For example, although Charlie references Aunt Helen's death in the first pages, he builds up a lot of mystery around it, and this continues until the middle of the book when you finally hear what happened to Aunt Helen. No one would do this in a blog, or letter to a friend/penpal, or in life. You only find all the foreshadowing and suspense in a novel, and the whole point of the book is to make it un-novel like... It feels a little too planned, and a little too much like a 25-35 year old was trying to sound 15... but the story is good, and there are some great lines, usually from other characters, not Charlie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app several times each day to see how much time I left on my non-removable battery.  It works very well and I recommend it.!
B003SI6C4O|5.0|This is a great action adventure with a little bit of scifi mixed in. Good cast.  Edge of your seat suspense keeps you interested and guessing. Overall just a terrific movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is not like 50 shades, but is also very good and I would recommend it to all who love these books.<br />I am hardly waiting for the third part of it.<br />I hope you will enjoy as much as i.
B007PFD90G|5.0|We became interested in the writings of Salman while in England.  He is articulate and paints a story in words.  Was eager to read this latest as it deals with him directly.  Saw him interviewed on TV as the book was just released.  Found it interesting.  Recommend, even if not a Rushdie fan, as it deals with the challenges he faced when the fatwah was placed in effect.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loved this app and used it daily.  After the latest update, it has become incompatible with my 2.2.2 Android phone.  I hope there is a resolution to this issue!
0553801473|4.0|A lot of people complained about the length of this book, and complained about becoming bored, and complained about a perceived lack of moving the plot forward. I did not encounter any of those issues.  I did not become bored at all while reading it. Sure it didn't have as much action and major plot twists as any of the first three, but that it not what I read books for. I found the character's adventures all interesting and the plot was advanced on several levels and in several placed - at the wall, in the North, at King's Landing, in the South, and in Mereen. And since the book was entertaining, I consider its length to be a plus, since it provided me with more hours of enjoyable reading after long days at work.<br /><br />Still, the book is not perfect, and therefore I took off a star. There WERE a lot of unnecessarily long descriptions of various courses at the dinner table, and I don't see why the whole story arc of the Prince of Dorn (can't even remember his name anymore) was even included - he did not do anything that had any effect at all on the rest of the story,******minor spoiler alert in the rest of this paragraph*********and then he died. Surely the dragons didn't need his inept help to escape, it sounded like they would have gotten out on their own, eventually. I will reserve judgement on the new pretender to the throne who suddenly showed up.<br /><br />Also, part of that star is taken away for the sheer length of time that GRR Martin made us wait for this installment. I am increasingly worried that Martin will kick the bucket before he finished the series. He's not getting any younger.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great app wonderful. great bookmark features dictionary search. I recommend this application for any one who loves to read. One of the best free apps available.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is my second time reading..had to own the ebook to take it with me for reading..I love the tale of love and lust
0307341550|5.0|This was the first book that I had ever read by Flynn.  I am happy to say that I now have a author that I want to read more of.  Her characters are full of depth and meaning and have that true human connection.  I stayed up way to late on a couple of nights just wanting to know what was going to come next.  I am happy to say that I truly enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading more of her writing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, I play for hours and hours and I hate playing games. this one is realy A+, go get it and have a blast, enjoy...
B0053KWDES|2.0|It says 10 hours of battery life. While I don't think so.<br />The battery run away quickly. I didn't use the Gain and EQ. And its about 8 hours and battery empty.<br /><br />You know what? the worst part is that you can't use is when its charging. And the charging takes 3 hours.<br /><br />If you forgot to turn it off. Yeah~It will running until battery empty.<br /><br />How do I feel? Generally, I want to listen to some music and in most case, I don't have battery.<br />How do you feel if you want something but you can't? Money is not a big problem.<br />But the disappointing matters.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Excellent for my class<br />I use it everyday to learn    a lot because it is useful for me. just great
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great Alien \\"Prequel\\", \\"and now, the rest of the story\\" .............. Looking forward to more, at least I certainly hope there's more, hopefully getting us to Nostromo's entrance onto the scene anyways.
0812992784|5.0|No suprise at the engaging portrayal of Rushdie's life in hiding. Twenty years have given the author time to hone his story so that it cuts deep and stay with you. Definately adding it to my shelf of must-read-agains. I definately have not eeked all the good from one reading.
0316228532|1.0|So you have read all of Harry Potter books, you love them, and are already anticipating pleasure from reading JKR's first adult novel.<br /><br />You open Amazon Casual Vacancy page and read touching eulogies from leading newspapers, like this one from The Mirror: \\"The Casual Vacancy is a complete joy to read....a stunning, brilliant, outrageously gripping and entertaining evocation of British society today.\\"<br /><br />Of course you buy this enduring masterpiece in the first day of sales, start reading it, and... your bewilderment increases with each page you turns. We were promised joy of reading, well, it is a very specific kind of joy we have here.<br /><br />WARNING: a bit of a spoiler follows.<br /><br />We get gradually acquainted with nice people and happy families populating the jolly town of Pagford.<br /><br />Complacent hypocrites from town council are engaged with their petty politics.<br />A drug-addicted prostitute neglects her children.<br />A daughter hates her bossy mother and starts mutilate herself.<br />A pimp rapes a teenage girl.<br />A father beats and abuses his sons and wife.<br />Mentally ill school vice-principal tries to conceal his unhealthy attraction to his pupils.<br />A 40-something mother of other family is heavily disappointed with her husband and tries to seduce her daughter's teenage classmate.<br />Teenagers bully other teenagers, use drugs, got drunk, and have ugly sex.<br />The same teenagers betray their fathers and mothers by the way of hacking local council website and posting there their parents' deepest secrets.<br />An adult daughter betrays her father's secret to the group of drunken teenagers she sees first time in her life.<br /><br />I must confess that there is one really attractive character in this novel, unfortunately, he dies on page 5.<br /><br />The book starts with a death and, for good measure, ends with a double funeral (drowned little boy and teenage girl committed suicide).<br /><br />And you name all this \\"entertaining evocation of British society\\"?
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is the best TV drama I have watched since \\"24\\".  The writing, directing, and acting all hold my attention from the beginning to the end of each episode.  This year I am watching the weekly individual episodes on Showtime and the plot is much clearer now that I have seen all of Season 1.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I usually love Big Fish games, but this one makes my fire lock up. I have tried to download it three times (at 273 megs that is a big commitment for me) and I just can't get the game to install properly. I am very annoyed by this!
0470901071|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book and it has alot of valuable information, make sure you check the link where the author points some errors and the fix for them, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was the VLSM explanation, to be honest it was really bad and the tables that the author used confused me more. I had to go online and search for another explanation and I understood it in less than 10 mins. I passed the exam.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Don't know why I like it but I do. Been playing for five hours straight now. It's not earth shattering but is fun.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|I saw this film when it came out in 1978, with it's cutting edge special effects of the day... you wouldn't know it now, but that was the dawn of a new age of special effects... Jaws' mechanical shark, and the first Star Wars (before digital remastery). Superman's title sequence alone was very unusual for the day. And after 35 years, the film has held up pretty well, I think mostly thanks to Christopher Reeve's timeless performance and a score by John Williams. I suppose it didn't hurt having Marlon Brando appear in an eternal cameo. That alone will live long after the film (heck, they've already used the footage in later Superman films). The film is still enjoyable, and Christopher Reeve defined the role for the next hundred years. If you listen to [[ASIN:B0044LEBY2 John Williams - Greatest Hits 1969-1999]] and compare all of his original themes, my personal favorite of all is Superman. Better than Raiders or Star Wars (and those are amazing). Superman somehow is the most complete and perfect for the character and the film.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I remember reading \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" when the graphic novel first came out and having to go through it again immediatley.  This story that re-invented, re-envigorated and redefined the franchise has become a staple of Batman fans everywhere.  This animated video adaptation is true to the graphic novel, both in story and in style.  It should be on the shelf of any Batman fan.  I am looking forward to part 2.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|Did not know how they would follow up their self-titled album but they did it! Offering club-like beats but maintaining their mellow-angelic voices. Keep the excellent writing coming :)
B009NQKXYK|4.0|The movie was about what I expected from this type of movie. Not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get pocketinvedit so go to the amazon appstore and download it to edit your inventory just telling you so you can make your game more interesting
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son is 7 and he sits for hours and play this over and over again!! Me too! I recommend this app for everyone!
B008NABUU8|4.0|Great game to play but it needs a free play mode so you could build any bridge without a budget.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fun to play<br />Great graphics<br />Great physics<br />Great puzzle<br /><br />Cons:<br />No free play mode<br />Budget to low for a truck proff bridge
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A pretty fun game to keep you entertained for a good while. The levels are well designed. Not bad at all!
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling, once again, proves her ability to wield a pen and create a world with characters, that suck you in and hold you hostage until the last page, hasn't been diminished at all these past 5 years. The Casual Vacancy is a wonderful novel about...well, reality and the cruel, hidden nature of humans.<br /><br />I'm now excited for her next novel...whatever it may be. :)
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Actually this was a fairly good movie that held my attention through-out. Charlize Theron was great. Chris Hemsworth was okay.  Kristen Steward not so great. Good special effects.  I didnt exactly like the ending however.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Intriguing story, Gillian weaves a novel full of unexpected twists. This was a fast read that constantly kept me on my toes.
B009SRJAG6|5.0|I would love to say \\"Awesome as always...\\" But lets face it, the episodes are not always awesome. However, this season seems to be doing very well. I am pleasantly impressed :)
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|My daughter introduced me to Gillian Flynn. The first book of hers I read was Gone Girl which I couldn't put down.<br />I was so surprised to find Dark Places also kept me captivated. Thoroughly enjoyable. Love this author.
082300659X|5.0|When I first got the book I spent several days reading through it.  It's not a large format, but was very well organized and a good instructional book.  I forgot all about the DVD in the back cover.  But when I did remember and put in the DVD to watch, I was blown away!  It makes such a difference to actually SEE someone going through the process.  The quality is excellent and it was wonderful to follow Juliette's work in the studio, then see various artists discuss their techniques.
B00000F7MS|5.0|PURCHASED THIS FOR A GRANDCHILD VISIT.  HAD TO PLAY IT A FEW TIMES BECAUSE MY GRANDDAUGHTER ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE CHARACTERS & THE MUSIC. THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE 'OLD FASHIONED' FOR HER, BUT SHE DANCED AROUND THE HOUSE SINGING ALONG.
B008IZ7DS6|4.0|Dexter was convincing in his search for the killers-de-jour. I am a fan of Edward James Olmos, and enjoyed seeing him in this and other episodes, even, as it turns out, his character had already come to a bad/frozen end!<br /><br />The sequence of apocolyptic scenerios, as depicted by the Doomsday Killers, was entertaining, as the various paintings or quotes turned into the latest homicides for Dexter and MMPD.<br /><br />Looking forward to Season 7. Thanks.
6304873441|5.0|NOT YOUR USUAL DISNEY FARE - IT'S AN OLDER MOVIE. WASN'T SURE IF MY GRANDDAUGHTER WOULD ENJOY IT, BUT SHE REALLY GOT INTO THE STORY & PLIGHT OF ANASTASIA. SHE'S 8 & I THINK THIS WAS PERFECT AS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOVIES THAT START TO MAKE A PERSON THINK.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Wow. I couldn't put this book  down! I loved every bit, and related to most of what pigeon was going through. Exquisite writing!
B005AUWY90|5.0|BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON.  OF COURSE,I GOT TO SEE IT TOO.  QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST, BUT WAS A PERFECT SPY MOVIE FOR KIDS (ADULTS WERE REMINDED OF THE SPY MOVIES OF THE 1960'S).  GOOD FAMILY FUN!
1401232590|5.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is a great story of Bruce Wayne's early career as Batman<br />and this story is similar to Batman: Year One by Frank Miller, even taking place after<br />it I think.<br /><br />I think Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale did a wonderful job writing and illustrating this, the art,<br />story and characters are that epic and great.<br /><br />The story involves a killer, killing people, namely from a big name mafia family, around<br />the holidays, starting on a Halloween and ending a year later. This book covers all 12 issues<br />with a few pages of extras. The killer is dubbed \\"Holiday\\" btw.<br /><br />Besides Bruce Wayne/Batman, Jim Gordan, Harvey Dent (later to become Two Face in this story)<br />their respective wives, Catwoman/Selina Kyle, The Joker, Calender Man, The Riddler, Solomon Grundy,<br />Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, Poison Ivy, A few mafia family's, and other characters make appearances.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, it is interesting though.<br /><br />All in all, a great, epic and exciting story and artwork to boot.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This DVD was offered at a great price and came in a timely manner.  The movie is wonderful for anyone that likes action and suspense.  If you have never seen it, you will have a real surprise at the end.  It is an edge of your seat movie trying to figure out what will happen next.  You don't want to have to get up in the middle unless you have a pause button.  Enjoy.
034580404X|3.0|When I first sat here undecided about whether or not to buy this trilogy, I did what most logical people did. I read all of the negative reviews just to see what others had to say about it. Unlike a lot of negative product reviews I have read, a lot of these complaints were very founded and I did overall agree with many of the negative points in it. Some things I have noticed that have bothered me about this trilogy:<br /><br />1. The author writes the entire book in present tense. While that is the acceptable format for formal writing, it just sounds very awkward in a work of fiction and has the tendency to make things sound less like a recount of actions and more like a poor attempt at a first person narrator trying to go into third person view without being omniscient.<br /><br />2. The author also repeats a lot of words and phrases. I guess this would qualify under the heading of \\"triteness\\" but in actuality, some of the overused things (\\"I blushed/flushed\\" for example) can easily be taken as one of the only ways to describe the main character's reaction to an event. Still, a lot of things were very much overused.<br /><br />3. Inner Goddess vs. Subconscious - To be honest, I didn't very much enjoy this extended metaphor of her \\"other selves\\" throughout the trilogy because they seemed unnecessary and happened to do very unrelated things (\\"My subconscious looks up from...and scolds me...\\" or \\"My inner goddess puts a rose between her teeth and does the tango...\\") when in actuality these unrelated things don't effectively get the point across in the descriptive way that the author was apparently aiming for. Not bashing the two entities in themselves, however I believe that they could have been used more effectively in the series than the way they were.<br /><br />4. This bothers some others more than it does for me, but I will state it anyway. The book is supposed to be about an American woman who graduated with a degree in Literature, but she has so many British tendencies that it makes one wonder if the author did any research on American culture before deciding to write about an American woman.<br /><br />Overall, I actually did enjoy the books. The plot to me is very interesting, and the only way I am able to read through mediocre writing is if the plot is interesting enough. This plot was definitely interesting, although many may not agree with me. Without giving away any spoilers, the characters themselves (including the sub-main characters) are all very distinct. I will say that it seems as though the main character doesn't really turn into a dynamic figure until more towards end of the second book/beginning of third book. Three stars because I did enjoy the plot, minus two because of my complaints in the way it was written.<br /><br />If you decide to try it, I suggest trying the books with an open mind.endencies that it makes one wonder if the author did any research on American culture before deciding to write about an American woman.<br /><br />Overall, I actually did enjoy the books.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is a great book not only about the Bin Laden raid but the overall career as a Navy Seal of the author.  The book is very easy to read and is very hard to put down.  Best account you will hear about the raid on Bin Laden.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|It is a good a book so far. It will HELP you. Most will not help you a lot. BEAST.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|never released in 3D but made with real IMAX Cameras......? Love to have this on Blu-Ray in IMAX Cameras recordings.....?
B002ITWSUQ|2.0|The directors must think we are all stupid.  But in reality, they are.  This movie makes sure to put inappropriate family dialogue (sexual) in the first 10 minutes, spoiling it for parents of children.  We turned it off after we had had enough.  I watched it later alone to see if we should let the kids watch it.  It did get better with less sexual innuendos but the characters were Americans???? acting as Brits????  The whole thing was just stupid!  So many of the characters acted like idiots.<br /><br />The only redeeming message was that like Dorothy, she had the power all along to change her face.  She just needed to like herself the way she was.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Not good cant find word s easily did not like it at all sucks kangaroo noses and that smells down south
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I purchased the first episode with some Amazon Credit that they were giving out for Tweeting Amazon. Anyhow, I really enjoyed this episode and I am watching the 2nd one as I type this. I hope I do not get any nightmares but it is rather creepy. I like the fact that they are not predictable as to what is going to happen and they catch the audience by surprise. I highly recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its a great game not bad but who ever made this game should be more than dropping coins im being surious it should be more than that
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very impressive relative to other games of this genre. it had depth, great music, and good graphics. lots of enjoyment and will last you awhile
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 Shades for me!!! Love Gideon and Eva! Keep em coming!!! HOT, INTENSE and ADDICTING! The second book even better! Cannot wait for the 3rd!!
B009VB7OV2|5.0|GG is back and better than ever! For all the fans out there, this is a great sequel to the other 5 seasons. I think we have all been waiting to see nate, serena, blair, chuck, and the others grow up.
034580404X|4.0|All the books are a very easy and quick read.  They are fun; a great way to escape for an hour...or a few.  Only thing that really turned me off was that the \\"sex scenes\\" are very repetative.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|Mike Senior wrote a great book for those who are beginning in audio production, those who teaches and for professionals. I really recommend it.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This movie will appeal to adults and children who are fans of scary stories. Coraline has just moved to a new house. She is bitter about it and is not too fond of her new neighbors. Coraline finds a secret door which leads to another world. In the other world she meets other mother and her life is as she dreamed. However, things are not always as they seem. Other mother turns out to evil. Coraline must not only escape the other world but free her real parents and defeat other mother.<br /><br />I have read in other reviews with concerns about how frightening this film is. However, it is rated PG, and therefore is not for young children to begin with. If parents are searching for a non-spooky Halloween film then I would recamend \\"It's the great pumpkin Charlie Brown\\" or \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Frankenstein\\".<br /><br />There is a brief moment of nudity which is non-sexual. One of the elderly ladies portraying \\"The birth of Venus\\". I do not find it offensive. Here is where I am coming from, when I was in elementry school my class took a feild trip to an art meseum and the first thing the teachers showed us was a statue of Venus in the nude. Seeing that statue did not harm any student on the feild trip, the teachers were teaching us about the history of art. If parents are concerned about thier children seeing that scene they could just skip it.<br /><br />Hope my review is helpful
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I love old Rockabilly music.  I think that all started when I heard Bruce Springsteen do \\"Summertime Blues\\" on an old bootleg years and years ago.  I looked up the original and was hooked.  Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran became favorites of mine as did the Stray Cats.  I loved how Brian Setzer kept the Rockabilly vibe with new songs and always wished there were more artists keeping the flame burning.<br /><br />It was about a year ago when I was looking through my recommendations here on Amazon and came across Imelda May.  I read that she was an Irish born singer doing Rockabilly and I just had to check her music out.  I was absolutely floored.  Her music has an absolute amazing energy, vibe and attitude.  Exactly what Rockabilly should be.<br /><br />It is one of the rare discs where I never skip a song from the rocking first track \\"Johnny Got A Boom Boom\\" through the last track on the disc \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\" which rocks you until the final moment with a nice horn arrangement.  In between you'll find one of the sexiest songs you'll ever hear in \\"Knock 123\\" where Imelda's breathy delivery is just perfection.  The songs on this album draw comparisons to some of the early Beatles work, some jazz and some heartfelt ballads.  Overall a perfect mixture of each.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you like good music at all you should check this disc out and if you are a Rockabilly fan you need to have this disc in your collection.
B0068THAGY|4.0|A pleasant and entertaining surprise. Some stuff within the script is thinly stretched, but the kids faces remind you of the genre, and allows you to accept the soft spots.
B008S80P38|4.0|Deadmau5's music has always been a continuous flow of energy-enthralled EDM (Electronic Dance Music), but sometimes his tenacious stagnation never ceases to amaze me. This album doesn't necessarily take his music \\"to a new level\\", but you can only go so far with EDM, as it's a very straight-forward genre in the electronic universe. Regardless, it's definitely worth a listen, as it gets the job done of your body wanting to move with the music. Review written by Colin Jones
B008WCP2KG|3.0|This movie is AWFUL.  Seriously, just bad.  I saw it in the theater AND I pre-ordered the DVD/BluRay/Ultraviolet combo.  So why would I want to own a movie I already knew was bad?  Can you say Channing Tatum bumping and grinding on the dance floor?  Channing Tatum is at his luscious best in this film as far as his dancing and body, but it's like he totally forgot how to act at all (not that he was Oscar material before this anyway).  The dancing in this movie is excellent and SO.HOT. and Matthew McConaughey is awesome when he's used for comic relief (when it gets serious even the great McConaughey is pretty bad).  The plot and even most of the acting in this movie is just downright pitiful.<br /><br />Would I own the movie?  YEP, I DO.  Would I watch the movie more than once? Yep, I have.  Would I say it's cinematic magic worthy of an Oscar? NO WAY.  Do I recommend this movie to pretty much all women who might kind of like the look of Channing Tatum?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend this movie if you are looking for a decent plot and good acting?  No, no, I don't, please stay far away from this movie if that is what you are looking for!<br /><br />The dancing and serious babe factor of this movie gets 10 stars, everything else gets -7...makes this one an even 3 stars for me.
B007SPPANM|2.0|I wasn't expecting the movie to be split into two discs.  I thought I was getting the movie and a separte disc with the special features. It was dissapointing when half way through the movie stopped and said change to 2nd disc.  I would suggest finding the movie with it all on one disc unless you don't mind the movie being split into two segments.  the movie is fantastic it's just the way it's set up in this dvd set.
1455527475|5.0|I enjoyed the book and the humor Greg Smith used in his account of his experience at Goldman Sachs and Wall Street. I admire Greg Smith for telling the truth about an industry that the industry does not want told. This is a book that should be read not by industry insiders, but by everyone so that they can understand what really runs our country and the corruption that runs rampant throughout the financial industry. I applaud that Greg had the personal integrity to tell the truth. I recommend that everyone read this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I want to recommend a book I just finished reading. The Book Thief is a very wonderfully written & touching story. It's not a new book (2006) but I just recently ran across it. I decided to read it because I've never seen a book that's been on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 230 weeks.<br /><br />From the write up on it you wouldn't think this is a beautifully written book (\\"Narrated by Death\\" - yikes!) but Zusak's writing style is quite lyrical and achingly beautiful in some passages... \\"At those times, in the enormous mileage of sleep, she had never felt so completely alone.\\" ... `the enormous mileage of sleep'... I like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|You just cant be the classics. Read the book because I wanted to be reminded of what vampires where though to be. Unlike the way Hollywood has changed that perspective truly enjoyed the book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Loved this book, especially the way it ended. I have told friends about it & they want to read it also.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love this series! Characters are so well developed and interesting. Recommend it to everyone who likes British dramas like Upstairs Downstairs.
B0086449YA|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend, who is a huge Knopfler fan. He has listened to the cd every night since he got it. I bought him the deluxe set which didn't arrive, so I got him the cd because he was going crazy not hearing the new music. We are going to see Knopfler in November. Anyone who has never seen him needs to make this a priority!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the game, wish it was longer! :-) Big Fish did it again, brought out a game I couldn't put down, LOL! Worth the $2.00 and no problems with installing or playing in my kindle fire! GET THE GAME, YOU'LL LOVE IT!
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Definitely no thrill whatsoever.  I kept waiting for something exciting to happen.  But it never did.  Its an ok movie, no exciting over the top action like I am used to from Hollywood.  No political undertones which was good, I expected it would an anti-republican movie before I watched it.  It was kind of interesting although the characters didn't hold my attention very well, I couldn't watch this if it was a TV series.  It's just ok, not bad but not great either.
B000VHXBIU|4.0|I had heard of this movie from the late 80s but only watched it in 2012. I enjoyed it, I must say. Well worth renting. What more do you want me to say?
B009329ZF2|4.0|We enjoyed the movie the first time we saw it, so we bought it. It is entertaining and we like these type of movies.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A real psycological thriller! Kept trying to figure it out. Without giving it away, all I can say is Read It!
B00136NWLE|4.0|Typical Billy Joel easy to listen to ballads and some rocking songs as well. Well recorded. Nice discount on the album.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|this was a great game!!! I was really impressed with the complexity and the plot!! it didn't freeze and the graphics were impressive!!
B005S0HNU2|5.0|Mystery, suspense, adventure and more. Merlin has always a new way of solving thing. The dragon is fabulous!!<br />Great series as always are the british ones.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am ALWAYS playing this game...on the train ride to work, before bed, while doing laundry.  I like that you don't have to be connected to wifi, which is impossible on the train!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|like the way this game gives you stuff to do but also lets you go atvyour on pace with it.  wish they didnt have cash however.  i would ratber use coins than cash.
0553381407|1.0|Parental blunders are a problem, but this book does not give good guidance about getting past the issues. It discourages forgiveness and encourages blame. This book advocates a very self-centered focus without reconciliation of the issues in a wounded adult-child's heart. Definitely on the bottom of my list of 'healing' books to recommend to people to read.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I listened to this album on repeat for about a week on my runs.  It's super mellow, and has some great new songs.  I saw these guys live last year and they are high quality performers.  I recommend getting the deluxe edition - The Boxer is an awesome cover.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|5 stars!!! i love the house of night series i borrowd te actual books fom my friend and  i loved them!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although I  thought that it started a bit slow it did get better so you must be patient.  I got involved with the lives of the characters and cared about what happened to them.  It is definitely a departure from the Harry Potter series.  I like Ms. Rowling's character development.  I would recommend the book but do not think it's her best effort.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Gotta give it up to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, staying true to themselves, true to their city, and living their passion on their terms.. Great album, even better knowing its an indy...see these guys live, I did in reno and seattle, and both times their energy was unreal...
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I have read only one other book by this author, The Snowman, and while not the greatest of reads, it was moderately interesting. However I quit this one about a quarter of the way----very unusl for me. It reads like a 1950 Mickey Spillane novel The characters are uninteresting and very shallowly drawn. An infinite number of references to many buildings, locations, streets, parks that may have meaning to a Norweigan but a struggle for other readers.The book deals with the return of a detective to Oslo and the changes, for the worst, that he finds----expecially drugs. He takes on the murder by his surrogate son, that seems open and shut. The mother of the boy is his lover and their relationship is also thinly drawn. Really boring.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I began reading King years ago, way back with \\"The Stand\\". I quit somewhere around \\"Thinner\\" because I felt he was resting on his laurels and nowhere near as creative (or scary) as he had been. This book seems to belong in the post-\\"Thinner\\" era. Concept is entertaining but feels like he's using the book for a trip down memory lane.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love the movie, very fun  for me as someone who does not read comic books.  I presume it's more enjoyable if you watched the lead up movies if each character, as I have.
1449410243|3.0|First of all, I really enjoy The Oatmeal. Though I'm not a crazy cat lady, I like cats and can appreciate the humor. I knew the book was about cats when I bought it. That said, the humor in this book is good, but I didn't find it to be as laughing-out-loud hilarious as the dolphin book... and it's simply too short. As other reviewers have noted, much of the book is simply one panel per page, and it takes a lot of pages to get to a decent joke.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is not a sugary sweet tale of \\"interconnectedness,\\" a masterwork of making Tom Hanks look as divergent as possible, a gimmicky post-modern style of story-telling, yet another exposition of the \\"butterfly effect,\\" or an attempt to proselytize reincarnation.  It's much more robust than media is letting on.<br /><br />As I was reading it, I was as nervous as I was engaged. Engaged because Mitchell is both a mesmerizing story-teller and the teller of a great story. Nervous that his nested style of storytelling would either overshadow content, or leave loose ends untied. There's nothing to worry about here. Leaving me counting down the days until it's film release, slated for Friday October 26.<br /><br />Though I don't think media should be used to judge a film, I do think it's appropriate to allow a book to judge it's translation. Here's what fired my synapsis in the book, and what I'll need to see in the film to be as impressed as review audiences.<br /><br />First, a word on its genre. Words like \\"saga\\", postmodern, \\"epic mind bender,\\" or \\"Russian nested dolls\\" may all be accurate but they miss the larger point. This is an apocalyptic story chronicling the rise and fall of civilization from 1830 into the distant future. Here you see the seeds, symptoms, bloatedness, and after effects of power run amok. Like all good apocalyptic literature, the more an author connects with current reality, the more power of analysis the story has. It asks us where we're heading and why in that direction, and what sent us there. And this story has a lot of power. Cloud Atlas belongs on the shelf beside The Road, Oryx and Crake, The Hunger Games, The Matrix, 1984, and Animal Farm.<br /><br />Second, if apocalyptic is the genre, the story itself is the abuse of power. In six stories, all of which can stand on their own, he imagines what unfolds when one person or group claims dominance over another, putting self interest over the common good. The landscape of soul and societyhe paints is both heartbreaking and convicting. And the more hopeless he paints the world, the tighter his indictment of Nietzsche's Will to Power and Ayn Rand's Social Darwinism becomes. \\"If we believe humanity is a ladder of tribes, a colosseum of confrontation, exploitation and bestiality, such a humanity is surely brought into being, and histories [antaganists] shall prevail. You and I, the moneyed, the privileged, the fortunate, shall not fare so badly in this world, provided our luck holds.\\"<br /><br />How have humans abused power and expressed dominance in the real and fictional world? Mitchell uses at least the following to move his story forward: Friendship, Race, Religious Mission, Colonization, Nationalism, Corporitization, Hierarchy, Otherization, and Dehumanization.<br /><br />If I say this is about class struggle or those on the margins being in tension with those in power you might too easily dismiss the point. It's more internally focused. Pushing us to examine the narratives we unconsciously live by that define and sustain the borders between us. As Thomas Merton, said in the 1960s: \\"Instead of hating the people you think are war makers, hate the appetites and the disorder in your own soul, which are the causes of war.\\" [366 Ways to Peace Calendar, Herald Press.]<br /><br />In one key scene where a rebel is interviewed by the regime, the interviewer implores disbelief at what he's heard, \\"It's unconscionable, no, it's blasphemy!... I am impelled to say, what you saw, must have been a [fictional] set, created for your benefit [by the Revolutionaries]...The Beloved Chairman would never permit it...No crime of such magnitude could take root\\" in our country. Elsewhere he quips that they live in the sturdiest social pyramid ever constructed!<br /><br />In other words, blindness granted by the doctrine of National Exceptionalism (either in the fictional or real world) is the granting of permission for injustice to occur. Her response is telling, \\"In a cycle as old as tribalism, ignorance of the Other engenders fear; fear engenders hatred; hatred engenders violence; violence engenders further violence until the only `rights,' the only law, are whatever is willed by the most powerful.\\"<br /><br />Third, there are two primary ways Cloud Atlas unpacks the abuse of power. 6 years before the Supreme Court Case Citizens United determined that corporations have peoplehood, Mitchell imagines a world completely authored and sustained by corporate interests. Every shoe is now a nike, every coffee a starbuck, every car a ford. But also every decision a consumer decision. Every social gradation of power based on purchasing capacity, every border delineating space between consumer and producer, every ecological \\"deadzone\\" a necessary step of economic development. There are the haves, and the have nots; and for Mitchell these are writ large through what he terms Corpocracy, the corporitization of the state.<br /><br />Jesus said you can not serve both God and mammon. Ayn Rand of course agreed with this, choosing mammon in her hallmark Atlas Shrugged. Mitchell unmasks this for what it really is: morally bankrupt at every level.<br /><br />But he also unpacks the abuse of power by exploring Violence on many levels, particularly imperialism and colonization. In a near final scene that solidified this books worth in my mind, a debate rages regarding \\"Why is it that the musket came to the White man and not, say, the Esquimeau or the Pygmy...?\\" The Christian missionary surmises it is because of the \\"august will of the Almighty\\" that \\"leads Humanity up the ladder towards the godhead\\" and thus justifies enormous violent oppression and extermination. While the man of science rebuts it is rather humanities' will to power. Another character chimes, \\"What sparks wars? The will to power, the backbone of human nature... you can see the will to power in bedrooms, kitchens, factories, unions, and the borders of states...the nation state is merely human nature inflated to monstrous proportions.\\"<br /><br />Both philosophies have wrecked havoc in our own world, and, when read in light of the cross and teachings of Jesus Christ, are blasphemous idolatries.<br /><br />As in most apocalyptic literature, Mitchell's social analysis (his loud \\"No!\\") outweighs his creative solutions. But create he does, giving hope that Cloud Atlas need not be our own future.
0761171703|5.0|Dancers Among Us is a truly remarkable work of art celebrating the multiple facets of our life and their expression through dance. The work is meticulous and impeccable and ranges from heart-breaking to awe inspiring. I love how Jordan has included an anecdote for the process he went through to get each photograph and his enthusiasm and love for his work shine through in this book. I recommend it for EVERYONE!
B000002U88|3.0|Yea, I did see the reviews about  the lack of sound quality from others that purchased this CD, but I thought, how bad could it be - it's a CD. Well, to me, it was pretty noticeable. I added this to my iPod, along with my other \\" store bought \\"CD's of Bob Seger that I own, and there is a definite difference in sound quality. This must be a copy, of a copy, squared! I tried to download it from iTunes, but it is not available there. At some point, I will dig out my old vynil album and load it that way. I'm sure it will sound better than this. Gave three stars because it arrived as advertised, and I was warned about the quality beforehand.
B00914JWSW|1.0|I am a big fan of anything Diana Krall sings and have all of her CDs.  But...the latest - Glad Rag Doll is simply the worst. It should have not been published, sounds like it was done is someone's basement, and was a bad idea. I could not find one song that's worth listening to. Krall has hit bottom on this CD.  She has not released many CDs over the past couple of years and this release was obviously a desperate attempt to get something...anything out the door. Really bad news for Krall listeners.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone. Our military is truly a force of professionals dedicated to mission and country. Thanks for telling the story.  Thanks for your service to this country and Job Well Done.
0307887448|5.0|I've had this book for 3 months, and I'm currently reading it for the fifth time.  Every time I start reading it, I can't put it down and end up staying up late to keep pushing through for more, even though I already know what's going to happen.<br /><br />People who grew up in the '80s (or are heavily aware of pop culture from that decade), especially people are who slightly geek-oriented, will love this book...  and even if you're not, it's still very enjoyable.  \\"Ready Player One\\" is a well-written, enthralling read that is fast-paced and very entertaining, and I highly recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another brilliant work by Rick Riordan. The story is rich and full of twists that keep you entertained. And as always, it ends in a literal cliff hanger that makes you wish there was a real life godly way that Riordan could use to quickly pump out the next edition.<br /><br />Great book. Great stories. I recommend to all who love mythology and good reads. I also recommend for young and old readers, because the book is just simply fun.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare spins an exciting story that delves further into the amazing characters she delivered in the previous two book. Plenty of twists(some obvious) keep readers hooked. Great book!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Lately, it takes a really really good book to catch my interest and hold it. And I go through a lot before I stumble into one. I stumbled into this and even though it's sad and you get the feeling things aren't going to turn out well; I still thought it was a great book. At first, I didn't like the way the story was being told. Near the end it seemed the best way to do it ;almost brilliant. I wish I could find a book this good every week.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I downloaded and it wont even load. I deleted nearly everything on my fire and now it just frezzes at the home page. :(

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but it's being marvelous!<br />I was worried if it would meet the first book's level and I have no complaints.<br />Again, is an intriguing story inserted in a historical moment perfectly described.<br />As all the author's previous books, this one is a remarkable work of historic research.<br />Congratulations!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Indeed this appears to have been written by a teenager. Implausible story, characters across the board, settings and occasions. Gawd help us if the is popular literature.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The packaging could have been better, an HD iTunes Digital Copy would have made it so much better! Otherwise is was pretty good!

B002UEW31I|5.0|Hands down one of the best films to come out in the last ten years.  Tarantino is one of a handful of directors who are making films that are both masterfully crafted and still commercially viable.  Amazing performances, beautiful imagery and hilarious and poignant action.  Glad I have this in my collection now.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|So far Taylor's best album!!!! I love how it has a mixture of almost very music genre  which makes it pleasant to listen to. I wouldn't b surprised if this would be Taylor Swift's most successful album yet!!!!!
B003ZMF26W|1.0|The mouse worked great... for 8 months and then out of nowhere it died. I am very computer and electronics savvy so I pulled it apart. Aperently a wire broke inside the braided wire where it meets the mouse. Now I can attempt to resplice the wire and it will look like crap, try to order a wire, if one exists, or cough up another 75-200$ for another gaming mouse. What is call BS no matter what. And no mailing it in to be fixed is not an option because like I said its not worth it if it keeps doing this to me. I have a MS mouse from the '90's that will work till I get a new one. Pretty much explains the quality right there. It was beat out by a '90's mouse.

B00371QQ0M|4.0|I saw Dune at the theater when it was released in 1984.  I had read the book just a few months prior to watching the movie, probably the best way to view it.  Yes, this movie is flawed, but I recall being blown away by the overall majesty of it.  When Kyle Mc shouts in the desert, \\"Father, the sleeper has awakened!\\" or when his little sister sways in the ruins, her smile the same shape as the dagger she holds, or when the air-craft carrier-size sand worm crashes onto Dune's surface, I had a feeling of watching a movie much more profound than the sum of all its parts.<br /><br />I saw it again for the first time in decades just a year or two ago when Netflix offered it on Instant View.  It wasn't the big screen, but it was a big enough home tv flat screen, and the sense of transcendence some scenes inspired was not lost.  Last time I checked a few weeks ago, Netflix had removed it from Instant View potential!  I put the blu-ray version of the movie on my Xmas wish list, long past time.  But be very careful to NOT buy the extended version, if it exists.  That was terrible.  Buy the version that starts with the narration by Princess Irina against the back drop of deep space.<br /><br />The movie gets across the idea inherent in the novel: the improvement of human faculties can result in astonishing scientific advances, versus the current fascination with computers and machines.  The spice, mined only on the desert planet Dune, creates Mentats, humans who can perform calculations at a speed light-years above the average intelligence.<br /><br />The spice allows humans to mentally \\"fold space\\" and make interstellar travel possible, although the process causes a rapid evolution of the body resulting in the grotesque.  Females have banded together to create their own form of a guild, the Bene Jeseret, relying on accelerated witch-like powers of the human voice to control another's actions, and yes, to destroy like a round of C4 with a perfectly modulated voice alone.<br /><br />\\"He who controls the spice controls the universe.\\"  The spice, a substance existing only on the planet Dune, is what allows these unimaginably enhanced human capabilities.  The natives of the planet are the Fremen, regarded as servants, believed to be a transient, powerless desert people(sound familiar?) suffering from the exploitation of their vital resource.<br /><br />In the Dune interstellar universe, power is wielded by great houses and inherited by the equivalent of princes.  Think of the Italian city states of the doges or the medieval German principalities.  The great houses cooperate to the extent of assigning the responsibility of maintaining the mining of spice for all on Dune to a favored house.<br /><br />And so the movie begins with a young prince accompanying his royal parents (I know, I know, the bene jeserit mother is a concubine) to the planet Dune, over which the house Atreides has been granted control to keep the spice flowing for the League and all others in the galaxy with power....<br /><br />This all sounds convoluted, and it is to an extent, but the first release of the movie, even if you don't know all the fictional background, has a power and majesty to it that can't be denied.  Some scenes will send shivers up your spine, so profound do they seem.  Can't wait for a blu ray version!
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I love this show, I just need to get the rest of the seasons now, I can't wait till season three and four lower in price.
030758836X|4.0|Well written, thought provoking. Not sure that I lived the story, but I won't forget reading. I will read more by this author for sure
1616960922|5.0|Again, Brandon writes an insightful beleivable character and does it in short order. I have loved his other novels and his recent novella \\"Legion\\" so I was ready to jump all over this book. The story is a short one but I felt very satisfied at the end, the story felt complete. If you enjoyed his other works this one will not disappoint you. Well done Mr. Sanderson!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love Sons Of Anarchy and Amazon Instant Videos was a very convenient way to watch one of my favorite shows. I love the fact that it allowed me to watch SOA whenever and wherever. I would recommend this show to anyone 18 and up who enjoys biker/gangster shows.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was a great read, and quick as well.  It took me a couple of days to get through it, and like every other Mitch Albom book, it makes you think once you're finished.  To anyone interested in this book, I recommend it.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|If you have not read Inman's first book (How to Punch a Dolphin in the face), but that instead and pass this one. The book is mildly humorous, but lacks the inspiration which made the author's original work so entertaining.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book to read.  Very well written with no typos, which I greatly appreciate, as I find several kindle books to have typographical errors in them which drives me nuts!  The ending was quite a surprise -- was not expecting that.  Very original.  I would give it five stars.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've read a lot of Sylvia Day's books and this one is one of her best.  Can't wait for the next book is this series.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app.  My 3-year old grand daugter loves to draw and can draw to her hearts content without manuevering or deleting all my other apps. My two 10-year olds can get very intricate with their drawings.  I'm still in the stick figure stage but I'm sure I'll get better with practice.
0646497855|4.0|I found this book very useful in my preparation for my IELTS exams it has clear and good explanations and I recommend it to other people
B0091REZMW|3.0|i hate when it closes for no reason but its a fun game, although i wont be purchasing through it so i dont know how long i'll play it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really could not stop reading this book.  I have already started the second in this trilogy.  The characters became real to me and I just love all the history.  Definitely would recommend.  Both me and husband read this one and loved it and we never read the same books!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Movie got here exactly when I expected for a lower price. You gotta love that pre-order lower price guarantee. Happy customer here.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app use to be great but after the update only about 10 statuses load and the rest are blue and messed up and won't load. I hope they fix this soon!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Especially if you like to dance. I absolutely love this cd, it's got great grooves & energy for when you want some pep. Plus Chris's awesome singing! Listen to Get Up, that's a good example of what you'll get w this cd. His singing is different to go with the faster music, still amazing of course & I looove the lyrics!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am not a \\"Gamer\\" but I enjoy Pop Culture.  That said,it does make me want to go back and find my old Atari game console and see if I can't do better on a second try.  Interesting story concept, the pace was quick, and characters were fully fleshed out and believable.  I recommend this book to anyone that does enjoy gaming, Pop Culture, or just a great story.  Hopefully, Mr. Cline will write another gem like this one!
145162445X|1.0|This should be a good book, the subject matter is interesting and has great scope on the practical and theoretical side, but it isn't.<br /><br />Krauss turns an interesting subject into a dull slog, he doesn't present either a logical progression of discovery or of time but instead jumps around in an annoying and confusing manner. There are a lot of facts here and a lot of things I didn't know but the journey should be interesting not just the facts and this journey was frustrating.<br /><br />Krauss also insists on putting religion into the book at every turn making snide comments and trying to appear smart at the expense of people who believe in the literal truth of religion instead of science.<br />This is very tiresome, and is just preaching to the choir since I can't imagine many people picking up this book who don't believe science holds the answers to the important questions and, even when I am in complete agreement, I find being smugly preached at irritating.<br /><br />I was hoping for something like Ian Sample's excellent book [[ASIN:B00847H66C Massive: The Hunt for the God Particle [Paperback]] but instead got something that isn't science, isn't philosophy and isn't good.<br /><br />A missed opportunity.
0316228532|1.0|The Casual Vacancy is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I feel the purchase of this expensive book was a rip off.  This is a depressing book, full of unlikable characters who fight with each other and swear at each other constantly.  I am surprised they have not all committed suicide.  I could not finish the book, because it was such a downer.  I see no redeeming features in the book, and I am stunned the author would write such a vituperative and degrading story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the 2 books in this series and anxiously waiting for the next one. A friend told me to read them because they were similar to 50 Shades, but not as intense.  We absolutely loved these books!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I read all of coonelly's book, but black ice was my favorite so far. Full of twists and turns and surprises that you really brings out his style of writting. wonderfull
B004R1VXYU|4.0|These guys are pretty good so do yourself a favor and hive them a listen.a good southern rock sound with some bluegrass influence.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is the kind of film to see when you just want to feel good. I will probably never tire of the British cast - all pros we have come to adore for their elegant acting and brilliant comic timing - nor the lovely Indian innocence that shines through Sonny, the endlessly optimisic hotel owner whose establishment is crumbling all around him despite his tireless love for it. Like many others who have written reviews for this film, I do wish there were more like it, just as I wish that more of the people we come into contact with on a daily basis could be as lovely as these characters! One to treasure - and emulate.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|This movie has a lot going for it.  Action,beautiful girls, blood, villians and good guys to root for.  It will keep you entertained for a long time.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a fun game. I got it when it was the free app of the day.  So I have been slowly playing it since and I believe I'm just about done. :D
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is another good action movie that will keep you entertained.  I just wish there was more of it.  Liam Neeson is superb.  Well worth the money.
B004PHE9F6|4.0|I saw this movie when it first ran in Cinerama. It was an experience I'll never forget. It was a very wide curved screen, lit up by three projectors.<br /> The movie doesn't have a plot. The actors basically fill in scenes in between races. It's about the experience of formula one racing in 1966. The racing footage is realistic and historic. Seeing it in this 1080p HD wide screen format does the cinematography justice. It works really well on HD big screen TV with surround sound.<br /> If you're a race fan this Blue Ray version is the one to have.
B00005J9PB|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites! Sadly the seller didn't specify that these dvds they make can not be used in an American made DVD player. Buying this product from them was useless and sadly a waste of my money. Some of us aren't tech savvy enough to check the region code, considering I didn't even know what that was until I purchased this item. Anyway the movie is incredible, but I can't rate the item as I should because of the fact I can't even watch the movie..
B0086700CM|5.0|it was enjoyable and totally family friendly a game for all ages!!!! it is very addicting but fun!!! I reccomened it to everyone who wants to waste some time!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game. Had fun. No problems! The puzzle play is entertaining. I also enjoyed the story. 5 thumbs up. Will go and check out their other games.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|PLEASE FIX THE VIDEO PLAYER AMAZON....SHITTY PAUSES AND NOT PLAYING CORRECTLY...HAVE A HIGH VIDEO CARD BUT DOESNT SEEM LIKE IT BECAUSE THE PLAYER REALLY SUCKS.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385535147|3.0|The Racketeer is an ok read if you like Grisham, but there are no real surprises here.  I found a lot in the plot was reminiscent of The Firm.<br />I like Grisham, but would really like to see him step it up and surprise me after all these years. Wait for the paperback.
0316228532|2.0|so sad to me -  even though I waited for 60 other people to finish (or not finish) reading this library book, I still don't care for this story -<br /><br />putting aside the fact that J K Rowling was a hero in my mind (I thought the HP books were GENIUS), I still wouldn't enjoy this book -  I just don't care for 'dark' tales, I face enough of it, and don't care to read it in my 'spare' time<br />it's just people treating each other badly, that doesn't float my boat<br /><br />I LOVE british/european TV and writing - have recently finished all the kate atkinson books (jackson brodie) and various TV shows (vera, commander, prime suspect, cracker, hamish macbeth)<br />yes, there is also 'darkness' in those mentioned above, but there must be something else, because I'm glued to them<br /><br />done about half of this book, and not sure I'll finish it - I figure if it were going to grab me, it should have happened by now - cut my losses<br />I'm just not invested in the characters, don't really care yet what happens to them . . . not even one of them (perhaps sukhvinder ? probably not)<br />frankly I'm bored, and have to push myself to continue<br /><br />funny/witty hmmmm, haven't laughed yet
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I don't know what possessed me to order this online.<br />I think it was a sale going on.<br />Either way I got it cheap and I love the movie.<br />The Blu-ray transfer seems very vivid and the sound is great.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was an interesting way to continue the series. When he wrote the book he incorporated a great amount of ancient greek and roman history. This allowed the reader to read an informatonal yet entertaining book. I recommend this book and hope that you will read it.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I did a web search for cr2032 batteries to power Blackburn Click from and rear bike lights because cr2032 are hella expensive at the store.<br />I found a couple of places here that sell a these 5 packs for under $3.  Usually can't get 1 or maybe 2 at local store for less than $3 or $4.<br />Great deal.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I hate to even write this, I'm a huge Dr Who fan and bought this for a Halloween costume this year, but the build quality leaves so much to be desired on this piece.<br /><br />It just feels horribly flimsy.  I can't uncap the pen nib without pulling the whole pen base off half the time, the plastic creaks like it wants to split when I extend it (no, I didn't over-tighten the screw inside the slider), the thumb tab was removed only once to install the batteries and now it feels like it's barely staying on after snapping it back into place. The head piece is just slightly crooked where it was glued to the stalk, and I worry that one of these days, that's the point where it's going to snap. Even the casting seams weren't properly cleaned up before applying this very thin layer of paint.<br /><br />The sound effects were a bit bland as well.  Just two sounds, basically the same sound actually, in 2 different keys....not even noticeably different unless you press it multiple times in a row and listen carefully.<br /><br />It's still a required prop, no question about it, you can't have a Doctor costume without a sonic screwdriver. It's just that this one looks, feels and sounds more like what I'd expect from a knock off, not a $30 licensed product.  I thought I was just being too picky, then I let my 9 year old son play with it and he pointed out half the same complaints I had.<br /><br />I guess all in all it's an \\"okay\\" piece, but one I wouldn't want to spend more than $10-15 on if I had actually held it in my hands before deciding to buy it.  $5-7 if it didn't have the licensed name inflating the price
B0084I9QI2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0084I9QI2 Bad, 25th Anniversary Edition, Deluxe Edition]]I'm a long time fan of Michael Jackson and after his untimely death, I was afraid the rush to make a buck off of his legacy would result in cheesy products. I was WRONG. BAD25 perfectly paid homage to not only a great artist, but a great album as well. My favorite discs are the DVD Wembley concert and the remastered original album. The disc of remixes, not so much, but in all the set is well worth having and enjoying.
0345802934|4.0|The version of 1Q84 that I had didn't make me realise that it was 3 books in one volume; I thought it was one.  I struggle to think where each book would end without making me scream with frustration and wanting more.<br /><br />I can't say I've had a book that's mesmerised me  by simply reading about a woman sitting in a taxi.  From the very opening I was gripped and couldn't wait to find out what happend next.  Each new intricate development of the story of Tengo and Aomame had me gripped, as slowly they started to intertwine.<br /><br />I simply didn't want it to end - I loved it.  If it had tired to tie it all-together into a neat package it would have spoiled the mystery for me.<br /><br />This book makes me want to look into other books by this author!  I wonder why the top review states \\"I am also warning those who have never read Murakami before that that is NOT the novel to start with\\" because I hadn't read anything else by him and I am impressed!<br /><br />The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it could have been a bit shorter and less repetitive.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read.
1936891026|4.0|This book did motivate me to pursue my artistic endeavors more consistently, especially the last few pages. however, I was disappointed to see that the author felt the need to sprinkle profanity here and there to get his point across. Pressfield primarily focuses on our battle with resistance and gives practical information on how to go about conquering this enemy. I just wish he could have resisted the use of vulgar words to accomplish his artistic pursuit.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|LOVE my Kindle app, but the update installed on 10/24/12 ruined the app for me. The app no longer opens on my ZTE Merit. It will sit on the gray \\"Kindle\\" screen and then force close after about 4 seconds. Since I don't have a Kindle, my phone is my reader so this is a bit annoying. Would be a 5-star rating if it would open!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Absolutely awesome! The movie got here exactly when it was supposed to and the movie is one of the best.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a nice game with decent graphics. It creates a wonderful storyline for a hide and find game. Very good.
B0029LHW68|4.0|Fast, energetic Rock and Roll.  It's become almost a defunct genre, great recent examples are getting hard to find.  These guys have it in spades, really the very best at what they do.  Encore!
0345803485|1.0|I am an avid reader however this novel was so poorly written that I struggled to get through it. I finished it but  it took awhile and pushing myself to finish it which is unusual for me.  Yes, the sexual aspect was revealing and exciting at points however, the novel was not something that I would recommend due to the author's poor writing style.
B007CKNX28|4.0|...but not HIS very best (which would be epicly great Raconteurs' \\"Consoler of the Lonely\\" and White Stripes' \\"Elephant\\").  Not so much Jack going off on the guitar, lots of Jack going off on the piano, which, wow!, he does REALLY well!  A very fine original album, looking forward to more of same.  Hey, Jack, you're spoiling us!
0345803485|1.0|I couldn't even finish the first half of the book. Just go read the top reviews, they say it all.<br /><br />Updating... (now I have the time to write)<br /><br />I've been a client in Amazon for more than 6 years, and I'm using my very first review here just because I'm shocked... How come this is a Best Seller?<br />When I started reading this book I had no clue what it was about but the fact that it was everywhere so I wanted to give it a try. The first chapters I couldn't get rid of the feeling that I was reading Twilight all over again, even the breathe-Bella-breathe line was there. Seriously?<br />At this point I got curious about the author so I went to ask my now-it-all friend Wikipedia about her and BINGO, the author used to write fanfictions about Twilight and one of those was lately developed into this book. That explains everything!<br />The level of the writing is also very poor, at first I thought it could be the translation's fault since I was reading it in Spanish but as the book goes on I realize that can't be possible.<br />I always had the discipline of finishing a book even if I don't like it, but it annoys me so much to read something so poorly written that I just had to stop.<br />Again, I recommend you to read the reviews on top, I wish I would have read them before starting the book.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|awesome game.fast paced.cool graphics. great characters and great graphics.could use an easier way to steer /though.excellent job to the creators writers and graphic artists.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I took the kids to see this in the theater. They absolutely loved it. The colors and animation are wonderful. It's a heartfelt, modern family story that takes a look at how we can lose sight of what's important when computer gadgetry takes over society. The clever writing answers all those pesky questions about how Santa gets around the world in one night, keeps track of all the kids' letters, and how the toys are packed into the sleigh. This really brings the magic of Christmas alive. I highly recommend it to kids of all ages who love Christmas.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Hawaiian ukulele player Israel Kamakawiwo'ole was a wonderful talent. You have undoubtedly heard his reworking of 'Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World' in any number of movies or tv shows. Who'd have thought a guy who looks like a Sumo wrestler playing a ukulele could create such beautiful songs? (just joking) This is a collection of beautiful folksy songs... some popular, some traditional, all wonderful to hear.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautifully written and full of mystery, intrigue, suspense, betrayal, love stories, and everything else a great novel should contain.  I was hooked from the first chapter and loved every minute I spent immersed in the secrets.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|George Clooney - in a very intense and meaningful performance - plays Matt King, a man who is forced to raise his two daughters alone and contend with a family legal matter after his wife is severely injured in a boating accident, comatose and unable to recover. King's family - he is Hawaiian descent - has ownership of a large plot of land in Hawaii. The rest of his relatives have gathered together to decide what to do with the land. Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's cousins. But, that's just the sidebar story. The real story is that Matt finds out his wife was having an affair, her lover was the one driving the boat when she had her accident. On his family trip to deal with his legal issue, Matt finds his wife's lover, who happens to be in Hawaii. Then, the story goes on from there. I found The Descendants to be a well acted, well scripted, and well made movie... but a bit slow and uneasy to watch in parts. While the drama is good, the story is not quite fluid and enlivened enough to hold my interest.  This is just my opinion... some may find the movie more enjoyable and worthwhile.
0316228532|1.0|I have to agree with the majority of reviewers here that this book is a big disappointment. While the HP books kept me reading far into the night because I just didn't want to put them down, this book is overpriced, incredibly tedious, overly-detailed (particularly with regard to every imaginable bodily function), and just plain boring that even though I've been reading it for several days on my Kindle, I've managed to slog through only 16% of it! So many characters to keep track of, it's almost like reading a Russian novel. I absolutely love good, witty British comedy, but if this book is supposed to be funny, her sense of humor is totally escaping me. I have a real aversion to not finishing books I start reading, but as another reviewer said, so far I just don't care what ultimately happens to all these characters and probably will eventually just give up on this one. JKR, PLEASE go back to writing your undeniably brilliant and clever fantasy fiction, which have been always worth the price of admission ... unfortunately, this book is NOT.
B00003CX9S|5.0|I have watched this movie countless times, and I am always greatly moved by it. I actually cried the first time I saw it... even after several viewings, I still get misty-eyed.  This is the true story of John Merrick, a horribly disfigured man who became famous as a sideshow freak known as The Elephant Man.  The movie, itself, is as close to the truth as any other Elephant Man story told, with certain exceptions. David Lynch's direction gives it a thoroughly haunting but beautiful atmosphere, though depraved and ugly as some of the story is. Anthony Hopkins gives a brilliant performance as Dr. Frederick Treves, who discovers The Elephant Man and brings him to the hospital for treatment and study. Freddie Jones is superb as the carnival barker who enslaves The Elephant Man and guards his money-making freak. John Gielgud is perfect as the hospital administrator. Anne Bancroft costars as a theatre actress who begins visiting Merrick and becomes his friend. But, the truly outstanding performance of this film is that of John Hurt as John Merrick/The Elephant Man.  He lends a passion and humanity to his character, even from behind several pounds of body and facial prosthetics. The story is absorbing and emotionally charged. The final scene (with Albinoni's Adagio as soundtrack score) is particularly moving... I dare you not to cry. This is a stunning, haunting, unforgettable masterpiece, aptly suited to black and white. No film collection is complete without this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day does a great job with the Dom/sub story line. As much as I enjoyed the FSOG Trilogy, this was sooo much better. Better story line, better written.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|to be honest: i prefer the longer Version of the movie and owned it on US Laserdisc, on US DVD and now on BR.<br />The movie is a great experience and one of the best films basing on a King story.<br />The BR offers a wonderful picture and a very good sound. Kubricks visuals are still worth watching and for me<br />The Shining is an timeless classic.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Brilliant - I am loving it!I am two thirds of the way and don't really want the book to come to an end. When is book 3 due?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is pretty much pike the arcades where iyou are teased and rewarded justvenough to keep you playing.  only two small downsides; the 30 second wait for a coin when you go broke and the offer to buy more coins with real funds.  if you promote a game as Free, it should be completely free, no asking for money.  Still a good time waster.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I saw part of this Masterpiece film on PBS, but wasn't able to watch it all at the time.  I ordered the DVD, and I'm pleased with my purchase.  Its definitely a movie I will enjoy watching again in the future!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|i absolutely loved this book<br />ive been reading these books for years now but this book completely blew my mind<br />for me its rick riordans best book to date,YOU HAVE TO GET IT
B003MC5N28|5.0|When I got an email that Lois Lowry had written a fourth novel for \\"the Giver\\" series, I decided to re-read from the beginning.  I read \\"The Giver\\" first in my early 20s and enjoyed it.  This time, I was enthralled and amazed.  Lowry draws the reader into the story with characters you like and relate to, and she describes a world that seems comfortable and relaxing and wonderful - enough so that you (like her characters) settle in and accept the oddities of this utopian world.<br /><br />We are drawn right along with the protagonist as he begins to learn about what he has never known - how things used to be, both the good and the bad.  Our emotions intensify along with Jonas'.  In the end, we are left with questions not just about the story (what happens ultimately is far from clear) but also about what the \\"right\\" thing to do would be.  I have been thinking about this book since I finished it a couple of weeks ago, which incidentally had me sitting in Panera litterally crying into my latte.<br /><br />The writing is skillful and beautiful, the themes are big and important, and the whole thing is easy enough to read that I'll hand it to my 9-year-old next.  No wonder this got the Newbury medal.  One of the \\"best\\" children's books I have ever read.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|[[ASIN:044024238X The Undomestic Goddess]]  I ran through lots of different emotions reading this book. I've been through a lot of the same emotions and had empathy for the main character.  She goes through a metamorphasis from a single-minded, hard worker with no time for herself, to a person who finally finds herself and creates a new life that feeds her soul.  Beautifully written and entirely enjoyable to read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love the tile games...this is my top five.  challenging and fun.<br />definitely recommend to a friend. hopefully a second version of this game comes out soon!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Loved the movie. Iron man gave good comic relief. My kids and grandkids loved it too. I would recommend this to everyone.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|Very satisfied.  Shipped as described. That is all I have to say and am not pleased with being forced to write more.  In the future I will not review if this policy continues.
0143035711|4.0|I bought Chickenhawk a few months after I read Dipatches by Michaal Herr. Chickenhawk is the complete antithesis to Dispatches. Robert Mason's book is personal journal from his experience in Vietnam from 1965 - 66. It is easy to empathise with Robert Mason as he is an average bloke and does not go in for theatrics or adopt a gung-ho attitude.<br /><br /> If you want to be a helicopter pilot, this book is your wet dream. Mason tries to simplify his training and the way he commands the Huey in Vietnam.  I have noticed that US reviewers in general, praise Chickenhawk as Mason does not go into the politics of the Vietnam War. Furthermore, his account could have been one long crticism of the US military. Mr Mason adopts the human approach and tells his story.<br /><br />Mason fought in the Ia Drang valley but does not glamourise or boast his account. I consider Robert Mason to be a true hero as he was not shot down (a miracle as numerous helicopters were shot down and pilots and air crew killed) as helibourne fighting was still in its infacy when he was in the Air Cav.<br /><br />I consider Mason's account superior to the movie When We Were Soldiers. Why - Mason gives a frightening account of what the batteles were like. The fact that a huey could be shot down by a VC participant weilding an AK-47 must have been the most horrendous feeling. Imagine being trapped behind the controls of huey with NO real protection and even when you are approaching/leaving a \\"hot\\" landing zone (LZ) you are not safe until you gave reached a certain height. I do not begrudge Mason's main complaint that he did not have a chest protector.<br /><br />In fact the good Lord above, his  training and excellent skills are ALL he had. The US for all its technicalsuperority at that time coulkd not even protect these valuable huey pilots. They were easy targets for the VC/NVA as the superior AK-47, 7.62 mmm heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns and RPG's could easily wipe out a huey.<br /><br/>Ia Drang Battle - The US won the battle and lost the propaganda that followed it. Paul Ham the author of Vietnam: The Australian War quotes an ex-VC commander who claims that Ia DRang was a succssful battle for the Communist forces. Why -  up intil Ia Drang the VC were not even sure that an AK-47 could kill a \\"big,blonde beefy American\\", or, could even penetrate a Huey. The aftermath of the Ia Drang battle was that the Communists knew that the US forces were vulnerable. Unfortunately,it gave the VC confidence especially in the South as VC terror attackes increased markedly from 1966-68.<br /><br />The last few chapters of Chickenhwak are sad.It is obvious that Mason is suffereing from trauma, specifically PTSD and there is no solution. The most alarming factor is that US forces in the rear were better equiped i.e. had  chest protectors, night vision scopes, protective clothing etc. Put yourself in Mason;s shoes. You are a  helicopter pilot who visits other combatants who have all the equipment that they desire, in fact surplus, whilst friends in colleagues on the front line are dying, and have died because they did not have a chest protector.<br /><br />Robert Mason is not a whinger or a sook, but rather an articulate man who passed through history, specifically a battle that changed the Vietnam War. If you are into honesty from a true hero then Chickenhawk is a MUST read.<br /><br />FOUR STARS for Chickenhawk.
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|the cover was all messed up but the disc played great! i ordered a good condition, so i guess i got what I wanted.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|well written. great book especially if your into mythology/fantasy. This is a sequel to the Percy Jackson series by riordan, but can also stand alone.
B005LAII8K|2.0|Okay, I'm going to agree with most reviewers that say Loopers isn't that good and some reviewers that say it's pretty good. So, it's just okay for me. It is an action/shoot em' up movie, mix in with Sci-Fi elements.<br /><br />The story gets more interesting as people keep on watching and learning more and more about why the protagonist should try to kill his future self from completing his tasks. The problem is that you have to keep on watching the movie and not get bored with it after some time because I found myself feeling it is dragging and didn't keep my full attention.<br /><br />Once you learn more about the storyline, which the future self wants to kill these little babies because one of these babies will turn out to be a very bad man in the future and will kill many people.<br /><br />This movie is a bag of mysteries - there's no real bad guy or good guy because they're all bad guys! So, you don't really have a straight forward person to root for. Instead you are face to decide who is really doing the right thing. Is it right or wrong to kill someone from the future for future events crimes? Is or wrong for a future self person wanting for his future accomplishments to happen without interference? Or is it right for his past self to try to stop his future self from doing his future accomplishments by changing his present day actions and events? Who is really right here? The future self already lived out his life and has the right to have his life like that, but the present self has the right to make his own choice without any interfering from his future self.<br /><br />This is not a must see movie, but if you like Sci-Fi and like questioning about possible future events happening or not, then this is what you looking for.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I enjoy this movie. Fun music and has a good message for children. Love the characters! Good cute humor. I can watch this more then once and not get sick of it.
B009IQ1HBI|4.0|I can understand how a lot of people that are just discovering Ellie Goulding may not like this album. If you are expecting a lot of radio hits like lights, you may not enjoy it too much. If you are open minded and enjoy listening to a variety of songs that demonstrate what the artist is capable of, you will love it. Equally as good as her first! Ellie Fans, this is worth buying!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I jumped into Wool Omnibus after I finished Wool part 1. I think my favorite parts were parts 4-5.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br />I liked that one of the main characters was a woman who was a mechanics pro (Not the type of heroin you see too often!). It was refreshing!<br /><br />The suspense was good in some parts, especially when Juliette alone, and then with Solo, discovers Silo 17 and what's left inside.<br /><br />The characters didn't feel unidimensional, they were well fleshed out.<br /><br />I'm eager to read more about Silo 17 (and who knows? The other Silos?). I bought the Part 6, which precedes the action in Wool 1-5, and will read it soon :)<br /><br />Many thanx to Hugh Howey for these stories!
B007TK77QE|2.0|A rather disappointing first adult book from JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. A story about unlovable residents in an English village, and what happens when a council member dies, and a replacement is needed to fill the 'casual vacancy'. I loved all the Harry Potter books. And I think JK Rowling should stick to children's literature.
0062202081|5.0|EASY TO USE AND VERY ACCURATE.  I AM A NURSE AND I USE IT IN MY PRACTICE.  IT WAS DELIVERED FAST AND IN PERFECT CONDITION. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS AN EASY WAY TO MONITOR THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A thrilling page turner with lots of twists and turns along the way. A great read and hard to put down.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am very disappointed with the kindle fire version for facebook. Only a few posts display correctly in the feed. When I try to send a private message to someone it just spins and spins and then fails. Horrible app, works for junk.
034580404X|5.0|When I heard about these books from fellow readers, I was excited to order them. Everyone in my workplace was talking about them. I placed my order and waited patiently.<br />When I actually received them I could not contain my excitement.<br />I was so engrossed with the first book, I actually pictured myself as a fly on the wall in each picturesque scene. The book was so hard to put down, it took my two days to finish it. I picked up the second one immediately. You have to have an open mind to read these books. They were amazing. I hope she writes another trilogy soon. She will have to work extra hard to top this one.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this novel.  It drew in the reader quickly and keep your attention throughout.  While it was easy to read, there was also enough depth to make you think and consider.  We used this for our book club and it was a big hit.
0316227706|5.0|I pre ordered this book after seeing some of Seth Casteel's work in National Geographic. I thought I had seen it all when it comes to dogs but I've never seen anything like this! What a fantastic coffee table book too, my guests can never put it down. Finally something fresh and new in photography!
B001TMCF3S|2.0|I love Jane Austen, but am very disappointed in this Kindle edition's quality.  I am finding several typos in every chapter of Pride and Prejudice.  I haven't started the other books yet.<br /><br />Translating \\"chuse\\" into \\"choose\\", \\"shew\\" into \\"show\\", \\"ancle\\" into \\"ankle\\", and \\"stile\\" into \\"style\\" wasn't hard.  Turning \\"riot\\" into \\"not\\" took me longer.  It is as if the text was scanned into an electronic format, but never copy edited. I bought this more expensive version hoping to get the best edition out there.  I think I should have tried one of the $1.99 versions instead.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is the best app ever. I am only eleven and I love it . it is good for people of all ages.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Took about 5 minutes to download.  I was in the same room as my router which could have made it faster that the other people complaining of long downloads. thank God for the hints and skip.  I used. them a lot. my only problem was it would close down on me in the middle of the game and I would have to redoubt the last scene. Very cool ending.  kept me busy for about five hours.
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown's story is one of the best SEAL profiles I've read.  His life - all his roles - are examined with unflinching honesty.  He was a flawed person who found redemption and forged a life of faith, compassion, and unfailing courage. He gave 100%, whether in the role of husband, father, son, brother, friend, or as a brother-in-arms. His charity work in the face of great obstacles and personal risk revealed his great humanity. It is a honor to know a person of his character dedicated his life to protect and defend our ideals. Strongly recommend this book!
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I love this movie,every time I watch it I find something new I like about it. Its got great camera angles and movements, an atmosphere perfect to the storyline and one of the greatest preferences of all time, Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. There's so much to like about this movie I couldn't do it justice with a review, you just have to see it in its glory. Also in my opinion its the best adaptation of the Ed Gein story, beats The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Silence of the Lambs although those are also really good movies in there own respect.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Do it now. If you have and are wondering how the blu ray is, its great, nice features and the picture and sound are great.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Once again Ms. E.L. James leaves us hanging for more. I came to realaize that there have been books that made me wish the story would continue on because i want to see how their life continues on. But this abrupt end makes one feel they have had a door shut in their face.  So i'm thinking...Ms. James must have her own fifty shades<br />.
B0035HKWM6|3.0|Back in the day when this came out I loved it, it was one of the coolest movies because of all the neat CGI. That's kinda changed now since the use of CGI has gotten better. Sure all the gags are nice and all but it just has such a cheesy 90's feel that it's more of a tribute to Tex Avery now. Maybe this has to do with me not being a kid anymore but I still feel it's just not as good as it was back then. The blu ray looks good as it should and I was kinda surprised by how many extras it has.
B008RTE08E|5.0|Long the victim of a bad reputation, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" redeems itself with this release.  Critics have long criticized the film for not being a blockbuster, but it was never meant to be. The new release offers a cleaned-up, brilliant print and soundtrack memorializing the Beatles' whimsical foray into the English countryside first broadcast the day after Christmas, 1967.  That first showing of the Beatles' \\"home movie\\" on little B&W television sets failed to convey the color and energy of the project; enjoying it on a normal TV screen with proper sound -- it's a whole new ball game.<br /><br />Included in this release are a commentary by Paul McCartney, deleted scenes, \\"remixes\\" of some songs, information about the supporting cast, and an interesting \\"making of\\" documentary.  (Did you know those aerial scenes from \\"Flying\\" were leftover footage from \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"?) The film is, in turns, funny, touching and bizarre, but always entertaining.  And let's face it, the music is fabulous.  I highly recommend this, the greatest home movie of all!
B004RDXOUY|4.0|DVD itself was perfectly new and shipped nicely. But What I didn't know was...It was coming from overseas(Thailand). So I had to wait about a month to get it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The author's stated purpose for writing \\"Hunger Games\\" was to show the effects of war and violence on youth who are coming of age. Just an assumption, but my husband and I are not likely to be the only ones who see another theme emerging from this engrossing and intense novel. It clearly portrays the depravity of an unredeemed human condition and even more crystalline is the proof that government is incapable of being the restraining force. In fact, in this novel, it is the driving force.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its got an objective and story line, its much more fun than just a game finding things in a room for no reason! I would recommend this game over others plus its got the &quot;work for it&quot; feel with each level and the gain of experience.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a good game because it has 132 games inside! And I like the way the they use points as money in here!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I forced myself through every page of this trilogy. I have no idea what the hype is about. I've read better smut in teenage novels! Completely and totally ridiculous. Good thing this was fiction. I wouldn't recommend this to someone I hated let alone my friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game. it is so much fun. great for short breaks at work. I love playing it. can be very addictive though.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The creators of this newest form of Sherlock Holmes have done it in such a fresh and subtle way, that the characters mesh seamlessly into the 21st century.<br />What saves this new rendition from schtick is that they never lose sight of the humanity and emotional content of the protagonists. I hope they are able to adapt more of the Sherlock adventures for us to enjoy.
0307743659|5.0|I must stay in the Stanley Hotel....if one night within its walls inspired this horror classic, then it has to be on my bucket list. It haunts and shocks, yet remains somehow within the realm of possibility.  You'll never look down a long corridor, or at a topiary in  the same way again. King takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary.....and it's maddening. You can almost feel the isolation, and your sanity slipping away. A masterpiece of modern horror.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is definitely no Harry Potter.  I found this book very difficult to get in to.  This book has its moments of fantastic writing, but over all a storyline that could not hold my interest.
B007HO392S|4.0|I really liked this album, and would recomend it to somebody else.  Blown Away is the best song on the album and the first time I heard it I was blown Away by it.  Great song.<br /><br />Anne
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Looks great, plays great, and is just flat out fun. Highly recommend. Especially if you have a big pretty screen like the S3.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|For a movie that had such a fantastically eerie trailer, and that held such promise because of its familial connection to the Alien/Aliens saga, Prometheus was a disappointment.  The movie was visually breathtaking, yes, and the cast did deliver, but without a compelling script and purposeful build up of suspense, I can't recommend this one.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you dont have access to oil and a wetstone or grindstone, then this handy little peice is perfect for quick touch-ups on all sorts of knives.  It's tiny enough to fit on a keyring and in a pocket and robust enough for any outdoorsman.  The pull out portion is perfect for serrated parts of the blade and there are 2 different sharpeners for different levels of blade refinement.  All in all, considering the price, it's a perfect accessory for any knife owner.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Wanted a timer that was easier  to set than the stock app. This is, plus it has a great alarm clock. (Note: cannot run multiple timers - just one @ a time)
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|This is a great movie for when I have to put something on that the kids and I can watch together. It is really enjoyable to watch in 3D
1572814349|1.0|There was improper alignment on these cards so they printed incorrectly with parts of the image going off the top of each card. Keep an eye on the return date.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have long awaited the day that I could use an app instead of the web on my kindle fire and I am not disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i think this is a great game ot kill some time with, my only wish is that it were easier to build up coins somehow.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's great! I love the story. I love how she describes everything. I really feel like I'm there with them. Sad that I'm just now getting the books lol. Can't wait to read the next book and I hope they don't screw up the movie.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I love the beauty of the movie. A visual treat. I'm dying for Avatar in 3D but will wait for it in the extended version. The theatrical version doesn't do it for me anymore. So much is explained in the extra 16 minutes.
B0086700CM|5.0|so far no problems on my kindle fire. but of course they want you to buy extras. that's ok. we know that.  great game been wanting to get it so finally did it so much fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book cant wait to  read the next one and then then the next one wish i could read them now
0812993292|5.0|This was such a delightful book!  It somehow reminded me of \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand\\" -- I think anyone who enjoyed that book will also thoroughly enjoy this one.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|The digital download copy wouldn't work for me.  Also, I was expecting a lot more in the special features, kinda disappointed by that but it's still a great movie and considering what you get for the price it was a pretty good deal.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the CD.  The Piano Guys are amazing.  Preordered 2 copies, 1 as a gift.  Arrived on schedule and well worth the wait.  Amazon is our \\"go-to\\" on everything.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|One of those \\"it's so weird if this was a fiction film everyone would say it wasn't believable enough\\" stories.<br /><br />Forgive me if I'm cryptic, but this is one story where you really don't want spoilers.<br /><br />An extremely talented young U.S. singer songwriter in the Bob Dylan mold, calling himself simply 'Rodriguez' released<br />2 LPs in the early 70s. But despite positive critical reaction (and the many songs we hear on the soundtrack are quite<br />good) both LPs bombed, and Rodriguez lost his recording contract, never to record again.  Reportedly he then killed<br />himself on-stage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, somehow in the years after all this, his music caught on among the white liberal anti-apartheid youth of South Africa (where a<br />number of Rodriguez's songs were banned for being too political), and he became an ever growing cult figure, eventually having a huge fan<br />base.<br /><br />But beyond the paltry clues left by his two albums, there's little that his legion of South African fans can find out about their hero. So two<br />South Africans with a deep love for the music start a detective hunt for the real story of what happened to Rodriguez. The film is full of<br />energy, ups and downs, and some clever story telling techniques.<br /><br />Some have argued that the construction is 'manipulative', but I think it's a perfectly valid way to tell a tale. Yes, they could have given<br />us all the answers up front, since they're now known, but by having us go on the journey with our two amateur sleuths, and finding out only<br />what they knew at each moment makes for a much better way to experience the story with them.<br /><br />A unique and wonderful film.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|What a great set of CD's featuring Van Morrison.  I didn't realize what range he has in the different songs on the 3 set of CD's.  One grows up with \\"Moon Dance\\" and then when you listen to these CD's you find he has so much more!
B003YL4KS0|1.0|I found parts of this book disappointing that anything to do with heat styling was bad, with the exception of a diffuser attachment or bowl dryer. It would have been nice for recommendations on how to properly flat iron, and blow dry hair. I don't care for the no comb method that is suggested in this book, however when I adopted finger combing before I comb or brush, and I noticed almost no breakage compared to combing alone. Some hair types are extremely absorbent, and putting a lot of conditioner in the hair can exacerbate a breakage problem.  I also didn't like that all the video's in this book were not compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.  Not everyone has an IPAD device, so make video formats available to the whole audience of people, especially since we all have to pay the same price for this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. I have never had a game app that I have enjoyed this much. It is fun.
0316227706|5.0|The first time I showed these photos to my boyfriend, he laughed so hard he couldn't breathe and tears streamed down his face. That alone is worth the price of the book, but the photography is amazing and skillfully executed. I don't think anyone could regret buying this book. It will make the author's career.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I have to keep uninstalling and redownloading on kindle fire because when new update is available it force closes after each room I go into. This game works better on my phone but used to work better on the kindle fire.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Played then ran out of coins could not play anymore unless I bought more coins with actual cash. Will not buy or play again.
0425263908|4.0|Although Bared to You is influenced by FSoG by ELJ, I prefered this one a lot more. For one rather big reason, this one I actually finished. Another reason was I wasn't irritated by the way Sylvia Day writes, BtY flowed well where as FSoG didn't for me.<br /><br />BtY is one of the books where I didn't love the heroine or the hero but I enjoyed the story happening between them and couldn't put the book down until the end. And even though I got to the end I still want to read the other two in this trilogy/series.<br /><br />Now just because I didn't love Eva or Gideon, that doesn't mean I hated them. Granted if I met Gideon in real life I would high tail it away from him ASAP and hire a personal bodyguard, I don't need or want someone that possessive and intrusive in my life, in a book it's a little different, while it still bugs me I still want Eva with him. Plus Gideon's possessiveness and jealousy is balanced out by Eva's who also is a little too possessive and jealous for my personal tastes.<br /><br />The sex was hot, I loved that both couldn't get enough of each other. I never got bored once while reading them, which can sometimes happen when there are so many.<br /><br />Both characters have their past tramua's and we know for sure about Eva's but Gideon's, so far, has only been alluded to but never outright mentioned, however it's pretty clear what has happened to him in the past. They are both flawed individuals and it's interesting to read the ups and the downs, even if I want to strangle them both.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this one and I can hardly wait to read the next two.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Excellent and thought provoking.  This piece of literature is timeless.  I never had the opportunity to read it in high school like most people and so I purchased it.  So glad I did.  It was a quick read that kept me thinking for days.
0194313433|5.0|I've learned from this book as a student,also my younger sister was using it and now our children are learnig english grammar with this book. Great and easy understanding style, Ana
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was stellar. It was everything he said it would be. The characters were brilliant, as always, and there were more familiar faces (it seems) than there had been in the last two books. Riordan's plot twists and foreshadowing wasn't as clever as it usually is. It was very rushed, and the 4-person point-of-view sometimes made it hard to follow, as well as providing an excess of information. Still, it's my favorite book of his yet and I absolutely can't wait for The House of Hades.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have the first two seasons. As a monk, I used them for our movie of the week, week after week. I love the characters. Maggie Smith is a wonder to behold. Hugh Bonneville is just perfect. I sit here in anticipation of Season 3 in January. The funny little English quirks are so funny and delivered so well. I have already watched it twice and will probably over and over again. Few series have held my interest this way.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great :) you can really get into it easily. It's an easy read, but full of emotion. You will cry and laugh and everything in between.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Unaceptable. I can't cope with a digital edition more expensive then a printed one. As a matter of fact, digital editions should be 30-40% less than paperback.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Is the best game that I play of Rovio. I like so much this game.I play this game every day.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|This video was incredibly slow, which was really frustrating while I was watching it. This also happened when I bought Alien. I don't think I am going to buy another online video product from Amazon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is awesome!  so many creative ideas and its a great way to network with others and share things with one another. I get lost in it everytime I log in.... very addicting!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Get past that first scene where dialogue is ripped from '70s made-for-tv slavery movies and you get a very entertaining action movie.  This is a movie where acting redeems the dialogue.<br /><br />John Murdock is given a few scenes, but it's the supporting cast that makes this movie.<br /><br />Oh, and that's not Booger (Curtis Armstrong); it's Dominic Cooper.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|I bought this not knowing that it was part of Oprah's book club as that might have made me think twice.<br /><br />But I loved this book even though I myself have absolutely no interest in long distance hiking whatsoever. It was beautifully honest and I was genuinely moved to read about her humble beginnings and relationship with her family that is interwoven into the story.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|I watched this as a prelude to seeing (potentially) Taken 2. The Euro-thriller was much more smartly done by the Borne movies. Certain silly coincidences and convenient plot twists made it hard to enjoy this film. After watching it, I decided I'd enjoy re-watching something off my DVD shelf rather than going to Taken 2. So it was good for that.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been working out for 18 years, and have picked up some of the success factors to getting in great shape over the years. However, I never had the entire picture. This is the most clearly written and straight to the point book on working out, whether your goal is to bulk up, or slim down that I have ever read. And one thing that you will also discover is how critical nutrient timing is with respect to the pre-workout meal, post-workout meal, and spacing your other meals out over the course of the day, which for many will be the missing link to take you to the next level. Another thing that I really like is how Michael dispels some of the broscience myths that are repeated and passed on to people when they work out at the gym, with regards to the ideal rep range and how heavy to lift. I just started day one of this program, and am confident that I will be breaking through my plateaus that have left me frustrated. I highly recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When my frirnd told me to get this game, and said it was awesome,  I wasn't  to sure, but after downloaded it it is SUPER fun.  It starts out easy, but then gets harder and harder,  I'm  not saying when it gets harder it is like rocket science, buf it's  still challenging.  GREAT APP,  GET IT NOW!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series just keeps me wanting more! I can't wait to get to the 3rd and final book! She does a great job and knows exactly how to make the reader turn the page!
B000002GXJ|5.0|Just about as good live recordingds as you can get, Hotel California, I Can't Tell You Why, The Long Run, Wasted Time, Take It To The Limit, Life In The Fast Lane and Take It Easy, all fantastic stuff.<br />I really liked Seven Bridges Road, Life's Been Good is OK, only All Night Long is below par.<br />Only one mystery remains, why was it not all on 1 disc as it comes in under 80 mintues?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an awesome way to end the series! I absolutely loved this book and the 2 before it. GREAT READ!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|John's book is a little misleading if you're not careful. Yes, it says How I sold 1 million eBooks in 5 months but it gives the impression that you'll get that with one or two books. John did that with over 20 books that have been growing its following over half a decade. The book has some good information in it - but you have to sit through the Me Me Me Me parts. Also - He talks about fan loyalty but neglects to mention that he padded his reviews to boost his ranking. This is unethical and wrong because you defeat the purpose of what we have reviews in the first place. So - was it useful? Yes! I learned a lot but keep in mind that if you have 20 books out too - it's a numbers game - of course you're going to sell a million ebooks in five months. Oh, and he brags about being the first person on Amazon to get this or that... again, by cheating the system and hiring people to statpad his reviews, thus cutting in front of everyone else to get the maximum exposure. Does he care? No, he's in his mansion laughing at us who are trying to be as lucky. (Don't confuse care about his fans - he does love his fans - I'm talking about caring about what he did was wrong.) Lance Armstrong thought he could get away with it, now look at him. Either way, John is sitting high and mighty and has fans who will wipe away any negative reviews because they are loyal. Good for him.
0553801473|5.0|Really can't understand the negative reviews. The story feels so real, and it just keeps digging deeper and becoming more intricate. I wake up pondering where the next book will take us. This series is utterly enthralling and endlessly original and unpredictable.
B001DAJZI4|1.0|I saw that I could download \\"Tommy\\" and as this was one of my favorite albums as a teen, I purchased it.  It was a two album set and the second album being a group of original songs that were re-recorded. They were not very good. Well after the download, I found I only received the second album and not the original album. After a quick listen, it was not what I was after so i deleted it. I'm still waiting to go back to the sixties.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great little match three game, beautiful graphics! Reminds me a lot of the places I visited last year!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Is this book really self-published?!  If so, then props to you, Hugh Howey, for a fine new addition to the world of science fiction!<br /><br />I read over a hundred books per year on average, and don't give out 5-star ratings like they grow on trees.  5-stars are reserved for books with minimal grammatical errors (no one's perfect!), tightly-woven story, vivid imagery, in-depth characterization, and memorability.  These books score top-marks in all areas!<br /><br />As much fun as I had reading the Wool series, I don't recommend it for everyone.  For sci-fi fans--particularly those who enjoyed \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"--Wool is a more than worthwhile investment of your money and time.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book cleared up a lot of hazy impressions I had of the first world war.  I think Ken Follet is my new historical fiction hero.  I am also a Michner fan and have read all of his books.  Looking forward to getting into the next book.
B0012NVGHU|1.0|We visit Ireland so I wanted videos that include places in Ireland.  I could't get to the scenery because the acting was so boring and story line so slow.  I turned it off and gave  the movie to my son.
B00338QENI|5.0|I learned so much about biology, cells, bioethics, etc.  This is a very good read on a difficult subject.  I loved it.  There was a library discussion also that I really enjoyed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good read.  Liked the twists--lots of surprises and written with humor and gut feeling. I would recommend it to my family members as well as friends who are young at heart.
B00992CF6W|4.0|game is great but,  it needs to be updated all ready! so get on it notch because its here now and its not really that fun any more untill the update
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It's the type of show you can never get enough of. I find myself ranting about how people treat each other and then realize they are not real people after all.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it freezes a lot but I think its great. its also convenient. if it weren't for the freezing and nit working on occasion it would be perfect
B0018OIK0E|1.0|Ok, so I read reviews praising the movie and saw it on a lot of top 10 zombie movies lists.  Being a zombie fanatic, I tried to watch this, with tried as the key word.  Its not a real zombie movie, it is a satire.  AND, the comedy is weak, and not funny.  There were 2 or 3 laughs, but thats it.  This should by no means be on the same list as the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, or 28 days/weeks later films.  Or any REAL zombie movie for that matter.  This Shaun of the dead makes me shake my head and wonder what these critics were thinking, I still do not understand how this is a good movie by any means.  I've seen movies less dumb than this get canned, panned and rideculed, yet, Shaun of the dead gets highly praised by critics and fans alike.  Its not even a funny comedy for stupid comedy films.  I'm a huge fan of comedies that everyone considers stupid and dumb.  This is nothing like those, its just awful.  Did they watch the same movie??  This is the biggest flop IMO in the history of zombie movies.  If you want to see a real zombie movie, do not see this one.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love all of the books that I have read in this series!!! I love the way Reacher talks and the kind of man that he is.  I can't wait for the next book.
B000FC130E|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />That has been the best novel I have read in a long time. Every character managed to leap off the page and play in my brain while I read this novel. The only way that I can think of describing it is to say that it's like Alice in Wonderland written for adults in modern London where there is a London Above which we can all see and a London Below which is secret and goes unseen by everyone in London Above. Richard Mayhew moves from London Above to London Below after he stops to help a woman on the street and it's his search to help the woman answer why her family has been murdered and a way for Richard to get back to London Above.<br /><br />Messrs Croup and Vandermar have to be the best written villains I have ever read and I really wish that at some point (if he hasn't already done so) Gaiman writes a spin-off for these two. Every scene they were involved in was lifted by their presence and I wanted more of them, so much more. Gaiman completely explored the world and I'm not sure if there could ever be a sequel but a novel in the same world would be spectacular.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great way to spend some time doing not much of anything. My students love it as well. I can let them play this one at school, due to the non-violence of it, as well it makes them think a bit.
B00729Z782|5.0|I was extremely delighted by this new discovery. Since prog renaissance in the 80's, an incredible amount of excellent music has been produced to fill this music niche. Once in a while, you find a new band that goes above and beyond the rest, producing not only great music, but music that moves you. In my case in this category I place bands like Genesis, IQ, Pendragon, Marillion (with Fish),Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd, Yes and Dream Theater. I believe DeeExpus is one of these bands. Their compositions are very creative and well balanced. The musical execution is even better, with outstanding Guitar (Two), Keyboards and one the best vocals I have ever heard, same league as David Gilmour and Steve Wilson.<br /><br />Though DeeExpus has clear influences from some of the bands listed above, they have managed to create their own unique style. Their first album Half Way Home is also excellent. If you enjoy Neo-Prog, you will definetely enjoy DeeExpus. This is one the best bands and albums I have ever listened to.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I absolutely loved this movie, and my wife and I were raving about it, and how we were going to tell all our friends about it. Then there was a scene with 2 men falling in love and stuff. Totally inapropriate, and did not fit in with the theme and feel of the movie. It felt like it was just stuck in. We both thought that scene just did not fit with the rest of the wonderfully done musical.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|The entire disc is amazing - even the Flaming Lips rendition of Smoke on the Water grew on me.  But as with any tribute it made me go back to the original album and again realize how amazing that record is.  Still cannot top the original.
B009439E7O|5.0|I started listening to Ill Nino in 2002 i own all there records and love all of them. That being said on to EPIDEMIA this album is very heavy La EPIDEMIA Demi God very brutal! The Depression is my favorite so far its perfect the whole album flows very well. If your a fan of the band you love this album it stands up to Revolution Revolucion. Ill be listening to this for a while.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|Great movie!  One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all times.  Have watched it probably 10 or more times over the years.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I went with the Sony brand and the extra dollars so that my expectations would have a better change of being met. The one thing I missed is that it does not come with the charging cord!<br /><br />So in my case where I was adding a second controller for heads-up play, I still had to make a run to Target to get the charging cord.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great choices of levels, I am not sorry I got this app :) A lot of fun, and i haven't even gotten to all the seasons yet.

B000IJ79WU|2.0|It's been somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty years since the last time I saw the theatrical version of Superman II, but after doing a bit of reading I think I have a pretty strong grasp of the differences between the two films. In some ways the Donner cut is a big improvement, particularly in the way it intertwines the sequel's story with that of the original. Marlon Brando was completely sliced out of the initial release, and while his performance is an egregious display of glum theatrical sleepwalking, his role actually adds several essential wrinkles to the story. General Zod and his envoy are also treated with more awe and respect, granting their eventual staredown with big blue a more stern, serious slant. At the core of its being, though, this remains a thoroughly campy, semi-serious film with a ridiculously nonsensical plot and a pathetic recycled ending that might actually be worse than the reviled \\"amnesia kiss\\" of the original cut. Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve efficiently play their parts, but aren't put in the position to recapture the magic of their date in the original Superman, while Gene Hackman underachieves badly once again as Lex Luthor, this time relegated to a second-fiddle bad guy. A marginal improvement over the horribly-aged initial release, it's packed full of grand logic holes and stiff, contrived moments of peril.
B002UZ5CHO|3.0|The movie exposes the extreme vulnerability of our food to diseases and bacteria.  The bulk of the movie was spent on the beef, pork, poultry industries and only 30 minutes or so was spent on the produce side of food supply, then it was primarily the corn and soy bean industries and how Monsanto has taken control of these markets.<br />I recomend that everyone see this movie and demand a better, safer product from the industry leaders.  I really would have liked to seen more coverage on the vegetables we consume regarding their seed to table life and how they are handled.  Lately there seems to be a lot more contamination issues in the produce industry.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and i would highly recommend it to anyone in sixth grade and above that likes science fiction books.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|i bought this to use in my 2008 VW jetta that has a ipod dock within the center console. i purchased a 30pin female to male connector and that works perfectly for playing back music but i am unable to charge my device while plugged in. so i wanted to get this that way i can use the headphone portion while having the ability to charge with the usb car charger.<br /><br />i have to say i was disappointed to find that the ipod dock in the console did not want to cooperate. i plugged in the 30pin female to 3.5mm adapter and it would not recognize it at all. i even plugged it into my already existing 30pin female to male and it did work BUT briefly. after about 10 seconds it didnt register again and turned off.<br /><br />so i can say that this particular adapter works, just not with the ipod dock in VWs. at least in the 2008 jetta. so i figure my problem sits with that so i will be replacing that connector with a BlitzSafe VW/M-LINK1 V.3A ([...] once i get that installed i will hook up the CableJive dockBoss again and hopefully, and im sure it will, it will work.
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|To be really honest, I am not a Stephen King fan and have never read one of his books.  I abhor horror, hate is not a strong enough word, because they give me nightmares.  After being forced to watch It by my ex-husband, I couldn't take a shower for months afterwards.  I am a great big scaredy-cat.  There, I've admitted it.<br />On Writing, however, is not a horror story.  It was recommended by members of a group I belong to on She Writes.  At first I thought Stephen King = Horror.  Will I take the plunge....yeah.  It was worth it.  On Writing is a great little book.  It is full of useful tips and insights into the mind of one of the most successful writers even if I don't read his books.  I love his writing style and sense of humour.  After reading this, I felt inspired.  Not inspired enough to pick up one of his horror novels, but inspired to work on my own writing.  Recommended for all the writers and would-be writers out there.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved it, more than the first. Finally got some answers, well written, nothing like fifty shades, cant wait for the next.

B001G5ZNEQ|3.0|I purchased this Maiden Voyage Vinyl + CD which sounds like a geat deal, but when I listened to the vinyl after the first time, I found myself listening exclusively to the CD: that's not good. I have an excellent turntable, and I ended up selling my Vinyl (only played twice) for 5 bucks! Then I bought the pressing before (I believe it was 2004), new again from a retail store and it was even worse! I think if you can find the 1985 pressing of this record, you will be much happier with it. It really sucks when you buy a new pressing, never before played, that sounds worse than an album that is 27 years old and has been played plenty of times.Fortunately, the record store gave me a full refund on my second purchase.<br />Please discern any new pressing you buy, and if it doesn't meet your standards, return it. Don't allow these Mega corporations to produce crappy reproductions.<br /><br />Peter Lorenz Artle<br />Musicologist and record collector

B000VXJYFI|3.0|I have so far purchased 2 vinyl pressings (the red one) by Capitol and the first one had blatant sctatches on it.<br />The second one: Side 1 is fine, but side two (played on a very good turntable with new cartridge) sounds horrible! So much snap, crackle, pop yet no marks. Who does Capitol think they are fooling? I paid $17 for this record, and even though Hendrix is great on vinyl, I now prefer to listen to my used CD of \\"The band of gypsies\\" that I bought for three dollars!<br /><br />Please, if you purchase this version, listen carefully, and if it sucks as my two copies did, return it and post something similar to this. Don't let this Mega corporation get away with cheating, and skimping out on vinyl quality!<br /><br />Peter Lorenz Artle<br />Record collector and musicologist
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one hot series, loved the story, the characters, with a hot sultry flow. Wish it kept going! Hope to see another book soon.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I've felt guilty for not reading the Harry Potter books. My child was too old to read to, my grandchildren too far away.  Finally a book for me! \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" was a delight. I understand her huge fan base, her descriptive writing style immediately hooks you in to the story. The characters in the book were so well flushed out I was able to connect with them all quickly. I can't wait for another book from this brilliant author.

B0042UFWES|5.0|I initially looked at this because it was a discounted download. But I am glad I purchased it and would recommend it at regular price for fans of John Lennon. Many of the stripped versions of his songs are interesting to listen to. Less of the studio production on his voice, his voice brought out more, the instruments and effects lowered or dropped, getting a little bit of the chatting before a song was recorded. I played it for an uncle who grew up listening to the Beatles an Lennon, he commented that he thought a few of the stripped tracks not only sounded good, but actually liked a few of them better than the \\"original\\" versions. TYake a listen and judge for yourself.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|I'm sure everybody knows this movie is great.  My problem is that when I was sent the notice that this was coming out the page informed me this was a briefcase version with a Spinner car and other things. But oh, well.  Would have sold that or thrown it away anyway since I'm packing all my discs in CD books for traveling around.
0307719774|4.0|I love this book.  I've been using it throughout 2012 and enjoying making entries.  I keep a similar 5 year journal as well.  My only complaint is that it doesn't lay flat.  I know that's difficult to do on a book like this, but it makes it hard to write in the small spaces.  Other than that, I love it.  This would make a great gift.
0385742886|5.0|I really enjoyed the story. You really get into the characters, rooting for them the whole time, wondering how they are gonna get themselves out of sticky situations, and waiting for those plot twists that dashner is so classic for throwing in there which keep the drama and action fresh. Good read!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|All in and the movie was good, but the ending kind of left you with a lot of questions.  I wish they would of extended the movie to fill us in.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|here comes a time in every readers life when you find THAT book. THAT book that makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you sob and smile. THAT book that is SO very brilliant it surpasses anything and everything you have ever read. THIS, is THAT book.<br /><br />I have successfully made it my 24 years (almost 25 soon, eep) by only crying in 3 books up to this point. The first was when I was in middle school. The book was called A Child Called It: One Child's Courage to Survive by Dave Pelzer . That book ripped my heart out and I've never fully recovered. The second and third books that made me cry were Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover. A beautiful story that also ripped my heart out and slowly pieced it back together.<br /><br />I can now add a fourth.<br /><br />John Green says it best in this quote about Hazel's (the main character) favorite book, which could so easily be used to describe The Fault in Our Stars:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"<br /><br />This man is a mastermind, because although I ended the quote before he finishes that paragraph, that part made me go back to once I was done reading because that was exactly how I felt.<br /><br />Here is the summary of the book:<br /><br />\\"Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.<br /><br />Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning-author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.\\"<br /><br />Let me just tell you how much this story impacted me. I just copied and paste the summary into this post, and I'm already tearing up. Seriously.<br /><br />\\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves\\"<br /><br />So when I was told to read this book, I was told I would cry (no one told me I would be sobbing, I mean, \\"I have the hiccups, can't catch my breath, haven't cried this hard since a grandparent passed away, since I dumped the last jerk\\" SOBBING). So when the book starts out, and I'm laughing, I have to text my best friend Nicole, and ask \\"Why am I laughing?\\"<br /><br />The book starts off with Hazel at a support group for people with cancer, or who is in remission from cancer. And in this support group, she meets Augustus.<br /><br />\\"Look, let me just say it; He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy... well.\\"<br /><br />Yeah. He is hot.<br /><br />So they start forming a bond, a bond of friendship, that later transfers into love. You meet Issac who is Augustus' friend, who also has cancer, and who loses an eye. You follow Augustus and Hazel in their journey to meet Hazel's favorite book's author and site see Amsterdam.<br /><br />\\"The beautiful couple is beautiful\\"<br /><br />WAIT! Did I just end a review with one paragraph about the ACTUAL book and a couple of quotes from it? YES I DID. Why didn't I keep reviewing it?<br /><br />BECAUSE I CAN'T WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE BOOK!!!!<br /><br />Yeah. I know. I stink.<br /><br />So go! Go buy it, go read it.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you to bring tissues when you start it like people told me though.<br /><br />I'm going to tell you to keep a mop handy, maybe even a bucket for all the tears you'll be shedding. I'll also tell you to NOT read this book at work. I hit all the funny parts at work, but I am so glad I didn't hit the sad ones while I was there. I think my co-workers (who are mainly men towards the end of myday) would have been FREAKED OUT by a hysterical woman. That would have been me, the blubbering woman crying about a book.<br /><br />FAVORITE HIGHS WHILE READING:<br /><br />\\"I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen.

Now die.)<br /><br />\\"Okay\\" he said after forever. \\"Maybe okay will be our always\\"<br /><br />\\"My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations\\"day) would have been FREAKED OUT by a hysterical woman.

B009B51K9U|5.0|I must preface this review by saying that I thought 21st Century Breakdown was one of the best rock albums in the past 10 years for me. It caught the frustration and the anger of living in the George W. Bush years, the new age of terrorism and politics. Green Day created an amazing set of songs that both musically and lyrically scored a 10/10. Enough said. Find that here... [[ASIN:B00299EKQK 21st Century Breakdown (Amazon MP3 Exclusive) [Explicit]]]<br /><br />UNO! is something slightly different. It is not political. It is not as angry. It feels younger in a way, which is okay. Maybe Green Day needed a break from being so mad, and maybe so did I.<br /><br />Green Day is not afraid to branch out and experiment thematically. It is the same GreenDay sound... crunchy guitars, catchy melodies, tight drums... but instead of ranting about the government, religion, the state of the nation, they speed through 3 minute blitzes of chasing girls, youth, love and violence (Kill the DJ).<br /><br />This is type of album that gets better the more I listen, though the songs are quite accessible right from the start. My only criticism is that curse words seem to be garbled out... which means I bought the wrong one. I had no idea that there were 2 versions. Dummy me. ha ha<br /><br />When all 3 albums come out, it will be a hell of a musical journey. Give it a listen and buy it.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This album is really excellent and is a good purchase if you like their recent album. I love all of the songs and listen to it all the time.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I am an amateur photographer. I own the D7000 and the D5100 and this flash is perfect for both. I purchased this not only because the flip up flash is weak, but because of being able to angle the flash up to bounce it rather than directly at the subject. You can make all your flash adjustments through the camera. Having a flash that can be angled gives photo's a warm more realistic look rather than that wanted poster look,lol. It's built very solid and love that the batteries can be changed without removing it from the camera.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I am a retired Oncologist.  My training and experience scanned the years from 1964 to 2007.  This book put my experiences into a perspective I have not had before.

This book is a must read for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer.
B0081J95TE|5.0|After 7 years, Garbage makes another great album. If you enjoyed Garbage's music in the past, this certainly won't disappoint. It's everything you expect from them. Solid album, great to listen through the whole way. If your a fan, it's a must buy.

B006UKFFE0|4.0|Ash Maurya presents a step-by-step guide to implement the Lean (Startup) methodology. It's far more down to earth and practical than the most famous Lean Startup by Eric Ries. The latter book introduced thea language to the already existing world of product design-by-experimentation. But it was fairly general and in many ways difficult to apply.<br /><br />Enter \\"Running Lean\\" by Ash Maurya, which precisely describes a process (a procedure even). It tells you what should you do, when to do it, what are the stages in the Lean process and shows some caveats.<br /><br />Perhaps it's even too detailed. Using a very specific examples from a website project it tries to generalize them which may be not applicable in many cases (as the Lean process itself).<br /><br />Being a step-by-step, practical manual this book is also difficult to read. I couldn't consume it in one seating as it's, well... a manual.<br /><br />If you're just looking to learn about Lean Startup movement and method for the sake of knowing, Lean Startup by Eric Ries is a far better read. [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]]<br /><br />All in all, a must-have (as opposed to must-read) for people planning to apply Lean Startup process in their projects. What's important is that it's not overly detailed, concise and practical.

159562015X|2.0|The book, without the test, is worthless.  Purchaser, make sure the book comes with the test.  The description is misleading in that the book was in good condition.

I was not disappointed and I'm giving it to my brother for his birthday.<br /><br />DebtThe1st5kY covers immense ground while only occasionally becoming a little tedious. It covers subjects as varied as the nature and genesis of taxation, coinage and markets (instituted by governments believe it or not), debt and the rise of the veil, the role of debt in the slave trade, interest rates and the moralisation of debt, sweeping right on through to present day financial system woes and wobbles.<br /><br />An excellent, well researched and annotated economic history book by an anthropologist, putting today's crises in clear context. Debt would appear to be a far more fundamental mainstay of economics and business than even cash (never mind barter) - it's all just a question of how we manage it!

0345803485|2.0|I heard soooo much hype about the book.  I love reading but I just COULD NOT get into it.  I just was not a fan of the author's style.  I actually found this book incredibly boring.  The only time it would get interesting was when there was a sex scene.  Erotic is great and all, but there has to be something going on inbetween those moments to hold my attention.  In all honesty I put the book down and have not cared to finish it in over a month.  I got half way through the book and was still bored.  Everyone keeps saying the second book in this trilogy gets better....maybe one day I'll get to it, who knows?  As of now I don't think I'm missing much.  Fifty Shades of Grey is overrated.
0385342063|5.0|Warning!!!!  If you plan to starting reading this but do not have the time to read it from cover to cover in one sitting then beware because you will be dying to get back to it.<br /><br />This book was so well written.  Everything was good about it.  There is nothing bad I can say about it.  There was never a dull moment.  You always wanted to know what did she do now, what is going to happens next, who could have done that, what did he say, she say, etc. etc.<br /><br />The story was so exciting and well written.  The interactions between the characters were so felt by the reader.  The character developement was so good.<br /><br />This book was to me like an old fashioned romatic movie, like you got mail or sleepless in seattle.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I also read Remember me by this author and it was so good as well.  I cannot wait to read more.  For more books I like see my other Amazon reviews and my pinterest page under contemporary romance (red heart) and under w d.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Anyone not liking The Dark Knight Rises doesn't like Batman movies. It was the cream of the crop. Christian Bale was superb reprising his role as Bruce Wayne a.k.a., Batman. For those who didn't see it yet, it encompassed the previous two movies: Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and rolled into a great third movie. I personally saw it 3 times and loved it more each time I saw it. The action and story were great; add Bane and a surprise villian and you made one of the best action features of the year. A must see movie. Can't wait for the DVD release.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Could not believe it. All I did was load app and select print and it printed right away. No set up or need to select printer it found it right away.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|just as good as the dvd music, such a great collection of music<br />would give this item 5 stars, would highly recommedn
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I thought this was one of the best comic book films ever! The plot was well thought out, it was well written and the special effects were astounding! Even at 2 hrs. long I never got bored with this film. If you're not a big comic book fan this movie is still a must see!!!!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|The game was average: you get what you expect. Pretty entertaining, but tiresome at best. It's free--what will you lose?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Intense and very much worth   reading. I recommend the series to anyone who is in to futuristic stories of what could be.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|So great, love the show. It's thrilling and always keeps me on edge. Beautiful Main Character (Charlie Hunnam) Great cast.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I stumbled into this version yesterday, not having seen it before, but having seen it at the Majestic on Broadway in NYC 10 years ago and having seen the (in my humble opinion) terrible version with Gerard Butler once, but loving and listening to the original version with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman enough times to know it by heart. Therefore, I had no expectations which might be why I was blown away by this absolutely spectacular, almost perfect musical version, including the incredibly moving 25-year celebration of Phantom with the tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber at the end. I could write paragraphs about the beauty this music, this version brought into my life over the years, but I want to make it brief because words are just words. This version brought to life The Phanton of the Opera story in a way I had not experienced before. The musical talent was simply excellent. The drama of this story was almost done like a perfect painting. Evoking great emotion as the orchestra, the actors and the stage production came together in perfect harmony. I had my tissues out halfway through the production and in that moment at the end, when the current Phantom bowed before Mr. Crawford, the first and arguably the best of all the Phantoms in humble reverence for beginning the legacy in this emotional and intensely beautiful story, I sat in awe for once that I could find no hubris in the artistic community that often baffles me when they constantly shove garage at us and call it \\"art.\\" All I can say is BRAVO, Mr. Webber! YOU are the reason we, the humble, simple masses who make up the audience continue to pay those high prices to see Phantom of the Opera after all these years. Phantom of the Opera is entertainment at its best. It takes us away on a sad, romantic, gorgeous journey for 2 and a half hours, and in the end, we (at least everyone I know) never feel cheated. This version is the best, and I, who deplore Hollywood's self-glorifying awards, for once felt the glory was rightly given. DO get this version and be prepared for a journey full of aching beauty, intense sadness, and simple good, old-fashioned entertainment. The actors are young, but they bring such fresh energy to this play, their talent so huge, to say they do justice to this wonderful story, is an understatement.  Sarah Brightman, surrounded by past Phantom actors in the final tribute, singing Christine's song is another reason to buy this version. And finally, seeing the current Christine and Phantom, and the original Christine and Phantom surround Andrew Lloyd Webber in the very end, well, that made this the perfect ending to an enduring Broadway play that will most likely go down in history as one of the best plays ever written, produced, and acted by the entertainment community.y was rightly given.

B001TODO54|4.0|4.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />I started working on my YA novel in late 2008.  During all of 2009 I would go to the bookstore with my good wife on date night, strolling the aisles, looking at what was new in young-adult fiction.  I knew where my story was heading - strong female protagonist, set in another world with a medieval feel, fighting, castles and action.  Specifically, I knew that eye color was going to play a big part of the story line.<br /><br />Everything in the bookstores back then was vampires, supernatural, dark...it was all the same.  Then I saw the cover for Graceling and instantly fell in love with it.  The first thought that ran through my mind, \\"That could be the cover to my book!\\"  I just HAD to read it.<br /><br />I instantly fell in love with the world, the characters, and the story.  The idea that there are people that have a Graceling - an advanced skill or special ability - that were identifiable by eye color...very intriguing.<br /><br />The action starts off early and the conflict is explained very well.  We know what Katsa can do, what she wants, what she doesn't want, and inevitably, what she has to do.  The formation of the Council, to me, is a little forced, but necessary for the story moving forward.  Some of the travel scenes in the book, as they move from place to place, get weighed down and take too long.<br /><br />Other than that, the story shines.  I feel like I understand Katsa and can relate to her.  Po is a fantastic character as a male hero/love interest and - I would wager - one of the best in recent YA literature.  Their relationship builds steadily and over time, it's not forced, and the dialogue is wonderful.  One of Cashore's gifts is that she is a wonderful writer and her personality comes out on the page.  She certainly has a unique voice!<br /><br />There are many fight scenes throughout the book and Cashore handles them very well, not overly technical, helping them add to the story.  The side relationships and characters - which are few - are appropriate and add depth to the story without dragging it down.<br /><br />The resolution to the book is also extremely satisfying.  We are not supposed to like Randa, her uncle King, and we don't.  We certainly are not supposed to like the mysterious King Leck, and we don't.  The way Katsa is allowed to overcome her own physical, emotional, and mental obstacles is real.<br /><br />A great story with likable characters who overcome conflict to save the day - that's exactly how a story is supposed to be.  But Cashore's strong voice and ability to bring me into the story, that's what makes this one extra special.acters - which are few - are appropriate and add depth to the story without dragging it down.<br /><br />The resolution to the book is also extremely satisfying.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooooo awesome and fun,its addicting don't listen to the negative comments their jealous because they're not making money the genius who made this awesome game is.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|An interesting story and beginning to a trilogy. The story is told from two view points that are both invite the reader in. There is enough mystery and hidden knowledge to keep you reading till the end with no regard for time.<br /><br />Buy, read and enjoy!
B008QE9XD2|2.0|First and foremost, Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors.  Burton makes the 'dark' shine so brightly in all of his films, which include [[ASIN:B000P0J06K Batman]], [[ASIN:B0000AC8LI Edward Scissorhands: 10th Anniversary]], [[ASIN:0792164903 Sleepy Hollow]], and a personal favorite, [[ASIN:B0013D8LOK Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]].  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's spouse) are often cast in Burton's films and 2012's [[ASIN:B009KHDT0C Dark Shadows]] is no different.  While Depp and Carter are superb as usual in Dark Shadows, it is the film itself that is an ambitious remake that falls short.  To Dark Shadows's credit, there are many good pieces (the ambitious and potential), but those pieces come off as scattered and lacking the same oomph as most Tim Burton films do.  Dark Shadows is funny given its role as a dark comedy, but it is also 'silly,' which makes the laughs a bit temporary and superficial.<br /><br />The plot is as follows: Barnabas Collins (Depp), a member of a family of prominent fishermen/fish marketers, is the protagonist of the story. After his lover jumps to her death after being put under a spell by jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green).  Angelique ultimately curses Barnabas and the Collins family making Barnabas a vampire who is ultimately buried alive.  Two centuries later, Barnabas's coffin is dug up and he is alive in full fledge vampire form.  He returns to his mansion to restore the family fishing business and try to undo Angelique's fishing business, which became the standard after Angelique turns the town against the descendants/remaining Collins family.  Victoria, a non-family members comes to the mansion to serve as a governess for David Collins (Gully McGrath) whose mother was the victim of Angelique's witchcraft.  Barnabas Collins falls for Victoria and ultimately saves her from Angelique's witchcraft.<br /><br />Ultimately, the plot is a bit 'all over the place' much like the overall film. It is scattered and over-ambitious. Writers do well by making the beginning and end of the film connect, but some of the inner plot is questionable.  As stated earlier, there is enough comical moments to make Dark Shadows enjoyable for a while.  However, the ludicrousness and silliness sometimes supersede the comical nature, which ultimately hurts this Tim Burton offering. The ambitious elements furthermore are not enough to carry this film.tered and over-ambitious.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read the book because I liked the ending. But I really wanted to hear it from a Seal, who was online.  It's remarkable what these valiant Americans go through for their country.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Please try this the reviews are true. I can follow along at church and take notes at the same time. Love it!
B00136JS12|5.0|This was easy to download and what a great price. It was such an easy purchase that I will definitely buy more like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app/site is awesome. Very addicting. It's easy to spend several hours on it. Much better than facebook. Once you start using this app you wont be able to stop.

B008J05EL8|1.0|first shell out cash for the app and no they went to charge extra for the fonts package. absolute rip off.
1451696191|5.0|I read a lot. Normally literary fiction. This is one of my favorite reads on a long time and I was sad when it ended. It's an interesting format, (the whole book is written in letters to an unknown person) which I wasn't so sure about at first but ended up loving. Just a very sweet emotional story of a confused teenager abed his friends. Will definitely read this one again some day.
B000000OMB|5.0|The 60s and 70s were filled with great Classic Rock. In the late 70s, songs got longer and more complex.  Classic rock needed an update into the modern era... and along came the answer... the &quot;Supergroup&quot; ASIA's outstanding, groundbreaking, inspiring 1982 debut.  This up-beat, fun, classic, &quot;easy to listen to&quot;, singable, complex album fills your head with great melodies and biting lyrics... simply an awesome album.  Few rock albums remain as relevant and potent today as this powerhouse of classic rock meets progressive rock with a splash of contemporary rock polish.  Each of these highly talented musicians blends their sounds, rhythms, melodies and riffs together in a crisp, clean, powerful progressive song. The nine tracks on this album are each outstanding.  These hall-of-fame musicians are each at the peak of their careers and work together flawlessly. John Wetton (King Crimson, Roxy Music, UK) on vocals is forceful, powerful and almost angry--as the sometimes bitter, always potent singer and lyricist. One of the greatest guitar players in history Steve Howe (the virtuoso who did Roundabout by Yes), mixes multiple guitars and styles with power and finesse.  Drummer Carl Palmer (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer) hammers the drums with a performance worthy of being compared to Neil Peart (Rush). Keyboardist Geoff Downes (Buggles, Yes) brings an up-beat, hip, and warm sound to the album that helped to define a decade of rock. Asia is totally underrated. This was the biggest selling and most compelling album of 1982. Asia and other 80s bands (e.g. Journey, Rush) don't get the real credit they deserve for modernizing classic rock and bringing it to the masses. 25 Years later, Asia &quot;Asia&quot; remains a masterpiece... and the original four members are back on tour performing it front-to-back live on tour.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|The Zac Brown Band are the best band to come out of the South, in years. They won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They are similiar to the early Allman Brothers Band (ABB). The band is full of talented musicians. I have their DVD and I love it. Also, I've seen them live in concert in Bossier City, Louisiana back in February of this year. They are a great live band.<br /><br />This album is an outstanding studio album. It contains a song (\\"Knee Deep\\"), featuring Jimmy Buffet, who is a big influence on the ZBB. Also, it features a song with Alan Jackson from Atlanta (\\"As She's Walking Away\\"). The ZBB band is from Atlanta, Georgia. This album is full of great music from the beginning to the very end. The music on this studio album is very Album Oriented Music. I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|But kind of stupid. The ending is a cop out. MAGIC wolves and other stupid stupid things. But the rest is Okay.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great story, very well written and one I couldn‘t  stop reading. Delete one star because I cried in damn near every chapter and this only permitted me to read the book at home. I love Enzo. I love his love for racing and Denny.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever definetly revoked it to everyone. Once you start playing this you cant stop. This is the way better than block story.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These books just suck you in (oops would that be the right term ha ha ha). Well anyways, even though there is a lot of \\"adult time\\" in these books this particular one is starting to make the this series easier to read. There is starting to be move of a story line in it. A lot of people tell me they think the author does not write good. Well here is my thought, she is a first time writer from what I was told, give her a chance. BUT the thing is we really don't know that she is a bad writer because the way I look at it is she is writing for an imature young lady. She needs to make us feel that this young lady is imature, doesn't know anything about anything. I think she is doing a wonderful job at making me understand this.
B000S9C8M6|5.0|I'd never really cared much for Sirenia. Before this, they were always lacking something to me, but this album has a great energy to it, and I often listen to it straight through. Love it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The only thing I knew about this book before I read it was the movie trailer. I was therefore expecting a whimsical adventure story. What I found was a stark, if still somewhat fantastical, story of survival on the high seas. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought the book was strongest in the parts that were grounded in reality, such as the numerous discussions of animal training or religion. I honestly can't imagine how this book will be adapted into a film, but it is an excellent and gripping read.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of my all-time favorites.  Best work I've seen by Clooney, and the sound track is outstanding.  And it's G rated.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't even recall how I stumbled on Wool 1-5, but thankful for the experience...only to find at the end a terrific prequel (#6 but do read in order!). First time reviewer and cannot wait for the next installment. I'm an Orson Scott Card fanatic and this has an Ender's series run quality...you can't wait for the next installment. Well done...highly recommend!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Extremely well done.  Especially like the interviews with the actual members of Easy Company.  Makes me think of my dad.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Great storyline with believable characters and enough suspense to try to figure out the case<br />Good ending with element of surprise
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game and the many levels.  The game has a lot of options you can use to obtain a new level quickly.  Great game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. You being with the build up of the hunger games, then the suspense of what will happen in the game and finally the aftermath of what the games have done to Katniss. I strongly recommend this read to anyone who likes survival adventure.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Probably the best team superhero movie out there to date. Only thing missing with this purchase is the digital copy.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I wanted to start by listing my biases going into this album.<br /><br />a. I was a little late to the Taylor Swift party, getting her first album for Christmas 2007 and falling super hard for \\"Love Story\\" the next year. Then I have continued to follow her career and her life. We're about the same age and I have a deep fondness for the girl.<br /><br />b. When listening to music, I tend to prefer short, fast songs, which made Speak Now a bit of a trial since there were several songs over 5 minutes long.<br /><br />c. I also tend to focus on lyrics rather than music or vocal performance. I'll be sharing some of my favorite lines below.<br /><br />d. I LOVE pop music-Max Martin is a genius to me so I figured I would really enjoy those elements on this album<br /><br />e. My top 5 most played Taylor songs (so far) are: \\"Love Story,\\" \\"Sparks Fly,\\" \\"You Belong With Me,\\" \\"Ours,\\" and \\"Our Song.\\"<br /><br />1. State of Grace: I'm not saying this is a full-on rock song but I have seen critics classify it as in the rock genre. Although there might be rock enthusiasts who will say it's not rock, I found it to be too much for my poppish sensibilities. So the album didn't open strong to me...plus it's soooo long.<br /><br />2. Red: Much more to my taste; I love the idea of these colors punctuating the moments of their relationship although I wish there had been more than three colors mentioned (just red, blue, and dark gray). I also really love the repeating r-r-r-r-red and the way the music moves during the third chorus (I do not have the vocabulary to describe it properly).<br /><br />3. Treacherous: Although this is a slower song, I actually really like this one. It seems a bit more adult for Taylor (\\"I'll do anything you say if you say it with your hands\\") and I really like the percussive elements.<br /><br />4. I Knew You Were Trouble.: This was my favorite song of the five that were released early. It's fast, catchy, and I love the light dubstep influences.<br /><br />5. All Too Well: A slow 5 min+ song sounds like one I'd hate but this one is another winner for me. All the details that paint a beautiful picture to my word-loving brain. It's so pretty and it also satisfies my gossipy side (this is totally about Jake, right? I mean, maple lattes!) I want to share a few lines too:<br /><br />\\"You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me\\"<br /><br />\\"And maybe we got lost in translation/Maybe I asked for too much/But maybe this thing was a masterpiece/Til you tore it all up\\"<br /><br />\\"So casually cruel in the name of being honest\\"<br /><br />\\"But you keep my old scarf from that very first week/Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\\"<br /><br />6. 22: I'm just about the same age as Taylor and am happy to dance to this song until we turn 23 and then I'll be bitter that she didn't release this earlier. The very beginning makes me think of Pink's \\"Raise Your Glass.\\"<br /><br />7. I Almost Do: This is another slower song and it's not that I don't like it but after \\"Treacherous\\" and \\"All Too Well,\\" it doesn't stand out enough for me.<br /><br />8. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together: I am of two minds about this song. On the one hand, it sounds very high school and no way do I ever want to go back to that time but on the other hand, it's so dang catchy and fun! I easily memorized all the lyrics and love to dance to it.<br /><br />9. Stay Stay Stay: This reminds me of \\"Ours\\" except a bit more upbeat so it's no surprise that I loved this one especially due to the image of the boy in the football helmet.<br /><br />10. The Last Time: A duet with Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol, a band I'm not familiar with (they don't sing pop do they?) It's a great song and very pretty. I feel that it fits well in Swift's oeuvre.<br /><br />11. Holy Ground: I don't have much to say about this song; I don't hate it but it's not a standout to me. It is quite catchy as I realized I was singing it to myself during my lunch break.<br /><br />12. Sad Beautiful Tragic: My least favorite offering on this CD-it's long, slow, and reminds me of my least favorite parts of the album Speak Now. I do really like the line \\"And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me.\\"<br /><br />13. The Lucky One: Another song that left me cold. Perhaps better for Joni Mitchell fans? I also bristle at Taylor telling her she's the lucky one; I think she knows!<br /><br />14. Everything Has Changed: I'm going to steal from my sister since she doesn't follow my online activity: \\"It is too perfect.\\" I checked out Ed Sheeran's music after hearing that Taylor had tweeted about writing with him and I liked it a lot. If you're a fan of him, you'll probably like this song.<br /><br />15. Starlight: The lyric message on this song is \\"For Ethel\\" which immediately brings to mind the Kennedys and Taylor's whole thing with that kid, which is just so weird. If I were always able to separate her life from her music, I would love this song because it's so danceable.<br /><br />16. Begin Again: I like the hopefulness but something about the line \\"And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid\\" doesn't work for me. The rest of the song is great though.<br /><br />After \\"Ours,\\" \\"If This Was a Movie,\\" and \\"Superman\\" on Speak Now were hits for me, I had to make sure to get the deluxe version again hoping for three more winners (I'm ignoring the two demos and acoustic version). This time though, well, two out of three ain't bad.<br /><br />17. The Moment I Knew: This is one of my fave slow songs from Taylor ever. It actually reminds me of the OC New Year's Eve episode-does anyone remember that show? Of course, there Ryan does show up to kiss Marissa while here the guy never shows leaving Taylor to cry in a beautiful song for us even if it's emotionally draining to her.<br /><br />18. Come Back...Be Here: It would be too personal to share the main reason I love this song but love it I do. I love everything but especially the music and lyric at \\"New York...be here/But you're in...London/And I break down,/Cause it's not fair that you're not around.\\" This occurs about a minute from the end and I keep repeating it over and over again.<br /><br />19. Girl At Home: Although ostensibly against cheating, this line gave me pause: \\"And yeah I might go with it,/If I hadn't once been just like her.\\" It sounds like she's only anti-cheating because she's been cheated on-that is not good girl code. But even though this song is short and catchy, it's really repetitive and I find it a bit boring.<br /><br />Cover: One last thing to mention-I saw another reviewer pan the cover and I kind of agree. Fearless and Speak Now were gorgeous covers but this one is very meh to me.<br /><br />If you made it to the end, thanks for reading! Did you get this album? What songs do you like?br /><br />12.

B009VB97EY|3.0|And that is ONLY b/c I like Channing Tatum. Now he is definitely NOT the best actor in the world...but he's nice on the eyes and that makes up for it....KINDA. This movie was just okay. All of the strippers were okay looking but old. Channing is my favorite so Im bias. The storyline was just okay. The acting was just okay. The soundtrack was better than the two. I've seem better strip teasing in commercials. The promos REALLY did a good job in overly hyping up this movie. Definitely overrated. Definitely happy I didn't go to the movies to see it. I'm kinda upset that I spent $3.99 instead of $1 at the Redbox. My mistake.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Had some good action scenes. Dragged a little in some spots. Overall not as good as the previous MIP movies.
0375758992|4.0|Fuller tells one story during a particularly politically charged time in history with an amazing amount of levity and perspective. This makes her a fantastic story teller!
B005V20JKI|5.0|I don't normally write reviews (which makes me a scumbag because I have downloaded the foatd nearly 150 times now) but this game is great. It's a very simple game with a very small learning curve and very cute sharp graphics. I have played this game from start to finish (upgrading every class) four times now because I enjoy playing this game so much. Well worth the money considering how much time I have spent playing it and how much genuine entertainment I get from playing it.

The author goes beyond merely ignoring and dismissing genetics as an explanation for differences between societies, and he in fact repeatedly calls white people \\"racists\\" for any curiosity they might have in genetics.<br /><br />If the author preemptively rejects evidence (genetics) for his hypothesis (differences in civilizations), then his conclusions are incomplete.  Well, they're incomplete at BEST, at worst, he's just  a straight-up fraud.<br /><br />So this deliberate rejection of genetics - and, in fact, the author's routine name-calling of white people as \\"racist\\" - is my biggest problem with the book, by far.  As noted before, it permeates the entire book.  However, it's far from the only problem I had with the book.<br /><br />First off, the writing is regularly boring and dull.  Maybe there was a good reason to have dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of pages devoted to long-forgotten cultures in the South Pacific (of which the author is clearly speculating about a great deal), but I usually couldn't figure out what those reasons were.  Some of the topics and factoids were interesting (for instance, the sparse population of Australian Aboriginals causing their technological development to plateau), but much of it was a mixture of tedious, pointless, or too speculative.<br /><br />Another problem comes from the author's attempt to essentially bully readers into believing everything he says by stating speculations and vague theories as absolute fact and piling one on top of another.  And when the topics are very obscure (dead civilizations in remote areas) and he's carrying on, readers have to defer to his judgment and presume he's an expert.  In fact, when considered seriously, much of his reasoning is just hilariously stupid, but he tries to sneak by with this.  For instance, in one of his anti-white (gentile) diatribes, he declares that whites were inferior horse riders to the Native Americans - this is his way of proving that, even though the Native Americans had few domesticated animals, they could have domesticated large animals if they had had access to more of them.  So, how does he demonstrate that Indians were better horse riders than cowboys?  He references the supposed ideal of a horse-mounted Indian that \\"now figure prominently in white Americans' image of American Indians.\\"  (Pg. 356.)  So now he's referencing Hollywood movie shots to prove his theory.  That's New York Times-approved science, people!<br /><br />On the plus side, the book does have some interesting anecdotes (most especially the well-relayed story of Spanish Conquistadors defeating the Incas - which was largely told through primary sources), many interesting factoids (the vitally important fact that diseases wiped out 90% of the indigenous population on North America when Europeans arrives), and then there are broad concepts that are interesting, as well (such as the east-west geographical axis of Eurasia allowing for greater diffusion of crops and animals because of similar climates along the same longitude).<br /><br />However, those considerable attributes do not even come close to overriding the author's disingenuous and prima facie rejection of genetics as the cause of anything, the long portions ofit that are plain boring, nor the faulty logic in many of the pillars of his various arguments.<br /><br />The fact that the mainstream media praised this book so breathlessly is just more proof that I should continue to give them no credibility.it that are plain boring, nor the faulty logic in many of the pillars of his various arguments.<br /><br />The fact that the mainstream media praised this book so breathlessly is just more proof that I should continue to give them no credibility.

0374214913|5.0|If you live in the San Francisco Bay area or work for Google you'll really like this book.  It just so happens that *I* am the target audience but I suspect there are many that will find the humor quite accessible and will appreciate the craft and talent behind this book.  I must say that I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't any longer but... if that's all it took to tell the story then so be it.  I really liked the ending so no point in trying to extend something that's perfect as is.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a Jack Reacher fan. This book was pretty much anti-Reacher. But it was the most fun I had reading a book in a while. Not a lot of physical action but lot of fun following them figure things out. Reacher may be a little slow as some one said. Nonetheless, he came through like he always does.

1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom hits another one out of the park! The Time Keeper is such a thoughtfully written book. We follow a slice of life of the Time Keeper, a dying rich man and a teenage girl and see how they ultimately intertwine. It is beautifully written, easy to read and you don't want to put it down once you pick it up. How does \\"Time\\" affect you\\"? Read it and see.

1596912863|5.0|Having never read a Shannon Hale novel, I was expecting Austenland to be a fun romp. And it was that! But it was also an arrow that hit close to home. Through the multiple layers of humor and wit (and the wonderful Austen novel parallels, some obvious and some subtle), Hale weaves a story much like my own.<br /><br />You know...when you're a romantic woman who can't have a fling to save her life, and it always looking for The One? Especially if he dressed like Darcy and looked like a wet Colin Firth? I was cringing with familiarity throughout this novel...though laughing aloud while I did it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, lighthearted, romantic comedy, this is a great pick. It'll have you wanting to re-read your Jane Austen novels, dress up in Regency attire, and attend a Pembrook Park of your own. Plus, her wit and sharp humor has a wonderful sort of educated appeal. I will definitely be picking up more Hale books in the future.<br /><br />(Please, please tell me such a thing as Pembrook Park exists in real life because I would work there for free!)
B009GEAPYW|4.0|This movie is both a faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic graphic novel and an achievement in animated filmmaking. Newcomers may find some of the unfamiliar character designs troublesome; particularly with the Mutant gang and their leader. However, fans of the source material will be pleased to discover that the animation is top notch and Miller's designs have not been tampered with. All in all, this is a great standalone Batman movie that fans and non-fans should enjoy.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|I am a bit surprised by all of the ambivalent reviewers on Amazon.  This album is remarkable from start to finish and I'm not finding any dull tracks whatsoever.<br /><br />First, let's get something clear.  Gary Clark Jr. is not a newcomer as some people are suggesting.  He has several self-released albums which for some reason are not available on Amazon but I have in my iTunes library: Worry No More, 110, Gary Clark Jr. and the commercially released Bright Lights EP. Those releases sound like demos compared to 'Blak and Blu' - which offers rich instrumental arrangements and seamlessly unites the classic with the modern.<br /><br />The production is diverse and provides a fusion of so many different influences and genres:  a creature that's part Jimi Hendrix, part Gov't Mule, part Amorica/Three Snakes-era Black Crowes, and a tablespoon of Ben Harper, while interstitially placing songs resonating classic Muddy Waters and even Marvin Gaye (\\"Please Come Home\\" is the modern-day \\"Distant Lover\\").  And his guitar solos?  Please.  He hits each one with such conviction and emotion that you can't but shake your head in amazement.<br /><br />This album is The Truth.  Clark hasn't gone 'commercial'-- for crying out loud several of the tracks are over seven-and-a-half minutes long.  This is an expression of a true Bluesman, and I believe this is a work that will be influential to a new generation of rock musicians.<br /><br />Please, pick up this record and listen through it, and I assure you that you'll be pleased.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Loved this programme it was all it was talked up to be and more! Great suspense, surprises and not predictable at all! Which is very uncommon these days! I personally cannot wait for season two to come out!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Another great Product! Love it. This case is light, it doesn't add weight to the already heavy Kindle Fire. It keeps the dust off and it looks good too. It would have been even better if it stood upright as well. And had a place for the stylus. But I still think it deserves \\"Five Stars.\\" I'm glad I bought it. For the people who are wondering if this fits the new Fire HD I really don't know. I have the first Fire 7\\" LCD WiFi. It weighs 1.3 Lbs. the HD I think weighs 1.7 Lbs. Not sure if it makes a difference.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I liked Mark of Athena because of the action imbedded in the story. This is a great book - you should read it!
B009GEEMLY|2.0|I would reccomend this movies to anyone. If you like action or not, it is a good movie. This is however the second movie we have rented through amazon and the voices and sounds of the movie dont match up. We were constatly turning the volume up and down the whole night. Terrible sound quality from amazon. Good movie.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This video has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years.  I have given it to nieces and nephews and now for my granddaughter.  A relaxing, peaceful story.
1451627297|5.0|I'll keep this short.  I have read many books but this is the first one I felt that I should review.  The only disappointing thing about the book is that there was an ending.  I felt as though I was right there with Jake on his journey.  This is officially one my favorite books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the jack reacher novels, and this one does not disappoint. They keep getting better and better. I couldn't put it down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews on this game!  I am on level 55 and have not had to purchase anything!  It starts out slow but you gain higher coin limits and special bonuses as you gain levels and collect prizes. There is even extra prizes that fit in a puzzle to get even more coins. All free. Give this game a try if you enjoy carnival coin dozers, you will probably like it!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Purchasing this Lego set was a no brainer. Its the only one that features Captain America, So if you truly want to assemble the Avengers. You must buy this set. His bike is a cool addition to an otherwise underwhelming set. The Chitari are at least a bit different from each other, which is better than two identical minifigs.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Altogether just an amazingly well put together movie. Not the most amazing graphics I've ever seen, but it has a good storyline which is great. Perfect mix of seriousness, stupidity, and humor. Probably the best movie I've ever seen, and I really hope they release another. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Let me preface this by saying I fell in love with Old Man's War. I then devoured the second book in this series, The Ghost Brigades, and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't quite as entertaining as the first book. That being said, The Last Colony fell somewhere between the previous two books on my SUBJECTIVE SCALE OF GOOD READS.<br /><br />Without any spoilers, it is a solid book, good characterizations of previously unmet or undeveloped characters, revisiting old and loved characters and it had some creative and entertaining solutions to creative and entertaining problems. The majority of the book is a slow buildup to the last 50 or so pages, which left me grinning the whole way through.<br /><br />There's political intrigue, mystery, pioneering and action. It is not a book to provoke a whole lot of intellectual discussion, but it is entertaining, and when you're done, you're left with a feeling of satisfaction. There was no feeling of the author rushing things, nor dragging out plot points. Unlike so many other novels by sci-fi and fantasy writers out there, there was no rush at the very end to tie things up with a bow. While the book wrapped up the major points, Scalzi left the world he created open to the possibility of exploring other characters in equally compelling situations. And best of all, he left me wanting to explore that universe he created.<br /><br />This book is written with enough of an introduction period that it could stand on its own without anyone needing to read the previous two books, but I highly recommend that you do. Not just because you'd be missing out on some great reads, but because the first two books introduce you to two of the main characters and the second one introduces you to a very important secondary character and sets the stage for The Last Colony.
0891419195|5.0|Eugene B. Sledge, a young man from Mobile, Alabama later to be a Ph.D. college professor, joined the Marines right after Pearl Harbor, and soon found himself engaged, along with thousands of other Marines, in two of the most horrific battles of the Pacific War, first Peleliu, and then Okinawa.<br /><br />The decision to take Peleliu has been debated to this day. Originally considered to be a necessary operation to protect McArthur's flank during the retaking of the Philippines, the battle for Peleliu, begun in September 1944, raged for two months (not the expected four days), and by the time Japanese resistance was crushed in the Urumbrogol Pocket, the Philippine Campaign was well under way. 6,500 Marines were killed or wounded out of 17,500 men, and 3,300 men of the Army's 81st Infantry Division were killed or wounded out of 11,000. The 1st Marine Division (\\"The Old Breed\\") was rendered hors de combat until April of 1945. These were the highest casualties to ratio of any Pacific battle.<br /><br />Almost all the 11,000 Japanese defenders died. 202 civilian Japanese workers were taken prisoner, and 27 Japanese troops remained in hiding, refusing to surrender until 1947.<br /><br />Professor Sledge, (he was euphoniously nicknamed \\"Sledgehammer\\" by his comrades, not for any especial toughness) was an ordinary Marine Private, trained as a mortarman, who found himself ashore on the vast coral rock that was Peleliu. Unlike previous Pacific battles where Japanese troops committed mass suicide while being cut down during insane banzai charges, the Peleliu defenders dug in and picked Marines off one at a time from the caves and rocky defiles of Peleliu's stony but convoluted surface.<br /><br />Professor Sledge wrote WITH THE OLD BREED as a personal reminiscence never intending it for publication, and as such it is an unpolished classic of World War Two literature. Sledge managed to retain an amazing amount of detail in his mind (with the aid of some scribbled notes), a task made even more amazing when a reader considers how emotionally and physically exhausted he had to have been in the midst of combat.<br /><br />A few reminiscences are amusing (he describes a hard-bitten World War I veteran who washed his \\"equipment\\" with an army brush), while others are nakedly sentimental (when he writes of the men he knew who died, it is with the obvious glitter of tears in his eyes), but for the most part, his reminiscences are simply, brutally, honest.<br /><br />WITH THE OLD BREED is an anti-war book, but not because Sledge has an \\"agenda\\". If anything, he honors \\"The Old Breed\\" highly for its storied history. Sledge does not speak of the glory battle or wave the flag. Instead, he tells us that a simple compliment from an experienced combat veteran meant more to him than any medal he could have won. He cannot say enough about the bravery and sacrifice of the men who fought and who were wounded and who died doing a necessary (if distasteful) task in a hellish place.<br /><br />I doubt there is anyone who can read WITH THE OLD BREED without being somehow changed.<br /><br />Sledge brings us right into the forefront of battle, where the stench of bloated, gaseous, and bursting corpses is in competition with the noisome exhalation of human excrement, the foul odor of discarded rotting rations, the coppery smell of drying blood, and the stink of cordite. Huge land crabs scuttle amongst the dead eating their eyes, and huge green bottle flies---so glutted they will not move---fester on wounds, and rise up from maggot-ridden torn dead flesh to infest the men's food supplies.<br /><br />The Marines trapped in the midst of this netherworld are reduced to eating nothing but cold fly-infested K rations and drinking oil-tainted water; they live for weeks on end covered in layers of coral dust baked shell-like by drenching rainstorms and prodigious heat over 100*. And they must contend with an implacable Japanese soldiery, given to committing atrocities indiscriminately upon the living and the dead. Sledge writes of the horrifyingly atavistic night sounds of Marines in foxholes engaged in grappling knife combat with Japanese infiltrators. He makes no bones about it. He hates his Japanese enemies and takes a grim satisfaction in their deaths.<br /><br />The Battle of Okinawa, while less otherworldly than Peleliu, was a battle fought upon Japanese home territory, and, if anything, the enemy was even more implacable there, having to be driven out of its redoubts man by man. Sledge tells us of the endless cacophony of Okinawa, of machine guns rattling endlessly, bombs dropping, shells bursting, men screaming in pain or fear or rage.<br /><br />Unlike blazing, rocky Peleliu, Okinawa was a world of mud and chill rains, a world where Marine progress was measured in feet per day, a world of death, where a man digging a foxhole might uncover a mud-buried corpse being greedily devoured by insects. Sledge tells of of his daily post overlooking a foxhole wherein a slain Marine's body, unable to be buried in the midst of the battle, slowly decomposed before his eyes, and how this ghastly sight has never left him.<br /><br />Of 183,000 Allied troops committed on Okinawa, over 84,000 were killed or wounded. Japanese losses were over 110,000 of 120,000, mostly killed.<br /><br />Somehow, amidst all the killing, Sledge (and most of his fellows) avoided going mad or being reduced to human wreckage. Sledge was not only one of the few of The Old Breed who survived both battles, he survived miraculously  unscathed physically. There is no question in Sledge's mind that the war he fought was a \\"good war.\\" But he questions the human toll of any war.<br /><br />So would anyone who reads WITH THE OLD BREED. War may in fact be a necessary evil at times, but if it is, it must be the last of all possible options. Because, in the end, despite the banners and the speeches, only the flies benefit.discriminately upon the living and the dead.

0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen's ability to pull me into the world of the SEALs was remarkable.  I appreciated how he managed to provide wonderful, exciting descriptions of action scenes and maintain a mostly neutral sense of political neutrality.  This book wasn't about politics, it was about the time, effort and training the SEALs sacrifice for each of us as Americans (which is much more interesting!).
B009WJX10G|2.0|I am a bit disappointed with this episode.  It wasn't bad, but I am no fan of found footage films, for one, and for another, this was pretty much a straight rip off of \\"Chronicle\\" -- nerdy, socially ill-adjusted kid gets superhuman powers, and soon becomes an amoral monster, all while filming it.  I love this series; at its best, it's great.  But greatness is seldom achieved by copying others, and that's what they did here.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|I loved the Bright Lights EP and this has some good stuff, but... it also has some really awful pop/soul wannabe crap.<br /><br />I so loathe so many of these tunes that I created an alternative folder called 'Blak And Blu - excerpt' with these tracks deleted:<br />Blak and Blu, The Life, Please Come Home, Things Are Changin, You Saved Me, Breakdown, Soul<br />(the deluxe version bonuses are worthless, and yes, so is the title track).<br /><br />I don't think he's decided what kind of artist he wants to be yet.<br />Third Stone From The Sun is my favorite and he's got the potential [maybe] to walk in Jimi's shoes.  But not with this uneven effort.

Jewel  made a  forgettable  pop  album  and  so  has  Swift.  songwriting is  weak  and  the  production  and  songs do  nothing  for  her  voice. she  is already  overrated  to  me  and  this  album  keeps  that  sentiment  in full  effect.

1401324649|5.0|In his first novel, Jonas Jonasson has created a very entertaining adventure revolving around some of the major international events of the 20th century, many involving espionage and awesome mayhem. The centenarian hero is Allan Karlsson, a Swede born on May 2, 1905 to a suffragette and a social activist who died a pointless death defending a patch of ground he called The Real Russia. Allan became a \\"miserably paid errand boy\\" at Nitroglycerin Ltd.'s factory, where his canny ability to overhear, understand what he heard and be in the right place at the right time would serve him well. After he was orphaned at 15, he began Karlsson Dynamite Company, and his experiments and expertise with explosives would rock the world for the next 85 years.<br /><br />On May 2, 2005, Allan's 100th birthday, the Mayor of Malmköping, the director of the Old Folks' home, and other old people are waiting in the next room to celebrate his longevity. Allan opens the ground-floor window of his room, steps out into a flowerbed and begins his shuffle toward freedom. He is wearing his pee-slippers and has only a bit of money, but he heads for the bus station. A rude young man with Never Again stitched on his jacket asks Allan to guard a huge gray suitcase, but his bus comes while the young man is in the bathroom and Allan chooses to board the bus with the suitcase --- \\"a decision that said `yes' to life.\\"<br /><br />The inevitable chase by the rude young man and other Never Again cohorts to reclaim the gray suitcase with 50 million worth of crown notes lasts for a few weeks. Karlsson's escape entourage includes a ne'er-do-well cheat, a foul-mouthed redhead, a hot dog vendor, a four-and-a-half-ton Asian elephant, and a dog named Buster.<br /><br />The pursuit chapters are balanced with chronicles of Allan's chaotic life, each of them highly implausible but oddly possible. In the chapter 1939-1945, for instance, he is a subservient waiter at the Los Alamos laboratory and listens to the despairof the scientists on controlling a nuclear reaction after their success in achieving it. He is a voracious reader in the world of explosives, studies extensively and solves the problem. While pouring coffee in Robert Oppenheimer's cup, the solution just slips out: \\"Well, if you divide the uranium into two equal parts and slap them together only when it is time, then they'll explode when you want them to.\\"<br /><br />The scientists quickly see the sense in his solution, and they are celebrating success when Harry S. Truman walks in, unannounced as usual. He praises the good news, invites Allan for a bite to eat, and shares two bottles of tequila with him. At the conclusion of a convivial evening, they are interrupted by the news that President Roosevelt is dead. Allan's friendship with Harry endures and surfaces again in other chapters, with Harry once helping Allan obtain a valid Swedish passport in the early morning hours. Possible? Well, yes.<br /><br />Allan and Herbert Einstein (Albert's idiotic half-brother, unknown to the world) are sentenced to 30 years in a labor camp in Vladivostok, but after five years, Allan decides he needs a drink. To get that drink, he must escape. And to escape he needs \\"Soviet uniforms, and then a car, which would need keys in the ignition and a full fuel tank, plus no owner...then the guarded gates would have to open...and nobody would follow them.\\" The implausible plan works; this success leads to another, and another, and he eventually becomes the aide-decamp at the Indonesian Embassy in Paris.<br /><br />There is little physical description of Allan: his \\"hefty fist\\" swallowing Kim Jong II's hand and his appearance as the Wild Man of Borneo after not shaving for 15 years. It is up to the reader to create the whole character as the innate likability, philosophical honesty and genuine attachment to living fully are seen.<br /><br />Jonasson's book might be best enjoyed across the sofa from another reader, over the course of several days, with an ongoing discussion about the Vietnam War demonstrations, Stalin's moustache, Mao Tse-tung's third wife, or the ineptitude of local authorities. Add a bottle of excellent vodka.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jane Krebs

0399157565|5.0|A woman has vanished while digging a dinosaur bone bed in the remote wilderness of Canada. Somehow, the only evidence has made its way to the inbox of Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, over 2,000 miles away in Boston. Despite all of her connections, including her \\"special reservist status with the Department of Defense,\\" it is up to her to find the answers that might be hidden in the ear she has gotten. She has no idea why.<br /><br />When Scarpetta and the team get to the Canadian site, a woman's body is tied up with a giant leather back turtle, an endangered species. She has to get to the body without hurting the animal. No easy feat under the circumstances: the turtle and woman are tied up in rope that is attached to a fender of some sort. But as events unfold with alarming speed, Scarpetta begins to suspect that the paleontologist's disappearance is connected to a series of crimes much closer to home: a gruesome murder, possibly even more than one, inexplicable tortures, and trace evidence from the last living creatures of the dinosaur age, a giant Turtle.<br /><br />At home, when she turns to those around her, Scarpetta finds that danger, betrayal and suspicion have penetrated even her closest circles. Her niece Lucy speaks in riddles. Her lead investigator, Pete Marino, is suddenly too quiet, a definitely unusual state for him. And her husband, FBI profiler Benton Wesley, is not being completely honest with her. But the indefatigable Scarpetta moves on with her close examination of the clues she has and looks at everything within her view.<br /><br />In addition to all that is going on, trying to find or retrieve the bodies of other women, Scarpetta is dealing with another person who acts like a thorn in her face. This female FBI agent is jealous of Scarpetta for many reasons, not the least of which is Benton. Douglas Burke is in Scarpetta's face as often as she can be. She would love to show Scarpetta up or ruin anything she is working on just to make a fool out of her. Scarpetta is aware of \\"Live feeds from headquarters, [she thinks]. Search engines chugging through the news and downloading it to Burke so she can ambush [her] while she's got the chance.\\" But as usual, Scarpetta is above it all and remains stoic regardless of the antics Burke may play out.<br /><br />Once it is established that at least three women are missing or dead, the focus turns to a local man who did handy work for people in the neighborhood. When the group goes to his house, they find him dead at the bottom of the concrete basement steps. But his wounds do not speak to a fall; he was probably dead before hitting the floor. What was his involvement with the women that would lead to his death beyond fixing little things for them? The team ponders this as they trudge through the investigation.<br /><br />As the narrative unfolds, we learn that real trouble bubbles hotly between Scarpetta and Benton. She tries to talk to him and he tries to respond, but circumstances and people keep getting in the way. One of those people is Marino. Years ago, in a drunken state, he attacked Scarpetta and tried to rape her. She says he did not go that far, but Benton will never forgive him. \\"Marino's been framed: if nothing else he's been discredited, been humiliated by [the killer]. He's managed to make his...position much worse because of his rude defensive behavior...acting like a defiant, uncooperative total jerk.\\" This conversation takes place between Scarpetta and her husband as she drives them to another site. She is also aware that much of what Benton is saying is really directed at her: he saw her in the autopsy room not moving away or rebuffing one of the males on the autopsy team. He is jealous and furious. She is embarrassed and feels \\"caught in the act,\\" even though nothing happened.<br /><br />THE BONE BED is one of the best books that Patricia Cornwell has written. She certainly offers readers a large dose of suspense and mystery. The end comes asa surprise after counting clues and profiling the cast. Cornwell defines her genre and offers a stellar novel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum

0446580848|5.0|In the years since the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an airplane over fields in Pennsylvania, Americans have come to hear the name al Qaeda; learned more than they ever wanted to know about Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and a fairly obscure country called Yemen; and become familiar with words like jihad. Even before that, in 2000, the USS Cole was attacked in Aden Harbor during a routine refueling, costing 17 sailors their lives and leaving more than three dozen others injured.<br /><br />John Corey, formerly of the NYPD, now works with the Anti-Terrorism Task Force, along with his wife, Kate Mayfield, of the FBI. They are offered a new assignment, this one in Yemen. Few people would jump at the chance to go into such remarkably dangerous territory, and John and Kate are no different. But the reward would be their continued service in the city of their choice (New York) and an opportunity to avoid relocation for Kate. The bigger reward is the capture (or otherwise) of a leading terrorist, Bulus al-Darwish, aka The Panther. Al-Darwish is particularly hated because he is American-born, from Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The downside is that John and Kate are two names on al Qaeda's kill list. They achieved that honor by killing The Lion, another odious assassin from the Middle East.<br /><br />The plan is simple. Well, not really, because the CIA is in charge and they overthink everything. But John and Kate will only need to commit to one year's service in Yemen to carry out their mission. That could be considerably shortened, though. The quicker, the better; they come home when The Panther is neutralized. And there is a team awaiting them in Yemen to help them succeed. Well, maybe not all of them are strictly rooting for the Coreys' success.<br /><br />\\"...this was the Middle East. The land of the mirage, the shimmering pond in the sand that drew you farther into the deadly desert, and when you arrived at the lifesaving water, it disappeared, and you discovered the bones of those who'd been there before you. You discovered death.\\"<br /><br />They are assured that they are perfect for this job, but realize early on that \\"perfect for the job\\" means they will be a lure for the al Qaeda killers. Bait, in other words. In addition to wondering what their own people are keeping from them, they have to worry about the Yemeni police, who may or may not be on their side --- depending on how they feel on a certain day, or whether they have changed their minds about their previously expressed position. And if the people weren't impediment enough, there's the forbidding terrain to consider. Hot, dusty, parched and full of many places for a great ambush, which happens frequently. Besides, everyone carries a gun, so who can tell the good guys from the bad? As you might guess, little goes according to plan. Still...<br /><br />With Nelson DeMille's wicked wit, THE PANTHER ticks all the boxes of another bestseller. The characters are razor sharp, true to life, scary, amoral and occasionally naïve. And endlessly entertaining. But there is no stopping John Corey once he sets his sights on a goal. He may get hurt in the process, but even death doesn't deter him. As he says, he and the other people who go out to do this job are following a calling. They know it's dangerous, often deadly, but that just doesn't matter. A huge bonus is that DeMille's readers get the benefit of a highly enjoyable geography lesson with a side of history to boot.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kate Ayers

B007THA4FI|3.0|This was a hard book to finish.  I kept waiting for something to happen and waited and waited and waited.  I was tempted to just stop but I hate to do that 'cause then I would wonder if something really did happen.  Also, because it was written by J.K., I had faith that it couldn't be as plodding as it seemed and that soon she would wind it all up into something.  Didn't happen for me at all.  I really couldn't identify with any of the characters or even sympathize with them.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|When I first went to look at this book, there were some mixed reviews.  Some were complaining that only the first 2 chapters had all of the meat and the rest of the book was filler... but what I found was the first couple of chapters set the scientific stage for the process of cue-routine-reward and how it works in the brain.  The rest of the book went through a series of examples that were both within organizations and people as to the processing of habits.<br /><br />I felt that I walked away from this book with so much knowledge and insight into both my own personal habits but also how to identify organizational routines that either make organizations successful or failures.<br /><br />This was a great book... I would recommend to anyone to read this to learn more.

0142419400|3.0|I have held out on reading this book for some time, I don't know why as it seems like everyone I know in the book world loved it. Still I let it set on my shelf as I had a ton of other books to read, but I am glad that I finally did get to it, but there was things about it I wasn't to keen on as well.<br /><br />I totally felt sorry for Anna, he senior year and she gets transplanted into a whole different culture. Yes, it's Paris, France! Still that doesn't mean much when you are seventeen years old and can't speak the language. I would have been just like her stuck in her room with nothing to do being to afraid to go out.<br /><br />Though with some cool new friends she came out of her shell and learned to get around town a little on her own. Etienne St. Clair is this hunk that is also one of her friends, but she has a major crush on him. So does just about all the girls at the school including her one of the girls that has befriended her, Meredith. St. Clair has a girl friend who has already graduated from their school, though he seems to spend a lot of time with Anna. He is the first one to take her out on the town, he goes with her to the movies.<br /><br />Anna puts away her crush and becomes best friends with St. Clair, though at some point things start to change as the school year goes by, but he still has a girlfriend. So what else can you do but make the best of living in Paris.<br /><br />A part of me liked St. Clair and a part of me want to smack him. I think that was one of the reasons I didn't give this book a higher rating. If he knew that he was starting to have feelings for another girl then why did he drag out his relationship with Ellie? That bothered me a lot. I understand him saying he didn't like being alone but he was never really alone because he hung out a lot with Anna and his friend Josh, so it didn't really wash with me. I know he has had a lot of parental problems that probably messed with his head but still it just bothered me. I felt sorry for Ellie. I also felt sorry for Anna because she would get her hopes up then crushed, up then crushed. It just bothered me..I think I mentioned that. :)<br /><br />I am glad the end, ended the way it did, but I  think it could have ended a few sections earlier. I  kept thinking it was about to end, then boom something would happen and drag it out some more, then you think well this is a good place to end and boom something would happen and it got to where I was like..come on just give me an ending. So even though I really did enjoy the novel I just didn't love it as much as a lot of other book lovers did.<br /><br />If you like YA chick lit then I would recommend you give it a try because it really had some totally sweet moments and it's likable.rry for Ellie.

B008SOS63S|5.0|Back in June of this year, I was channel surfing and stumbled over Joe's concert being aired on PBS. My wife and I were totally mesmerized inside of 5 minutes. Joe Bonamassa is, without any doubt, the greatest guitar player I have ever seen or heard in my life! We found out in June that he is coming here to Tallahassee in December, and called to get tickets.  SOLD OUT!, so other people down here definately know about Joe. We did get premier tickets which include meet and greet the band after the show, and I have been counting the days till December.  I now have about 6 of Joe's albums, and have been playing them to death. This is the perfect compliment to the DVD of the concert, and along with his other 2 live albums, gives a great sense of just how talented this man is.  In my opinion, there is no greater guitar maestro out there.  Why the airwaves have not picked up on this New York genius is totally beyond me. Put this in your car CD player, and get the DVD for your home player. You will quickly find out exactly what I'm talking about.  Enjoy!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent second book...wasn't aware there was a third in the series so disappointed to be in suspense. Cannot wait for Entwined With You!
1451695195|5.0|As someone who has experienced an NDE, and struggled with many of the same things that Eben discusses here, I am not surprised at the response that many are having to this book. To say \\"people who have NDE experiences often find the telling of their story, while trying to impart the information they receive during their experience, a difficult task,\\" would be an understatement as vast as the universe.<br /><br />The clinical aspects of Dr. Alexander's experience are what make this story unique, along with his outright conversion from a \\"Scientific Reductionist\\" to someone who sees clearly that consciousness and the vast majority of \\"what is,\\" are found outside of our space/time universe and current medical or science books.<br /><br />To get the most out of any book on NDEs, and especially one that intertwines a very personal journey to find family and self, you must start with an open mind and heart. Unfortunately, those who have already hardened their views on both sides of the spectrums of Science and Religion, will dismiss much of what anyone writes on this topic, because it doesn't fit their narrow, dogmatic view of the world.<br /><br />Even worse, it forces them to look outside of their safe little boxes, and take the effort to learn, while being open to the possibility that current models of both science and faith are a good starting point, but not the ENTIRE answer.<br /><br />Einstein's quote at the beginning of the chapter \\"A Final Dilemma\\" says it best...<br />\\"I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.\\"<br /><br />Whether you begin as a Christian, a Buddhist, Quantum Physicist or a simple seeker of knowledge beyond current understanding, moving outside of the constructs of your current ways of thinking is imperative to discovery.<br /><br />Fundamentalism, whether it be religious or scientific, is really no different than intellectual bigotry, closed to expanded thoughts, or encompassing new ways of looking for expanded information. Eben's book embraces both worlds, and does so gracefully, without discounting any specific ideology.<br /><br />Eben's experience was certainly deeper, and far more expansive than most I have read (including my own NDE). I do agree that the lack of detail about his time in \\"heaven\\" (a term that I find limiting) is frustrating to a point. And yet, the need to spend much of this book on the technical side of his coma, his quest and victory regarding his family (past and present), as well as touching on the scientific aspects of the current science regarding external consciousness, make this short book an excellent jumping-off point for deeper study and discussion.<br /><br />And there's the rub...<br /><br />After experiencing my own NDE (in 1996), I spent almost two obsessive years trying in vain to \\"connect the dots of knowledge imparted to me,\\" before putting it all back \\"in a box\\" so that I could get on with living my life. Through a series of events over the past two years, I find myself very much back into \\"telling the story.\\" I now realize that no book, video, or movie is able to even scratch the surface of answering the great questions of life after death, consciousness, and how they all relate to quantum theory. Expecting \\"the answers\\" from a book of this size and configuration is naïve and lazy at best.<br /><br />There is a reason that the section in this book called \\"Reading List\\" is expansive. Much has been written on this topic from both the spiritual and scientific approach. If you are a true seeker of the truth, you will not start or end your journey for knowledge with Eben's book. Instead, you will appreciate the facts of his experience, the unique medical reality of his coma, and the amazing revelations about family, love and the eternal nature of consciousness, as the BEGINNING of the journey to true understanding.<br /><br />While this book in not an expansive, all-inclusive answer to the melding of Science and Religion, I give it 5 stars for being an important, unique story, bringing focus to the need for a global change in the perception and understanding of reality, consciousness and the interconnectedness of everything in creation.rs for being an important, unique story, bringing focus to the need for a global change in the perception and understanding of reality, consciousness and the interconnectedness of everything in creation.

0802473156|4.0|I resisted buying this book from a long time, even though it came highly recommended by many people I knew on an online forum about dating and relationships.  The title just sounded very gimmicky to me and I was curious what it could really tell me that I didn't already know.  The answer was, a lot.  The basic premise of the book is that there are multiple ways you can show someone you love and care and that different people find different approaches more satisfying and meaningful.  It's one of those things that sounds common sense once you read the book but admittedly I hadn't picked up on before.  This book helped me figure out what my love language was and it explained a lot for me.  For instance, there were past relationships in which I felt my partner was doing a lot of things that showed they loved me but part of me still felt unsatisfied, this book helped me realize it was because while these gestures were nice, they weren't in my love language.  Going forward I feel like I am much better at being able to articulate how I need to be loved and to also feel out how future partners may prefer to be loved.  Much of the language in the book is rooted in marriage, but as a single person I think the advice is universal enough that even single people can take something out of it.  Yes, there are TONS of self help relationship books out there, but this one, in my opinion, is actually sound and helpful

Overall, the joystick works well, however it requires a lot of tweaking, and modifying of the settings, and it began to feel more like a chore than a \\"joy\\". In the end I found that a mouse and keyboard was more accurate when flying helicopters, however it is a lot of fun with jets, and it also works for Battlefield 3! I recommend this for people looking for a slightly advanced joystick, but not wanting to pay $100's. I can imagine it performs well in flight simulators, and it is very well built.

0316228532|2.0|The Harry Potter series was a once in a lifetime experience, one that will probably continue as long as there are children who continually reach the age where they can read a book of that size, and as long as there are adults who realize they never experienced it.  I had to buy 3 copies of each of the 7 books in that series, one for each of my children, because they couldn't wait to dive back into the magic they knew they were about to experience.  After the first book came out, the remaining six found me camped out in a lawn chair and a sleeping bag with my kids waiting for Target to open their doors so we could race inside and grab the next installment.  Even as an adult these books blew me away with the depth and unfathomable imagination that Ms. Rowling possesses.  Which is why, when I heard she had authored a book for grown-ups, I absolutely could not wait.  I was now going to be able to experience the can't-put-it-down ride that children across the world had been enjoying for years.  I'm telling you all this because this fierce expectation I had for an adult version of Ms. Rowling's talent may be part of the reason why I was so disappointed with The Casual Vacancy.  Or at least that's what I told myself as I was trying to come up with a reason to keep reading.  Certainly, I thought, it had to get better.  But sadly, it did not.  The first impression I had of The Casual Vacancy was that it seemed to be a poor imitation of Mauve Binchey's classic style, a collection of different characters that eventually came together at the end of an intricate but interesting story.  Unfortunately, the difference between these two authors is that Ms. Binchey's characters were fascinating, fun to get to know (even if they were evil) and her stories were often punctuated with a dry and unexpected sense of humor.  Totally delightful.  The characters in The Casual Vacancy were never really described in depth, possibly because by page 112 there were already 27 main characters.  I spent so much time flipping back and forth trying to remember who everyone was, who they were related to, and what their emotional handicap was, that I finally created a cheat-sheet of names.  However, by that point, I realized I had already lost interest in the entire book.  If you're a fast reader and can get through this novel fairly quickly I say go for it, if for no other reason than to see what Ms. Rowling has created.  But I highly recommend that as you start reading, you stick a post-it at the front of the book and jot down a brief description of each character as they are introduced, or feel free to print off a copy of what I typed up for my daughter, which I added as a hidden document entitled \\"Roadmap\\" on my webpage.  I pray that Ms. Rowling's feelings aren't hurt by the reviews this book has received, she is so obviously a kind and sensitive person, and so incredibly gifted.  And I truly hope she publishes another adult novel because I still adore her as a writer and a storyteller and would be the first in line to buy a copy.pent so much time flipping back and forth trying to remember who everyone was, who they were related to, and what their emotional handicap was, that I finally created a cheat-sheet of names.

I pray that Ms. Rowling's feelings aren't hurt by the reviews this book has received, she is so obviously a kind and sensitive person, and so incredibly gifted.  And I truly hope she publishes another adult novel because I still adore her as a writer and a storyteller and would be the first in line to buy a copy.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|As a long time zztop fan, I had hoped for a good album, after the past two disasters.<br /><br />sorry, but this album (for me) has none of the charm of the old (tres hombres) units or the eliminator cd.  it's painful to see, but I am done buying their stuff, I think.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|A fantastic psychological thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock, which grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't let go until it's shocking conclusion. The notion that something is not quite right lingers throughout the film, but you can't put your finger on exactly what it is. Wonderful performances by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz as husband and wife who move to the suburbs in search of a peaceful place to raise their daughters and Naomi Watts as their neighbour. The viewer's realities are shattered more than once forcing a shift in perception to understand what you are seeing and what is truly going on.<br /><br />Chris Alderson<br />Author of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide
B00932HEX2|4.0|I happened to see a recommendation for this show by Lisa Kudrow in a People Magazine interview, and thought I would take a look.  It is more like the Manchurian Candidate than I expected, and seems to be entertaining so far.<br /><br />Hopefully, most viewers will take this show with a block of salt, since it is more propaganda than reality.  Brody is not even an American actor, much less a Marine, and the CIA has a better record of protecting Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and other international monopolies, as well as, stealing/controlling patents & natural resources like oil, water, illegal drugs and minerals, than protecting US citizens.  (Whatever happened to the oil from Iraq that was supposed to pay for the war?)<br /><br />For a real US Marine General's outlook, read \\"War is a Racket\\" by Smedley D. Butler. [ASIN:1908388323 War Is A Racket; with The War Prayer and The Complaint of Peace]] or [[ASIN:1478387653 War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldier]]<br /><br />More food for thought: Why wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald watched this closely when he came back from Russia with a Russian wife, or was he, and really just a patsy?[
0790729628|5.0|One of the best sci-fi films ever. The elimination of the narration and the last scene are, on balance, an improvement. I still don't see Deckard as being a Replicant, which, if true, changes the meaning in what is to me a negative way. I guess I need to read the original.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Longtime fans of The Killers may have mixed reactions to this album.  Instrumentally the songs are heavier on synth/keyboard parts than earlier albums and many of the songs have less of a bite.  Anyone expecting a clone of Hot Fuss or Sam's Town etc.. may be disappointed, but at the core this is a very good album with the same story-line lyrics and creative twists to each song.  Battle Born reflects a growing maturity in the band and Brandon Flowers in particular.  Hopefully fans will be ready to grow with them.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|An autorun platformer that rewards reflexes and timing with beautiful art, graphics, and most of all, fun. If you enjoyed Rayman Origins and are looking for something similar although in a &quot;lite&quot; form, get this game!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I must admit that I never write reviews which is bad because I depend on them so much when making a purchase, but I couldn't resist rating this book.  This is a book I wished I had sampled first because I would NOT have bought it. There were a lot of twists and turns in the book that was just enough to keep you reading but in the end, left you hanging.  I felt the author just gave up at the end and wanted to give it a quick (and totally unsatisfying) ending. If this had been a loaned book, I probably would have stopped reading after the first few chapters. But since I paid for it, I felt compelled to finish it, hoping it would get better.  The excellent ratings could not have come from avid readers and this should not be a best seller.
B001HPP2X2|4.0|I honestly don't remember a lot of what happened during this season, but I'm pretty sure he still hasn't gotten caught  or stopped killing people who kill people.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I watched this movie at the request of my son who had seen it after me telling him WHO Tom Hardy was, Star Trek Nemesis, Inception, Wuthering Heights...<br /><br />Let me say first off I an not a fan of violent movies - the old beat 'em up kind...but this was sooo much more.  The back story made the movie and Tommy had SO MUCH RAGE...you could totally feel his pain.  I won't spoil the movie for those who have not seen it but suffice it say I was rooting for Tommy until the bitter end.  I was crying at the end and not a delicate cry - a sobbing cry - I was exhausted.  I will watch this one again.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I had merged the second and third movies together in my memory, I like my version better. We bought this after watching the Old Murder House production of Jurassic Park, it rekindled my love for making fun of little girl hackers and rooting for dinosaurs.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Have tried a few different solutions to connect my iPhones to my OEM (Jeep) and after-market (Alpine) car stereo systems.  The Schosche converter failed to live up to expectations and would frequently cause the iPhone to disconnect from the stereo.  The CableJive dockStubz successfully connects my iPhones (4 and 5) to my stereo systems and allows the device to be charged and has worked flawlessly with the connection to the stereo system.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|I have not finished this season, we took a break from watching it every night to catch up on The League. I'm sure this season would have blown my mind when it first aired.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|Enjoyed thoroughly this CD, in special Metalica's version for \\"When a Blind Man Cries\\", where the mix of slow and heavy music was nothing short of perfect. Even the most different version of them all, Flaming Lips version for \\"Smoke on the Water\\", is really interesting. Plus you have Steve Vai, Glen Hughes, Chickenfoot, Jimmy Barnes...
B003L77GRY|4.0|I honestly don't remember a lot of what happened during this season, but I'm pretty sure he still hasn't gotten caught  or stopped killing people who kill people.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really liked this book a lot even though I rarely read YA. It had a unique twist to the love story and the slamming was something I've never seen in a book before. Would recommend!

B004TTHLBE|3.0|I'm not going to bother reviewing the book, as there are many great reviews here and elsewhere. I'll also admit that $3.99 is a steal even for the original. I will warn those interested in watching the videos that were supposed to be part of the enhanced version, that it appears to have very little support. I could not view them on my transformer prime or my pc, which are both top of the line technology. I can only assume they ONLY work on actual kindle devices? this sort of thing should be made clear, and I won't be buying another \\"enhanced\\" book for kindle until it is.

B004ZJZPWA|5.0|For some inexplicable reason my husband loves this ridiculous movie. Maybe it's everybody going over the top or maybe he's imagining Wolverine fighting vampires.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It sucks up my battery and it doesn't update as often as I ask it to, but it's a thousand times better than the other weather app I had.  It's accurate and visually beautiful.

B0053KWDES|4.0|After all the noise on head-fi.org, I decided to purchase one.<br /><br />It's an amplifier, that's it - does what it's supposed to - amplifies, and does it acceptably! Please don't fall for the clatter about \\"dramatic improvements\\", \\"increases soundstage\\", etc.<br /><br />The good<br /><br />+ Amplifies and drives well<br /><br />The ugly!<br /><br />- Cannot be used when under charge<br />- Charge time lasts 7 to 8 hours
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is by far the best season of television I have ever seen. I have never been happier with a purchase.
0142410705|5.0|This was honestly one of the best books i've ever read! I couldnt put it down! It only took me 5 hours to finish the book... during school.
B000W4HIX6|4.0|I bought this to watch on Christmas, it is also a good watch on the 4th of July. I recommend getting some cap guns from Dollar General and shooting along with McClane, no badge required.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I  love this  movie, did not expected any less from this awesome cast!!! I love it from beginning to  end.
0399226907|5.0|This book I own as part of my children's book collection; the opinion given here is my honest opinion.<br /><br />The children in my preschool class have enjoyed this book since the start of the school year. Yesterday, a group of four children sat with the book and 'pretended' to read it to each other. All four children knew all the words from memory and they read it repeatedly to each other. It is a delightful book and simple so children soon learn the words to use it as a pre-reader using picture clues for the words. It also teaches about the way a butterfly starts as an egg and ends up after two other steps a butterfly. A great children's book is one that meets many needs of the reader and The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one such book for young children.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the book, personally I never read any books with so much sex in it but I was so curious I bought the first one.  The book did have a good story line and the first book made you want to read the others.  I think the writer gave us a good story line but I also think all the sex was not necessary but I understood why it was done like that.  I think if she decides to keep writing her books would be read because for me any book you read should have a good story and not just go on and on.  This writer gave us a good story and I would read her books.  I like James Patterson, Tami Hoag, loved Robert Ludlum and authors like them.  I will now add her to my list hopefully. I am not writing this for customers comments because I feel that everyone have a right to their opinion and this is mine.<br /><br />V.
B003R50FRI|5.0|This was quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. I went to India shortly after reading this book and I felt like it gave me more of an open mind whilst in Mumbai as it's certainly not a tourist destination.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you like his previous books you will like this one too, another great story. Can't wait for the next one!
1451620829|5.0|I really think Peter focused on the story and the good times as well as the bad times. He was sincere about his feelings but he told the story in a way that I've never read before. I mean most of the stories I knew, but he added bits and details that were really interesting and made me not want to stop reading. The story of Sean Delaney was hilarious and made you see him in a different way, like he was really the fifth Kiss member. Really good biography of KISS as seen through his eyes. He admits to some of his faults but not as much as he could've. But of course, life through your eyes, almost always you're going to see yourself as a victim. Still, he wrote in a fresh way, I actually had never read something so beautiful as when he writes about their companionship at the beginning of Kiss, that was really good! These guys were so different and still they got along just because of their goal, to be the best ROCK BAND. Peter, wherever you are, God bless you! And all of the other guys in Kiss also! and thank you for the book!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a lot of this type of story, drawn to it I guess. This one was more compelling than most. Can't wait for more of the story to be revealed.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Currently running this on a Motorola Xoom.  This is an excellent app, and really makes you think.  The physics are excellent, and the app does a great job of \\"showing\\" you your weak structures by changing color.  You can easily observe the locations that are stressed when under load because the beam or structure starts turning red.  The darker the color, the more stress is being placed on the location, and you can \\"rework\\" your structure to balance the load.  Controls work well, and the developer did an excellent job of making certain physics are correct.  Some of the bridges are easy, and others are quite difficult.  With constraints on material and cost, it is really quite realistic.  It keeps me engaged for hours.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was a good credible lesbian love story. Great acting and touched on subjects that affect us today. I must admit that I would have loved to see more skin but the love scenes were intimate. Now I need to learn how to stream it from my lap top to my TV.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it was cool..... but now it just is frozen. don't buy it<br />grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr it wont let me play with out a password
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Love this album, Got to see them Live at a club show this summer! Was one of the best and loudest shows i had ever seen.
0307960471|5.0|I have been a fan of \\"Nordic Noir\\" since Reading Stieg  Larsson's Dragon Tattoo series. This  led me to Hanning Mankell and the Wallender series.  Now I am reading Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole crime novels,  and I am really hooked. I thought that Nesbo could do no better than \\"The Leopard\\" until I finished \\"Snowman.\\"Phantom\\" exceeds both of those. It's a real page turner and I read it so fast that I had to re-read as soon as I finished because its complexity caused me to miss some critical plot points and clues as to the identity of the phantom and some character motivation issues. To a first time Nesbo reader there are some warnings: This novel contains extreme violence with no sugar coating and can be quite disturbing The drug use is pervasive throughout and forms a major theme of the novel. The sex is graphic and is delivered without airbrushing either.<br />The novel begins with the final thoughts of a young murder victim reflecting on his father and the victim's drug consumed life, as a stray rat tries to get past him to return to her nest.(metaphor?) Harry has returned to Norway from Hong Kong where he has been in recovery from his alcoholism, to determine why his foster son has been involved in this murder.<br />The novel covers police corruption, the Russian Mafia's drug trade and the underbelly of criminal activity in Norway, a country that we think to be a just and egalitarian society, with few of the social or economic problems that we Americans are subject to. Jo Nesbo rips the scab off this concept and demonstrates that evil can exist anywhere - even in an ideal place like Norway.<br />The ending is ambiguous and serves as a bookend for the opening scene. I give this one my highest recommendation, but don't ignore the caveat at the beginning of this review.<br /><br />Note on Pronunciation: Hole is approximately \\"Holeh\\" and Harry is usually written as \\"Hari\\" in some Scandinavian languages
B004SBX112|4.0|We want an update too! Come on Rovio, you could at least release the Play Store &amp; Amazon updates at the same time so we dont feel left out!
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love this product. I put it on my laptop and my tablet and of course my cell phone. Thanks.
0345803493|5.0|I found this book interesting and a great shocker. I read the 50 shades of Grey first and I loved it. I didn't expect what happened in this novel but I really liked it. Ok the things that Ana and Christian does as they are adults are their business and Kate should stay in her lane. I understand she wants to be protective but Ana is grown. I'm glad she stepped back. I love Christian being to the rescue but he can be too overbearing and protective. Ana is grown and should be allowed to go and come as she pleases as does Christian. The scene with the crazy chick and his work and her bowing down got me. No I would have just felt that to be cool. She was another grown woman that embarked on a life as a sub and so his constent involvement with her mental stability is a bit troubling considering she left him alone and got married. Ok her marriage didn't work out but it's not Ana fault. She accepted his crazy Dominant sexual lifestyle decided she wanted to move on and now she's had a break down??? Elena, what??? This will be an interesting movie, I think...I'm an erotica author and I am a little bit more but this is nice and I love it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|about time i have played BlockStory and MC both are good games in my opinion but both good games i like both none of them are rated because both are good games
0345803485|5.0|This is jaw dropping and I loved every moment. Why was I crying at the end of this book as if it were me leaving??? What I don't know what it is about Christian Grey but I'm so in love with that Grey eyed monster, lover, dominant, sadist!!! Great read...Loved looking up the words...You'll love it, trust me and get out of trying to find all the faults and incorrect grammer and get into the story!!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie \\"Prometheus\\" is not bad.  It borrows a great deal from many other movies, such as the \\"Alien\\" series, \\"Event Horizon,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"2001,\\" and many more.  But it blends ideas from those other movies together with some creativity, and it does offer a couple of new tweaks.  The underlying premise, presented in an interesting and very dramatic way at the very beginning, is somewhat new in this major-movie genre.  I thought more could have been done throughout the movie to detail the premise and keep one's thoughts churning on a deeper level.  Still, the acting, pacing, and special effects are all done fairly well, so that we fans don't feel cheated.  There was a twist at the end that might have been partly for the purpose of setting up a sequel, but it was a somewhat intriguing and thought-provoking twist.  \\"Prometheus\\" wasn't intensely gripping, but I was entertained, and my thoughts were provoked -- a bit.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|Look, I love Rick Riordan, but people, what you really need to understand that these books have changed and that Rick Riordan lost all his fame during his Percy Jackson years. The new series have dull action, very little sense of humor, and absolutely NO suspense.  Want to read it still? Get it from the library,  toss it once your done, then pick up percy jackson, DJ MacHale's Pendragon saga,  and JK Rowling stuff.  You may not read this and really care, but if you do, reply to my review.  Please dont buy this and waste your money.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have used this both to watch and to list products for sale.  While it is well set up, It is missing some small things like the number of views on a auction.  It however hits the important things on eBay well.  It works grate on my Kindle Fire.
0316098515|4.0|Reviewing the sophisticated and elegant recipes in this beautifully photographed volume show just how far Eleven Madison Park has come in the years since its inception as a \\"mere\\" upscale bistro, an evolution that is succinctly recounted in the accompanying text.<br /><br />One of the most obvious truths that the reader will discover is that these dishes are uniformly beyond the amateur cook who will lack the ingredients, time and talent to prepare them.  And anything one creates at home is unlikely to even remotely approach the professional perfection of the plates pictured here.  (Though, if the truth be told, some of the arrangements are so frivolous as to appear almost ridiculous.)<br /><br />However, a recipe is mostly an idea, amenable to any level of interpretation.  In that spirit, it would be a very dull mind indeed that did not find much culinary inspiration from this work, even if only a desire to visit the restaurant.  On that basis, I recommend it without reservation.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Great job ABC. We are enjoying Season 1. I would recommend this series to all<br /> age groups! We watch the episodes as a family. So glad we made the purchase!
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|My wife wanted to see this movie so she could see \\"more\\" of TRUE BLOOD's Joe Manganiello, who sadly doesn't get a lot of screen time.  Fellow TV stars Matt Bomer and Adam Rodriguez share the same fate, as does pro wrestler Kevin Nash.  That leaves the bulk of MAGIC MIKE to Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer and Matthew McConaughey.  Perky Cody Horn is the primary female who acts appropriately shrewish as Pettyfer's big sister.<br />My problem with MAGIC MIKE is it's boring and never really goes anywhere.  It only comes to life with the dances and they aren't that exciting.  Tatum, whose personal experiences formed the plot, is not that impressive an actor; Pettyfer has little screen presence and good old Matthew swaggers and poses like he usually does.<br />It's obvious that this is just an eye candy project and the plot is secondary to the abs and buttocks.<br />However, the movie was a surprise box office success and a Tatum-directed sequel is planned.  Hopefully by the time MIKE 2 hits DVD, my wife will get to see the latest season of TRUE BLOOD and will satisfy her Manganiello fix!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Pleasantly suprised with book. I could not put it down! I am looking forward the next book! I am so in love with these character's!

1455502626|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I've read it several times, and usually take it with me on vacation in case I'm not enjoying my current beach book. It's a great mystery, but more important, it's a great read, as are all his John Corey and Paul Brenner books. I love DeMille's writing syle and his dry wit. None better!
0843176555|5.0|My kids love these books! The hardback ones are a bit more durable than the paperback. The illustrations are fun and kids love them!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|one of the best movies ever, third in box office worldwide. you just have to get it on bluray 3D or just get it, it freaking awesome!! dont forget theres a hidden scene during the credits, possibly two, one mid credits and another at the very end
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this slowed my phone down, dropped my 4g constantly and caused the battery to drain.  this app is horrible and was the root of all my problems.  I will never download this again if I can help it and I would suggest others do the same.  use the website...its faster and less drain on your phone.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Beautiful and inspiring, a true awakening. if ever you feel that the world is functioning perfectly but you find yourself perfectly without function than this book is for you.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The game was fun, not too difficult, &amp; not short. The &quot;story&quot; was intriguing &amp; kept me interested. It wasn't quick but would have enjoyed a longer game. I didn't have any technical  problems.
B0016O95IW|5.0|This band has given me some faith in new rock music. I think this is a great album with some really awesome songs. especially like \\"Hate My Life\\", \\"Little Smirk\\", and \\"Crutch\\" because I can relate to the lyrics.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Amazing that this volume remained in a vault for so long.  One can only imaging the depths of the remaining art contained within the vaults.  A true work of art. I cannot wait for the next release.
B003SI05PG|4.0|Wonderful movie by Tim Burton. May be a little scary or hard to follow for kids under 4, but they may like the music. My 3 year old daughter had lots of questions and hid under her blanket a few times, but she sung the \\"This is Halloween\\" song for weeks. Definitely needs to be in your Movie Library.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best but I cant get it on my kindle I don't know why but the good thing is that it is free!!!
B0053O89JM|5.0|very good transaction, product was super ready to work.  funny content, goes round and round in my dvd player.  It ejects nicely as well
B005LAJ16I|5.0|What can I say?  After seeing all the awards this series won, we decided to order the DVD's since we don't get Showtime.  There are 4 discs, each with 3 episodes.  We sat down and watched the whole thing in only a couple of nights.  We kept saying, &#34;just one more&#34; but couldn't stop watching!!  It's that addicting!  Now, I don't know how we're going to wait a whole season before we find out what happened.  Obviously, we'd recommend this to everyone.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is  a pretty good game. Good graphics. Good game. Like I said.  Good good good. I wish 13 words were enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love puzzle games and this is one of my favorites. A while ago I purchased a similar game for my ds and was sad when I comepleted it. This isn't the exact same as that game even, just the concept of not crossing the lines.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|fun cheap game for hours of fun. I can't wait for part two to come out. I really enjoyed this game.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|After listening to Taylor Swift's fourth album \\"RED\\", I conclude that it is her best album.  It is Swift's most diverse, mature, and features the most number of strong songs. The songwriting and production is strong. The themes on `RED' are familiar for Swift: love lost, love found, problems in love.  Except now, they are narrated by an `adult', not a teenager. However, Swift is young at heart and not much different as an adult. A teenager could sing about the same things.<br /><br />It's the most diverse album because it features a variety of genres - pop-rock, country, country-pop, pop, and even a touch of dubstep.  It also sophisticated moments and sugary sweet moments.  Contrast the first two singles - the bubblegum pop \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and pure country ballad \\"Begin Again\\". Some country fans have complained that the album is too pop and not enough country.  While \\"RED\\" has the most pop elements of all her albums, it's equally a country album as it is a pop album.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"State of Grace\\", an uptempo, U2-like pop-rock number. Like \\"WANEGBT\\", \\"22\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" are upbeat poppy tunes. \\"22\\" demonstrates what I said about Taylor being young at heart (\\"It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters, and make fun of our exes\\").  It shuns bar hopping (\\"This place is too crowded, too many cool kids\\").  Like \\"Begin Again\\", \\"I Almost Do\\" and \\"All Too Well\\" are beautiful country ballads. The title track \\"Red\\" is upbeat country-pop track. \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" and \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\" are nice acoustic ballads.  Rising Brit singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is featured on \\"Everything Has Changed\\" - a nice collaboration.<br /><br />Any fans of pop and/or country (especially fans of both) should check out \\"RED\\".
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Really, you have to go back to Degüello to get close to this.  From the initial boogie of \\"Gotsta Get Paid\\" (already a classic rock staple), to the thumping \\"Have a Little Mercy\\", this is a ZZ Top record you will put on and never hit the skip button.
B0067PEDLE|5.0|Wow! Amazing read I completed it in an evening! I really connected with the characters and highly recommend this book to everyone!

B007THA4FI|3.0|Had trouble keeping track of the many characters; actually made of list of who's who and who belonged with whom.  They story all came together at the end, but it seemed to take a long time getting there.
044661758X|5.0|I LOVE mystery and this book is the best I've read in a long time.  I thought I wouldn't find another mystery author I would like as much as Robert Parker (how I miss him!), but Connelly is definitely my new favorite!  This book is a page turner and kept me reading way into the night!  A Psychological thriller at it's best!  Twists and turns we all love, never really knowing who did it until the end.  Ready for The Last Coyote now and can't wait to get into it!
B009P13RQY|5.0|These American dudes from Austin, TX  plain arse \\"hard rock\\".  This is the first time, in a long time, I downloaded a complete album.  If you like the style of classic Black Sabbath, you will not regret getting this album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really great read. The main chracters take you on a mystical journey through Rome where Annabeth finds out her true destiny. The book is so good that I read it like 10 times and STILL feels like Im reading it for the first time again.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is my favorite Halloween Movie.  Bette Midler is very funny and it has a great story.  A great family movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Collins writes very well. I wish this trilogy came out when I was a teenager. The author paints a very clear picture, and I had no moments of confusion. However, and unlike The Hunger Games, the ending did not feel fluent. THG had a moment of relaxation after the arena and then perfectly made you anticipate a second book. In Catching Fire, the ending hit me like a wall. Other than that, I have no problems and would recommend the first two books to anybody. I just started the third.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was originally going to purchase just the Blu-ray and DVD set but then I saw the 4 disk pack for only a ýfew dollars more. It is full of great extras and having the sound track was a good bonus. If you want the ýwhole Avengers Experience I recommend getting the 4 disk combo..You can't go wrong with it!ý
B002SRQ214|5.0|I have to give it to amazon on this one. Recieved the 1st one, which was damaged and got a replacement fast. This is the first time i had to exchange a product. Amazon made it simple and painless. Thank you<br /><br />I build custom computers, and used this cpu in a new AMD build using the sabertooth 990FX chipset. The product is as discribed, its a fast processor and it matches will to the new AMD boards that support it.

B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones are durable, comfortable yet affordable. The sound quality is adequate and the head band is fairly flexible. My only concern is the insertion point of the wire into the ear bud can rip out if you are too aggressive when taking the head phones off.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|I have so enjoyed all the Tinker Bell movies that have come from the Disney/Pixar studios, & I was not the least bit disappointed in this latest entry.<br /><br />Among all the faeries in Pixie Hollow, Tinker Bell has always been the most adventurous fairy.<br /><br />While she enjoys her life as a tinker, & has made a lot of friends, she has this insatiable curiosity to explore beyond her own little \\"nitch\\" in Pixie Hollow.<br /><br />Pixie Hollow is an area of Neverland, where all four seasons exists side by side-Summer, Autumn, Winter, & Spring.<br /><br />But Winter, has always been forbidden to enter for the fairies of Spring, Summer, & Autumn, because the cold could very easily damage their wings-even causing them to break, if not immediately treated.<br /><br />But that isn't about to stop Tinker Bell.<br /><br />After something causes her wings to start glowing, after a very brief trip into Winter Wood, Tinker Bell fashions winter clothes to keep her warm, & stows away in baskets that the other tinker faeries, have made for the winter faeries.<br /><br />There she meets frost fairy named Periwinkle, who she discovers was born of the same child's laugh that Tinker Bell was born from-which makes them sisters.<br /><br />Tinker Bell & Periwinkle aren't about to break off their friendship, just because they live in two different worlds, even if it IS forbidden.<br /><br />We see Tinker Bell's ingenuity in making it possible for Periwinkle to visit Tinker Bell's world, which almost ends in disaster for the frost fairy.<br /><br />We find out from both Queen Clarion & the winter lord, Lord Malori, why it is forbidden for the warm weather fairies & the winter faeries to ever be together.<br /><br />When the machine that Tinker Bell, with her friends Clank & Bobble, made to show Periwinkle the warm lands, causes a freeze that threatens ALL the seasons of Pixie Hollow, it is up to both Tinker Bell & Periwinkle to save the most important area in all of Neverland-the Pixie Dust Tree, source of all their magic, & indeed, their very lives, because the Pixies Dust tree links both Winter Woods & the warm lands.<br /><br />Voice casting in this movie reunites all the major characters of Pixie Hollow.<br /><br />We also see familiar voices as well, including Disney alumni Timothy Dalton, (Mr. Pricklepants, from Toy Story 3), as the voice of Lord Malori, & Jodi Benson, (of Little Mermaid fame, as a healing fairy).<br /><br />What I found very enjoyable, was how Tinker Bell's former nemesis, Vidia-had \\"toned-down\\" her cynicism & contempt of Tinker Bell, (which was undoubtedly due to Tinker Bell rescuing her in the previous movie-Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue).  But you could still see traces of her cynicism throughout the movie, though Tinker Bell & her had resolved much of their rivalry with each other, & were indeed friends.<br /><br />The music, the storyline, the interaction among all the fairies, kept this movie moving very well, & I was never bored during it.<br /><br />The characters have been very believable throughout all the previous movies, & that has not changed here.<br /><br />This is another excellent addition to the vast library of Disney movies, & is sure to become a classic, as the past 3 Tinker Bell movies have become!ixie Dust Tree, source of all their magic, & indeed, their very lives, because the Pixies Dust tree links both Winter Woods & the warm lands.<br /><br />Voice casting in this movie reunites all the major characters of Pixie Hollow.<br /><br />We also see familiar voices as well, including Disney alumni Timothy Dalton, (Mr. Pricklepants, from Toy Story 3), as the voice of Lord Malori, & Jodi Benson, (of Little Mermaid fame, as a healing fairy).<br /><br />What I found very enjoyable, was how Tinker Bell's former nemesis, Vidia-had \\"toned-down\\" her cynicism & contempt of Tinker Bell, (which was undoubtedly due to Tinker Bell rescuing her in the previous movie-Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue).

B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Norman Babcock has a lot of friends, unfortunately they are all dead. He has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts of people and animals and because of that he is considered weird at school and even to his own family. He is bullied at school because of his abilities and his only friend is Neil who is an overweight boy who is also bullied.<br /><br />The small town of Blithe Hollow, where they live, has quite a history that includes the execution of a witch 300 years ago. Norman begins having visions of the event while he is rehearsing for the school play in which he has a role. He is also approached by a wild looking man who claims to also see the dead and tells Norman that he is the only one that can stop the return of the witch's curse including the attack of 7 zombies on the town.....<br /><br />We took our grandson to see this movie and he loved it. Tonight he is going to a haunted house with his father and so it is a big scary day for him. This is a very good movie and it is entertaining for many age groups. The graphics and storyline were well written and my wife and I enjoyed it as much as our grandson.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG and some parts are pretty intense. It may be too much for younger or sensitive children. At the end of the film one of the teenage characters reveals that he has a boyfriend and several people have taken offense to that being in a cartoon story. If that is offensive to you or you do not want to possibly be asked the question on the way home of why Mitch has a boyfriend, you might want to avoid this movie.<br /><br />It is a good story line about bullying and how a couple of young boys save the town from a paranormal event. It can be scary to some children so make your viewing choice wisely. We enjoyed the movie and we all gave it 5 stars.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Game is a bit different and i liked it. The only thing i would change is that right now you can not make another move until the previous move is completely done. Like in jewels u can keep going and not have to wait. Other than that wish it was longer. Great game and affects.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|grate game pretty good I think it is sweet. needs a little improvement but it is still pretty good. I stol do not like buying t.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom once again created an engaging book. The early chapters sets up a mystery and gradually the pieces of the puzzle come together. The ideas presented are thought-provoking and engaging. It is definately a book with ideas that will stay with the reader.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Very good and exciting movie!  A little bit of a psychological thriller. A little bit of the unknown element.  Almost no bad language.
B00122HT04|5.0|Everything I love about A7X. A must for any Avenged fan. Little Piece of Heaven is a favorite as is Scream.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Oh My God!! What can I say.  Dark comedy with a little science fiction added.  Jonny Depp made the movie.  A must see!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sad. Happy. Hot. Disturbing. Sexy. Twisted. Couldn't put it down. Second book was better than the first. I can't wait for the next one.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Loved this movie!  Action packed but not quite an unexpected ending.  Digital aliens were great! The artifical robot really gave away the story.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really want to say this game is great,I'm 61 and it is so much fun to play and I mean for hours.I only have one problem! I downloaded this to my HTC now I have a Samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket I'm having trouble getting it on my new phone can you help with this problem thanks woody bob
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Very good and exciting movie!  I loved it to the end.  A lot of action and a little bit of the unknown element.
B008FC4WA4|1.0|This was a waste of time. It was a short story that lacked creativity, a decent plot, excitement and it was poorly written. I've liked other Hornby books, but would not recommend his to anyone.
030758836X|1.0|Big fan of DARK PLACES, although not a reader of crime fiction, I bought the Kindle edition.  Like many others here, wish I had saved my money and not added to Flynn's big wad of cash.  Had she found another way to progress the story once the crime is established, I wouldn't have felt such derision for the second half.  In comparison, I thought the ending was dead on.  No big dramatics.  Just the creeping sense that life would be pretty awful for the both of them.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I love everything about the Titanic and being able to have the movie in DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital format just means I can take this fantastic movie everywhere I go!!!
1476712042|5.0|Novel was extremely realistic in every detail. All the relationships were spot on with dysfunctional elements. I fell in love with Abby and Travis. I really like that that Travis wasn't the only one with issues. I loved his devotion to her and the relationship. I would recommend this book to all my friends 20-30 yrs old. I thought the sex scenes played out tastefully and yet still painted a great picture.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|This album changed my life, I dont care what your typical music choice is; buy this thing, hell buy 2 copies in case you lose 1. You can give a copy to your kids or your Grandma. This music is timeless, melodic, and you will never get it out of your head.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Excellent will have it finished tomorrow. Cant wait for the 3rd.Good plot, I found it very enjoyable as I have a particular interest in the lead up to the 2nd World War from the German side. I have recently read some other books conected to the Spanish Civil War so was happy to find it covered here. It has opened another subject for me to read about.<br /><br />Sara E Syme
B008E374T0|4.0|I have to admit, it took me a little while to even listen to this record because the 59 sound was just so amazing that I thought hearing this would ruin my perception of the band but I'm so glad I caved. I have read reviews stating how Brians emulation of the boss just went over the top in this album but there is nothing wrong with some Springsteen influence. Most of the best bands of this generation has Bruce to thank for paving the way. These guys, just like Springsteen and myself are from the real NJ Shore and you can feel it when they play. Fallon`s lyrics are so heartfelt and he sings with so much passion that by the time you are done with the album you feel like you know each other. The only reason i gave 4 stars is because a couple songs near the end start to drag on and lose the intensity thats built up throughout the record. The tracks are still good but last a little too long.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game! I have beaten the game and playing all the levels again. best free app of the day but I would pay $4.99.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is the best drawing/art app I have so far come across. My 3 yr. old uses this all the time and especially loves the stickers and the ability to adjust their size. I also really like how many options there is on this app for the tools (markers, crayons, paintbrushes, etc.) and colors. Its great for older kids who would otherwise get bored quickly with a simpler toddler drawing app.
0756697875|5.0|Everyone has loved this book in our house! All the way from our 2 year old friend, to the 5 year old Birthday Boy who received this as a gift, up to my husband! It is well worth the money, and gets looked at for fun and for reference almost every day. We loved the little lego batman figurine that came with it too.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing story about the thruth of Life, Love and Sex... it takes your beath away to know how many things are posible behind closed doors and in the name of Love...
B008XG1X18|4.0|I think it works great about 90% of the time. There are some random times that it freezes and you cannot do anything.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|I loved her first album but I haven't stopped listening to this album since i got it. I listen to it on repeat while i do stuff around the house and i dance my pants off it's awesome
B009KHCRVO|3.0|I probably would have offered up another half a star if it were an option. This movie didn't have the best acting ever, but it did have an interesting story. Characters weren't too off the rails, and the concept was entertaining. Ignoring the blatantly wrong science in places it was worth watching, maybe not twice, but worth it the first time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kept you turning pages wondering what would happen next.<br />So many turns of events you couldn't predict what was going to happen
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy is extremely well written and intelligent.  The psychological story is as compelling as the sensual/sexual content.  I do hope there is a fourth novel!
1451695195|5.0|I just finished reading Proof of Heaven by Dr. Eben Alexander.  In fact, once I started it, I could barely put the book down.  I grew up in a Christian home and always believed there was an afterlife, so I had no difficulty believing Dr. Alexander's story.  What made it particularly interesting, however, is the fact he is a Harvard Neurosurgeon who, prior to his \\"experience,\\" placed little creedence in the idea that we do survive the death of the body.  The book goes into tremendous detail regarding the physical manifestation of the disease the eventually placed him in a coma for 7-days.  Dr. Alexander also offers several ideas to explain away his visions of the afterlife, but in the end he concludes that none of these explanations actually make sense, and he did, in fact visit heaven.  After reading this well-written book, I believe most people will also conclude as I did, that Dr. Eben truly entered the heavenly realms and  came back to tell us about it.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, but particularly to those who are losing or have lost a loved one.  This book will persuade you that your loved one is truly in a better place.

B008RJFRTK|5.0|Downloaded while in Europe.  The detail maps I downloaded of Italy and Switzerland were very helpful, even when without wi-fi.  Now have downloaded details of my home state and part of Canada.  It is a great app and well worth the money.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Well, I think that's all i need to say apart from the 18 unlockable gadgets, 12 unlockable jetpacks, all sorts of costumes, challenges, upgradeable vehicles, and achievements. A great side scroller that is free! I've &quot;prestiged&quot; 4 times and haven't gotten bored yet! Try it out yourself to see if you like it!
B009O8I34O|5.0|This one may not be one of the action packed thrillers that draw some to this series, but it does give a better look into the character of Ducky and puts him in a very different role showing off a side that is too rarely seen.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was totally disappointed from beginning to end with this book.  I'm the type of reader that when I commit to a book I have to see it through.  This was one of the hardest.  There is not one character worth cheering for or caring about.  The language is filthy.  The plot was boring and I was hoping that the whole town would disappear in the last chapter.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Excellent in every way shape and viewing pleasure.  Great entertainment. Worth the price of the movie to have in the collection of the Avengers.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Fast delivery, great condition.I brought the movie for my daughter who loves all princess movies. The movie was/is another Disney classic.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Robin Sloan has a magical way of weaving modern technology into this story that makes it a very fun read.  The characters are so smart and interesting to follow.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Not one of his best. Very predictable.  Being a former paralegal working for attorneys, I found situations not very believable.  No way would some of the things happen in a real courtroom!  The attorneys came across as bumbling idiots.  Hard to have any sympathy for any of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the most Amazons game I have ever played and trust me I've played ALOT of games .
B007GCY8FS|3.0|not one of his best the auther fell into the word trap using to many words to discribe every thing like discribing what clothes a person is wearing or the furniture in a room.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this game on my phone and I also have it on my kindle fire. fun way to pass the time away.
B007MDB548|5.0|This is the best Tinkerbell movie by far! The animation is fantastic and the colors pop off the screen. The 3D was really good also, not alot of pop out, but definitely bring alot of depth to the movie. My kids set through the whole thing just amazed. The story just grabs your attention from the start. Hope the next Tinkerbell movie is just as great. Don't rent this, BUY it!
B0090SVDO0|4.0|The Hollywood Bowl was a prestigious booking for any rock band, and maybe more so for The Doors. They were local boys who made it and the Hollywood Bowl was proof of that. It was a hometown crowd and The Doors were out to give the best show they could. They rehearsed for the show (something they didn't ordinarily do especially after Jim Morrison became more estranged from the band), they prepared a set-list and they seemed to stick to it and The Doors gave a pretty tight performance at the Hollywood Bowl on July 5, 1968.<br /><br />\\"The Doors: Live at the Bowl `68\\" is the companion soundtrack to the DVD/Blu-Ray of the same name that was released earlier this week (October 22, 2012) and while it may not be as good a stand alone item as \\"[[ASIN:B0090O07S2 Live at the Bowl '68]]\\"  DVD/Blu-Ray, it's still a good soundtrack to the Hollywood Bowl shows and would have made a good live album in 1968, if it weren't for technical difficulties, but you can't rewrite The Doors.<br /><br />In the spring of 1968 The Doors had decided to film their shows for a documentary film that would later become \\"Feast of Friends\\" and the Hollywood Bowl was filmed with an eye to inclusion in the film. But during three songs, \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" \\"The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat),\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan,\\" Morrison's microphone feed to the recording equipment failed and compromised the show until technology caught up. Although \\"The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" was released in 1989 it was incomplete, there was nothing either The Doors or Bruce Botnick could do to restore the three missing songs, until now. Long time Doors engineer (and co-producer of \\"L.A. Woman\\") Bruce Botnick through the magic of digital technology was able to piece together the missing songs and now the Hollywood Bowl show is complete in the release of \\"The Doors: Live at the Bowl `68.\\"<br /><br />The CD sounds great! The sound `POPS!' out at you, you can hear everything clearly from Morrison shaking maracas near the microphone (which the audience probably never heard!) and it sounds like drummer John Densmore is bashing his way to a new drum kit, Morrison's voice is a strong growl, Robby Krieger's guitar tears out into the Hollywood Hills, and Ray Manzarek's keyboards and bass gives the band a full, filled out sound, it must have been something to see and hear the show live!<br /><br />The strengths of the CD are also some of the strengths of the DVD/Blu-Ray, the deconstruction of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" that had poetic segues into the more traditional songs such as \\"Light My Fire\\" creates a jarring, disconcerting and theatrical effect. Morrison demonstrates his command of an audience, highlighted during \\"The End,\\" his `Have you seen the accident outside' section creates the feel and mood of a house party with a rumor running through it and when Morrison sees a grasshopper onstage he creates the impromtu \\"Ode to a Grasshopper.\\" When he realizes it's a moth says \\"uh-oh, I blew it, it's a moth\\" and gets a laugh, but he pulls everyone back into the tension and drama of the song.<br /><br />The CD contains a couple of weaknesses the DVD/Blu-Ray doesn't. Since this concert was filmed a lot of the crowd reaction you hear on the CD is dependent on seeing what Jim Morrison is doing onstage, without that, it kind of loses its meaning and context within the show. The CD comes in cardboard CD case and not a jewel case. And while the DVD/Blu-Ray contains more than your average bonus features section the CD contains no bonus tracks or special features.<br /><br />The CD of \\"The Doors: Live at the Bowl `68\\" is great to have in your car and cruise around listening to and playing the movie in your head.<br /><br />Jim Cherry writes The Doors Examinerhe microphone (which the audience probably never heard!) and it sounds like drummer John Densmore is bashing his way to a new drum kit, Morrison's voice is a strong growl, Robby Krieger's guitar tears out into the Hollywood Hills, and Ray Manzarek's keyboards and bass gives the band a full, filled out sound, it must have been something to see and hear the show live!<br /><br />The strengths of the CD are also some of the strengths of the DVD/Blu-Ray, the deconstruction of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" that had poetic segues into the more traditional songs such as \\"Light My Fire\\" creates a jarring, disconcerting and theatrical effect.

0007144369|5.0|Great condition. Awesome collection. As an educator, there are several items that I plan to use in class. As an avid reader, a great volume to have on the shelves. The book arrived on time and in great condition. It's a big one, and one that is great to review at random - not necessarily to read front to back. Thanks.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I suspect this is who Pete Townshend really is because I can't imagine anyone would want to portray themselves as such disingenuously.  I'm a bit disappointed with this book and this autobiography--it seemed a little dry for someone so eloquent and witty.  I'm disappointed with the author because I find his claims of low self esteem so lame in one with such narcissism.  If he ever did disclose having discovered he was sexually abused I missed it, and while I wouldn't wish that on anyone it almost seemed he was hoping to find it--look at those unfortunate study participants.  I couldn't help but think the author was trying after to the fact to build a case for the event that garnered his arrest, though I really do not believe he had any prurient interest in child pornography.<br /><br />His cavalier dismissal of his unfortunate wife and marriage is appalling to me-- again those early references of wanting to remain faithful seem to be added so as to soften any harsh feelings after the fact.  While I wish he and Ms. Fuller the best perhaps her lifestyle and willingness to be amongst  the author's entourage may guarantee her longevity--just don't buy a dog that will foreshadow having his child!  One thing that interested me is his lack of insight into how his behavior toward his wife and children imitated his mother's--absent, fueled by substances and self-serving.<br /><br />I feel bad having to register these criticisms--I've adored The Who and the author's music for years.  But there seemed little response to Keith's death, and for this addict to refer to his dear friend John as an &#34;alkie&#34; seems overly hurtful.  No wonder John's mom was angry.  One gets the sense that the folks in the author's world have always been about serving his needs--Roger, John, Keith, his wife, now Ms. Fuller.  I also got very little sense of the spiritual connection with Meher Baba, though admittedly I know little of his teachings.<br /><br />All in all this book is worth reading but it saddened me.  The author's life is one of achievement and one deserving admiration and honor.  Who the author is, though, is as I have said, a bit disappointing.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I needed to catch up on SOA season 4 since I was out of the country for most of the season. I loved the format, price and ease of ordering through Amazon. I also enjoyed watching the entire season straight through; I may decided to watch every season this way!
1451620829|5.0|Although Peter's solo album was the worst of the four solo albums released by the members of Kiss, his autobiography is thus far the best. It gives a real and accurate account of the Kiss story through Peter's eyes and really leaves the reader with good understanding of the man warts and all. And there are lots of warts, like his constant complaining, temper tantrums, drug abuse and conspiracy theories. But those warts are part of the intricate makeup of the man and a successful autobiography leaves the reader with an accurate portrait of the author. This book succeeds in that regard much better than Gene's or Ace's.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this to see what all the hype was about and came away confused about the Fifty Shades phenomenon.  The writing style got tedious rather quickly.  With all the \\"Holy ____ \\"'s, I kept waiting for Batman and Robin to pop out at any moment.  And don't even get me started on the \\"Jeez\\"'s.  The descriptions of the sex scenes were strange as well.  Graphic yet prudish at the same time.  All manner of BDSM in graphic detail (which was to be expected and didn't bother me) but references to Ana's female anatomy as \\"down there\\".  Maybe this was to convey her innocence and naivete but I found it rather off-putting. It seems that, in reading other reviews, most people either love this book or hate it, there doesn't seem to be much in between.  I wanted to like this book and jump on the Fifty Shades bandwagon but, I have to say, I was disappointed.
0385344333|1.0|There is no excuse for this type of work.  The book is boring and full of huge holes. Everyone who knows me knows I love the Reacher books.  Lee Child used every method possible to make the book last.  You get descriptions upon descriptions about useless, trivial things.  When a guy pulls a gun on Reacher half way through the book I thought just shoot him so this will be over.<br /><br />Selecting a midget to play a six foot five, two hundred fifty pound man is one thing.  Passing this book off as a Reacher novel is criminal.
B004N66XYE|1.0|After hearing my coworkers rave about this show, and knowing how much I love BBC stuff I blindly bought this, even without reading one review. Lesson learned! 25 bucks for 3 episodes, really?<br />I'm so irritated I spent the money on this crap. If the show would have been good, I  might have been able to let this go, but the show sucks. Maybe I have to high of expectations after Downton Abbey, I don't know, but this is a huge disappointment.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|In addition to this very excellently crafted series, the experience of buying from Amazon is always easy, and a pleasure. I love the series, the actors, especially Peter Dinklage, create a full, rich experience of Martin's dramatic work. I have learned to check first to see what Amazon has in stock when looking for any product. Prices always seem best, delivery is prompt and their return policy and practice is equally easy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series.  The books are entertaining, easy to read, and I love the storyline.  I can't wait for book 3...I have my New Year's Day all planned out!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best site. so informative, and very additive. you can learn so much from pinterest. my husband doesn't understand.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The best book I have read so far. This is so not Fifty, the way the author put this tow characters together is so intoxicating and heart breaking.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This is a well written,superbly plotted novel.It accurately portrays the selfishness,weaknesses and frailty and addictions of men and women. It is trully superbly crafted story.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I thought this book started off well. And it was pretty funny. It started t fizzle out closer to the end though.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Although I do not yet know how this story ends, I can tell you that it is fascinating, gripping, terrifying and heartbreaking and is a testimony to the strength of the human heart. Before reading this I had little awareness of the deep contrast between American and Afghan culture. Could hardly put it down and have given up trying to read it before I go to sleep.
B003G4W4CY|4.0|I want this on my Kindle, and NO edition is available in the US.  WHY NOT??!! I can't imagine that this publisher wouldn't like to sell on Kindle in the US!  What is the problem with the rights?!
0061564893|4.0|If you love literature that challenges the prevailing academic view of an issue, then you'll like this book.  It is well researched and the author's experience as a naval submarine commander has obviously given him insight that ordinary historians could not possibly have.  For this reason I think that the overall impression of the book, that the Chinese and not the Europeans were first to chart the Americas, is accurate and well documented.  Of course the author takes some artistic license with the timeline and narrative, but the evidence is solid and surely to be backed up with genetic data acquired by the Human Genome Project, as the Chinese left colonies here and there in the Americas and this explains the Asian allele frequencies researchers are finding in the Americas.  Overall a good read and recommended.
B009GED1IY|5.0|I watched this movie over and over. Ever since I first watched Rock of ages, it has quickly become one of my favorite movies. The music and storyline are just addicting.
B008220C92|4.0|For whatever reason, there is something eerie about old home video tapes, especially when unexplained and horrible things happen to the people in them. Ethan Hawke plays a crime novelist who writes about unsolved cases and puts an extra spin on his book by actually moving to the scene of the crime. He gets in a little over his head, though, when he moves into a house in which a family was recently found hanging from the limb of a large tree.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* As he searches for clues as to how this family died, he stumbles onto a box of old home movies that date back 30 years, and in each video, another killing took place. Hawke discovers a connection to the occult, but becomes even more confused when a series of supernatural events start to occur within the house. He enlists the help of a local deputy to track down details about each crime, and what he discovers, of course, sets the movie up for a twist at the end. The only thing lacking in this film was the ending, given the fact that Hawke's characler seemed so intelligent and determined during the first half of the film, only to become naive and forgetful during the latter stages. The film is not gory, but it does tend to stay with you after you leave the theater.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldnt wait to read this book! It didn't disappoint! I love the story of Eva and Gideon! It simply left you wanting more...The characters stories are so well developed that you feel like you know them and are part of their story. Evokes every emotion.. simply AMAZING!
0525953728|3.0|God bless the men that do what these guys do and the sacrifices that they make.  America owes them a debt that can't be re-paid.  I desperately wanted to love this book but to be honest it was only OK.  Despite this I think all Americans should read it to get a glimpse into what these guys do for a living.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This trilogy is better than 50 Shades!! Cant wait for the next one to come out!! Cant believe its going to be so long!! Absolutely Love It!!!!
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Very good read. It could have lost about 50-75 pages to get rid of the tedious parts in the middle (I bought the version with the author's preferred texts) but all in all it was a good book. Symbolism, mysticism, magic, life/death, netherworld, pain, suffering, longing, etc - it's all in this book.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This manual was a great help to me while trying to format a manuscript for Kindle publishing. As a free download, it's a no-brainer to anyone interested in learning more about Kindle formatting. Ultimately, it did not provide all the solutions needed for me personally and I did end up paying Createspace to format the manuscript, but I do not consider myself the most tech-savvy person, so I cannot place the failing on this guide. I think it is certainly possible to follow this guide and achieve a complete \\"Do-It-Yourself\\" result; just didn't happen for me. But hey, my book is up for sale, so why complain right? Ok, shameless plug: [[ASIN:B009OU64WU The Exiled Heir (Autumn's Fall Saga)]]
B005HI4LMS|5.0|To set the record straight on this delightful B-flick, this is Eli Craig's debut that made it all the way to select premiers, including the ever-hard-to-aquire Sundance Film Festival. You don't have to be a fan of slasher flicks or even prescribe to the Predictably Cheesy genre either. Mr. Craig is an obvious fan of both types of films and pairs the main characters beautifully, who by their own rights have some chops in TV and film, Tyler Labine has the critically acclaimed Reaper to his credit and Alan Tudyk can respectably claim Firefly/Serenity.<br />  Eli Craig does a great job poking fun at the run of the mill but he does it respectably and humorously with plain old comedy, gore, and wit. The chemistry is good between the two friends, maybe a tad shaky on Katrina Bowden's part (thankfully she doesn't own the majority of the screen time), and is not what you'd expect from the low budget. You sci-fi fans will recognize a few of the other actors and also appreciate the twist put on this movie.<br />  It was a recommend on my Netflix account and I was a fan ten minutes in. Everyone I've referred this to loves it. There's just something endearing and well done about it. It won't help you decide who to vote for the in the next election but it will make you feel good that you watched it.<br />  Grab some friends along with some munchies and beers. It's well worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch it.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|This review has nothing to do with the content of these books.  I think that Game of Thrones is one of the most well written books I have read in quite some time.  This review is for the boxed set version of books 1-4.  Getting a bundle like this does save a bit of $, but the kindle version has screwed up pages.  It basically gives you the page numbers for book 1 (695 pages), but every page after says 695.  It makes it hard to see where you have progressed.  Part of this is because the kindle version lumps all 4 books into 1 large book.  This is definatley a negative when taking on a series.  I have the same problem with the Sookie Stackhouse novels (you can tell I like reading novels that are turned into HBO shows).  I think the cheapest way to purchase these books is at Target or Walmart, but if you want the kindle versions, I would suggest purchasing the books separately.  It may cost a little more, but it will be worth it.<br /><br />I purchased the series 6 weeks ago and just noticed the page issue after finishing book 1.  Amazon refunded my $ after I called and complained.  I will use the refund to purchase books 2, 3 and 4.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|So the game is awesome and super fun but like after five minutes of playing it started freezing up and made my kindle restart all on it's own.. plus the shop wasn't working, but I removed it and am adding it too see if it will work because its sooooo fun!! :)
B004LWZW42|2.0|The DVD author used a non-standard method of recording subtitles. This makes it impossible to use both English dialogue and other dialogue subtitles, requiring manually switching subtitle tracks mid-film and rewinding.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Stick to the age group that garnered so much success with Harry Potter.  I was extremely disappointed.  The plot doesn't move fast enough and when everything started to come together, it simply fizzled out.  British readers probably understood the slang and the profane words, but I didn't think that they added anything to the story.  The ending really made me wonder why I had read the book in the first place.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The book was good however it got a little slow in the middle. Can't wait to start the next book. It has a good love story but also has a great family bond feeling about it.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|I had great hopes for this film.... Unfortunately, I was disappointed as this film was a weak remake of alien. All the characters were essentially the same but played by worse actors and the film ground to a halt three quarters through with an extremely corny ending.
B00447G29S|5.0|I've had a 3d television w/blu ray for about a year now.  At first there was a real dearth of material available for this relatively new home technology.  One of my first movie purchases was this movie.  When I made the purchase I didn't follow my usual rule of reading reviews on Amazon first.  As I waited for the movie to arrive I decided to read the reviews I became concerned.  A lot of people gave the 3d version poor reviews, but look a little further and you'll find that most of the reviews are for the 3d version for a standard television.  In short I own many titles in 3d blu ray format and this is amongst the best in my opinion.
B0097UO87U|5.0|Favorites include: \\"She\\" (What a heartfelt rendition! Great Lyric and great Vocal Harmony!), \\"If I Loved You\\", \\"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\\" (Again great harmonic content), and \\"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\\". Old ELO fans will love this. All songs, although covers, sound fresh and new.I actually hear a tad of McCartney influence. It's nice to see old rockers still relevant in this day. Keep it up, Jeff! Thanks.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Heard a lot about this trilogy so couldn't wait to read it, a bit repetitive at times, take away all the sex and the story line is actually quite good. Although I was able to skip a few pages and still follow it which I's not good really,
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the view is messed up and its really starting to get irritating. I keep checking for an update but nothing.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I was very pleased and excited with this purchase. If I had known how awesome this show was when it first came out, I would have purchased it sooner. This is a must have series. I'm so pleased that I was able to purchase this from Amazon. 5 stars
B0063IH60K|5.0|Challenging yet relaxing. Easy to download compadable with Galaxy tablet. Well done, definately a 5 star experiance. Would happily reccomend to friends.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I give this book no stars.  Characters not appealing, sick people.  Lousy ending.  Made me want to take a shower to get the creepys off...
B008G12ERC|3.0|I really like this music work by Muse. There is an issue. Muse's music in general looks like it is made for movies. They sound epic, grandiose, they have a flare of Queen in them. But when this \\"epic\\" is felt in most of the songs the whole work could be heavy on the ears. It seems it is their \\"mark\\" and I think that is affecting this band to have a worldwide blockbuster (not that they are looking to have it). The Second song is awesome, simple and snappy without not being Muse. It is a great record if you like Muse.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Again Joe Nesbo writes a terrific page-turner of a murder mystery involving the author's Norwegian ex-detective hero, Harry Hole. Harry returns to Olso, Norway after three years of self-imposed exile in Hong Kong, to investiagate a particular drug related murder. This murder is personal to Harry, because the murder suspect is ,Oleg, the son of his long time girl friend, Rakel.  The story revolves around a secretive Russian drug cartel, headed by a druglord known only as Mr. Dubai, who is pushing a new and very addictive drug called \\"violin\\" on the streets. As Harry tries to prove Oleg is innocent of the murder, we meet several old and new characters in the police department and in the political world who are all interconnected in protecting the drug trafficers, and in stopping Harry from discovering the truth.  Mr. Nesbo also, thoughout the story writes from the viewpoint of the young murdered drug addict, named Gusto, thinking back to how he got involved with Mr. Dubai, and up to the final seconds of his life. The novel is a roller coaster ride, keeping the reader guessing up to the climatic confrontation between the murderer and Harry Hole. I hope this was not the last Harry Hole detective story, because the author leaves you guessing what happened next.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|It does get a bit boring at times because its so long, but it is straight to the point and just like Shakespeares play.
1423140605|4.0|This book was hard to put down once you got started.  If you like Greek mythology you will love all of Rick Riordan 's books!  The ending was different.
B007HNG5B6|5.0|Just finished the first book and now I'm into the first season. Worth the money! Most of the actors they picked for the characters in the book are fairly accurate. The children have been aged a bit from their ages in the book, but that's to be expected of course.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed does not show beyond the first dozen or so items.  It is a widespread problem from what I have read online, so it should be addressed with an update.

B004XQO8JG|3.0|When the film begins there is a voice over saying something like, \\"Every 5 minutes in America there is a robbery, every 10 minutes there is murder, every 20 minutes a rape\\". Then it shows a shadowy character clinking together two axes above their head. I kind of suspected vigilant's. Instead the bad guys are an underworld army trying to forement a revolution and as a group they clink their axes and picks above their heads. It might have made some sense if this were filmed in the 1960's or early 70's. Instead it has a more timeless feel to it but perhaps it's just a film that makes no sense at all, at least in any kind of real world way. For some reason Cobra did better in Europe than in America. A more interesting review might try and explain why.<br /><br />This is basically a copy of the Dirty Harry movies with Sylvester Stallone in the lead instead of Clint Eastwood. It seems careful not to do more than that as if the producers didn't take time to investigate what real cops do and instead based this on other cop movies.<br /><br />In some ways the character of 'Cobra' played by Stallone is more grounded in reality than Dirty Harry. He doesn't give his superiors quite as hard a time as Harry does and there are less speech like statements about 'justice'. In some ways the film is farther 'out there' in Cobra's exotic taste in weapons, clothing and cars. In one scene he's wearing a fancy black overcoat more like something Wesley Snipes would later wear playing a vampire.<br /><br />The mad criminal in the first Dirty Harry movie, the unlucky punk, plays a police chief in this movie. You expect this is a redeeming movie or something but instead Cobra punches this police chief for being less than helpful. At the end, after capturing the bad guys, the chief tells Cobra, \\"No hard feelings\\"? Cobra punches him one and replies, \\"No hard feelings\\" There are other surprises as well in that Cobra will get his car crashed up in chases and not always get his man. For me, the best thing about the film are the scenes with no dialog and nice background music that make it seem more like a music video.<br /><br />2/3rds of the way through the film we learn for the first time the main characters last name is 'Cobretti', so I suppose we could consider this a serious movie instead of the kind of dumb one it really is. When the film came out it received a trouncing from critics. A favorite critique was about the scene where Cobra is riding in the back bed of a pickup truck while firing a machine gun at a number of biker's chasing him, \\"would you really chase after someone firing a machine gun at you while riding a motorbike?\\". I took this as a way to show the fanaticism of the criminal gang the city faced. It must be a huge gang, apparently. Cobra must kill or incapacity over 100 criminals but they just keep coming as if they are baddies spawned by a video game. At least twice it's explained that Cobra works on the 'Zombie Squad'. Considering the abandon with which Cobra wastes bad guys the squad might be aptly named. If there were allusions here touching on zombie movies which were popular at the time the references must have been deleted before the final edit.<br /><br />I give this 3 stars because I liked some of the fantasy elements to the movie and I liked the portions that reminded me of music videos of the era. At least it has something to recommend it. I think I may have actually liked the character Cobra, at least compared to all the other cops - Dirty Harry, Axle Foley, Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis and Jackie Chan. Too bad this movie had such a dumb name, and is admittedly kinda dumb in some other ways.st thing about the film are the scenes with no dialog and nice background music that make it seem more like a music video.<br /><br />2/3rds of the way through the film we learn for the first time the main characters last name is 'Cobretti', so I suppose we could consider this a serious movie instead of the kind of dumb one it really is.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I had the first season and said I am getting them over again in blue ray. So love it even more ;-)
B009C5Z112|3.0|Let me preface this that this is not a bad album, but like the game Portal 2 when compared to Portal, it has some big shoes to fill from the initial Wintersun release. It feels unfair to compare it to the previous album, but if you're familiar with it, it may serve as a jumping off point.<br /><br />The album is very orchestral and experimental, departing a bit from the more death metal sound. Personally I'm a fan of more experimental sounding metal (see Between the buried and me, Ne Obliviscaris, Opeth to name a few), so 13 minute songs and fiddle portions are alright to me though. Rather than specific guitar breakdowns and solos, the instrumentation is more of an ongoing process. This is not to say that the work is not intricate and amazing, but as it is somewhat omnipresent, you tend to forget it's there.<br /><br />The final sound mixing also sound a bit... bad; like all the levels were normalized rather than augmented to work best with eachother. It's like when you listen to an old album by one of your favorite bands but you can't get into it because they were recording it in their basement with a computer microphone. Alright, it's not that bad, but I can't help but think it could have been mixed to have a more emotional impact.<br /><br />All in all, Jari is up to his old amazing tricks, and don't kid yourself, it's still an amazing album. Get past the iffy mixing and prepare to turn off shuffle while you enjoy this album as a journey from start to end.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|My family and I are HUGE fans of THE WALKING DEAD and this is sooooo much better then the picture shows. I am ordering another one to use as movie book ends ;-)
B003TH41H4|5.0|This is an excellent series in every measurable way, especially for a fantasy-action TV series based off very complex books. Its sad that there is only 2 seasons but theirs a good amount of people both working on that fans and famous individuals alike. SO have hope people and we will see some of this Kiwi actors on the screen again! Also as a final thought I think the reason this show failed was its reliance on Craig Horner, the seeker is like the doctor from doctor who the body and personality changes, your supposed to get attached to the ideal as well as the character and if they switched up the seeker maybe the show would of worked better? I dunno just a thought. Enjoy the 2 seasons that are here tho watch it in high def cause you can!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ok...first off, for those who actually gave this movie one-star, I recommend they either go back and sit through 'Alien' first, or stop commenting...this movie is far better than the first in the franchise, but it IS BASED on the premise that you have the intellect to understand what it means and represents, as well as a THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE of the overall Alien franchise.<br /><br />If you haven't seen ALIEN, then do so BEFORE you watch this movie. Yes, it is a prequel...but you really need that first movie (1st in sequence, but 2nd in chronology) to actually understand the significance of the overall storyline.<br /><br />That said...the cinematography was EXCELLENT, the story great, the meshing with Alien was very good...and while I understand the overall premise, I did manage to catch one technical gaff...regarding the 'space jockey' engineer...from Alien vs Prometheus...and that is in regards to the mummy found that 'had his ribs busted outward' that in Prometheus had not only 'left the chair', but you also see that 'the ribs' aren't ribs, but are part of a 'securement suit'...yet they show 'broken bones' in Alien...this is the ONLY discontinuity that I saw in the whole movie...<br /><br />For that one gaff, I give this a 4-star rating...FAR BETTER than Cameron's AVATAR...this is dark, moody, dirty, scary, more-real for what ANYONE in the middle of no-where would quite possibly face...instead of some 'smurf world' with eco-friendly blue elves.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it...see it today. I've watched it three times already, and still soaking in storyline details...definitely a 'deep intellect' movie worth the money!
B005SAY404|1.0|Give this less than 1 because I ordered it & was not able to get the show to play....followed the process instructed...a few times. Love the show, looked forward to seeing a re-run but never saw it. Got the bill though......would like it charged off.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great game.  Keeps me busy for hours and hours.  I never tire of it.  Even though it's the same thing over and over,<br />it is still challenging to get to the end.  Would love to have more like this.  It never freezes - never had a problem with it.<br />Perhaps it's because it's on my Kindle Fire which I love.  Highly recommend this game.

0060786523|5.0|This is an amazing story with rich characters and so intricately woven - once you have finished, you will be in absolute awe. It's one of the longest books I have read but you won't notice the length once the story has gripped you - and it will.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Richie Sambora is my favorite artist of all time. This album is awesome. It shows his roots and that is what I love so much about it. He put his heart and soul into it. While he was making this album he kept in touch with his followers on twitter and even twitted myself and others back. I truly feel that I was connected to Richie during the time this album came together. I wouldnt trade this experience for anything in my life. This album is awesome and any fan will love it. Even if you have never been a fan of Richie, you will love it too. Take that chance.
0316228532|3.0|Some reviewers asked for a Constance Garnett Russian novel translation sort of list of characters and I had already prepared this for my own (forgetful) use:<br /><br />Barry Fairbrother, 40, Parish Councillor, banker, dies first chapter; wife/widow Mary; four children (twin daughters Niamh and Siobhan; sons Declan, Fergus)<br /><br />Miles Mollison, lawyer, partner with Gavin; wife Samantha owns ladies' bra shop; daughters Lexie, Libby<br /><br />Howard Mollison, 64, Miles's father, Councillor, deli owner, fat; wife Shirley, hospital volunteer; opposed Barry F; children Miles, Patricia (in London)<br /><br />Gavin Hughes, 34, solicitor, Kay's lover<br /><br />Colin \\"Cubby\\" Wall, deputy headmaster; wife Tessa, guidance counselor; son Studart (Fats)<br /><br />Simon Price, printer; wife Ruth, nurse; sons Andrew, Paul<br /><br />Drs.

0307341550|4.0|It was difficult to get into this book at first and to be honest, I thought \\"Amma\\" was their grandma at first, so the entire time I'm picturing a little old lady until later it was explained this was a 13 year old girl. About half way through the book, it picked up and got interesting. I was also surprised by the end, not because it wasn't plausible, but because I didn't see it coming. I'm glad I read it, but probably wouldn't recommend or read again.  :0)
1401937519|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time, and believe me, I've read a lot of books.<br /><br />There is so much more value here than you might expect from a book about a near-death experience (NDE). You will find it not only comforting with regard to death (your own or those you love) but it's an affirmation of life, and inspiring in general. Just as important, you'll find it helpful in many practical ways.<br /><br />You can benefit from this book if:<br /><br />- You or someone you know is facing death<br />- You're grieving the death of a loved one, including a pet<br />- You're facing illness of any kind, serious or otherwise<br />- You're experiencing challenging emotions such as depression or lack of interest in life<br />- You want to feel more whole, healthy, and vibrant<br />- You simply want to feel better in general ... happier, more at peace, more purposeful, etc.<br />- You would like an enlightened way to understand or experience life and your place in it<br /><br />As you can see, I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. And it's a book that I envision myself reviewing periodically for my own benefit.<br /><br />Anita begins by setting the stage with a brief biography of relevant parts of her life. She describes the experience of becoming incapacitated with terminal cancer, and I love that she describes its unfolding not only on the outside but from \\"the inside\\" as well.<br /><br />But fairly quickly, she jumps right into the NDE. This is the part I want everyone to read who has ever lost anyone to death, or is facing it themselves. The way she describes it is breath-taking and eye-opening. It's beautiful, actually, and you'll never forget it.<br /><br />And just as extraordinary is the explanation of how she then \\"came back\\" and proceeded to completely heal. Yes, completely! And how she learned to allow for this \\"unfolding of miracles\\" as she puts it.<br /><br />So it's not just a book about death and what happens at that moment.<br /><br />It's even more a book about life; about who and what you are; about healing and wholeness ... and about allowing your whole world to transform.<br /><br />It's fascinating to read how you -- as your essence -- live even through death. And much more freely than you probably are now!<br /><br />So how can you live with that same freedom even as you live your life?<br /><br />In her quest to help others through her experience, she shares her thoughts about how you can apply what she's come to know.<br /><br />From her expanded understanding of reality, she shares in a way that you can apply in everyday life:<br /><br />- Why she got sick and how she healed<br />- How to connect with the soul of your magnificence<br />- Experiencing profound freedom in your life<br />- Trusting the wisdom of the infinite self<br />- What it means to Be (allow) vs. Do -- and thus experience vast inner peace and a beautiful flow in your life<br /><br />You've really got to read it yourself since there's so much more to it than I could even put words to; pretty apropos given its expansive nature.<br /><br />And I'm sure you'll find your own gems within it, probably new and different insights and practices each time you read it, depending on your perspectives at that time.<br /><br />It's got a richness and depth to it that I enjoy applying and know I will for years to come.<br /><br />Note: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes, and this review reflects my honest evaluation.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I never had the chance to see this awesome series on TV from its inception.  So, I have been doing a lot of catch up and I've been been intrigued by the very first episode.  You just can't wait to see what happens next.  Well written show and top notch actors.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this app because I am not good at chess so I can play it and have more practice. sometimes the computer is tough to beat though. the graphics are also better then a lot of free strategic apps like this. I would recommend it since its free!
